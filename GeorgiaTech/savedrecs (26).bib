Abstract = {{Tongue drive system (TDS) is a new wireless assistive technology (AT)
   for the mobility impaired population. It provides users with the ability
   to drive powered wheelchairs (PWC) and access computers using their
   unconstrained tongue motion. Migration of the TDS processing unit and
   user interface platform from a bulky personal computer to a smartphone
   (iPhone) has significantly facilitated its usage by turning it into a
   true wireless and wearable AT. After implementation of the necessary
   interfacing hardware and software to allow the smartphone to act as a
   bridge between the TDS and PWC, the wheelchair navigation performance
   and associated learning was evaluated in nine able-bodied subjects in
   five sessions over a 5-week period. Subjects wore magnetic tongue studs
   over the duration of the study and drove the PWC in an obstacle course
   with their tongue using three different navigation strategies; namely
   unlatched, latched, and semiproportional. Qualitative aspects of using
   the TDS-iPhone-PWC interface were also evaluated via a five-point Likert
   scale questionnaire. Subjects showed more than 20\% improvement in the
   overall completion time between the first and second sessions, and
   maintained a modest improvement of similar to 9\% per session over the
   following three sessions.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of interface-trap states (D-it) and the shift of the charge
   neutrality level (CNL) on the enhancement of the drain current in
   In-rich surface-channel enhancement-mode n-type InGaAs MOSFETs are
   investigated. In addition to the increase in the bulk mobility, the
   shift of the CNL toward the conduction band together with high densities
   of D-it is responsible for the experimentally observed remarkable
   enhancement of the ON-state drain current with increasing In content in
   the channel. However, when D-it is low, current enhancement is weak, and
   the location of the CNL has little effect on the current enhancement.
   Acceptor-type interface-trap states above the conduction-band minima
   (CBM) play an important role in determining the inversion-layer electron
   mobility. Representing D-it distribution above the CBM by a constant
   equal to the D-it value at the CNL causes an overestimation of the drain
   current at higher gate voltages. It is also observed that the extraction
   of D-it from the low-frequency gate C-V data is independent of the
   location of the CNL. We further show that the subthreshold slope (SS) is
   doubled due to D-it. However, the location of the CNL or the magnitude
   of D-it above the CBM has little effect on the SS.}},

Abstract = {{Critical-sized bone defect regeneration is a remaining clinical concern.
   Numerous scaffold-based strategies are currently being investigated to
   enable in vivo bone defect healing. However, a deeper understanding of
   how a scaffold influences the tissue formation process and how this
   compares to endogenous bone formation or to regular fracture healing is
   missing. It is hypothesized that the porous scaffold architecture can
   serve as a guiding substrate to enable the formation of a structured
   fibrous network as a prerequirement for later bone formation. An ovine,
   tibial, 30-mm critical-sized defect is used as a model system to better
   understand the effect of the scaffold architecture on cell organization,
   fibrous tissue, and mineralized tissue formation mechanisms in vivo.
   Tissue regeneration patterns within two geometrically distinct
   macroscopic regions of a specific scaffold design, the scaffold wall and
   the endosteal cavity, are compared with tissue formation in an empty
   defect (negative control) and with cortical bone (positive control).
   Histology, backscattered electron imaging, scanning small-angle X-ray
   scattering, and nanoindentation are used to assess the morphology of
   fibrous and mineralized tissue, to measure the average mineral particle
   thickness and the degree of alignment, and to map the local elastic
   indentation modulus. The scaffold proves to function as a guiding
   substrate to the tissue formation process. It enables the arrangement of
   a structured fibrous tissue across the entire defect, which acts as a
   secondary supporting network for cells. Mineralization can then initiate
   along the fibrous network, resulting in bone ingrowth into a
   critical-sized defect, although not in complete bridging of the defect.
   The fibrous network morphology, which in turn is guided by the scaffold
   architecture, influences the microstructure of the newly formed bone.
   These results allow a deeper understanding of the mode of mineral tissue
   formation and the way this is influenced by the scaffold architecture.

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide potentially has multiple applications. The chemistry of
   graphene oxide and its response to external stimuli such as temperature
   and light are not well understood and only approximately controlled.
   This understanding is crucial to enable future applications of this

   study shows that multilayer graphene oxide produced by oxidizing
   epitaxial graphene through the Hummers method is a metastable material
   whose structure and chemistry evolve at room temperature with a
   characteristic relaxation time of about one month. At the
   quasi-equilibrium, graphene oxide reaches a nearly stable reduced O/C
   ratio, and exhibits a structure deprived of epoxide groups and enriched
   in hydroxyl groups. Our calculations show that the structural and
   chemical changes are driven by the availability of hydrogen in the
   oxidized graphitic sheets, which favours the reduction of epoxide groups
   and the formation of water molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum bags are used in conjunction with autoclaves to generate the
   consolidation pressures and temperatures required to manufacture
   aerospace composites. As the scale of continuous fiber composite
   structures increases, autoclave processing becomes prohibitively
   expensive or infeasible. The objective of this study is to develop
   flexible magnetic clamping structures to increase the consolidation
   pressure during the conventional vacuum bagging of composite laminates,
   thereby obviating the need for an autoclave. The ferromagnetic rubber,
   which consists of rubber filled with iron particles, developed in this
   study provides a conformable and reusable vacuum bag that provides
   increased consolidation through attractive forces produced by
   electromagnets. Experiments and finite-element modeling indicate that
   consolidation pressure in the range of 100 kPa can be generated by such
   a device with realistic power requirements. The effects of the magnetic
   clamping device process parameters on the consolidation pressure
   magnitude are modeled theoretically and are characterized
   experimentally. In addition, a method for the efficient design of the
   magnetic-clamping device is developed. POLYM. COMPOS., 2012. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Microlens arrays are becoming increasingly important because of their
   widespread applications in optical, electronic, and energy fields.
   Currently, microlens array fabrication processes are mainly developed on
   planar substrates. For nonplanar substrates, existing fabrication
   methods suffer from various disadvantages. This is largely due to the
   inherent technical complexity associated with 3D microstructure
   fabrication processes. In this study, an innovative 3D fabrication
   method for microlens arrays on curved surfaces is introduced. To
   fabricate the microlens array, a polymethylmethacrylate micro lens array
   on a curved surface was used as projection optics. A thick layer of
   positive photoresist SPR 220 was spin coated on a curved,
   titanium-coated aluminum substrate. A pre-selected pattern was projected
   onto the photoresist by using a home built exposure system. The
   development process resulted in micro cylinders on the curved substrate.
   A thermal reflow process was then performed on the cylinder array to
   form the microlens array. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the
   factors that affect the shapes of the microlenses. These factors include
   film thickness variation, exposure and development variation, slope of
   the substrate, height to width ratio and heating time in thermal reflow
   process. Finally microlenses were tested using a Twyman-Green
   interferometer. Results showed that the required shape of the
   microlenses achieved by controlling the process parameters. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Through-silicon vias (TSVs) have two negative effects in the design of
   three-dimensional integrated circuits (3-D ICs). First, TSV insertion
   leads to silicon area overhead. In addition, nonnegligible TSV
   capacitance causes delay overhead in 3-D signal paths. Therefore,
   obtaining all benefits such as wirelength reduction and performance
   improvement from 3-D ICs is highly dependent on TSV size and
   capacitance. Meanwhile, TSVs are downscaled to minimize their negative
   effects, and sub-micron TSVs are expected to be fabricated in the near
   future. At the same time, the devices are also downscaled beyond 32 nm
   and 22 nm, so future 3-D ICs will very likely be built with sub-micron
   TSVs and advanced device technologies. In this paper, we investigate the
   impact of sub-micron TSVs on the quality of today and future 3-D ICs.
   For future process technologies, we develop 22 nm and 16 nmlibraries.
   Using these future process libraries and an existing 45 nm library, we
   generate 3-D IC layouts with different TSV sizes and capacitances and
   study the impact of sub-micron TSVs thoroughly.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Grid-wide monitoring of utility assets is essential for maintaining a
   healthy and reliable power grid. Electric current is an important
   parameter for grid monitoring. Expensive and large current sensors that
   require field calibration inhibit utilities from implementing an
   intelligent monitoring infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel
   technique and algorithm for current sensing using small, low-cost
   ``stick-on{''} current sensors that do not require clamping around the
   utility conductor. Thus, the proposed sensor can be used for monitoring
   many different utility conductors (not just overhead-conductors). The
   challenge pertaining to error in current measurement due to the presence
   of other current carrying assets in proximity has been tackled. The new
   current sensing technique is shown to discriminate far magnetic fields
   from the near-field of interest; eliminate expensive calibration
   requirements for the sensor, and provide accurate current measurements
   in a noisy magnetic field environment. Simulation and experimental
   results are presented to validate the proposed concept. The proposed
   technique for current sensing promises development of low-cost smart
   sensors that will be an integral part of the future smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{A second-order, general dynamics, relative motion framework is
   formulated to solve for optimal finite-bum transfers in complex gravity
   fields that are not amenable to analytic solutions. The second-order
   variational equations are employed in a Cartesian frame that is general
   in fidelity and simple to implement. For a passive chief orbit we show
   that only 16 coefficient functions are necessary to accommodate most
   dynamical environments of interest. We pre-compute and curve-fit the
   coefficient functions which represent the time-varying Jacobians and
   Hessians of the state equations evaluated along the chief orbit. Once
   the coefficient functions are evaluated, the resulting CUrve-fit
   quadRatic Variational Equations (CURVE) model is almost transparent to
   the fidelity level and therefore is well suited for the repeated
   iterations required by nonlinear optimization. The optimal control
   problem is solved using a robust, second-order technique that is a
   variant of differential dynamic programming. The model and optimal
   rendezvous problems are demonstrated in the highly perturbed dynamical
   environment of the Martian moon Deimos. The resulting implementation is
   useful for any relative motion application requiring optimal targeting,
   particularly in the context of complex force fields. While intended
   primarily for exotic destinations such as the Moon, asteroids, comets,
   and planetary satellites, the CURVE model and optimal control framework
   can also be useful for Earth orbiters, especially in cases of large
   eccentricity and high fidelity geopotentials.}},

Title = {{Endothelialized Microfluidics for Studying Microvascular Interactions in
   Hematologic Diseases}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{64}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Advances in microfabrication techniques have enabled the production of
   inexpensive and reproducible microfluidic systems for conducting
   biological and biochemical experiments at the micro-and nanoscales
   (1,2). In addition, microfluidics have also been specifically used to
   quantitatively analyze hematologic and microvascular processes, because
   of their ability to easily control the dynamic fluidic environment and
   biological conditions(3-6). As such, researchers have more recently used
   microfluidic systems to study blood cell deformability, blood cell
   aggregation, microvascular blood flow, and blood cell-endothelial cell
   interactions(6-13). However, these microfluidic systems either did not
   include cultured endothelial cells or were larger than the sizescale
   relevant to microvascular pathologic processes. A microfluidic platform
   with cultured endothelial cells that accurately recapitulates the
   cellular, physical, and hemodynamic environment of the microcirculation
   is needed to further our understanding of the underlying biophysical
   pathophysiology of hematologic diseases that involve the
   microvasculature.
   Here, we report a method to create an ``endothelialized{''} in vitro
   model of the microvasculature, using a simple, single mask
   microfabrication process in conjunction with standard endothelial cell
   culture techniques, to study pathologic biophysical microvascular
   interactions that occur in hematologic disease. This
   ``microvasculature-on-a-chip{''} provides the researcher with a robust
   assay that tightly controls biological as well as biophysical conditions
   and is operated using a standard syringe pump and
   brightfield/fluorescence microscopy. Parameters such as microcirculatory
   hemodynamic conditions, endothelial cell type, blood cell type(s) and
   concentration(s), drug/inhibitory concentration etc., can all be easily
   controlled. As such, our microsystem provides a method to quantitatively
   investigate disease processes in which microvascular flow is impaired
   due to alterations in cell adhesion, aggregation, and deformability, a
   capability unavailable with existing assays.}},

Journal = {{COASTAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{127-138}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Stereo video techniques are effective for estimating the space-time wave
   dynamics over an area of the ocean. Indeed, a stereo camera view allows
   retrieval of both spatial and temporal data whose statistical content is
   richer than that of time series data retrieved from point wave probes.
   To prove this, we consider an application of the Wave Acquisition Stereo
   System (WASS) for the analysis of offshore video measurements of gravity
   waves in the Northern Adriatic Sea. In particular, we deployed WASS at
   the oceanographic platform Acqua Alta, off the Venice coast, Italy.
   Three experimental studies were performed, and the overlapping field of
   view of the acquired stereo images covered an area of approximately 1100
   m(2). Analysis of the WASS measurements show that the sea surface can be
   accurately estimated in space and time together, yielding associated
   directional spectra and wave statistics that agree well with theoretical
   models. From the observed wavenumber-frequency spectrum one can also
   predict the vertical profile of the current flow underneath the wave
   surface. Finally, future improvements of WASS and applications are
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scalable fabrication of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles is essential to
   future advances in several applications. Here, we report on the
   development of a simple, two-step method for fabricating vertically
   aligned and periodically distributed CNT bundles and periodically porous
   CNT films at the sub-micron scale. The method involves laser
   interference ablation (LIA) of an iron film followed by CNT growth via
   iron-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition. CNT bundles with square widths
   ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mu m in width, and 50-200 mu m in length, are
   grown atop the patterned catalyst over areas spanning 8 cm(2). The CNT
   bundles exhibit a high degree of control over square width, orientation,
   uniformity, and periodicity. This simple scalable method of producing
   well-placed and oriented CNT bundles demonstrates a high application
   potential for wafer-scale integration of CNT structures into various
   device applications, including IC interconnects, field emitters,
   sensors, batteries, and optoelectronics, etc.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the overall barrier performance of multilayer thin-films
   and the shelf lifetime of encapsulated organic solar cells were
   correlated through the total amount of water vapor that permeated into
   the solar cell. Effective water vapor transmission rates were measured
   in both the transient and steady-state transport regimes for multilayer
   barrier films consisting of SiNx and parylene. The efficiency of
   pentacene/C-60-based solar cells encapsulated with one or two pairs of
   SiNx/parylene dropped to 50\% after permeation of about 1.63 g/m(2) of
   water vapor regardless of effective transmission rate of the barrier.
   From these calculations, cells encapsulated with three dyads were
   predicted to maintain performance for at least 13,500 h while
   experiments up to 7500 h showed less than 10\% degradation in
   performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human operators have difficulty driving cranes quickly, accurately, and
   safely because the heavy structure of the crane responds slowly and its
   payload oscillates. Manipulation difficulty is increased by nonintuitive
   control interfaces (such as buttons, levers, and joysticks) that require
   substantial experience to master. This paper presents a new type of
   interface that allows operators to drive a crane by simply moving a
   hand-held radio-frequency tag through the desired path. Real-time
   location sensors are used to track the movements of the tag and its
   position is used in a feedback control loop to drive the crane.
   Unfortunately, crane movements usually induce large-amplitude payload
   oscillations. Therefore, an input-shaping control element is used to
   limit payload swing. Experimental results on an industrial bridge crane
   validate the controller performance.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the field performance of flexure-based mobile
   sensing nodes (FMSNs) developed for system identification and condition
   monitoring of civil structures. Each FMSN consists of a tetherless
   magnetic wall-climbing robot capable of navigating on steel structures,
   measuring structural vibrations, processing measurement data, and
   wirelessly communicating information. The flexible body design of the
   FMSN allows it to negotiate with sharp corners on a structure, and
   attach/detach an accelerometer onto/from structural surface. Our
   previous research investigated the performance of the FMSNs through
   laboratory experiments. The FMSNs were deployed to identify minor
   structural damage, illustrating a high sensitivity in damage detection
   enabled by flexible mobile deployment. This paper investigates the field
   performance of the FMSNs with a pedestrian bridge on the Georgia Tech
   campus. Multiple FMSNs navigate to different sections of the steel
   bridge and measure structural vibrations at high spatial resolution.
   Using data collected by a small number of FMSNs, detailed modal
   characteristics of the bridge are identified. A finite element (FE)
   model for the bridge is constructed. The FE model is updated based on
   the modal characteristics extracted from the FMSN data.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the interest to develop an agile, high-efficiency robotic
   fish for underwater applications where safe environment for
   data-acquisition without disturbing the surrounding during exploration
   is of particular concern, this paper presents computational and
   experimental results of a biologically inspired mechanical undulating
   fin. The findings offer intuitive insights for optimizing the design of
   a fin-based robotic fish that offers several advantages including low
   underwater acoustic noise, dexterous maneuverability, and better
   propulsion efficiency at low speeds. Specifically, this paper begins
   with the design of a robotic fish developed for experimental
   investigation and for validating computational hydrodynamic models of an
   undulating fin. A relatively complete computational model describing the
   hydrodynamics of an undulating fin is given for analyzing the effect of
   propagating wave motions on the forces acting on the fin surface. The
   3-D unsteady fluid flow around the undulating fin has been numerically
   solved using computational fluid dynamics method. These numerically
   simulated pressure and velocity distributions acting on the undulating
   fin, which provide a basis to compute the forces acting on the
   undulating fin, have been experimentally validated by comparing the
   computed thrust against data measured on a prototype flexible-fin
   mechanism.}},

   construct an approximation of the environment at different levels of

   environment a graph, whose dimension can be made commensurate to the
   on-board computational resources of the agent. The adjacency list of the
   graph can be efficiently constructed directly from the approximation and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for distributed vision-aided
   cooperative localization and navigation for multiple inter-communicating
   autonomous vehicles based on three-view geometry constraints. Each
   vehicle is equipped with a standard inertial navigation system and an
   on-board camera only. In contrast to the traditional approach for
   cooperative localization, which is based on relative pose measurements,
   the proposed method formulates a measurement whenever the same scene is
   observed by different vehicles. Each such measurement is comprising of
   three images, which are not necessarily captured at the same time. The
   captured images, to which some navigation parameters are attached, are
   stored in repositories by some of the vehicles in the group. A
   graph-based approach is applied for calculating the correlation terms
   between the navigation parameters associated to images participating in
   the same measurement. The proposed method is examined using a
   statistical simulation and is further validated in an experiment that
   involved two vehicles in a holding pattern scenario. The experiments
   show that the cooperative three-view-based vision-aided navigation may
   considerably improve the performance of an inferior INS. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Cellular cardiomyoplasty has been limited by poor graft retention after
   cell transplantation. To ensure good retention of the engrafted cells, a
   microfluidic device was used to fabricate spherical porous beads of
   poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) as a platform for cell delivery. The
   beads thus obtained had a relatively uniform size, a highly porous
   structure, and a favorably interconnected interior architecture, to
   facilitate the transportation of oxygen and nutrients. These porous
   beads were loaded with human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) to
   generate cellularized microscaffolds. Live/dead assay demonstrated that
   most of the cells in the porous constructs were viable. The hAFSCs that
   were grown in beads formed a complex three-dimensional organization with
   well-preserved extracellular matrices (ECM) according to their porous
   structure. Retention of the administered beads was clearly identified at
   the site of engraftment following an experimentally induced myocardial
   infarction in a rat model. The results of echocardiography, magnetic
   resonance imaging, and histological analyses suggest that the
   transplantation of hAFSC beads into an infarcted heart could effectively
   maintain its gross morphology, prevent successive ventricular expansion,
   and thereby improve the post-infarcted cardiac function.
   Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the microenvironment that was
   provided by the infarcted myocardium might offer cues for the induction
   of the engrafted hAFSCs into angiogenic and cardiomyogenic lineages. Our
   results demonstrate that the cellularized beads with endogenously
   secreted ECM were of sufficient physical size to be entrapped in the
   interstitial tissues following transplantation, thereby benefiting the
   infarcted heart. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates how the experience learned in repeated
   transactions by consumers and manufacturers would affect supply-chain
   partners' strategic decisions such as price, order quantity and service
   level. Consumer demand depends on two factors: (1) retailer price and
   (2) service level provided by the manufacturer in the past and current
   transaction periods. Game theory is used to understand interactions
   between the horizontally competitive suppliers and their vertical
   interactions to the common retailer in the one-period looking-ahead
   decision environment. Dynamic-system concepts are integrated into the
   game-theoretic model for understanding the evolution of the strategic
   decisions over multiple time periods. The research shows that the
   manufacturer with any type of cost-advantage for providing more services
   to its customers will capture a larger market than its competitor.
   Comparison of our model to the myopic model indicates that the myopic
   suppliers, who ignore the customer learning effect on future periods,
   shrink their market sizes and earn less profit over time. The
   manufacturers who use the learning experience to plan future investment
   can prevent this phenomenon from happening and enhance their
   competitiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a degradable thermoset
   shape-memory polymer from poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE) networks. PBAE
   was chosen to be the crosslinker as it is biodegradable and has been
   projected as a potential material for biomedical applications. The low
   glass transition temperature of PBAE was increased to a biomedically
   relevant range using methyl methacrylate and methyl acrylate as the
   linear chain builders. The thermo-mechanical properties of the networks
   were tailored such that they exhibited onset of glass transition
   temperature in between the room temperature (22 degrees C) and the body
   temperature (37 degrees C). Free-strain recovery tests under heating and
   isothermal conditions were performed to quantify shape-memory behavior.
   Testing showed that sampled programmed at 10 degrees C initiated
   deformation recovery at a lower temperature and a faster rate as
   compared to programming at 60 degrees C. Higher thermal conductivity of
   water enabled the samples to recover faster in water than in air.
   Samples with higher PBAE crosslinking densities exhibited higher
   normalized mass loss under regular and accelerated conditions. The
   amount of water absorption in the networks also increased with the
   crosslinker concentration independent of the testing conditions. (C)

   waves}},
Journal = {{NDT \& E INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{10-15}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This research uses nonlinear Rayleigh waves to characterize the damage
   due to plastic deformation in A36 steel specimens subjected to
   quasi-static, monotonic tension, and low cycle fatigue. A36 steel is
   widely used in the civil infrastructure, such as steel bridges, where
   fatigue damage can lead to a catastrophic failure. Plastic deformation
   causes the generation of higher order harmonics in an initially
   monochromatic Rayleigh wave signal, and this measurable change occurs
   before macroscopic damage such as cracks appear in a specimen. This
   increase in the acoustic nonlinearity is produced by plasticity-induced
   microstructure changes, and thus can be taken as a direct measure of
   damage. Experiments are conducted using a pair of wedge transducers to
   generate and detect tone burst ultrasonic Rayleigh surface wave signals.
   The amplitudes of the first and second order harmonics are measured at
   different propagation distances to obtain the nonlinearity parameter for
   a given damage state throughout the fatigue life and monotonic loading
   process in three specimens. The results of the nonlinear ultrasonic
   measurements show an increase in the measured acoustic nonlinearity,
   especially in the early stages of fatigue life. In addition, there is a
   notably close relationship between the measured acoustic nonlinearity
   and the cumulative plastic deformation. These results demonstrate the
   feasibility of using nonlinear Rayleigh waves to characterize damage
   associated with plastic deformation, and this quantitative information
   can be a useful input for life prediction models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{Recent comparisons between satellite observed and global model simulated
   glyoxal (CHOCHO) have consistently revealed a large unknown source of
   CHOCHO over China. We examine this missing CHOCHO source by analyzing
   SCIAMACHY observed CHOCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) using a
   Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM). This missing source is first
   quantified by the difference between SCIAMACHY observed and REAM
   simulated CHOCHO VCDs (Delta C-CHOCHO), which have little overlap with
   high biogenic isoprene emissions but are collocated with dense
   population and high anthropogenic NOx and VOC emissions. We then apply
   inverse modeling to constrain CHOCHO precursor emissions based on
   SCIAMACHY CHOCHO and find that this missing source is most likely caused
   by substantially underestimated aromatics emissions (by a factor of
   4-10, varying spatially) in the VOC emission inventories over China used
   in current regional and global models. Comparison with in situ
   observations in Beijing, Shanghai, and a site in the Pearl River Delta
   shows that the large model biases in aromatics concentrations are
   greatly reduced after the inversion. The top-down estimated aromatics
   emission is 13.4 Tg yr(-1) in total, about 6 times the bottom-up
   estimate (2.4 Tg yr(-1)). The resulting impact on regional oxidant
   levels is large (e. g., similar to 100\% increase of PAN in the
   afternoon). Furthermore, since aromatics are important precursors of
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA), such an increase of aromatics could
   lead to similar to 50\% increase of global aromatic SOA production and
   thereby help to reduce the low bias of simulated organic aerosols over
   the region in previous modeling studies. Citation: Liu, Z., et al.

Abstract = {{Given the fundamental differences in carrier generation and device
   operation in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and organic
   photovoltaic (OPV) devices, the material design principles to apply may
   be expected to differ. In this respect, designing organic semiconductors
   that perform effectively in multiple device configurations remains a
   challenge. Following ``donor-acceptor{''} principles, we designed and
   synthesized an analogous series of solution-processable pi-conjugated
   polymers that combine the electron-rich dithienosilole (DTS) moiety,
   unsubstituted thiophene spacers, and the electron-deficient core
   2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). Insights into backbone geometry and wave
   function delocalization as a function of molecular structure are
   provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the
   B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Using a combination of X-ray techniques (2D-WAXS
   and XRD) supported by solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) and atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), we demonstrate fundamental correlations between the
   polymer repeat-unit structure, molecular weight distribution, nature of
   the solubilizing side-chains appended to the backbones, and extent of
   structural order attainable in p-channel OTFTs. In particular, it is
   shown that the degree of microstructural order achievable in the
   self-assembled organic semiconductors increases largely with (i)
   increasing molecular weight and (ii) appropriate solubilizing-group
   substitution. The corresponding field-effect hole mobilities are
   enhanced by several orders of magnitude, reaching up to 0.1 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1) the highest molecular weight fraction of the branched
   alkyl-substituted polymer derivative in this series. This trend is
   reflected in conventional bulk-heterojunction OPV devices using PC71BM,
   whereby the active layers exhibit space-charge-limited (SCL) hole
   mobilities approaching 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and yield improved power
   conversion efficiencies on the order of 4.6\% under AM1.5G solar
   illumination. Beyond structure performance correlations, we observe a
   large dependence of the ionization potentials of the polymers estimated
   by electrochemical methods on polymer packing, and expect that these
   empirical results may have important consequences on future material
   study and device applications.}},

   In order to improve the atomic level understanding of thorium-based
   fuels, we have developed eight interatomic potential descriptions of
   ThO2 by fitting the experimental lattice parameter, elastic constants
   and static dielectric constants. Using these interatomic potentials, we
   have calculated the structural and elastic properties, phase stability,
   defect formation energies, defect binding energies and complexes as well
   as the energetics of low-index surfaces. A critical assessment of all
   the potentials is performed by comparing the predicted properties with
   available experimental and first-principles calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic carbon nanotubes (m-CNTs) were tethered with y-Fe2O3
   nanoparticles that were formed via a novel modified sol-gel approach.
   These nanohybrid materials were readily aligned parallel to the
   direction of a magnetic field in polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrices under
   a relatively weak magnetic field. The composite films were characterized
   by XRD, and the crystallization kinetics of PEO in the presence of
   m-CNTs was measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The results
   indicated that the surface-tethered magnetic nanoparticles provided
   nucleation sites for the PEO crystal growth, while maintaining the
   spherulitic-shaped crystal morphology. The conductivity of the
   PEO-m-CNTs composite films increased with increasing m-CNTs content in
   the polymer matrix. Furthermore, the conductivities parallel to the
   direction of m-CNT alignment were higher than those in the perpendicular
   direction, indicating that the alignment of the m-CNTs contributed to
   the enhancement of the anisotropic electrical properties of the
   composites in the direction of alignment. The mechanical properties of
   the samples also show anisotropic behavior similar to that of the
   electrical properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   a disruption in the subsurface charge-order pattern, leading to an
   enrichment of Fe2+ cations at the APDB. Simulated STM images reproduce
   the appearance of the APDBs in the experimental data and reveal that

Abstract = {{Highly localized light-induced phase transformation of electron beam
   induced deposited carbon nanostructures (dots and squares) on noble
   metal surfaces is reported. The phase transformation from the amorphous
   phase to the disordered graphitic phase is analyzed using the
   characteristic Raman signatures for amorphous and graphitized carbon and
   conductive force microscopy. The extent of the transformation is found
   to be largely dependent on the plasmon absorption properties of the
   underlying metal film. It is observed that the amorphous carbon deposits
   on the silver films consisting of 12 nm particles with the plasmon
   absorption near the laser excitation wavelength (514 nm), undergo fast
   graphitization to a nanocrystalline or a disordered graphitic phase.
   This transformation results in the formation of a highly conductive
   carbon/metal interface with at least seven orders of magnitude lower
   electrical resistivity than the initial insulating interface. It is
   suggested that the fast graphitization of nanoscale carbon deposits
   might serve as an efficient path for the formation of complex patterned
   nanoscale metal-carbon interconnects with high electrical conductivity.}},

Title = {{Genomic determinants of organohalide-respiration in Geobacter lovleyi,
   an unusual member of the Geobacteraceae}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Geobacter lovleyi is a unique member of the Geobacteraceae
   because strains of this species share the ability to couple
   tetrachloroethene (PCE) reductive dechlorination to
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) with energy conservation and growth
   (i.e., organohalide respiration). Strain SZ also reduces U(VI) to U(IV)
   and contributes to uranium immobilization, making G. lovleyi relevant
   for bioremediation at sites impacted with chlorinated ethenes and
   radionuclides. G. lovleyi is the only fully sequenced representative of
   this distinct Geobacter clade, and comparative genome analyses
   identified genetic elements associated with organohalide respiration and
   elucidated genome features that distinguish strain SZ from other members
   of the Geobacteraceae.
   Results: Sequencing the G. lovleyi strain SZ genome revealed a 3.9 Mbp
   chromosome with 54.7\% GC content (i.e., the percent of the total
   guanines (Gs) and cytosines (Cs) among the four bases within the
   genome), and average amino acid identities of 53-56\% compared to other
   sequenced Geobacter spp. Sequencing also revealed the presence of a 77
   kbp plasmid, pSZ77 (53.0\% GC), with nearly half of its encoded genes
   corresponding to chromosomal homologs in other Geobacteraceae genomes.
   Among these chromosome-derived features, pSZ77 encodes 15 out of the 24
   genes required for de novo cobalamin biosynthesis, a required cofactor
   for organohalide respiration. A plasmid with 99\% sequence identity to
   pSZ77 was subsequently detected in the PCE-dechlorinating G. lovleyi
   strain KB-1 present in the PCE-to-ethene-dechlorinating consortium KB-1.
   Additional PCE-to-cis-DCE-dechlorinating G. lovleyi strains obtained
   from the PCE-contaminated Fort Lewis, WA, site did not carry a plasmid
   indicating that pSZ77 is not a requirement (marker) for PCE respiration
   within this species. Chromosomal genomic islands found within the G.
   lovleyi strain SZ genome encode two reductive dehalogenase (RDase)
   homologs and a putative conjugative pilus system. Despite the loss of
   many c-type cytochrome and oxidative-stress-responsive genes, strain SZ
   retained the majority of Geobacter core metabolic capabilities,
   including U(VI) respiration.
   Conclusions: Gene acquisitions have expanded strain SZ's respiratory
   capabilities to include PCE and TCE as electron acceptors. Respiratory
   processes core to the Geobacter genus, such as metal reduction, were
   retained despite a substantially reduced number of c-type cytochrome
   genes. pSZ77 is stably maintained within its host strains SZ and KB-1,
   likely because the replicon carries essential genes including genes
   involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and possibly corrinoid transport.
   Lateral acquisition of the plasmid replicon and the RDase genomic island
   represent unique genome features of the PCE-respiring G. lovleyi strains
   SZ and KB-1, and at least the latter signifies adaptation to PCE
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a subclass of nanoporous
   metal organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit zeolite-like structural
   topologies and have interesting molecular recognition properties, such
   as molecular sieving and gate-opening effects associated with their pore
   apertures. The synthesis and characterization of hybrid ZIFs with mixed
   linkers in the framework are described in this work, producing materials
   with properties distinctly different from the parent frameworks (ZIF-8,
   ZIF-90, and ZIF-7). NMR spectroscopy is used to assess the relative
   amounts of the different linkers included in the frameworks, whereas
   nitrogen physisorption shows the evolution of the effective pore size
   distribution in materials resulting from the framework hybridization.
   X-ray diffraction shows these hybrid materials to be crystalline. In the
   case of ZIF-8-90 hybrids, the cubic space group of the parent frameworks
   is continuously maintained, whereas in the case of the ZIF-7-8 hybrids
   there is a transition from a cubic to a rhombohedral space group.
   Nitrogen physisorption data reveal that the hybrid materials exhibit
   substantial changes in gate-opening phenomena, either occurring at
   continuously tunable partial pressures of nitrogen (ZIF-8-90 hybrids) or
   loss of gate-opening effects to yield more rigid frameworks (ZIF-7-8
   hybrids). With this synthetic approach, significant alterations in MOF
   properties may be realized to suit a desired separation or catalytic
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, many modifications have been proposed in simulated
   moving bed (SMB) chromatography in order to effectively separate a
   binary mixture. However, the separation of multicomponent mixtures using
   SMB is still one of the major challenges. In addition, the performance
   of SMB system highly depends on its operating conditions. Our study
   address this issue by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem
   that maximizes the productivity and purity of intermediate eluting
   component at the same time. A number of optimized isocractic ternary SMB
   operating schemes are compared both in terms of productivity and amount
   of desorbent to feed ratio. Furthermore, we propose a generalized full
   cycle (GFC) formulation based on superstructure formulation encompassing
   numerous operating schemes proposed in the literature. We also
   demonstrate that this approach has a potential to find the best ternary
   separation strategy among various alternatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The interaction of Rh-n (n = 1-5) clusters with nonhydrated
   gamma-Al2O3(100), hydrated gamma-Al2O3(100), and hydrated
   gamma-Al2O3(110) surfaces has been investigated using density functional
   theory methods. On these surfaces, Rh-3 prefers a triangular geometry,
   while Rh-4 and Rhs adopt 3D structures. On the (100) surfaces, Rh,,
   binds considerably more strongly on the nonhydrated surface than on the
   hydrated surface. On the hydrated (110) surface, Rh binds to surface
   hydroxyl groups, which is consistent with experimental observations.
   Characterizing the structure of Rh clusters makes it possible to
   identify the critical cluster size for nucleation on each surface.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a new approach to develop transferable force fields
   describing molecular adsorption in zeolites by combining
   dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and
   classical atomigtic simulations. This approach is illustrated with the
   adsorption of CO2 in zeolites. Multiple dispersion-corrected DFT methods
   were tested for describing CO2 adsorption in sodium-exchanged
   ferrierite. The DFT-D2 approach was found to give the best agreement
   with high level quantum chemistry results and experimental data. A
   classical force field for CO2 adsorption in siliceous zeolites was then
   developed on the basis of hundreds of DFT-D2 calculations that probed
   the full range of accessible volume in purely siliceous chabazite
   (Si-CHA) via random sampling. We independently performed experiments
   with Si-CHA measuring CO2 isotherms and heats of adsorption by
   microcalorimetry. Excellent agreement was obtained between adsorption
   isotherms predicted with our first-principles-derived force field and
   our experiments. The transferability of this force field was examined
   using available adsorption isotherms for CO2 in siliceous MFI and DDR
   zeolites, again with reasonably good agreement between calculated and
   experimental results. The methods demonstrated by these calculations
   will be broadly applicable in using molecular simulations to predict
   properties of adsorbed molecules in zeolites and other nanoporous
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Sequencing of microbial community RNA (metatranscriptome) is a useful
   approach for assessing gene expression in microorganisms from the
   natural environment. This method has revealed transcriptional patterns
   in situ, but can also be used to detect transcriptional cascades in
   microcosms following experimental perturbation. Unambiguously
   identifying differential transcription between control and experimental
   treatments requires constraining effects that are simply due to sampling
   and bottle enclosure. These effects remain largely uncharacterized for
   ``challenging{''} microbial samples, such as those from anoxic regions
   that require special handling to maintain in situ conditions. Here, we
   demonstrate substantial changes in microbial transcription induced by
   sample collection and incubation in experimental bioreactors. Microbial
   communities were sampled from the water column of a marine oxygen
   minimum zone by a pump system that introduced minimal oxygen
   contamination and subsequently incubated in bioreactors under near in
   situ oxygen and temperature conditions. Relative to the source water,
   experimental samples became dominated by transcripts suggestive of cell
   stress, including chaperone, protease, and RNA degradation genes from
   diverse taxa, with strong representation from SAR11-like
   alphaproteobacteria. In tandem, transcripts matching facultative
   anaerobic gammaproteobacteria of the Alteromonadales (e. g., Colwellia)
   increased 4-13 fold up to 43\% of coding transcripts, and encoded a
   diverse gene set suggestive of protein synthesis and cell growth. We
   interpret these patterns as taxon-specific responses to combined
   environmental changes in the bioreactors, including shifts in substrate
   or oxygen availability, and minor temperature and pressure changes
   during sampling with the pump system. Whether such changes confound
   analysis of transcriptional patterns may vary based on the design of the
   experiment, the taxonomic composition of the source community, and on
   the metabolic linkages between community members. These data highlight
   the impressive capacity for transcriptional changes within complex
   microbial communities, underscoring the need for caution when inferring
   in situ metabolism based on transcript abundances in experimental
   incubations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at understanding the interaction of intrinsic conducting
   polymer. PEDT, with ALD-deposited Al2O3 and thermally oxidized Ta2O5
   dielectrics, and the underlying mechanisms for increase in leakage
   currents in PEDT-based capacitors. Conducting polymers offer several
   advantages as electrodes for high surface area capacitors because of
   their lower resistance, self-healing and enhanced conformality. However,
   capacitors with in situ polymerized PEDT show poor electrical properties
   that are attributed to the interfacial interaction between the organic
   electrode and the oxide dielectric. This study focuses on characterizing
   these interactions. A combination of compositional, structural and
   electrical characterization techniques was applied to
   polymer-solid-state-capacitor to understand the interfacial chemical
   behavior and dielectric property deterioration of alumina and
   tantalum-oxide films. XPS and impedance studies were employed to
   understand the stiochiometric and compositional changes that occur in
   the dielectric film on interaction with in situ deposited PEDT. Based on
   the observations from several complimentary techniques, it is concluded
   that tantalum-pentoxide has more resistance towards chemical interaction
   with in situ polymerized PEDT. The thermally oxidized Ta2O5-PEDT system
   showed leakage current of 280 nA mu F-1 at 3 V with a breakdown voltage
   of 30V. On the other hand, Al2O3-PEDT capacitor showed leakage current
   of 50 mu A mu F-1 and a breakdown voltage of 40 V. The study reports
   direct evidence for the mechanism of resistivity drop in alumina
   dielectric with in situ polymerized PEDT electrode. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Stimulus-evoked high frequency oscillations are present in neuronal
   networks on microelectrode arrays}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Pathological high frequency oscillations (250-600 Hz) are present in the
   brains of epileptic animals and humans. The etiology of these
   oscillations and how they contribute to the diseased state remains
   unclear. This work identifies the presence of microstimulation-evoked
   high frequency oscillations (250-400 Hz) in dissociated neuronal
   networks cultured on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Oscillations are more
   apparent with higher stimulus voltages. As with in vivo studies,
   activity is isolated to a single electrode, however, the MEA provides
   improved spatial resolution with no spread of the oscillation to
   adjacent electrodes 200 mu m away. Oscillations develop across four
   weeks in vitro. Oscillations still occur in the presence of tetrodotoxin
   and synaptic blockers, and they cause no apparent disruption in the
   ability of oscillation-presenting electrodes to elicit directly evoked
   action potentials (dAPs) or promote the spread of synaptic activity
   throughout the culture. Chelating calcium with ethylene glycol
   tetraacetic acid (EGTA) causes a temporal prolongation of the
   oscillation. Finally, carbenoxolone significantly reduces or eliminates
   the high frequency oscillations. Gap junctions may play a significant
   role in maintaining the oscillation given the inhibitory effect of
   carbenoxolone, the propagating effect of reduced calcium conditions and
   the isolated nature of the activity as demonstrated in previous studies.

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic hybrid (mixed matrix) membranes can potentially extend
   the separation performance of traditional polymeric materials while
   maintaining processing convenience. Although many dense films studies
   have been reported, there have been few reported cases of these
   materials being successfully extended to asymmetric hollow fibers. In
   this work we report the first successful production of mixed matrix
   asymmetric hollow fiber membranes containing metal-organic-framework
   (MOF) ZIF-8 fillers. Specifically, we have incorporated ZIF-8 into a
   polyetherimide (Ultem((R)) 1000) matrix and produced dual-layer
   asymmetric hollow fiber membranes via the dry jet-wet quench method. The
   outer separating layer of these composite fibers contains 13 wt\% (17
   vol\%) of ZIF-8 filler. These membranes have been tested over a range of
   temperatures and pressures for a variety of gas pairs. An increase in
   separation performance for the CO2/N-2 gas pairs was observed for both
   pure gas and mixed gas feeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Effect of thermal annealing on a novel polyamide-imide polymer membrane
   for aggressive acid gas separations}},

Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{163-174}},

Abstract = {{A fluorinated, 6FDA based polyamide-imide is investigated for the
   purification of CH4 from CO2 and H2S containing gas streams. Dense
   polymer films were thermally annealed and showed that increased
   annealing temperatures at constant annealing time caused transport
   behavior that does not resemble physical aging. Free volume increased
   after annealing at 200 degrees C for 24 h relative to annealing at 150
   degrees C for the same time. CO2 and CH4 permeabilities and
   diffusivities did not decrease as a result of the higher annealing
   temperature, and in fact, were shown to increase slightly. A change to
   the intrinsic microstructure that cannot be described by simple,
   densification based physical aging is hypothesized to be the reason for
   this trend. Furthermore, annealing increased CO2 induced plasticization
   resistance and a temperature of 200 degrees C was shown to have the
   greatest effect on plasticization suppression. Annealing at 200 degrees
   C for 24 h suppressed pure gas CO2 plasticization up to 450 psia.
   Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed increased intramolecular charge
   transfer, which is presumably due to increased electron conjugation over
   the N-phenyl bond. Additionally, intermolecular charge transfer
   increased with thermal annealing, as inferred from fluorescence
   intensity measurements and XRD patterns. 50/50 CO2/CH4 mixed gas
   permeation measurements reveal stable separation performance up to 1000
   psia. Ternary mixed gas feeds containing toluene/CO2/CH4 and H2S/CO2/CH4
   show antiplasticization, but more importantly, selectivity losses due to
   plasticization did not occur up to 900 psia of total feed pressure.
   These results show that the polyamide-imide family represents a
   promising class of separation materials for aggressive acid gas
   purifications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New tools for analysis of oscillatory networks using phase response
   theory (PRT) under the assumption of pulsatile coupling have been
   developed steadily since the 1980s, but none have yet allowed for
   analysis of mixed systems containing nonoscillatory elements. This
   caveat has excluded the application of PRT to most real systems, which
   are often mixed. We show that a recently developed tool, the functional
   phase resetting curve (fPRC), provides a serendipitous benefit: it
   allows incorporation of nonoscillatory elements into systems of
   oscillators where PRT can be applied. We validate this method in a model
   system of neural oscillators and a biological system, the pyloric
   network of crustacean decapods.}},

Abstract = {{Limited knowledge exists regarding the forces which act on devices
   implanted to the heart's mitral valve. Developing a transducer to
   measure the peak force magnitudes, time rates of change, and
   relationship with left ventricular pressure will aid in device
   development. A novel force transducer was developed and implanted in the
   mitral valve annulus of an ovine subject. In the post-cardioplegic
   heart, septal-lateral and transverse forces were continuously measured
   for cardiac cycles reaching a peak left ventricular pressure of 90 mmHg.
   Each force was seen to increase from ventricular diastole and found to
   peak at mid-systole. The mean change in septal-lateral and transverse
   forces throughout the cardiac cycle was 4.4 +/- 0.2 N and 1.9 +/- 0.1 N
   respectively. During isovolumetric contraction, the septal-lateral and
   transverse forces were found to increase at peak rate of 143 +/- 8 N/s
   and 34 +/- 9 N/s, respectively. Combined, this study provides the first
   quantitative assessment of septal-lateral and transverse forces within
   the contractile mitral annulus. The developed transducer was successful
   in measuring these forces whose methods may be extended to future
   studies. Upon additional investigation, these data may contribute to the
   safer development and evaluation of devices aimed to repair or replace
   mitral valve function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nociception generally evokes rapid withdrawal behavior in
   order to protect the tissue from harmful insults. Most nociceptive
   neurons responding to mechanical insults display highly branched
   dendrites, an anatomy shared by Caenorhabditis elegans FLP and PVD
   neurons, which mediate harsh touch responses. Although several primary
   molecular nociceptive sensors have been characterized, less is known
   about modulation and amplification of noxious signals within nociceptor
   neurons. First, we analyzed the FLP/PVD network by optogenetics and
   studied integration of signals from these cells in downstream
   interneurons. Second, we investigated which genes modulate PVD function,
   based on prior single-neuron mRNA profiling of PVD.
   Results: Selectively photoactivating PVD, FLP, and downstream
   interneurons via Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) enabled the functional
   dissection of this nociceptive network, without interfering signals by
   other mechanoreceptors. Forward or reverse escape behaviors were
   determined by PVD and FLP, via integration by command interneurons. To
   identify mediators of PVD function, acting downstream of primary
   nocisensor molecules, we knocked down PVD-specific transcripts by RNAi
   and quantified light-evoked PVD-dependent behavior. Cell-specific
   disruption of synaptobrevin or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs)
   showed that PVD signals chemically to command interneurons. Knocking
   down the DEG/ENaC channel ASIC-1 and the TRPM channel GTL-1 indicated
   that ASIC-1 may extend PVD's dynamic range and that GTL-1 may amplify
   its signals. These channels act cell autonomously in PVD, downstream of
   primary mechanosensory molecules.
   Conclusions: Our work implicates TRPM channels in modifying excitability
   of and DEG/ENaCs in potentiating signal output from a mechano-nociceptor
   neuron. ASIC-1 and GTL-1 homologs, if functionally conserved, may denote
   valid targets for novel analgesics.}},

Abstract = {{Applied forces and the biophysical nature of the cellular
   microenvironment play a central role in determining cellular behavior.
   Specifically, forces due to cell contraction are transmitted into
   structural ECM proteins and these forces are presumed to activate
   integrin ``switches.{''} The mechanism of such switches is thought to be
   the partial unfolding of integrin-binding domains within fibronectin
   (Fn). However, integrin switches remain largely hypothetical due to a
   dearth of evidence for their existence, and relevance, in vivo. By using
   phage display in combination with the controlled deposition and
   extension of Fn fibers, we report the discovery of peptide-based
   molecular probes capable of selectively discriminating Fn fibers under
   different strain states. Importantly, we show that the probes are
   functional in both in vitro and ex vivo tissue contexts. The development
   of such tools represents a critical step in establishing the relevance
   of theoretical mechanotransduction events within the cellular
   microenvironment.}},

Title = {{Toughening and Asymmetry in Peeling of Heterogeneous Adhesives}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{The effective adhesive properties of heterogeneous thin films are
   characterized through a combined experimental and theoretical
   investigation. By bridging scales, we show how variations of elastic or
   adhesive properties at the microscale can significantly affect the
   effective peeling behavior of the adhesive at the macroscale. Our study
   reveals three elementary mechanisms in heterogeneous systems involving
   front propagation: (i) patterning the elastic bending stiffness of the
   film produces fluctuations of the driving force resulting in
   dramatically enhanced resistance to peeling; (ii) optimized arrangements
   of pinning sites with large adhesion energy are shown to control the
   effective system resistance, allowing the design of highly anisotropic
   and asymmetric adhesives; (iii) heterogeneities of both types result in
   front motion instabilities producing sudden energy releases that
   increase the overall adhesion energy. These findings open potentially
   new avenues for the design of thin films with improved adhesion
   properties, and motivate new investigations of other phenomena involving
   front propagation.}},

Title = {{Cargo distributions differentiate pathological axonal transport
   impairments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{300}},
Pages = {{277-291}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Axonal transport is an essential process in neurons, analogous to
   shipping goods, by which energetic and cellular building supplies are
   carried downstream (anterogradely) and wastes are carried upstream
   (retrogradely) by molecular motors, which act as cargo porters.
   Impairments in axonal transport have been linked to devastating and
   often lethal neurodegenerative diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral
   Sclerosis, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's. Axonal transport impairment
   types include a decrease in available motors for cargo transport (motor
   depletion), the presence of defective or non-functional motors (motor
   dilution), and the presence of increased or larger cargos (protein
   aggregation). An impediment to potential treatment identification has
   been the inability to determine what type(s) of axonal transport
   impairment candidates that could be present in a given disease. In this
   study, we utilize a computational model and common axonal transport
   experimental metrics to reveal the axonal transport impairment general
   characteristics or ``signatures{''} that result from three general
   defect types of motor depletion, motor dilution, and protein
   aggregation. Our results not only provide a means to discern these
   general impairments types, they also reveal key dynamic and emergent
   features of axonal transport, which potentially underlie multiple
   impairment types. The identified characteristics, as well as the
   analytical method, can be used to help elucidate the axonal transport
   impairments observed in experimental and clinical data. For example,
   using the model-predicted defect signatures, we identify the defect
   candidates, which are most likely to be responsible for the axonal
   transport impairments in the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS. (C) 2012

Title = {{Importance of composition and hygroscopicity of BC particles to the
   effect of BC mitigation on cloud properties: Application to California
   conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) has many effects on climate including the direct
   effect on atmospheric absorption, indirect and semi-direct effects on
   clouds, snow effects, and others. While most of these are positive
   (warming), the first indirect effect is negative and quantifying its
   magnitude in addition to other BC feedbacks is important for supporting
   policies that mitigate BC. We use the detailed aerosol chemistry parcel
   model of Russell and Seinfeld (1998), observationally constrained by
   initial measured aerosol concentrations from five California sites, to
   provide simulated cloud drop number (CDN) concentrations against which
   two GCM calculations - one run at the global scale and one nested from
   the global-to-regional scale are compared. The GCM results reflect the
   combined effects of their emission inventories, advection schemes, and
   cloud parameterizations. BC-type particles contributed between 16 and
   20\% of cloud droplets at all sites even in the presence of more
   hygroscopic particles. While this chemically detailed parcel model
   result is based on simplified cloud dynamics and does not consider
   semi-direct or cloud absorption effects, the cloud drop number
   concentrations are similar to the simulations of both Chen et al.
   (2010b) and Jacobson (2010) for the average cloud conditions in
   California. Reducing BC particle concentration by 50\% decreased the
   cloud droplet concentration by between 6\% and 9\% resulting in the
   formation of fewer, larger cloud droplets that correspond to a lower
   cloud albedo. This trend is similar to Chen et al. (2010b) and Jacobson
   (2010) when BC particles were modeled as hygroscopic. This reduction in
   CDN in California due to the decrease in activated BC particles supports
   the concern raised by Chen et al. (2010a) that the cloud albedo effect
   of BC particles has a cooling effect that partially offsets the direct
   forcing reduction if other warming effects of BC on clouds are
   unchanged. These results suggests that for regions like the California
   sites studied here, where BC mitigation targets fossil fuel sources, a
   critical aspect of the modeled reduction is the chemical composition and
   associated hygroscopicity of the BC particles removed as well as their
   relative contribution to the atmospheric particle concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale experimental study of the structural, compositional, and
   morphological characteristics of aluminosilicate (LTA) and pure-silica
   (MFI) zeolite materials surface-modified with MgOxHy nanostructures is
   presented. These characteristics are correlated with the suitability of
   such materials in the fabrication of LTA/Matrimid mixed-matrix
   membranes; (MMMs) for CO2/CH4 separations. The four functionalization
   methods studied in this work produce surface nanostructures that may
   appear superficially similar under SEM observation but in fact differ
   considerably in shape, size, surface coverage, surface area/roughness,
   degree of attachment to the zeolite surface, and degree of zeolite pore
   blocking. The evaluation of these characteristics by a combination of
   TEM, HRTEM, N-2 physisorption, multiscale compositional analysis (XPS,
   EDX, and ICP-AES elemental analysis), and diffraction (ED and XRD)
   allows improved understanding of the origin of disparate gas permeation
   properties observed in MMMs made with four types of surface-modified
   zeolite LTA materials, as well as a rational selection of the method
   expected to result in the best enhancement of the desired properties (in
   the present case, CO2/CH4 selectivity increase without sacrificing
   permeability). A method based on ion exchange of the LTA with Mg2+,
   followed by base-induced precipitation and growth of MgOxHy
   nanostructures, deemed ``ion exchange functionalization{''} here, offers
   modified particles with the best overall characteristics resulting in
   the most effective MMMs. LTA/Matrimid MMMs containing ion exchange
   functionalized particles had a considerably higher CO2/CH4 selectivity
   (similar to 40) than could be obtained with the other functionalization
   techniques (similar to 30), while maintaining a CO2 permeability of
   similar to 10 barrers. A parallel study on pure silica MFI surface
   nanostructures is also presented to compare and contrast with the
   zeolite LTA case.}},

Abstract = {{The MOF Mg/DOBDC has one of the highest known CO2 adsorption capacities
   at the low to moderate CO2 partial pressures relevant for CO2 capture
   from flue gas but is difficult to regenerate for use in cyclic
   operation. In this work, Mg/DOBDC is modified by functionalization of
   its open metal coordination sites with, ethylene diamine (ED) to
   introduce pendent amines into the MOP micropores. DFT calculations and
   experimental nitrogen physisorption and thermogravimetric analysis
   suggest that 1 ED molecule is added to each unit cell, on average. This
   modification both increases the material's CO2 adsorption capacity at
   ultradilute CO2 partial pressures and increases the regenerability of
   the material, allowing for cyclic adsorption-desorption cycles with
   identical adsorption capacities. This is one of the first MOF materials
   demonstrated to yield significant adsorption capacities from simulated
   ambient air (400 ppm CO2), and its capacity is competitive with the
   best-known adsorbents based on amine-oxide composites.}},

Abstract = {{Many existing pile-supported marginal wharves within ports along the
   West Coast of the United States were designed in the late 1960s and
   early 1970s using the seismic design criteria available then, which were
   much less robust than the current criteria. As a result, structures
   designed using these criteria have often been severely damaged during
   the past earthquakes. This paper investigates the modal properties and
   vulnerability of such structures by using advanced structural and soil
   modeling procedures to perform two-dimensional nonlinear plane-strain
   seismic analyses using time histories of ground displacement and excess
   pore water pressures within the underlying soil embankment. Results show
   that the wharf structure experiences large permanent deformations and
   undergoes failure of the piles and pile-deck connections and pullout of
   batter piles in tension under large seismic events. Such failures were
   observed at the Port of Oakland during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake
   and also during other earthquakes throughout the world. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Recovery and recycling of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) size from desize
   effluent streams by ultrafiltration (UF) is more than 35-years old, but

   size recovery and recycling is needed that can reduce energy and water

   disadvantages of the current UF process. In this study, VFE technology
   was investigated in the recovery and recycling of single-component PVA
   size. Cotton towel yarns (both pile and ground) slashed with PVA size
   recovered by VFE maintained projected weaving properties. No added wax
   was needed in the recycled size slashing formulations.}},

Title = {{The Chimeric Genome of Sphaerochaeta: Nonspiral Spirochetes That Break
   with the Prevalent Dogma in Spirochete Biology}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Spirochaetes is one of a few bacterial phyla that are characterized by a
   unifying diagnostic feature, namely, the helical morphology and motility
   conferred by axial periplasmic flagella. Their unique morphology and
   mode of propulsion also represent major pathogenicity factors of
   clinical spirochetes. Here we describe the genome sequences of two
   coccoid isolates of the recently described genus Sphaerochaeta which are
   members of the phylum Spirochaetes based on 16S rRNA gene and
   whole-genome phylogenies. Interestingly, the Sphaerochaeta genomes
   completely lack the motility and associated signal transduction genes
   present in all sequenced spirochete genomes. Additional analyses
   revealed that the lack of flagella is associated with a unique, nonrigid
   cell wall structure hallmarked by a lack of transpeptidase and
   transglycosylase genes, which is also unprecedented in spirochetes. The
   Sphaerochaeta genomes are highly enriched in fermentation and
   carbohydrate metabolism genes relative to other spirochetes, indicating
   a fermentative lifestyle. Remarkably, most of the enriched genes appear
   to have been acquired from nonspirochetes, particularly clostridia, in
   several massive horizontal gene transfer events (>40\% of the total
   number of genes in each genome). Such a high level of direct interphylum
   genetic exchange is extremely rare among mesophilic organisms and has
   important implications for the assembly of the prokaryotic tree of life.
   IMPORTANCE Spiral shape and motility historically have been the unifying
   hallmarks of the phylum Spirochaetes. These features also represent
   important virulence factors of highly invasive pathogenic spirochetes
   such as the causative agents of syphilis and Lyme disease. Through the
   integration of genome sequencing, microscopy, and physiological studies,
   we conclusively show that the spiral morphology and motility of
   spirochetes are not universal morphological properties. In particular,
   we found that the genomes of the members of the recently described genus
   Sphaerochaeta lack the genes encoding the characteristic flagellar
   apparatus and, in contrast to most other spirochetes, have acquired many
   metabolic and fermentation genes from clostridia. These findings have
   major implications for the isolation and study of spirochetes, the
   diagnosis of spirochete-caused diseases, and the reconstruction of the
   evolutionary history of this important bacterial phylum. The
   Sphaerochaeta sp. genomes offer new avenues to link ecophysiology with
   the functionality and evolution of the spirochete flagellar apparatus.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper presents a rigorous approach that can accurately and
   efficiently capture the linear, static and free-vibration behaviors of a
   beam-like structure by the rigorous combination of a one-dimensional
   beam model with a three-dimensional continuum model. This study focuses
   on coupling these disparate finite element types, putting them both into
   a single finite element model while making use of the asymptotically
   exact information available as part of the beam model, which itself is
   obtained by asymptotic dimensional reduction. The coupling is undertaken
   by use of appropriate transformation matrices at the interface together
   with stress and displacement recovery relations that are part of the
   beam theory. Results obtained from the so-called joined model{''} are
   compared with those from a finely meshed model using three-dimensional
   brick elements. It is demonstrated that the present approach provides
   accurate solutions for effects previously available only from
   three-dimensional models. However, because the joined model uses far
   fewer elements than a full three-dimensional model, the joined model is
   more efficient.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains how value-driven design provides a framework to
   enhance the systems engineering processes for the design of large
   systems. It goes On to show that by employing economics in

   level of engineering design. This paper demonstrates the application of
   value-driven design to an aircraft propulsion system through two case
   studies, which were conducted through workshops within Rolls-Royce.

Abstract = {{Metropolitan areas with high traffic demand are often served by a system
   of two or more airports whose arrival and departure operations are
   highly interdependent. Such an airport system is referred to as a
   metroplex. A temporal-spatial framework for evaluating concepts for
   improving metroplex operations was developed. In this framework,
   concepts for metroplex operations were defined by their spatial and
   temporal impacts on operations. These impacts were evaluated
   parametrically with a generic metroplex model. The experiment revealed
   that temporal scheduling and route segregation are the two most
   important integrated concepts for reducing delays in the terminal area
   airspace. These two concepts were then incorporated to form an
   experiment matrix, and their effects were tested in a metroplex model
   based on the New York terminal area airspace. Simulation analyses showed
   a nearly 80\% reduction in queueing delay for arrival flights when the
   scheduling and route structural design were combined and more than 60\%
   reduction with scheduling alone.}},

Title = {{Statistical Determination of Vertical Resolution Requirements for

Abstract = {{Wake-vortex interaction is one of the primary drivers for aircraft
   separation minimums. Real-time wake-vortex prediction algorithms could
   enable following distances to be reduced, improving the efficiency of
   the air transport system. This study uses statistical analysis to
   determine the necessary vertical resolution of meteorological parameters
   required to enable real-time wake-vortex models to predict wake-vortex
   position and strength using two separate analyses. The first analysis
   sought to characterize the accuracy of the predictions of real-time
   wake-vortex models for 1 m (highest) and 100 m (lowest) resolution by
   comparing the predictions to measured wake vortices. Using NASA's AVOSS
   Prediction Algorithm Suite v4.19 and two data sets collected at Memphis
   and Dallas-Fort Worth, the results indicate that the range of vortex
   circulation root-mean-square (RMS) error is {[}1.5-32.6] m(2)/s, the
   range of vortex Y-position RMS error is {[}0.7-134.5] in, and the range
   of vortex Z-position error is {[}1.2-10.1] m. The Y-position error had
   the largest variation with the maximum deviation exceeding 25 m. The
   second analysis sought to characterize the precision of the real-time
   wake-vortex model predictions as the resolution of the input
   meteorological files was reduced from 1 m to 100 m. Normalized RMS
   values (by 1 m resolution) were calculated for resolutions of 5, 15, 20,
   25, 30, 40, and 100 in averaged over the first 60 s of data available.
   For predicted circulation, differences were found between medians at
   input resolutions 5-20 m vs 25-100 m; for V- and Z-position, differences
   were found between medians 100 m and all others.}},

Abstract = {{The variational-asymptotic method is a powerful mathematical method to
   construct asymptotically correct models of dimensionally reducible
   structures. Variational asymptotic method is used to rigorously split a
   general three-dimensional nonlinear elasticity problem into a
   two-dimensional linear cross-sectional analysis and a one-dimensional
   nonlinear beam analysis. This operation results in the replacement of a
   three-dimensional model with a reduced-order model in terms of an
   asymptotic series of certain small parameters inherent to the structure.
   Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS) is an engineering
   software package that uses the variational asymptotic method to perform
   a generalized cross-sectional modeling of any initially twisted and
   curved anisotropic beam having arbitrary cross-sectional geometry, with
   transverse shear and Vlasov refinements. Several new cases of
   verification are presented. The capability of VABS to recover pointwise
   three-dimensional stress fields is demonstrated for an orthotropic
   cantilever and verified against known solutions from anisotropic
   elasticity theory. Next, a form of verification is proposed for beams
   with either initial twist or curvature by using two different modeling
   approaches: one based on curvilinear coordinates and the other on
   Cartesian coordinates for initially twisted beams or piecewise-Cartesian
   coordinates for initially curved beams. Excellent correlation of results
   between the two approaches indicates the correct modeling of effects of
   initial curvature and twist in both cross-sectional and global beam
   analyses. Further, a numerical verification of results for initially
   twisted and/or curved beams is provided by comparing values of
   one-dimensional variables extracted from three-dimensional finite
   element analyses with results from a one-dimensional, nonlinear beam
   analysis (using cross-sectional constants from VABS). Finally, numerical
   examples are shown to highlight the importance of including curvature
   measures in the cross-sectional modeling by comparing with finite
   element results.}},

Abstract = {{Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool
   for researching the role of blood flow in disease processes. Modern
   clinical imaging technology such as MRI and CT can provide high
   resolution information about vessel geometry, but in many situations,
   patient-specific inlet velocity information is not available. In these
   situations, a simplified velocity profile must be selected. We studied
   how idealized inlet velocity profiles (blunt, parabolic, and Womersley
   flow) affect patient-specific CFD results when compared to simulations
   employing a ``reference standard{''} of the patient's own measured
   velocity profile in the carotid bifurcation. To place the magnitude of
   these effects in context, we also investigated the effect of geometry
   and the use of subject-specific flow waveform on the CFD results. We
   quantified these differences by examining the pointwise percent error of
   the mean wall shear stress (WSS) and the oscillatory shear index (OSI)
   and by computing the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between
   axial profiles of the mean WSS and OSI in the internal carotid artery
   bulb. The parabolic inlet velocity profile produced the most similar
   mean WSS and OSI to simulations employing the real patient-specific
   inlet velocity profile. However, anatomic variation in vessel geometry
   and the use of a nonpatient-specific flow waveform both affected the WSS
   and OSI results more than did the choice of inlet velocity profile.
   Although careful selection of boundary conditions is essential for all
   CFD analysis, accurate patient-specific geometry reconstruction and
   measurement of vessel flow rate waveform are more important than the
   choice of velocity profile. A parabolic velocity profile provided
   results most similar to the patient-specific velocity profile. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The future design and development efforts of supersonic inflatable
   aerodynamic decelerators will rely heavily on computational analyses to
   accurately assess performance characteristics. Work was performed in
   validating multiple computational fluid dynamics codes for analysis of a
   supersonic tension-cone inflatable aerodynamic decelerator. Inviscid
   axisymmetric solutions were computed and matched measured forebody
   pressure distributions, whereas predicted aftbody pressures exhibited
   variability. Calculated drag coefficients were within 5\% of the total
   drag. Inviscid analysis accurately predicted the shock curvature and
   location. Viscous analyses performed using an overset grid topology
   demonstrated close agreement in calculated surface pressures, including
   aftbody pressures, at Mach numbers up to 3.0 and angles of attack up to
   20 deg. Accurate predictions of aerodynamic performance at Mach numbers
   above 3.5 required a shock-aligned grid to eliminate errors introduced
   as a result of shock-staircasing. Using the shock-aligned grids, it was
   determined that at higher Mach number and higher angle of attack the
   leeward region of the tension cone likely transitions to a turbulent
   boundary layer, ensuring that the flow remained attached through a
   strong adverse pressure gradient. An investigation of aerodynamic
   performance in a Martian environment showed small increases in
   forebody-only axial force and minor decreases in static stability.}},

   subfamily to be identified. Little is known about the cellular
   distribution of PlexinA4 in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion
   (DRG). Here, immunohistochemical studies using antibodies to PlexinA4
   revealed immunolabeling in neurons in both dorsal and, to a greater
   extent, ventral horns of the spinal cord. Ventral horn PlexinA4 positive
   neurons exhibited morphology, size, and location consistent with both
   motor neurons and interneurons. Labeling was found in motor axons
   exiting through the ventral roots, and more widespread labeling was
   observed in ascending and descending white matter tracts. Within the
   DRG, immunostaining was observed in neuronal cell bodies as well as the
   central and peripheral processes of these cells. PlexinA4 is expressed
   in the peripheral nervous system where its expression is regulated upon
   nerve injury. This is the first detailed description of the cellular and
   subcellular distribution of PlexinA4 in the adult spinal cord and DRG,
   and it will set the basis for future studies on the potential role of
   PlexinA4 in regeneration and repair of the adult central and peripheral

Abstract = {{The molecular-beam spectrometric technique coupled with tunable
   synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization is applied to reveal the
   catalytic decomposition of methane over Ni-based composites with and
   without impregnated nano-sized samaria-doped ceria (SDC) particles. It
   is shown that the coating of SDC nanoparticles not only decreases the
   decomposition temperature, but also increases the conversion ratio, thus
   indicating that those impregnated SDC nanoparticles are highly
   catalytically active for methane decomposition. In addition, C2H4 is
   observed when the impregnated Ni-SDC composites are used as the
   catalyst, suggesting that SDC coating also suppresses carbon deposition
   at the anodes of solid oxide fuel cells. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Mixed ionic-electronic conductors in the family of
   LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-delta (LSCF) have been widely studied as cathode
   materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the long-term
   stability and the limited surface catalytic activity are still a
   concern. Here we report a new catalyst La0.4875Ca0.0125Ce0.5O2-delta
   (LCC), which can significantly enhance the performance and stability of
   LSCF cathodes when applied as a thin-film coating on LSCF surface. For
   example, with 5 mu L 0.25 mol L-1 LCC solution infiltrated into LSCF
   cathode, the cathodic polarization resistance was reduced by similar to
   60\% (to similar to 0.076 Omega cm(2)) at 750 degrees C, leading to a
   peak power density of similar to 1.25 W/cm(2), which is similar to 18\%
   higher than that for the unmodified LSCF cathode in an anode-supported
   cell. In addition, stable power output was observed for over 500 h
   operation at 750 degrees C under a constant voltage of 0.7 V. Copyright

Abstract = {{A sealant-free solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) micro-stack was successfully
   operated inside a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) flame during cooking.
   This micro-stack consisted of 4 single cells with infiltrated
   La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) based composite anodes, achieving
   an open circuit voltage of 0.92 V and a peak power density of 348 mW
   cm(-2). This performance is significantly better than that of stack with
   its cathode operation outside flame. The results confirmed that the
   perovskite oxide anode showed good properties of carbon-free,
   redox-stability, quick-start (less than 1 min) and successful operation
   under a wide range of oxygen partial pressure. For comparison, the
   conventional Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode was prepared
   and tested under the same conditions, showing an open circuit voltage of
   0.915 V and a peak power density of 366 mW cm(-2), but obvious carbon
   deposition, poor stability and slow/difficult-start. The direct flame
   SOFC (DFFC) with a new configuration and design has a potential for
   combined heat and power generation for many applications. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Conformally coating vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (v-CNT) with
   metals or oxides can be difficult because standard line-of-sight
   deposition methods, such as dc sputter coating and electron-beam
   evaporation, are hindered by the low mean-free-path within the
   vertically aligned array. In this work, we present a facile method to
   conformally coat dense arrays of v-CNTs using thermal decomposition of
   iron pentacarbonyl at 205 degrees C and 30 mTorr. The resulting coatings
   were found to be uniform from top-to-bottom across an entire 1 x 1 cm(2)
   array of v-CNTs. The thickness of the deposited coating was found to be
   2-3 nm/cycle and the resulting film thickness were found to be 13 +/- 3
   nm after five cycles and 55 +/- 5 nm after 20 cycles. This process
   demonstrates that metal organic chemical vapor deposition can be used to
   fabricate conformal coatings on v-CNTs. (C) 2012 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Fluorination of graphene has emerged as an attractive approach toward

   difluoride gas. Incorporation of fluorine moieties on graphene after SF6
   plasma-treatment was confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   Modifications in the valence band states of graphene after
   plasma-treatment were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron
   spectroscopy. Increase in work function of plasma-treated graphene
   demonstrates the ability of plasma-assisted fluorination to modify the
   electron emission characteristics of graphene. Raman spectroscopy
   reveals that the majority of carbon atoms in graphene retain their sp(2)

Abstract = {{We use modeling and simulations guided by initial experiments to study

   We find good agreement between the inviscid model and the experiment in
   the foil motions (particularly the wavelengths of their shapes), the
   dependences of their swimming speeds on foil length and rigidity, and
   the corresponding flows. The model predicts that the foil speed is

   2/15 power. These scalings give a good collapse of the experimental

Abstract = {{An acoustic field generated by a light-weight, low-power acoustic driver
   is shown to increase the critical heat flux during pool boiling by about
   17\%. It does this by facilitating the removal of vapor bubbles from the
   heated surface and suppressing the instability that leads to the
   transition to film boiling at the critical heat flux. Bubble removal is
   enhanced because the acoustic field induces capillary waves on the
   surface of a vapor bubble that interact with the bubble contact line on
   the heated surface causing the contact line to contract and detach the
   bubble from the surface. The acoustic field also produces a radiation
   pressure that helps to facilitate the bubble detachment process and also
   suppresses the transition to film boiling. The mechanisms associated
   with these interactions are explored using three different experimental
   setups with acoustic forcing: an air bubble on the underside of a
   horizontal surface, a single vapor bubble on the top side of a
   horizontal heated surface, and pool boiling from a horizontal heated
   surface. Measurements of the capillary waves induced on the bubbles,
   bubble motion, and heat transfer from the heated surface were performed
   to isolate and identify the dominant forces involved in these
   acoustically forced motions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Histone H1 Depletion Impairs Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are known to possess a
   relatively open chromatin structure; yet, despite efforts to
   characterize the chromatin signatures of ESCs, the role of chromatin
   compaction in stem cell fate and function remains elusive. Linker
   histone H1 is important for higher-order chromatin folding and is
   essential for mammalian embryogenesis. To investigate the role of H1 and
   chromatin compaction in stem cell pluripotency and differentiation, we
   examine the differentiation of embryonic stem cells that are depleted of
   multiple H1 subtypes. H1c/H1d/H1e triple null ESCs are more resistant to
   spontaneous differentiation in adherent monolayer culture upon removal
   of leukemia inhibitory factor. Similarly, the majority of the triple-H1
   null embryoid bodies (EBs) lack morphological structures representing
   the three germ layers and retain gene expression signatures
   characteristic of undifferentiated ESCs. Furthermore, upon neural
   differentiation of EBs, triple-H1 null cell cultures are deficient in
   neurite outgrowth and lack efficient activation of neural markers.
   Finally, we discover that triple-H1 null embryos and EBs fail to fully
   repress the expression of the pluripotency genes in comparison with
   wild-type controls and that H1 depletion impairs DNA methylation and
   changes of histone marks at promoter regions necessary for efficiently
   silencing pluripotency gene Oct4 during stem cell differentiation and
   embryogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that H1 plays a critical role
   in pluripotent stem cell differentiation, and our results suggest that
   H1 and chromatin compaction may mediate pluripotent stem cell
   differentiation through epigenetic repression of the pluripotency genes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we identify important classes of program control flows in
   applications targeted to commercially available graphics processing
   units (GPUs) and characterize their presence in real workloads such as
   those that occur in CUDA and OpenCL. Broadly, control flow can be
   characterized as structured or unstructured. It is shown that most
   existing techniques for handling divergent control in bulk synchronous
   GPU applications handle structured control flow efficiently, some are
   incapable of executing unstructured control flow directly, and none
   handles unstructured control flow efficiently. An approach to reduce the
   impact of this problem is provided. An unstructured-to-structured
   control flow transformation for CUDA kernels is implemented and its
   performance impact on a large class of GPU applications is assessed. The
   results quantify the importance of improving support for programs with
   unstructured control flow on GPUs. The transformation can also be used
   in a JIT compiler pass to execute programs with unstructured control
   flow on the GPU devices that do not support unstructured control flow.
   This is an important capability for execution portability of
   applications using GPU accelerators.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology research and product development are actively conducted
   in many industries, (such as industries that manufacture advanced
   materials and semiconductors) and in medicine. Few studies have
   presented the potential application areas of nanotechnology in, and the
   needs of, the construction industry while identifying the benefits and
   barriers of entry in research and development. Some construction
   industry sectors follow research and development in nanotechnology;
   however, the industry does not take on a leadership role. With proper
   knowledge of the potential products and techniques offered through an
   investment in nanotechnology, the construction industry may potentially
   improve the efficiency of its processes and offer better products to
   clients such as those that exist in building and infrastructure
   construction and in environmental and petroleum engineering. This paper
   analyzes the understanding of nanotechnology in the context of
   construction and explores the current status of nanotechnology in the
   construction industry. Findings from a literature review, from a survey
   among construction industry professionals, and from expert interviews
   with leading researchers in construction-related nanotechnology research
   and development are presented to identify the potential benefits and
   existing barriers of using nanotechnology in construction. A
   multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework was developed to rank
   application areas of nanotechnology that will have major effects in the
   construction industry. Tasks were identified that will make the
   application of nanotechnology in construction successful in the future.

Abstract = {{Service accessibility is defined as the access of a community to the
   nearby site locations in a service network consisting of multiple
   geographically distributed service sites. Leveraging new statistical
   methods, this article estimates and classifies service accessibility
   patterns varying over a large geographic area (Georgia) and over a
   period of 16 years. The focus of this study is on financial services but
   it generally applies to any other service operation. To this end, we
   introduce a model-based method for clustering random time-varying
   functions that are spatially interdependent. The underlying clustering
   model is nonparametric with spatially correlated errors. We also assume
   that the clustering membership is a realization from a Markov random
   field. Under these model assumptions, we borrow information across
   functions corresponding to nearby spatial locations resulting in
   enhanced estimation accuracy of the cluster effects and of the cluster
   membership as shown in a simulation study. Supplementary materials
   including the estimation algorithm, additional maps of the data, and the
   C++ computer programs for analyzing the data in our case study are

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Serotonin/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has been implicated
   in valve disease and in the modulation of valve mechanical properties.
   Several 5-HT receptor subtypes are also known to be mechanosensitive in
   other cell types, but this has not been studied in the context of the
   valve. In this study, we sought to understand the effects of elevated
   5-HT levels and stretch overload on aortic valve remodeling and the
   dominant 5-HT receptor subtype that regulates these processes. Methods
   and results: Collagen biosynthesis and tissue mechanical properties of
   porcine aortic valve cusps were evaluated after 10\% (physiologic) and
   15\% (pathologic) dynamic stretch. These studies were performed in
   normal medium or medium supplemented with 5-HT (1, 10, 100 mu M) in the
   absence and presence of 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. Fresh
   valves served as controls. Valve collagen content was maximal at the
   10-mu M 5-HT concentration for both 10\% and 15\% stretch. The 5-HT2A
   receptor antagonist reduced collagen synthesis, cell proliferation, and
   hsp47 expression under elevated and normal stretch, whereas the 5-HT2B
   receptor antagonist was effective only at normal stretch. The
   pretransition stiffness of the valve cusps was also increased in
   response to 5-HT via a stretch-sensitive 5-HT2A mechanism, with the
   post-transition stiffness unaltered. Conclusions: Combined elevated
   stretch and 5-HT resulted in increased valve collagen biosynthesis, cell
   proliferation, and tissue stiffness. These responses were inhibited by a
   5-HT2A antagonist. This strongly suggests that the 5-HT2A receptor
   subtype is sensitive to elevated stretch. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Lamb wave testing for structural health monitoring (SHM) often relies on
   analysis of wavefields recorded through scanning laser Doppler
   vibrometers (SLDVs) or ultrasonic scanners. Damage detection and
   characterization with these techniques requires isolation of
   defect-induced reflections in the wavefield from the injected wave
   packet and from scattering events associated with structural features
   such as boundaries, rivets, joints, etc. This is a challenging task when
   dealing with complex structures and multimodal, dispersive propagation
   regimes, whereby various wave contributions in both the time/space and
   the frequency/wavenumber domain overlap.
   A new mathematical tool named warped curvelet frames (WCFs) is proposed
   to effectively decompose the recorded wavefields. The presented
   technique results from the combination of two operators, i.e., the
   curvelet transform (CT) and the warped frequency transform (WFT). The CT
   provides an optimally sparse representation of nondispersive wave
   propagators. Combining the CT with the WFT allows for a flexible
   analysis of multimodal wave propagation in dispersive media. Exploiting
   the spatial and temporal localization of curvelets, as well as the
   spectro-temporal adaptation of the analysis frame to the characteristics
   of each propagating mode, provided by frequency warping, a convenient
   decomposition of guided waves is achieved and relevant contributions can
   be effectively isolated.
   The proposed approach is validated through dedicated simulations and
   further tested experimentally to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   method in separating guided wave modes corresponding to acoustic events
   in close spatial proximity.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a reduced-order, physics-based model of gas cloud
   transport and combined it with an approximate formulation of the
   equation of radiative transport to enable efficient prediction of
   spectral irradiation for simulation of hyperspectral infrared sensors.
   The resulting combined model is easily implemented, providing a rapid
   and flexible in silico experimentation capability. The gas cloud model
   is based on the entrainment hypothesis and predicts cloud trajectories
   in three-dimensions, with elevation changes occurring primarily due to
   buoyancy effects and with spreading and accompanying dilution and
   cooling occurring due to a turbulence dominated growth mechanism. The
   radiation transport model is simplified through an approximate treatment
   of scattering that transforms the governing equation from an
   integro-differential equation to an ordinary differential equation. The
   conjugate model has been combined with a simple sensor model and has
   been validated through comparison to results from large-scale field
   tests. The utility of the simulations has also been demonstrated through
   inclusion in a larger algorithm development and analysis program, the
   chem/bio algorithm development kit. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We report an approach to the rapid release of DNA based on the
   application of electrochemical potentials to surfaces coated with
   polyelectrolyte-based thin films. We fabricated multilayered
   polyelectrolyte films (or ``polyelectrolyte multilayers{''}, PEMs) using
   plasmid DNA and a model hydrolytically degradable cationic
   poly(beta-amino ester) (polymer 1) on stainless steel substrates using a
   layer-by-layer approach. The application of continuous reduction
   potentials in the range of -1.1 to -0.7 V (vs a Ag/AgCl electrode) to
   film-coated electrodes in PBS at 37 degrees C resulted in the complete
   release of DNA over a period of 1-2 min. Film-coated electrodes
   incubated under identical conditions in the absence of applied
   potentials required 1-2 days for complete release. Control over the
   magnitude of the applied potential provided control over the rate at
   which DNA was released. The results of these and additional physical
   characterization experiments are consistent with a mechanism of film
   disruption that is promoted by local increases in pH at the
   film/electrode interface (resulting from electrochemical reduction of
   water or dissolved oxygen) that disrupt ionic interactions in these
   materials. The results of cell-based experiments demonstrated that DNA
   was released in a form that remains intact and able to promote transgene
   expression in mammalian cells. Finally, we demonstrate that short-term
   (i.e., non-continuous) electrochemical treatments can also be used to
   promote faster film erosion (e.g., over 1-2 h) once the potential is
   removed. Past studies demonstrate that PEMs fabricated using polymer 1
   can promote surface-mediated transfection of cells and tissues in vitro
   and in vivo. With further development, the electrochemical approaches
   reported here could thus provide new methods for the rapid, triggered,
   or spatially patterned transfer of DNA (or other agents) from surfaces
   of interest in a variety of fundamental and applied contexts.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Strain-gated piezotronic transistors have been fabricated using
   vertically aligned ZnO nanowires (NWs), which were grown on GaN/sapphire
   substrates using a vapor-liquid-solid process. The gate electrode of the
   transistor is replaced by the internal crystal potential generated by
   strain, and the control over the transported current is at the interface
   between the nanowire and the top or bottom electrode. The
   current-voltage characteristics of the devices were studied using
   conductive atomic force microscopy, and the results show that the
   current flowing through the ZnO NWs can be tuned/gated by the mechanical
   force applied to the NWs. This phenomenon was attributed to the
   piezoelectric tuning of the Schottky barrier at the Au-ZnO junction,
   known as the piezotronic effect. Our study demonstrates the possibility
   of using Au droplet capped ZnO NWs as a transistor array for mapping
   local strain. More importantly, our design gives the possibility of
   fabricating an array of transistors using individual vertical nanowires
   that can be controlled independently by applying mechanical
   force/pressure over the top. Such a structure is likely to have
   important applications in high-resolution mapping of
   strain/force/pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells encapsulated with pH-responsive
   synthetic nanoshells from lightly cross-linked polymethacrylic add
   showed a high viability rate of around 90\%, an indication of high
   biocompatibility of synthetic pH-responsive shells. We demonstrated that
   increasing pH above the isoelectric point of the polymer shell leads to
   a delay in growth rate; however, it does not affect the expression of
   enhanced green fluorescent protein. We suggest that progressive
   ionization and charge accumulation within the synthetic shells evoke a
   structural change in the outer shells which affect the membrane
   transport. This change facilitates the ability to manipulate growth
   kinetics and functionality of the cells with the surrounding
   environment. We observed that hollow layer-by layer nanoshells showed a
   remarkable degree of reversible swelling/deswelling over a narrow pH
   range (pH 5.0-6.0), but their assembly directly on the cell surface
   resulted in the suppression of large dimensional changes. We suggest
   that the variation in surface charges caused by
   deprotonation/protonation of carboxylic groups in the nanoshells
   controlled cell growth and cell function, which can be utilized for
   external chemical control of cell-based biosensors.}},

Title = {{Investigations of Electra KrF laser hibachi foil cooling with small

Abstract = {{Electra is a large electron beam pumped KrF laser with transmission
   foils that separate the vacuum diodes from the laser gas. Active cooling
   of these foils is important when Electra operates at a rep-rate of 5 Hz
   because the attenuation of the electron beam by the foil produces a
   volumetric heating source. A method adopting a large number of locally
   injected high-speed circular gas jets was explored experimentally and
   numerically for the purpose of cooling and protecting the hibachi foil
   with an enhanced convection heat transfer rate. The jets were issued
   from the openings on two stainless-steel jet tubes parallel to the foil
   in a fashion such that the two straight lines of jets impinge on the
   foil obliquely and form a staggered coverage of the foil. CFD
   simulations were performed to identify the best jet impingement
   configuration. Bench-top experiments were performed at various jet
   diameters and jet velocities for a single foil span between two
   neighboring supporting ribs with a surface heat flux over 20.0 kW/m(2).
   Heat transfer enhancement of 60-700\% over the case with jets turned off
   was observed depending on jet Reynolds numbers. Experimental Nusselt
   numbers were well-correlated with jet Reynolds number and the normalized
   jet-to-foil distance. The study shows, that the impinging jets enhance
   heat transfer from the surface and offer an improved average cooling for
   a much larger foil area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights. reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Relay networks with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol have attracted
   attention due to its high performance and low implementation complexity
   at the relay. To collect full cooperative diversity, the AF relay
   networks are facing two main issues. One is that the channel state
   information (CSI) of the source to relay link (i.e., two-hop
   information) is needed at the destination. The other concern is that the
   power scaling factor (PSF) and output signals at the relay are
   unbounded. These two issues make AF less practical in resource
   constrained networks, e.g., blind and peak power constrained relays. In
   this paper, we reveal the sufficient and necessary conditions on the PSF
   for the maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver with two-hop CSI to
   achieve full cooperative diversity. Furthermore, we also provide
   necessary conditions on the PSF design so that MRC with one-hop CSI
   still collects full cooperative diversity. Based on these design
   criteria, we show a practical peak power constrained AF strategy so that
   neither the relay nor the destination node needs the source-relay CSI,
   yet full cooperative diversity can still be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been deposited on silicon and glass
   surfaces via a super-critical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2) synthesis route
   for application in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Arrhenius
   plots revealed that nucleation and growth processes in this system
   depend on both temperature and surface chemistry. Results also
   demonstrated that temperature and surface chemistry could be varied to
   control nanoparticle properties, such as the mean nanoparticle size,
   density, and surface coverage, providing two useful variables for
   manipulating the properties of AgNPs deposited on surfaces in this
   system. These data also provide scientific insight into the underlying
   mechanisms governing heterogeneous AgNP deposition on a substrate in a
   sc-CO2 system in addition to engineering insight into the variables that
   can be used to manipulate AgNP characteristics. The mean particle size
   could be tuned over the range 20-200 nm, the interparticle distance
   could be tuned over the range 70 nm-1 mu m, and the surface coverage
   could be tuned over the range 0.035-0.58. Products were analyzed by
   scanning electron microscopy with image analysis, transmission electron
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and SERS. The silver nanoparticle-coated
   substrates were successfully applied in SERS, detecting the model
   analyte Rhodamine 6G at a concentration of 1 mu M, a three orders of
   magnitude improvement over SERS surfaces previously fabricated in sc-CO2
   systems. Such surfaces can find use in trace concentration analyte
   detection in biomedical, chemical, and environmental applications.}},

Abstract = {{Two grand challenges have been declared as premier goals of
   computational systems biology. The first is the discovery of network
   motifs and design principles that help us understand and rationalize why
   biological systems are organized in the manner we encounter them rather
   than in a different fashion. The second goal is the development of
   computational models supporting the investigation of complex systems, in
   particular, as simulation platforms in personalized medicine and
   predictive health. Interestingly, most published systems models in
   biology contain between a handful and a few dozen variables. They are
   usually too complicated for systemic analyses of organizing principles,
   but they are at the same time too coarse to allow reliable simulations
   of diseases. While it may thus appear that the modeling efforts of the
   past have missed the declared targets of systems biology, we argue in
   this article that midsized mesoscopic models are excellent starting
   points for pursuing both goals in computational systems biology.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous planning models within the chemical, petroleum, and process
   industries involve coordinating the movement of raw materials in
   distribution networks so they can be blended into final products. The
   uncapacitated fixed-charge transportation problem with blending (FCTPwB)
   studied in this paper captures a core structure encountered in many of
   these environments. We model the FCTPwB as a mixed-integer linear
   program, and we derive two classes of facets, both exponential in size,
   for the convex hull of solutions for the problem with a single consumer
   and show that they can be separated in polynomial time. Furthermore, we
   prove that, in certain situations, these classes of facets along with
   the continuous relaxation of the original constraints yield a
   description of the convex hull. Finally, we present a computational
   study that demonstrates that these classes of facets are effective in
   reducing the integrality gap and solution time for more general
   instances of the FCTPwB with arc capacities and multiple consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic, discontinuous flow is ubiquitous in the plastic deformation
   of small-volume metallic materials. We have identified a
   size-strengthening effect on the stress to initiate the jerky plastic
   yielding in nanoscale volumes of copper single crystals, subjected to
   nano-indentation in different orientations. Such a nanoscale size effect
   arises due to the stochastic nature of dislocation sources, in contrast
   to the microscale size effect often attributed to plastic strain
   gradients. The jerky response can result from the activation of either
   surface or bulk heterogeneous dislocation sources, as governed by the
   distribution and resistance of dislocation locks. Implications
   concerning the deformation mechanism in materials with flow
   defect-limited characteristics are discussed. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the mechanical strength of polycrystalline silicon
   wafers cut by loose abrasive slurry and fixed abrasive diamond wire
   sawing processes. Four line bending and biaxial flexure tests are used
   to evaluate the fracture strength of the wafers. Fracture strength of
   the wafers depends on the location, size, and orientation of microcracks
   in the silicon wafer and the distribution and magnitude of applied
   stresses. Measurement of microcracks at the wafer edge and center shows
   that edge cracks are typically larger than center cracks. Fixed abrasive
   diamond wire sawn wafers are found to have a higher crack density but
   smaller average crack length. Wafer fracture in four line bending is
   found to be primarily due to the propagation of edge cracks while center
   cracks are found to be the primary cause of wafer failure in biaxial
   flexure tests. Fracture mechanics based analyses demonstrate that crack
   orientation plays a significant role in four line bending, but not in
   biaxial flexure. Correlations of the wafer fracture strength and
   critical crack length agree well with microcrack measurements. The
   fracture strength of diamond cut wafers is found to be comparable or
   superior to the strength of slurry cut wafers.}},

Abstract = {{Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO; E.C. 1.13.12.16) oxidizes alkyl nitronates
   to aldehydes and nitrite. Although the biochemistry of the enzyme from
   fungal sources has been studied extensively, the physiological role is
   unknown. The ability of NMO to detoxify propionate-3-nitronate was
   tested by measuring growth of recombinant Escherichia coli containing
   the gene encoding for the enzyme in either the absence or presence of
   the nitronate and its conjugate acid 3-nitropropionate. The mixture
   propionate-3-nitronate/3-nitropropionate is toxic to E. coli cells
   lacking expression of NMO, but the toxicity is overcome through either
   induction of the gene for NMO or through addition of exogenous enzyme to
   the cultures. Both Williopsis saturnus and Neurospora crassa were able
   to grow in the presence of 0.4 mM propionate-3-nitronate and 19.6 mM
   3-nitropropionate, while a knockout mutant of N. crassa lacking NMO was
   inhibited by concentrations of propionate-3-nitronate and
   3-nitropropionate >0.3 and 600 mu M, respectively. These results
   strongly support the conclusion that NMO functions to protect the fungi
   from the environmental occurrence of the metabolic toxin. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Engineering materials suitable for vascular prostheses has been a
   significant challenge, especially in promoting extracellular matrix
   (ECM) development within synthetic materials. Herein we have utilized
   two different elastin mimetic peptide sequences, EM-19 and EM-23, to
   provide a template for ECM deposition when covalently incorporated into
   scaffold materials. Both peptides contain the hexapeptide sequence
   VGVAPG, which interacts with the cell surface receptor known as the
   elastin binding protein (EBP). Additionally, EM-23 contains an RGDS
   sequence intended for the peptide's interaction with the a
   alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. We first confirm that the presence of both
   peptides approximates the synergistic mechanism for elastic fiber
   assembly in vivo, a process that utilizes both the EBP and
   alpha(v)beta(3). Peptides were then grafted onto the surface of a
   poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogel and their efficacy as
   templates for promoting cell adhesion, spreading, and elastin deposition
   was evaluated. Although both peptides were able to encourage smooth
   muscle cell (SMC) adhesion and elastin deposition over PEG-DA and
   PEG-RGDS controls, PEG-grafted EM-23 was proven to be the more promising
   motif for inclusion in synthetic substrates to be used in the
   engineering of vascular tissues, enhancing cell adhesion 60-fold and
   elastin content 2-fold compared with PEG-RGDS.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{34-45}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the past two decades, rapid population and economic growth on the
   U.S.-Mexico border has spurred a dramatic increase in electricity
   demand. In response, American energy multinationals have built power
   plants just south of the border that export most of their electricity to
   the U.S. This development has stirred considerable controversy because
   these plants effectively skirt U.S. air pollution regulations in a
   severely degraded international airshed. Yet to our knowledge, this
   concern has not been subjected to rigorous scrutiny. This paper uses a
   suite of air dispersion, health impacts, and valuation models to assess
   the human health damages in the U.S. and Mexico caused by air emissions
   from two power-exporting plants in Mexicali, Baja California. We find
   that these emissions have limited but nontrivial health impacts, mostly
   by exacerbating particulate pollution in the U.S., and we value these
   damages at more than half a million dollars per year. These findings
   demonstrate that power-exporting plants can have cross-border health
   effects and bolster the case for systematically evaluating their
   environmental impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smart projectile state estimation is a challenging task due to highly
   nonlinear vehicle dynamic behavior and unreliable or noisy sensor
   feedback. Although Kalman-filter-based algorithms are currently the
   primary means of sensor fusion and state estimation for smart weapons
   applications, they are limited in estimation accuracy, their ability to
   combine data from a wide variety of sensors, and their ability to
   recognize and reject erroneous feedback. This paper explores the use of
   evidence theory (or Dempster Shafer theory) for projectile state
   estimation purposes. Evidence theory offers a generalized framework
   capable of incorporating feedback from a wide variety of sensors with
   little a priori knowledge about sensor noise characteristics. The
   framework's main strengths are its ability to manage varying levels of
   dynamic uncertainty between sensors and its capability to recognize and
   report conflicting sensor feedback. The paper begins with an overview of
   evidence theory and a discussion of its strengths when applied to
   projectile state estimation. Then an evidence-theory-based filter is
   described, and an example roll-angle estimator is presented. Results are
   discussed and performance is compared with an extended Kalman filter.
   The ability to identify and eliminate malfunctioning sensors from the
   estimation process proves to be a key advantage of the proposed design
   over current methods.}},

   THRESHOLD DEMAND ALLOCATION IN A MULTIPLE-SERVER QUEUEING ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{We study the optimal demand allocation policies to induce high service
   capacity and achieve minimum expected sojourn times in equilibrium in a
   queueing system with multiple strategic servers. We propose the mixed
   threshold allocation policy as an optimal state-dependent policy that
   induces optimal service capacity from strategic servers. Compensation to
   the server can be paid at customer allocation or upon job completion.
   Our study focuses on the use of a multiple-server mixed threshold
   allocation policy to replicate the demand of a given state-independent
   policy to achieve a symmetric equilibrium with lower expected sojourn
   time. The results indicate that, under both payment schemes, for any
   given multiple-server state-independent policy, there exists a
   multiple-server threshold policy that produces identical demand
   allocation and Nash equilibrium (if any). Moreover, the policy can be
   designed to minimize the expected sojourn time at a symmetric
   equilibrium. Furthermore, under the payment-at-allocation scheme, our
   results, combining with existing results on the optimality of the
   multiple-server linear allocation policy, show that the mixed threshold
   policy can achieve the maximum feasible service capacity and thus the
   minimum feasible equilibrium expected sojourn time. Hence, our results
   agree with previous two-server results and affirm that a trade-off
   between incentives and efficiency need not exist in the case of multiple
   servers.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of research and development, a fully automated system for
   pavement crack detection with an intensity-based two-dimensional (2D)
   imaging data acquisition system under different lighting and low
   intensity contrast conditions still remains a challenge. With the
   advances of sensor technology, a three-dimensional (3D) laser technology
   that can collect high-resolution 3D continuous transverse pavement
   profiles for detecting cracks on the basis of their 3D elevation rather
   than 2D intensity has become available. This study, sponsored by the
   U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) Research Innovative
   Technology Administration (RITA) program, evaluates the feasibility of
   using emerging 3D laser technology to detect cracks under different
   lighting and poor intensity contrast conditions. For this purpose, 3D
   surface data from laboratory tests on cracks ranging from 1 to 5mm wide
   and tests on the actual pavement cracks of different widths and depths
   and under different lighting conditions were performed. The
   dynamic-optimization-based crack segmentation method was employed to
   detect cracks. A linear-buffered Hausdorff scoring method was used to
   quantitatively evaluate the crack segmentation performance by comparing
   the detected cracks with the manually established ground truth. The
   preliminary test results show that: (1) the 3D laser system can
   effectively detect cracks equal to and greater than 2 mm wide under
   controlled laboratory environment, (2) it can achieve consistent results
   when detecting cracks under different lighting conditions (i.e.,
   nighttime, daytime with shadow, and daytime no shadow), and (3) it can
   detect cracks with low intensity contrast. Future research is
   recommended. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000353. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Prevention of sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers subject to
   groundwater withdrawal requires optimization of well pumping rates to
   maximize the water supply while avoiding sea water intrusion. Boundary
   conditions and the aquifer domain size have significant influences on
   simulating flow and concentration fields and estimating maximum pumping
   rates. In this study, an analytical solution is derived based on the
   potential-flow theory for evaluating maximum groundwater pumping rates
   in a domain with a constant hydraulic head landward boundary. An
   empirical correction factor, which was introduced by Pool and Carrera
   (2011) to account for mixing in the case with a constant recharge rate
   boundary condition, is found also applicable for the case with a
   constant hydraulic head boundary condition, and therefore greatly
   improves the usefulness of the sharp-interface analytical solution.
   Comparing with the solution for a constant recharge rate boundary, we
   find that a constant hydraulic head boundary often yields larger
   estimations of the maximum pumping rate and when the domain size is five
   times greater than the distance between the well and the coastline, the
   effect of setting different landward boundary conditions becomes
   insignificant with a relative difference between two solutions less than
   2.5\%. These findings can serve as a preliminary guidance for conducting
   numerical simulations and designing tank-scale laboratory experiments
   for studying groundwater withdrawal problems in coastal aquifers with
   minimized boundary condition effects.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the traditional RF circuits are static or minimally tunable
   using some digital controllability. For example, high power, low power
   and shut down modes are available in some commercially available
   transceivers. If available, the tuning knobs affect different
   specifications in an interdependent manner, resulting in changing
   several specifications when only one needs to be tuned. This is not
   enough for power optimal operation of complete self-aware self-adaptive
   circuits and systems. Independent or orthogonal tunability of the
   important conflicting specifications using built-in tuning knobs allow
   optimal adaptation of the wireless systems. In this paper we demonstrate
   the design and benefits of orthogonal tuning knobs using an inductorless
   LNA as a test vehicle. The design of an orthogonally tunable LNA is
   discussed that has a 14 dB Gain tuning range and 30 dB OIP3 tuning range
   as its power consumption goes down by 20x. Measurement results on this
   LNA validate the concept of orthogonal tunability. Use of this
   orthogonally tunable LNA within an adaptive wireless receiver framework
   shows power savings of 2x compared to a static system and an extra
   savings of 22\% compared to a traditional nonorthogonal adaptive system.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinearity of a silicon resonator can lead to improved phase-noise
   performance in an oscillator when the phase shift of the sustaining
   amplifier forces the operating point to a steeper phase-frequency slope.
   As a result, phase modulation on the oscillator frequency is minimized
   because the resonator behaves as a high-order phase filter. The effect
   of the increased filtering translates into phase-noise shaping that
   reflects superior overall performance. Nonlinear effects in MEMS
   oscillators can be induced via sufficient driving power, generating
   low-frequency nonwhite noise processes that need to be considered in a
   phase-noise description. Since the phase-frequency response is not
   symmetric for a nonlinear detuned resonator, an empirical model based on
   power series is proposed to describe its effect in the noise sources and
   to account for the observed higher effective quality factor of the
   oscillator, the reduction in the corner frequency, and elevated levels
   of flicker noise very close-to-carrier. The applicability of the
   presented phase-noise model is shown for three piezoelectric MEMS
   oscillators, producing a relative fitting error below 1\% in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the design and parametric numerical study of a
   hybrid heat sink combining a liquid thermal interface with an array of
   synthetic jet actuators for 3-D chip stack cooling. The air-side heat
   sink exploits enhanced localized heat transfer achieved via a central
   array of synthetic jet actuators. The key focus of this paper is the
   numerical simulation of the dielectric liquid interface used to
   efficiently transmit the heat from the high-power 3-D stacked
   electronics to the hybrid heat sink base. The coupled natural convection
   in the fluid and conduction in solid spreaders sandwiched between the
   tiers of the stack form a novel efficient, passive, and scalable thermal
   management solution for 3-D stacked die structures. It is shown that
   this heat sink with a footprint of 76-mm square x 51-mm height can
   dissipate a total of 41 W of heat/power from the stack for a 44 degrees
   C average chip temperature rise above ambient (an R-ja of similar to

Abstract = {{Wireless nanosensor networks (WNSNs) consist of nanosized communicating
   devices, which can detect and measure new types of events at the
   nanoscale. WNSNs are the enabling technology for unique applications
   such as intrabody drug delivery systems or surveillance networks for
   chemical attack prevention. One of the major bottlenecks in WNSNs is
   posed by the very limited energy that can be stored in a nanosensor mote
   in contrast to the energy that is required by the device to communicate.
   Recently, novel energy harvesting mechanisms have been proposed to
   replenish the energy stored in nanodevices. With these mechanisms, WNSNs
   can overcome their energy bottleneck and even have infinite lifetime
   (perpetual WNSNs), provided that the energy harvesting and consumption
   processes are jointly designed. In this paper, an energy model for
   self-powered nanosensor motes is developed, which successfully captures
   the correlation between the energy harvesting and the energy consumption
   processes. The energy harvesting process is realized by means of a
   piezoelectric nanogenerator, for which a new circuital model is
   developed that can accurately reproduce existing experimental data. The
   energy consumption process is due to the communication among nanosensor
   motes in the terahertz band (0.1-10 THz). The proposed energy model
   captures the dynamic network behavior by means of a probabilistic
   analysis of the total network traffic and the multiuser interference. A
   mathematical framework is developed to obtain the probability
   distribution of the nanosensor mote energy and to investigate the
   end-to-end successful packet delivery probability, the end-to-end packet
   delay, and the achievable throughput of WNSNs. Nanosensor motes have not
   been built yet and, thus, the development of an analytical energy model
   is a fundamental step toward the design of WNSNs architectures and
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Current AASHTO specifications provide engineers with a temperature
   gradient across the depth of the cross section to predict the vertical
   thermal behavior of bridges. This gradient is based on one-dimensional
   heat flow and does not account for change in the cross section, as found
   in prestressed concrete girders, nor does it account for thermal effects
   on the sides of the girder. Furthermore, the current specifications do
   not provide the transverse temperature gradient that is needed to
   predict the lateral thermal behavior of the girders, especially during
   construction, before the placement of the bridge decks. To determine the
   transverse and vertical temperature gradients in prestressed concrete
   girders, experimental and analytical studies were conducted on a
   prestressed BT-63 concrete girder segment. The analytical results were
   found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. The
   analytical model was then used to determine the seasonal temperature
   gradients in four standard PCI girder sections at selected cities in the
   United States. On the basis of these findings, vertical and transverse
   temperature gradients were developed to aid engineers in predicting the
   thermal behavior of prestressed girders during construction. DOI:

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to fabricate an integrated power pack by
   hybridizing energy harvest and storage processes. This power pack
   incorporates a series-wound dye. sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and a
   lithium ion battery (LIB) on the same Ti foil that has double-sided TiO2
   nanotube (NTs) arrays. The solar cell part is made of two different
   cosensitized tandem solar cells based on TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRs) and
   NTs, respectively, which provide an open-circuit voltage of 3.39 V and a
   short-circuit current density of 1.01 mA/cm(2). The power pack can be
   charged to about 3 V in about 8 min, and the discharge capacity is about
   38.89 mu Ah under the discharge density of 100 mu A. The total energy
   conversion and storage efficiency for this system is 0.82\%. Such an
   integrated power pack could serve as a power source for mobile
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Flavoprotein reductases that catalyze the transformation of
   nitroglycerin (NG) to dinitro- or mononitroglycerols enable bacteria
   containing such enzymes to use NG as the nitrogen source. The inability
   to use the resulting mononitroglycerols limits most strains to
   incomplete denitration of NG. Recently, Arthrobacter strain JBH1 was
   isolated for the ability to grow on NG as the sole source of carbon and
   nitrogen, but the enzymes and mechanisms involved were not established.
   Here, the enzymes that enable the Arthrobacter strain to incorporate NG
   into a productive pathway were identified. Enzyme assays indicated that
   the transformation of nitroglycerin to mononitroglycerol is NADPH
   dependent and that the subsequent transformation of mononitroglycerol is
   ATP dependent. Cloning and heterologous expression revealed that a
   flavoprotein catalyzes selective denitration of NG to
   1-mononitroglycerol (1-MNG) and that 1-MNG is transformed to
   1-nitro-3-phosphoglycerol by a glycerol kinase homolog. Phosphorylation
   of the nitroester intermediate enables the subsequent denitration of
   1-MNG in a productive pathway that supports the growth of the isolate
   and mineralization of NG.}},

Abstract = {{The voluntary EMG (vEMG) signal from electrically stimulated muscle is
   very useful for feedback control in functional electrical stimulation.
   However, the recorded EMG signal from surface electrodes has unwanted
   stimulation artifact and M-wave as well as vEMG. Here, we propose an
   event-synchronous adaptive digital filter for the suppression of
   stimulation artifact and M-wave in this application. The proposed method
   requires a simple experimental setup that does not require extra
   hardware connections to obtain the reference signals of adaptive digital
   filter. For evaluating the efficiency of this proposed method, the
   filter was tested and compared with a least square (LS) algorithm using
   previously measured data. We conclude that the cancellation of both
   primary and residual stimulation artifacts is enhanced with an
   event-synchronous adaptive digital filter and shows promise for clinical
   application to rehabilitate paretic limbs. Moreover because this
   algorithm is far simpler than the LS algorithm, it is portable and ready
   for real-time application.}},

Abstract = {{Antioxidant therapy can protect against ischemic injury, but the
   inability to selectively target the kidney would require extremely high
   doses to achieve effective local concentrations of drug. Here, we
   developed a directed therapeutic that specifically targets an
   antioxidant to renal proximal tubule cells via the folate receptor.
   Because a local increase in superoxide contributes to renal ischemic
   injury, we created the folate-antioxidant conjugate 4-hydroxy-Tempo
   (tempol)-folate to target folate receptors, which are highly expressed
   in the proximal tubule. Dihydroethidium high-performance liquid
   chromatography demonstrated that conjugated tempol retained its efficacy
   to scavenge superoxide in proximal tubule cells. In a mouse model of
   renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, tempol-folate reduced renal
   superoxide levels more effectively than tempol alone. Furthermore,
   electron spin resonance revealed the successful targeting of the
   tempol-folate conjugate to the kidney and other tissues expressing
   folate receptors. Administration of tempol-folate protected the renal
   function of mice after ischemia-reperfusion injury and inhibited
   infiltration of macrophages. In conclusion, kidney-specific targeting of
   an antioxidant has therapeutic potential to prevent renal ischemic
   injury. Conjugation of other pharmaceuticals to folate may also
   facilitate the development of treatments for other kidney diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of condensation-induced water hammer with one-dimensional
   two-fluid model requires explicit modeling of slug formation, slug
   propagation, and in some cases slug decay Stratified flow correlations
   that are more or less well known in 1D two-fluid models, are crucial for
   accurate description of the initial phase of the slug formation and slug
   propagation. Slug formation means transition to other flow regime that
   requires different set of correlations. To use such two-fluid model for
   condensation induced water hammer simulations, a single slug must be
   explicitly recognized and captured. In the present work two cases of
   condensation-induced water hammer simulations performed with WAHA code,
   are described and discussed: injection of cold liquid into horizontal
   pipe filled with steam and injection of hot steam into horizontal pipe
   partially filled with cold liquid.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops new real time prediction models for output power and
   energy efficiency of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. These models were
   validated using measured data of a grid-connected solar PV system in
   Macau. Both time frames based on yearly average and monthly average are
   considered. It is shown that the prediction model for the yearly/monthly
   average of the minutely output power fits the measured data very well
   with high value of R-2. The online prediction model for system
   efficiency is based on the ratio of the predicted output power to the
   predicted solar irradiance. This ratio model is shown to be able to fit
   the intermediate phase (9 am to 4 pm) very well but not accurate for the
   growth and decay phases where the system efficiency is near zero.
   However, it can still serve as a useful purpose for practitioners as
   most PV systems work in the most efficient manner over this period. It
   is shown that the maximum monthly average minutely efficiency varies
   over a small range of 10.81\% to 12.63\% in different months with
   slightly higher efficiency in winter months. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wurtzite structures, such as ZnO, GaN, InN and CdS, are piezoelectric
   semiconductor materials. A piezopotential is formed in the crystal by
   the piezoelectric charges created by applying a stress. The
   inner-crystal piezopotential can effectively tune/control the carrier
   separations and transport processes at the vicinity of a p-n junction or
   metal-semiconductor contact, which is called the piezo-phototronic
   effect. The presence of piezoelectric charges at the interface/junction
   can significantly affect the performances of photovoltaic devices,
   especially flexible and printed organic/inorganic solar cells fabricated
   using piezoelectric semiconductor nano/microwires. In this paper, the
   current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell have been studied
   theoretically and experimentally in the presence of the piezoelectric
   effect. The analytical results are obtained for a ZnO piezoelectric p-n
   junction solar cell under simplified conditions, which provide a basic
   physical picture for understanding the mechanism of the piezoelectric
   solar cell. Furthermore, the maximum output of the solar cell has been
   calculated numerically. Finally, the experimental results of organic
   solar cells support our theoretical model. Using the piezoelectric
   effect created by external stress, our study not only provides the first
   basic theoretical understanding about the piezo-phototronic effect on
   the characteristics of a solar cell but also assists the design for
   higher performance solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium oxides may offer high pseudocapacitance but limited electrical

   uniform deposition of smooth nanostructured vanadium oxide coatings on

   offering a novel route for the formation of binder-free flexible
   composite electrode fabric for supercapacitor applications with large
   thickness, controlled porosity, greatly improved electrical conductivity
   and cycle stability. Electrochemical measurements revealed stable
   performance of the selected MWCNT-vanadium oxide electrodes and
   remarkable capacitance of up to similar to 1550 F g(-1) per active mass
   of the vanadium oxide and up to similar to 600 F g(-1) per mass of the
   composite electrode, significantly exceeding specific capacitance of
   commercially used activated carbons (100-150 F g(-1)). Electrochemical
   performance of the oxide layers was found to strongly depend on the

Abstract = {{In this letter, we report on the ink-jet full grid-line cells with three
   different Ag dosages (70, 90, and 130 mg) on 75-Omega/sq emitters. We
   observed that the open-circuit voltage (V-OC), short-circuit current
   density (J(SC)), and fill factor (FF) were highest for the 130-mg dose
   and decrease thereafter as the Ag dosage decreases. Because of the
   decreased FF with decreasing Ag dosage, the efficiency followed the same
   trend. However, we demonstrated, for the first time, fully ink-jetted
   front Ag gridlines with an FF of 0.765 and efficiency of 18.4\% on
   239-cm(2) commercial CZ wafers with a sheet resistance of 75 Omega/sq.
   Noteworthy is the achievement of 17.8\% efficiency with only 70 mg of
   Ag, which is similar to 68\% less Ag than that used on cells with
   screen-printed gridlines. This represents a Ag cost saving of similar
   to\$0.245 per 6-inch wafer compared to the screen-printed counterpart
   with 220 mg of Ag.}},

Abstract = {{Path-planning problems are fundamental in many applications, such as
   transportation, artificial intelligence, control of autonomous vehicles,
   and many more. In this paper, we consider the deterministic
   path-planning problem, equivalently, the single-pair shortest path
   problem on a given grid-like graph structure. Current commonly used
   algorithms in this area include the A{*} algorithm, Dijkstra's
   algorithm, and their numerous variants. We propose an innovative
   beamlet-based graph structure for path planning that utilizes multiscale
   information of the environment. This information is collected via a
   bottom-up fusion algorithm. This new graph structure goes beyond
   ``nearest-neighbor{''} connectivity, incorporating ``long-distance{''}
   interactions between the nodes of the graph. Based on this new graph
   structure, we obtain a multiscale version of A{*}, which is advantageous
   when preprocessing is allowable and feasible. Compared to the benchmark
   A{*} algorithm, the use of multiscale information leads to an
   improvement in terms of computational complexity. Numerical experiments
   indicate an even more favorable behavior than the one predicted by the
   theoretical complexity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient, timely, and accurate state estimation is a prerequisite
   for most energy management system (EMS) applications in power system
   control centers. The emerging wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs)
   offer new opportunities for developing more effective methods to monitor
   power system dynamics online. Recently, alternative methods for power
   system state estimation have caught much attention. Due to the
   nonlinearity of state transition and observation equation, linearization
   and Jacobian matrix calculation are indispensible in the existing
   methods of power system state estimation. This makes WAMS' high
   performance compromised by burdensome calculation. In order to overcome
   the drawbacks, this study tries to develop an effective state estimation
   method without the linearization and Jacobian matrix calculation.
   Firstly, unscented transformation is introduced as an effective method
   to calculate the means and covariances of a random vector undergoing a
   nonlinear transformation. Secondly, by embedding the unscented
   transformation into the Kalman filter process, a method is developed for
   power system dynamic state estimation. Finally, some simulation results
   are presented showing accuracy and easier implementation of the new
   method.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Deformation of granular materials is often characterized by strain
   localization in the form of shear bands, which exhibit a characteristic
   width of about 10-20 particle diameters. Much of the relative motion of
   particles within a shear band is accompanied by rolling, as opposed to
   sliding, since the latter requires more dissipative work. However, in a
   densely packed assembly, rolling cannot be accomplished without some
   sliding. This dissipative constraint implies a characteristic rotation
   transmission distance, i.e., the distance to which the information about
   rotation of a particle propagates. Here, we use the discrete element
   method to investigate this length and its directional dependence as
   function of the force chain network. We found that the rotation
   transmission distance correlates with the shear band width observed in
   experiments and previous numerical simulations. It is strongly dependent
   on the particle size distribution and the coefficient of interparticle
   friction, and weakly dependent on pressure. Moreover, the transmission
   of rotations is strongly directionally dependent following the pattern
   of force chains. To describe this dependence, we define a nonlocal
   tensorial description of force chain directionality. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel robust controller design for formation
   control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We consider a
   nonlinear three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the horizontal

   dynamics of AUVs are explicitly expressed as dynamics for formation
   shape and formation center, and are further decoupled by feedback
   control. We treat the coupling terms as perturbations to the decoupled
   system. An H-infinity state feedback controller is designed to achieve
   robust stability of the closed loop formation and translation dynamics.
   By incorporating an orientation controller, the formation shape under
   control converges and the formation center tracks a desired trajectory
   simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   controllers. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005507]}},

Journal = {{MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{19-26}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An integrated photolithography and imprint lithography process has been
   developed to improve the patterning of photosensitive polymers in the
   fabrication of high aspect-ratio, polymer structures. In the
   photo-imprint process, a transparent stamp with surface relief
   structures was brought into contact with a photo-sensitive material.
   Temperature and pressure were applied to cause the photo-sensitive
   material to fill the mold, and UV light was then used to irradiate the
   polymer. The photo-imprint process advance was demonstrated on
   hollow-core structures. To develop high aspect-ratio, hollow-core
   pillars, a shallow photo-imprint stamp has been developed to physically
   displace material from the polymer core. Since the imprint stamp
   displaces material in the region of the feature, the effective film
   thickness is reduced compared to the bulk film. The reduction in film
   height decreased the effect of UV scattering in the core and also
   facilitated transport of the developer within the core. This
   photo-imprint lithography process is shown to be able to fabricate
   hollow core polymer pillars that exceed the optical-only resolution
   capabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the relative susceptibility of cartilage and
   meniscus tissues to mechanical injury by applying a single, controlled
   overload and observing cellular, biochemical, and mechanical changes.
   Design: Cartilage and meniscus tissue explants in radial confinement
   were subjected to a range of injury by indenting to 40\% strain at three
   different strain rates: 0.5\%/s (slow), 5\%/s (medium), or 50\%/s
   (fast). Following injury, samples were cultured for either 1 or 9 days.
   Explants were assayed for cell metabolic activity, water content, and
   sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content. Mechanical properties of
   explants were determined in torsional shear and unconfined compression.
   Conditioned medium was assayed for sGAG and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
   release.
   Results: Peak injury force increased with strain rate but both tissues
   displayed little to no macroscopic damage. Cell metabolism was lowest in
   medium and fast groups on day 1. Cell lysis increased with peak injury
   force and loading rate in both tissues. In contrast, sGAG content and
   release did not significantly vary with loading rate. Additionally,
   mechanical properties did not significantly vary with loading rate in
   either tissue.
   Conclusion: By use of a custom confinement chamber, large peak forces
   were obtained without macroscopic destruction of the explants. At the
   loads achieved in this studied, cell damage was induced without
   detectable physical or compositional changes. These results indicate
   that sub-failure injury can induce biologic damage that may not be
   readily detected and could be an early event in osteoarthritis genesis.

Abstract = {{Titanium (Ti) has been widely used as an implant material due to the
   excellent biocompatibility and corrosion resistance of its oxide
   surface. Biomaterials must be sterile before implantation, but the
   effects of sterilization on their surface properties have been less well
   studied. The effects of cleaning and sterilization on surface
   characteristics were bio-determined using contaminated and pure Ti
   substrata first manufactured to present two different surface
   structures: pretreated titanium (PT, Ra = 0.4 mu m) (i.e. surfaces that
   were not modified by sandblasting and/or acid etching); (SLA, Ra = 3.4
   mu m). Previously cultured cells and associated extracellular matrix
   were removed from all bio-contaminated specimens by cleaning in a
   sonicator bath with a sequential acetone-isopropanol-ethanol-distilled
   water protocol. Cleaned specimens were sterilized with autoclave, gamma
   irradiation, oxygen plasma, or ultraviolet light. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements, profilometry, and
   scanning electron microscopy were used to examine surface chemical
   components, hydrophilicity, roughness, and morphology, respectively.
   Small organic molecules present on contaminated Ti surfaces were removed
   with cleaning. XPS analysis confirmed that surface chemistry was altered
   by both cleaning and sterilization. Cleaning and sterilization affected
   hydrophobicity and roughness. These modified surface properties affected
   osteogenic differentiation of human MG63 osteoblast-like cells.
   Specifically, autoclaved SLA surfaces lost the characteristic increase
   in osteoblast differentiation seen on starting SLA surfaces, which was
   correlated with altered surface wettability and roughness. These data
   indicated that recleaned and resterilized Ti implant surfaces cannot be
   considered the same as the first surfaces in terms of surface properties
   and cell responses. Therefore, the reuse of Ti implants after
   resterilization may not result in the same tissue responses as found
   with never-before-implanted specimens. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The effects of thermal vibrations on X-ray powder diffraction patterns
   are discussed. Special considerations for extremely small crystallites
   are described, including the occurrence of surface and edge vibrational
   modes, and a restriction on the maximum phonon wavelength. In doing so,
   a complete temperature diffuse scattering (TDS) model is presented,
   which includes the influence of these features on: the DebyeWaller
   parameter; first-order TDS; and higher-order TDS terms. The importance
   of using an accurate TDS representation is studied as a function of
   temperature and crystallite size. It is found that a misrepresentation
   of the TDS for small crystallites can lead to an error in the determined
   DebyeWaller parameter on the order of 2040\% and a slight overestimation
   of the peak broadening. While the presented theory is primarily
   developed considering X-ray scattering, the same expressions are

Title = {{The Effects of a Three-Dimensional, Saddle-Shaped Annulus on Anterior
   and Posterior Leaflet Stretch and Regurgitation of the Tricuspid Valve}},

Abstract = {{Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is present in trace amounts or more in
   82-86\% of the population and is greater than mild in 14\% of the
   population. In severe cases, it can contribute to right heart failure
   and adversely affect mitral valve repair durability. One major cause of
   TR is the dilation of the tricuspid annulus, which alters the geometry
   of the annulus from a saddle-shape to a more planar profile. Another
   cause of TR is the displacement of the papillary muscles (PMs), which
   results from right ventricular dilation. The objective of this study was
   to identify the effect of a saddle-shaped annulus on native tricuspid
   leaflet stretch mechanics and TR. In addition, the effects of geometric
   alterations, including annular dilatation and PM displacement, on
   leaflet stretch was investigated. Fresh porcine tricuspid valves (TVs)
   (n = 8) were excised and sutured to an adjustable three-dimensional
   annulus plate (allowing for dilatation and saddle-shape) and three PM
   attachment rods. The valve was then placed in the in vitro Georgia Tech
   right heart simulator. Dual-camera photogrammetry, was used to quantify
   the stretch ratio experienced by the valve leaflets at peak systole for
   the following conditions: physiologically normal, 100\% annular
   dilatation, displaced PMs, and a combination of annular dilatation and
   PM displacement. In addition, a saddle and flat annulus were implemented
   for each of the four conditions. PM displacement was simulated by
   displacing all PMs by 10 mm in all directions (laterally, apically,
   posteriorly/anteriorly). The physiologically normal condition-normal
   annulus area, saddle-shaped annulus with PMs in a normal position, was
   used as a control. The results showed that the posterior leaflet
   exhibited significantly (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05)
   higher major and areal stretch ratios as compared to the anterior
   leaflet at peak systole for all conditions tested. No significant
   difference was seen in stretch when a flat annulus was compared to
   saddle for the anterior or posterior leaflet for normal or disease
   conditions. Investigation of the impact of disease found a significant
   increase (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.10) in stretch in the
   posterior leaflet with a combination of annular dilatation and PM
   displacement (2.01 +/- A 0.68) as compared to the normal condition with
   a saddle annulus (1.43 +/- A 0.20). In addition displacement of the PMs
   resulted in a significant (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01)
   reduction in TR, although the actual volume reduced was minimal (1.2
   mL). Stretch values were measured for the anterior and posterior leaflet
   under both physiologic and pathologic conditions for the first time.
   Further, these results provide an understanding of the effects of
   geometric parameters on valve mechanics and function, which may lead to
   improved TV repairs.}},

Abstract = {{To advance the knowledge of environmental fate of nanomaterials, we
   systematically investigated the dissolution of polymer-coated CdSe/ZnS
   quantum dots (QDs) under UV (254 nm) irradiation. The environmental
   effects (i.e., irradiation intensity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and
   humic acid), as well as the coating effects on dissolution kinetics of
   QDs were investigated. Our results showed that higher irradiation
   intensity and temperature increased ion release rates (Cd2+, SeO42-, and
   Zn2+), whereas the different polymer coatings varied the dissolution
   rates. The absence of dissolved oxygen inhibited the dissolution of QDs,
   and we further demonstrated that the dissolution was a photo-oxidative
   process involved superoxide radical formation. Humic acid had a twofold
   effect on dissolution due to its photosensitization and photoabsorption
   for UV irradiation. Finally, an empirical kinetic law was proposed to
   interpret the above environmental effects. This study lays groundwork to
   better understand the environmental fate of QDs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Multiple-symbol detection has recently caught attention in ultrawideband
   (UWB) communications because of its high performance without requiring
   explicit channel estimation. In this context, the generalized likelihood
   ratio test (GLRT) for multiple-symbol detection problem is developed to
   jointly detect multiple symbols, which exhibits considerable error
   performance improvement over transmitted reference transmissions
   methods. Unfortunately, the GLRT is a Boolean quadratic programming
   (BQP) problem, which is generally nondeterministic polynomial hard
   (NP-hard). In this paper, we propose two near-optimal detectors with
   polynomial complexity. The first detector performs semidefinite
   relaxation to approximately solve the BQP problem (called SDP-MSD). The
   second detector is based on a sphere-based relaxation of the BQP problem
   {[}we refer to this as modified unconstrained relaxation multiple-symbol
   detector (MUR-MSD)]. Both detectors achieve near-optimal performance,
   while the SDP-MSD performs slightly better than the MUR-MSD at the price
   of higher computational complexity. Furthermore, the MUR-MSD can be
   treated as a further nontight relaxation of SDP-MSD. Simulations are
   utilized to validate our findings and to demonstrate performance
   robustness to multiaccess interference.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling of device sizes has reduced gate oxide thickness to a few atomic
   layers, increasing the vulnerability of the gate oxide to breakdown.
   During breakdown, devices go through a gradual wearout process
   characterized by increased leakage. Using experimentally verified gate
   oxide breakdown models, a detailed analysis of the effect of progressive
   gate oxide breakdown on the performance of a conventional 6T SRAM cell
   is presented for 45-nm predictive technology. The DC margins (read,
   write, and retention) and access times (read and write) during wearout
   are analyzed, and a cell breakdown point due to degradation in each of
   these parameters is defined. A combination of these results is used to
   formulate a definition for the hard-breakdown point of a cell. An
   on-chip process, voltage, and temperature tolerant monitoring scheme is
   proposed to detect the gradual wearout of SRAM cells. The monitoring
   scheme enables the detection of impending cell failure, which in turn
   can trigger reconfiguration of the SRAM with redundant rows and/or
   columns prior to failure.}},

   interpolator achieved more than 16-dB additional spur suppression. In
   addition, the harmonics of the reference spur within a 104-MHz frequency
   offset, the location of the eighth harmonic of the reference spur, were
   dramatically suppressed. The prototype PLL was fully integrated in a
   0.18-mu m CMOS technology, which occupies a 670 mu m x 640 mu m active

   absorber was investigated. A tube bank consisting of four columns of six
   9.5 mm nominal OD, 0.292 m long tubes was installed in a shell that
   allowed heat and mass transfer measurements and optical access for flow
   visualization. This absorber was installed in a test facility consisting
   of all the components of a chiller, fabricated to obtain realistic
   operating conditions at the absorber to account for the influence of the
   other components in the system. Tests were conducted over desorber
   solution outlet concentrations of 5-40\% for three nominal absorber
   pressures of 150, 345 and 500 kPa, for solution flow rates of
   0.019-0.034 kg s(-1). Measurement and analysis techniques, heat transfer
   rates, and solution- and vapor-side heat and mass transfer coefficients
   are described. Trends in heat and mass transfer coefficients are
   discussed, highlighting the effects of solution flow rate and
   concentration, and absorber pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All

Abstract = {{Atherosclerotic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
   developed countries, and oxidized LDL (OxLDL) plays a key role in the
   formation, rupture, and subsequent thrombus formation in atherosclerotic
   plaques. In the current study, anti-mouse OxLDL polyclonal antibody and
   nonspecific IgG antibody were conjugated to polyethylene glycol-coated
   ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, and a
   carotid perivascular collar model in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice was
   imaged at 7.0 Tesla MRI before contrast administration and at 8 h and 24
   h after injection of 30 mg Fe/kg. The results showed MRI signal loss in
   the carotid atherosclerotic lesions after administration of targeted
   anti-OxLDL-USPIO at 8 h and 24 h, which is consistent with the presence
   of the nanoparticles in the lesions. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the
   colocalization of the OxLDL/macrophages and iron oxide nanoparticles.
   The nonspecific IgG-USPIO, unconjugated USPIO nanoparticles, and
   competitive inhibition groups had limited signal changes (p < 0.05).Jlr
   This report shows that anti-OxLDL-USPIO nanoparticles can be used to
   directly detect OxLDL and image atherosclerotic lesions within 24 h of
   nanoparticle administration and suggests a strategy for the therapeutic
   evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques in vivo.-Wen, S., D-F. Liu, Z.

Abstract = {{Silica sol doped with organic pigment was prepared by hydrolyzing
   tetraethoxysilane with a basic catalyst via dispersing pigment in silica
   sol. The colloidal properties of SiO2/pigment hybrid sol and its
   deposited film were investigated. The presence of pigment in
   SiO2/pigment hybrid sol affects the Zeta potential, particle size and
   surface tension compared to the silica sol without pigment. The
   SiO2/pigment hybrid sol exhibited good dispersion stability in the
   centrifuge process. The maximum absorption wavelength was consistent
   with that of the pigment disperse solution, indicating that the pigment
   in SiO2/pigment hybrid sol remained unchanged. Thermogravimetric
   analysis of the contents of organic component in silica sol and
   SiO2/pigment hybrid sol were conducted, and the differential value was
   ascribed to the weight of the pigment and the condensate of
   polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether (OP-10) and
   gamma-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH-560). The surface topography
   of SiO2/pigment hybrid silica film was characterized by AFM. The

Abstract = {{Objective: Our objective was to analyze 3-dimensional (3D) blood flow
   patterns within the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) using in vivo
   phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC MRI).
   Methods: Sixteen single-ventricle patients were prospectively recruited
   at 2 leading pediatric institutions for PC MRI evaluation of their
   Fontan pathway. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 8
   patients with an extracardiac (EC) TCPC, and group 2 comprised 8
   patients with a lateral tunnel (LT) TCPC. A coronal stack of 5 to 10
   contiguous PC MRI slices with 3D velocity encoding (5-9 ms resolution)
   was acquired and a volumetric flow field was reconstructed.
   Results: Analysis revealed large vortices in LT TCPCs and helical flow
   structures in EC TCPCs. On average, there was no difference between LT
   and EC TCPCs in the proportion of inferior vena cava flow going to the
   left pulmonary artery (43\% +/- 7\% vs 46\% +/- 5\%; P = .34). However,
   for EC TCPCs, the presence of a caval offset was a primary determinant
   of inferior vena caval flow distribution to the pulmonary arteries with
   a significant bias to the offset side.
   Conclusions: 3D flow structures within LT and EC TCPCs were
   reconstructed and analyzed for the first time using PC MRI. TCPC flow
   patterns were shown to be different, not only on the basis of LT or EC
   considerations, but with significant influence from the superior vena
   cava connection as well. This work adds to the ongoing body of research
   demonstrating the impact of TCPC geometry on the overall hemodynamic
   profile. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012; 143: 1108-16)}},

   degrees C and 80\% relative humidity (RH). Data show an effective water
   vapor transmission rate (WVTR), on the order of 10(-3) g/m(2)/day in the
   transient regime with a breakthrough time greater than 1400 h for seals
   1.5 mm wide and 0.3 mm thick. By changing the sealant architecture, the
   breakthrough time was increased with similar effective WVTRs. Finally,
   the sealant was applied to organic electrochromic devices, which

Abstract = {{The stability of a Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst in liquid water and aqueous
   solutions of 5 wt\% glycerol or sorbitol at 225 A degrees C is examined
   using a variety of physicochemical methods. It is demonstrated that the
   presence of glycerol and sorbitol significantly reduces the hydration of
   gamma-Al2O3 to form boehmite as compared to treatment in pure water. The
   stability against hydration increases with increasing carbon chain
   length. Treatment with polyol solutions also results in reduced
   agglomeration of supported metal particles. The prevention of boehmite
   formation and agglomeration of metal particles are attributed to the
   formation of carbonaceous species on the surface. In addition to these
   effects, the deposits block a considerable portion of active metal
   surface area. IR spectroscopic analysis indicates that dehydration
   reactions play an important role in the formation of the carbonaceous
   deposits. The present results illustrate that water and dissolved
   biomass compounds can strongly affect the stability of heterogeneous
   catalysts under reaction conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The primary challenge for an urban bus system is to maintain constant
   headways between successive buses. Most bus systems try to achieve this
   by adherence to a schedule; but this is undermined by the tendency of
   headways to collapse, so that buses travel in bunches. To counter this,
   we propose a new method of coordinating buses. Our method abandons the
   idea of a schedule and even any a priori target headway. Under our
   scheme headways are dynamically self-equalizing and the natural headway
   of the system tends to emerge spontaneously. Headways also become
   self-correcting in that after disturbances they reequalize without
   intervention by management or even awareness of the drivers.
   We report on a successful implementation to control a bus route in

Abstract = {{A microneedle patch coated with vaccine simplifies vaccination by using
   a patch-based delivery method and targets vaccination to the skin for
   superior immunogenicity compared to intramuscular injection. Previous
   studies of microneedles have demonstrated effective vaccination using
   freshly prepared microneedles, but the issue of long-term vaccine
   stability has received only limited attention. Here, we studied the
   long-term stability of microneedles coated with whole inactivated
   influenza vaccine guided by the hypothesis that crystallization and
   phase separation of the microneedle coating matrix damages influenza
   vaccine coated onto microneedles. In vitro studies showed that the
   vaccine lost stability as measured by hemagglutination activity in
   proportion to the degree of coating matrix crystallization and phase
   separation. Transmission electron microscopy similarly showed damaged
   morphology of the inactivated virus vaccine associated with
   crystallization. In vivo assessment of immune response and protective
   efficacy in mice further showed reduced vaccine immunogenicity after
   influenza vaccination using microneedles with crystallized or
   phase-separated coatings. This work shows that crystallization and phase
   separation of the dried coating matrix are important factors affecting
   long-term stability of influenza vaccine-coated microneedles. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32-33}},
Pages = {{134-154}},

Abstract = {{A mechanistic model of shock-wave-induced viscoplasticity is
   parameterized for three polycrystalline metals: Cu, Ni, and Al. The
   model is also extended to higher stress wave amplitudes by incorporating
   homogeneous dislocation nucleation within the constitutive framework.
   Steady shock waves are simulated to demonstrate the model and compare
   results to experimental data. Stress wave amplitudes of up to 30 GPa
   have been simulated in each metal; these stress waves generate strain
   rates of up to similar to 10(10) s(-1) in the shock front. Model results
   compare favorably with experimental velocity profiles, dynamic
   stress-strain curves, the Swegle-Grady scaling law, and non-invasive
   measurements of shear strength in the shocked state. Furthermore,
   simulated stress-strain-rate profiles exhibit points of
   self-intersection (loops) because the mobile and immobile dislocation
   densities have been assigned as internal state variables. Such loops,
   which have been observed in experiments, are not captured by flow
   functions that are based on a single monotonically-increasing internal
   state variable. Finally, the model of 6061-T6 Al alloy is revisited to
   ammend a prior conclusion regarding shear strength in the shocked state
   and the onset of homogeneous dislocation nucleation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Most applications of therapeutic ultrasound (US) for intracellular
   delivery of drugs, proteins, DNA/RNA and other compounds would benefit
   from efficient uptake of these molecules into large numbers of cells
   without killing cells in the process. In this study we tested the
   hypothesis that efficient intracellular uptake of molecules can be
   achieved with high cell viability after US exposure in vitro. A search
   of the literature for studies with quantitative data on uptake and
   viability yielded 26 published papers containing 898 experimental data
   points. Analysis of these studies showed that just 7.7\% of the data
   points corresponded to relatively efficient uptake (>50\% of cells
   exhibiting uptake). Closer examination of the data showed that use of
   Definity US contrast agent (as opposed to Optison) and elevated
   sonication temperature at 37 degrees C (as opposed to room temperature)
   were associated with high uptake, which we further validated through
   independent experiments carried out in this study. Although these
   factors contributed to high uptake, almost all data with efficient
   uptake were from studies that had not accounted for lysed cells when
   determining cell viability. Based on retrospective analysis of the data,
   we showed that not accounting for lysed cells can dramatically increase
   the calculated uptake efficiency. We further argue that if all the data
   considered in this study were re-analyzed to account for lysed cells,
   there would be essentially no data with efficient uptake. We therefore
   conclude that the literature does not support the hypothesis that
   efficient intracellular uptake of molecules can be achieved with high
   cell viability after US exposure in vitro, which poses a challenge to
   future applications of US that require efficient intracellular delivery.

Abstract = {{The demand for electric vehicles has inspired extensive efforts to
   develop solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for transportation. However, the
   high cost of hydrogen fueled SOFC systems and the deactivation of Ni-YSZ
   anodes in hydrocarbon fuels hinder the progress of SOFCs' development
   and commercialization. Here, we report a unique multi-functional anode
   for SOFCs that allows direct utilization of transportation fuels
   (iso-octane) without co-feeding O-2 and CO2, demonstrating a peak power
   density of similar to 0.6 W/cm(2) at 750 degrees C. The multi-functional
   anode is derived from a conventional NiO-YSZ anode with BaCO3
   modification in the anode support, creating a catalytically active
   conformal coating of BaZr1-xYxO3-delta (BZY) on YSZ and nano-islands of
   BaO on Ni surface, which greatly promote reforming of octane and
   oxidation of the reformed fuels. Further, the simple and cost-effective
   modification process can be readily adopted in the fabrication of the
   state-of-the-art NiO-YSZ supported cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CATENA}},

Abstract = {{Our goal is to develop a model capable to discern the response of a
   watershed to different erosion mechanisms. We propose a framework that
   integrates a geomorphic component into the physically-based and
   spatially distributed TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator
   (tRIBS) model. The coupled model simulates main erosive processes of
   hillslopes (raindrop impact detachment, overland flow entrainment, and
   diffusive processes) and channel (erosion and deposition due to the
   action of water flow). In addition to the spatially distributed, dynamic
   hydrologic variables, the model computes the sediment transport
   discharge and changes in elevation, which feedback to hydrological
   dynamics through local changes of terrain slope, aspect, and drainage
   network configuration. The model was calibrated for the Lucky Hills
   basin, a semi-arid watershed nested in the Walnut Gulch Experimental
   Watershed (Arizona, USA). It is demonstrated to be capable of
   reproducing main runoff and sediment yield events and accumulated
   volumes over the long term. The model was also used to study the
   response of two first-order synthetic basins representative of landforms
   dominated by fluvial and diffusive erosion processes to a 100-year long
   stationary climate. The analysis of the resultant slope-contributing
   area relationships for the two synthetic basins illustrates that the
   model is consistent with assumed principles of behavior and capable of
   reproducing the main mechanisms of erosion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Anisotropy in stress corrosion cracking of lean grade UNS S32101 and
   standard grade UNS S32205 hot rolled duplex stainless steels was
   evaluated in this study. Microstructures were characterised with
   stereology methods in three orthogonal orientations to quantify
   anisotropy in phase distribution. Constant extension rate tests were
   conducted in an autoclave at 2x10(-6) s(-1) in chloride containing
   alkaline sulphide solution at 170 degrees C. The maximum crack lengths
   and average crack densities were measured for the rolling longitudinal
   and transverse longitudinal orientations after stress corrosion cracking
   tests. Results indicate that stress corrosion crack initiation and
   growth are a strong function of the microstructure in each orientation.
   Maximum crack length and average crack density were maximum for the
   rolling longitudinal orientation. Crack initiation and growth were
   favoured along the transverse direction. Chlorides enhanced anisotropy
   in crack growth behaviour by facilitating crack initiation and crack
   coalescence along phase boundaries, which lead to more severe stress
   corrosion cracking in the alkaline sulphide environments that were
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{The master/worker (MW) paradigm can be used as an approach to parallel

   applications incur overheads not found in conventional PDES executions
   executing on tightly coupled machines. We introduce four optimization
   techniques in MW PDES systems on public resource and desktop grid
   infrastructures. Work unit caching, pipelined state updates, expedited
   message delivery, and adaptive work unit scheduling mechanisms in the
   context of MW PDES are described. These optimizations provide
   significant performance benefits when used in tandem. We present results
   showing that an optimized MW PDES system using these techniques can
   exhibit performance comparable to a traditional PDES system for queueing
   network and particle physics simulation applications while providing
   execution capability across metacomputing systems.}},

   118 to 166 S cm(-1) at 500-800 degrees C. The interfacial polarization
   resistances of an LSMCo cathode on YSZ electrolyte are smaller than
   those of an LSM cathode at 600-800 degrees C. The performance of a cell
   based on an LSMCo cathode is similar to 34\% higher than that based on
   an LSM cathode while maintaining comparable long-term stability,

   performance in the ionic liquid electrolyte with a stable discharge
   capacity of similar to 2000 mAh g(-1) and coulombic efficiency of 97\%
   after 50 cycles. However, the large internal stresses caused by the
   volumetric expansion of the Si during lithiation limits the long-term
   cycle life of the battery in both ionic and organic electrolytes due
   in-part to the repeated disruption and reformation of the solid
   electrolyte interface layer on the Si. In contrast, when the same Si
   nanowire electrode was cycled at relatively shallow discharges, similar
   to those of carbon anodes, 320 mAh g(-1), the battery showed better
   performance with cycle life greater than 650 cycles and coulombic

Title = {{Iterative Trust and Reputation Management Using Belief Propagation}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the first application of the belief
   propagation algorithm in the design and evaluation of trust and
   reputation management systems. We approach the reputation management
   problem as an inference problem and describe it as computing marginal
   likelihood distributions from complicated global functions of many
   variables. However, we observe that computing the marginal probability
   functions is computationally prohibitive for large-scale reputation
   systems. Therefore, we propose to utilize the belief propagation
   algorithm to efficiently (in linear complexity) compute these marginal
   probability distributions; resulting a fully iterative probabilistic and
   belief propagation-based approach (referred to as BP-ITRM). BP-ITRM
   models the reputation system on a factor graph. By using a factor graph,
   we obtain a qualitative representation of how the consumers (buyers) and
   service providers (sellers) are related on a graphical structure.
   Further, by using such a factor graph, the global functions factor into
   products of simpler local functions, each of which depends on a subset
   of the variables. Then, we compute the marginal probability distribution
   functions of the variables representing the reputation values (of the
   service providers) by message passing between nodes in the graph. We
   show that BP-ITRM is reliable in filtering out malicious/unreliable
   reports. We provide a detailed evaluation of BP-ITRM via analysis and
   computer simulations. We prove that BP-ITRM iteratively reduces the
   error in the reputation values of service providers due to the malicious
   raters with a high probability. Further, we observe that this
   probability drops suddenly if a particular fraction of malicious raters
   is exceeded, which introduces a threshold property to the scheme.
   Furthermore, comparison of BP-ITRM with some well-known and commonly
   used reputation management techniques (e. g., Averaging Scheme, Bayesian
   Approach, and Cluster Filtering) indicates the superiority of the
   proposed scheme in terms of robustness against attacks (e. g., ballot
   stuffing, bad mouthing). Finally, BP-ITRM introduces a linear complexity
   in the number of service providers and consumers, far exceeding the
   efficiency of other schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Different noise-reduction methods have been proposed in the literature
   for single and multiple-microphone applications. For binaural hearing
   aids, multiple-microphone noise-reduction methods offer two significant
   psycho-acoustical advantages with respect to the single-microphone
   methods. First, noise reduction strategies based on binaural processing
   (processing using the information received at the left and right ear)
   are more effective than using independent monaural processing because of
   the added information. Second, there is an user preference for noise
   reduction methods that preserve localization cues of both target and
   interfering signals. Although different multiple-microphone
   noise-reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature, only a
   small set is able to preserve the localization cues for both target and
   interfering signals. This paper proposes a binaural noise-reduction
   method that preserves the localization cues for both target and
   interfering signals. The proposed method is based on blind source
   separation (BSS) followed by a postprocessing technique inspired by a
   human auditory model. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed
   using objective and subjective measurements, and compared to existing
   binaural noise-reduction methods based on BSS and multichannel Wiener
   filter (MWF). Results show that for some scenarios and conditions, the
   proposed method outperforms on average the existing methods in terms of
   noise reduction and provides nearly similar sound quality.}},

   discrete element method simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Gas hydrate is a crystalline solid found within marine and subpermafrost
   sediments. While the presence of hydrates can have a profound effect on
   sediment properties, the stress-strain behavior of hydrate-bearing
   sediments is poorly understood due to inherent limitations in laboratory
   testing. In this study, we use numerical simulations to improve our
   understanding of the mechanical behavior of hydrate-bearing sands. The
   hydrate mass is simulated as either small randomly distributed bonded
   grains or as ``ripened hydrate{''} forming patchy saturation, whereby
   sediment clusters with 100\% pore-filled hydrate saturation are
   distributed within a hydrate-free sediment. Simulation results reveal
   that reduced sand porosity and higher hydrate saturation cause an
   increase in stiffness, strength, and dilative tendency, and the critical
   state line shifts toward higher void ratio and higher shear strength. In
   particular, the critical state friction angle increases in sands with
   patchy saturation, while the apparent cohesion is affected the most when
   the hydrate mass is distributed in pores. Sediments with patchy hydrate
   distribution exhibit a slightly lower strength than sediments with
   randomly distributed hydrate. Finally, hydrate dissociation under
   drained conditions leads to volume contraction and/or stress relaxation,
   and pronounced shear strains can develop if the hydrate-bearing sand is
   subjected to deviatoric loading during dissociation.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen limits leaf gas exchange, canopy development, and
   evapotranspiration in many ecosystems. In dryland ecosystems, it is
   unclear whether increased anthropogenic nitrogen inputs alter the widely
   recognized dominance of water and energy constraints on ecohydrology. We
   use observations from a factorial irrigation and fertilization
   experiment in a nitrogen-limited southern California annual grassland to
   explore this hypothesis. Our analysis shows growing season soil moisture
   and canopy-scale water vapor conductance are equivalent in control and
   fertilized plots. This consistency arises as fertilization-induced
   increases in leaf area index (LAI) are offset by reduced leaf area-based
   stomatal conductance, g(s). We interpret this as evidence of a hydraulic
   feedback between LAI, plant water status, and gs, not commonly
   implemented in evapotranspiration models. These results support the
   notion that canopy physiology and structure are coordinated in
   water-limited ecosystems to maintain a transpiration flux tightly
   controlled by hydraulic constraints in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere
   pathway. Citation: Parolari, A. J., M. L. Goulden, and R. L. Bras

Abstract = {{The seasonal and spatial variations of source contributions of 112
   composite fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected in the
   Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Study (SEARCH)
   monitoring network during 2001-2005 using molecular marker-based
   chemical mass balance (CMB-MM) model were determined. The lowest PM2.5
   concentration occurs in January with higher values in warm months
   (maxima in July at four inland sites versus October at the coastal
   sites). Sulfate shows a similar pattern and plays a primary role in
   PM2.5 seasonality. Carbonaceous material (organic matter plus EC)
   exhibits less seasonality, but more spatial variations between the
   inland and coastal sites. Compared with the data at coastal sites,
   source attributions of diesel exhaust, gasoline exhaust, other organic
   matter (other OM), secondary sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in PM2.5
   mass at inland sites are higher. The difference in source attributions
   of wood combustion, meat cooking, vegetative detritus, and road dust
   among the eight sites is not significant. Contributions of eight primary
   sources to fine OC are wood burning (17 +/- 19\%), diesel exhaust (9
   +/-4\%), gasoline exhaust (5 +/- 7\%), meat cooking (5 +/- 5\%), road
   dust (2 +/- 3\%), vegetative detritus (2 +/- 2\%), cigarette smoke (2
   +/- 2\% at four urban sites), and coke production (2 +/- 1\% only at
   BHM). Primary and secondary sources explain 82-100\% of measured PM2.5
   mass at the eight sites, including secondary ionic species (SO42-, NH4+,
   and NO3-; 41.4 +/- 5.7\%), identified OM (24.9 +/- 11.3\%), ``other
   OM{''} (unexplained OM, 23.3 +/- 10.3\%), and ``other mass{''} (11.4 +/-
   9.6\%). Vehicle exhaust from both diesel and gasoline contributes the
   lowest fraction to PM2.5 mass in July and higher fractions at BHM and
   JST than other sites. Wood combustion, in contrast, contributes
   significantly to a larger fraction in winter than in summer. Road dust
   shows relatively high levels in July and April across the eight sites,
   while minor sources such as meat cooking and other sources (e. g.,
   vegetative detritus, coke production, and cigarette smoke) show
   relatively small seasonal and spatial variations in the SEARCH

Abstract = {{Recently, organic diodes have attracted great research interest because
   of their unique applications in flexible electronics. Electronic paper
   is one of the most attractive organic electronic devices. Hereby, we
   report a transparent, flexible, ionic diode paper made of two oppositely
   charged microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) sublayers. The current
   rectification ratio is around 15 at +/- 5 V and exhibits good
   repeatability at room temperature. Instead of forming a depletion region
   to rectify current, this paper diode uses asymmetric charge distribution
   to selectively control the ion diffusion direction. The asymmetric
   charge distribution inside the diode paper can selectively transport
   cations and anions under positive and negative bias, to allow an
   electric current to pass in one direction while being blocked in the
   opposite direction. Although the mechanism is quite different from
   semiconductor-based p-n junction, the phenomenon turns out to be very
   similar. It was found that the moisture content, thickness of paper, and
   scanning frequency will influence the performance of the diode paper.
   All these factors are closely related to the ionic characteristics of
   the diode.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to quickly store and deliver a significant amount of
   electrical energy at ultralow temperatures is critical for the
   energy-efficient operation of high altitude aircraft and spacecraft,
   exploration of natural resources in polar regions and extreme altitudes,
   and astronomical observatories exposed to ultralow temperatures.
   Commercial high-power electrochemical capacitors fail to operate at
   temperatures below 40 degrees C. According to conventional wisdom,
   mesoporous electrochemical capacitor electrodes with pores large enough
   to accommodate fully solvated ions are needed for sufficiently rapid ion
   transport at lower temperatures. It is demonstrated that strictly
   microporous carbon electrodes with much higher volumetric capacitance
   can be efficiently used at temperatures as low as 70 degrees C. The
   critical parameters, with respect to electrolyte properties and
   electrode porosity and microstructure, needed for achieving both rapid
   ion transport and efficient ion electroadsorption in porous carbons are
   discussed. As an example, the fabrication of an electrochemical
   capacitor with an outstanding performance at temperatures as low as 60
   and 70 degrees C is demonstrated. At such low temperatures the
   capacitance of the synthesized electrodes is up to 123 F g-1 (similar to
   76 F cm-3), which is 50100\% higher than that of the most common
   commercial electrochemical capacitor electrode at room temperature. At
   60 degrees C selected cells based on similar to 0.2 mm electrodes
   exhibited characteristic chargedischarge time constants of less than 9
   s, which is faster than the majority of commercial devices at room
   temperature. The achieved combination of high energy and power densities
   at such ultralow temperatures is unprecedented and extremely promising
   for the advancement of energy storage systems.}},

Abstract = {{C. elegans is an excellent model system for studying neuroscience using
   genetics because of its relatively simple nervous system, sequenced
   genome, and the availability of a large number of transgenic and mutant
   strains. Recently, microfluidic devices have been used for
   high-throughput genetic screens, replacing traditional methods of
   manually handling C. elegans. However, the orientation of nematodes
   within microfluidic devices is random and often not conducive to
   inspection, hindering visual analysis and overall throughput. In
   addition, while previous studies have utilized methods to bias head and
   tail orientation, none of the existing techniques allow for orientation
   along the dorso-ventral body axis. Here, we present the design of a
   simple and robust method for passively orienting worms into lateral body
   positions in microfluidic devices to facilitate inspection of
   morphological features with specific dorso-ventral alignments. Using
   this technique, we can position animals into lateral orientations with
   up to 84\% efficiency, compared to 21\% using existing methods. We
   isolated six mutants with neuronal development or neurodegenerative
   defects, showing that our technology can be used for on-chip analysis
   and high-throughput visual screens.}},

Abstract = {{Organic and printed electronics technologies require conductors with a
   work function that is sufficiently low to facilitate the transport of
   electrons in and out of various optoelectronic devices. We show that
   surface modifiers based on polymers containing simple aliphatic amine
   groups substantially reduce the work function of conductors including
   metals, transparent conductive metal oxides, conducting polymers, and
   graphene. The reduction arises from physisorption of the neutral
   polymer, which turns the modified conductors into efficient
   electron-selective electrodes in organic optoelectronic devices. These
   polymer surface modifiers are processed in air from solution, providing
   an appealing alternative to chemically reactive low-work function
   metals. Their use can pave the way to simplified manufacturing of
   low-cost and large-area organic electronic technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study the hydrolysis
   reaction of (MO2)(n) (M = Zr, Hf, n = 1-4) nanoclusters in the ground
   singlet and first triplet states. The reactions for singlet n = 1 were
   benchmarked at the CCSD(T) level of theory. The reactions of H2O with
   the metal site having an M=O bond and/or M-O bonds as well as H transfer
   to both terminal =O atoms and bridge -O atoms have been studied. The
   partial charge on M increases as the M=O bonds are replaced with M-OH
   bonds. The first H2O adsorption (physisorption) energies for these MO2
   nanoclusters are calculated to be -20 to -30 kcal/mol for the singlet
   state and -15 to -48 kcal/mol for the triplet state. These physisorption
   energies depend on the cluster size and the adsorption site, consistent
   with existing experimental and computational studies. The first
   hydrolysis (dissociative chemisorption) reaction energies of the MO2
   nanoclusters are calculated to have a much broader range, -30 to -80
   kcal/mol for the singlet states and -30 to -100 kcal/mol for the triplet
   states. Steric effects play an important role in determining the
   physisorption and chemisorption energies, especially for the trimers and
   tetramers. The potential energy surfaces for hydrolysis in both the
   singlet and triplet states are calculated. The calculated Lewis
   acidities (fluoride affinities) correlate with the hydrolysis properties
   of the nanoclusters. Our calculations show that H2O readily reacts with
   both the singlet and triplet states of the MO, nanoclusters to form the
   hydroxides. The reaction barriers are generally less than 10 kcal/mol
   for the singlet states, and because the H2O physisorption energies are
   large, the barriers occur below the (MO2)(n) asymptote.}},

Abstract = {{Photoinduced charge transfer at an electron donor/acceptor interface is
   one of the most crucial processes in determining the power conversion
   efficiency of organic solar cell devices. Here, we address exciton
   dissociation and charge carrier trapping at poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction
   interfaces electrically using a field effect transistor (FET). With a
   P3HT/PCBM composite film, we elucidated exciton dissociation and charge
   carrier recombination assisted by localized electronic states at the
   P3HT/PCBM interface via photoinduced threshold voltage shift
   measurements with respect to wavelength using FETs in combination with
   organic solar cell devices. Interestingly, the combination of light
   coupled with a significant quantity of PCBM within the film was required
   to observe ambipolar charge transport in P3HT/PCBM FETs. This phenomenon
   was addressed by filling of electron traps associated with PCBM under
   illumination and formation of the conducting pathways for both electrons
   and holes. A high density of carrier traps at the interface suggested by
   the FET results was confirmed in light intensity dependent short-circuit
   current (J(sc)) and open-circuit voltage (V-oc) measurements using solar
   cell devices. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The shock compression response of alpha `'-Fe16N2 nanoparticles is
   studied in order to evaluate the thermo-mechanical stability of the
   alpha `' phase under shock loading. Shock compression experiments were
   performed using the parallel plate impact gas gun set up at velocities
   near 850 m/s. The experiments were performed at -21 degrees C and -126
   degrees C in order to minimize temperature excursions and thereby
   determine the thermal effects on the phase stability. The alpha
   `'-Fe16N2 phase is observed to partially decompose into alpha-Fe and

   temperature produces a higher percentage of gamma' phase in addition to
   the gamma `'-Fe50N50 phase. The pressure-volume-temperature response of
   the material is modeled using the dynamic mechanical properties of high
   nitrogen steel. The model is then used to evaluate the temperature
   excursions and their effect on the phase transitions observed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Dense BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY) thin membranes are successfully
   fabricated on porous NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (NiO-BZCY) anode
   substrates by a dip-coating process after sintered at 1450 degrees C.
   The NiO-BZCY anode substrates are prepared by phase inversion method
   based on in-situ reaction, showing a special asymmetrical structure with
   a porous finger-like layer and a sponge-like layer. Single cells with
   Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SSC-SDC) as cathodes are
   assembled and tested. The open circuit voltages (OCVs) of a cell with a
   25-mu m-thick BZY membrane are 0.95, 0.97, and 1.01 Vat 650, 600, and
   550 degrees C, respectively, indicating that the BZY electrolyte
   membrane is sufficiently dense. Meanwhile, the corresponding maximum
   power densities of the cell are 70, 55, and 34 mW cm(-2). The results
   demonstrated that dip-coating process is an effective method for
   fabricating dense BZY electrolyte membranes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Influenza infection represents a major socio-economic burden worldwide.
   Novel delivery methods can render influenza vaccination easier and more
   acceptable by the public, and importantly confer protection equal or
   superior to that induced by conventional systemic administration. An
   attractive target for vaccine delivery is the skin. Recent studies have
   demonstrated improved immune responses after transdermal delivery of
   inactivated influenza virus with microneedle patches. Here we show that
   immunization with a licensed influenza subunit vaccine coated on metal
   microneedles can activate both humoral and cellular arms of the immune
   response and confer improved long-term protection in the mouse model
   when compared to the conventional systemic route of delivery. These
   results demonstrate the promising potential of microneedle delivery of
   licensed influenza subunit vaccines, that could be beneficial in
   increasing vaccine coverage and protection and reducing
   influenza-related mortality worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{We use a systematic approach that combines experimental X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and computational modeling based on molecular
   mechanics and two-dimensional XRD simulations to develop a detailed
   model of the molecular-scale packing structure of poly(2,5-bis
   (3-tetradecylthiophene-2-yl)thieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT-C-14)
   films. Both uniaxially and biaxially aligned films are used in this
   comparison and lead to an improved understanding of the molecular-scale
   orientation and crystal structure. We then examine how individual
   polymer components (i.e., conjugated backbone and alkyl side chains)
   contribute to the complete diffraction pattern, and how modest changes
   to a particular component orientation (e.g., backbone or side-chain
   tilt) influence the diffraction pattern. The effects on the polymer
   crystal structure of varying the alkyl side-chain length from C-12 to
   C-14 and C-16 are also studied. The accurate determination of the
   three-dimensional polymer structure allows us to examine the PBTTT
   electronic band structure and intermolecular electronic couplings
   (transfer integrals) as a function of alkyl side-chain length. This
   combination of theoretical and experimental techniques proves to be an
   important tool to help establish the relationship between the structural
   and electronic properties of polymer thin films.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanocubes (AgNCs), 60 nm, have four extinction surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) peaks. The finite difference time domain (FDTD)
   simulation method is used to assign the absorption and scattering peaks
   and also to calculate the plasmon field intensity for AgNCs. Because
   AgNCs have a highly symmetric cubic shape, there is a uniform
   distribution of the plasmon field around them, and they are thus
   sensitive to asymmetric dielectric perturbations. When the dielectric
   medium around a nanoparticle is changed anisotropically, either by
   placing the particle on a substrate or by coating it asymmetrically with
   a solvent, the plasmon field is distorted, and the plasmonic absorption
   and scattering spectra could shift differently. For the 60 nm AgNC, we
   found that the scattering resonance peak shifted more than the
   absorption peak. This changes the extinction bandwidth of these
   overlapping absorption and scattering bands, and consequently the figure
   of merit of the nanoparticle, as a localized SPR sensor, no longer has a
   constant value.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology, mechanical properties, and permeability of
   hydrogen-bonded layer-by-layer (LbL) microcapsule shells assembled on
   cubic CdCO3 cores have been studied in comparison with traditional
   shells assembled on spherical SiO2 cores. We observed that the
   morphology of LbL shells is dramatically affected by the different
   release processes with highly porous and softened LbL shells as a result
   of the intense CO2 gas formation and ion release during the removal of
   cubic CdCO3 cores. A substantial increase in porosity is reflected in a
   dramatic change in the mesh size of LbL shells, from 2 nm for spherical
   capsules to above 35 rim for cubic capsules. Shells also possess
   enhanced permeability with a many fold increase in diffusion coefficient
   for dextran molecules and enhanced softening with the elastic modulus
   dropping by almost an order of magnitude for cubic capsules. These
   dramatic changes in shell morphology, porosity, permeability, and
   stiffness, observed in this study for the first time, are all important
   for the intelligent projection of controlled loading and unloading
   behavior of microcontainers with different shapes and composition, a
   component usually overlooked in current studies.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of many biopharmaceuticals, including protein- and gene-based
   therapies, has been limited by the need for better methods of delivery
   into cells within tissues. Here, intracellular delivery of molecules and
   transfection with plasmid DNA by electroporation is presented using a
   novel microneedle electrode array designed for the targeted treatment of
   skin and other tissue surfaces. The microneedle array is molded out of
   polylactic acid. Electrodes and circuitry required for electroporation
   are applied to the microneedle array surface by a new metal-transfer
   micromolding method. The microneedle array maintains mechanical
   integrity after insertion into pig cadaver skin and is able to
   electroporate human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Quantitative
   measurements show that increasing electroporation pulse voltage
   increases uptake efficiency of calcein and bovine serum albumin, whereas
   increasing pulse length has lesser effects over the range studied.
   Uptake of molecules by up to 50\% of cells and transfection of 12\% of
   cells with a gene for green fluorescent protein is demonstrated at high
   cell viability. It is concluded that the microneedle electrode array is
   able to electroporate cells, resulting in intracellular uptake of
   molecules, and has potential applications to improve intracellular
   delivery of proteins, DNA, and other biopharmaceuticals.}},

Abstract = {{T cell-dependent B-cell responses decline with age, suggesting defective
   CD4 T-cell function. CD4 memory T cells from individuals older than 65 y
   displayed increased and sustained transcription of the dual-specific
   phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) that shortened expression of CD40-ligand (CD40L)
   and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) (both P < 0.001) and decreased
   production of IL-4, IL-17A, and IL-21 (all P < 0.001) after in vitro
   activation. In vivo after influenza vaccination, activated CD4 T cells
   from elderly individuals had increased DUSP4 transcription (P = 0.002),
   which inversely correlated with the expression of CD40L (r = 0.65, P =
   0.002), ICOS (r = 0.57, P = 0.008), and IL-4 (r = 0.66, P = 0.001). In
   CD4 KO mice reconstituted with DUSP4 OT-II T cells, DUSP4 had a negative
   effect on the expansion of antigen-specific B cells (P = 0.003) and the
   production of ovaspecific antibodies (P = 0.03) after immunization.
   Silencing of DUSP4 in memory CD4 T cells improved CD40L (P < 0.001),
   IL-4 (P = 0.007), and IL-21 (P = 0.04) expression significantly more in
   the elderly than young adults. Consequently, the ability of CD4 memory T
   cells to support B-cell differentiation that was impaired in the elderly
   (P = 0.004) was restored. Our data suggest that increased DUSP4
   expression in activated T cells in the elderly in part accounts for
   defective adaptive immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{The linear and nonlinear optical properties of Ag/Au bilayer metallic
   thin films with a total thickness of around 20 nm and with different
   Ag/Au mass-thickness ratios were studied. This study shows that the
   spectral dispersion of the effective refractive index of bilayer films
   can be tuned by controlling the mass-thickness ratio between Au and Ag.
   Improvement of the figure-of-merit for potential plasmonic applications
   and linear optical filters in the visible spectral range are reported
   and discussed. The nonlinear optical properties of bilayer metal films
   studied using femtosecond white-light continuum pump-probe experiments
   are also shown to be tunable with this ratio. The nonlinear change of
   optical path length is extracted from the pump-probe data and agrees
   with simulated values derived from a combination of the two-temperature
   model, describing the ultrafast electron heating dynamics, and a
   physical model that describes the dielectric permittivity of Au as a
   function of electron and lattice temperature. (C) 2012 Optical Society

Title = {{Universal Sequence Replication, Reversible Polymerization and Early
   Functional Biopolymers: A Model for the Initiation of Prebiotic Sequence
   Evolution}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Many models for the origin of life have focused on understanding how
   evolution can drive the refinement of a preexisting enzyme, such as the
   evolution of efficient replicase activity. Here we present a model for
   what was, arguably, an even earlier stage of chemical evolution, when
   polymer sequence diversity was generated and sustained before, and
   during, the onset of functional selection. The model includes regular
   environmental cycles (e.g. hydration-dehydration cycles) that drive
   polymers between times of replication and functional activity, which
   coincide with times of different monomer and polymer diffusivity.
   Template-directed replication of informational polymers, which takes
   place during the dehydration stage of each cycle, is considered to be
   sequence-independent. New sequences are generated by spontaneous polymer
   formation, and all sequences compete for a finite monomer resource that
   is recycled via reversible polymerization. Kinetic Monte Carlo
   simulations demonstrate that this proposed prebiotic scenario provides a
   robust mechanism for the exploration of sequence space. Introduction of
   a polymer sequence with monomer synthetase activity illustrates that
   functional sequences can become established in a preexisting pool of
   otherwise non-functional sequences. Functional selection does not
   dominate system dynamics and sequence diversity remains high, permitting
   the emergence and spread of more than one functional sequence. It is
   also observed that polymers spontaneously form clusters in simulations
   where polymers diffuse more slowly than monomers, a feature that is
   reminiscent of a previous proposal that the earliest stages of life
   could have been defined by the collective evolution of a system-wide
   cooperation of polymer aggregates. Overall, the results presented
   demonstrate the merits of considering plausible prebiotic polymer
   chemistries and environments that would have allowed for the rapid
   turnover of monomer resources and for regularly varying monomer/polymer
   diffusivities.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the anti-ultraviolet property, anti-bacterial
   performance, color strength and color fastness of cellulose substrates,
   a new strategy is presented for multilayer Si-Ti-Si color deposition
   through layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly on a cellulose fabric
   surface. Alkaline SiO2, acidic TiO2 and cationic SiO2 sols were applied
   to the fiber surface successively in an order to maximize the electronic
   interaction. Si-O-Ti bonds were formed due to interlayer interaction.
   After coating, the color strength (K/S) of the fiber showed moderate
   improvement, whereas the color fastness to rubbing was enhanced
   significantly. In addition, the coated fabric exhibited drastic
   enhancement in anti-ultraviolet radiation transmission and anti-bacteria
   characteristics. The improvements of these properties were due to the
   physical and chemical properties of these sols coatings, and the
   mechanisms were studied by FTIR-ATR spectra and SEM analysis. Although
   the lighting fastness and the style of the coated fabric are decreased
   slightly, the washability is improved effectively and the breaking
   strength of the coated cellulose fabric is not damaged. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Tricuspid valve (TV) leaflets, papillary muscles (PM), and tendinous
   chords must work together to ensure proper coaptation. Alterations in
   valvular mechanics, including chordal forces, may lead to improper
   coaptation resulting in tricuspid regurgitation. Little is known about
   TV mechanics as right-sided heart diseases have been overlooked. We
   sought to fill this gap by understanding the role of TV strut chords
   with the objective to understand how strut chordal force varies
   depending on papillary muscle (PM) origin and leaflet attachment in the
   normal state. Additionally we investigated how these forces are altered
   with abnormal geometry. Porcine TVs (n=18) were studied in a right-heart
   simulator capable of reproducing physiological and pathological
   conditions. Miniature force transducers were placed on strut chords to
   measure forces throughout the cardiac cycle. In the normal state,
   chordal force depended upon PM attachment in which chords branching from
   the septal PM (SPM) carried significantly less force compared to those
   branching from the anterior PM (APM) (p <= 0.05). Annular dilatation
   resulted in significant increase in chordal force (p <= 0.05) on all
   strut chords. Severe PM displacement led to increased chordal force in
   chords attaching the APM to the posterior leaflet as well as chords
   attaching the PPM to the septal leaflet. Elevated chordal force due to
   isolated annular dilatation was further increased only with addition of
   apical displacement of the APM. These results provide initial knowledge
   of TV chordal force mechanics and may be applied to future studies on TV
   repair techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organoclays synthesized from single chain quaternary ammonium cations
   (QAC) ((CH3)(3)NR+) exhibit different mechanisms for the sorption of
   nonpolar organic compounds as the length of the carbon chain is
   increased. The interaction between a nonpolar sorbate and an organoclay
   intercalated with small QACs has been demonstrated to be surface
   adsorption, while-partitioning is the dominant mechanism in clays
   intercalated with long chain surfactants. This study presents the
   results of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation performed to examine the
   sorption mechanisms of benzene in the interlayer of three organoclays
   with chain lengths ranging from 1 to 16 carbons: tetramethylammonium
   (TMA) clay; decyltrimethylammonium (DTMA) clay; and
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) clay. The basis of the overall
   simulation was a combined force field of ClayFF and CVFF. In the
   simulations, organic cations were intercalated and benzene molecules
   were introduced to the interlayer, followed by whole system NPT and NVT
   time integration. Trajectories of all the species were recorded after
   the system reached equilibrium and subsequently analyzed. Simulation
   results confirmed that the arrangement of the surfactant; controlled the
   sorption mechanism of organoclays. Benzene molecules were observed to
   interact directly with the clay surface in the presence of TMA cations,
   but tended to interact with the aliphatic chain of the HDTMA cation in
   the interlayer. The simulation provided insight into the nature of the
   adsorption/partitioning mechanisms in organoclays, and explained
   experimental observations of decreased versus increased uptake
   capacities as a function of increasing total organic carbon (TOC) for
   TMA clay and HDTMA clay, respectively. The transition of sorption
   mechanisms was also quantified with simulation of DTMA clay, with a
   chain length between that of TMA and HDTMA. Furthermore, this study
   suggested that at the molecular level, the controlling factor for the
   ultimate sorption capacity is available surface sites in the case of TMA
   clay, and density of aliphatic chains within the interlayer space for
   HDTMA clay.}},

Title = {{Hygroscopicity and composition of California CCN during summer 2010}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{We present an overview and analysis of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
   sampled in California by a NOAA WP-3D aircraft during the 2010 CalNex
   project. Four distinct geographical regions are characterized, including
   the Los Angeles basin, the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, and the
   eastern Pacific Ocean west of southern California. Median size
   distributions in the Central Valley were unimodal (D-g similar to 25 nm)
   with a larger fraction of organic species and smaller fraction of
   nitrate species in the Sacramento Valley aerosol than in the San Joaquin
   Valley aerosol. Size distributions in the Los Angeles basin and marine
   outflow were bimodal (geometric mean diameter, D-g similar to 30, 90-100
   nm) with similar organic fractions and some replacement of nitrate with
   sulfate in the marine outflow. Both fine particle and CCN concentrations
   were found to decrease rapidly above the planetary boundary layer
   (similar to 2 km altitude), with CCN concentrations in the boundary
   layer ranging from similar to 10(2)-10(4) cm(-3) STP, while fine
   particle concentrations (0.004-1 mu m diameters) ranged from similar to
   10(3)-10(5) cm(-3) STP. The CCN-active number fraction varied between
   0-100\% in the Los Angeles Basin and Marine Outflow, but was
   substantially lower (0-40\%) in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys.
   Values of the hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, inferred from the CCN
   measurements varied from 0.1-0.25, with the highest values in the marine
   outflow and the lowest values in the Sacramento Valley. The k values
   agreed well with the predictions based on size-resolved aerosol
   composition, but were overpredicted by almost twofold when size-averaged
   composition was used. CCN closure was assessed for simplified
   compositional and mixing state assumptions, and it was found that
   assuming the aerosol to be internally mixed overpredicted CCN
   concentrations by 30-75\% for all air mass types except within the
   Sacramento Valley, where good closure (overprediction < 10\%) was
   achieved by assuming insoluble organics. Assuming an externally-mixed
   aerosol fraction or incorporating size-resolved composition data
   improved closure in the other three regions, consistent with the bimodal
   nature of the aerosol size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, birch xylan was deposited onto elementally chlorine free
   (ECF) bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp, and the corresponding changes in
   physical properties were determined. An aqueous 5\% birch xylan solution
   at pH 9 was added to 5 wt\% slurry of bleached kraft eucalyptus fibers,
   with stirring at 70 degrees C for 15 min after which the pH was adjusted
   to 5-6. The xylan enriched fibers were isolated by filtration and used
   for physical testing. A 1.15 wt\% adsorption of birch xylan on the kraft
   fibers at 8\% xylan addition increased the tensile index, strain and
   tensile energy absorption values by similar to 10\%, while the burst
   index increased by 20.15\%. The tear index increased by 2.55\% with the
   adsorption of 0.87 wt\% birch xylan on the eucalyptus kraft pulp at 3\%
   xylan addition. The pulp beatability was also improved by adding birch
   xylan. The surface morphology of the unmodified and modified pulp
   samples were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping
   mode. The analysis revealed the differences in the fine structure of
   fibers which showed micrometer-sized xylan structures spreading over the
   fiber surfaces. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{411-428}},

Abstract = {{The industry foundation classes (IFC) data schema is generic, designed
   to support the full range of model exchanges needed in the construction
   industry. For any particular working exchange for some subdomain of
   building construction, a set of model view definitions (MVD) is required
   to specify exactly what information should be exchanged, and in what
   form and structure the IFC entities are to be used. Defining model view
   definitions requires principle decisions and workarounds because the IFC
   itself does not address a number of semantic issues comprehensively.
   Some of the issues identified and discussed include the typing of
   objects, instances, geometry, relationships, and rules, which are
   supported in the IFC schema, and the complexities of exchanging such
   information accurately between applications. This paper advances the
   idea of MVD Concepts as an object-oriented and modular mechanism for
   embedding semantic meaning in model views. We conclude that although the
   IFC product model schema is richly expressive, it lacks formal
   definition of its entities, attributes, and relationships. To achieve
   standardized and re-usable model views, further research towards a
   modular and logical framework based on formal specification of IFC
   concepts is recommended. This research is expected to impact the overall
   interoperability of applications in the building information modeling
   realm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Construction activities performed by workers are usually repetitive and
   physically demanding. Execution of such tasks in awkward postures can
   strain their body parts and can result in fatigue, injuries or in severe
   cases permanent disabilities. In view of this, it is essential to train
   workers, before the commencement of any construction activity.
   Furthermore, traditional worker monitoring methods are tedious,
   inefficient and are carried out manually whereas, an automated approach,
   apart from monitoring, can yield valuable information concerning
   work-related behavior of worker that can be beneficial for worker
   training in a virtual reality world. Our research work focuses on
   developing an automated approach for posture estimation and
   classification using a range camera for posture analysis and
   categorizing it as ergonomic or non-ergonomic. Using a range camera,
   first we classify worker's pose to determine whether a worker is
   `standing', `bending', `sitting', or `crawling' and then estimate the
   posture of the worker using OpenNI middleware to get the body joint
   angles and spatial locations. A predefined set of rules is then
   formulated to use this body posture information to categorize tasks as
   ergonomic or non-ergonomic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses transient processes in natural gas pipelines. The
   method of characteristics (MOC) is applied for the analysis of two
   transient categories, where the governing one-dimensional, hyperbolic
   conservation equations are linearized and solved without neglecting any
   of their term. First, we present a parametric study of the pressurized
   flow encountered when pipelines are utilized for the transportation or
   the temporary storage of natural gas. The non-ideal compressibility of
   natural gas is included in the model and its impact on the
   thermo-hydraulic processes is elucidated. Second, we model the
   hydrodynamics of a pipeline whose downstream boundary is a periodic
   discharge rate. The results show that, in response to these boundary
   conditions, the pressure distribution in the pipeline also undergoes
   periodic variations. Furthermore, our simulation results confirm the
   usefulness of MOC for numerical simulation of flow phenomena in
   pipelines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have introduced the concept of interphase and revised classical
   micromechanics to predict the effective elastic properties of
   heterogeneous materials containing nano-inhomogeneities. An interphase
   is described as an additional phase between the matrix and inhomogeneity
   whose constitutive properties are derived from atomistic simulations and
   then incorporated in a micromechanics model to compute effective
   properties of nanocomposites. This scale transition approach bridges the
   gap between discrete atomic level interactions and continuum mechanics.
   An advantage of this approach is that it combines atomistic with
   continuum models that consider inhomogeneity and interphase morphology.
   It thereby enables us to account simultaneously for both the shape and
   the anisotropy of a nano-inhomogeneity and interphase at the continuum
   level when we compute material's overall properties. In so doing, it
   frees us from making any assumptions about the interface characteristics
   between matrix and the nano-inhomogeneity. (C) 2012 Published by

   strength by 15.7\%. The increase in the carboxyl group content of OCC
   laccase or Lac-HBT treated pulp led to the increase in the swelling

Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{945-972}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Joint Variable Spatial Downscaling (JVSD), a new statistical technique
   for downscaling gridded climatic variables, is developed to generate
   high resolution gridded datasets for regional watershed modeling and
   assessments. The proposed approach differs from previous statistical
   downscaling methods in that multiple climatic variables are downscaled
   simultaneously and consistently to produce realistic climate
   projections. In the bias correction step, JVSD uses a differencing
   process to create stationary joint cumulative frequency statistics of
   the variables being downscaled. The functional relationship between
   these statistics and those of the historical observation period is
   subsequently used to remove GCM bias. The original variables are
   recovered through summation of bias corrected differenced sequences. In
   the spatial disaggregation step, JVSD uses a historical analogue
   approach, with historical analogues identified simultaneously for all
   atmospheric fields and over all areas of the basin under study. Analysis
   and comparisons are performed for 20th Century Climate in Coupled Models
   (20C3M), broadly available for most GCMs. The results show that the
   proposed downscaling method is able to reproduce the sub-grid climatic
   features as well as their temporal/spatial variability in the historical
   periods. Comparisons are also performed for precipitation and
   temperature with other statistical and dynamic downscaling methods over
   the southeastern US and show that JVSD performs favorably. The
   downscaled sequences are used to assess the implications of GCM
   scenarios for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin as part
   of a comprehensive climate change impact assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, mediation-aided composition has been widely adopted when
   dealing with incompatibilities of services. However, existing approaches
   suffer from state space explosion in compatibility verification and
   cannot automatically generate the BPEL code. This paper presents a Petri
   net approach to mediation-aided composition of Web services. First,
   services are modeled as open WorkFlow Nets (oWFNs) and are composed
   using mediation transitions (MTs). Second, the modular reachability
   graph (MRG) of composition is automatically constructed and the
   compatibility is analyzed, so that the problem of state space explosion
   is significantly alleviated. Furthermore, an Event-Condition-Action
   (ECA) rule-based technique is developed to automatically generate the
   BPEL code of the composition, which can significantly save the time and
   labor of designers. Finally, the prototype system has been developed.
   Note to Practitioners-Web services are an emerging area for business
   process automation. This work presents a novel Petri net approach to
   mediation-aided composition of Web services. The proposed approach can
   greatly alleviate state space explosion to automatically verify the
   composition of partially incompatible services, and significantly save
   the time and labor of designers to obtain BPEL code. It consists of
   three phases: modeling composition of Web services, automatic
   verification of composition, and automatic generation of BPEL code. The
   prototype system has been developed based on the open source software
   PIPE and validated in a real-life case study. It is ready to be applied
   in industrial Web service composition for business automation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the advantages of using range extension

   rely on harvested energy, and therefore, if a required service is
   energy-intensive, the network may not be able to support the service
   successfully. We show that CT networks that utilize both range extension
   CT and non-CT routing can successfully support services that cannot be
   supported by non-CT networks. For a two-hop toy network, we show that
   range extension CT can provide better services than non-CT. Then, we
   provide a method of determining the supportable services that can be
   achieved by using optimal non-CT and CT routing protocols for EH-WSNs.
   Using our method and network simulations, we justify our claim that CT
   networks can provide better services than non-CT networks in EH-WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{Pure torsion of shape memory alloy (SMA) bars with circular cross

   energy balance for SMAs by taking into account the heat flux effect is
   coupled to a closed-form solution of SMA bars subjected to pure torsion.
   The resulting coupled thermo-mechanical equations are solved for SMA
   bars with circular cross sections. Several numerical case studies are
   presented and the necessity of considering the coupled thermo-mechanical
   formulation is demonstrated by comparing the results of the proposed
   model with those obtained by assuming an isothermal process during
   loading-unloading. Pure torsion of SMA bars in various ambient
   conditions (free and forced convection of air, and forced convection of
   water flow) subjected to different loading-unloading rates are studied
   and it is shown that the isothermal solution is valid only for specific
   combinations of ambient conditions and loading rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The shock compression response of cold-rolled Ni and Al multilayered
   composites at various angles of inclination are investigated by
   employing meso-scale simulations. The orientation of the laminate layers
   in the multilayered composite is varied at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90
   degrees to the direction of shock front propagation to determine and
   understand the resulting changes in the shock compression response.
   Real, heterogeneous microstructures, obtained from optical micrographs
   of the multilayered composite cross-section, are incorporated into the
   Eulerian, finite volume code, CTH. The simulations are performed to
   establish the role that the orientation of material interfaces plays in
   the dispersion and dissipation of the shock wave as well as the US-UP
   relationship for each configuration. Noticeable differences are observed
   at the meso-scale in the pressure, temperature, and strain response, as
   a function of the underlying microstructure. Geometric dispersion is
   seen to alter the shape of the resulting pressure pulse and inhibit the
   development of a steady-state shock wave in the laminate geometry. This
   effect is heightened by the extensive non-uniformities of the layering
   caused by cold-rolling. Additionally, two-dimensional effects of strain
   are seen to increase the dissipation of the shock wave through
   interfacial heating and shearing, resulting in high levels of viscosity
   and attenuation. While the effects of dispersion are minimal on the bulk
   response of the multilayered composite, the high rate of dissipation is
   seen to change the dependence of the shock velocity on the particle
   velocity, making dissipation a major contributor to the bulk response of
   these composites under shock compression. (C) 2012 American Institute of

   of Nd2Fe14B-based melt-spun ribbons is investigated. The magnetic field
   was applied in perpendicular or parallel direction to the ribbon plane

   patterns and TEM graphs show a strong grain size reduction upon the
   magnetic field application. The magnetic field also enhances the (001)

   The refined microstructure with significantly reduced grain size leads
   to enhanced magnetic exchange interactions between the hard and soft

Abstract = {{Energy transfer between two optical centers has long been used to
   promote the down-and up-conversion of light. In conventional phosphors,
   the two centers are distributed uniformly in 3D space and the
   luminescence efficiency is generally limited by energy transfer to
   defect states, where the excitation is quenched through non-radiative
   processes. In this paper, we present a new concept of low-dimensional
   doping of pairs of optical centers and explore its effect on enhancing
   the efficiency of down-and up-converted luminescence. The concept takes
   advantage of the fact that the low-dimensional doping profile
   significantly reduces the energy transfer rate to unintentional defects,
   which are naturally distributed in 3D space. The resultant de-coupling
   between optical centers and defects can lead to a substantial increase
   in luminescence efficiency.
   We first present the theoretical framework and apply the theory to
   well-characterized down-and up-conversion phosphors. For
   BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+, Mn2+ down-conversion phosphor, a factor of two
   increase in efficiency is predicted. For Na2Y3F11:Yb3+, Er3+
   up-conversion phosphor, low-dimensional doping did not lead to increase
   in efficiency. This is because the major quenching mechanism is
   cross-relaxation between Er3+ ions, not energy transfer to defects. In
   an ideal up-conversion phosphor, where defect quenching is the dominant
   loss mechanism, similar increases (by a factor of 2-5) are predicted.
   This work presents a new pathway to engineer luminescent materials and
   achieve high luminescence efficiencies in up-and down-conversion
   phosphors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The computations of the high-order partial derivatives in a given
   problem are often cumbersome or not accurate. To combat such
   shortcomings, a new method for calculating exact high-order
   sensitivities using multicomplex numbers is presented. Inspired by the
   recent complex step method that is only valid for first-order
   sensitivities, the new multicomplex approach is valid to arbitrary
   order. The mathematical theory behind this approach is revealed, and an
   efficient procedure for the automatic implementation of the method is
   described. Several applications are presented to validate and
   demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results
   are compared to conventional approaches such as finite differencing, the
   complex step method, and two separate automatic differentiation tools.
   The multicomplex method performs favorably in the preliminary
   comparisons and is therefore expected to be useful for a variety of
   algorithms that exploit higher order derivatives.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to analytically
   model the tool flank wear rate in near dry turning under built-up edge
   (BUE) effect. It involves the analysis of cutting forces, cutting
   temperatures and tool wear modes of abrasion, adhesion, and diffusion.
   The BUE formation is also considered in the view of the dynamic strain
   aging in the modified Oxley's model. The important factors related to
   this model are contact stresses and temperatures that are obtained from
   the cutting force model and the cutting temperature model. To develop
   these models, a set of cutting experiments using carbide tools on AISI
   1045 steels are performed to calibrate the coefficients in the models
   and to verify the proposed flank wear mechanisms. The comparisons
   between the model-predicted flank wear and experimental results show
   that the flank wear in near dry machining can be estimated well by the
   proposed models.}},

Abstract = {{Intracellular pH (pHs) plays a critical role in the physiological and
   pathophysiological processes of cells, and fluorescence imaging using
   pH-sensitive indicators provides a powerful tool to assess the pH, of
   intact cells and subcellular compartments. Here we describe a
   nanoparticle-based ratiometric pH sensor, comprising a bright and
   photostable semiconductor quantum dot (QD) and pH-sensitive fluorescent
   proteins (FPs), exhibiting dramatically improved sensitivity and
   photostability compared to BCECF, the most widely used fluorescent dye
   for pH imaging. We found that Forster resonance energy transfer between
   the QD and multiple FPs modulates the FP/QD emission ratio, exhibiting a
   >12-fold change between pH 6 and 8. The modularity of the probe enables
   customization to specific biological applications through genetic
   engineering of the FPs, as illustrated by the altered pH range of the
   probe through mutagenesis of the fluorescent protein. The QD-FP probes
   facilitate visualization of the acidification of endosomes In living
   cells following polyarginine-mediated uptake. These probes have the
   potential to enjoy a wide range of intracellular pH imaging applications
   that may not be feasible with fluorescent proteins or organic

Abstract = {{Field-effect transistors fabricated on graphene grown by chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD) often exhibit large hysteresis accompanied by low
   mobility, high positive backgate voltage corresponding to the minimum
   conductivity point (V-min), and high intrinsic canter concentration
   (eta(0)). In this report, we show that the mobility reported to date for
   CVD graphene devices on SiO2 is limited by trapped water between the
   graphene and SiO2 substrate, impurities introduced during the transfer
   process and adsorbates acquired from the ambient. We systematically
   study the origin of the scattering impurities and report on a process
   which achieves the highest mobility (mu) reported to date on large-area
   devices for CVD graphene on SiO2: maximum mobility (mu(max)) of 7800
   cm(2)/(V center dot s) measured at room temperature and 12 700 cm(2)/(V
   center dot s) at 77 K. These mobility values are dose to those reported
   for exfoliated graphene on SiO2 and can be obtained through the careful
   control of device fabrication steps Including minimizing resist residue
   and non-aqueous transfer combined with annealing. it is also observed
   that CVD graphene is prone to adsorption of atmospheric species, and
   annealing at elevated temperature in vacuum helps remove these species.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling coalescence events in a heterogeneous ensemble of condensing
   droplets on a surface is an outstanding fundamental challenge in surface
   and interfacial sciences, with a broad practical Importance in
   applications ranging from thermal management of high-performance
   electronic devices to moisture management in high-humidity environments.
   Nature-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces have been actively explored to
   enhance heat and mass transfer rates by achieving favorable dynamics
   during dropwise condensation; however, the effectiveness of such
   chemically homogeneous surfaces has been limited because condensing
   droplets tend to form as pinned Wenzel drops rather than mobile Cassie
   ones. Here, we Introduce an amphiphilic nanostructured surface,
   consisting of a hydrophilic base with hydrophobic tips, which promotes
   the periodic regeneration of nucleation sites for small droplets, thus
   rendering the surface self-rejuvenating. This unique amphiphilic
   nanointerface generates an arrangement of condensed Wenzel droplets that
   are fluidically linked by a wetted sublayer, promoting previously
   unobserved coalescence events where numerous droplets simultaneously
   merge, without direct contact. Such ensemble coalestences rapidly create
   fresh nucleation sites, thereby shifting the overall population toward
   smaller droplets and enhancing the rates of mass and heat transfer
   during condensation.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-based polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) matrix nanocomposites were
   fabricated by in situ polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) using
   (natural or organomodified) montmorillonite nanoclays (MMT) or cellulose
   whiskers (CW) as catalysts and as matrix modifiers, providing enhanced
   thermal performance. FUR analysis shows the catalyst-dependent formation
   of gamma-diketones that are generated from hydrolytic ring cleavage of
   the furan rings along the PFA chain. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
   shows that the PFA-based nanocomposites exhibit a notable increase in
   the onset of degradation temperature compared to pure PFA. The oxidative
   degradation behavior, including degradation onset temperature and
   residual weight, was analyzed and compared for the various
   nanocomposites. The higher thermal stability of 30BMMT-PFA as compared
   with NaMMT-PFA is tentatively attributed to blocking of Bronstedt acidic
   sites on the clay surface by residues of the organic modifier. However,
   the highest thermal stability among the various PFA-based nanocomposites
   that were studied in this work was observed in those containing
   nanocellulose whiskers (ON), even at much lower volume loadings.
   Finally, in addition to their surprisingly remarkable thermal stability,
   CW-PFA nanocomposites also exhibited improved mechanical toughness over
   previously reported PFA systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Conservation Issues for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes-Based Rotor
   Aeroelastic Simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{217-227}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aeroelastic simulations that are computed by coupling separate
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural dynamics
   (CSD) codes will include not only numerical errors in both the CFD and
   CSD methods, but also errors associated with the data exchange among the
   codes of the aerodynamic loads and moments and structural deflections.
   Whereas the numerical errors associated with the data interface have
   been investigated and quantified for fixed-wing applications, their
   effect has not been quantified for rotational applications, such as
   rotors and wind turbines, in which rigid body degrees of freedom cannot
   be separated from flexible motion of the blades. This paper provides a
   systematic analysis of the numerical errors introduced by the data
   interface for high-aspect ratio blades undergoing multibody dynamic
   motion including rotation. It is demonstrated that the failure to
   consider conservation of work or energy during the CFD-CSD data exchange
   can lead to a shift in the mean loading as observed for fixed-wing
   applications and an alteration of the controls necessary to achieve
   rotor trim affecting the rotor performance prediction. Various
   techniques to obtain minimal data transfer errors on a given grid are
   examined. Data transfer on unstructured CFD meshes appear to be more
   sensitive than the process on structured CFD meshes. DOI:

Abstract = {{In spite of the success of the stream of variation (SoV) approach to
   modeling variation propagation in multistation machining processes
   (MMPs), the absence of machining-induced variations could be an
   important factor that limits its application in accurate variation
   prediction. Such machining-induced variations are caused by
   geometric-thermal effects, cutting-tool wear, etc. In this paper, a
   generic framework for machining-induced variation representation based
   on differential motion vectors is presented. Based on this
   representation framework, machining-induced variations can be explicitly
   incorporated in the SoV model. An experimentation is designed and
   implemented to estimate the model coefficients related to spindle
   thermal-induced variations and cutting-tool wear-induced variations. The
   proposed model is compared with the conventional SoV model resulting in
   an average improvement on quality prediction of 67\%. This result
   verifies the advantage of the proposed extended SoV model. The
   application of the new model can significantly extend the capability of
   SoV-model-based methodologies in solving more complex quality
   improvement problems for MMPs, such as process diagnosis and process
   tolerance allocation, etc. {[}DOI:10.1115/1.4005790]}},

   Changes in Limb Forces across Biomechanical Contexts}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Optimality principles have been proposed as a general framework for
   understanding motor control in animals and humans largely based on their
   ability to predict general features movement in idealized motor tasks.
   However, generalizing these concepts past proof-of-principle to
   understand the neuromechanical transformation from task-level control to
   detailed execution-level muscle activity and forces during
   behaviorally-relevant motor tasks has proved difficult. In an
   unrestrained balance task in cats, we demonstrate that achieving
   task-level constraints center of mass forces and moments while
   minimizing control effort predicts detailed patterns of muscle activity
   and ground reaction forces in an anatomically-realistic musculoskeletal
   model. Whereas optimization is typically used to resolve redundancy at a
   single level of the motor hierarchy, we simultaneously resolved
   redundancy across both muscles and limbs and directly compared
   predictions to experimental measures across multiple perturbation
   directions that elicit different intra-and interlimb coordination
   patterns. Further, although some candidate task-level variables and cost
   functions generated indistinguishable predictions in a single
   biomechanical context, we identified a common optimization framework
   that could predict up to 48 experimental conditions per animal (n = 3)
   across both perturbation directions and different biomechanical contexts
   created by altering animals' postural configuration. Predictions were
   further improved by imposing experimentally-derived muscle synergy
   constraints, suggesting additional task variables or costs that may be
   relevant to the neural control of balance. These results suggested that
   reduced-dimension neural control mechanisms such as muscle synergies can
   achieve similar kinetics to the optimal solution, but with increased
   control effort (approximate to 2x) compared to individual muscle
   control. Our results are consistent with the idea that hierarchical,
   task-level neural control mechanisms previously associated with
   voluntary tasks may also be used in automatic brainstem-mediated
   pathways for balance.}},

Abstract = {{We have used full-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both
   random and blocky sequence hydrogel networks of
   poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-co-2hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
   (P(VP-co-HEMA)) with a composition of VP/ HEMA = 37: 13 to investigate
   the effect of the monomeric sequence and the water content on the
   transport properties of ascorbic acid and D-glucose at 310.15 K. The
   degrees of randomness of the monomer sequence for the random and the
   blocky copolymers were 1.170 and 0.104, respectively, and the degree of
   polymerization was fixed at 50. By analyzing the pair correlation
   functions, it was found that for both monomeric sequences, the guest
   molecules (i. e., ascorbic acid and D-glucose) have greater
   accessibility to the VP units than to the HEMA units due to the higher
   hydrophilicity of VP compared to HEMA units. While the monomeric
   sequence effect on the P(VPco- HEMA) hydrogel is clearly observed with
   20 wt. \% water content, the effect is significantly reduced with 40
   wt.\% water content and disappears completely with 80 wt. \% water
   content. This is because the hydrophilic guest molecules are more likely
   to be associated with water molecules than with the polymer network at
   the high water content. By analyzing the diffusion of the guest
   molecules and the inner-surface area, it is also found that the guest
   molecules are confined in the system at 20 wt. \% water content,
   resulting in highly anomalous sub-diffusion. Therefore, at low water
   content, the diffusion of the guest molecules in the hydrogel is
   directly affected by the monomeric sequence through the interaction of
   guest molecules with the monomeric units, whereas such monomeric
   sequence effects are significantly reduced with increasing water
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency (LF) seabed scattering at low grazing angles (LGA) is
   almost impossible to directly measure in shallow water (SW), except
   through inversion from reverberation. The energy flux method for SW
   reverberation is briefly introduced in this paper. The closed-form
   expressions of reverberation in an isovelocity waveguide, derived from
   this method, indicate that in the three-halves law range interval
   multimode/ray sea bottom scattering with different incident and
   scattering angles in forming the reverberation may equivalently be
   represented by the bottom backscattering at a single range-dependent
   angle. This equivalent relationship is used to derive the bottom
   backscattering strength (BBS) as a function of angle and frequency. The
   LF\&LGA BBS is derived in a frequency band of 200-2500 Hz and in a
   grazing angle range of 1.1 degrees-14.0 degrees from reverberation
   measurements at three sites with sandy bottoms. This is based on three
   previous works: (1) The closed-form expressions of SW reverberation
   {[}Zhou, (Chinese) Acta Acustica 5, 86-99 (1980)]; (2) the effective

Abstract = {{The surrogate-based recurrence framework (SBRF) approach to

   addition to accounting for realistic helicopter rotor blade dynamics, it
   is shown that the SBRF can model advancing rotor shock induced
   separation as well as retreating blade stall associated with excessive
   angles of attack. Therefore, the SBRF is ideally suited for a variety of

Abstract = {{The recent move toward physics-based elastohydrodynamics promises to
   yield advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of friction and
   film generation that were not possible a few years ago. However, the
   accurate correlation of the low-shear viscosity with temperature and
   pressure is an essential requirement. The Ashurst-Hoover thermodynamic
   scaling, which has been useful for thermal elastohydrodynamic
   simulation, is normalized here in a manner that maps the viscosity of
   three widely different liquids onto a master Stickel curve. The master
   curve can be represented by a combination of two exponential power law
   terms. These may be seen as expressions of different molecular
   interaction mechanisms similar to the two free-volume models of
   Batschinski-Hildebrand and Doolittle, respectively. The new correlation
   promises to yield more reasonable extrapolations to extreme conditions
   of temperature and pressure than free-volume models, and it removes the
   singularity that has prevented wide acceptance of free-volume models in
   numerical simulations. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005374]}},

Title = {{Quantitative cone-beam CT imaging in radiation therapy using planning CT
   as a prior: First patient studies}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1991-2000}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Quantitative cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging is on increasing
   demand for high-performance image guided radiation therapy (IGRT).
   However, the current CBCT has poor image qualities mainly due to scatter
   contamination. Its current clinical application is therefore limited to
   patient setup based on only bony structures. To improve CBCT imaging for
   quantitative use, we recently proposed a correction method using
   planning CT (pCT) as the prior knowledge. Promising phantom results have
   been obtained on a tabletop CBCT system, using a correction scheme with
   rigid registration and without iterations. More challenges arise in
   clinical implementations of our method, especially because patients have
   large organ deformation in different scans. In this paper, we propose an
   improved framework to extend our method from bench to bedside by
   including several new components.
   Methods: The basic principle of our correction algorithm is to estimate
   the primary signals of CBCT projections via forward projection on the
   pCT image, and then to obtain the low-frequency errors in CBCT raw
   projections by subtracting the estimated primary signals and low-pass
   filtering. We improve the algorithm by using deformable registration to
   minimize the geometry difference between the pCT and the CBCT images.
   Since the registration performance relies on the accuracy of the CBCT
   image, we design an optional iterative scheme to update the CBCT image
   used in the registration. Large correction errors result from the
   mismatched objects in the pCT and the CBCT scans. Another optional step
   of gas pocket and couch matching is added into the framework to reduce
   these effects.
   Results: The proposed method is evaluated on four prostate patients, of
   which two cases are presented in detail to investigate the method
   performance for a large variety of patient geometry in clinical
   practice. The first patient has small anatomical changes from the
   planning to the treatment room. Our algorithm works well even without
   the optional iterations and the gas pocket and couch matching. The image
   correction on the second patient is more challenging due to the effects
   of gas pockets and attenuating couch. The improved framework with all
   new components is used to fully evaluate the correction performance. The
   enhanced image quality has been evaluated using mean CT number and
   spatial nonuniformity (SNU) error as well as contrast improvement
   factor. If the pCT image is considered as the ground truth, on the four
   patients, the overall mean CT number error is reduced from over 300 HU
   to below 16 HU in the selected regions of interest (ROIs), and the SNU
   error is suppressed from over 18\% to below 2\%. The average soft-tissue
   contrast is improved by an average factor of 2.6.
   Conclusions: We further improve our pCT-based CBCT correction algorithm
   for clinical use. Superior correction performance has been demonstrated
   on four patient studies. By providing quantitative CBCT images, our
   approach significantly increases the accuracy of advanced CBCT-based
   clinical applications for IGRT. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{In a previous paper, conversion coefficients for the personal dose
   equivalent, H-p(d), for photons were reported. This note reports values
   for electrons calculated using similar techniques. The personal dose
   equivalent is the quantity used to approximate the protection quantity
   effective dose when performing personal dosemeter calibrations and in
   practice the personal dose equivalent is determined using a 303015 cm
   slab-type phantom. Conversion coefficients to 1 GeV have been calculated
   for H-p(10), H-p(3) and H-p(0.07) in the recommended slab phantom.
   Although the conversion coefficients were determined for discrete
   incident energies, analytical fits of the conversion coefficients over
   the energy range are provided using a similar formulation as in the
   photon results previously reported. The conversion coefficients for the
   personal dose equivalent are compared with the appropriate protection
   quantity, calculated according to the recommendations of the latest
   International Commission on Radiological Protection guidance. Effects of
   eyewear on H-p(3) are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This research explores the usage of classification approaches in order
   to facilitate the accurate estimation of probabilistic constraints in
   optimization problems under uncertainty. The efficiency of the proposed
   framework is achieved with the combination of a conventional topology
   optimization method and a classification approach-namely, probabilistic
   neural networks (PNN). Specifically, the implemented framework using PNN
   is useful in the case of highly nonlinear or disjoint failure domain
   problems. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated
   with three examples. The first example deals with the estimation of the
   limit state function in the case of disjoint failure domains. The second
   example shows the efficacy of the proposed method in the design of
   stiffest structure through the topology optimization process with the
   consideration of random field inputs and disjoint failure phenomenon,
   such as buckling. The third example demonstrates the applicability of
   the proposed method in a practical engineering problem.}},

Abstract = {{Arrays of silver nanorods (AgNRs) formed by oblique-angle deposition
   (OAD) are strongly anisotropic, with either metallic or dielectric
   characteristics depending on the polarization of incident light, and may

   work investigates the polarization-dependent reflectance of inclined
   AgNR arrays at the wavelengths of 635 and 977 nm. The specular
   reflectance at various incidence angles and the bidirectional
   reflectance distribution function were measured with a laser
   scatterometer, while the directional-hemispherical reflectance was
   measured with an integrating sphere. The AgNR layer is modeled as an
   effectively homogenous, optically uniaxial material using the effective
   medium theory to elucidate the dielectric or metallic response for
   differently polarized incidence. The thin-film optics formulation is
   modified considering optical anisotropy and surface scattering. This
   study helps gain a better understanding of optical properties of

Abstract = {{The existence of methane in Titan's atmosphere (similar to 6\% level at
   the surface) presents a unique enigma, as photochemical models predict
   that the current inventory will be entirely depleted by photochemistry
   in a timescale of similar to 20 Myr. In this paper, we examine the clues
   available from isotopic ratios (C-12/C-13 and D/H) in Titan's methane as
   to the past atmosphere history of this species. We first analyze recent
   infrared spectra of CH4 collected by the Cassini Composite Infrared
   Spectrometer, measuring simultaneously for the first time the abundances
   of all three detected minor isotopologues: (CH4)-C-13, (CH3D)-C-12, and
   (CH3D)-C-13. From these we compute estimates of C-12/C-13 = 86.5 +/- 8.2
   and D/H = (1.59 +/- 0.33) x 10(-4), in agreement with recent results
   from the Huygens GCMS and Cassini INMS instruments. We also use the
   transition state theory to estimate the fractionation that occurs in
   carbon and hydrogen during a critical reaction that plays a key role in
   the chemical depletion of Titan's methane: CH4 + C2H -> CH3 + C2H2.
   Using these new measurements and predictions we proceed to model the
   time evolution of C-12/C-13 and D/H in Titan's methane under several
   prototypical replenishment scenarios. In our Model 1 (no resupply of
   CH4), we find that the present-day C-12/C-13 implies that the CH4
   entered the atmosphere 60-1600 Myr ago if methane is depleted by
   chemistry and photolysis alone, but much more recently-most likely less
   than 10 Myr ago-if hydrodynamic escape is also occurring. On the other
   hand, if methane has been continuously supplied at the replenishment
   rate then the isotopic ratios provide no constraints, and likewise for
   the case where atmospheric methane is increasing. We conclude by
   discussing how these findings may be combined with other evidence to
   constrain the overall history of the atmospheric methane.}},

   six inflow hydrographs with a joint return period of 100 years.
   Afterward, the overtopping risk of the Doroudzan Dam was evaluated for
   all six inflow hydrographs by considering quantile of flood peak
   discharge, initial depth of water in the reservoir, and discharge
   coefficient of spillway as uncertain variables and using two uncertainty

Abstract = {{Humans are difficult targets to detect because they have small radar
   cross sections (RCS) and move at low velocities. Consequently, they are
   masked by Doppler spread ground clutter generated by the radar bearing
   platform motion. Furthermore, conventional radar-based human detection
   systems employ some type of linear-phase matched filtering, whereas most
   human targets generate a highly nonlinear phase history. This work
   proposes an enhanced, optimized, nonlinear phase (EnONLP) matched filter
   that exploits knowledge of human gait to improve the radar detection
   performance of human targets. A parametric model of the expected human
   response is derived for multi-channel radar systems and used to generate
   a dictionary of human returns for a range of possible parameter
   variations. The best linear combination of projections in this
   dictionary is computed via orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) to detect
   and extract features for multiple targets. Performance of the proposed
   EnONLP method is compared with that of traditional space-time adaptive
   processing (STAP) and a previously derived parameter estimation-based
   ONLP detector. Results show that EnONLP exhibits a detection probability
   of about 0.8 for a clutter-to-noise (CNR) ratio of 20 dB and input
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB, while ONLP yields a 0.3 and STAP
   yields a 0.18 probability of detection for the same false alarm rate.}},

Abstract = {{Bearing estimation algorithms obtain only a small number of direction of
   arrivals (DOAs) within the entire angle domain, when the sources are
   spatially sparse. Hence, we propose a method to specifically exploit
   this spatial sparsity property. The method uses a very small number of
   measurements in the form of random projections of the sensor data along
   with one full waveform recording at one of the sensors. A basis pursuit
   strategy is used to formulate the problem by representing the
   measurements in an overcomplete dictionary. Sparsity is enforced by
   l(1)-norm minimization which leads to a convex optimization problem that
   can be efficiently solved with a linear program. This formulation is
   very effective for decreasing communication loads in multi sensor
   systems. The algorithm provides increased bearing resolution and is
   applicable for both narrowband and wideband signals. Sensors positions
   must be known, but the array shape can be arbitrary. Simulations and
   field data results are provided to demonstrate the performance and
   advantages of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Anew design technique and analysis for an embedded electromagnetic band
   gap (EBG) structure is presented. In modern multifunction designs, it
   may be required to integrate noise-sensitive analog circuits next to
   digital circuits. Here, digital switching noise can propagate through
   power/ground planes and affect analog circuit performance. It is
   important to block this effect. To prevent the noise propagation, an
   EBG-patterned power/ground plane can be an acceptable solution. However,
   difficulties arise when the EBG structure is put in a stripline-like
   environment; the embedded EBG structure loses the noise filtering
   function. The reason for the functional failure is analyzed, followed by
   a solution. The proposed solution has been demonstrated by both
   simulation and measurement. Simulation and measurement results
   demonstrate that the proposed embedded EBG structure can be effective
   for the desired noise isolation. The design technique is tested on a
   prototype load board for a 10-bit 3-GHz analog-to-digital converter from
   National Semiconductor. The suggested design technique for the embedded
   EBG structure includes three design parameters: 1) the potentials of the
   planes above and below the EBG layer; 2) the thicknesses of the
   dielectric layers above and below the EBG layer; and 3) the number and
   position of vias interconnecting the top and bottom planes.}},

Abstract = {{On a 1.27-nm gate-oxide nMOSFET, we make a comprehensive study of
   SiO2/Si interface roughness by combining temperature-dependent electron
   mobility measurement, sophisticated mobility simulation, and
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement.
   Mobility measurement and simulation adequately extract the correlation
   length lambda and roughness rms height Delta of the sample, taking into
   account the Coulomb-drag-limited mobilities in the literature. The TEM
   measurement yields the apparent correlation length lambda(m) and
   roughness rms height Delta(m). It is found that the following hold: 1)
   lambda approximate to lambda(m) for both the Gaussian and exponential
   models, validating the temperature-oriented extraction process; 2) the
   extracted Delta (similar to 1.3 angstrom for the Gaussian model and 1.0
   angstrom for the exponential one) is close to that (similar to 1.2
   angstrom) of Delta(m), all far less than the conventional values
   (similar to 3 angstrom) in thick-gate-oxide case; and 3) the TEM 2-D
   projection correction coefficient Delta(m)/Delta is approximately 1.0,
   which cannot be elucidated with the current thick-gate-oxide-based
   knowledge.}},

Title = {{Quadrature Amplitude Modulated Backscatter in Passive and Semipassive
   UHF RFID Systems}},

Abstract = {{Passive and semipassive UHF RF identification (RFID) systems have
   traditionally been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross
   section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag.
   This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily
   limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and
   the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from
   an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of
   complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature
   modulation of the backscatter channel.
   When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift
   keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol
   period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags
   employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per
   symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol
   clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended
   read range. Alternatively, tags employing an M-ary modulator can achieve
   log(2) M higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power
   consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK.
   In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by
   passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the
   widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel
   CMOS-compatible method for generating M-ary quadrature amplitude
   modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for
   designing an inductorless M-ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an
   array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation
   and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state
   quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a
   semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band.
   This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of
   200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only
   115 nW.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of neural circuits are demonstrated via SPICE simulations and
   their applications are discussed. The neuron and synapse subcircuits
   include ambipolar nano-crystalline silicon transistor and memristor
   device models based on measured data. Neuron circuit characteristics and
   the Hebbian synaptic learning rule are shown to be similar to biology.
   Changes in the average firing rate learning rule depending on various
   circuit parameters are also presented. The subcircuits are then
   connected into larger neural networks that demonstrate fundamental
   properties including associative learning and pulse coincidence
   detection. Learned extraction of a fundamental frequency component from
   noisy inputs is demonstrated. It is then shown that if the fundamental
   sinusoid of one neuron input is out of phase with the rest, its synaptic
   connection changes differently than the others. Such behavior indicates
   that the system can learn to detect which signals are important in the
   general population, and that there is a spike-timing-dependent component
   of the learning mechanism. Finally, future circuit design and
   considerations are discussed, including requirements for the memristive
   device.}},

Abstract = {{Processing of high-permittivity ceramic films on free-standing bare
   copper foil for subsequent organic package integration requires
   high-temperature crystallization at low oxygen pressures. This
   frequently can result in incorporation of oxygen vacancies and copper

   reliability characteristics. Leakage current, breakdown voltage and
   electrical reliability of the devices were improved by incorporating 1\%
   excess barium and manganese dopant. Incorporation of dopants also
   resulted in enhanced densification and grain refinement. Leakage current
   analysis indicated Space-Charge-Limited Conduction as the dominant
   conduction mechanism in both undoped and doped films. The mechanisms by
   which acceptor dopants suppress oxygen vacancy creation and migration
   are discussed. Capacitance densities of 1.5-3 mu F/cm(2), with breakdown

Abstract = {{Our two closest living primate relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
   and bonobos (Pan paniscus), exhibit significant behavioral differences
   despite belonging to the same genus and sharing a very recent common
   ancestor. Differences have been reported in multiple aspects of social
   behavior, including aggression, sex, play and cooperation. However, the
   neurobiological basis of these differences has only been minimally
   investigated and remains uncertain. Here, we present the first ever
   comparison of chimpanzee and bonobo brains using diffusion tensor
   imaging, supplemented with a voxel-wise analysis of T1-weighted images
   to specifically compare neural circuitry implicated in social cognition.
   We find that bonobos have more gray matter in brain regions involved in
   perceiving distress in both oneself and others, including the right
   dorsal amygdala and right anterior insula. Bonobos also have a larger
   pathway linking the amygdala with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex,
   a pathway implicated in both top-down control of aggressive impulses as
   well as bottom-up biases against harming others. We suggest that this
   neural system not only supports increased empathic sensitivity in
   bonobos, but also behaviors like sex and play that serve to dissipate
   tension, thereby limiting distress and anxiety to levels conducive with
   prosocial behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic steering forces and moments on an axisymmetric bluff
   body are controlled by exploiting an induced, asymmetric, segmented
   attachment of the base flow to a Coanda surface at the body tail end.
   Control is effected by four individually addressable, aft-facing,
   synthetic jet actuators. The jets emanate from azimuthally segmented
   slots, equally distributed around the perimeter of the tail. The model
   is suspended in the wind tunnel by eight thin wires for minimal support
   interference with the wake. Each wire is instrumented with a miniature
   strain-gage transducer for direct dynamic force measurements. The
   aerodynamic effects associated with continuous and transitory asymmetric
   activation of the Coanda effect are characterized using force and
   hot-wire measurements. Transitory modulation of the actuation waveform
   of multiple actuators leads to the generation of significant dynamic
   radial forces of controlled magnitude and direction with potential
   utility for flight stabilization and fast maneuvering.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a whole-core stochastic-deterministic hybrid coarse mesh
   transport method is extended to 2-D hexagonal geometry. This method may
   be used to calculate the eigenvalue and explicit pin fission density
   profile of hexagonal reactor cores. It models the exact detail within
   complex heterogeneous cores without homogenizing regions or materials,
   and neither block-level nor core-level asymmetry poses any limitations
   to the method. It solves eigenvalue problems by first splitting the core
   into a set of coarse meshes, and then using Monte Carlo methods to
   create a library of response expansion coefficients, found by expanding
   the angular current in phase-space distribution using a set of
   polynomials orthogonal on the angular half-space defined by mesh
   boundaries. The coarse meshes are coupled by the angular current at
   their interfaces. A deterministic sweeping procedure is then used to
   iteratively construct the solution.
   The method is evaluated using benchmark problems based on a gas-cooled,
   graphite-moderated high temperature reactor. The method quickly solves
   problems to any level of detail desired by the user. In this paper, it
   is used to explicitly calculate the fission density of individual fuel
   pins and determine the reactivity worth of individual control rods. In
   every case, results for the core multiplication factor and pin fission
   density distribution are found within several minutes. Results are
   highly accurate when compared to direct Monte Carlo reference solutions:
   errors in the eigenvalue calculations are on the order of 0.02\%, and
   errors in the pin fission density average less than 0.1\%. Published by

Abstract = {{Motion planning for mobile vehicles involves the solution of two
   disparate subproblems: the satisfaction of high-level logical task
   specifications and the design of low-level vehicle control laws. A
   hierarchical solution of these two subproblems is efficient, but it may
   not ensure compatibility between the high-level planner and the
   constraints that are imposed by the vehicle dynamics. To guarantee such
   compatibility, we propose a motion-planning framework that is based on a
   special interaction between these two levels of planning. In particular,
   we solve a special shortest path problem on a graph at a higher level of
   planning, and we use a lower level planner to determine the costs of the
   paths in that graph. The overall approach hinges on two novel
   ingredients: a graph-search algorithm that operates on sequences of
   vertices and a lower level planner that ensures consistency between the
   two levels of hierarchy by providing meaningful costs for the edge
   transitions of a higher level planner using dynamically feasible,
   collision-free trajectories.}},

   these measurement systems, the prototype per each measurement has been
   constructed. The laser-based measurement system had a positioning error
   of +/- 4.5 mu m and the halogen lamp-based measurement system had a
   positioning error of +/- 2 mu m. Several experiments and simulations

   resonator. This architecture highly suppresses the support loss of the
   resonator to the surroundings while providing mechanical support and
   electrical signal delivery to the resonator. Qs as high as 13 500 in air
   at a frequency of similar to 134 MHz with a motional resistance of
   similar to 600 Omega and 35-dB spurious-free range of similar to 20 MHz

Abstract = {{The role of temperature gradient induced nanoparticle motion on
   conduction and convection was investigated. Possible mechanisms for
   variations resulting from variations in the thermophysical properties
   are theoretically and experimentally discussed. The effect of the
   nanoparticle motion on conduction is demonstrated through thermal
   conductivity measurement of deionized water with suspended CuO
   nanoparticles (50 nm in diameter) and correlated with the contributions
   of Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, etc. The tendencies observed is
   that the magnitude of and the variation in the thermal conductivity
   increases with increasing volume fraction for a given temperature, which
   is due primarily to the Brownian diffusion of the nanoparticles. Using
   dimensional analysis, the thermal conductivity is correlated and both
   the interfacial thermal resistance and near-field radiation are found to
   be essentially negligible. A modification term that incorporates the
   contributions of Brownian motion and thermophoresis is proposed. The
   effect of nanoscale convection is illustrated through an experimental
   investigation that utilized fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticle tracers
   (200 nm in diameter) and multilayer nanoparticle image velocimetry. The
   results indicate that both the magnitude and the deviation of the fluid
   motion increased with increasing heat flux in the near-wall region.
   Meanwhile, the fluid motion tended to decrease with the off-wall
   distance for a given heating power. A corresponding numerical study of
   convection of pure deionized water shows that the velocity along the
   off-wall direction is several orders of magnitude lower than that of
   deionized water, which indicates that Brownian motion in the near-wall
   region is crucial for fluid with suspended nanoparticles in convection.}},

Abstract = {{Multipollutant indicators of mobile source impacts are developed from
   readily available CO, NOx, and elemental carbon (EC) data for use in air
   quality and epidemiologic analysis. Two types of outcome-based
   Integrated Mobile Source Indicators (IMSI) are assessed. The first is
   derived from analysis of emissions of EC, CO, and NO, such that
   pollutant concentrations are mixed and weighted based on emission ratios
   for both gasoline and diesel vehicles. The emission-based indicators
   (IMSIEB) capture the impact of mobile sources on air quality estimated
   from receptor models and their uncertainty is comparable to measurement
   and source apportionment uncertainties. The IMSIEB have larger
   correlation between two different receptor sites impacted by traffic
   than single pollutants, suggesting they are better indicators of the
   local impact of mobile sources. A sensitivity analysis of fractions of
   pollutants in a two-pollutant mixture and the inclusion in an
   epidemiologic model is conducted to develop a second set of indicators
   based on health outcomes. The health-based indicators (IMSIHB) are
   weighted combinations of CO, NO,, and EC pairs that have the lowest P
   value in their association with cardiovascular disease emergency
   department visits, possibly due to their better spatial
   representativeness. These outcome-based, multipollutant indicators can
   provide support for the setting of multipollutant air quality standards
   and other air quality management activities.
   Implications: Integrated mobile source indicators HMSO were developed
   and assessed for use in air quality and epidemiologic analysis. IMSI
   contribute to fill the gap in the path towards a multipollutant air
   quality approach in two aspects: IMSI represent an innovative way to
   identify mixtures of pollutants based on outcomes and constitutes an
   alternative approach to assess multipollutant health effects. IMSI
   developed for mobile sources can be easily applied to other sources.
   Results can support the setting of multipollutant air quality standards.

Abstract = {{Chitosan hydrogels (CHs) have been considered as a potential implant
   material for replacement and repair of the Nucleus Pulposus (NP) within
   the intervertebral disk. The nonlinear mechanical behavior of a CH
   material is investigated experimentally and computationally in this
   study. A series of confined and unconfined compression tests are
   designed and conducted for this hydrogel. Hyperelastic strain energy
   density functions (SEDFs) are calibrated using the experimental data. A
   hyperelastic constitutive model is selected to best fit the multi-axial
   behavior of the hydrogel. Its general prediction ability is verified
   using finite element (FE) simulations of hydrogel indentation
   experiments conducted using a spherical tip indentor. In addition,
   digital image correlation (DIC) technique is also used in the
   indentation test in order to process the full-field surface strains
   where the indentor contacts the hydrogel. The DIC test results in the
   form of top-surface strains compared well with those predicted by the FE
   model. Results show repeatability for the examined specimens under the
   applied tests. Confined and unconfined test results are found to be
   sufficient to calibrate the SEDFs. The Ogden model was selected to
   represent the nonlinear behavior of the CH material which can be used in
   future biomechanical simulations of the spine. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles produce changes in the
   surrounding microscopic magnetic field. A method for generating contrast
   based on the application of an adiabatic preparation pulse and the
   failure of the adiabatic condition surrounding the nanoparticles is
   introduced in this article. Images were obtained in the presence and
   absence of an adiabatic preparation pulse and the difference was
   obtained. With the use of an adiabatic full passage pulse, the contrast
   in the difference image depends linearly on iron concentration up to 1
   mM. The use of an adiabatic zero passage pulse resulted in higher
   sensitivity to nanoparticles compared to the adiabatic full passage,
   while maintaining linear concentration dependence to 0.1 mM. This
   technique was shown to be insensitive to magnetization transfer and B0
   inhomogeneity. With its linearity with iron concentration and
   insensitivity to changes in the main magnetic field, the new method is
   well suited for quantitative iron oxide nanoparticle imaging. Magn Reson

Abstract = {{Recent independent experiments demonstrated that the lithiation-induced
   volume expansion in silicon nanowires, nanopillars, and microslabs is
   highly anisotropic, with predominant expansion along the < 110 >
   direction but negligibly small expansion along the < 111 > direction.
   The origin of such anisotropic behavior remains elusive. Here, we
   develop a chemomechanical model to study the phase evolution and
   morphological changes in lithiated silicon nanowires. The model couples
   the diffusive reaction of lithium with the lithiation-induced
   elasto-plastic deformation. We show that the apparent anisotropic
   swelling is critically controlled by the orientation-dependent mobility
   of the core-shell interface, i.e., the lithiation reaction rate at the
   atomically sharp phase boundary between the crystalline core and the
   amorphous shell. Our results also underscore the importance of
   structural relaxation by plastic flow behind the moving phase boundary,
   which is essential to quantitative prediction of the experimentally
   observed morphologies of lithiated silicon nanowires. The study sheds
   light on the lithiation-mediated failure in nanowire-based electrodes,
   and the modeling framework provides a basis for simulating the
   morphological evolution, stress generation, and fracture in
   high-capacity electrodes for the next-generation lithium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the output power of a nanogenerator is essential in
   applications as a sustainable power source for wireless sensors and
   microelectronics. We report here a novel approach that greatly enhances
   piezoelectric power generation by introducing a p-type polymer layer on
   a piezoelectric semiconducting thin film. Holes at the film surface
   greatly reduce the piezoelectric potential screening effect caused by
   free electrons in a piezoelectric semiconducting material. Furthermore,
   additional carriers from a conducting polymer and a shift in the Fermi
   level help in increasing the power output. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
   was used as a p-type polymer on piezoelectric semiconducting zinc oxide
   (ZnO) thin film, and phenyl-C-61-butyric add methyl ester (PCBM) was
   added to P3HT to improve carrier transport. The ZnO/P3HT:PCBM-assembled
   piezoelectric power generator demonstrated 18-fold enhancement in the
   output voltage and tripled the current, relative to a power generator
   with ZnO only at a strain of 0.068\%. The overall output power density
   exceeded 0.88 W/cm(3), and the average power conversion efficiency was
   up to 18\%. This high power generation enabled red, green, and blue
   light-emitting diodes to turn on after only tens of times bending the
   generator. This approach offers a breakthrough in realizing a
   high-performance flexible piezoelectric energy harvester for
   self-powered electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To comprehensively characterize the dosimetric properties of a
   clinical digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) system for the acquisition
   of mammographic and tomosynthesis images.
   Materials and Methods: Compressible water-oil mixture phantoms were
   created and imaged by using the automatic exposure control (AEC) of the
   Selenia Dimensions system (Hologic, Bedford, Mass) in both DBT and
   full-field digital mammography (FFDM) mode. Empirical measurements of
   the x-ray tube output were performed with a dosimeter to measure the air
   kerma for the range of tube current-exposure time product settings and
   to develop models of the automatically selected x-ray spectra. A Monte
   Carlo simulation of the system was developed and used in conjunction
   with the AEC-chosen settings and spectra models to compute and compare
   the mean glandular dose (MGD) resulting from both imaging modalities for
   breasts of varying sizes and glandular compositions.
   Results: Acquisition of a single craniocaudal view resulted in an MGD
   ranging from 0.309 to 5.26 mGy in FFDM mode and from 0.657 to 3.52 mGy
   in DBT mode. For a breast with a compressed thickness of 5.0 cm and a
   50\% glandular fraction, a DBT acquisition resulted in an only 8\%
   higher MGD than an FFDM acquisition (1.30 and 1.20 mGy, respectively).
   For a breast with a compressed thickness of 6.0 cm and a 14.3\%
   glandular fraction, a DBT acquisition resulted in an 83\% higher MGD
   than an FFDM acquisition (2.12 and 1.16 mGy, respectively).
   Conclusion: For two-dimensional-three-dimensional fusion imaging with
   the Selenia Dimensions system, the MGD for a 5-cm-thick 50\% glandular
   breast is 2.50 mGy, which is less than the Mammography Quality Standards
   Act limit for a two-view screening mammography study. (C) RSNA, 2012}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for analyzing some product properties of
   functionally graded magneto-electro-thermoelastic (METE) multilayer
   composites. The method is based on an exact matrix formulation for the
   effective properties of multilayer composites with various coupled
   physical effects including piezoelectricity, piezomagnetism, and
   thermoelasticity. Analytical expressions are derived for the effective
   properties of a functionally graded transversely isotropic METE
   multilayer composite. The effects of functional gradation on the
   pyroelectric and pyromagnetic coefficients are numerically evaluated. It
   is shown that both the pyroelectric and pyromagnetic coefficients can be
   significantly enhanced (more than two times) by functional gradation,
   and the relative volume fractions at which these coefficients are
   maximized tend to extreme values. It is thus demonstrated that the
   present method can be used in the design of multilayered METE composites
   for the purpose of achieving a maximum energy conversion or transduction

Abstract = {{Surface-wave methods are widely used in earth sciences and engineering
   for the geometric characterization of geological bodies and tectonic
   structures of the subsurface. These techniques exploit the dispersive
   nature of Rayleigh waves to indirectly estimate shear wave velocity
   profiles from surface-wave measurements; however, they are limited to
   parallel-layered geometries. To overcome such limitations, we present a
   new class of geometric inverse models for a full waveform inversion
   (FWI) based on the boundary element method (BEM). The proposed approach
   enables an effective identification of two dimensional (2D) subsurface
   geometries by directly estimating the shape of laterally varying
   interfaces from raw measurements. It thus aims at filling the gap
   between the standard simplistic parallel-layered-based inversion and
   that of more complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries based on finite
   element methods (FEMs). Numerical tests on synthetic data unveil the
   effectiveness of the inverse algorithm, and its applicability to field
   measurements is finally presented.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{550-560}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Retrofitting existing buildings is urgent given the increasing need to
   improve the energy efficiency of the existing building stock. This paper
   presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large
   scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for
   uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of
   normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy
   models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance
   equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of
   buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved
   representation of the actual buildings and quantification of
   uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the
   calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from
   retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit
   performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated
   to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit
   interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology
   with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit
   options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly
   inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Voltage-sensitive dye imaging reveals improved topographic activation of
   cortex in response to manipulation of thalamic microstimulation
   parameters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Voltage-sensitive dye imaging was used to quantify in vivo, network
   level spatiotemporal cortical activation in response to electrical
   microstimulation of the thalamus in the rat vibrissa pathway. Thalamic
   microstimulation evoked a distinctly different cortical response than
   natural sensory stimulation, with response to microstimulation spreading
   over a larger area of cortex and being topographically misaligned with
   the cortical column to which the stimulated thalamic region projects.
   Electrical stimulation with cathode-leading asymmetric waveforms reduced
   this topographic misalignment while simultaneously increasing the
   spatial specificity of the cortical activation. Systematically
   increasing the asymmetry of the microstimulation pulses revealed a
   continuum between symmetric and asymmetric stimulation that gradually
   reduced the topographic bias. These data strongly support the hypothesis
   that manipulation of the electrical stimulation waveform can be used to
   selectively activate specific neural elements. Specifically, our results
   are consistent with the prediction that cathode-leading asymmetric
   waveforms preferentially stimulate cell bodies over axons, while
   symmetric waveforms preferentially activate axons over cell bodies. The
   findings here provide some initial steps toward the design and
   optimization of microstimulation of neural circuitry, and open the door
   to more sophisticated engineering tools, such as nonlinear system
   identification techniques, to develop technologies for more effective
   control of activity in the nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors of various modalities and capabilities, especially cameras, have
   become ubiquitous in our environment. Their intended use is wide ranging
   and encompasses surveillance, transportation, entertainment, education,
   healthcare, emergency response, disaster recovery, and the like.
   Technological advances and the low cost of such sensors enable
   deployment of large-scale camera networks in large metropolises such as
   London and New York. Multimedia algorithms for analyzing and drawing
   inferences from video and audio have also matured tremendously in recent
   times. Despite all these advances, large-scale reliable systems for
   media-rich sensor-based applications, often classified as
   situation-awareness applications, are yet to become commonplace. Why is
   that? There are several forces at work here. First, the system
   abstractions are just not at the right level for quickly prototyping
   such applications on a large scale. Second, while Moore's law has held
   true for predicting the growth of processing power, the volume of data
   that applications are called upon to handle is growing similarly, if not
   faster. Enormous amount of sensing data is continually generated for
   real-time analysis in such applications. Further, due to the very nature
   of the application domain, there are dynamic and demanding resource
   requirements for such analyses. The lack of right set of abstractions
   for programing such applications coupled with their data-intensive
   nature have hitherto made realizing reliable large-scale
   situation-awareness applications difficult. Incidentally, situation
   awareness is a very popular but ill-defined research area that has
   attracted researchers from many different fields. In this paper, we
   adopt a strong systems perspective and consider the components that are
   essential in realizing a fully functional situation-awareness system.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Steel fiber-reinforced ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is of
   increasing interest for use in precast prestressed concrete highway
   bridge girders due to its superior durability and the potential for
   reducing or eliminating shear reinforcement, due to the presence of
   steel fibers. However, the contributions of creep, and especially
   tensile creep, to long-term performance must be better understood to
   develop appropriate design specifications. Due to practical
   considerations, it is also of interest to investigate the influence of
   varying thermal treatment, including temperatures lower than those
   recommended by the manufacturer (i.e. 90 degrees C), on the creep of
   UHPC. In this 1-year study, the effects of three different thermal
   treatment regimes on tensile and compressive creep performance of UHPC
   are examined, with complementary characterization by nanoindentation and
   scanning electron microscopy. Results show that UHPC creeps
   phenomenologically differently in tension and compression. Both thermal
   treatments examined resulted in similar tensile creep behavior,
   suggesting that a lower temperature applied over a longer period could
   effectively cure UHPC. For the non-thermally cured UHPC, a 10 mu m wide
   region observed at the fiber/matrix interface was characterized by
   reductions in elastic modulus as well as greater porosity and
   microcracking than the bulk paste. It is suggested that the quality of
   the fiber/matrix interface is a major contributor to the measured
   increased creep of non-thermally treated UHPC as compared to UHPC
   treated at 60 degrees C or 90 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Assembling individual genomes from complex community metagenomic data
   remains a challenging issue for environmental studies. We evaluated the
   quality of genome assemblies from community short read data (Illumina
   100 bp pair-ended sequences) using datasets recovered from freshwater
   and soil microbial communities as well as in silico simulations. Our
   analyses revealed that the genome of a single genotype (or species) can
   be accurately assembled from a complex metagenome when it shows at least
   about 20 x coverage. At lower coverage, however, the derived assemblies
   contained a substantial fraction of non-target sequences (chimeras),
   which explains, at least in part, the higher number of hypothetical
   genes recovered in metagenomic relative to genomic projects. We also
   provide examples of how to detect intrapopulation structure in
   metagenomic datasets and estimate the type and frequency of errors in
   assembled genes and contigs from datasets of varied species complexity.

Abstract = {{Machine prognosis can be considered as the generation of long-term

   the fault indicator and estimates the probability density function (pdf)
   of RUL. The ANFIS is trained and integrated in a high-order particle
   filter as a model describing the fault progression. The high-order
   particle filter is used to estimate the current state and carry out
   p-step-ahead predictions via a set of particles. These predictions are
   used to estimate the RUL pdf. The performance of the proposed method is
   evaluated via the real-world data from a seeded fault test for a UH-60
   helicopter planetary gear plate. The results demonstrate that it
   outperforms both the conventional ANFIS predictor and the
   particle-filter-based predictor where the fault growth model is a
   first-order model that is trained via the ANFIS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Microfluidic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems have set milestones
   for small volume (100 nL-5 mu L), amplification speed (100-400 s), and
   on-chip integration of upstream and downstream sample handling including
   purification and electrophoretic separation functionality. In practice,
   the microfluidic chips in these systems require either insertion of
   thermocouples or calibration prior to every amplification. These factors
   can offset the speed advantages of microfluidic PCR and have likely
   hindered commercialization. We present an infrared, laser-mediated, PCR
   system that features a single calibration, accurate and repeatable
   precision alignment, and systematic thermal modeling and management for
   reproducible, open-loop control of PCR in 1 mu L chambers of a polymer
   microfluidic chip. Total cycle time is less than 12 min: 1 min to fill
   and seal, 10 min to amplify, and 1 min to recover the sample. We
   describe the design, basis for its operation, and the precision
   engineering in the system and microfluidic chip. From a single
   calibration, we demonstrate PCR amplification of a 500 bp amplicon from
   lambda-phage DNA in multiple consecutive trials on the same instrument
   as well as multiple identical instruments. This simple, relatively
   low-cost plug-and-play design is thus accessible to persons who may not
   be skilled in assembly and engineering.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Satellite-based observations indicate that seasonal patterns in canopy
   greenness and productivity in the Amazon are negatively correlated with
   precipitation, with increased greenness occurring during the dry months.
   Flux tower measurements indicate that the canopy greening that occurs
   during the dry season is associated with increases in net ecosystem
   productivity (NEP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Land surface and
   terrestrial biosphere model simulations for the region have predicted
   the opposite of these observed patterns, with significant declines in
   greenness, NEP, and ET during the dry season. In this study, we address
   this issue mainly by developing an empirically constrained,
   light-controlled phenology submodel within the Ecosystem Demography
   model version 2 (ED2). The constrained ED2 model with a suite of field
   observations shows markedly improved predictions of seasonal ecosystem
   dynamics, more accurately capturing the observed patterns of seasonality
   in water, carbon, and litter fluxes seen at the Tapajos National Forest,
   Brazil (2.86 degrees S, 54.96 degrees W). Long-term simulations indicate
   that this light-controlled phenology increases the resilience of Amazon
   forest NEP to interannual variability in climate forcing.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to investigate the corrosion resistance and
   biocompatibility of three kinds of Fe based bulk metallic glasses
   (BMGs), Fe41Co7Cr15Mo14C15B6Y2 (BMG1), (Fe44Cr5Co5Mo13Mn11C16B6)(98)Y-2
   (BMG2), and Fe48Cr15Mo14C15B6Er2 (BMG3) by electrochemical measurements
   and indirect contact cytotoxicity assays, respectively. In comparison
   with 316 L SS biomedical steel, Fe based BMGs show better corrosion
   resistance in both simulated body fluids (Hank's solution and artificial
   saliva). The OCP curves show that the passive film on the Fe based BMG
   surfaces is quite stable, like 316 L SS. The corrosion current densities
   obtained from the anodic polarization curves from the lowest to highest
   are as follows: BMG3 < BMG1 < BMG2 < 316 L SS. The EIS analysis
   indicates that the Fe Based BMGs have larger polarization resistance
   value than that of 316 L SS except for BMG2 in artificial saliva. The
   pitting corrosion potentials of Fe based BMGs are much higher than that
   of the 316 L SS, resulting in very few ions releasing into the
   electrolytes while a significant amount of Ni and Fe ions release was
   found for 316 L SS under the same condition. The indirect cytotoxicity
   results suggest that all three Fe based BMG extracts have no
   cytotoxicity to L929 and NIH3T3 cells. All these results demonstrate
   that Fe based BMGs will open up a new path for the biomedical
   applications, especially in dental implantology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   layer of the DRNFS make the system cope with temporal problems, which
   allows the robot to memorize the previous environment information. The
   parameters and structure of the DRNFS can be automatically optimized
   through the learning process. The parameter optimization is realized by
   the ordered derivative algorithm, and the structure simplification is
   completed by the fuzzy rules similarity measure. Simulation results are
   presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the microscale mechanisms that govern dilatancy and
   critical state, the changes in topology of a granular assembly during
   numerical simulations of quasi-static deformation are analysed. In this
   article we show that explanations for these unique features of granular
   matter lie in the interplay of evolving frequency of microscopic
   topological events (flips) and elastic relaxation of particles, both of
   which are consequences of the history-dependent organisation of
   interparticle forces in force chains. Specifically, dilatancy has two
   components - one is the result of increasing frequency of flips and the
   other arises from the elementary volume increases that accompany the
   flips as elastic relaxation. The critical state arises as the balance
   between the dilation rate and the compaction rate under shear-induced
   disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{The Afyon-Bolkardag Zone (ABZ) is made up of two main metamorphic
   sequences - a Paleozoic sequence and a Mesozoic sequence, both
   containing metadetrital rocks and metacarbonates. Although the
   metasediments have similar tectonic settings and sedimentary
   provenances, the Mesozoic sequence has transgressive characteristics and
   includes dolomitic metacarbonates and metavolcanics. In the Ilgin
   (Konya) area, the low-grade metavolcanics were originally rhyolitic
   lavas and tuffs. Metarhyolites are extensively K-feldspathised.
   K-metasomatism has produced K-feldspar porphyroblasts, sericitization in
   the matrix and has modified the K/Na, K/Rb and Rb/Sr ratios. The
   metarhyolites are extremely K-rich (6-11 wt.\% K2O), with one exception
   that is marginally alkaline. They are subalkaline and calcalkaline in
   character. The REE data define two groups of metarhyolites having
   relatively high and low heavy REE abundances. The results indicate an
   origin of the high-K rhyolites in an extensional tectonic regime during
   the early-Alpine rifting stage, which could be related to the opening of
   the northern branch of the Neo-Tethys on the northern margin of Gondwana
   as a consequence of a southward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys.
   The mineral assemblage of the Paleozoic metasedimentary sequence is
   quartz, albite, chlorite, muscovite, biotite, calcite, stilpnomelane,
   and chloritoid, whilst the absence of stilpnomelane and chloritoid in
   the Mesozoic metasedimentary sequence demonstrates low-grade greenschist
   metamorphism and also decreasing metamorphic grade upwards. P-T
   conditions vary around 380-410 degrees C and >= 5 kbar for Paleozoic and
   Mesozoic mica schists and associated metarhyolite.
   One sample from the Paleozoic sequence yielded a phengite K-Ar age value
   of 96.9 +/- 1.4 Ma, whilst three samples from the Mesozoic sequence
   yielded phengite K-Ar age values of 70.2 +/- 1.0 Ma, 65.6 +/- 1.0 Ma and
   64.4 +/- 1.0 Ma. These age values are likely a consequence of incomplete
   resetting of the K-Ar system in the phyllosilicates during Alpine (Late
   Cretaceous-present) low-grade metamorphism in this region. Three
   metarhyolites from the Mesozoic sequence yielded whole-rock K-Ar age
   values of 60.4 +/- 0.9 Ma, 62.6 +/- 0.9 Ma and 64 +/- 2 Ma which also
   could reflect Alpine metamorphism and metasomatism.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal diffusivity of vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT,
   multi-walled) films synthesized by thermal chemical vapor deposition was
   measured by a laser flash technique, and shown to be similar to 30 mm(2)
   s(-1) the tube-alignment direction. The calculated thermal
   conductivities of the VACNT films and the individual CNTs were similar
   to 27 and similar to 540 W m(-1) K-1, respectively. The technique was
   verified to be reliable although a proper sampling procedure is
   critical. A systematic parametric study of the effects of defects,
   buckling, tip-to-tip contacts, packing density, and tube-tube
   interaction on the thermal diffusivity was carried out. Defects and
   buckling decreased the thermal diffusivity dramatically. An increased
   packing density was beneficial in increasing the collective thermal
   conductivity of the VACNT film; however, the increased tube-tube
   interaction in dense VACNT films decreased the effective thermal
   conductivity of the individual CNTs in the films. The tip-to-tip contact
   resistance was shown to be similar to 1 x 10(-7) m(2) K W-1. The study
   will shed light on the potential application of VACNTs as thermal
   interface materials in microelectronic packaging. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The adhesion of spores of Bacillus anthracis - the cause of anthrax and
   a likely biological threat - to solid surfaces is an important
   consideration in cleanup after an accidental or deliberate release.
   However, because of safety concerns, directly studying B. anthracis
   spores with advanced instrumentation is problematic. As a first step, we
   are examining the electrostatic potential of Bacillus thuringiensis
   (Bt), which is a closely related species that is often used as a
   simulant to study B. anthracis. Scanning surface potential microscopy
   (SSPM), also known as Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), was used to
   investigate the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the surface
   electrostatic potential of Bt that had adhered to silica, mica, or gold
   substrates. AFM/SSPM side-by-side images were obtained separately in
   air, at various values of RH, after an aqueous droplet with spores was
   applied on each surface and allowed to dry before measurements. In the
   SSPM images, a negative potential on the surface of the spores was
   observed compared with that of the substrates. The surface potential
   decreased as the humidity increased. Spores were unable to adhere to a
   surface with an extremely negative potential, such as mica. (C) 2011

Title = {{Total-Variation Regularization Based Inverse Planning for Intensity
   Modulated Arc Therapy}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH \& TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT) delivers conformal dose
   distributions through continuous gantry rotation with constant or
   variable speed while modulating the field aperture shape and weight. The
   enlarged angular space and machine delivery constraints make inverse
   planning of IMAT more intractable as compared to its counterpart of
   fixed gantry IMRT. Currently, IMAT inverse planning is being done using
   two extreme methods: the first one computes in beamlet domain with a
   subsequent arc leaf sequencing, and the second proceeds in machine
   parameter domain with entire emphasis placed on a pre-determined
   delivery method without exploring potentially better alternative
   delivery schemes. Towards truly optimizing the IMAT treatment on a
   patient specific basis, in this work we propose a total-variation based
   inverse planning framework for IMAT, which takes advantage of the useful
   features of the above two existing approaches while avoiding their
   shortcomings. A quadratic optimization algorithm has been implemented to
   demonstrate the performance and advantage of the proposed approach.
   Applications of the technique to a prostate case and a head and neck
   case indicate that the algorithm is capable of generating IMAT plans
   with patient specific numbers of arcs efficiently. Superior dose
   distributions and delivery time are achieved with a maximum number of
   apertures of three for each field. As compared to conventional
   beamlet-based algorithms, our method regularizes the field modulation
   complexity during optimization, and permits us to obtain the best
   possible plan with a pre-set modulation complexity of fluences. As
   illustrated in both prostate and head-and-neck case studies, the
   proposed method produces more favorable dose distributions than the
   segment-based algorithms, by optimally accommodating the clinical need
   of intensity modulation levels for each individual field. On a more
   fundamental level, our formulation preserves the convexity of
   optimization and makes the search of the global optimal solution
   possible with a deterministic method.}},

Abstract = {{A platform for manipulation and examination the acoustic guitar is
   presented, based on a novel guitar design - the Chameleon Guitar -
   featuring a replaceable acoustic resonator functioning as the soundboard
   of the instrument. The goal of the design process is to create a tone as
   sonically close to that of a traditional guitar as possible, while
   maintaining an easily replaceable soundboard. An iterative, data driven
   approach was used, each design step coming under examination from one or
   more measurement tools: finite-element method, acoustic impulse testing,
   and laser vibrometry. Ideal resonator geometry, bridge location, and
   piezoelectric sensor positions were determined. The finished instrument
   was then examined with laser vibrometry to confirm earlier results,
   evaluate the behavior and chosen sensor positions for various tonewoods,
   and examine the acoustic effects of adding sensors and wax finish. The
   conclusions drawn are diverse and point to the significance of attention
   to detail in each step of instrument construction. For example, when
   changing instrument material from one softwood to another, ideal
   locations for piezoelectric sensors are subject to change. We conclude
   that detailed acoustic analysis can significantly aid in the
   construction of new instruments by quantifying the impact of instrument
   geometry and material properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{One of the most promising cell-based therapies for combating
   insulin-dependent diabetes entails the use of genetically engineered
   non-beta cells that secrete insulin in response to physiologic stimuli.
   A normal pancreatic beta cell secretes insulin in a biphasic manner in
   response to glucose. The first phase is characterized by a transient
   stimulation of insulin to rapidly lower the blood glucose levels, which
   is followed by a second phase of insulin secretion to sustain the
   lowered blood glucose levels over a longer period of time. Previous
   studies have demonstrated hepatic and enteroendocrine cells to be
   appropriate hosts for recombinant insulin expression. Due to different
   insulin secretion kinetics from these cells, we hypothesized that a
   combination of the two cell types would mimic the biphasic insulin
   secretion of normal beta cells with higher fidelity than either cell
   type alone. In this study, insulin secretion experiments were conducted
   with two hepatic cell lines (HepG2 and H4IIE) transduced with 1 of 3
   adenoviruses expressing the insulin transgene and with a stably
   transfected recombinant intestinal cell line (GLUTag-INS). Insulin
   secretion was stimulated by exposing the cells to glucose only (hepatic
   cells), meat hydrolysate only (GLUTag-INS), or to a cocktail of the two
   secretagogues. It was found experimentally that the recombinant hepatic
   cells secreted insulin in a more sustained manner, whereas the
   recombinant intestinal cell line exhibited rapid insulin secretion
   kinetics upon stimulation. The insulin secretion profiles were
   computationally combined at different cell ratios to arrive at the
   combinatorial kinetics. Results indicate that combinations of these two
   cell types allow for tuning the first and second phase of insulin
   secretion better than either cell type alone. This work provides the
   basic framework in understanding the secretion kinetics of the combined
   system and advances it towards preclinical studies. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) networks have been proposed as a solution to both
   spectrum inefficiency and spectrum scarcity problems. However, they face
   several challenges based on the fluctuating nature of the available
   spectrum, making it more difficult to support seamless communications,
   especially in CR cellular networks. In this paper, a spectrum-aware
   mobility management scheme is proposed for CR cellular networks. First,
   a novel network architecture is introduced to mitigate heterogeneous
   spectrum availability. Based on this architecture, a unified mobility
   management framework is developed to support diverse mobility events in
   CR networks, which consists of spectrum mobility management, user
   mobility management, and intercell resource allocation. The spectrum
   mobility management scheme determines a target cell and spectrum band
   for CR users adaptively dependent on time-varying spectrum
   opportunities, leading to increase in cell capacity. In the user
   mobility management scheme, a mobile user selects a proper handoff
   mechanism so as to minimize a switching latency at the cell boundary by
   considering spatially heterogeneous spectrum availability. Intercell
   resource allocation helps to improve the performance of both mobility
   management schemes by efficiently sharing spectrum resources with
   multiple cells. Simulation results show that the proposed method can
   achieve better performance than conventional handoff schemes in terms of
   both cell capacity as well as mobility support in communications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an effective and computationally efficient proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced order modeling approach is
   presented, which utilizes selected sets of observed thermal sensor data
   inside the data centers to help predict the data center temperature
   field as a function of the air flow rates of computer room air
   conditioning (CRAC) units. The approach is demonstrated through
   application to an operational data center of 102.2 m(2) (1100 square
   feet) with a hot and cold aisle arrangement of racks cooled by one CRAC
   unit. While the thermal data throughout the facility can be collected in
   about 30 min using a 3D temperature mapping tool, the POD method is able
   to generate temperature field throughout the data center in less than 2
   s on a high end desktop personal computer (PC). Comparing the obtained
   POD temperature fields with the experimentally measured data for two
   different values of CRAC flow rates shows that the method can predict
   the temperature field with the average error of 0.68 degrees C or 3.2\%.
   The maximum local error is around 8 degrees C, but the total number of
   points where the local error is larger than 1 degrees C, is only similar
   to 6\% of the total domain points. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004011]}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of processing generalized
   k-nearest neighbor (GkNN) queries, which involve both spatial and
   non-spatial specifications for data objects, in a wireless broadcasting
   system. We present a method for processing GkNN queries on the broadcast
   stream. In particular, we propose a novel R-tree variant index
   structure, called the bit-vector R-tree (bR-tree), which stores
   additional bit-vector information to describe non-spatial attribute
   values of the data objects. In addition, each node in the bR-tree stores
   only one pointer to its children, which makes the bR-tree compact. We
   generate the broadcast stream by multiplexing the bR-tree and the data
   objects in the broadcasting channel. The corresponding search algorithm
   for the broadcast stream is also described. Through a series of
   comprehensive simulation experiments, we prove the efficiency of the
   proposed method with regard to energy consumption, latency, and memory
   requirement, which are the major performance concerns in a wireless
   broadcasting system. Furthermore, we test the practicality of the
   proposed method in a real prototype system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

   houses}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{90-103}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the challenges to net zero energy houses to the
   next level, which is to take them off the grid. This raises the stakes
   significantly as there is no reliance on the infinite storage that the
   grid provides, but only on the local energy storage.
   Overall reliability and resilience are the basic demands that need to be
   satisfied by the design and system sizing. We investigate a special
   aspect of power reliability, arguing that maintaining thermal comfort
   and guaranteeing power availability will be the two most important
   performance indicators in an off-grid house design. Due to the dynamic
   characteristic of a renewable energy generation system it is often
   difficult to maintain a stable thermal comfort level without investing
   in an oversized renewable power system. This paper presents a stochastic
   model based energy management system that distributes energy based on
   acceptable ranges of thermal comfort levels and manages electricity
   storage in batteries, driven by the projected energy demand and the
   projected energy generation. The objective of the stochastic model based
   control is to guide system operation and reach a balance between
   acceptable thermal comfort and general power reliability in an off-grid
   residence. Simulation results indicate that the proposed stochastic
   model based controller decreases the risk of power unavailability by up
   to 24\% without sacrificing indoor thermal comfort dramatically. A
   follow-up sensitivity analysis demonstrates versatilities of the
   controller in practical application. Certain limitations in its
   application are discussed at the end of this paper. Published by

Abstract = {{Control system design for flexible robotic systems requires special care
   with regard to the control system design to prevent oscillation in the
   system's resonant modes. If the resonant frequencies of such a system
   are known, it is possible to determine a switching command that delivers
   comparable actuation without exciting these natural modes of vibration.
   If there is redundancy in actuation, it can be exploited to suppress
   vibration with a reduced amount of actuator changes in state. Minimum
   switching discrete switching vibration suppression (MSDSVS) involves
   choosing a switching function with integer amplitudes and continuously
   variable switch timings to force the root of the residual oscillation
   function with respect to frequency to be at a resonance. By minimizing
   the one norm of the vector of amplitudes, we obtain several desired
   properties. Such a vibration suppression command is developed for a
   flexible robotic actuator, and experimental results are presented. The
   proposed command reduces residual oscillation by 73\% (rms) and 74\%
   (largest Fourier component) and represents a 37\% energy savings over
   vibration suppression commands that do not exploit the redundancy in
   actuation.}},

   fatigue life reduction in cyclically loaded notched components offer a

   a formulation that links microstructure heterogeneity (grain size

   transition crack length at which LEFM is applicable. Probabilistic
   strain-life and cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots show that
   larger notch sizes display a larger notch size effect and fatigue
   knockdown effect. The proposed CDF can be determined for any failure

   fundamental in-plane flexural mode in water has been investigated.
   Compared to cantilevers vibrating in their first out-of-plane flexural
   mode, utilizing the in-plane mode results in reduced damping and reduced
   mass loading by the surrounding fluid. Quality factors as high as 86
   have been measured in water for cantilevers with a 20 mu m thick silicon
   layer. Based on the experimental data, design guidelines are established
   for beam dimensions that ensure maximal Q-factors and minimal mass
   loading by the surrounding fluid, thus improving the limit-of-detection
   of mass-sensitive biochemical sensors. Elementary theory is also
   presented to help explain the observed trends. Additional discussion
   focuses on the tradeoffs that exist in designing liquid-phase
   biochemical sensors using in-plane cantilevers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Delamination along thin film interfaces is a prevalent failure mechanism
   in microelectronic, photonic, microelectromechanical systems, and other
   engineering applications. Current interfacial fracture test techniques
   specific to thin films are limited by either sophisticated mechanical
   fixturing, physical contact near the crack tip, or complicated stress
   fields. Moreover, these techniques are generally not suitable for
   investigating fatigue crack propagation under cyclical loading. Thus, a
   fixtureless and noncontact experimental test technique with potential
   for fatigue loading is proposed and implemented to study interfacial
   fracture toughness for thin film systems. The proposed test incorporates
   permanent magnets surface mounted onto micro-fabricated released thin
   film structures. An applied external magnetic field induces noncontact
   loading to initiate delamination along the interface between the thin
   film and underlying substrate. Characterization of the critical peel
   force and peel angle is accomplished through in situ deflection
   measurements, from which the fracture toughness can be inferred. The
   test method was used to obtain interfacial fracture strength of 0.8-1.9
   J/m(2) for 1.5-1.7 mu m electroplated copper on natively oxidized
   silicon substrates. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{After approximately 60 years of seismic quiescence within Santorini
   caldera, in January 2011 the volcano reawakened with a significant
   seismic swarm and rapidly expanding radial deformation. The deformation
   is imaged by a dense network of 19 survey and 5 continuous GPS stations,
   showing that as of 21 January 2012, the volcano has extended laterally
   from a point inside the northern segment of the caldera by about 140 mm
   and is expanding at 180 mm/yr. A series of spherical source models show
   the source is not migrating significantly, but remains about 4 km depth
   and has expanded by 14 million m(3) since inflation began. A distributed
   sill model is also tested, which shows a possible N-S elongation of the
   volumetric source. While observations of the current deformation
   sequence are unprecedented at Santorini, it is not certain that an
   eruption is imminent as other similar calderas have experienced
   comparable activity without eruption. Citation: Newman, A. V., et al.

Volume = {{209}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the environmental transport and quantify the risk of
   nanoparticles (NPs), it is important to fundamentally understand the
   aggregation of NPs and to describe this process quantitatively. This
   study investigates the aggregation kinetics of CeO2 NPs in the presence
   of KG, CaCl2 and humic acid (HA) using time-resolved dynamic light
   scattering. In KCl solutions, regardless of their concentration, HA
   drastically reduces the aggregation kinetics of CeO2 NPs. However, the
   effect of HA was more complicated in CaCl2 solutions. At low CaCl2
   concentrations, HA inhibited NP aggregation, whereas at high CaCl2
   concentrations, HA promoted aggregation. The critical coagulation
   concentration (CCC) in KCl in the absence of HA is approximately 36.5
   mM. In presence of both 1 ppm and 10 ppm HA in KCl solutions, extremely
   low aggregation kinetics were observed even at very high KCl
   concentrations (500 mM), implying KCl-CCCs in presence of HA were larger
   than 500 mM. The CCCs under conditions of no HA, 1 ppm HA and 10 ppm HA
   in CaCl2 solutions are approximately 9.5, 8.0 and 12.0 mM, respectively.
   These observations were analyzed in the framework of extended
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) theory. Moreover, a kinetic
   model was used to predict the aggregation kinetics of CeO2 NPs. The
   model predictions are in close agreement with experimental observations.
   To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to model
   quantitatively the aggregation of NPs in the presence of natural organic
   matter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{A direct consequence of the finite compressibility of a swollen microgel
   is that it can shrink and deform in response to an external
   perturbation. As a result, concentrated suspensions of these particles
   exhibit relaxation dynamics and rheological properties which can be very
   different with respect to those of a hard sphere suspension or an
   emulsion. We study the reduction in size of ionic microgels in response
   to increasing number of particles to show that particle shrinkage
   originates primarily from steric compression, and that the effect of
   ion-induced de-swelling of the polymer network is negligible. With
   increasing particle concentration, the single particle dynamics switch
   from those typical of a liquid to those of a super-cooled liquid and
   finally to those of a glass. However, the transitions occur at volume
   fractions much higher than those characterizing a hard sphere system. In
   the supercooled state, the distribution of displacements is non-Gaussian
   and the dependence of the structural relaxation time on volume fraction
   is describable by a Volger-Fulcher-Tammann function. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Membrane-Mediated Delivery of Carbon Dioxide for Consumption by
   Photoautotrophs: Eliminating Thermal Regeneration in Carbon Capture}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4673-4681}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Photoautotrophs, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, use sunlight to
   convert inorganic carbon, especially dissolved CO2 and bicarbonates, to
   organic materials, commonly biofuels or biofuel precursors. For
   large-scale biofuel production, the CO2 abundance in ambient air is not
   sufficient and CO2 must be delivered in a concentrated form, ideally
   captured from anthropogenic sources such as flue gas streams from power
   plants. Carbon dioxide capture and delivery to the photoautotrophic
   culture can add significantly to the cost of biofuels. Much of that cost
   can be attributed to the regeneration of the CO2 sorbent, a generally
   energy intensive process. Herein, a liquid-based CO2 delivery
   methodology is described and demonstrated. The system involves a
   conventional CO2 sorption system (exemplified by an amine-functionalized
   sorbent), and a carbonate stripping solution that produces a
   bicarbonate-rich solution after contacting the absorber. The latter
   solution serves as the feed stream for a CO2 selective membrane with the
   permeate side of the membrane being swept by a seawater solution,
   designed as a model for a photoautotrophic culture medium. Changes in pH
   and carbon content of the solutions, as well as the lack of any ionic
   transport across the membrane, are consistent with molecular transport
   of CO2. The CO2 flux is shown to be consistent with the chemical
   potential differential provided by the carbon-rich stripping solution
   and the carbon-depleted seawater solution. In application to biofuel
   production, the driving force would be sustained by carbon consumption
   in the photosynthetic process. Thus, photosynthesis provides much of the
   energy for the CO2 sorbent regeneration in the form of the regenerated
   carbonate stripping solution. The overall liquid-based CO2 delivery
   process described here provides the potential for a more cost-effective
   biofuel production process.}},

Abstract = {{The invasive nature of glioblastoma (GBM) represents a major clinical
   challenge contributing to poor outcomes. Invasion of GBM into healthy
   tissue restricts chemotherapeutic access and complicates surgical
   resection. Here, we test the hypothesis that an effective anti-invasive
   agent can ``contain{''} GBM and increase the efficacy of chemotherapy.
   We report a new anti-invasive small molecule, Imipramine Blue (IB),
   which inhibits invasion of glioma in vitro when tested against several
   models. IB inhibits NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species
   generation and alters expression of actin regulatory elements. In vivo,
   liposomal IB (nano-IB) halts invasion of glioma, leading to a more
   compact tumor in an aggressively invasive RT2 syngeneic astrocytoma
   rodent model. When nano-IB therapy was followed by liposomal doxorubicin
   (nano-DXR) chemotherapy, the combination therapy prolonged survival
   compared to nano-IB or nano-DXR alone. Our data demonstrate that
   nano-IB-mediated containment of diffuse glioma enhanced the efficacy of
   nano-DXR chemotherapy, demonstrating the promise of an anti-invasive
   compound as an adjuvant treatment for glioma.}},

Title = {{Enhanced cryogenic CO2 capture using dynamically operated low-cost fiber
   beds}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{97-103}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Recently Tuiniers et al. (2010) proposed a method for CO2 capture using
   cryogenically chilled packed beds with spherical packing that served as
   CO2 de-sublimation sites. The research presented here extends that work
   using fibrous packing inside the cryogenic columns, which serve to
   increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the column by up to an
   order of magnitude as well as significantly reducing the sweep gas
   pressure drop through the column. Two types of fiber were chosen to
   study the effect of surface area on the total amount of CO2 captured
   within the column: hollow cellulose acetate fibers (325 mu m OD/125 mu m
   ID) with porous walls and monofilament nylon fibers (200 mu m OD). The
   pre-chilled cellulose acetate fiber columns were able to capture 191.2
   kg of CO2/m(3) of volume at a pressure drop of 3.9 psi/ft (81.0 kPa/m)
   despite very high superficial velocities of simulated flue gas (10\% CO2
   in N-2) through the column (5,700 sccm, or 1.33 m/s). The nylon
   monofilament fibers were found to capture up to 185 kg of CO2/m(3)
   despite lower surface area than the porous cellulose acetate fibers. The
   total uptake as a function of surface area within the column was found
   to reach a maximum, which has been tentatively attributed to the limited
   amount of specific heat held within the column itself. While in actual
   operation a pure CO2 sweep may be used to recover the solid CO2 within
   the column, a N-2 sweep was used here to unequivocally demonstrate that
   the process can be used to generate a pure CO2 product. By performing a
   two-stage sweep, CO2 purities between 28 mol\% (1.33 m/s sweep) and 99.5
   mol\% (4.4 cm/s sweep) were obtained. The findings of this study suggest
   that these low-cost fibrous materials have the opportunity to reduce the
   capital expenditures of a world-scale cryogenic CO2 capture system as
   well as increase the total loading of CO2 captured per chilling cycle
   while also reducing gas compression costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Exact wave-based Bloch analysis procedure for investigating wave
   propagation in two-dimensional periodic lattices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{331}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1580-1596}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an exact, wave-based approach for determining Bloch
   waves in two-dimensional periodic lattices. This is in contrast to
   existing methods which employ approximate approaches (e.g., finite
   difference. Ritz, finite element, or plane wave expansion methods) to
   compute Bloch waves in general two-dimensional lattices. The analysis
   combines the recently introduced wave-based vibration analysis technique
   with specialized Bloch boundary conditions developed herein. Timoshenko
   beams with axial extension are used in modeling the lattice members. The
   Bloch boundary conditions incorporate a propagation constant capturing
   Bloch wave propagation in a single direction, but applied to all wave
   directions propagating in the lattice members. This results in a unique
   and properly posed Bloch analysis. Results are generated for the simple
   problem of a periodic bi-material beam, and then for the more complex
   examples of square, diamond, and hexagonal honeycomb lattices. The
   bi-material beam clearly introduces the concepts, but also allows the
   Bloch wave mode to be explored using insight from the technique. The
   square, diamond, and hexagonal honeycomb lattices illustrate application
   of the developed technique to two-dimensional periodic lattices, and
   allow comparison to a finite element approach. Differences are noted in
   the predicted dispersion curves, and therefore band gaps, which are
   attributed to the exact procedure more-faithfully modeling the finite
   nature of lattice connection points. The exact method also differs from
   approximate methods in that the same number of solution degrees of
   freedom is needed to resolve low frequency, and arbitrarily high
   frequency, dispersion branches. These advantageous features may make the
   method attractive to researchers studying dispersion characteristics,
   band gap behavior, and energy propagation in two-dimensional periodic
   lattices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1571-1580}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{A facile and objective method is introduced to automatically quantify
   the filler dispersion in polymer composites through image analysis. This
   method consists of automatic identification of the fillers in the image
   and a rigorous measurement of the filler dispersion within the space of
   functions. Compared with previous methods, this method has the
   advantages of 1) automatically recognizing the fillers, 2) minimizing
   the subjectivity induced by the inhomogeneity and noise of the
   background in the images, 3) a mathematically more rigorous definition
   of the deviation of the filler dispersion from uniformity, 4) a single
   performance metric reflecting both the distribution and the size of
   fillers. Both synthetic and real images from model compounds are used to
   demonstrate the sensitivity of the proposed method to the dispersion and
   aggregation of fillers. The computed dispersion index shows good
   agreement with visual observation of synthetic images and mechanical
   properties of the model compounds. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Title = {{Win percentage: a novel measure for assessing the suitability of machine
   classifiers for biological problems}},

Abstract = {{Background: Selecting an appropriate classifier for a particular
   biological application poses a difficult problem for researchers and
   practitioners alike. In particular, choosing a classifier depends
   heavily on the features selected. For high-throughput biomedical
   datasets, feature selection is often a preprocessing step that gives an
   unfair advantage to the classifiers built with the same modeling
   assumptions. In this paper, we seek classifiers that are suitable to a
   particular problem independent of feature selection. We propose a novel
   measure, called ``win percentage{''}, for assessing the suitability of
   machine classifiers to a particular problem. We define win percentage as
   the probability a classifier will perform better than its peers on a
   finite random sample of feature sets, giving each classifier equal
   opportunity to find suitable features.
   Results: First, we illustrate the difficulty in evaluating classifiers
   after feature selection. We show that several classifiers can each
   perform statistically significantly better than their peers given the
   right feature set among the top 0.001\% of all feature sets. We
   illustrate the utility of win percentage using synthetic data, and
   evaluate six classifiers in analyzing eight microarray datasets
   representing three diseases: breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and
   neuroblastoma. After initially using all Gaussian gene-pairs, we show
   that precise estimates of win percentage (within 1\%) can be achieved
   using a smaller random sample of all feature pairs. We show that for
   these data no single classifier can be considered the best without
   knowing the feature set. Instead, win percentage captures the non-zero
   probability that each classifier will outperform its peers based on an
   empirical estimate of performance.
   Conclusions: Fundamentally, we illustrate that the selection of the most
   suitable classifier (i.e., one that is more likely to perform better
   than its peers) not only depends on the dataset and application but also
   on the thoroughness of feature selection. In particular, win percentage
   provides a single measurement that could assist users in eliminating or
   selecting classifiers for their particular application.}},

Title = {{Controlled Conjugated Backbone Twisting for an Increased Open-Circuit
   Voltage while Having a High Short-Circuit Current in
   Poly(hexylthiophene) Derivatives}},

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Conjugated polymers with nearly planar backbones have been the most
   commonly investigated materials for organic-based electronic devices.
   More twisted polymer backbones have been shown to achieve larger
   open-circuit voltages in solar cells, though with decreased
   short-circuit current densities. We systematically impose twists within
   a family of poly(hexylthiophene)s and examine their influence on the
   performance of polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.
   A simple chemical modification concerning the number and placement of
   alkyl side chains along the conjugated backbone is used to control the
   degree of backbone twisting. Density functional theory calculations were
   carried out on a series of oligothiophene structures to provide insights
   on how the sterically induced twisting influences the geometric,
   electronic, and optical properties. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering
   measurements were performed to investigate how the thin-film packing
   structure was affected. The open-circuit voltage and charge-transfer
   state energy of the polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cells increased
   substantially with the degree of twist induced within the conjugated
   backbone-due to an increase in the polymer ionization potential-while
   the short-circuit current decreased as a result of a larger optical gap
   and lower hole mobility. A controlled, moderate degree of twist along
   the poly(3,4-dihexyl-2,2':5',2 `'-terthiophene) (PDHTT) conjugated
   backbone led to a 19\% enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (0.735 V)
   vs poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based devices, while similar short-circuit
   current densities, fill factors, and hole-carrier mobilities were
   maintained. These factors resulted in a power conversion efficiency of
   4.2\% for a PDHTT:{[}6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)
   blend solar cell without thermal annealing. This simple approach reveals
   a molecular design avenue to increase open-circuit voltage while
   retaining the short-circuit current.}},

Abstract = {{A sequential design of experiments methodology with an adaptive design
   space is proposed and implemented to optimize a nanofabrication
   technique that possesses significant uncertainty in terms of design
   region and model structure along with an engineering tolerance
   requirement. This method is termed Layers of Experiment (LoE) with
   Adaptive Combined Design (ACD) and is developed specifically for
   advanced technology processes where there is little or no foreknowledge
   of the design region and/or model structure from either mechanistic
   understanding or empirical studies. This technique was applied to
   optimize an elevated pressure, elevated temperature carbon dioxide
   (epet-CO2) nanoparticle deposition process where silver nanoparticles
   were deposited directly from an organometallic precursor in the fluid
   phase onto a silicon wafer surface. A target mean nanoparticle size of
   40 nm was chosen, with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as the
   motivating application. Using the LoE/ACD method, it was possible to
   find the process optimum for the epet-CO2 process and build a reliable
   model using only 12 experiments conducted in two sequential layers. With
   temperature as the design variable, the first layer of experiments was
   conducted in the region {[}60 degrees C, 150 degrees C], while the
   second layer was conducted in the region {[}98 degrees C, 128 degrees
   C], indicating that the LoE/ACD algorithm reduced the size of the design
   region by 60 degrees C while building a reliable model for statistical
   inference. In the first layer, a purely space-filling design was used
   since the model structure was unknown; in the second layer, the ACD
   approach yielded a design weighted between space-filling and D-optimal,
   favoring the D-optimal design. The optimized temperature for fabricating
   40 nm diameter silver nanoparticles in this system was 117 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) resulting from the oxidation of organic
   species emitted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were sampled during
   two survey flights conducted by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration WP-3D aircraft in June 2010. A new technique for fast
   measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) supersaturation spectra
   called Scanning Flow CCN Analysis was deployed for the first time on an
   airborne platform. Retrieved CCN spectra show that most particles act as
   CCN above (0.3 +/- 0.05)\% supersaturation, which increased to (0.4 +/-
   0.1)\% supersaturation for the most organic-rich aerosol sampled. The
   aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, was inferred from both
   measurements of CCN activity and from humidified-particle light
   extinction, and varied from 0.05 to 0.10 within the emissions plumes.
   However, kappa values were lower than expected from chemical composition
   measurements, indicating a degree of external mixing or size-dependent
   chemistry, which was reconciled assuming bimodal, size-dependent
   composition. The CCN droplet effective water uptake coefficient,
   gamma(cond), was inferred from the data using a comprehensive instrument
   model, and no significant delay in droplet activation kinetics from the
   presence of organics was observed, despite a large fraction of
   hydrocarbon-like SOA present in the aerosol.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{The progression of neoplastic malignancies is a complex process
   resulting not only from the accumulation of mutations within tumor
   cells, but also modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Recent
   advances have shown that the recruitment and subsequent heterotypic
   interactions of stromal cells-including fibroblasts and bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-are crucial for
   carcinogenesis. Though extensive work has been done analyzing the
   signals that recruit these cells, the governing mechanical properties
   have not been fully investigated. Here, we report that despite their
   initial similarities, MSCs respond not only faster but also more
   dramatically to pro-migratory tumor-secreted soluble factors. Utilizing
   multiple particle tracking microrheology to probe the cytoskeletal
   mechanical properties, we show that MSCs stiffen completely within one
   hour, three times faster than fibroblasts. In addition, unlike
   fibroblasts, MSCs exposed to tumor-secreted soluble factors display a
   functionally different phenotype characterized by morphological
   elongation, decreased actin stress fiber density, and decreased
   adhesion. Quantitative real-time PCR indicates these phenomena occur
   based on differential expression of small GTPases RhoA and Cdc42, but
   not Rac1. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the
   recruitment of fibroblasts and MSCs.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a closed form formulation for the impedance of the
   metal-insulator-metal (MIM) plasmonic transmission lines by solving the
   Maxwell's equations. We provide approximations for thin and thick
   insulator layers sandwiched between metallic layers. In the case of very
   thin dielectric layer, the surface waves on both interfaces are strongly
   coupled resulting in an almost linear dependence of the impedance of the
   plasmonic transmission line on the thickness of the insulator layer. On
   the other hand, for very thick insulator layer, the impedance does not
   vary with the insulator layer thickness due to the
   weak-coupling/decoupling of the surface waves on each metal-insulator
   interface. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed formulation
   using two test scenarios, namely, almost zero reflection in T-junction
   and reflection from line discontinuity in the design of Bragg
   reflectors, where we compare our formulation against previously
   published results. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{231-240}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Hyperbranched aminosilica (HAS) CO2 adsorbents are prepared by the
   ring-opening polymerization of aziridine from SBA-15 mesoporous silica,
   as in the original synthesis of HAS materials, as well as over an array
   of new support materials with substantially larger average pore
   diameters to elucidate the effect of support porosity on final adsorbent
   properties. Pore-expanded hyperbranched aminosilica (PEHAS) CO2
   adsorbents are prepared from several different pore-expanded, ordered
   mesoporous silicas including pore-expanded SBA-15, mesocellular foam,
   and a large-pore commercial silica. The effect of the nature of the
   silica support is determined by examining the degree of aziridine
   polymerization and the CO2 adsorption kinetics and capacities of the
   resulting organic/inorganic hybrid materials. Comparisons are made to
   non-pore-expanded SBA-15 based HAS adsorbents, reported previously,
   where pores become blocked at higher amine loadings. The PEHAS materials
   unexpectedly possess lower amine loadings than the previously reported
   HAS materials and do not exhibit pore blocking. The use of acetic acid
   as a catalyst during PEHAS synthesis only marginally increases amine
   loading. The adsorption kinetics of PEHAS adsorbents are similar to HAS
   adsorbents with low amine loadings and do not show the detrimental
   effects of pore-blocking. However, the inability to synthesize PEHAS
   adsorbents with high amine loadings via this approach limits the total
   amount of CO2 captured per gram of material, compared to HAS adsorbents
   with high amine loadings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel broadband beam splitter (BS) at a wavelength of 1.55 mu m is
   proposed and demonstrated, which is based on the form birefringence of
   subwavelength binary blazed grating and effective-medium theory.
   Rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) is used to optimize the design of
   this beam splitter. In order to achieve high coupling efficiency and
   equal power separation, the grating depth, period and wavelength are
   optimized, and the double-structure design which consists of symmetrical
   subwavelength gratings is adopted. Finally, the additional reflectors
   are also discussed and analyzed. Simulation results for TE polarized
   wave and TM polarized wave are presented. Using three reflectors, the BS
   for TE light are designed to split incident light beam into two beams of
   nearly equal power (41\% and 43\%), and the power difference of two
   output ports is less than 3\% over a 20 nm wavelength bandwidth range.
   Simultaneously, the coupling efficiency of TM model for the right and
   the left branches of waveguide are 33\% and 40\%, respectively. The
   power differences of two ports of waveguide are lower than 10\% with 80
   nm wavelength bandwidth. Both theoretical analysis and simulation
   results show that the beam splitter designed here has advantages of high
   coupling efficiency, compact structure and polarization independence.

Abstract = {{Core-shelled multimetallic nanoparticles have unique catalytic
   properties compared to their single-element counterparts. Due to the
   different lattice parameters of the core and shell, the strain field is
   built up at the interface between the two phases. As for thin films, a
   formation of misfit and threading dislocations is an approach to release
   interface strain. However, for two-phase nanoparticles especially when
   their sizes are at nanometer scale, their dislocation formation in the
   volume remains to be investigated owing to the large surface-to-volume
   ratio. Here, we confirmed the existence of dislocations in the Au-FePt
   core-shelled nanoparticles of sizes less than 10 urn. It is suggested
   that the different atom sizes of the core and the shell materials are
   likely to be a key factor to generate and lock dislocations inside the

Abstract = {{This study considers the approaches of Blok and Jaeger for the
   estimation of maximum and average temperatures in sliding elliptical
   contacts with both uniform and semi-ellipsoidal (Hertzian) heat
   distributions. The accuracy of each of these methods, which are based on
   single-point temperature matching between contacting bodies, is assessed
   relative to a numerical solution of the heat partition problem developed
   in a previous work, which imposed temperature matching at all nodal
   points. Comparisons are made for a wide range of Peclet numbers, as well
   as for moderate ranges of thermal conductivity ratio and elliptical
   ratio. It is found that the application of Blok's hypothesis yields
   remarkably accurate predictions of the maximum interfacial temperature,
   with typical errors less than 3\%, whereas the hypothesis of Jaeger
   leads to predictions of the average interfacial temperature that have
   typical errors of around 6\%. The authors also assess the accuracy of
   approximate formula developed by Tian and Kennedy to predict the maximum
   temperature at the interface for the case of sliding circular contacts
   and find the error to be no more than 2.6\% for the full range of Peclet
   number. Further, the authors of the current study use fundamental heat
   source solutions developed by Tian and Kennedy to arrive at formulae for
   average temperature rise for circular contacts that are analogous to the
   Tian and Kennedy maximum temperature rise formulae. It is found that the
   formulae for computing the average interfacial temperature rise are also
   quite accurate, but have slightly more error than the maximum
   temperature rise formulae. Finally, in the present work, extensions are
   suggested to the maximum and average temperature rise formulae of Tian
   and Kennedy to include the effects of elliptical contact geometry. It is
   found that these formulae are at least 91\% accurate for elliptical
   ratios between 0.4 and 5.0. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{T cells recognizing self-peptides that mediate autoimmune disease and
   those that are responsible for efficacious immunity against pathogens
   may differ in affinity for antigen due to central and peripheral
   tolerance mechanisms. Here we utilize prototypical self-reactive
   (myelin) and viral-specific (LCMV) T cells from T cell receptor (TCR)
   transgenic mice (2D2 and SMARTA, respectively) to explore affinity
   differences. The T cells responsive to virus possessed >10,000 fold
   higher 2D affinity as compared to the self-reactive T cells. Despite
   their dramatically lower affinity for their cognate ligand, 2D2 T cells
   respond with complete, albeit delayed, activation (proliferation and
   cytokine production). SMARTA activation occurs rapidly, achieving peak
   phosphorylation of p38 (1 minute), Erk (30 minutes), and Jun (3 hours)
   as well as CD69 and CD25 upregulation (3 and 6 hours, respectively),
   with a corresponding early initiation of proliferation. 2D2 stimulation
   with MOG results in altered signaling - no phospho-Erk or phospho-p38
   accumulation, significantly delayed activation kinetics of Jun (12
   hours), and delayed but sustained SHP-1 activity - as well as delayed
   CD69 and CD25 expression (12-24 hours), and slow initiation of
   proliferation. This delay was not intrinsic to the 2D2 T cells, as a
   more potent antigen with >100-fold increased 2D affinity restored rapid
   response kinetics in line with those identified for the viral antigen.
   Taken together, these data demonstrate that time can offset low TCR
   affinity to attain full activation and suggest a mechanism by which low
   affinity T cells participate in autoimmune disease.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic interactions are a critical factor in the adsorption of
   quadrupolar species such as CO2 and N-2 in metal organic frameworks
   (MOFs) and other nanoporous materials. We show how a version of the
   semiempirical charge equilibration method suitable for periodic
   materials can be used to efficiently assign charges and allow molecular
   simulations for a large number of MOFs. This approach is illustrated by
   simulating CO2 and N-2 adsorption in similar to 500 MOFs; this is the
   largest set of structures for which this information has been reported
   to date. For materials predicted by our calculations to have promising
   adsorption selectivities, we performed more detailed calculations in
   which accurate quantum chemistry methods were used to assign atomic
   point charges, and molecular simulations were used to assess molecular
   diffusivities and binary adsorption isotherms. Our results identify two
   MOFs, experimentally known to be stable upon solvent removal, that are
   predicted to show no diffusion limitations for adsorbed molecules and
   extremely high CO2/N-2 adsorption selectivities for CO2 adsorption from
   dry air and from gas mixtures typical of dry flue gas.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their special application in photovoltaics, the growth of
   one-dimensional single-crystalline TiO2 nanostructures on a flexible

   corrosion process in a strong acid solution, every single nanorod is
   etched into a number of small nanowires. Tube-shaped dye-sensitized
   solar cells are fabricated by using etched TiO2 NRs-coated CFs as the
   photoanode. An absolute energy conversion efficiency of 1.28\% has been
   demonstrated under 100 mW cm(-2) AM 1.5 illumination. This work
   demonstrates an innovative method for growing bunched TiO2 NRs on
   flexible substrates that can be applied in flexible devices for energy

Title = {{Nonlinear theoretical formulation of elastic stability criterion of
   crystal solids}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{An elastic stability criterion is generally formulated based on local
   elasticity, where the second-order elastic constants of a crystalline
   system in an arbitrary deformed state are required. While simple in
   formalism, such a formulation demands extensive computational effort in
   either an ab initio calculation or an atomistic simulation and often
   lacks clear physical interpretation. Here, we present a nonlinear
   theoretical formulation employing higher-order elastic constants beyond
   the second-order ones; the elastic constants needed in the theory are
   those at a zero stress state or in any arbitrary deformed state, many of
   which are now available. We use the published second-and higher-order
   elastic constants of several cubic crystals, including Au, Al, and Cu,
   as well as diamond-structure Si, with transcription under different
   coordinate frames, to test the stability conditions of these crystals
   under uniaxial and hydrostatic loading. The stability region, ideal
   strength, and potential bifurcation mode of those cubic crystals under
   loading are obtained using this theory. The results obtained are in good
   agreement with the results from the ab initio calculation or embedded
   atom method. The overall good quality of the results confirms the
   desired utility of this new approach to predict elastic stability and
   related properties of crystalline materials without involving intense
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling can be activated rapidly by 17
   beta-estradiol (E-2) via nontraditional signaling in ER alpha-positive
   MCF7 and ER alpha-negative HCC38 breast cancer cells and is associated
   with tumorigenicity. Additionally, E-2 has been shown to elicit
   anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells counteracting pro-apoptotic
   effects of chemotherapeutics. Supporting evidence suggests the existence
   of a membrane-associated ER that differs from the traditional receptors,
   ER alpha and ER beta. Our aim was to identify the ER responsible for
   rapid PKC activation and to evaluate downstream effects, such as
   proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. RT-PCR, Western blot, and
   immunofluorescence were used to determine the presence of ER splice
   variants in multiple cell lines. E-2 effects on PKC activity were
   measured with and without ER-blocking antibodies. Cell proliferation was
   determined by {[}H-3] thymidine incorporation, and cell viability was
   measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
   bromide, (MTT) whereas apoptosis was determined by DNA fragmentation and
   TUNEL. Quantitative RT-PCR and sandwich ELISA were used to determine the
   effects on metastatic factors. The role of membrane-dependent signaling
   in cancer cell invasiveness was examined using an in vitro assay. The
   results indicate the presence of an ER alpha splice variant, ER alpha
   36, in ER alpha-positive MCF7 and ER alpha-negative HCC38 breast cancer
   cells, which localized to plasma membranes and rapidly activated PKC in
   response to E-2, leading to deleterious effects such as enhancement of
   proliferation, protection against apoptosis, and enhancement of
   metastatic factors. These findings propose ER alpha 36 as a novel target
   for the development of therapies that can prevent progression of breast
   cancer in the primary tumor as well as during metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of lean blowout (LBO) phenomenon, along with the sensing
   and control strategies could enable the gas turbine combustor designers
   to design combustors with wider operability regimes. Sensing of
   precursor events (temporary extinction-reignition events) based on
   chemiluminescence emissions from the combustor, assessing the proximity
   to LBO and using that data for control of LBO has already been achieved.
   This work describes the fluid mechanic details of the precursor dynamics
   and the blowout process based on detailed analysis of near blowout flame
   behavior, using simultaneous chemiluminescence and droplet scatter
   observations. The droplet scatter method represents the regions of cold
   reactants and thus help track unburnt mixtures. During a precursor
   event, it was observed that the flow pattern changes significantly with
   a large region of unburnt mixture in the combustor, which subsequently
   vanishes when a double/single helical vortex structure brings back the
   hot products back to the inlet of the combustor. This helical pattern is
   shown to be the characteristic of the next stable mode of flame in the
   longer combustor, stabilized by double helical vortex breakdown (VBD)
   mode. It is proposed that random heat release fluctuations near blowout
   causes VBD based stabilization to shift VBD modes, causing the observed
   precursor dynamics in the combustor. A complete description of the
   evolution of flame near the blowout limit is presented. The description
   is consistent with all the earlier observations by the authors about
   precursor and blowout events.}},

Abstract = {{To enable sustained drug delivery, we prepared microchips of simple
   structure for drug release based on diffusion through microchannels. The
   microchips were fabricated with poly(methyl methacrylate), embedded with
   one or more microwells and microchannels of controlled length. The
   channels were filled with biocompatible polymer, poly(ethylene glycol),
   to serve as a drug diffusion barrier. The wells served as drug
   reservoirs and were filled with a fine powder of a model compound,
   fluorescein. Three different drug delivery microchip designs were
   prepared, each equipped with a channel of 1, 4, or 8 mm length. Drug
   release from these devices all exhibited a delay followed by sustained
   release over time. As the channel length increased from 1 to 8 mm, the
   onset time and duration of drug release also increased from 0.5 to 7 day
   and from 11 days to 28, respectively. We also prepared microchips
   equipped with multiple microwells, each connected to a channel of
   different length. In this way, a chip with channels of 1, 4, and 8 mm
   length exhibited a continuous drug release from 0.5 to 35 days. A future
   study is in progress to develop the microchips made of biodegradable
   materials. Therefore, we conclude that a microchip embedded with
   multiple sets of microwells and microchannels of different length can be
   designed to enable sustained drug release for controlled and prolonged
   periods of time.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{780-793}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Bayes decision theory is the foundation of the classical statistical
   pattern recognition approach, with the expected error as the performance
   objective. For most pattern recognition problems, the ``error{''} is
   conventionally assumed to be binary, i.e., 0 or 1, equivalent to error
   counting, independent of the specifics of the error made by the system.
   The term ``error rate{''} is thus long considered the prevalent system
   performance measure. This performance measure, nonetheless, may not be
   satisfactory in many practical applications. In automatic speech
   recognition, for example, it is well known that some errors are more
   detrimental (e.g., more likely to lead to misunderstanding of the spoken
   sentence) than others. In this paper, we propose an extended framework
   for the speech recognition problem with non-uniform
   classification/recognition error cost which can be controlled by the
   system designer. In particular, we address the issue of system model
   optimization when the cost of a recognition error is class dependent. We
   formulate the problem in the framework of the minimum classification
   error (MCE) method, after appropriate generalization to integrate the
   class-dependent error cost into one consistent objective function for
   optimization. We present a variety of training scenarios for automatic
   speech recognition under this extended framework. Experimental results
   for continuous speech recognition are provided to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the new approach.}},

Abstract = {{A state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system can often
   achieve high accuracy for most spoken languages of interest if a large
   amount of speech material can be collected and used to train a set of
   language-specific acoustic phone models. However, designing good ASR
   systems with little or no language-specific speech data for
   resource-limited languages is still a challenging research topic. As a
   consequence, there has been an increasing interest in exploring
   knowledge sharing among a large number of languages so that a universal
   set of acoustic phone units can be defined to work for multiple or even
   for all languages. This work aims at demonstrating that a recently
   proposed automatic speech attribute transcription framework can play a
   key role in designing language-universal acoustic models by sharing
   speech units among all target languages at the acoustic phonetic
   attribute level. The language-universal acoustic models are evaluated
   through phone recognition. It will be shown that good cross-language
   attribute detection and continuous phone recognition performance can be
   accomplished for ``unseen{''} languages using minimal training data from
   the target languages to be recognized. Furthermore, a phone-based
   background model (PBM) approach will be presented to improve attribute
   detection accuracies.}},

Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to develop a system to quantify survey data
   quality and to study pavement performance characteristics with levels of
   confidence. To address this need, a system is proposed to quantify
   historical asphalt pavement condition survey data quality. The proposed
   confidence evaluation system uses the indicators based on asphalt
   pavement life-cycle characteristics. The resulting confidence levels of
   the indicators are used to determine the confidence level of the
   analyzed pavement's life curves and performance characteristics.
   Twenty-three years of asphalt pavement condition survey data were
   provided by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) to validate
   the proposed system. The pavement's life curves that have a
   high-confidence level can be obtained and used to analyze actual
   pavement performance; the average life of resurfacing effectiveness at a
   rating of 70 is approximately 9.4 years; this closely matches GDOT
   engineers' assumption of 10 years of life, which is used for routine
   life-cycle cost analysis. The average project resurfacing time span,
   however, is 11.4 years, which indicates a 2-year lag for pavement
   preservation. More than 67 percent of the resurfacing projects are being
   delayed by more than one-year, indicating a serious problem. The derived
   load cracking propagation data indicates that this data can be used to
   support the development of reliable pavement life forecasting models.

Abstract = {{Preparing for the annual major league baseball draft is a difficult
   task; with 1,500 players selected each year, teams must evaluate and

   teams send out scouts, baseball experts who make qualitative and
   quantitative observations and report their opinions to the team.
   However, scouts often disagree significantly in their opinions. We
   worked with a major league team to model and solve the problem of
   suggesting a consensus ranking of all players scouted by the team's
   representatives. Our methodology can also make in-season recommendations
   for dynamic scout scheduling based on the level of information each
   scout is likely to provide on each player, and the uncertainty in the
   ``correct{''} overall ranking of each player. The team has been using
   the optimization tool we provided for the past two years, and a second
   major league team has also asked us to evaluate its ranking data.}},

Abstract = {{Video-log images are often used by state DOTs to manually or
   automatically extract roadway infrastructure information, including
   roadway geometry and signs. Poor quality images with lens debris are
   unacceptable and need to be identified before state DOTs accept the
   collections of video-log images from contractors. However, manually
   reviewing the tens of millions of video-log images to detect lens debris
   deficiencies is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic
   lens debris detection in video-log images is needed. Based on joint
   domain-range representation of lens debris candidates that are obtained
   from dark channel prior depth map estimation and Canny lens debris edge
   detection, a nonparametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) model for lens
   debris detection has been developed for the first time. The model
   detects the lens debris areas in the video-log images using recursive
   bandwidth selection and hysteresis updating strategy. An experimental
   test, using 13,007 video-log images provided by the Alberta DOT, was
   conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. Test results show that the
   proposed algorithm can detect lens debris in video-log images with a
   detection rate greater than 84\%. The proposed algorithm is promising
   for improving video-log image data quality control and assurance. DOI:

   heterojunction bipolar transistors (DHBTs) that is directly grown on a
   free-standing (FS) GaN substrate. Measured common-emitter current gain
   (h(fe)) reaches 80. A quasi-static I-V measurement shows that JC> 141
   kA/cm(2) and a power density of 3.05 MW/cm(2) can be achieved for DHBTs
   grown on an FS-GaN substrate. When the temperature is increased to 250
   degrees C, a GaN/InGaN DHBT shows h(fe) = 43 and the offset voltage is
   reduced from 0.8 V at the room temperature to 0.3 V. Similarly, the knee
   voltage is reduced from 5.2 V at room temperature to 2.75 V at 250
   degrees C. In this particular device, breakdown voltage (BVCEO)
   increases from 90 V at room temperature to 157 V at 250 degrees C. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the modal characteristics of a latex membrane
   for micro air vehicles applications. Finite element (FE) models are
   developed for characterizing the latex membrane at dynamic loading and
   validated by experimental results. The membrane at different pre-tension
   levels is attached to a circular steel ring, mounted on a shaker, and
   placed inside the vacuum chamber for modal characterization using a
   scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The experimental modal analysis
   is conducted by imposing a structural excitation to the ring for
   investigating the membrane vibration characteristics at both atmospheric
   and reduced pressures in a vacuum chamber. FE models are developed for
   the natural frequencies of the membrane at different uniform and
   non-uniform pre-tension levels with the effect of the added mass of air.
   The Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material model is selected for the
   membrane. The natural frequencies of the membrane computed by
   experimental and FE models are correlated well, although discrepancy is
   expected among experimental and FE results within reasonable limits due
   to the variation of the thickness of the membrane. The natural
   frequencies increase with the mode and pre-tension level of the membrane
   but decrease due to an increase in ambient pressure. The damping ratios
   have very minimal effect on the frequencies due to low values but help
   to reduce the amplitude of vibration. Natural frequencies of the
   membrane do not change with the uniform and non-uniform nature of the
   pre-tension, although they increase with the pre-tension level. It is
   also found that the effect of added mass on the natural frequencies
   increases with an increase of the size of the membrane specimen. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The performance of a call center is sensitive to customer abandonment.
   In this survey paper, we focus on G / GI / n+GI parallel-server queues
   that serve as a building block to model call center operations. Such a
   queue has a general arrival process (the G), independent and identically
   distributed (iid) service times with a general distribution (the first
   GI), and iid patience times with a general distribution (the +GI).
   Following the square-root safety staffing rule, this queue can be
   operated in the quality- and efficiency-driven (QED) regime, which is
   characterized by large customer volume, the waiting times being a
   fraction of the service times, only a small fraction of customers
   abandoning the system, and high server utilization. Operational
   efficiency is the central target in a system whose staffing costs
   dominate other expenses. If a moderate fraction of customer abandonment
   is allowed, such a system should be operated in an overloaded regime
   known as the efficiency-driven (ED) regime. We survey recent results on
   the many-server queues that are operated in the QED and ED regimes.
   These results include the performance insensitivity to patience time
   distributions and diffusion and fluid approximate models as practical
   tools for performance analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Previous ultrasonic studies have demonstrated that measurements of
   material nonlinearities can provide a means for detecting early signs of
   fatigue damage using both compressional (P) and Rayleigh (R) surface
   waves. However, these experimental studies have typically been limited
   to the direct wave arrival between the source and receiver in simple
   geometries where no reflection occurs. In particular, the degree of
   material nonlinearity is often quantified by the ratio of the cumulative
   amplitude of the first harmonic to that of the fundamental for the
   direct arrival only. Hence a practical question arises over the
   interpretation of ultrasonic measurements of material nonlinearities in
   the presence of reflected nonlinear waves. Thus, this article
   investigates the reflection problem of P or R waves at the edge of a
   homogeneous plate with quadratic nonlinearity using both a theoretical
   formulation, based on perturbation analysis, and direct numerical
   simulations using a Cellular Automata formulation. The numerical
   approach is first validated against an existing theoretical formulation
   for reflecting nonlinear P waves. It is then used to simulate the
   nonlinear reflection of R waves at a plate's edge for which no
   closed-form formulation is presently available. (C) 2012 Acoustical

Abstract = {{Security services such as data confidentiality, authenticity, and
   availability are critical in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed in
   adversarial environments. Due to the resource constrain's of sensor
   nodes, the existing protocols currently in use in adhoc networks cannot
   be employed in WSNs. In this article, we propose a protocol called
   location-aware network-coding security (LNCS) that provides all the
   aforementioned security services. By dividing the terrain into
   nonoverlapping cells, the nodes take advantage of the location
   information to derive different location-binding keys. The key idea in
   LNCS is that all the nodes involved in the protocol collaborate in every
   phase. We employ random network coding in order to provide data
   availability significantly higher than that in other schemes. A hash
   tree-based authentication mechanism is utilized to filter the bogus
   packets enroute. We provide a comparison between our scheme and
   previously proposed schemes. The results reveal significant improvement
   in data availability while maintaining the same level of data
   confidentiality and authenticity.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the operational stability of low-voltage hybrid
   organic-inorganic complementary inverters with a top-gate bottom
   source-drain geometry. The inverters are comprised of p-channel
   pentacene and n-channel amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistors (TFTs)
   with bi-layer gate dielectrics formed from an amorphous layer of a
   fluoropolymer (CYTOP) and a high-k layer of Al2O3. The p- and n- channel
   TFTs show saturation mobility values of 0.1 +/- 0.01 and 5.0 +/- 0.5
   cm(2)/Vs, respectively. The individual transistors show high electrical
   stability with less than 6\% drain-to-source current variations after 1
   h direct current (DC) bias stress. Complementary inverters yield
   hysteresis-free voltage transfer characteristics for forward and reverse
   input biases with static DC gain values larger than 45 V/V at 8 V before
   and after being subjected to different conditions of electrical stress.
   Small and reversible variations of the switching threshold voltage of
   the inverters during these stress tests are compatible with the observed
   stability of the individual TFTs. Copyright 2012 Author(s). This article

Title = {{An electricity generation planning model incorporating demand response}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{429-441}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Energy policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions and change the mix
   of electricity generation sources, such as carbon cap-and-trade systems
   and renewable electricity standards, can affect not only the source of
   electricity generation, but also the price of electricity and,
   consequently, demand. We develop an optimization model to determine the
   lowest cost investment and operation plan for the generating capacity of
   an electric power system. The model incorporates demand response to
   price change. In a case study for a U.S. state, we show the price,
   demand, and generation mix implications of a renewable electricity
   standard, and of a carbon cap-and-trade policy with and without initial
   free allocation of carbon allowances. This study shows that both the
   demand moderating effects and the generation mix changing effects of the
   policies can be the sources of carbon emissions reductions, and also
   shows that the share of the sources could differ with different policy
   designs. The case study provides different results when demand

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the design, fabrication, and characterization of a
   small form factor, piezoelectrically transduced, tunable micromechanical
   resonator for real-time clock (RTC) applications (32.768 kHz). The
   device was designed to resonate in an out-of-plane flexural mode to
   simultaneously achieve low-frequency operation and reduced motional
   resistance in a small die area. Finite element simulations were
   extensively used to optimize the structure in terms of size, insertion
   loss, spurious-mode rejection, and frequency tuning. Microresonators
   with an overall die area of only 350 x 350 mu m were implemented on a
   thin-film AlN on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate with AlN thickness
   of 0.5 mu m, device layer of 1.5 mu m, and an electrostatic tuning gap
   size of 1 mu m. A frequency tuning range of 3100 ppm was measured using
   dc voltages of less than 4 V. This range is sufficient to compensate for
   frequency variations of the microresonator across temperature from -20
   degrees C to 100 degrees C. The device exhibits low motional impedance
   that is completely independent of the frequency tuning potential.
   Discrete electronics were used in conjunction with the resonator to
   implement an oscillator, verifying its functionality as a timing
   reference.}},

   and dual-task paradigms often degrade fine motor performance, but the
   effects of aging on correlated neural activity between motor cortex and
   contracting muscle are unknown during dual tasks requiring fine motor
   performance. The purpose of this study was to compare corticomuscular
   coherence between young and elderly adults during the performance of a
   unilateral fine motor task and concurrent motor and cognitive tasks.
   Twenty-nine healthy young (18-38 yr) and elderly (61-75 yr) adults
   performed unilateral motor, bilateral motor, concurrent motor-cognitive,
   and cognitive tasks. Peak corticomuscular coherence between the
   electroencephalogram from the primary motor cortex and surface
   electromyogram from the first dorsal interosseous muscle was compared
   during steady abduction of the index finger with visual feedback. In the
   alpha-band (8-14 Hz), corticomuscular coherence was greater in elderly
   than young adults especially during the motor-cognitive task. The
   beta-band (15-32 Hz) corticomuscular coherence was higher in elderly
   than young adults across unilateral motor and dual tasks. In addition,
   beta-band corticomuscular coherence in the motor-cognitive task was
   negatively correlated with motor output error across young but not
   elderly adults. The results suggest that 1) corticomuscular coherence
   was increased in senior age with a greater influence of an additional
   cognitive task in the alpha-band and 2) individuals with greater
   beta-band corticomuscular coherence may exhibit more accurate motor
   output in young, but not elderly adults, during steady contraction with
   visual feedback.}},

Abstract = {{The quality and reliability of interconnects in microelectronics is a
   major challenge considering the increasing level of integration and high
   current densities. This work studied the problem of transient Joule
   heating in interconnects in a two-dimensional (2D) inhomogeneous domain
   using the transmission line matrix (TLM) method. Computational
   efficiency of the TLM method and its ability to accept non-uniform 2D
   and 3D mesh and variable time step makes it a good candidate for
   multi-scale analysis of Joule heating in on-chip interconnects. The TLM
   method was implemented with link-resistor (LR) and link-line (LL)
   formulations, and the results were compared with a finite element (FE)
   model. The overall behavior of the TLM models were in good agreement
   with the FE model while, near the heat source, the transient TLM
   solutions developed slower than the FE solution. The steady-state
   results of the TLM and FE models were identical. The two TLM
   formulations yielded slightly different transient results, with the LL
   result growing slower, particularly at the source boundary and becoming
   unstable at short time-steps. It was concluded that the LR formulation
   is more accurate for transient thermal analysis. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to design and evaluate simple and rapid
   seismic retrofit devices for relatively small rehabilitation projects
   for steel structures. These designs are consistent with the tenets of
   sustainable design and will result in a more resilient building stock as
   well as minimizing environmental and economical effects and social
   consequences during the rehabilitation project. To achieve these goals,
   a unique approach to designing supplemental systems by using
   tension-only elements is proposed, one that eliminates undesirable
   global and local buckling. The first generation of these devices, a
   bracing system consisting of cables and a central energy dissipating
   device {[}couples resisting (CORE) damper], is presented in this paper.
   Both analytical studies with advanced and simplified models and
   proof-of-concept testing demonstrated stable, highly efficient
   performance of the system under seismic loads. Preliminary applications
   of the CORE damper system to the retrofitting of a braced steel frame
   showed the ability of the system to minimize soft story failures and

Abstract = {{Scaffolds constitute an essential structural component in tissue
   engineering of a vascular substitute for small grafts by playing a
   significant role in integrating the overall tissue constructs. The
   microstructure and mechanical properties of such scaffolds are important
   parameters to promote further cellular activities and neo-tissue
   development. Cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs), an abundant, biocompatible
   material, could potentially constitute an acceptable candidate in
   scaffolding of a tissue-engineered vessel. Inspired by the advantages of
   cellulose and its derivatives, we have designed a biomaterial comprising
   CNWs embedded in a matrix of cellulose acetate propionate to fabricate a
   fully bio-based scaffold. To ensure uniform distribution, CNWs were
   delicately extracted from a multi-stage process and dispersed in an
   acetone suspension prior to the composite fabrication. Comparable to
   carbon nanotubes or kevlar, CNWs impart significant strength and
   directional rigidity even at 0.2 wt\% and almost double that at only 3.0
   wt\%. To ensure the accuracy of our experimental data and to predict the
   unusual reinforcing effect of CNWs in a cellulose-based composite,
   homogenization schemes such as the mean field approach and the
   percolation technique were also investigated. Based on these
   comparisons, the tendency of CNWs to interconnect with one another
   through strong hydrogen bonding confirmed the formation of a
   three-dimensional rigid percolating network, fact which imparted an
   excellent mechanical stability to the entire structure at such low
   filler contents. Hence, our fibrous porous microstructure with improved
   mechanical properties could introduce a potential scaffold to withstand
   the physiological pressure and to mimic the profile features of native
   extracellular matrix in a human vessel. We believe that our nanohybrid
   design not only could expand the biomedical applications of renewable
   cellulose-based materials but also could provide a potential scaffold
   candidate in tissue engineering of small diameter grafts. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This paper describes a two-limb single-pass modeling approach
   constrained by vent temperature, heat flow, vent geochemistry,
   active-source seismology, and seismically inferred circulation geometry
   to provide first-order constraints on crustal permeability, conductive
   boundary layer thickness, fluid residence times, and magma replenishment
   rates for the magma-hydrothermal system at the East Pacific Rise (EPR)
   near 9 degrees 50'N. Geochemical data from black smokers and nearby
   diffuse-flow patches, as well as an estimate of heat flow partitioning,
   suggest that nearly 90\% of the heat output stems from heat supplied by
   the subaxial magma chamber, even though almost 90\% of that output
   appears as diffuse flow at the seafloor. Estimates of magma
   replenishment rates are consistent with the evolution of lava chemistry
   over the eruption cycle between 1991-1992 and 2005-2006. If the recharge
   surface area is 10(5) m(2), a one-dimensional model of hydrothermal
   recharge using EPR 9 degrees 50'N parameters gives rise to rapid sealing
   as a result of anhydrite precipitation; however, if the area of recharge

Abstract = {{Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are conduits of heat and chemicals from the
   lithosphere to the hydrosphere. Their plumes rise hundreds of meters
   from the seafloor into the water column; during their ascent, they
   entrain ambient water and are subject to cross flows. Source fluxes can
   vary in time, partly in response to seismic and magmatic events.
   Long-term measurements of physical properties of hydrothermal plumes
   provide windows to conditions within Earth's interior. This article
   provides examples of long-term measurements of acoustic scattering
   recorded along Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Acoustic
   backscatter data from particles and temperature fluctuations provide
   information on width, shape, and vertical velocity in the plumes from
   which entrainment and upward transport are estimated. Acoustic forward
   scatter by turbulence within the plume gives time series of the plume's
   path-averaged vertical velocity and temperature fluctuations and
   exhibits variability that is dependent on the ambient horizontal flow.
   At several vents, direct measurements of heat flux using in situ devices
   and video imagery have yielded an integrated heat output for various
   sulfide structures. In conjunction with these measurements, plume models
   that incorporate ambient stratification and horizontal tidal flows are
   yielding insights into the vertical and azimuthal dependence of
   entrainment, rise-height variability, and plume bending.}},

Title = {{Osteoblasts exhibit a more differentiated phenotype and increased bone
   morphogenetic protein production on titanium alloy substrates than on
   poly-ether-ether-ketone}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Multiple biomaterials are clinically available to
   spine surgeons for performing interbody fusion. Poly-ether-ether-ketone
   (PEEK) is used frequently for lumbar spine interbody fusion, but
   alternative materials are also used, including titanium (Ti) alloys.
   Previously, we showed that osteoblasts exhibit a more differentiated
   phenotype when grown on machined or grit-blasted titanium aluminum
   vanadium (Ti6Al4V) alloys with micron-scale roughened surfaces than when
   grown on smoother Ti6Al4V surfaces or on tissue culture polystyrene
   (TCPS). We hypothesized that osteoblasts cultured on rough Ti alloy
   substrates would present a more mature osteoblast phenotype than cells
   cultured on PEEK, suggesting that textured Ti6Al4V implants may provide
   a more osteogenic surface for interbody fusion devices.
   PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to compare osteoblast response
   to smooth Ti6Al4V (sTiAlV) and roughened Ti6Al4V (rTiAlV) with their
   response to PEEK with respect to differentiation and production of
   factors associated with osteogenesis.
   STUDY DESIGN: This in vitro study compared the phenotype of human MG63
   osteoblast-like cells cultured on PEEK, sTiAlV, or rTiAlV surfaces and
   their production of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).
   METHODS: Surface properties of PEEK, sTiAlV, and rTiAlV discs were
   determined. Human MG63 cells were grown on TCPS and the discs. Confluent
   cultures were harvested, and cell number, alkaline phosphatase-specific
   activity, and osteocalcin were measured as indicators of osteoblast
   maturation. Expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for BMP2 and BMP4 was
   measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Levels of BMP2, BMP4,
   and BMP7 proteins were also measured in the conditioned media of the
   cell cultures.
   RESULTS: Although roughness measurements for sTiAlV (S-a=0.09 +/- 0.01),
   PEEK (S-a=0.43 +/- 0.07), and rTiAlV (S-a=1.81 +/- 0.51) varied,
   substrates had similar contact angles, indicating comparable
   wettability. Cell morphology differed depending on the surface. Cells
   cultured on Ti6Al4V had lower cell number and increased alkaline
   phosphatase specific activity, osteocalcin, BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 levels
   in comparison to PEEK. In particular, roughness significantly increased
   the mRNA levels of BMP2 and BMP4 and secreted levels of BMP4.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that rTiAlV substrates increase
   osteoblast maturation and produce an osteogenic environment that
   contains BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7. The results show that modifying surface
   structure is sufficient to create an osteogenic environment without
   addition of exogenous factors, which may induce better and faster bone
   during interbody fusion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent metal oxides, In particular, indium tin oxide (ITO), are I
   critical transparent contact materials for applications in
   next-generation organic electronics, including organic light emitting
   diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Understanding and
   controlling the surface properties of ITO allows for the molecular
   engineering of the ITO organic interface, resulting in fine control of
   the interfacial chemistries and electronics. In particular, both surface
   energy matching and work function compatibility at material interfaces
   can result in marked improvement in OLED and OPV performance. Although
   there are numerous ways to change the surface properties of ITO, one of
   the more successful surface modifications is the use of monolayers based
   on organic molecules with widely variable end functional groups.
   Phosphonic acids (PAs) are known to bind strongly to metal oxides and
   form robust monolayers on many different metal oxide materials. They
   also demonstrate several advantages over other functionalizing moieties
   such as silanes or carboxylic acids. Most notably, PAs can be stored in
   ambient conditions without degradation, and the surface modification
   procedures
   This Account focuses on our research studying PA binding to ITO, are
   typically robust and easy to employ. the tunable properties of the
   resulting surfaces, and subsequent effects on the performance of organic
   electronic devices. We have used surface characterization techniques
   such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared reflection
   adsorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) to determine that PAs bind to ITO in a
   predominantly bidentate fashion (where two of three oxygen atoms from
   the PA are involved in surface binding). Modification of the functional
   R-groups on PAs allows us to control and tune the surface energy and
   work function of the ITO surface. In one study using fluorinated benzyl
   PM, we can keep the surface energy of ITO relatively low and constant
   but tune the surface work function. PA modification of ITO has resulted
   in materials that are more stable and more compatible with subsequently
   deposited organic materials, an effective work function that can be
   tuned by over 1 eV, and energy barriers to hole injection (OLED) or
   hole-harvesting (OPV) that can be well matched to the frontier orbital
   energies of the organic active layers, leading to better overall device
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{AASHTO specifications provide vertical thermal gradients for the thermal
   design of precast, prestressed concrete bridge girders. However, the
   thermal behavior of the girders pertains to not only vertical thermal
   movement but also lateral thermal movement. Thus, a one-year
   experimental and analytical study was conducted on a prestressed
   concrete BT-1600 girder segment to investigate both the vertical and
   lateral thermal gradients with variations in environmental conditions.
   The vertical thermal gradients were compared using current AASHTO
   recommendations. In addition, this study evaluated the lateral thermal
   gradients, which are not provided in the specifications, to propose a
   second-order curve. To determine the magnitudes of the thermal gradients
   in different environmental conditions, this study has developed
   equations that calculate the maximum vertical and lateral temperature
   differentials from daily climatic information. Results of the study
   showed that the predicted temperature differentials provided good
   agreement with the measured values. Finally, thermal deformations
   induced by the vertical and lateral thermal gradients were evaluated
   using an analytical method derived from one-dimensional beam theory.}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterial scaffolds functionalized to stimulate endogenous repair
   mechanisms via the incorporation of osteogenic cues offer a potential
   alternative to bone grafting for the treatment of large bone defects. We
   first quantified the ability of a self-complementary adeno-associated
   viral vector encoding bone morphogenetic protein 2 (scAAV2.5-BMP2) to
   enhance human stem cell osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In
   two-dimensional culture, scAAV2.5-BMP2-transduced human mesenchymal stem
   cells (hMSCs) displayed significant increases in BMP2 production and
   alkaline phosphatase activity compared with controls. hMSCs and human
   amniotic-fluid-derived stem cells (hAFS cells) seeded on
   scAAV2.5-BMP2-coated three-dimensional porous polymer
   Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds also displayed significant
   increases in BMP2 production compared with controls during 12 weeks of
   culture, although only hMSC-seeded scaffolds displayed significantly
   increased mineral formation. PCL scaffolds coated with scAAV2.5-BMP2
   were implanted into critically sized immunocompromised rat femoral
   defects, both with or without pre-seeding of hMSCs, representing ex vivo
   and in vivo gene therapy treatments, respectively. After 12 weeks,
   defects treated with acellular scAAV2.5-BMP2-coated scaffolds displayed
   increased bony bridging and had significantly higher bone ingrowth and
   mechanical properties compared with controls, whereas defects treated
   with scAAV2.5-BMP2 scaffolds pre-seeded with hMSCs failed to display
   significant differences relative to controls. When pooled, defect
   treatment with scAAV2.5-BMP2-coated scaffolds, both with or without
   inclusion of pre-seeded hMSCs, led to significant increases in defect
   mineral formation at all time points and increased mechanical properties
   compared with controls. This study thus presents a novel acellular
   bone-graft-free endogenous repair therapy for orthotopic
   tissue-engineered bone regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic potency of delivered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in
   tissue engineering applications may be improved by priming cells toward
   a differentiated state via coculture with native, differentiated cells
   prior to implantation; however, there is a lack of understanding in what
   may be the most efficacious method. The objective of this study was to
   investigate the role of negatively-charged heparin in priming
   hydrogel-encapsulated MSCs toward the osteoblastic lineage during
   coculture with a monolayer of osteoblasts in the absence of
   dexamethasone. MSCs encapsulated with higher amounts of heparin and
   cocultured with osteoblasts exhibited an over 36-fold increase in
   alkaline phosphatase activity and 13-fold increase in calcium
   accumulation by day 21, compared to MSCs cocultured with MSCs at the
   same heparin content. Moreover, hydrogels with higher amounts of heparin
   and cocultured with osteoblasts exhibited enhanced mineralization on the
   edges, suggesting that heparin may be important in sequestering
   osteoblast-secreted soluble factors, particularly on the surfaces of
   hydrogels. The ability of heparin to selectively interact with soluble
   positively-charged proteins from the surroundings was confirmed through
   protein labeling and microscopy. These results suggest that
   heparin-containing hydrogels as part of a coculture system can be
   utilized as a versatile platform to study and enhance priming of MSCs
   toward various cell types for a wide variety of regenerative
   medicine-based therapies.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for successful bone tissue engineering
   strategies and advanced biomaterials that mimic the structure and
   function of native tissues carry great promise. Successful bone repair
   approaches may include an osteoconductive scaffold, osteoinductive
   growth factors, cells with an osteogenic potential and capacity for
   graft vascularisation. To increase osteoinductivity of biomaterials, the
   local combination and delivery of growth factors has been developed. In
   the present study we investigated the osteogenic effects of calcium
   phosphate (CaP)-coated nanofiber mesh tube-mediated delivery of BMP-7
   from a PRP matrix for the regeneration of critical sized segmental bone
   defects in a small animal model. Bilateral full-thickness diaphyseal
   segmental defects were created in twelve male Lewis rats and nanofiber
   mesh tubes were placed around the defect. Defects received either
   treatment with a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube (n=6), an un-coated
   nanofiber mesh tube (n=6) a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube with PRP
   (n=6) or a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube in combination with 5 mu g
   BMP-7 and PRP (n=6). After 12 weeks, bone volume and biomechanical
   properties were evaluated using radiography, microCT, biomechanical
   testing and histology. The results demonstrated significantly higher
   biomechanical properties and bone volume for the BMP group compared to
   the control groups. These results were supported by the histological
   evaluations, where BMP group showed the highest rate of bone
   regeneration within the defect. In conclusion, BMP-7 delivery via PRP
   enhanced functional bone defect regeneration, and together these data
   support the use of BMP-7 in the treatment of critical sized defects.}},

Abstract = {{While traditional cell culture methods have relied on growing cells as
   monolayers, three-dimensional (3D) culture systems can provide a
   convenient in vitro model for the study of complex cell-cell and
   cell-matrix interactions in the absence of exogenous substrates and may
   benefit the development of regenerative medicine strategies. In this
   study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) spheroids, or ``mesenspheres{''}, of
   different sizes, were formed using a forced aggregation technique and
   maintained in suspension culture for extended periods of time
   thereafter. Cell proliferation and differentiation potential within
   mesenspheres and dissociated cells retrieved from spheroids were
   compared to conventional adherent monolayer cultures. Mesenspheres
   maintained in growth medium exhibited no evidence of cell necrosis or
   differentiation, while mesenspheres in differentiation media exhibited
   differentiation similar to conventional 2D culture methods based on
   histological markers of osteogenic and adipogenic commitment.
   Furthermore, when plated onto tissue culture plates, cells that had been
   cultured within mesenspheres in growth medium recovered morphology
   typical of cells cultured continuously in adherent monolayers and
   retained their capacity for multilineage differentiation potential. In
   fact, more robust matrix mineralization and lipid vacuole content were
   evident in recovered MSCs when compared to monolayers, suggesting
   enhanced differentiation by cells cultured as 3D spheroids. Thus, this
   study demonstrates the development of a 3D culture system for
   mesenchymal stem cells that may circumvent limitations associated with
   conventional monolayer cultures and enhance the differentiation
   potential of multipotent cells.}},

Abstract = {{Functional dye molecules, such as porphyrins, attached to CdSe quantum
   dots (QDs) through anchoring meso-pyridyl substituents, form
   quasi-stable nanoassemblies. This fact results in photoluminescence (PL)
   quenching of the QDs both due to Forster resonance energy transfer
   (FRET) and the formation of non-radiative surface states under
   conditions of quantum confinement (non-FRET). The formation process is
   in competition with the ligand dynamics. At least two timescales are
   found for the formation of the assemblies: 1) one faster than 60 s
   attributed to saturation of empty attachment sites and 2) one slower
   than 600 s, which is attributed to a reorganisation of the
   tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) ligand shell. Finally, this process
   results in almost complete exchange of the TOPO shell by porphyrin dye
   molecules. Following a SternVolmer analysis, we established a
   microscopic description of PL quenching and assembly formation. Based on
   this formalism, we determined the equilibrium constant for assembly
   formation between QDs and the pyridyl-functionalised dye molecules to be
   K approximate to 10(5)-10(7) M-1, which is several orders of magnitude
   larger than that of the TOPO ligands. Our results give additional
   insights into the non-FRET PL quenching processes involved and show that
   the QD surface is inhomogeneous with respect to the involved attachment
   and detachment processes. In comparison with other methods, such as NMR
   spectroscopy, the advantage of our approach is that ligand dynamics can
   be investigated at extremely low ratios of dye molecules to QDs.}},

Abstract = {{Propagation and inundation characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami on
   the central Sanriku coast are investigated through field surveys and
   numerical simulations using offshore wave recordings as incident wave
   conditions. The numerical model successfully reproduces the extent of
   flood areas as well as the distribution of tsunami heights along the
   intricate coastline except for run-up of extreme heights over steep
   slopes. The survey and computed results suggest significant variations
   of tsunami heights along the coastline. Their positive dependency on
   topographic slopes implies that the incoming tsunami propagates in
   standing wave mode to precipitous sites while in progressive wave mode
   accompanied by wave breaking over gentle slopes. Temporal-spatial
   analysis of wave properties in different bays reveals that the inner bay
   topography provides a clear contrast to inundation characteristics. The
   impacting waves have extreme heights due to the funnel effect and local
   wave resonances causing highly transient flooding in narrow V-shaped
   bays whereas tsunami surges over longer periods across innermost shores
   of U-shaped bays to produce large horizontal velocities during both
   run-up and backwash phases.}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic seismic analysis of structures involves the construction
   of seismic demand models, often stated as probabilistic models of
   structural response conditioned on a seismic intensity measure. The
   uncertainty introduced by the model is often a result of the chosen
   intensity measure. This paper introduces the concept of using fractional
   order intensity measures (IMs) in probabilistic seismic demand analysis
   and uses a single frame integral concrete box-girder bridge class and a
   seismically designed multispan continuous steel girder bridge class as
   case studies. The fractional order IMs considered include peak ground
   response and spectral accelerations at 0.2 and 1.0?s considering a
   single degree of freedom system with fractional damping, Sad-Tna, as
   well as a linear single degree of freedom system with fractional
   response, Sar-Tna. The study reveals the advantage of fractional order
   IMs relative to conventional IMs such as peak ground acceleration, peak
   ground velocity, or spectral acceleration at 0.2 and 1.0?s. Metrics such
   as efficiency, sufficiency, practicality, and proficiency are measured
   to assess the optimal nature of fractional order IMs. The results
   indicate that the proposed fractional order IMs produce significant
   improvements in efficiency and proficiency, whereas maintaining
   practicality and sufficiency, and thus providing superior demand models
   that can be used in probabilistic seismic demand analysis. Copyright (c)

   proposed thermodynamic model has finite-time convergent trajectories to
   Lyapunov stable equilibria determined by the system initial energies.
   Finally, using the system entropy, we establish the absence of Poincare
   recurrence for our thermodynamic model and develop clear and rigorous

Abstract = {{We report the results of a mechanistic study of energy localization in a
   HMX (High Melting point eXplosive
   octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,2,3,5-tetrazocine)/Estane PBX system
   during dynamic loading. The focus is on the thermal-mechanical response
   over the strain rate range of 10(4) - 10(5) s(-1) under different
   confinement conditions. A recently developed cohesive finite element
   method is used to track and analyze the contributions to heating from
   different constituents, interfaces, deformation and fracture mechanisms,
   and internal friction. In particular, energy dissipations due to
   viscoelastic deformation, grain fracture, interfacial debonding, and
   friction along crack faces are quantified as functions of time and
   overall deformation. The materials analyzed have HMX volume fractions
   between 0.69 and 0.82. Calculations show that variation in strain rate
   can significantly affect the spatial distribution but not the overall
   number of hot spots. Higher confining stresses lead to more intense
   heating in the binder and more uniform distribution of hot spots. The
   evolution of hot spots is quantified as a function of loading condition,
   deformation and microstructural attributes. The microstructure-response
   relations obtained can be used to assess the initiation sensitivity of
   energetic composites. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Experimental investigation of symmetry properties of second harmonic
   Lamb waves}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies by multiple authors show contradictory results concerning
   the symmetry properties of second harmonic Lamb waves. This research
   experimentally investigates this symmetry issue by examining both
   symmetric (s1-s2) and anti-symmetric (a1-a2 and a2-a4) mode pairs in
   aluminum plates under the same experimental conditions. The wedge
   technique is used to generate and detect ultrasonic Lamb wave signals of
   a specific mode, and the Morlet wavelet is applied to extract the
   fundamental and second harmonic amplitudes. The measured normalized
   second harmonic amplitudes of the three different mode pairs all show a
   linear increase with propagation distance. However, the slopes of the
   two anti-symmetric mode pairs are smaller by two to three orders of
   magnitude than that of the symmetric mode pair considered. Further
   investigations of these two anti-symmetric mode pairs for plates with
   different levels of material nonlinearity reveal consistently small
   slopes that are independent of the level of material nonlinearity.
   Therefore, this research experimentally demonstrates that the second
   harmonic generation in anti-symmetric Lamb wave modes is extremely
   inefficient; this result is consistent with some recent theoretical
   predictions and thus shows that the use of these anti-symmetric modes is
   not favorable for the experimental characterization of material
   nonlinearity. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Trimethoprim (TMP) is a widely prescribed antibiotic frequently detected
   in the aquatic environment. This study investigates the reactions of TMP
   and two sub structure model compounds {[}2, 4-diamino-5-methylpyrimidine
   (DAMP) and 3, 4, 5-trimethoxytoluene (TMT)] with chlorine dioxide
   (ClO2), one of the common water disinfection oxidants, in batch
   reactors. A second-order kinetic model that incorporates the organic
   compounds' acid-base speciation can sufficiently describe the reaction
   kinetics and is used to evaluate molecules' reactive sites. TMP's
   apparent second-order rate constant (k(app)) with ClO2 ranges at 5-33
   M-1 . s(-1) from pH 2.7 to 9.1, corresponding to a half-life of 40.8 min
   at pH 7 and 1 mg/L of ClO2. The reaction's pH dependence is linked to
   protonation of the ring nitrogens on TMP's 2, 4-diaminopyrimidinyl
   moiety. Comparison among TMP, DAMP, and TMT reveals that the reactivity
   of TMP to ClO2 resides mostly in its diaminopyrimidinyl moiety at
   neutral to alkaline pH, but centers in its trimethoxybenzyl moiety at
   acidic conditions. LC/MS analysis shows that oxidation of TMP by ClO2
   generates Cl and OH substitutions at both diaminopyrimidinyl and
   trimethoxybenzyl moieties and other products. The reaction rate
   constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to model the decay
   of TMP by ClO2 in surface water samples, but overestimate the decay in
   wastewater samples. Overall, transformation of TMP by ClO2 can be
   expected under typical ClO2 disinfection conditions. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a fast algorithm, called the SpiralFFT, that
   computes samples of the 3-D discrete Fourier transform of an object of
   interest along spiral contours in frequency space. This type of sampling
   geometry is prevalent in 3-D magnetic resonance imaging, as spiral
   sampling patterns allow for rapid, uninterrupted scanning over a large
   range of frequencies. We show that parameterizing the spiral contours in
   a certain way allows us to decompose the computation into a series of
   1-D transforms, meaning that the 3-D transform is effectively separable,
   while still yielding spiral sampling patterns that are geometrically
   faithful and provide dense coverage of 3-D frequency space. We present a
   number of simulations which demonstrate that the SpiralFFT compares
   favorably to a state-of- the-art algorithm for computing general
   non-uniform discrete Fourier transforms.}},

Abstract = {{The genesis of this paper was notification to the author that he would
   receive the 2010 Rossing Prize in Acoustics Education, which carried the
   responsibility of giving a lecture at a meeting of the Acoustical
   Society of America. He decided to draw on his remembrances of writing
   several textbooks during a 40 year career as a professor to discuss the
   facets of writing that a faculty member might encounter. This paper is
   an expanded version of that lecture {[}J. H. Ginsberg, J. Acoust. Soc.
   Am. 128, 2389 (2010)]. An opening section elucidating the author's
   experiences as an author is followed by a discussion intended to
   motivate and encourage those who are undecided about taking on this
   activity. Suggestions are offered as to how to organize and proceed
   through a writing project as well as what elements should be included.
   An explanation of the author's role in the process of producing a
   printed textbook is provided. Guidance is offered as to how one can
   focus on writing a book in the face of teaching, research, and personal

Abstract = {{A previous paper {[}Ginsberg, 2006, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 119, 1954-1960]
   extended the d'Alembert solution of the one-dimensional wave equation to
   semi-infinite and finite length waveguides. The concept uses images of
   incident waves in order to describe reflection phenomena. Each image is
   algebraically related to an incident wave when the restriction to purely
   resistive terminations is met. The present paper extends the previous
   treatment from initial value problems to situations in which the
   particle velocity at a termination is specified. The discussion
   emphasizes the use of hand-drawn sketches as a method that will allow
   students at all levels to understand the basic processes of wave
   propagation and reflection. The number and complexity of the wave images
   is enhanced in a bounded waveguide, so simple numerical algorithms for
   evaluating the response of such systems also are discussed. The wave
   image technique is applied to a sequence of increasingly complicated
   systems. Suggestions are given regarding what material should be
   presented to students at various levels, and what students can be
   expected to garner from each case. The recommendation is that this
   solution method should be used to introduce students at all levels to
   basic acoustical phenomena. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Title = {{A method for defining wind turbine setback standards}},
Journal = {{WIND ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-303}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Setback distances established by regulatory authorities to minimize the
   probability of blade fragment impact with roads, structures and
   infrastructure can often have a significant impact on wind farm
   development. However, these minimum distance requirements typically rely
   on arbitrary rules of thumb and are not based on a physical or
   probabilistic analysis of blade throw. The work reported here uses a
   probabilistic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of current
   standards and to propose a new technique for determining setback
   distances. This is accomplished through the use of a dynamic model of
   wind turbine blade failure coupled with Monte Carlo simulation
   techniques applied to three different wind turbines. It is first shown
   that common setback standards based on turbine height and blade radius
   provide inconsistent and inadequate protection against blade throw.
   Then, using a simplified dynamic analysis of a thrown blade fragment, it
   is shown that the release velocity of the blade fragment is the critical
   factor in determining the maximum distance fragments are likely to
   travel. The importance of release velocity is further verified through
   simulation results. Finally, a new method for developing setback
   standards is proposed based on an acceptable level of risk. Given
   specific wind turbine operational parameters and a set of failure
   probabilities, the new method leverages realistic blade throw modeling
   to produce setback standards with a valid physical foundation. Copyright

Abstract = {{We report mechanical behavior and strain rate dependence of
   recoverability and energy dissipation in vertically aligned carbon
   nanotube (VACNT) bundles subjected to quasi-static uniaxial compression.
   We observe three distinct regimes in their stress-strain curves for all
   explored strain rates from 4 x 10(-2) down to 4 x 10(-4) /sec (1) a
   short initial elastic section followed by (2) a sloped plateau with
   characteristic wavy features corresponding to buckle formation and (3)
   densification characterized by rapid stress increase. Load-unload cycles
   reveal a stiffer response and virtually 100\% recoverability at faster
   strain rates of 0.04/sec, while the response is more compliant at slower
   rates, characterized by permanent localized budding and significantly
   reduced recoverability. We propose that it is the kinetics of attractive
   adhesive interactions between the individual carbon nanotubes within the
   VACNT matrix that governs morphology evolution and ensuing
   recoverability. In addition, we report a 6-fold increase In elastic
   modulus and gradual decrease In recoverability (down to 50\%) when VACNT
   bundles are unloaded from postdensification stage as compared with
   predensification. Finally, we demonstrate energy dissipation capability,
   as revealed by hysteresis in load-unload cycles. These findings,
   together with high thermal and electrical conductivities, position
   VACNTs in the ``unattained-as-of-to-date-space{''} in the material
   property landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report the synthesis of Pd@Cu core-shell nanocubes via epitaxial
   growth, where the lattice mismatch is 7.1\%. The synthesis involved the
   use of Pd seeds with different shapes (including cubes, cuboctahedra,
   and octahedra) for the epitaxial growth of Cu shells. Different from the
   conventional growth mode, Cu atoms initially nucleated only on a few of
   the many faces of a Pd seed, onto which more Cu atoms were continuously
   added to generate Cu blocks. Later, the Cu atoms also started to
   nucleate and grow on other faces of the Pd seed until the entire surface
   of the seed was covered by a Cu shell. As a result, the Pd seed was
   rarely located in the center of each core-shell structure. The final
   product took a cubic shape enclosed by \{100\} facets regardless of the
   type of Pd seeds used because of the selective capping of Cu(100)
   surface by hexadecylamine. The edge lengths of the Pd@Cu nanocubes could
   be tuned from 50 to 100 nm by varying the amount of Pd seeds while
   keeping the amount of CuCl2 precursor.}},

Abstract = {{Single crystalline PbZr0.2Ti0.8 (PIT) nanowires arrays (NWAs) with taper
   morphology were epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrate using pulse
   laser deposition. The taper morphology was attributed to the overcoating
   of PIT layer via a lateral growth of Pit clusters/adatoms during PIT NW
   growth.. The growth window for PZT film or nanowire was systematically
   studied at varied temperatures and pressures. The proposed growth
   mechanism of the taper PIT NWAs was investigated from a layer by layer
   growth via Frank-Van Der Merwe growth, followed by a formation of
   three-dimensional islands via Stranski-Krastanow growth, and then axial
   growth on the lowest energy (001) plane with growth direction of {[}001]
   via vapor-solid growth mechanism. However, under certain conditions such
   as at higher or lower pressure (>400 or <200 mTorr) or substrate
   temperatures (>850 degrees C and <725 degrees C), formation of the PIT
   NWs is suppressed while the epltaxial Pit thin film via the
   layer-by-layer growth remains. The controllable growth directions of the
   PZT NWAs on (001), (110), and (111) STO substrates were demonstrated.
   The piezopotential of the taper PIT NWAs using a conducting atomic force
   microscope with the average voltage output of similar to 18 mV was
   measured. The theoretical piezopotential of a PIT NW was calculated to
   compare with the measured outputs, providing a comprehensively
   experimental and theoretical understanding of the piezoelectricity for
   the PZT NW.}},

Abstract = {{With the forecast increase in air traffic demand over the next decades,
   it is imperative to develop tools to provide traffic flow managers with
   the information required to support decision making. In particular,
   decision-support tools for traffic flow management should aid in
   limiting controller workload and complexity, while supporting increases
   in air traffic throughput. To (late, many decision-support tools exist
   to provide strategic, operational, and tactical decision-information for
   managing aircraft counts within airspaces across the National Airspace
   System. Lacking, however, are tools that address the operational needs
   in describing the spatial distribution and complexity of air traffic
   within a center for medium- and long-term planning horizons of 30 min
   and beyond. This paper seeks to address this gap through the
   introduction of three-dimensional aircraft proximity maps that evaluate
   the future probability of presence of aircraft at any given point of the
   airspace. Three types of proximity maps are presented: 1) presence maps
   that indicate the local density of traffic, 2) conflict maps that
   highlight locations of potential conflicts and their corresponding
   probabilities, and 3) outlier proximity maps that give an image of the
   probability of close proximity between aircraft belonging and aircraft
   not belonging (so-called ``outliers{''}) to dominant flows of traffic.
   These maps provide traffic flow managers with information relating to
   the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace. The intended
   purpose of the maps is to anticipate how aircraft flows interact, and
   how outliers impact the dominant traffic flow for a given time period.
   The proximity maps are able to predict which critical regions may be
   subject to potential conflicts between aircraft, thereby requiring
   careful monitoring and additional effort to manage the airspace by air
   traffic controllers. The proximity maps are created using a generative
   air traffic flow model. Time-varying flow characteristics, such as the
   geometric configuration, aircraft speed distributions, and aircraft
   spatial distributions within the flow, are determined from archived
   Enhanced Traffic Management System data with support of a tailored
   clustering algorithm. The use of the maps is presented on a couple of
   ``what-if{''} scenarios.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{There are a number of peculiar aspects to parafoil and payload systems
   that make it difficult to apply conventional system identification
   procedures used for aerospace systems. Parafoil and payload systems are
   unique because typically there is very little sensor information
   available, the sensors that are available are separated from the canopy
   by a complex network of flexible rigging, the systems are very sensitive
   to wind and turbulence, the systems exhibit a number of nonlinear
   behaviors, and the systems exhibit a high degree of variability from
   flight to flight. The current work describes a robust system
   identification procedure developed to address the specific difficulties
   posed by airdrop systems. By employing a two-phase approach that
   separately considers atmospheric winds estimation and aerodynamic
   coefficient estimation, a nonlinear, 6-degree-of-freedom dynamic
   simulation model is generated using only Global Positioning System data
   from the flight test. The key to this approach is the use of a
   simplified aerodynamic representation of the canopy, which requires
   identification of only the steady-state response to control input to
   completely define the dynamic model. The proposed procedure is
   demonstrated by creating a simulation model using Global Positioning
   System data from actual flight tests. To validate the procedure, the
   dynamic response of the simulation model is then compared to inertial
   measurement unit data that were not used in any way to develop the
   simulation model, with excellent results.}},

Abstract = {{Group communication services (GCSs) are becoming increasingly important
   as a wide field of promising applications has emerged to serve millions
   of users distributed across the world. However, it is challenging to
   make the service fault tolerance and scalable to fulfill the voluminous
   demand of users in a distributed network (DN). While many reliable group
   communication protocols have been dedicated to addressing such a
   challenge so as to accommodate the changes in the network, they are
   often costly or require complicated strategies to handle the service
   interruptions caused by node departures or link failures, which hinders
   the service practicability. In this paper, we present two schemes to
   address the challenges. The first one is a location-aware replication
   scheme called NS, which makes replicas in a dispersed fashion that
   enables the services on nodes to gain immunity of failures with
   different patterns (e.g., network partition and single point failure)
   while keeping replication overhead low. The second one is a novel
   failure recovery scheme that exploits the independence between service
   recovery and structure recovery in time domain to achieve quick failure
   recovery. Our simulation results indicate that the two proposed schemes
   outperform the existing schemes and simple alternative schemes in
   service success rate, recovery latency, and communication cost.}},

Journal = {{MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{523-533}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Based on the proposition that leasing is environmentally superior to
   selling, some firms have adopted a leasing strategy and others promote
   their existing leasing programs as environmentally superior to
   ``green{''} their image. The argument is that because a leasing firm
   retains ownership of the off-lease units, it has an incentive to
   remarket them or invest in designing a more durable product, resulting
   in a lower volume of new production and disposal. However, leasing might
   be environmentally inferior because of the direct control the firm has
   over the off-lease products, which may prompt the firm to remove them
   from the market to avoid cannibalizing the demand for new products.
   Motivated by these issues, we adopt a life-cycle environmental impact
   perspective and analytically investigate if leasing can be both more
   profitable and have a lower total environmental impact. We find that
   leasing can be environmentally worse despite remarketing all off-lease
   products and greener than selling despite the mid-life removal of
   off-lease products. Our analysis also provides insights for
   environmental groups and entities that use different approaches to
   improve the environmental performance of business practices. We show
   that imposing disposal fees or encouraging remanufacturing, under some
   conditions, can actually lead to higher environmental impact. We also
   identify when educating consumers to be more environmentally conscious
   can improve the relative environmental performance of leasing.}},

Abstract = {{An approach for microfabricating precisely defined spherical 3-D domes
   through a simple low-temperature polymer reflow process was developed.
   Release of a thin metal film patterned over the domed structure was
   accomplished by the removal of the underlying polymer using two
   different methods: dry thermal decomposition and wet supercritical
   release. The domed shape impacted the effect of stiction during the
   release step and assisted in the release of large millimeter-size film
   geometries. The dome and release procedures were used to fabricate an
   experimental test specimen that functions as either a tensile or
   interfacial fracture test for thin films on rigid substrates. Other
   potential applications of the domed metal structures such as compliant
   electrical interconnects are discussed.}},

   the catalytic activity toward electrochemical oxidation. Peak power

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general harmonic balance method for studying plane
   wave propagation in strongly nonlinear periodic media. The proposed
   approach starts by assuming a multi-wavenumber and frequency solution
   for the unit cell degrees of freedom. A Galerkin projection then
   transforms the nonlinear differential equations of motion into a set of
   nonlinear algebraic equations, which are subsequently solved numerically
   through a Newton-like iteration scheme. These solutions reveal
   amplitude-dependent dispersion behavior and group velocities. Specific
   example systems studied include one-dimensional chains and
   two-dimensional lattices, both formed by a periodic arrangement of
   spheres interacting under a Hertzian contact law. Amplitude-dependent
   dispersion is noted in monatomic and diatomic chains, and in hexagonally
   close-packed two-dimensional lattices. The validity of the presented
   technique is assessed through direct numerical simulation of the
   equations governing finite-extent lattices. Strong agreement is
   documented for results calculated using the harmonic balance approach
   and the direct numerical simulations. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Biosynthetic strategies for the production of recombinant elastin-like
   protein (ELP) triblock copolymers have resulted in elastomeric protein
   hydrogels, formed through rapid physical crosslinking upon warming of
   concentrated solutions. However, the strength of physically crosslinked
   networks can be limited, and options for non-toxic chemical crosslinking
   of these networks are not optimal. In this report, we modify two
   recombinant elastin-like proteins with aldehyde and hydrazide
   functionalities. When combined, these modified recombinant proteins
   self-crosslink through hydrazone bonding without requiring initiators or
   producing by-products. Crosslinked materials are evaluated for water
   content and swelling upon hydration, and subject to tensile and
   compressive mechanical tests. Hydrazone crosslinking is a viable method
   for increasing the mechanical strength of elastin-like protein polymers,
   in a manner that is likely to lend itself to the biocompatible in situ
   formation of chemically and physically crosslinked ELP hydrogels. (c)

   Identification of failure profile based on failure-time data collected

   profile identification come from time-varying and limited failure-time

   maximum likelihood method. In addition, statistical hypothesis testing
   procedures are proposed to inspect the existence of a dominating failure

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for miniaturization, for instance in the cooling
   of compact electronic components, has led to research on two-phase flow
   in minichannels. The present study addresses void fractions for
   two-phase flow of refrigerant R-134a in minichannels during
   condensation, which is especially important for heat rejection to the
   ambient. In Part I of this investigation, a review of the
   state-of-the-art in void fraction measurement and modeling techniques is
   presented. Several measurement techniques are discussed and compared
   including their advantages and disadvantages for use in mini and
   micro-channels. Particular attention is given to image analysis
   techniques related to those used in Part II of this study. Numerous
   techniques, physical and empirical bases for modeling void fraction are
   categorized and comparisons of the strengths, applicability, and
   validity are given. The need for research that motivates Part II of this
   study concludes this review. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.}},

Abstract = {{This study used two forms of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires,
   nickel-titanium-niobium (NiTiNb) and nickle-titatanium (NiTi), to
   retrofit reinforced concrete (RC) columns with lap splices. NiTiNb shape
   memory alloys are considered to show a wider temperature window compared
   with NiTi shape memory alloys and thus may be beneficial for
   applications in the area of civil structures. The goals of this study
   are to assess the mechanical behaviour of the two shape memory alloy
   wires and investigate the seismic performance of the shape memory alloy
   wire jackets for reinforced concrete columns with lap splices. First,
   the study investigates the recovery and the residual stress of NiTiNb
   and NiTi shape memory alloy wires. This study also evaluates the
   behaviour of the NiTiNb shape memory alloy wire under residual stresses.
   The results indicate that the shape memory alloy wire jackets show good
   performance for reinforced concrete columns with lap splices. The shape
   memory alloy wire jackets increase the ductile behaviour of the
   lap-spliced columns without strength degradation. The results show that
   their performance is superior to that of the RC column with continuous
   reinforcements. The study shows that the NiTiNb shape memory alloy wire
   jackets are more adaptive for retrofit of RC columns than the NiTi shape
   memory alloy wire jackets since the NiTiNb shape memory alloy shows more
   appropriate temperature windows for the applications of shape memory
   alloys in civil structures.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the effect of zinc on monocyte adhesion to
   endothelial cells under different shear stress regimens, which may
   trigger atherogenesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were
   exposed to steady shear stress (15 dynes/cm(2) or 1 dyne/cm(2)) or
   reversing shear stress (time average 1 dyne/cm(2)) for 24 h. In all
   shear stress regimes, zinc deficiency enhanced THP-1 cell adhesion,
   while heparinase III reduced monocyte adhesion following reversing shear
   stress exposure. Unlike other shear stress regimes, reversing shear
   stress alone enhanced monocyte adhesion, which may be associated with
   increased H2O2 and superoxide together with relatively low levels of
   nitric oxide (NO) production. L-N-G-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME)
   treatment increased monocyte adhesion under 15 dynes/cm(2) and under
   reversing shear stress. After reversing shear stress, monocyte adhesion
   dramatically increased with heparinase III treatment followed by a zinc
   scavenger. Static culture experiments supported the reduction of
   monocyte adhesion by zinc following endothelial cell cytokine
   activation. These results suggest that endothelial cell zinc levels are
   important for the inhibition of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells,
   and may be one of the key factors in the early stages of atherogenesis.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{In special relativity, the transformation between inertial frames for an
   electromagnetic plane wave is usually derived for the time-harmonic case
   (the field is a sinusoid of infinite duration), even though all
   practical waves are of finite duration and may not even contain a
   dominant sinusoid. This paper presents an alternative derivation in
   which the time dependence of the field is general; for example, it could
   be a Gaussian pulse in time. The changes that occur on transformation in
   the quantities that describe the wave are obtained and discussed. These
   changes include the temporal behaviour, direction of propagation,
   electromagnetic field, energy, and linear momentum. The derivation uses
   only elementary principles from special relativity, so it is suitable
   for an introductory course on the subject or a course on
   electrodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{As airport surface surveillance technologies develop, aircraft ground
   position information becomes more easily available and accurate. This
   paper provides a better understanding of the value of future surface
   surveillance systems where departures, and more specifically pushback
   times, will be optimized. It analytically quantifies the potential
   benefits yielded by providing surveillance information to the agent or
   system that is entrusted with tactically optimizing pushback clearances
   under nominal conditions. A stochastic model of surface operations is
   developed for single-ramp surface operations and calibrated to emulate
   departure surface operations at LaGuardia Airport. Two levels of
   information are examined within a tactically optimized collaborative
   decision-making framework. For each level, emissions, number of taxiing
   aircraft, and runway utilization rate are analyzed and compared with a
   simple threshold policy to evaluate surface surveillance information.
   Safety benefits, however, are not considered in this paper. It is
   estimated that optimally controlling pushback clearances from a
   single-ramp area using detailed surface surveillance information does
   not provide significant benefits when compared with controlling pushback
   clearances using a gate-holding policy based on the number of aircraft
   currently taxiing. However, when the runway is functioning at
   intermediate capacity (50\%-72\% runway utilization rates), e. g., under
   adverse weather conditions, surveillance information may improve
   optimization of departure operations. In such case, emissions and the
   number of taxiing aircraft are reduced by up to 6\% when compared with
   the gate-holding policy and by up to 3\% when compared with the
   performance of an intelligent operator with limited information.}},

Abstract = {{A new night-time lane detection system and its accompanying framework

Abstract = {{This paper explores how to extract empirical knowledge from R\&D,

   characterize the technology, gauge its state of development, and depict
   the socio-technical system institutions and actors. We apply this to the
   case of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). A new cross-charting method
   appears effective at associating novel technology-enabled capabilities
   to gain functional advantages, and to link those functions to potential
   applications. The resulting systems model can help private and public

Abstract = {{Objective-Inflammation plays a central role in atherosclerosis. However,
   the detailed changes in the composition and quantity of leukocytes in
   the arterial wall during atherogenesis are not fully understood in part
   because of the lack of suitable methods and animal models.
   Methods and Results-We developed a 10-fluorochrome, 13-parameter flow
   cytometry method to quantitate 7 major leukocyte subsets in a single
   digested arterial wall sample. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice underwent
   left carotid artery (LCA) partial ligation and were fed a high-fat diet
   for 4 to 28 days. Monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes,
   natural killer cells, and CD4 T cells significantly infiltrated the LCA
   as early as 4 days. Monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells decreased
   between 7 and 14 days, whereas T-cell numbers remained steady. Leukocyte
   numbers peaked at 7 days, preceding atheroma formation at 14 days. B
   cells entered LCA by 14 days. Control right carotid and sham-ligated
   LCAs showed no significant infiltrates. Polymerase chain reaction and
   ELISA arrays showed that expression of proinflammatory cytokines and
   chemokines peaked at 7 and 14 days postligation, respectively.
   Conclusion-This is the first quantitative description of leukocyte
   number and composition over the life span of murine atherosclerosis.
   These results show that disturbed flow induces rapid and dynamic
   leukocyte accumulation in the arterial wall during the initiation and
   progression of atherosclerosis. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.

Title = {{Effects of shape and stroke parameters on the propulsion performance of
   an axisymmetric swimmer}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In nature, there exists a special group of aquatic animals which have an
   axisymmetric body and whose primary swimming mechanism is to use
   periodic body contractions to generate vortex rings in the surrounding
   fluid. Using jellyfish medusae as an example, this study develops a
   mathematical model of body kinematics of an axisymmetric swimmer and
   uses a computational approach to investigate the induced vortex wakes.
   Wake characteristics are identified for swimmers using jet propulsion
   and rowing, two mechanisms identified in previous studies of medusan
   propulsion. The parameter space of body kinematics is explored through
   four quantities: a measure of body shape, stroke amplitude, the ratio
   between body contraction duration and extension duration, and the
   pulsing frequency. The effects of these parameters on thrust, input
   power requirement and circulation production are quantified. Two
   metrics, cruising speed and energy cost of locomotion, are used to
   evaluate the propulsion performance. The study finds that a more
   prolate-shaped swimmer with larger stroke amplitudes is able to swim
   faster, but its cost of locomotion is also higher. In contrast, a more
   oblate-shaped swimmer with smaller stroke amplitudes uses less energy
   for its locomotion, but swims more slowly. Compared with symmetric
   strokes with equal durations of contraction and extension, faster bell
   contractions increase the swimming speed whereas faster bell extensions
   decrease it, but both require a larger energy input. This study shows
   that besides the well-studied correlations between medusan body shape
   and locomotion, stroke variables also affect the propulsion performance.
   It provides a framework for comparing the propulsion performance of
   axisymmetric swimmers based on their body kinematics when it is
   difficult to measure and analyze their wakes empirically. The knowledge
   from this study is also useful for the design of robotic swimmers that
   use axisymmetric body contractions for propulsion.}},

Abstract = {{We report the design of an elastin-mimetic triblock copolymer with the
   ability to guide endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, and migration
   while maintaining the elastomeric properties of the protein polymer. The
   V2 ligand sequence from matricellular protein CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61,
   CYR61) was multimerized and cloned into elastin polymer LysB10, creating
   LysB10.V2. Cell adhesion studies demonstrated that a LysB10.V2 surface
   density of at least 40 pmol/cm(2) was required to elicit cell
   attachment. Peptide blocking studies confirmed V2 specific engagement
   with integrin receptor alpha(4)beta(3) (P < 0.05) and we observed the
   formation of actin stress fiber networks and vinculin clustering,
   characteristic of focal adhesion assembly. Haptotatic migration assays
   demonstrated the ability of LysB10.V2 surfaces to stimulate migration of
   endothelial cells (P < 0.05). Significantly, we illustrated the ability
   of LysB10.V2 to support a quiescent endothelium. The CCN1 molecule
   functions to support many key biological processes necessary for tissue
   repair and thus presents a promising target for bioengineering
   applications. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential to
   harness CCN1 specific function in the design of new scaffold materials
   for applications in regenerative medicine. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Sparse discriminant methods based on independence rules, such as the
   nearest shrunken centroids classifier (Tibshirani et al., 2002) and
   features annealed independence rules (Fan \& Fan, 2008), have been
   proposed as computationally attractive tools for feature selection and
   classification with high-dimensional data. A fundamental drawback of
   these rules is that they ignore correlations among features and thus
   could produce misleading feature selection and inferior classification.
   We propose a new procedure for sparse discriminant analysis, motivated
   by the least squares formulation of linear discriminant analysis. To
   demonstrate our proposal, we study the numerical and theoretical
   properties of discriminant analysis constructed via lasso penalized
   least squares. Our theory shows that the method proposed can
   consistently identify the subset of discriminative features contributing
   to the Bayes rule and at the same time consistently estimate the Bayes
   classification direction, even when the dimension can grow faster than
   any polynomial order of the sample size. The theory allows for general
   dependence among features. Simulated and real data examples show that
   lassoed discriminant analysis compares favourably with other popular
   sparse discriminant proposals.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the
   microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (Ti) substrates on
   initial oral biofilm formation.
   Materials and methods: Nine bacterial species belonging to the normal
   oral microbiota, including: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,
   Actinomyces israelii, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens,
   Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis,
   Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus sanguinis were tested on Ti
   surfaces: pretreatment (PT {[}R-a < 0.2 mu m]), acid-etched (A {[}R-a <
   0.8 mu m]), A modified to be hydrophilic (modA),
   sand-blasted/acid-etched (SLA {[}R-a = 4 mu m]), and hydrophilic SLA
   (modSLA). Disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a
   normal culture medium (CM) or human saliva (HS). The total counts of
   bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by
   checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
   Results: Higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces
   incubated with CM compared with the samples incubated with HS. PT, SLA,
   and modSLA exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in CM, whereas
   SLA and modSLA had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in HS.
   The proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also
   influenced by the surface properties and the media used: SLA and modSLA
   increased the proportion of species like A. actinomycetemcomitans and S.
   sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of A. israelii and P.
   gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva.
   Conclusions: The initial biofilm formation and composition were affected
   by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the
   media used.}},

Abstract = {{This paper estimates the temperature distribution within a
   spin-torque-transfer RAM (STTRAM) cell due to self-heating using a
   thermal simulation based on the finite volume method. The analysis shows
   that, due to high switching current and small volume of the magnetic
   tunnel junction (MTJ), there can be significant rise in temperature in
   the MTJ as well as the silicon transistor. The impacts of the increased
   temperature on operational reliability metrics of the STTRAM cell, i.e.,
   read disturb, write failure, and sensing accuracy, are evaluated. It is
   shown that, due to the self-heating effect, the operational reliability
   of an STTRAM cell depends on the read-write history of that cell.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{Enzyme fuel cells (EFCs) offer some advantages over traditional
   precious-metal-catalyzed fuel cells, such as polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, EFCs exhibit far less power
   output than PEMFCs and have relatively short life spans before materials
   must be replaced. In this work, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS) is used to analyze the internal resistances throughout the EFC at
   a variety of operating conditions. EIS analysis is focused primarily on
   the resistances of the anode, solution/membrane, and cathode. Increased
   enzyme loading results in improved power output and reductions in
   internal resistance. Conditions are identified for which enzyme loading
   does not limit the EFC performance. EIS experiments are also reported
   for EFCs operated continuously for 2 days; power output declines sharply
   over time, while all internal resistances increase. Drying of the
   cathode and enzyme/mediator degradation are believed to have contributed
   to this behavior. Finally, experiments are performed at varying
   air-humidification temperatures. Little effect on internal resistances
   or power output is observed. However, it is anticipated that increased
   air humidification can improve longevity by delivering more water to the
   cathode. Improvements to the enzymatic cathode are needed for EFC
   development. These improvements need to focus on improving transport
   rather than increasing enzyme loading. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Atomistic simulations are employed to investigate the deformation of
   nanocrystalline copper and the associated strain accommodation
   mechanisms at 10 K as a function of grain size. Volume-averaged
   kinematic metrics based on continuum mechanics theory are formulated to
   analyze the results of molecular dynamics simulations. The metrics rely
   on both reference and current configurations, along with nearest
   neighbor lists to estimate nanoscale behavior of atomic deformation
   fields in nanocrystalline copper. Various deformation mechanisms are
   activated in the structures, and shown to depend on average grain size
   of the nanocrystalline structure. Furthermore, grain boundaries, along
   with dislocation glide, become an important source of strain
   accommodation as grain size is reduced. It is demonstrated that the
   metrics capture the contributions of various mechanisms, and provide a
   sense of the history of atomic regions undergoing both elastic and
   plastic deformation. The significance of this research is that unique
   kinematic signatures of the mechanisms are uncovered using certain
   metrics, and we are able to resolve the contributions of the deformation
   mechanisms to the overall strain of the structure using Green strain.

Title = {{Role of geometric parameters in electrical measurements of insulating
   thin films deposited on a conductive substrate}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The effects of film thickness, electrode size and substrate thickness on
   the impedance parameters of alternating frequency dielectric
   measurements of insulating thin films deposited on conductive substrates
   were studied through parametric finite-element simulations. The
   quasi-static forms of Maxwell's electromagnetic equations in a time
   harmonic mode were solved using COMSOL Multiphysics (R) for several
   types of 2D models (linear and axisymmetric). The full 2D model deals
   with a configuration in which the impedance is measured between two
   surface electrodes on top of a film deposited on a conductive substrate.
   For the simplified 2D models, the conductive substrate is ignored and
   the two electrodes are placed on the top and bottom of the film. By
   comparing the full model and the simplified models, approximations and
   generalizations are deduced. For highly insulating films, such as the
   case of insulating SiO2 films on a conducting Si substrate, even the
   simplified models predict accurate capacitance values at all
   frequencies. However, the edge effects on the capacitance are found to
   be significant when the film thickness increases and/or the top
   electrode contact size decreases. The thickness of the substrate affects
   predominantly the resistive components of the dielectric response while
   having no significant effect on the capacitive components. Changing the
   electrode contact size or the film thickness determines the specific
   values of the measured resistance or capacitance while the material time
   constant remains the same, and thus this affects the frequency
   dependence that is able to be detected. This work highlights the
   importance of keeping in mind the film thickness and electrode contact
   size for the correct interpretation of the measured dielectric
   properties of micro/nanoscale structures that are often investigated
   using nanoscale capacitance measurements.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Semi-synthetic -lactam antibiotics are synthesized enzymatically with
   the use of penicillin G acylase (PGA). Currently, PGA only exhibits weak
   diastereoselectivity with respect to the alpha amino group of
   rac-phenylglycine methyl ester (rac-PGME) when it is coupled with
   6-aminopenicillanic acid to synthesize ampicillin. Therefore, we sought
   to improve the diastereoselectivity of PGA by targeting residues for
   site-saturation based on the proximity to the substrates chiral center.
   Four variants with improved selectivity for (R)-ampicillin synthesis
   were identified, all resulting from a mutation at the 24 position.
   Phe24Ala, while not identified from our library screening, was obtained
   with site-directed mutagenesis because it has been previously shown to
   be selective for (R)-enantiomers with substituents other than an amino
   group. The diastereomeric excess (d.e.(R)) value of 37 for the wild-type
   enzyme was improved to a d.e.(R) value of 98 for our most selective
   mutant, Phe24Ala. Also, four mutations at the 146 position that resulted
   in (S)-selective PGA variants were identified. Phe24 and Phe146 are on
   opposite sides of the alpha carbon of the substrate, and we have shown
   that altering these residues results in enhanced selectivity in opposite
   directions. All variants that showed selectivity for (S)-ampicillin
   synthesis showed decreased synthetic activity for pure substrates and a
   decreased synthesis-to-hydrolysis ratio. In contrast, the mutants that
   were selective for (R)-ampicillin showed significantly decreased primary
   and secondary hydrolysis when synthesizing ampicillin from pure
   (R)-PGME, resulting in up to 4-fold decrease in the synthesis to
   hydrolysis ratio and up to 2-fold increase in the yield achieved.
   Finally, it was discovered that the selective PGA variants have racemase
   or epimerase activity, a fascinating phenomenon that has never been
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Noncovalent interactions remain poorly understood despite their
   importance to supramolecular chemistry, biochemistry, and materials
   science. They are an ideal target for theoretical study, where
   interactions of interest can be probed directly, free from competing
   secondary interactions. However, the most popular tools of computational
   chemistry are not particularly reliable for noncovalent interactions.
   Here we review recent works in wavefunction-based quantum chemistry
   techniques aimed at greater accuracy and faster computations for these
   systems. We describe recent developments in high-accuracy benchmarks, a
   variety of recent wavefunction methods with promise for noncovalent
   interactions, various approximations to speed up these methods, and
   recent advances in wavefunction-based symmetry-adapted perturbation
   theory, which provides not only interaction energies but also their
   decomposition into physically meaningful components. Together, these
   advances are currently extending robust, accurate computations of
   noncovalent interactions from systems with around one dozen heavy atoms
   up to systems with several dozens of heavy atoms. (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The dynamics of multi-mode multi-dimensional (M (3) D) hybrid systems is
   described. Such systems have modes of different dimensions, for which
   the state space is defined as a fibre bundle. The implications of the
   behavior at the mode transitions is investigated in detail, for which
   pseudo-continuity is introduced. An M (3) D system is pseudo-continuous
   if instantaneous switching via higher dimensional modes does not have
   any effect. Canonical forms and parameterizations are derived for
   pseudo-continuous M (3) D systems. The system may be actively controlled
   (exo-M (3) D), or passively switched via a fixed switching surface
   (auto-M (3) D). M (3) D systems are of interest in the approximate and
   reduced order modeling for nonlinear systems and the remote control over
   one-way communication channels. The optimal timing (switching) control
   for such M (3) D systems is solved in the general case. Necessary
   conditions for a stationary solution are derived and shown to extend
   those of the equal dimension case (Egerstedt et al. 2003). We also give
   a specific solution for the linear quadratic problem, involving a
   generalization of the Riccati equation. This problem is of interest in
   deriving neighboring extremal solutions for the control under small
   perturbations of s nominal solution. Some suggestions towards
   determining the optimal mode sequence are given. We illustrate the
   problem with the optimal control for a spring assisted high jump (aka
   man on a trampoline).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of going from high-level

   sources, we show how hybrid control techniques provide the tools needed
   to compile high-level control programs in such a way that the

   introducing new control modes into nominal strings of control modes as

Abstract = {{In June 2006, the Radiation Studies Branch of the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention held a workshop to explore rapid methods of
   facilitating radiological triage of large numbers of potentially
   contaminated individuals following detonation of a radiological
   dispersal device. Two options were discussed. The first was the use of
   traditional gamma cameras in nuclear medicine departments operated as
   makeshift whole-body counters. Guidance on this approach is currently
   available from the CDC. This approach would be feasible if a manageable
   number of individuals were involved, transportation to the relevant
   hospitals was quickly provided, and the medical staff at each facility
   had been previously trained in this non-traditional use of their
   radiopharmaceutical imaging devices. If, however, substantially larger
   numbers of individuals (100's to 1,000's) needed radiological screening,
   other options must be given to first responders, first receivers, and
   health physicists providing medical management. In this study, the
   second option of the workshop was investigated-the use of commercially
   available portable survey meters (either NaI or GM based) for assessing
   potential ranges of effective dose (<50, 50-250, 250-500, and >500 mSv).
   Two hybrid computational phantoms were used to model an adult male and
   an adult female subject internally contaminated with Am-241, Cs-60,
   Cs-137, I-131, or Ir-192 following an acute inhalation or ingestion
   intake. As a function of time following the exposure, the net count
   rates corresponding to committed effective doses of 50, 250, and 500 mSv
   were estimated via Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation for each
   of four different detector types, positions, and screening distances.
   Measured net count rates can be compared to these values, and an
   assignment of one of four possible effective dose ranges could be made.
   The method implicitly assumes that all external contamination has been
   removed prior to screening and that the measurements be conducted in a
   low background, and possibly mobile, facility positioned at the triage
   location. Net count rate data are provided in both tabular and graphical
   format within a series of eight handbooks available at the CDC website

Abstract = {{Precision-guided munitions are of interest to the Army as a means of
   both reducing collateral damage and increasing the chance of desired
   effect with the first round fired. Many technical barriers must be
   overcome to effectively guide a gun-launched projectile. Gun tubes are
   rifled to impart the appropriate spin to gyroscopically stabilize a
   statically unstable projectile. Extremely high spin rates complicate the
   guidance problem for precision-guided munitions. Manoeuvres achieved
   through some control mechanism must be actuated at the projectile spin
   rate. Few control mechanisms have been developed for spin-stabilized
   projectiles. A novel manoeuvre concept is introduced in this effort. The
   effectiveness of this concept was investigated through a fundamental
   derivation of flight mechanics and aerodynamic modelling. This
   derivation and simulation implementation was verified with existing six
   degree-of-freedom methods. The manoeuvrability of the airframe and power
   requirements was assessed by the development of a flight control law.
   Results suggest sufficient manoeuvrability since the control authority
   is larger than the ballistic dispersion. The guided airframe exhibited
   no dynamic flight instabilities. Estimates of the power requirements
   were within current battery technology and size constraints.}},

Title = {{An efficient hybrid stochastic/deterministic coarse mesh neutron

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A new incident flux response expansion method has been developed to
   significantly improve the accuracy of the hybrid
   stochastic/deterministic coarse mesh transport (COMET) method.
   Additionally, two acceleration techniques are introduced that
   significantly increase the computational efficiency of the method by
   several folds. The new expansion method removes singularities associated
   with the current method that degrade its accuracy and efficiency and
   ability to solve realistic problems with complexity and size that are
   inherent in operating commercial reactors. It also enables (paves the
   way for) the response method to be imbedded in low order transport
   methods (e.g., diffusion theory) for improving accuracy without
   degradation in efficiency. In general, the new expansion method also
   enables efficient and accurate coupling of different deterministic
   methods (e.g., characteristic to discrete ordinates and in general high
   order transport to high or low order transport). The new method
   improvements enable COMET to perform whole-core neutronics analysis in
   all light and heavy water operating reactors with Monte Carlo fidelity
   and efficiency that is several orders of magnitude faster than both
   direct Monte Carlo and fine mesh transport methods.
   A stylized CANDU-6 core benchmark problem with and without adjuster rods
   was used to test the accuracy and efficiency of the COMET method in
   whole (full) core configurations at two coolant states. The benchmark
   problem consisted of 4560 fuel bundles containing a total of 168,720
   fuel pins and 21 adjuster rods. The COMET solutions were compared to
   direct Monte Carlo (MCNP) reference solutions. It was found that the
   core eigenvalue, bundle averaged and fuel pin power distributions
   predicated by COMET agree very well with the MCNP reference solution in
   all cases when the coarse mesh incident angular flux expansion in the
   two spatial and two angular (azimuthal and polar) variables is truncated
   at 4, 4, 2 and 2, respectively. These comparisons indicate that COMET
   can achieve accuracy comparable to that of the Monte Carlo method with a
   computational efficiency that is several orders of magnitude better. (C)

Abstract = {{In the theory of compressed sensing, restricted isometry analysis has
   become a standard tool for studying how efficiently a measurement matrix
   acquires information about sparse and compressible signals. Many
   recovery algorithms are known to succeed when the restricted isometry
   constants of the sampling matrix are small. Many potential applications
   of compressed sensing involve a data-acquisition process that proceeds
   by convolution with a random pulse followed by (nonrandom) subsampling.
   At present, the theoretical analysis of this measurement technique is
   lacking. This paper demonstrates that the sth-order restricted isometry
   constant is small when the number m of samples satisfies m greater than
   or similar to (s log n)(3/2), where n is the length of the pulse. This
   bound improves on previous estimates, which exhibit quadratic scaling.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1139-1150}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the response of a swirling premixed flame with
   constant burning velocity to non-axisymmetric harmonic excitation. This
   work extends prior studies of axisymmetric forcing, which have shown
   that wrinkles are excited on the flame that propagate downstream along
   the mean flame surface at a speed given by U(o)cos psi, where U-o is the
   mean flow velocity and psi is the flame angle. The swirl component in
   the flow field introduces an azimuthal transport mechanism for
   disturbances on the flame. As such, the flame response at any given
   position is a superposition of flame wrinkles excited at earlier times,
   upstream axial locations, and different azimuthal positions. These swirl
   transport effects do not arise in problems where axisymmetric flames are
   subjected to axisymmetric excitation, but enter quite prominently in the
   presence of non-axisymmetries, such as when the flame is subjected to
   transverse excitation. The solution characteristics are strongly
   dependent upon the ratio of angular rotation rate to excitation
   frequency, denoted by sigma = Omega/omega, which describes the fraction
   of azimuthal rotation a disturbance makes in one acoustic period. When
   sigma << 1 and sigma >> 1, the axial wavelength of flame wrinkles scales
   with the convective wavelength, lambda(o) but becomes much longer for
   sigma similar to O(1). The spatial variation in phase of flame wrinkling
   is also strongly dependent upon sigma. Regardless of swirl number, flame
   wrinkles propagate in helical spirals along the solution characteristics
   at a phase speed equal to the local tangential velocity. The axial phase
   characteristics of flame wrinkling at a fixed azimuthal location, as
   would be measured by laser sheet imaging, are much more complex. For
   sigma < 1, the wrinkles exhibit the familiar negative roll-off character
   for the phase with axial downstream distance, indicative of an axially
   convecting disturbance. The slope of this phase roll-off decreases with
   increasing sigma, however, and becomes zero at sigma = 1 for a compact
   flame. For sigma > 1, the wrinkles actually have a positive roll-off
   character for the phase with axial downstream distance, indicating a
   flame wrinkle with a negative trace velocity, but whose actual
   propagation velocity is positive. Finally, these results show that while
   the flame response to transverse acoustic excitation is quite strong
   locally, its spatially integrated effect is much smaller for
   acoustically compact flames. This suggests that the dominant mechanism
   through which the flame responds globally to transverse excitation is
   the induced vortical and longitudinal acoustic fluctuations. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Efficient and accurate clock synchronization is a challenge for wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs). Unlike previous works on clock synchronization
   in WSNs that consider communication delay as the main cause of clock
   inaccuracy, we propose a new adaptive synchronization scheme, AdaSynch,
   which considers the principium of the clock. We aim to overcome the
   challenges posed by WSNs' resource constraints such as limited energy
   and bandwidth, low precision oscillators and random factors. By
   implementing some experiments on TelosB platform, we find that the clock
   system switches between multiple clock models. Motivated by experiment
   results, we establish a general clock model which describes the clock
   offset in terms of the oscillators. We then design two kinds of basic
   Kalman filter models to achieve clock synchronization. In order to
   execute Kalman filtering, we propose a recursion method based on the
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to access the parameters of the
   Kalman filter model adaptively. To describe alternation in the clock
   model, we propose a Multimodel Kalman filter, and put forward an
   adaptive method based on hypothesis testing to describe these
   complexities in the clock model. We demonstrate the performance gains of
   our scheme through experiments using different Kalman filter models
   based on experiment data.}},

Abstract = {{The precipitous decline in the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of
   cellulose with conversion is one of the major limitations to the
   commercialization of second-generation biofuel. In this work, various
   rate-limiting factors (fractal kinetics, changes in crystallinity,
   accessibility, reactivity and hydrolysable fraction, enzyme clogging,
   and degree of polymerization) were investigated employing experimental
   as well as computational studies. Model-guided experiments showed
   cellulose accessibility and the hydrolysable fraction of accessible
   substrate (a previously undefined and unreported quantity) to decrease
   steadily until a conversion level of nearly 70\%, while cellulose
   reactivity, defined in terms of hydrolytic activity per amount of
   actively adsorbed cellulase, remained constant. Substrate depletion,
   accessibility and hydrolysability decrease accounted for approximately
   90\% of rate retardation up to 70\% conversion. Faster restart rates
   were observed on partially converted cellulose as compared to
   uninterrupted hydrolysis rates, supporting an enzyme clogging phenomenon
   that could possibly be responsible for the additional rate decrease. (C)

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{18-50}},

Abstract = {{We analyze reinforcement learning under so-called ``dynamic
   reinforcement.{''} In reinforcement learning, each agent repeatedly
   interacts with an unknown environment (i.e., other agents), receives a
   reward, and updates the probabilities of its next action based on its
   own previous actions and received rewards. Unlike standard reinforcement
   learning, dynamic reinforcement uses a combination of long-term rewards
   and recent rewards to construct myopically forward looking action
   selection probabilities. We analyze the long-term stability of the
   learning dynamics for general games with pure strategy Nash equilibria
   and specialize the results for coordination games and distributed
   network formation. In this class of problems, more than one stable
   equilibrium (i.e., coordination configuration) may exist. We demonstrate
   equilibrium selection under dynamic reinforcement. In particular, we
   show how a single agent is able to destabilize an equilibrium in favor
   of another by appropriately adjusting its dynamic reinforcement
   parameters. We contrast the conclusions with prior game theoretic
   results according to which the risk-dominant equilibrium is the only
   robust equilibrium when agents' decisions are subject to small
   randomized perturbations. The analysis throughout is based on the ODE
   method for stochastic approximations, where a special form of
   perturbation in the learning dynamics allows for analyzing its behavior
   at the boundary points of the state space.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{To achieve a high penetration level of intermittent renewable energy,
   the operation and control of power systems need to account for the
   associated high variability and uncertainty. Power system stability and
   security need to be ensured dynamically as the system operating
   condition continuously changes. A wide-area measurement based dynamic
   stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF) control algorithm using the
   adaptive critic designs (ACDs) is presented in this paper. The proposed
   DSOPF control replaces the traditional AGC and secondary voltage
   control, and provides a coordinated AC power flow control solution to
   the smart grid operation in an environment with high short-term
   uncertainty and variability. The ACD technique, specifically the dual
   heuristic dynamic programming (DHP), is used to provide nonlinear
   optimal control, where the control objective is explicitly formulated to
   incorporate power system economy, stability and security considerations.
   The proposed DSOPF controller dynamically drives the power system to its
   optimal operating point by continuously adjusting the steady-state set
   points sent by the traditional OPF algorithm. A 12-bus test power system
   is used to demonstrate the development and effectiveness of the proposed
   DSOPF controller.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid increase in electric power demand, introduction of RPS mandates,
   and a push towards electrification in the transportation sector is
   expected to increase power system stresses and disturbances. To tackle
   these power system issues and maintain high system reliability, it is
   essential to have information about the condition of assets present on
   the grid. Presently, due to the absence of low cost flexible grid wide
   monitoring solutions, complete information of the system is not
   achievable. This paper deals with the development of a new class of
   sensors called the smart ``stick-on{''} sensors. These are low cost,
   self-powered, universal sensors that provide a flexible monitoring
   solution for grid assets. These sensors can be mass deployed due to low
   cost, need low maintenance as they are self-powered, and can be used for
   monitoring a variety of grid assets. This paper also presents the
   details on the network architecture, interoperability and integration,
   and different design aspects of the stick-on sensor, such as novel
   energy harvesting techniques, power management, wide operating range,
   and reliability. It is envisioned that the smart stick-on sensors shall
   be an enabling technology for monitoring a variety of grid assets and
   prove to be an essential element of the Smart Grid.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Microneedle patches (MN) provide a novel method of vaccine delivery to
   the skin with the objective of targeting the large network of resident
   antigen-presenting cells to induce an efficient immune response. Our
   previous reports demonstrated that cutaneous delivery of inactivated
   influenza virus-coated MN to mice protects against lethal infection.
   Protection is correlated with sustained levels of anti-influenza virus
   serum antibodies, hemagglutination inhibition titers, and robust
   cellular responses that are often stronger than those generated by
   intramuscular vaccination. Here we dissect the early events occurring in
   murine skin after microneedle delivery of inactivated influenza virus.
   We demonstrate correlation of immunization against influenza virus with
   a local increase of cytokines important for recruitment of neutrophils,
   monocytes and dendritic cells at the site of immunization. We also
   observed prolonged antigen deposition, and migration of matured
   dendritic cells bearing influenza virus antigen from the skin.
   IMPORTANCE The immunological mechanisms by which MN vaccination confers
   protective immunity are not well understood. The present study provides
   a first analysis of the early immune events after microneedle-based
   vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{Our living environment has an abundance of energies in the forms of
   light, thermal, mechanical (such as vibration, sonic wave, wind, and
   hydraulic), magnetic, chemical, and biological. Harvesting these types
   of energies is of critical importance for long-term energy needs and
   sustainable development of the world. Over the years, rationally
   designed materials and technologies have been developed for converting
   solar and mechanical energies into electricity. Photovoltaic relies on
   approaches such as inorganic pn junctions, organic thin films, and
   organic-inorganic heterojunctions. Mechanical energy generators have
   been designed based on principles of electromagnetic induction and
   piezoelectric effect. Innovative approaches have to be developed for
   conjunctional harvesting of multiple types of energies using an
   integrated structure/material so that the energy resources can be
   effectively and complimentarily utilized whenever and wherever one or

Pages = {{328-334}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a
   negative effect either in scientific research or technological
   applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we
   demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the
   charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric
   power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG)
   is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having
   distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films
   deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once
   subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films,
   owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but
   opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential
   layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge
   ``pump{''} for driving the flow of electrons in the external toad if
   there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible
   polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3 V at a power density of
   similar to 10.4 mW/cm(3). TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy
   from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration
   and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal
   electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even
   large-scale power. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm), a well-studied, biologically
   inert polymer that undergoes a sharp aqueous thermal transition at 32
   degrees C, has been a subject of widespread interest for possible
   biological applications. A major hindrance to its successful application
   is due to the difficulty of maintaining a sharp transition when the
   polymer is modified for a physiological transition temperature,
   especially in isotonic solutions. Current copolymer blends raise the
   transition temperature but also make the transition significantly
   broader. We have combined the use of reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization with tacticity control to
   synthesize well-defined pNIPAAm that demonstrates sharp transitions
   under physiological conditions. By selecting a RAFT agent with
   appropriate end groups, controlling molecular weight, and increasing the
   racemo diad content, we were able to increase the thermal transition
   temperature of pure pNIPAAm to a sharp transition at 37.6 degrees C
   under isotonic conditions. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci

Abstract = {{Thermal systems often involve multiple spatial and temporal scales,
   where transport information from one scale is relevant at others.
   Optimized thermal design of such systems and their control require
   approaches for their rapid simulation. These activities are of
   increasing significance due to the need for energy efficiency in the
   operation of these systems. Traditional full-field simulation
   methodologies are typically unable to resolve these scales in a
   computationally efficient manner. We summarize recent work on
   simulations of conjugate transport processes over multiple length scales
   via reduced order modeling through approaches such as compact finite
   elements and proper orthogonal decomposition. In order to incorporate
   the influence of length scales beyond those explicitly considered,
   lumped models are invoked, with appropriate handshaking between the two
   frameworks. We illustrate the methodology through selected examples,
   with a focus on information technology systems. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{In this paper, we combine modeling constructs from systems modeling
   language (SysML) and Modelica to improve the support for model-based
   systems engineering (MBSE). The Object Management Group has recently
   developed the systems modeling language (OMG SysML (TM)). This visual
   modeling language provides a comprehensive set of diagrams and
   constructs for modeling many common aspects of systems engineering
   problems, such as system requirements, structures, functions, and
   behaviors. Complementing these SysML constructs, the MODELICA language
   has emerged as a standard for modeling the continuous dynamics of
   systems in terms of hybrid discrete-event and differential algebraic
   equation systems. In this paper, the synergy between SysML and Modelica
   is explored at three different levels: the definition of continuous
   dynamics models in SysML, the use of triple graph grammar based
   transformations to map between these SysML constructs and the
   corresponding Modelica models, and the integration of simulation
   experiments with other SysML constructs to support MBSE. Throughout the
   paper, an example of a car suspension is used to demonstrate these
   contributions. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005452]}},

Abstract = {{Optimization methods are presented to design Halbach arrays to maximize
   the forces applied on magnetic nanoparticles at deep tissue locations.
   In magnetic drug targeting, where magnets are used to focus therapeutic
   nanoparticles to disease locations, the sharp fall off of magnetic
   fields and forces with distances from magnets has limited the depth of
   targeting. Creating stronger forces at a depth by optimally designed
   Halbach arrays would allow treatment of a wider class of patients, e.g.
   patients with deeper tumors. The presented optimization methods are
   based on semi-definite quadratic programming, yield provably globally
   optimal Halbach designs in 2 and 3-dimensions, for maximal pull or push
   magnetic forces (stronger pull forces can collect nanoparticles against
   blood forces in deeper vessels; push forces can be used to inject
   particles into precise locations, e.g. into the inner ear). These
   Halbach designs, here tested in simulations of Maxwell's equations,
   significantly outperform benchmark magnets of the same size and
   strength. For example, a 3-dimensional 36 element 2000 cm(3) volume
   optimal Halbach design yields a 5 x greater force at a 10 cm depth
   compared to a uniformly magnetized magnet of the same size and strength.
   The designed arrays should be feasible to construct, as they have a
   similar strength (<= 1 T), size (<= 2000 cm(3)), and number of elements
   (<= 36) as previously demonstrated arrays, and retain good performance
   for reasonable manufacturing errors (element magnetization direction
   errors <= 5 degrees), thus yielding practical designs to improve
   magnetic drug targeting treatment depths. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Dry deposition velocities (V-d) for peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN)
   calculated using two community dry deposition models with different
   treatments of both stomatal and nonstomatal uptakes were evaluated using
   measurements of PAN eddy covariance fluxes over a Loblolly pine forest
   in July 2003. The observed daytime maximum of V-d(PAN) was similar to
   1.0 cm s(-1) on average, while the estimates by the WRF-Chem dry
   deposition module (WDDM) and the Noah land surface model coupled with a
   photosynthesis-based Gas Exchange Model (Noah-GEM) were only 0.2 cm
   s(-1) and 0.6 cm s(-1), respectively. The observations also showed
   considerable PAN deposition at night with typical V-d values of 0.2-0.6
   cm s(-1), while the estimated values from both models were less than 0.1
   cm s(-1). Noah-GEM modeled more realistic stomatal resistance (R-s) than
   WDDM, as compared with observations of water vapor exchange fluxes. The
   poor performance of WDDM for stomatal uptake is mainly due to its lack
   of dependence on leaf area index. Thermal decomposition was found to be
   relatively unimportant for measured PAN fluxes as shown by the lack of a
   relationship between measured total surface conductance and temperature.
   Thus, a large part of the underprediction in V-d from both models should
   be caused by the underestimation of nonstomatal uptake, in particular,
   the cuticle uptake. Sensitivity tests on both stomatal and nonstomatal
   resistances terms were conducted and some recommendations were provided.}},

Abstract = {{Peptides and polypeptides have important pharmacological properties but
   only a limited number have been exploited as therapeutics because of
   problems related to their delivery. Most of these drugs require a
   parenteral delivery system which introduces the problems of pain,
   possible infection, and expertise required to carry out an injection.
   The aim of this study was to develop a transdermal patch containing
   microneedles (MNs) coated with a peptide drug, salmon calcitonin (sCT),
   as an alternative to traditional subcutaneous and nasal delivery routes.
   Quantitative analysis of sCT after coating and drying onto microneedles
   was performed with a validated HPLC method. In vivo studies were carried
   out on hairless rats and serum levels of sCT were determined by ELISA.
   The AUC value of MNs coated with a trehalose-containing formulation (250
   +/- 83 ng/mL min) was not significantly different as compared to
   subcutaneous injections (403 +/- 53 ng/mL min), but approximately 13
   times higher than nasal administration (18.4 +/- 14.5 ng/mL min). T-max
   (5 +/- 5 min) values for MN mediated administration were 50\% shorter
   than subcutaneous injections (15 min), possibly due to rapid sCT
   dissolution and absorption by dermal capillaries. These results suggest
   that with further optimization of coating formulations, microneedles may
   enable administration of sCT and other peptides without the need for
   hypodermic injections. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An algorithm for treating flat areas and depressions in digital
   elevation models using linear interpolation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Digital elevation model (DEM) data are essential to hydrological
   applications and have been widely used to calculate a variety of useful
   topographic characteristics, e. g., slope, flow direction, flow
   accumulation area, stream channel network, topographic index, and
   others. Except for slope, none of the other topographic characteristics
   can be calculated until the flow direction at each pixel within a DEM is
   determined. However, flow direction cannot be accurately calculated
   until depressions and flat areas within a DEM have been rectified. This
   is a routine problem in hydrologic modeling, because virtually all DEMs
   contain flat and sink pixels, both real and artifactual, that if left
   untreated will prevent accurate simulation of hydrologic flow paths.
   Although a number of algorithms are available for rectifying flat and
   sink pixels in DEM data, treatment of flat areas and depressions and
   calculation of flow direction remain problematic for reasons of
   complexity and uncertainty. A new algorithm that effectively rectifies
   flat and sink pixels was developed and tested. The approach is to use
   linear interpolation between low elevation grid cells on the edge of
   each flat area or depression defined as outlets and higher elevation
   grid cells on the opposite side defined as inflow pixels. The
   implementation requires an iterative solution to accommodate the
   irregular geometry of flat areas or depressions and exceptions that
   arise. Linear interpolation across flat areas or depressions provides a
   natural way to scale elevation adjustments based on the vertical scale
   of the surrounding topography, thereby avoiding the addition or
   subtraction of arbitrary small numbers that we regard as a disadvantage
   in some prior techniques. Tests for two virtual terrains and one real
   terrain show that our algorithm effectively rectifies flat areas and
   depressions, even in low-relief terrain, and produces realistic patterns
   of flow accumulation and extracted channel networks.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the structural, morphological, and optical qualities of
   thick InxGa1-xN heteroepitaxial layers grown by metalorganic chemical
   vapor deposition with various growth conditions for applications in
   wide-bandgap solar cells. The indium incorporation depending on the
   growth temperature and indium precursor flow rate and the crystalline
   and optical qualities of InGaN layers depending on indium mole fraction
   were investigated. The InGaN layers with high structural and optical
   qualities were obtained for indium mole fractions, x(In) < 0.18, whereas
   significant degradation of material qualities was observed for x(In) >
   0.18, which is associated with the change of growth mode induced by
   reduced growth temperature. Stokes shift and microscopic and macroscopic
   phase separations were also studied. Two types of additional phases
   besides InGaN matrix, i.e., indium-rich InGaN microstructures and
   macroscopic InGaN domains, were demonstrated to be suppressed by
   controlling surface adatom mobility and growth rates. (c) 2012 Society

Abstract = {{The time-resolved fluorescence and photoelectrochemical properties of
   dye-sensitized solar cells using crystalline titania electrodes coated
   with N3 dye-dispersing amorphous titania gel were investigated to
   clarify the influence of the dye titania interaction and electron
   transfer on their photoelectric conversion performance. The photocurrent
   quantum efficiency of the electrodes was remarkably increased by a steam
   treatment due to the crystallization and densification of the amorphous
   titania layer compared to that of the untreated electrode. The electron
   injection from the dye to the crystalline titania foundation via the
   steam-treated titania dispersing the dye was confirmed to be more
   efficient than that in the conventional electrodes. The dye-dispersing
   titania layer prevented interaction between the dye molecules and back
   electron transfer from the titania to the electrolyte. The charge
   separation and photoelectric conversion performance of the
   dye-sensitized solar cells were improved by forming the specific
   dye-dispersing titania layer.}},

Abstract = {{As electrical energy storage and delivery devices, carbon-based
   electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) have attracted much attention
   for advancing the energy-efficient economy. Conventional methods for
   activated carbon (AC) synthesis offer limited control of their surface
   area and porosity, which results in a typical specific capacitance of
   70120 F g-1 in commercial EDLCs based on organic electrolytes and ionic
   liquids (ILs). Additionally, typical ACs produced from natural
   precursors suffer from the significant variation of their properties,
   which is detrimental for EDLC use in automotive applications. A novel
   method for AC synthesis for EDLCs is proposed. This method is based on
   direct activation of synthetic polymers. The proposed procedure allowed
   us to produce ACs with ultrahigh specific surface area of up to 3432 m2
   g-1 and volume of 0.54 nm pores up to 2.39 cm3 g-1. The application of
   the produced carbons in EDLCs based on IL electrolyte showed specific
   capacitance approaching 300 F g-1, which is unprecedented for carbon
   materials, and 58\% performance improvement after 10 000 chargedischarge
   cycles at the very high current density of 10 A g-1. The remarkable
   characteristics of the produced materials and the capability of the
   fabricated EDLCs to operate safely in a wide electrochemical window at
   elevated temperatures, suggest that the proposed synthesis route offers
   excellent potential for large-scale material production for EDLC use in
   electric vehicles and industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of the body-centered cubic gamma phase of uranium (U) are
   calculated using atomistic simulations. First, a modified embedded-atom
   method interatomic potential is developed for the high temperature
   body-centered cubic (gamma) phase of U. This phase is stable only at
   high temperatures and is thus relatively inaccessible to first
   principles calculations and room temperature experiments. Using this
   potential, equilibrium volume and elastic constants are calculated at 0
   K and found to be in close agreement with previous first principles
   calculations. Further, the melting point, heat capacity, enthalpy of
   fusion, thermal expansion and volume change upon melting are calculated
   and found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment. The low
   temperature mechanical instability of gamma U is correctly predicted and
   investigated as a function of pressure. The mechanical instability is
   suppressed at pressures greater than 17.2 GPa. The vacancy formation
   energy is analyzed as a function of pressure and shows a linear trend,
   allowing for the calculation of the extrapolated zero pressure vacancy
   formation energy. Finally, the self-defect formation energy is analyzed
   as a function of temperature. This is the first atomistic calculation of
   gamma U properties above 0 K with interatomic potentials.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new mass spectrometry (MS) based approach for
   continuous, spatially resolved in vitro biochemical detection and
   demonstrated its utility in a 3-D cell culture system. Extraceflular
   liquid is passively extracted at a low flow rate (similar to 10 nL/s)
   through a small bore silica capillary (ID 50 mu m); inline microdialysis
   (MD) removes ions that would interfere with mass spectrometric analysis,
   and the sample is ionized by nanoelectrospray ionization (nano-ESI) and
   mass analyzed in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The system
   successfully detects low-volume, low-concentration releases of a small
   protein (8 mu L of 5 mu M cytochrome-c, molecular mass similar to 12
   kDa) and exhibits similar to 1 min temporal resolution. The system also
   displays sensitivity to probe proximity to the sample release point. Due
   to the sensitivity of ESI-MS and its ability to simultaneously detect.
   and identify multiple unanticipated biochemicals, this approach shows
   considerable potential as a biomarker discovery tool.}},

   feed pressure (similar to 1.5 psia CO2) was approximately 4, 55, and 298

   {[}Im(21)OH]{[}Tf2N]-DBU into polymer powders substantially improved
   sorption kinetics compared to the neat counterpart. The sorption half

   demonstrates a new experimental approach to characterize CO2 sorption in
   an equimolar mixture of ionic liquids and superbase. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In previous published research, network formation has been used to
   understand morphology and properties in polymer nanocomposites
   containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through measurements of rheological
   and electrical percolation thresholds, largely in thermoplastic
   matrices. In this research, these tools are explored as a means to
   understand network transport mechanisms and changes in CNT dispersion
   during curing in a thermosetting matrix. Specifically, rheological and
   electrical measurements were performed on the uncured nanocomposites,
   and electrical measurements were performed on the cured nanocomposites.
   The resulting data were applied to a percolation model. The results
   showed that the uncured resin played a limited role in mediating
   rheological transport and that little CNT aggregation occurred during
   curing. The results of this initial work suggest that such a combination
   of techniques is applicable to understanding dispersion changes
   resulting from curing and provides complementary insight to that
   provided by electron microscopy imaging of the same phenomenon. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Engineering the electron donor/acceptor interface provides not only
   flexibility in designing optoelectronic devices but also new
   opportunities to optimize device performance. However, significant
   challenges arise from the difficulty of examining the interface, which
   is buried in a composite film. In this paper, we probed exciton
   dissociation at a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/ZnO bulk heterojunction
   interface treated with thiol molecules and charge-transport properties
   in P3HT of the composite film using field effect transistor (FET)
   devices. The role of thiol modification of ZnO in charge transfer and
   charge transport within the bulk heterojunction interface was addressed
   through comparison of the threshold voltage and the FET mobility between
   P3HT/thiol-ZnO and P3HT/ZnO FETs. Attachment of thiol molecules onto the
   ZnO surface induced a larger photoinduced threshold voltage shift than
   that for an FET with pristine ZnO, indicating that more excitons were
   dissociated within the P3HT/ZnO composite film. The origin of this
   effect is discussed through the relationship between the increased
   interfacial area between P3HT and thiol-ZnO, inferred from surface
   morphology, and structural ordering of P3HT at the interface. The charge
   carrier transport properties of P3HT in the composite film are separated
   from charge transfer, and found to depend on the presence of thiol,
   offering information on carrier scattering/trapping at the interface.
   The integrated information of charge transfer and charge transport
   properties probed with an FET device would benefit efforts aimed at the
   optimization of solar cell devices.}},

Title = {{Polymer translocation in solid-state nanopores: Dependence of scaling
   behavior on pore dimensions and applied voltage}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{We investigate unforced and forced translocation of a Rouse polymer (in
   the absence of hydrodynamic interactions) through a silicon nitride
   nanopore by three-dimensional Langevin dynamics simulations, as a
   function of pore dimensions and applied voltage. Our nanopore model
   consists of an atomistically detailed nanopore constructed using the
   crystal structure of beta-Si3N4. We also use realistic parameters in our
   simulation models rather than traditional dimensionless quantities. When
   the polymer length is much larger than the pore length, we find the
   translocation time versus chain length scales as tau similar to N2+nu
   for the unforced case and as tau similar to N(1+2 nu)/(1+nu) for the
   forced case. Our results agree with theoretical predictions which
   indicate that memory effects and tension on the polymer chain play an
   important role during the translocation process. We also find that the
   scaling exponents are highly dependent on the applied voltage (force).
   When the length of the polymer is on the order of the length of the
   pore, we do not find a continuous scaling law, but rather scaling
   exponents that increase as the length of the polymer increases. Finally,
   we investigate the scaling behavior of translocation time versus applied
   voltage for different polymer and pore lengths. For long pores, we
   obtain the theoretical scaling law of tau similar to 1/V-alpha, where
   alpha congruent to 1 for all voltages and polymer lengths. For short
   pores, we find that alpha decreases for very large voltages and/or small
   polymer lengths, indicating that the value of alpha = 1 is not
   universal. The results of our simulations are discussed in the context
   of experimental measurements made under different conditions and with
   differing pore geometries. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel supercapacitor electrode design based on
   poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole) (PProDOP) electropolymerized onto thin
   films of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on glass substrates.
   This permits the electropolymerization of thicker PProDOP films than can
   be deposited onto flat gold-coated Kapton electrodes and a
   correspondingly greater capacitance per unit area. A pyrene
   functionalized polyfluorene, designated Sticky-PF, was designed and used
   as an effective monolayer interfacial adhesion modifier between the SWNT
   films and PProDOP via noncovalent self-assembly onto the SWNT film
   surfaces before polymer electrodeposition. The thickness of the
   electrodeposited PProDOP was found to be self-limiting at thicknesses
   characteristic of each substrate electrode. Optimized areal capacitance
   values for PProDOP on flat gold and Sticky-PP coated SWNT films were
   measured to be 8.1 mF/cm(2) and 16.4 mF/cm(2), respectively, with the
   twofold enhancement due to the thicker films possible on the SWNT
   electrode. The specific capacitance of PProDOP on gold and
   Sticky-PFISWNT film substrates were found to be similar at 141 F/g and
   122 F/g, respectively, indicating the capacitance to be due to the
   electroactive polymer. The areal capacitance values of the corresponding
   supercapacitor devices constructed with Au/Kapton substrates was 3.2
   mF/cm(2), whereas a significantly greater value of 8.8 mF/cm(2) was
   measured for the Sticky-PFISWNT film substrates. The supercapacitors
   prepared using the Au/Kapton substrates were highly stable, retaining
   80\% of their electroactivity after 32 700 nonstop charge/discharge
   cycles (100\% depth of discharge). Supercapacitors made using the
   Sticky-PFISWNT substrates showed a steady loss of capacitance to about
   57\% of the original value (to 5.0 mF/cm(2)) after 32 700
   charge/discharge cycles, which was still 38\% larger than the initial
   capacitance of the gold electrode devices.}},

Title = {{Slip boundary for fluid flow at rough solid surfaces}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{A molecular dynamics simulation of slip boundary for fluid flow past a
   solid surface incorporating roughness effect as characterized by fractal
   geometry has been conducted with a focus on the origin of slip, fluid
   structure, and slip boundary flow. The results indicate that interfacial
   slip develops provided that the wall is effectively uncorrugated.
   Compared with the atomically smooth surface, extra viscous dissipation
   is induced for shear flow past a rough surface and leading to a
   reduction in boundary slip. In particular, we find that a more irregular
   topography decreases the boundary slip even for the same statistical
   roughness height. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Solute transport in divergent radial flow with multistep pumping}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{An efficient approach is developed to analytically evaluate solute
   transport in a horizontal, divergent radial flow field with a multistep
   injection flow rate and an arbitrary input concentration history. By
   assuming a piecewise steady state flow and transforming the time domain
   to the cumulative injected flow domain, the concentration distribution
   is found to be completely determined by the total volume of injected
   flow and independent of specific flow rates. Thus, on the cumulative
   flow domain, the transport problem with a temporally varying velocity
   field can be transformed into a steady state flow problem. Linear
   convolution can then be applied on the cumulative injected flow domain
   to evaluate the solution for an arbitrarily time-dependent input
   concentration. Solutions on the regular time domain can be conveniently
   obtained by mapping the solution on the cumulative injected flow domain
   to the time domain. Furthermore, we theoretically examine the conditions
   for the assumption of piecewise steady state flow to be valid. On the
   basis of the critical time scale of the ``pseudosteady state
   condition,'' defined as when velocity changes accomplish 99\% of their
   steady state differences, and the relative error in the mean travel time
   of plume front, we obtain conditions for neglecting the transitional
   period between two pumping steps. Such conditions include the following:
   (1) the duration of a pumping step, t(p), must be longer than the
   critical time scale, t(c), i.e., t(p) >= t(c) = 25r(2)S/T, where r is
   the radial distance, S is the storage coefficient, and T is the
   transmissivity, or similarly, a maximum problem domain needs to be
   defined for a given pumping strategy. (2) the maximum well pumping rate,
   q(max), should satisfy q(max) <= pi theta T/25S, where theta is the
   effective porosity. When both conditions are satisfied, transitional
   periods may be neglected.}},

Title = {{Direct Comparisons of Illumina vs. Roche 454 Sequencing Technologies on
   the Same Microbial Community DNA Sample}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is commonly used in metagenomic studies
   of complex microbial communities but whether or not different NGS
   platforms recover the same diversity from a sample and their assembled
   sequences are of comparable quality remain unclear. We compared the two
   most frequently used platforms, the Roche 454 FLX Titanium and the
   Illumina Genome Analyzer (GA) II, on the same DNA sample obtained from a
   complex freshwater planktonic community. Despite the substantial
   differences in read length and sequencing protocols, the platforms
   provided a comparable view of the community sampled. For instance,
   derived assemblies overlapped in similar to 90\% of their total
   sequences and in situ abundances of genes and genotypes (estimated based
   on sequence coverage) correlated highly between the two platforms
   (R-2>0.9). Evaluation of base-call error, frameshift frequency, and
   contig length suggested that Illumina offered equivalent, if not better,
   assemblies than Roche 454. The results from metagenomic samples were
   further validated against DNA samples of eighteen isolate genomes, which
   showed a range of genome sizes and G+C\% content. We also provide
   quantitative estimates of the errors in gene and contig sequences
   assembled from datasets characterized by different levels of complexity
   and G+C\% content. For instance, we noted that homopolymer-associated,
   single-base errors affected similar to 1\% of the protein sequences
   recovered in Illumina contigs of 10 x coverage and 50\% G+C; this
   frequency increased to similar to 3\% when non-homopolymer errors were
   also considered. Collectively, our results should serve as a useful
   practical guide for choosing proper sampling strategies and data
   possessing protocols for future metagenomic studies.}},

Title = {{Numerical study of rotational diffusion in sheared semidilute fibre
   suspension}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{692}},
Pages = {{153-182}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Fibre-level computer simulation is carried out to study the rotational
   diffusion and structural evolution of semidilute suspensions of
   non-Brownian, rigid-rod-like fibres under shear flow in a Newtonian
   fluid. The analyses use a hybrid approach where the lattice-Boltzmann
   method is coupled with the external boundary force method. The
   probability distribution of the orbit constant, p(C-b), in the
   semidilute regime is predicted with this method. The paper emphasizes
   assessment of the characteristics of a rotary diffusion model -
   anisotropic in nature (Koch, Phys. Fluids, vol. 7, 1995, pp. 2086-2088)
   - when used in suspensions with fibres of different aspect ratios
   (ranging from r(p) = 16 to 72) and with different volume concentrations
   (ranging from c(v) = 7.58 x 10(-3) to 6.14 x 10(-2)). A measure of the
   scalar Folgar-Tucker constant, C-I, is extracted from the anisotropic
   diffusivity tensor, C. The scalar C-I is mostly O(10(-4)) in the
   semidilute regime and compares very well with the experimental
   observations of Stover (PhD thesis, School of Chemical Engineering,
   Cornell University, 1991) and Stover, Koch \& Cohen (J. Fluid Mech.,
   vol. 238, 1992, pp. 277-296). The C-I values provide substantial
   numerical evidence that the range of C-I (0.0038-0.0165) obtained by
   Folgar \& Tucker (J. Rein. Plast. Compos., vol. 3, 1984, pp. 98-119) in
   the semidilute regime is actually overly diffusive. The paper also
   branches out to incorporate anisotropic diffusion (through the use of
   the Koch model) in the second-order evolution equation for A (a
   second-order orientation tensor). The solution of the evolution equation
   with the Koch model demonstrates unphysical behaviour at low
   concentrations. The most plausible explanation for this behaviour is
   error in the closure approximation; and the use of the Koch model in a
   spherical harmonics-based method (Montgomery-Smith, Jack \& Smith,
   Compos. A: Appl. Sci. Manuf., vol. 41, 2010, pp. 827-835) to solve for
   the orientation moments corroborates this claim.}},
