Abstract = {{In this study, biomass and co-fired fly ashes are examined for use as
   supplementary cementitious materials. These ash sources are not
   addressed in the current American standard for fly ash and natural
   pozzolan use in concrete (ASTM C618-12a). The influence of these ashes
   on early-age hydration kinetics, workability, setting time, strength,
   permeability, and sulfate resistance is investigated. The findings
   demonstrate that co-fired fly ash, when conforming to current ASTM C618
   specifications, can impart similar properties to concrete as coal fly
   ash. Thus, the potential of an ash to be used as a supplementary
   cementitious material is related to the chemical and physical properties
   of the ash, and not necessarily to its source (that is, coal or
   co-firing). Current standards should consider permitting co-fired fly
   ash sources that meet existing ASTM C618 requirements and any additional
   requirements deemed necessary to ensure their satisfactory performance
   when used in concrete.}},

Abstract = {{While there is an increasing interest in using photocatalytic
   cement-based materials, a lack of an appropriate standard procedure for
   testing the photocatalytic activity and efficiency of such materials
   makes comparisons among materials and data from different sources
   challenging. Current standard test methods are not appropriate for
   assessing photocatalytic nitrogen oxide conversion by cement itious
   materials because the standards do not consider surface properties of
   cementitious materials, nor are the test conditions appropriate for
   evaluation of cementitious materials. Therefore, the main objective is
   to propose a standard procedure for assessing the photocatalytic
   activity of cement mixtures with TiO2 additives and to define a
   parameter the photocatalytic efficiency factor (PEF) that could be used
   to compare the photocatalytic activity of different TiO2 cement
   mixtures, even for extended exposure conditions. The use of PEF is
   demonstrated, and values of PEF ranging from 8.40 to 51.55 mu
   mol.h(-1).m(-2) (0.78 to 4.79 mu mol.h(-1).fr(-2)) was observed for
   mixtures with TiO2 up to 15\% replacement.}},

Abstract = {{Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging as the predominant global
   health challenge of this century. Physical inactivity is one of the
   primary risk factors for NCDs. Therefore, increasing physical activity
   levels is a public health imperative. The arrival of affordable wearable
   technologies, such as wireless pedometers, provides one strategy for
   encouraging walking. However, the effectiveness of these technologies in
   promoting sustained behavior change has not been established. Insights
   from economics suggest that incentives may be a useful strategy for
   increasing maintenance and effectiveness of behavior change
   interventions, including physical activity interventions that rely on
   wearable technologies. The aim of this trial is to test the
   effectiveness of a common wireless pedometer with or without one of two
   types of incentives (cash or donations to charity) for reaching weekly
   physical activity goals. We present here the design and baseline
   characteristics of participants of this four arm randomized controlled
   trial. 800 full-time employees (desk-bound office workers) belonging to
   15 different worksites (on average, 53 (sd:37) employees at each
   worksite) were successfully randomized to one of four study arms. If
   shown to be effective, wearable technologies in concert with financial
   incentives may provide a scalable and affordable health promotion
   strategy for governments and employers seeking to increase the physical
   activity levels of their constituents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to search for a subsurface ocean within
   Ganymede through observations and modeling of the dynamics of its
   auroral ovals. The locations of the auroral ovals oscillate due to
   Jupiter's time-varying magnetospheric field seen in the rest frame of
   Ganymede. If an electrically conductive ocean is present, the external
   time-varying magnetic field is reduced due to induction within the ocean
   and the oscillation amplitude of the ovals decreases. Hubble Space
   Telescope (HST) observations show that the locations of the ovals
   oscillate on average by 2.0 degrees 1.3 degrees. Our model calculations
   predict a significantly stronger oscillation by 5.8 degrees 1.3 degrees
   without ocean compared to 2.2 degrees 1.3 degrees if an ocean is
   present. Because the ocean and the no-ocean hypotheses cannot be
   separated by simple visual inspection of individual HST images, we apply
   a statistical analysis including a Monte Carlo test to also address the
   uncertainty caused by the patchiness of observed emissions. The
   observations require a minimum electrical conductivity of 0.09 S/m for
   an ocean assumed to be located between 150 km and 250 km depth or
   alternatively a maximum depth of the top of the ocean at 330 km. Our
   analysis implies that Ganymede's dynamo possesses an outstandingly low
   quadrupole-to-dipole moment ratio. The new technique applied here is
   suited to probe the interior of other planetary bodies by monitoring
   their auroral response to time-varying magnetic fields.}},

Title = {{Reactivation mechanism of natural fractures by hydraulic fracturing in
   naturally fractured shale reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{431-439}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing technique has been commonly used in the development
   of shale reservoir aiming to produce from complex network of fractures.
   One of the key parameters that affects the hydraulic fracture complexity
   is the natural fracture in the shale reservoir. Hydraulic fractures
   being trapped by natural fractures propagate non-planar fracture in
   three dimensions. Therefore, conventional hydraulic fracture model
   cannot include the non-planar characteristics of these fractures. In
   case a hydraulic fracture crosses a natural fracture, the dependence of
   the natural fracture reactivation on injection rate remains poorly
   understood. A non-planar propagation model for hydraulic fracturing in
   naturally fractured shale reservoirs was developed based on PKN model. A
   dynamic model was derived to calculate the stress intensity factor for a
   natural fracture being crossed by a hydraulic fracture based on the
   theory of rock fracture mechanics. Based on the experimental data from
   Longmaxi shale reservoir, the fluid pressure threshold to activate the
   natural fractures was obtained for different approaching angles. The
   effects of fluid pressure on the propagation angle of natural fracture
   were discussed. According to different initial injection rates and
   approaching angles, the time and minimum injection rate were determined
   to adjust the pump, which can improve the complexity of hydraulic
   fracture. True tri-axial hydraulic fracturing test with rapidly variable
   injection rate was conducted on the shale outcrop from Longmaxi
   formation. Experimental results proved that increasing the injection
   rate at the right time can reactivate the natural fractures, which can
   induce a network of fractures in shale reservoirs. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Strong interferences can substantially deteriorate the performance of
   autofocusing techniques in ground penetrating radar (GPR) data analysis
   for reinforced concrete (RC) bridge deck evaluation. In this paper, we
   propose a new approach based on F-K dip filtering to remove
   interferences, including direct waves and cross rebar reflections.
   Different from previously related work, the surface roughness and uneven
   cross rebar reflections resulted from GPR signals propagating through
   rough surface and inhomogeneous medium are carefully modeled as
   reflectors with small dipping angles, and hence dip relaxations are
   introduced in the F-K dip filtering to remove strong interferences. The
   mechanism of the F-K filter without dip relaxation and the correctness
   of the rebar modeling are first illustrated using simulation data. Then
   its effectiveness with adequate dip relaxation is demonstrated by both
   experimental and field data. Additionally, the performance of the F-K
   dip filter with adequate dip relaxation is also compared with that of
   the background subtraction (BS) method that is commonly used for direct
   wave removal in GPR data processing for RC bridge deck evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for simultaneous tracking of multiple ground targets by an
   unmanned aerial vehicle is presented. The algorithm is specifically
   tailored toward multirotor vehicles, and it consists of a particle
   filter to predict target motion, a reference trajectory generator, and a
   finite-horizon model predictive controller for trajectory tracking. Two
   versions of the algorithm are proposed: for a vehicle equipped with a
   gimbaled camera, and for a vehicle equipped with a fixed camera.
   Furthermore, a target rejection algorithm is included to prune targets
   that inhibit accurate tracking of the majority of the target set. The
   tracking algorithm and multirotor vehicle dynamic model are first
   described, followed by example simulations for both the gimbaled and
   fixed-camera cases. Trade studies are presented, analyzing the effects
   of controller tuning parameters and camera field of view, as well as
   performance of the target rejection algorithm. In simulation
   experiments, real-world target data are used to improve simulation
   fidelity. Overall, results show that the algorithm is effective in
   capturing a set of ground targets within the field of view
   simultaneously when using either gimbaled or fixed-camera
   configurations, but performance is somewhat degraded in the fixed-camera
   case when target dynamics occur on timescales similar to tracking
   vehicle dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The pq-relaxation for the pooling problem can be constructed by applying
   McCormick envelopes for each of the bilinear terms appearing in the
   so-called pq-formulation of the pooling problem. This relaxation can be
   strengthened by using piecewise-linear functions that over-and
   under-estimate each bilinear term. Although there is a significant
   amount of empirical evidence to show that such piecewise-linear
   relaxations, which can be written as mixed-integer linear programs
   (MILPs), yield good bounds for the pooling problem, to the best of our
   knowledge, no formal result regarding the quality of these relaxations
   is known. In this paper, we prove that the ratio of the upper bound
   obtained by solving piecewise-linear relaxations (objective function is
   maximization) to the optimal objective function value of the pooling
   problem is at most n, where n is the number of output nodes. Furthermore
   for any epsilon > 0 and for any piecewise-linear relaxation, there
   exists an instance where the ratio of the relaxation value to the
   optimal value is at least n - epsilon. This analysis naturally yields a
   polynomial-time n-approximation algorithm for the pooling problem. We
   also show that if there exists a polynomial-time approximation algorithm
   for the pooling problem with guarantee better than n(1-epsilon). for any
   epsilon > 0, then NP-complete problems have randomized polynomial-time
   algorithms. Finally, motivated by the approximation algorithm, we design
   a heuristic that involves solving an MILP-based restriction of the
   pooling problem. This heuristic is guaranteed to provide solutions
   within a factor of n. On large-scale test instances and in significantly
   lesser time, this heuristic provides solutions that are often orders of
   magnitude better than those given by commercial local and global
   optimization solvers.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this experiment, plasma sheath potential profiles are measured over
   boron nitride walls in argon plasma and the effect of secondary electron
   emission is observed. Results are compared to a kinetic model. Plasmas
   are generated with a number density of 3 x 10(12) m(-3) at a pressure of
   10(-4) TorrAr, with a 1\%-16\% fraction of energetic primary electrons.
   The sheath potential profile at the surface of each sample is measured
   with emissive probes. The electron number densities and temperatures are
   measured in the bulk plasma with a planar Langmuir probe. The plasma is
   nonMaxwellian, with isotropic and directed energetic electron
   populations from 50 to 200 eV and hot and cold Maxwellian populations
   from 3.6 to 6.4 eV and 0.3 to 1.3 eV, respectively. Plasma Debye lengths
   range from 4 to 7 mm and the ion-neutral mean free path is 0.8 m. Sheath
   thicknesses range from 20 to 50 mm, with the smaller thickness occurring
   near the critical secondary electron emission yield of the wall
   material. Measured floating potentials are within 16\% of model
   predictions. Measured sheath potential profiles agree with model
   predictions within 5 V (similar to 1 T-e), and in four out of six cases
   deviate less than the measurement uncertainty of 1 V. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{In the current study, the authors quantify the binding activity of
   particle-immobilized DNA aptamers to their nucleotide and non-nucleotide
   targets. For the purposes of this work, DNA and vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF) binding analysis was carried out for VEGF-binding
   aptamers and compared to that of an ampicillin-binding aptamer as well
   as a non-aptamer DNA probe. Binding analysis followed incubation of one
   target type, coincubation of both DNA and VEGF targets, and serial
   incubations of each target type. Moreover, recovery of aptamer binding
   activity following displacement of the DNA target from aptamer: DNA
   duplexes was also explored. Flow cytometry served as the quantitative
   tool to directly monitor binding events of both the DNA target and
   protein target to the various aptamer and non-aptamer functionalized
   particles. The current work demonstrates how processing steps such as
   annealing and binding history of particleimmobilized aptamers can affect
   subsequent binding activity. To this end, the authors demonstrate the
   ability to fully recover DNA target binding activity capabilities and to
   partially recover protein target binding activity. (C) 2015 American

   isotropy and homogeneity. Here, we used an improved biomechanical model
   driven by experimental measurements of scleral and LC collagen fiber
   organization to more accurately evaluate optic nerve head (ONH)
   biomechanics.
   METHODS. Collagen fiber organization was quantitatively mapped across
   human ONH cryosections (three normal and three glaucomatous) using
   small-angle light scattering (SALS) and fed into two-dimensional finite
   element models loaded under biaxial stress to simulate raised
   intraocular pressure. Effects of artificial variations in collagen fiber
   microstructure and stiffness on LC and scleral strains were also
   investigated.
   RESULTS. Scleral collagen fibers were circumferential and exhibited the
   highest alignment in a region not immediately adjacent to, but at a
   distance (400-500 mu m) away from, the LC. In models, such a fiber
   arrangement yielded rings of low strain (second principal and effective)
   in the scleral region immediately adjacent to the LC. Further
   sensitivity analyses showed that scleral fiber alignment was crucial in
   determining LC strain levels. Moderate scleral anisotropy (as observed
   physiologically) was more effective than isotropy or high anisotropy in
   limiting LC and scleral strain magnitude.
   CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a heterogeneous collagen fiber organization
   in the peripapillary sclera appears effective in limiting LC strain and
   is able to reduce strain levels at the scleral canal boundary: a
   transition zone prone to LC disinsertion, focal lamina cribrosa defects,
   and optic disc hemorrhages in glaucoma.}},

Title = {{Controlling assembly of colloidal particles into structured objects:
   Basic strategy and a case study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A computational study is presented in which real-time manipulation cif
   the interaction potential between particles in a colloidal system is
   used to control their assembly into a close-packed crystalline object.
   The basic model used throughout the study is a high-fidelity
   representation of a real experimental system in which 32 colloidal
   silica particles are suspended in aqueous solution with polymer hydrogel
   providing a temperature-tunable attractive force between the particles.
   Diffusion mapping is used to determine a set of coarse variables that
   provide an appropriate low-dimensional representation of this system at
   four discrete values of the attraction strength. In this case the
   diffusion mapping process identified two dimensions; one correlates well
   with the radius of gyration of the entire set of particles and the other
   correlates well with the average distance between distinct clusters of
   particles. Two different stochastic models are then built in the
   two-dimensional (2D) space of these variables, using data from a large
   number of short Brownian dynamics simulations of the full 32-particle
   system. The first 2D model is based on a Smoluchowski framework and is
   used to characterize the overall equilibrium and diffusive properties of
   the system. The second 2D model is based on a transition rate matrix and
   is used for process control. A control policy based on an
   infinite-horizon Markov decision process is developed using the four
   different attraction strengths as the input variables. The resulting
   policy is non-trivial; rather than simply selecting the strongest level
   of attraction, some mix of weak and strong attractions generally
   provides the optimal approach to the target close-packed state. This
   study, while focused on the particular mechanism of tunable depletion
   attraction, suggests a general strategy that could be adapted to
   different mechanisms of actuating colloidal assembly. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Harvesting mechanical energy from our surroundings to acquire a steady
   and high power output has attracted intensive interest due to the fast

   effectively improving the utilization in space. A narrow grating of 1
   degrees was designed to produce high output. Operated at a rotation rate
   of 1,000 rpm, the TENG produces a high output power density of 267
   mW/cm(2) (total power output of 25.7 W) at a matched load of 0.93 M
   Omega. After introducing a transformer, the output power can be managed
   so that it can be directly used to charge a battery for a smart phone.
   With the PCB production technology, fabrication of high performance TENG

Abstract = {{Detecting/sensing targets underwater has very important applications in
   environmental study, civil engineering and national security. In this
   paper, an organic-film based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been
   successfully demonstrated for the first time as a self-powered and high
   sensitivity acoustic sensor to detect underwater targets at low
   frequencies around 100 Hz. This innovative, cost-effective,
   simple-design TENG consists of a thin-film-based Cu electrode and a
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film with nanostructures on its surfaces.
   On the basis of the coupling effect between triboelectrification and
   electrostatic induction, the sensor generates electrical output signals
   in response to incident sound waves. Operating at a resonance frequency
   of 110 Hz, under an acoustic pressure of 144.2 dB(SPL), the maximum
   open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the generator can
   respectively reach 65 V and 32 mu A underwater. The directional
   dependence pattern has a bi-directional shape with a total response
   angle of 60 degrees. Its sensitivity is higher than -185 dB in the
   frequency range from 30 Hz to 200 Hz. The highest sensitivity is -146 dB
   at resonance frequency. The three-dimensional coordinates of an acoustic
   source were identified by four TENGs, self-powered active sensors, and
   the location of the acoustic source was determined with an error about
   0.2 m. This study not only expands the application fields of TENGs from
   the atmosphere to water, but also shows the TENG is a promising acoustic
   source locator in underwater environments.}},

   spiking}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Homeostatic plasticity encompasses a set of mechanisms that are thought
   to stabilize firing rates in neural circuits. The most widely studied
   form of homeostatic plasticity is upward synaptic scaling (upscaling),
   characterized by a multiplicative increase in the strength of excitatory
   synaptic inputs to a neuron as a compensatory response to chronic
   reductions in firing rate. While reduced spiking is thought to trigger
   upscaling, an alternative possibility is that reduced glutamatergic
   transmission generates this plasticity directly. However, spiking and
   neurotransmission are tightly coupled, so it has been difficult to
   determine their independent roles in the scaling process. Here we
   combined chronic multielectrode recording, closed-loop optogenetic
   stimulation, and pharmacology to show that reduced glutamatergic
   transmission directly triggers cell-wide synaptic upscaling. This work
   highlights the importance of synaptic activity in initiating signalling
   cascades that mediate upscaling. Moreover, our findings challenge the
   prevailing view that upscaling functions to homeostatically stabilize
   firing rates.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically evaluated two different approaches to the syntheses of
   Pd@Pt-nL (n = 2-5) core shell octahedra. We initially prepared the core
   shell octahedra using a polyol-based route by titrating a Pt(IV)
   precursor into the growth solution containing Pd octahedral seeds at 200
   degrees C through the use of a syringe pump. The number of Pt atomic
   layers could be precisely controlled from two to five by increasing the
   volume of the precursor solution while fixing the amount of seeds. We
   then demonstrated the synthesis of Pd@Pt-nL octahedra using a
   water-based route at 95 degrees C through the one-shot injection of a
   Pt(II) precursor. Due to the large difference in reaction temperature,
   the Pd@P-nL octahedra obtained via the water-based route showed sharper
   corners than their counterparts obtained through the polyol-based route.
   When compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst based upon 3.2 nm Pt
   particles, the Pd@Pt-nL octahedra prepared using both methods showed
   similar remarkable enhancement in terms of activity (both specific and
   mass) and durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction. Calculations
   based upon periodic, self-consistent density functional theory suggested
   that the enhancement in specific activity for the Pd@Pt-nL octahedra
   could be attributed to the destabilization of OH on their
   Pt-nL{*}/Pd(111) surface relative to the \{111\} and \{100\} facets
   exposed on the surface of Pt/C. The destabilization of OH facilitates
   its hydrogenation, which was found to be the rate-limiting step of the
   oxygen reduction reaction on all these surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{A high-resolution dynamic tactile/pressure display is indispensable to
   the comprehensive perception of force/mechanical stimulations such as
   electronic skin, biomechanical imaging/analysis, or personalized
   signatures. Here, we present a dynamic pressure sensor array based on
   pressure/strain tuned photoluminescence imaging without the need for
   electricity. Each sensor is a nanopillar that consists of InGaN/GaN
   multiple quantum wells. Its photoluminescence intensity can be modulated
   dramatically and linearly by small strain (0-0.15\%) owing to the
   piezo-phototronic effect. The sensor array has a high pixel density of
   6350 dpi and exceptional small standard deviation of photoluminescence.
   High-quality tactile/pressure sensing distribution can be real-time
   recorded by parallel photoluminescence,imaging without any cross-talk.
   The sensor array can be inexpensively fabricated over large areas by
   semiconductor product lines. The proposed dynamic all-optical pressure
   imaging with excellent resolution, high sensitivity, good uniformity,
   and ultrafast response time offers a electromechanical systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) enzymes are involved in catalyzing the
   metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. A rapid
   analysis of drug metabolism reactions by CYPs is required because they
   can metabolize 95\% of current drugs in drug development and effective
   therapies. Here, we describe a study of piezotronic-effect enhanced drug
   metabolism and sensing by utilizing a single ZnO nanowire (ZnO NW)
   device. Owing to the unique hydrophobic feature of a ZnO NW that
   provides a desirable ``microenvironment{''} for the immobilization of
   biomolecules, our device can effectively stimulate the tolbutamide
   metabolism by decorating a ZnO NW with cytochrome P4502C9/CYPs reductase
   (CYP2C9/CPR) microsomes. By applying an external compressive strain to
   the ZnO nanowire, the piezotronic effect, which plays a primary role in
   tuning the transport behavior of a ZnO NW utilizing the created
   piezoelectric polarization charges at the local interface, can
   effectively enhance the performance of the device. A theoretical model
   is proposed using an energy band diagram to explain the experimental
   data. This study provides a potential approach to study drug metabolism
   and trace drug detection based on the piezotronic effect.}},

Abstract = {{With 70\% of the earth's surface covered with water, wave energy is
   abundant and has the potential to be one of the most environmentally
   benign forms of electric energy. However, owing to lack,of effective
   technology, water wave energy harvesting is almost Unexplored as an
   energy source. Here, we report a network design made of triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs) for large-scale harvesting of kinetic water
   energy. Relying on surface charging effect between the conventional
   polymers and very thin layer of metal as electrodes for each TENG, the
   TENG networks (TENG-NW) that naturally float on the water surface
   convert the slow, random, and high-force oscillatory wave energy into
   electricity. On the basis of the measured output of a single TENG, the
   TENG-NW is expected to give an average power output of 1.15 MW from 1
   km(2) surface area. Given the compelling features, such as being
   lightweight, extremely cost-effective, environmentally friendly, easily
   implemented, and capable of floating on the water surface, the TENG-NW
   renders an innovative and effective approach toward large-scale blue
   energy harvesting from the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Bone fractures and non-union defects often require surgical intervention
   where biomaterials are used to correct the defect, and approximately
   10\% of these procedures are compromised by bacterial infection.
   Currently, treatment options are limited to sustained, high doses of
   antibiotics and surgical debridement of affected tissue, leaving a
   significant, unmet need for the development of therapies to combat
   device-associated biofilm and infections. Engineering implants to
   prevent infection is a desirable material characteristic. Tissue
   engineered scaffolds for bone repair provide a means to both regenerate
   bone and serve as a base for adding antimicrobial agents. Incorporating
   anti-infection properties into regenerative medicine therapies could
   improve clinical outcomes and reduce the morbidity and mortality
   associated with biomaterial implant-associated infections. This review
   focuses on current animal models and technologies available to assess
   bone repair in the context of infection, antimicrobial agents to fight
   infection, the current state of antimicrobial scaffolds, and future
   directions in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering strategies have utilized a wide spectrum of synthetic
   and naturally-derived scaffold materials. Synthetic scaffolds are better
   defined and offer the ability to precisely and reproducibly control
   their properties, while naturally-derived scaffolds typically have
   inherent biological and structural properties that may facilitate tissue
   growth and remodeling. More recently, efforts to design optimized
   biomaterial scaffolds have blurred the line between these two
   approaches. Naturally-derived scaffolds can be engineered through the
   manipulation of intrinsic properties of the pre-existing backbone (e.g.,
   structural properties), as well as the addition of controllable
   functional components (e.g., biological properties). Chemical and
   physical processing techniques used to modify structural properties of
   synthetic scaffolds have been tailored and applied to naturally-derived
   materials. Such strategies include manipulation of mechanical
   properties, degradation, and porosity. Furthermore, biofunctional
   augmentation of natural scaffolds via incorporation of exogenous cells,
   proteins, peptides, or genes has been shown to enhance functional
   regeneration over endogenous response to the material itself. Moving
   forward, the regenerative mode of action of naturally-derived materials
   requires additional investigation. Elucidating such mechanisms will
   allow for the determination of critical design parameters to further
   enhance efficacy and capitalize on the full potential of
   naturally-derived scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important research topic in
   the last decade, where things refer to interconnected machines and
   objects with embedded computing capabilities employed to extend the
   Internet to many application domains. While research and development
   continue for general IoT devices, there are many application domains
   where very tiny, concealable, and non-intrusive Things are needed. The
   properties of recently studied nanomaterials, such as graphene, have
   inspired the concept of Internet of NanoThings (IoNT), based on the
   interconnection of nanoscale devices. Despite being an enabler for many
   applications, the artificial nature of IoNT devices can be detrimental
   where the deployment of NanoThings could result in unwanted effects on
   health or pollution. The novel paradigm of the Internet of Bio-Nano
   Things (IoBNT) is introduced in this paper by stemming from synthetic
   biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of
   biological embedded computing devices. Based on biological cells, and
   their functionalities in the biochemical domain, Bio-NanoThings promise
   to enable applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation
   networks, and environmental control of toxic agents and pollution. The
   IoBNT stands as a paradigm-shifting concept for communication and
   network engineering, where novel challenges are faced to develop
   efficient and safe techniques for the exchange of information,
   interaction, and networking within the biochemical domain, while
   enabling an interface to the electrical domain of the Internet.}},

   The use of virtual impedance for current limiting is shown to improve
   transient stability during current limiting when operating in parallel

Abstract = {{Dynamic control over real and reactive power flow is one of the key
   areas of concern for the modern grid. Traditional FACTS-based devices
   have proven to be too costly and complex to achieve any significant
   market penetration. Modifying existing transmission assets to make them
   controllable may be a cost-effective method of increasing the grid
   controllability. Controllable network transformers (CNTs) have been
   theoretically shown to be an effective real and reactive power flow
   controller. However, the CNT is shown to produce unwanted third harmonic
   voltages and currents in the system, which must be handled. In this
   paper, the use of a hybrid active filter (HAF) is proposed for this
   purpose. This paper discusses the approach for design and control of
   such an integrated CNT-HAF system. It is shown that the integrated
   CNT-HAF system can also mitigate system unbalance, apart from providing
   four-quadrant control capability. Furthermore, this paper also presents
   experimental results of an integrated CNT-HAF system, rated at 200 kVA
   and 2400 V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the powering of smart grid sensors with electric
   fields (E-fields) present in abundance near most medium-voltage to
   high-voltage (MV/HV) utility assets. A unique E-field energy harvester
   is proposed, which is integrated into a sensor's enclosure, thereby
   ensuring low-cost and compact size. The proposed energy harvester can be
   used with multiple assets by virtue of its shape, which also allows
   installation without interruption of the MV/HV asset. Design methodology
   of the harvester through Maxwell simulations along with a new and
   efficient circuit design for obtaining a regulated dc supply is
   presented. A medium-voltage prototype of the proposed E-field energy
   harvester integrated with a wireless voltage sensor is built and tested
   on a 35-kV bus. The prototype provides 17 mW of continuous power at 35
   kV with a high energy density. This power is enough to operate a
   low-duty-cycle sensor node stuck on to an MV/HV asset. The prototype
   shows promising results and demonstrates the efficacy of using E-fields
   for powering smart grid sensors for MV/HV assets.}},

Abstract = {{Most current model reference adaptive control (MRAC) methods rely on
   parametric adaptive elements, in which the number of parameters of the
   adaptive element are fixed a priori, often through expert judgment. An
   example of such an adaptive element is radial basis function networks
   (RBFNs), with RBF centers preallocated based on the expected operating
   domain. If the system operates outside of the expected operating domain,
   this adaptive element can become noneffective in capturing and canceling
   the uncertainty, thus rendering the adaptive controller only semiglobal
   in nature. This paper investigates a Gaussian process-based Bayesian
   MRAC architecture (GP-MRAC), which leverages the power and flexibility
   of GP Bayesian nonparametric models of uncertainty. The GP-MRAC does not
   require the centers to be preallocated, can inherently handle
   measurement noise, and enables MRAC to handle a broader set of
   uncertainties, including those that are defined as distributions over
   functions. We use stochastic stability arguments to show that GP-MRAC
   guarantees good closed-loop performance with no prior domain knowledge
   of the uncertainty. Online implementable GP inference methods are
   compared in numerical simulations against RBFN-MRAC with preallocated
   centers and are shown to provide better tracking and improved long-term
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique has been
   widely adopted in wireless systems, but it is known for being sensitive
   to synchronization errors. In this paper, we present timing and
   frequency synchronization algorithms for OFDM downlink transmissions
   using Zadoff-Chu sequences. We show that the current timing
   synchronization method employing Zadoff-Chu sequences is sensitive to
   carrier frequency offsets. To reduce this sensitivity, we develop
   conditions for the selection of appropriate Zadoff-Chu sequences. We
   then design a training sequence and propose joint signal detection,
   timing, and carrier frequency offset estimation algorithms for OFDM
   downlink transmissions. We show that the proposed schemes simplify the
   overall synchronization architecture and improve the performance
   compared to the existing schemes in the literature.}},

Title = {{Experimental Investigation of Air Flow Through a Perforated Tile in a
   Raised Floor Data Center}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Raised floor data centers supply cold air from a pressurized plenum to
   the server racks through perforated floor tiles. Hence, the design of an
   efficient air delivery scheme requires better understanding of the flow
   features, through and above the perforated tiles. Different tiles with
   circular pores in a staggered arrangement and with the same thickness
   are considered. Tile sheet porosities of 23\% and 40\%, air flow rates
   of 0.56 m(3)/s (1177 CFM) and 0.83 m(3)/s (1766 CFM), and pore sizes of
   3.18 mm (1/8 in.) and 6.35 mm (1/4 in.) are investigated. Tiles with
   38.1 mm (1.5 in.) region blocked along the edges is compared to the base
   case with 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) blocked edges. Width reduced to 0.46 m (1.5
   ft) from standard width of 0.61 m (2 ft) is also examined. Reduced tile
   width is used to simulate 0.91 m (3 ft) cold aisle instead of standard
   1.22 m (4 ft) cold aisle, with potential to save floor space. A case
   where the rack is recessed by 76.2 mm (3 in.) from the tile edge is also
   included in the investigation, as there is a possibility of having racks
   nonadjacent to the tile edges. Particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   technique is used to characterize the flow field emerging from a
   perforated tile and entering the adjacent rack. Experiments suggest that
   lower tile porosity significantly increases cold air bypass from the
   top, possibly due to higher air jet momentum above the tile, as compared
   to a tile with higher porosity. For the air flow rates investigated
   here, the flow field was nearly identical and influence of flow rate was
   nondistinguishable. The influence of pore size was non-negligible, even
   when the porosity and flow rate for the two cases were same. Larger
   blockage of the tile edges resulted in higher cold air bypass from the
   top. Reduction in the tile width showed improved air delivery to the
   rack with considerably reduced cold air bypass. Recessing the rack did
   not affect the flow field significantly.}},

   10(4) - 10(5) times faster than using full-field computational fluid
   dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) method, with reasonable accuracy and

Title = {{Optimization of Thermoelectric Coolers for Hotspot Cooling in
   Three-Dimensional Stacked Chips}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) chip stacking architecture is expected to reduce
   form factor, improve performance, and decrease power consumption in
   future microelectronics. High power density and nonuniform power
   distribution in stacked dies are expected to bring significant thermal
   challenges for 3D packages due to localized hot spots. Embedded
   thermoelectric coolers (TECs) have potential to provide reliable and
   localized cooling at these hot spots. In this work, peak package
   temperature or active cooling per power consumption of TECs are
   optimized, considering applied current and thickness of TECs as
   parameters, for a 3D electronic package with two stacked dies. Each die
   has two hot spots and one TEC is paired with each hot spot. Three
   different optimization methods are considered in order to ensure a
   robust solution. The optimization suggests that both the peak
   temperature in package and energy efficiency of the cooling system can
   be significantly improved through the optimization of TECs. TECs are
   also compared against a configuration where they are replaced by copper
   blocks or thermal vias. A total of 4.7 degrees C of additional localized
   cooling is observed using TECs which is beyond what is achievable with
   copper vias in place of the TECs. The study also suggests that it is
   better to use TECs to cool only the hottest portions of the package to
   avoid introducing additional thermal resistance and Joule heating in the
   package.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can significantly improve the net power
   consumption and battery life of the low power mobile devices or high
   performance devices by generating power from their waste heat. Recent
   advancements also show that the ultrathin thermoelectric devices can be
   fabricated and integrated within a micro-electronic package. This work
   investigates the power generation by an ultrathin TEG embedded within a
   micro-electronic package considering several key parameters such as load
   resistance, chip heat flux, and proximity of the TEG to chip. The
   analysis shows that the power generation from TEGs increases with
   increasing background heat flux on chip or when TEGs are moved closer to
   the chip. An array of embedded TEGs is considered in order to analyze
   the influence of multiple TEGs on total power generation and conversion
   efficiency. Increasing the number of TEGs from one to nine increases the
   useful power generation from 72.9 mW to 378.4 mW but decreases the
   average conversion efficiency from 0.47\% to 0.32\%. The average power
   generated per TEG gradually decrease from 72.9 mW to 42.0 mW when number
   of TEGs is increased from one to nine, but the total useful power
   generated using nine TEGs is significant and emphasize the benefits of
   using embedded TEGs to reduce net power consumption in electronics

Abstract = {{The data center industry has experienced significant growth over the
   last decade, mainly due to the increased use of the internet for our day
   to day activities such as e-commerce, social media, video streaming, and
   healthcare. This growth in demand results in higher energy costs, as
   data centers can be energy intensive facilities. A significant portion
   of the energy used in data centers is for cooling purposes. Hence, it is
   one of the important areas of optimization to be addressed to create
   more efficient data centers. Among the many ways to increase data center
   efficiencies, air flow management is a key solution to many existing
   data centers. Fundamentally, there are three main schemes: hot-aisle
   containment, cold-aisle containment, and exhaust chimney containment.
   This paper's focus is to experimentally characterize the following cold
   aisle configurations: open aisle, partially contained aisle, and fully
   contained aisles. Experimental data presented to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the different configurations are rack inlet contour
   plots, tile and rack flow rates, pressure measurements, and server
   central processing unit (CPU) temperatures.}},

   decelerator and a guided parafoil system to achieve sub-100 m miss
   distances. Three supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator
   configurations (tension cone, attached isotensoid, and trailing
   isotensoid) are examined using the metrics of decelerator mass,
   aerodynamic performance, and vehicle integration. In terms of
   aerodynamic performance, the tension cone is the preferred choice for
   the sizes investigated. The attached isotensoid was shown to be the most
   mass efficient decelerator, whereas the trailing isotensoid was found to
   be the more ideal decelerator for vehicle integration.
   Athree-degree-of-freedom trajectory simulation is used in conjunction
   with Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to assess the landed accuracy
   capability of the proposed architectures. In 95\% of the cases examined,
   the drag-modulated inflatable aerodynamic decelerator provides arrivals
   within the 10 km parafoil capability region, meeting the sub-100 m

Abstract = {{This analysis defines an analytic model for the pitching motion of blunt
   bodies during atmospheric entry. The proposed model is independent of
   the pitch-damping sum coefficient present in the standard formulation of
   the equations ofmotion describing pitch oscillations of a decelerating
   blunt body, instead using the principle of a time-lagged aftbody moment
   as the forcing function for oscillation divergence. It is shown that the
   dynamic oscillation responses typical to blunt bodies can be produced
   using hysteresis of the aftbody moment in place of the pitch-damping
   coefficient. Four parameters, all with intuitive physical relevance, are
   introduced to fully define the aftbody moment and the associated time
   delay. The approach used in this investigation is shown to be useful in
   understanding the governing physical mechanisms for blunt-body dynamic
   stability and in guiding vehicle and mission design requirements. A
   validation case study using simulated ballistic range test data is
   conducted. Fromthis, parameter identification is carried out through the
   use of a least-squares optimizing routine. Results show good agreement
   with the limited existing literature for the parameters identified,
   suggesting that the model proposed could be validated by a limited
   experimental ballistic range test series or with existing data. The
   trajectories produced by the identified parameters are found to match
   closely those from the Mars Exploration Rover ballistic range tests for
   a range of initial conditions.}},

   properties. Metallic CNT bundles can allow nearly unhampered transport
   of electrons, resulting in a low resistance interconnect capable of
   withstanding high current densities. The growth of CNTs with ethylene
   and methane precursors by thermal chemical vapor deposition has been
   investigated using thin films of aluminum oxide and iron as catalysts.
   Nickel and cobalt were investigated as well with limited success. CNT
   growth is followed by electrochemical deposition (ECD) of copper.
   Traditionally, sputtered or evaporated Cu is used as a seed layer for
   ECD; however, the high temperatures necessary for CNT growth made Cu an
   unsuitable seed layer due to migration. The authors investigated
   combinations of ECD seed layers and CNT catalysts on the surface of a
   silicon wafer to qualify the best materials for the formation of a
   Cu/CNT matrix. ECD of Cu was studied on as-grown and densified CNTs with
   a tungsten seed layer. Once the process for covering CNT bundles with
   copper is optimized, future work will focus on placing the materials
   system inside cylindrical vias formed using an inductively coupled
   plasma etch process. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate factors that influence airline customers' purchases of
   premium coach seats using a database of online prices and seat map
   displays collected from Jet Blue's website. Results show that multiple
   factors influence purchasing behavior; these factors include the amount
   of the seat fee, how far in advance the ticket is purchased, the number
   of passengers traveling together, and load factors (as revealed through
   seat map displays). We find that customers are between 2 and 3.3 times
   more likely to purchase premium coach seats (with extra legroom and
   early boarding privileges) when there are no regular coach window or
   aisle seats that can be reserved for free. In addition, we find that
   customers who purchase tickets closer to the departure date are less
   price-sensitive and are willing to pay higher seat fees. We use these
   model results to show that Jet Blue's seat fees are currently
   underpriced in many markets; an optimal static fee would increase
   revenues by 8\% whereas optimal time-dependent fees would increase
   revenues by 10.2\%. In addition, ifJet-Blue were to leave their seat
   fees unchanged and instead reserve certain rows of seats for premier
   customers, they could potentially increase revenues by 12.8\%. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: The use of sunlight to make chemical fuels (i.e., solar
   fuels) is an attractive approach in the quest to develop sustainable
   energy sources. Using nature as a guide, assemblies for artificial
   photosynthesis will need to perform multiple functions. They will need
   to be able to harvest light across a broad region of the solar spectrum,
   transport excited-state energy to charge-separation sites, and then
   transport and store redox equivalents for use in the catalytic reactions
   that produce chemical fuels. This multifunctional behavior will require
   the assimilation of multiple components into a single macromolecular
   system.
   A wide variety of different architectures including porphyrin arrays,
   peptides, dendrimers, and polymers have been explored, with each design
   posing unique challenges. Polymer assemblies are attractive due to their
   relative ease of production and facile synthetic modification. However,
   their disordered nature gives rise to stochastic dynamics not present in
   more ordered assemblies. The rational design of assemblies requires a
   detailed understanding of the energy and electron transfer events that
   follow light absorption, which can occur on time scales ranging from
   femtoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, necessitating the use of
   sophisticated techniques. We have used a combination absorption and
   emission spectroscopies with observation times that span 9 orders of
   magnitude to follow evolution within polymer-based molecular assemblies.
   We complement experimental observations with molecular dynamics
   simulations to develop a microscopic view of these dynamics.
   This Account provides an overview of our work on polymers decorated with
   pendant Ru(II) chromophores, both in solution and on surfaces. We have
   examined site-to-site energy transport among the Ru(II) complexes, and
   in systems incorporating, pi-conjugated polymers, we have observed
   ultrafast formation of a long-lived charge-separated state. When
   attached to TiO2, these assemblies exhibit multifunctional behavior in
   which photon absorption is followed by energy transport to the surface
   and electron injection to produce an oxidized metal complex. The
   oxidizing equivalent is then transferred to the conjugated polymer,
   giving rise to a long-lived charge-separated state.}},

Abstract = {{The critical task of anesthesia administration demands optimal drug
   titration by considering patient-specific features and sedation
   requirements. Though there exist several sedation assessment monitors,
   physicians still largely rely on subjective sedation scoring systems.
   This paper presents an optimal infusion controller for the continuous
   infusion of midazolam along with the analgesic fentanyl. Specifically,
   we extend the convex optimization-based optimal drug dosing regimen for
   propofol to midazolam. We additionally propose an alternative
   optimization approach using the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure of
   two probability distributions. It is shown that by using the new
   proposed approach one can achieve the desired sedation level by using
   less drug infusion in comparison with previous methods. A nonlinear
   two-compartment model is used to describe the pharmacokinetics of
   midazolam and a stochastic pharmacodynamic model is used that utilizes
   the modified Ramsay sedation scoring method to link the plasma drug
   concentration with the effective probabilistic sedation level.}},

Abstract = {{High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a natural nanoparticle that exhibits
   an intrinsic affinity for atherosclerotic plaque macrophages. Its
   natural targeting capability as well as the option to incorporate
   lipophilic payloads, e.g., imaging or therapeutic components, in both
   the hydrophobic core and the phospholipid corona make the HDL platform
   an attractive nanocarrier. To realize controlled release properties, we
   developed a hybrid polymer/HDL nanoparticle composed of a
   lipid/apolipoprotein coating that encapsulates a poly(lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) (PLGA) core. This novel HDL-like nanoparticle (PLGA-HDL) displayed
   natural HDL characteristics, including preferential uptake by
   macrophages and a good cholesterol efflux capacity, combined with a
   typical PLGA nanoparticle slow release profile. In vivo studies carried
   out with an ApoE knockout mouse model of atherosclerosis showed clear
   accumulation of PLGA-HDL nanoparticles in atherosclerotic plaques, which
   colocalized with plaque macrophages. This biomimetic platform integrates
   the targeting capacity of HDL biomimetic nanoparticles with the
   characteristic versatility of PLGA-based nanocarriers.}},

Abstract = {{The availability, relative consistency, and renewability of hardwood
   pulp fibers have prompted interest in their use in fiber-cement
   composites, in which they may be used for a variety of purposes. This
   study clarifies the ability of hardwood pulp to reinforce mortar, its
   capacity to provide internal curing, and its role as early-age
   crack-control reinforcement through a coordinated series of restrained
   shrinkage, free shrinkage, and mechanical testing on mortar samples. It
   finds that hardwood pulp improves the restrained shrinkage behavior of
   mortar at an early age. That is, 0.5\% and 0.75\% (by volume) hardwood
   pulp-reinforced mortars exhibited a lower rate of stress development and
   lengthened time-to-cracking by about 1.6 times and 2.3 times,
   respectively, compared to a companion crack-prone ordinary mortar. The
   initial crack width also decreased by 88\% in 0.75\% hardwood
   pulp-reinforced mortar samples, which suggested an application aimed at
   assisting self-healing in cement-based materials with an appropriate
   binder composition. Hardwood pulp successfully provided internal curing
   to crack-prone mortar and thus reduced autogenous shrinkage. This
   reduction in shrinkage, together with a combination of increased early
   tensile capacity, reduced stiffness, and improved post-cracking
   toughness were identified as the key contributions of hardwood pulp in
   the improved resistance of mortar to early-age cracking. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the potential of spin-transfer torque devices as an
   alternative to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor for non-von
   Neumann and non-Boolean computing. Recent experiments on spin-transfer
   torque devices have demonstrated high-speed magnetization switching of
   nanoscale magnets with small current densities. Coupled with other
   properties, such as nonvolatility, zero leakage current, high
   integration density, we discuss that the spin-transfer torque devices
   can be inherently suitable for some unconventional computing models for
   information processing. We review several spintronic devices in which
   magnetization can be manipulated by current induced spin transfer torque
   and explore their applications in neuromorphic computing and
   reconfigurable memory-based computing.}},

Abstract = {{A fast and efficient system-level design methodology is developed and
   validated to evaluate and optimize processors using emerging
   technologies at the early design stage. It includes an updated empirical
   cycle per instruction model, a hierarchical memory model, and several
   multi-level interconnection network models. Multiple device-and
   system-level design parameters are simultaneously optimized to maximize
   the chip throughput for a given device technology and an architecture
   family under certain power, thermal and die size budgets. In the
   single-core processor analysis, a high-performance (HP) 25 mm FinFET
   processor can provide 26\% more throughput than its planar HP
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) counterpart, and a
   low-power (LP) tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) processor can offer
   more than 2X improvement in throughput compared with its LP FinFET
   counterpart at the 16 nm technology node. For various technology nodes,
   an accurate power-law relation is observed between the throughput and
   the die size area for a relatively small processor. In the multi-core
   processor analyses, multiple device-and system-level design parameters
   are obtained for both HP and LP applications with symmetric and
   asymmetric configurations. For a heterogeneous CMOS-TFET multi-core
   processor, about 45\% throughput improvement and 50\% energy reduction
   are observed compared with a FinFET processor at a 5 W power budget.}},

Abstract = {{The state feedback linear-quadratic optimal control problem for
   asymptotic stabilization has been extensively studied in the literature.
   In this paper, the optimal linear and nonlinear control problem is
   extended to address a weaker version of closed-loop stability, namely,
   semistability, which involves convergent trajectories and Lyapunov
   stable equilibria and which is of paramount importance for consensus
   control of network dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that the
   optimal semistable state-feedback controller can be solved using a form
   of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman conditions that does not require the
   cost-to-go function to be sign definite. This result is then used to
   solve the optimal linear-quadratic regulator problem using a Riccati
   equation approach. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to
   demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed linear and nonlinear
   semistabilization framework. (C) 2014 The Franklin Institute. Published

Abstract = {{In the field of nanofabrication, engineers often face unique challenges
   in resource-limited experimental budgets, the sensitive nature of
   process behavior with respect to controllable variables, and highly
   demanding tolerance requirements. To effectively overcome these
   challenges, this article proposes a methodology for a sequential design
   of experiments through batches of experimental runs, aptly named Layers
   of Experiments with Adaptive Combined Design (LoE/ACD). In higher
   layers, where process behavior is less understood, experimental regions
   cover more design space and data points are more spread out. In lower
   layers, experimental regions are more focused to improve understanding
   of process sensitivities in a local, data-rich environment. The
   experimental design is a combination of a space-filling and an optimal
   design with a tuning parameter that is dependent on the amount of
   information accumulated over the various layers. The proposed LoE/ACD
   method is applied to optimize a carbon dioxide (epet-CO2) assisted
   deposition process for fabricating silver nanoparticles with pressure
   and temperature variables. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval

Title = {{Numerical simulation of particulate flow in interconnected porous media
   for central particle-heating receiver applications}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{14-24}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The use of central solar particle-heating receivers (SPR) in
   concentrated solar power (CSP) systems offers numerous advantages over
   other central receiver concepts. The two main advantages are: (1)
   ordinary particulate minerals can allow collection temperatures
   approaching 1000 degrees C compared with conventional molten salts which
   are limited to about 650 degrees C, and (2) the low-cost high
   temperature particulate material can also be used as the storage medium
   in a highly cost effective thermal energy storage system. An innovative
   SPR design invented by researchers at King Saud University and Georgia
   Institute of Technology allows the particulate material to flow downward
   through a stationary porous structure where the concentrated solar
   energy is absorbed. The porous structure reduces the speed of the
   falling particulate material, i.e. increases its residence time within
   the receiver, thereby allowing a large temperature rise to be achieved
   in a single pass. The design increases absorption of the incident solar
   radiation (i.e. receiver efficiency) and reduces convective heat loss
   and particle loss (Al-Ansary et al., 2013). A numerical two-fluid
   solid-gas Eulerian-Eulerian flow model has been used to evaluate the
   effect of the porous structure on particulate flow through the receiver.
   The stationary porous structure was modeled using the packed bed concept
   in the FLUENT commercial CFD code. Two benchmarking experiments were
   conducted to assess the validity of the two-fluid flow and packed bed
   model for flow through the porous structure. This paper describes the
   two benchmarking experiments, and provides a comparison between the
   model predictions and the measured data. In the first experiment,
   particle flow rates through variable-width slits at the bottom of a
   constant head plenum were measured. In the second experiment, a porous
   layer was placed above the opening at the bottom of the constant head
   plenum to limit the particle discharge flow. Experiments with two
   different porous layer heights were conducted using two particle
   materials with different diameters and densities. The simulation results
   were in reasonable agreement with the test data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Comparing the Cost-Effectiveness of Rituximab Maintenance and

   Therapy in Patients with Follicular Lymphoma}},
Journal = {{VALUE IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Phase 3 randomized trials have shown that maintenance
   rituximab (MR) therapy or radioimmunotherapy (R11) consolidation
   following frontline therapy can improve progression-free survival for
   patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), but the costeffectiveness of
   these approaches with respect to observation has not been examined using
   a common modeling framework. Objectives: To evaluate and compare the
   economic impact of MR and RI!' consolidation versus observation,
   respectively, following the firstline induction therapy for patients
   with advanced-stage FL. Methods: We developed Markov models to estimate
   patients' lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and
   life-years (LYs) after MR, RI'!', and observation following frontline FL
   treatment from the US payer's perspective. Progression risks, adverse
   event probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from clinical
   data of Primary Rltuximab and MAintenance (PRIMA) trial, Eastern
   Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (for MR), and First line
   Indolent Trial (for RIT) and the published literature. We evaluated the
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for direct comparisons between
   MR/RI!' and observation. Model robustness was addressed by one-way and
   probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with observation,
   MR provided an additional 1.089 QALYs (1.099 LYs) and 1.399 QALYs (1.391
   LYs) on the basis of the PRIMA trial and the ECOG trial, respectively,
   and RIT provided an additional 1.026 QALYs (1.034 LYs). The incremental
   cost per QALY gained was \$40,335 (PRIMA) or \$37,412 (ECOG) for MR and
   \$40,851 for RIT. MR and RIT had comparable incremental QALYs before
   first progression, whereas RI'!' had higher incremental costs of adverse
   events due to higher incidences of cytopenias. Conclusions: MR and RIT
   following frontline FL therapy demonstrated favorable and similar
   cost-effectiveness profiles. The model results should be interpreted
   within the specific clinical settings of each trial. Selection of MR,
   RIT, or observation should be based on patient characteristics and
   expected trade-offs for these alternatives.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Background. Single ventricle lesions are associated with gradual
   attrition after surgical palliation with the total cavopulmonary
   connection (TCPC). Ventricular dysfunction is frequently noted,
   particularly impaired diastolic performance. This study seeks to relate
   TCPC hemodynamic energy losses to single ventricle volumes and filling
   characteristics.
   Methods. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data were retrospectively
   analyzed for 30 single ventricle patients at an average age of 12.7 +/-
   4.8 years. Cine ventricular short-axis scans were semiautomatically
   segmented for all cardiac phases. Ventricular volumes, ejection
   fraction, peak filling rate, peak ejection rate, and time to peak
   filling were calculated. Corresponding patient-specific TCPC geometry
   was acquired from a stack of transverse CMR images; relevant flow rates
   were segmented from through-plane phase contrast CMR data at TCPC inlets
   and outlets. The TCPC indexed power loss was calculated from
   computational fluid dynamics simulations using a validated custom
   solver. Time-averaged flow conditions and rigid vessel walls were
   assumed in all cases. Pearson correlations were used to detect
   relationships between variables, with p less than 0.05 considered
   significant.
   Results. Ventricular end-diastolic (R = -0.48) and stroke volumes (R =
   -0.37) had significant negative correlations with the natural logarithm
   of a flow-independent measure of power loss. This power loss measure
   also had a significant positive relationship to time to peak filling
   rate (normalized to cycle time; R = 0.67).
   Conclusions. Flow-independent TCPC power loss is inversely related with
   ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes. Elevated power losses may
   contribute to impaired diastolic filling and limited preload reserve in
   single ventricle patients. (C) 2015 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Atlantic salmon Salmo solar undergo months-long inappetence during
   spawning, but it is not known whether this inappetence is a pathological
   state or one for which the fish are adapted. Recent work has shown that
   inappetent whale sharks can exhibit circulating metabolite profiles
   similar to ketosis known to occur in humans during starvation. In this
   work, metabolite profiling was used to explore differences in analyte
   profiles between a cohort of inappetent spawning run Atlantic salmon and
   captively reared animals that were fed up to and through the time of
   sampling. The two classes of animals were easily distinguished by their
   metabolite profiles. The searun fish had elevated omega-9 fatty acids
   relative to the domestic feeding animals, while other fatty acid
   concentrations were reduced. Sugar alcohols were generally elevated in
   inappetent animals, suggesting potentially novel metabolic responses or
   pathways in fish that feature these compounds. Compounds expected to
   indicate a pathological catabolic state were not more abundant in the
   sea-run fish, suggesting that the animals, while inappetent. were not
   stressed in an unnatural way. These findings demonstrate the power of
   discovery-based metabolomics for exploring biochemistry in poorly
   understood animal models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Internet protocol television (IPTV), the television services through the
   Internet, has recently gained increasing popularity. One key advantage
   of IPTV over the traditional terrestrial TV, satellite TV, and cable TV
   is that it makes the TV viewing experience more interactive and
   personalized. Many efforts have been made for delivering personalized
   IPTV services, of which understanding user preferences is the most
   critical. A key challenge in analyzing IPTV user behaviors is that
   multiple individuals may be associated with an IPTV account, thus making
   it difficult to identify individual users. We propose a novel time-topic
   coupled latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, which considers the
   topic of TV programs viewed as well as the timestamps of the viewing
   behaviors, in order to capture the inherent viewing patterns of
   individual users along the topic as well as the time dimensions. Based
   on the coupled LDA model, we further summarize the behavior patterns of
   IPTV users. We perform an in-depth study on several intrinsic
   characteristics of IPTV user activities by analyzing the real-world data
   collected from an operational nation-wide IPTV system in China and show
   that the proposed coupled LDA model is able to capture interesting
   viewing patterns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a circuit in which tungsten oxide-based analog
   memristors are post-processed on a CMOS-based Field-Programmable Analog
   Array Integrated Circuit (FPAA-IC). FPAAs are powerful tools for rapid
   analog experimentation, prototyping and power-efficient computing, and
   they allow custom analog circuits to be built and reconfigured. The
   primary motivation for this work is to introduce and demonstrate the
   operation of the FPAA/memristor hybrid circuit and the board-level
   infrastructure, and to form a basis for subsequent empirical work on
   analog memristive computing. The experiments shown in this paper
   demonstrate a successful fabrication of memristors on the FPAA
   substrate, and the usefulness of the hybrid computing infrastructure in
   terms of experimentation with memristors. The experiments suggest that a
   single state variable cannot capture the adaptation of a memristor. To
   this end, a SPICE compatible memristor model with two state variables is
   presented. Furthermore, a memristor-based adaptive coincidence detector
   is demonstrated on the FPAA/Memristor computing infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel finite-state-machine (FSM) representation
   of long-term load operating waveforms for feature extraction and load
   identification. An operating waveform is first converted into a
   quantized sequence of states. Each state is assigned with 2-D numerical
   values: root mean square (RMS) current values and staying time values. A
   set of elemental states and events are defined to reduce the number of
   states and extract numerical features to represent electric loads for
   classification and identification. Three major categories of repeating
   patterns in waveforms that correspond to repeating operating actions are
   summarized and identification methods are proposed for each such
   category. Test results using a large dataset of real-world waveforms
   show that the different appliances have distinct ranges of features
   extracted from the proposed FSM representation, and thus can be
   identified with high accuracy.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Managing the widely distributed wood pole assets owned by typical
   electric power utilities in the USA is challenging in the absence of
   appropriate analytical tools. The traditional method of inspecting poles
   by headquarters or strictly age is insufficient for effective management
   since natural hazards cause the largest instantaneous pole replacements.
   A probabilistic framework is developed and presented in this paper to
   address this issue. Fragility assessment is conducted using Latin
   hypercube sampling to estimate pole failure probabilities conditional on
   wind speed intensities. Failure probability estimates are obtained using
   age-dependent fragility functions and appropriate distribution functions
   for maximum 3 s wind gust speeds. Pole locations from an electric power
   utility's database management system were imported into ArcMap, a
   component of Environmental Systems Research Institute geospatial
   processing program. Age distributions were extracted by county and used
   to estimate expected pole failures. A sort-algorithm on the failures-the
   inspection order indices gives the proposed appropriate order of pole
   locations to be inspected. These calculated values were added as a data
   layer into ArcMap generating a geospatial visualization of both the
   orders of pole inspections and probabilistic pole loss estimates for the
   electric utility by counties. Applying the framework will increase
   utilities' visibility into the vulnerability of their pole plants.
   Emergency preparedness will also improve, strengthening
   customer-perception on utilities' maintenance efforts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{522}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Seawater intrusion in response to sea-level rise has been studied
   extensively in recent years by assuming largely a constant-head or
   constant-flux inland boundary condition. However, these two types of
   boundary conditions are not sufficient when the inland edge of the model
   domain is neither natural groundwater nor known hydraulic boundaries.
   Under these circumstances, a general-head inland boundary condition
   capable of characterizing the hydraulic response of model boundaries is
   needed. Previous studies adopting the general-head inland boundary
   condition to assess coastal aquifer vulnerability to sea-level rise are
   limited and all based on numerical modeling. In this study, we derive
   analytical solutions of the interface toe location in both confined and
   unconfined coastal systems with a general-head inland boundary
   condition. Comparison among the performances of the three different
   types of inland boundary conditions in evaluating the sea-level rise
   impact on aquifer salinization is carried out by assuming the same
   initial system condition. It is found that the displacement of the
   interface toe predicted using a general-head inland boundary is between
   those of using a constant-head (upper bound) and constant-flux (lower
   bound) inland boundary, depending on the values of two general-head
   boundary parameters (i.e., hydraulic conductance and reference head).
   More importantly, analytical solutions developed could serve as a tool
   for calibrating the two boundary parameters defined in the general-head
   boundary condition for site-specific assessments. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

Abstract = {{The spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes

   Recognition and timely diagnosis of these different stages, particularly

   complications. Liver biopsy remains the clinical standard for definitive
   diagnosis. Diagnostic tools minimizing the need for invasive procedures

   metabolites, aqueous intracellular metabolites, SNPs, and mRNA
   transcripts in a double-blinded study of patients with different stages
   of NAFLD that involves profiling liver biopsies, plasma, and urine
   samples. Using linear discriminant analysis, a panel of 20 plasma
   metabolites that includes glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols,
   and various aqueous small molecular weight components involved in
   cellular metabolic pathways, can be used to differentiate between NASH
   and steatosis. This identification of differential biomolecular
   signatures has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis and
   facilitate therapeutic intervention of NAFLD.}},

Abstract = {{The transmittance of simple one-dimensional gratings and two-dimensional
   pillar arrays is usually broadband with poor selectivity in the infrared
   region. In this paper, it is demonstrated that covering graphene on top
   of a Ag grating will improve both the magnitude and coherence of the
   transmitted infrared radiation. The underlying mechanism of this
   anomalous blocking-assisted transmission is attributed to the excitation
   of localized magnetic resonances. Quantitative predictions of the
   resonance wavelength for different geometric parameters and graphene
   chemical potentials are provided based on the equivalent-circuit model.
   The enhancement is alignment-free and actively tunable. Such
   graphene-covered gratings may help improve the performance and
   robustness of optical devices, such as polarizers, color filters,

Abstract = {{Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has found widespread clinical
   application in recent years. A large number of treatment planning
   studies have evaluated the potential for VMAT for different disease
   sites based on the currently available commercial implementations of
   VMAT planning. In contrast, literature on the underlying mathematical
   optimization methods used in treatment planning is scarce. VMAT planning
   represents a challenging large scale optimization problem. In contrast
   to fluence map optimization in intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning
   for static beams, VMAT planning represents a nonconvex optimization
   problem. In this paper, the authors review the state-of-the-art in VMAT
   planning from an algorithmic perspective. Different approaches to VMAT
   optimization, including arc sequencing methods, extensions of direct
   aperture optimization, and direct optimization of leaf trajectories are
   reviewed. Their advantages and limitations are outlined and
   recommendations for improvements are discussed. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Udwadia-Kalaba equation is a simple, aesthetic and thought-provoking
   description of the world at a very fundamental level. It is about the
   way systems of bodies move. We creatively apply the Udwadia-Kalaba
   approach to study falling cat's movements. The cat is modeled as a
   constrained discrete dynamical system. In an alternative way,
   Udwadia-Kalaba formulation is used for analysis of the falling cat's
   dynamics. With this novel approach, we can easily obtain the dynamical
   model and get the explicit analytic form of the general equations of
   motion of the falling cat. The surprise phenomenon (that a cat when
   dropped at rest with its feet pointing up can always manage to right
   itself and land safely on its feet) is observed through numerical
   simulation based on the constructed dynamical model. Unmatched ease,
   clarity and elegance of the Udwadia-Kalaba formulation for solving the
   falling cat problem (constrained discrete dynamical system or multibody
   system) are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-two papers on the study of tsunamis are included in Volume I of
   the PAGEOPH topical issue ``Tsunami Science: Ten Years after the 2004

   tsunami warning and forecast, including the improvement of existing
   tsunami warning systems and the development of new warning systems in
   the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean region. Three more papers
   present the results of analytical studies and discuss benchmark
   problems. Four papers report the impacts of tsunamis, including the
   detailed calculation of inundation onshore and into rivers and
   probabilistic analysis for engineering purposes. The final two papers
   relate to important investigations of the source and tsunami generation.
   Overall, the volume not only addresses the pivotal 2004 Indian Ocean
   (Sumatra) and 2011 Japan (Tohoku) tsunamis, but also examines the
   tsunami hazard posed to other critical coasts in the world.}},

Abstract = {{Within weeks of the Solomon Islands earthquake of 1 April 2007,
   international tsunami survey teams discovered important biomarkers of
   crust rupture and tsunami heights along the islands' coastlines.
   Deep-ocean tsunameters recorded the tsunami waves of this event,
   enabling a real-time inversion of the tsunami source and model
   evaluation of near-field tsunami impact. The survey measurements provide
   valuable datasets for further confirmation of the tsunami source of the
   1 April 2007 Solomon earthquake. These survey results also aided
   investigation of the correlation between sources determined by use of
   tsunameter records and those derived from seismometer records or
   crust-rupture measurements. In this study, to assess the near-field
   tsunami impact, we developed tsunami inundation models for the Solomon
   Islands, including tsunami waveforms, co-seismic land-level changes, and
   tsunami height distributions on individual islands. Compared with
   seismic-derived tsunami sources, modeling results based on the
   tsunameter-derived tsunami sources were a good match with field survey
   measurements. These results highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the
   tsunameter-derived tsunami source in modeling the near-field tsunami
   impact along a complex archipelago. We show that the source models,
   although derived by use of different methods, are all suited to
   initiation of inundation models developed for Solomon Islands. As these
   source models become available in real time or near real time, they can
   be implemented immediately in the inundation models to provide rapid
   guidance on tsunami hazard assessment, focused search and rescue
   operations, and post-event recovery and reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{The `teleportation test' has been used in travel behaviour research for
   more than a decade, as a means of assessing whether an individual views
   travel purely as a disutility. The teleportation concept has been used
   successfully in qualitative research to elicit responses and clarify
   attitudes to travel time. However, survey-based studies have revealed an
   apparent inconsistency, in that many people who report an ideal travel
   time greater than zero, and/or do not consider their travel time as
   wasted, also report wanting to teleport. This note reviews a range of

Abstract = {{Recycling lithium from waste lithium batteries is a growing problem, and
   new technologies are needed to recover the lithium. Currently, there is
   a lack of highly selective adsorption/ion exchange materials that can be
   used to recover lithium. We have developed a magnetic lithium
   ion-imprinted polymer (Fe3O4@SiO2@IIP) by using novel crown ether. The
   Fe3O4@SiO2@IIP has been synthesized by a surface imprinting technique
   using our newly synthesized 2-(allyloxy) methyl-12-crown-4 as a
   functional monomer. The Fe3O4@SiO2@IIP was analyzed by Fourier infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). The optimum pH for adsorption is 6. Fe3O4@SiO2@IIP
   shows fast adsorption kinetics for lithium ions (10 mm to reach complete
   equilibrium), and the adsorption process obeys an external mass transfer
   model. Homogeneous binding sites are proved by the Langmuir isotherm,
   and the maximum adsorption capacity is 0.586 mmol/g. Fe3O4@SiO2@IIP has
   excellent selectivity for Li(I) because the selectivity separation
   factors of Li(I) with respect to Na(I), K(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II) are
   50.88, 42.38, 22.5, and 22.2, respectively. The adsorption capacity of
   sorbent remained above 92\% after five cycles. Fixed-bed column
   adsorption experiments indicate that the effective treatment volume was
   140 bed volumes (BV) in the first run with a breakthrough of 10\% of the
   inlet concentration for an inlet concentration of 0.5 mmol/L and 110 BV
   was treated for the second run under identical conditions. We
   demonstrated that 89.8\% of the lithium was recovered during bed
   regeneration using 0.5 mol/L HCl solution. Fe3O4@SiO2@IIP also exhibited
   excellent removal efficiency for Li(I) in real wastewater, validating
   its great potential in advanced wastewater treatment. Accordingly, we
   have developed a new method for wastewater treatment that meets Li
   emission standards, and recovery of Li creates economic interest.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report a method to synthesize Volatile Organic Compounds
   (VOCs)-free expandable polystyrene beads containing well-dispersed water
   microdroplets as blowing agent. The water expandable beads were prepared
   through surfactant free Pickering emulsion polymerization of styrene in
   water/oil/water (w/o/w) system using cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). The
   water microdroplets were shown to be surrounded by a dense layer of
   CNF/polystyrene composite (CNF/PS) nanospheres which formed in the
   initial stages of the process and were in situ surface-modified by
   styrene-maleic anhydride (SMA) to act as stabilizer. The formation
   mechanism of the CNF/PS nanospheres was confirmed by infra-red
   spectroscopy and contact angle analysis. Morphological characterization
   of unexpanded polystyrene beads showed that the number droplet density
   as well as total entrapped water in the beads increased with the CNF
   content. Furthermore, a bimodal distribution of water droplet size,
   centered at 3 and 6 mu m and a linear correlation between the average
   water droplet size and the average size of the CNF/PS nanospheres was
   found. Finally, it was shown that the under appropriate condition, the
   beads can be excellently expanded to form a low density polystyrene
   foam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As the technology scales down to the sub-10 nm nodes, the interconnect
   performance becomes primarily dominated by the resistance rather than
   the capacitance due to the ever-increasing size effects of copper and a
   higher input capacitance of the devices. The implications of this
   paradigm shift are discussed in this letter, and it is shown that the
   local interconnect technology needs to be reoptimized to rebalance the
   interconnect resistance and capacitance. One approach is to increase the
   interconnect width beyond half pitch without changing the interconnect
   pitch. For the 5-nm technology node with an aspect ratio of 3, the
   energy-delay product of vertical field-effect transistor circuits at the
   optimal relative width improve up 55\%, compared with the circuits using
   an aspect ratio of 2 and an interconnect width of half pitch.}},

Abstract = {{The problems of singularity formation and hydrostatic stress created by
   an inhomogeneity with eigenstrain in an incompressible isotropic
   hyperelastic material are considered. For both a spherical ball and a
   cylindrical bar with a radially symmetric distribution of finite
   possibly anisotropic eigenstrains, we show that the anisotropy of these
   eigenstrains at the center (the center of the sphere or the axis of the
   cylinder) controls the stress singularity. If they are equal at the
   center no stress singularity develops but if they are not equal then
   stress always develops a logarithmic singularity. In both cases, the
   energy density and strains are everywhere finite. As a related problem,
   we consider annular inclusions for which the eigenstrains vanish in a
   core around the center. We show that even for an anisotropic
   distribution of eigenstrains, the stress inside the core is always
   hydrostatic. We show how these general results are connected to recent
   claims on similar problems in the limit of small eigenstrains. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This study explores how the presence of nanofillers with different
   structural and chemical characteristics, specifically silica
   nanoparticles and exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (GNP), alters the
   crystallization behavior and polymorphism of a semicrystalline polymer,
   such as polypropylene (PP). The main focus of this research is to
   investigate how silica and GNP affect the nucleation and growth of PP
   crystals during isothermal crystallization. The nonisothermal
   crystallization behavior, including crystal structures, crystallization
   temperature, and rate, is also determined. PP composites with
   nanomaterial content up to 7 wt\% were produced by melt mixing and
   injection molding. Both silica and graphite were found to be effective
   nucleating agents, significantly increasing the crystallization rate
   during isothermal crystallization, with greater changes observed in case
   of GNP composites. The effect of filler type and amount on the PP
   polymorphism and lamella thickness was studied by X-ray diffraction and
   modulated differential scanning calorimetry. Both silica and graphite
   were found to be effective nucleating agents for the less common -phase
   of PP crystals even at low nanomaterial concentration. --crystal
   perfection and the recrystallization of the -form in the -form and/or at
   the transcrystalline regime were found to be responsible for the
   recrystallization occurring upon melting in nanocomposites at high

Abstract = {{Rotating blades at high advance ratios can experience reverse flow on
   the retreating side of the rotor disc, where the freestream flow is
   directed from the sharp trailing edge of the blade to the blunt leading
   edge. Better understanding of this flow regime can help advance the
   design of high-speed rotorcraft. In this work, it is hypothesized that
   the sharp trailing edge of a reverse flow blade develops an attached
   vortex in a similar manner to a sharp-edged delta wing. Lift, drag, and
   pitching moment data for a static yawed blade in reverse flow are
   acquired using a load cell and the lift measurements are compared to
   predictions made with an adaptation of the Polhamus model. Surface tuft
   flow visualization confirms the presence of an attached spanwise vortex
   on the blade. Surface flow behavior is used to explain the behavior of
   observed aerodynamic loads, and correlations are made to previous
   results found in the literature. Vorticity transport analysis is used to
   justify the surface flow behavior variation with yaw angle and angle of
   attack.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling-based approach is presented to understand physically
   realistic and technologically interesting material properties and
   operating configurations of packed-bed membrane reactors (PBMRs) for
   propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PBMRs composed of microporous or
   mesoporous membranes combined with a PDH catalyst are considered. The
   influence of reaction and membrane transport parameters, as well as
   operating parameters such as sweep flow and catalyst placement, are
   investigated to determine desired operating windows for isothermal and
   nonisothermal operation. Higher Damkohler (Da) and lower Peclet (Pe)
   numbers are generally helpful, but are much more beneficial with highly
   H-2-selective membranes rather than higher-flux, lower-selectivity
   membranes. H-2-selective membranes show a plateau region of conversion
   that can be overcome by a large sweep flow or countercurrent operation.
   The latter shows a complex trade-off between kinetics and permeation,
   and is effective only in a limited window. H-2-selective PBMRs will
   greatly benefit from the fabrication of thin (approximate to 1 mu m or
   less) membranes. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE

Title = {{Alginate Encapsulant Incorporating CXCL12 Supports Long-Term Allo- and

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Islet transplantation represents a potentially curative approach for
   individuals with Type I Diabetes. The requirement for systemic immune
   suppression to control immune-mediated rejection of transplanted islets
   and the limited human islet supply represent significant roadblocks to
   progress for this approach. Islet microencapsulation in alginate offers
   limited protection in the absence of systemic immunosuppression, but
   does not support long-term islet survival. The chemokine, CXCL12, can
   repel effector T cells while recruiting immune-suppressive regulatory T
   cells (Tregs) to an anatomic site while providing a prosurvival signal
   for beta-cells. We proposed that coating or encapsulating donor islets
   with CXCL12 would induce local immune-isolation and protect and support
   the function of an allo- or xenograft without systemic immune
   suppression. This study investigated the effect of alginate
   microcapsules incorporating CXCL12 on islet function. Islet
   transplantation was performed in murine models of insulin-dependent
   diabetes. Coating of islets with CXCL12 or microencapsulation of islets
   with alginate incorporating the chemokine, resulted in long-term allo-
   and xenoislet survival and function, as well as a selective increase in
   intragraft Tregs. These data support the use of CXCL12 as a coating or a
   component of an alginate encapsulant to induce sustained local
   immune-isolation for allo- or xenoislet transplantation without systemic
   immunosuppression.
   An alginate microencapsulant incorporating CXCL12 acts as a T cell
   chemorepellent and an islet prosurvival factor that supports long-term
   allo- and xenoislet transplantation without systemic immune suppression
   in mouse models of diabetes.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{46-58}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new hand controller interface that addresses
   practical challenges to implementing coordinated position control (CPC)
   for an excavator arm. The new interface uses a hybrid control scheme
   with closed-loop CPC of the excavator arm and open-loop flow control of
   the swing. CPC is achieved using a joystick that is kinematically
   similar to the excavator arm. The kinematically similar joystick motion
   is planar. Thus, it can be mounted vertically, matching the excavator
   arm, or horizontally, which has many advantages, such as reduced
   operator fatigue. The new interface is compared to a conventional
   interface in a human subject experiment using a dynamic excavator
   simulator. The results demonstrate similar improvements in spoil removed
   and fuel efficiency as previous CPC approaches while being more
   practically designed. Although the design is for an excavator, the
   concepts presented can apply to a range of hydraulic manipulators. (C)

Title = {{Water distribution in dentin matrices: Bound vs. unbound water}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. This work measured the amount of bound versus unbound water
   in completely-demineralized dentin.
   Methods. Dentin beams prepared from extracted human teeth were
   completely demineralized, rinsed and dried to constant mass. They were
   rehydrated in 41\% relative humidity (RH), while gravimetrically
   measuring their mass increase until the first plateau was reached at
   0.064 (vacuum) or 0.116 g H2O/g dry mass (Drierite). The specimens were
   then exposed to 60\% RH until attaining the second plateau at 0.220
   (vacuum) or 0.191 g H2O/g dry mass (Drierite), and subsequently exposed
   to 99\% RH until attaining the third plateau at 0.493 (vacuum) or 0.401
   g H2O/g dry mass (Drierite).
   Results. Exposure of the first layer of bound water to 0\% RH for 5 min
   produced a -0.3\% loss of bound water; in the second layer of bound
   water it caused a -3.3\% loss of bound water; in the third layer it
   caused a -6\% loss of bound water. Immersion in 100\% ethanol or acetone
   for 5 min produced a 2.8 and 1.9\% loss of bound water from the first
   layer, respectively; it caused a -4 and -7\% loss of bound water in the
   second layer, respectively; and a -17 and -23\% loss of bound water in
   the third layer. Bound water represented 21-25\% of total dentin water.
   Chemical dehydration of water-saturated dentin with ethanol/acetone for
   1 min only removed between 25 and 35\% of unbound water, respectively.
   Signcance. Attempts to remove bound water by evaporation were not very
   successful. Chemical dehydration with 100\% acetone was more successful
   than 100\% ethanol especially the third layer of bound water. Since
   unbound water represents between 75 and 79\% of total matrix water, the
   more such water can be removed, the more resin can be infiltrated. (C)

Abstract = {{Pattern classification for intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals has furthered
   epilepsy research toward understanding the origin of epileptic seizures
   and localizing dysfunctional brain tissue for treatment. Prior research
   has demonstrated that implicitly selecting features with a genetic
   programming (GP) algorithm more effectively determined the proper
   features to discern biomarker and non-biomarker interictal iEEG and fMRI
   activity than conventional feature selection approaches. However for
   each the iEEG and fMRI modalities, it is still uncertain whether the
   stochastic properties of indirect feature selection with a GP yield (a)
   consistent results within a patient data set and (b) features that are
   specific or universal across multiple patient data sets. We examined the
   reproducibility of implicitly selecting features to classify interictal
   activity using a GP algorithm by performing several selection trials and
   subsequent frequent itemset mining (FIM) for separate iEEG and fMRI
   epilepsy patient data. We observed within-subject consistency and
   across-subject variability with some small similarity for selected
   features, indicating a clear need for patient-specific features and
   possible need for patient-specific feature selection or/and
   classification. For the fMRI, using nearest-neighbor classification and
   30 GP generations, we obtained over 60\% median sensitivity and over
   60\% median selectivity. For the iEEG, using nearest-neighbor
   classification and 30 GP generations, we obtained over 65\% median
   sensitivity and over 65\% median selectivity except one patient. (C)

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{71-84}},

Abstract = {{In recent work, we have demonstrated the viability and computational
   advantages of using a compact database of discrete Fourier transforms
   (DFTs) for facilitating crystal plasticity solutions in cubic
   polycrystalline materials subjected to arbitrary deformation paths. This
   new DFT database approach allows for compact representation and fast
   retrieval of crystal plasticity solutions, which is found to be able to
   speed up the calculations by about two orders of magnitude. In this
   paper, we present the first successful implementation of this spectral
   database approach in a commercial finite element code to permit
   computationally efficient simulations of heterogeneous deformations
   using crystal plasticity theories. More specifically, the spectral
   database approach to crystal plasticity solutions was successfully
   integrated with the commercial finite element package ABAQUS through a
   user material subroutine, UMAT. Details of this new crystal plasticity
   spectral database-FE approach are demonstrated and validated through a
   few example case studies for selected deformation processes on face
   centered and body centered cubic metals. The evolution of the underlying
   crystallographic texture and its associated macroscale anisotropic
   properties predicted from this new approach are compared against the
   corresponding results from the conventional crystal plasticity finite
   element method. It is observed that implementing the crystal plasticity
   spectral database in a FE code produced excellent predictions similar to
   the classical crystal plasticity FE method, but at a significantly
   faster computational speed and much lower computational cost. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The PA4203 gene encodes a LysR regulator and lies between the ppgL gene
   (PA4204), which encodes a periplasmic gluconolactonase, and, in the
   opposite orientation, the PA4202 (nmoA) gene, coding for a nitronate
   monooxygenase, and ddlA (PA4201), encoding a D-alanine alanine ligase.
   The intergenic regions between PA4203 and ppgL and between PA4203 and
   nmoA are very short (79 and 107 nucleotides, respectively). Here we show
   that PA4203 (nmoR) represses its own transcription and the expression of
   nmoA. A chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the presence of a
   single NmoR binding site between nmoA and nmoR, which was confirmed by
   electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with the purified NmoR
   protein. Despite this observation, a transcriptome analysis revealed
   more genes to be affected in an nmoR mutant, including genes known to be
   part of the MexT LysR activator regulon. The PA1225 gene, encoding a
   quinone oxidoreductase, was the most highly upregulated gene in the nmoR
   deletion mutant, independently of MexT. Finally, deletion of the nmoA
   gene resulted in an increased sensitivity of the cells to
   3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), confirming the role of the nitronate
   monooxygenase protein in the detoxification of nitronate.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of guided projectile systems are inherently stochastic in
   nature. While deterministic control algorithms such as impact point
   prediction (IPP) may prove effective in many scenarios, the probability
   of impacting obstacles and constrained areas within an impact zone
   cannot be accounted for without accurate uncertainty modeling. A
   stochastic model predictive guidance algorithm is developed, which
   incorporates nonlinear uncertainty propagation to predict the impact
   probability density in real-time. Once the impact distribution is
   characterized, the guidance system aim point is computed as the solution
   to an optimization problem. The result is a guidance law that can
   achieve minimum miss distance while avoiding impact area constraints.
   Furthermore, the acceptable risk of obstacle impact can be quantified
   and tuned online. Example trajectories and Monte Carlo simulations
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic control
   formulation in comparison to deterministic guidance schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated bias caused by spatial variability and
   spatial heterogeneity in outdoor air-pollutant concentrations,
   instrument imprecision, and choice of daily pollutant metric on risk
   ratio (RR) estimates obtained from a Poisson time-series analysis. Daily
   concentrations for 12 pollutants were simulated for Atlanta, Georgia, at
   5 km resolution during a 6-year period. Viewing these as being
   representative of the true concentrations, a population-level pollutant
   health effect (RR) was specified, and daily counts of health events were
   simulated. Error representative of instrument imprecision was added to
   the simulated concentrations at the locations of fixed site monitors in
   Atlanta, and these mismeasured values were combined to create three
   different city-wide daily metrics (central monitor, unweighted average,
   and population-weighted average). Given our assumptions, the median bias
   in the RR per unit increase in concentration was found to be lowest for
   the population-weighted average metric. Although the Berkson component
   of error caused bias away from the null in the log-linear models, the
   net bias due to measurement error tended to be towards the null. The
   relative differences in bias among the metrics were lessened, although
   not eliminated, by scaling results to interquartile range increases in
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The response of physical models of beach profiles to random breaking
   waves was studied to investigate size-selective sediment transport and
   cross-shore profile evolution. Three types of beach profiles with
   different sediment mixtures were considered and subjected to waves until
   profiles reached equilibrium. Size-selective sediment transport was
   evident in the experiments, with the mean sediment size varying up to
   20\% along the beach profiles. Consistent coarsening and fining of the
   surface sediment in the experiments revealed size-selective sediment
   transport governed by cross-shore variations in energy dissipation,
   affecting important beach profile features such as sandbar structures
   and offshore and foreshore slopes. The theoretical basis of the
   transport phenomenon was described by analyzing the relationship between
   the transport processes and essential wave and hydrodynamic parameters
   obtained using a new set of numerical models. The results showed that
   beach profile changes and associated sediment grain sorting are most
   sensitive to instantaneous total water velocity and local energy flux
   under propagating waves. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   the dependency between packet spaces spanned by different nodes in a
   stochastic way. Then we simplify the result by means of the
   approximation. By the dependency analysis, we can accurately update
   nodes' innovativeness rank. Second, via tracking the innovativeness
   ranks of all nodes, we develop an analytic framework to iteratively
   compute the cumulative distribution function of the block delivery
   delay. Our simulation results verify that both parts of our analysis are

Abstract = {{Neural electrodes are an important part of brain-machine interface
   devices that can restore functionality to patients with sensory and
   movement disorders. Chronically implanted neural electrodes induce an
   unfavorable tissue response which includes inflammation, scar formation,
   and neuronal cell death, eventually causing loss of electrode function.
   We developed a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel coating for neural
   electrodes with non-fouling characteristics, incorporated an
   anti-inflammatory agent, and engineered a stimulus-responsive degradable
   portion for on-demand release of the anti-inflammatory agent in response
   to inflammatory stimuli. This coating reduces in vitro glial cell
   adhesion, cell spreading, and cytokine release compared to uncoated
   controls. We also analyzed the in vivo tissue response using
   immunohistochemistry and microarray qRT-PCR. Although no differences
   were observed among coated and uncoated electrodes for inflammatory cell
   markers, lower IgG penetration into the tissue around PEG+IL-1Ra coated
   electrodes indicates an improvement in blood-brain barrier integrity.
   Gene expression analysis showed higher expression of IL-6 and MMP-2
   around PEG+IL-1Ra samples, as well as an increase in CNTF expression, an
   important marker for neuronal survival. Importantly, increased neuronal
   survival around coated electrodes compared to uncoated controls was
   observed. Collectively, these results indicate promising findings for an
   engineered coating to increase neuronal survival and improve tissue
   response around implanted neural electrodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{27-38}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Control of autonomous systems subject to stochastic uncertainty is a
   challenging task. In guided airdrop applications, random wind
   disturbances play a crucial role in determining landing accuracy and
   terrain avoidance. This paper describes a stochastic parafoil guidance
   system which couples uncertainty propagation with optimal control to
   protect against wind and parameter uncertainty in the presence of impact
   area obstacles. The algorithm uses real-time Monte Carlo simulation
   performed on a graphics processing unit (GPU) to evaluate robustness of
   candidate trajectories in terms of delivery accuracy, obstacle
   avoidance, and other considerations. Building upon prior theoretical
   developments, this paper explores performance of the stochastic guidance
   law compared to standard deterministic guidance schemes, particularly
   with respect to obstacle avoidance. Flight test results are presented
   comparing the proposed stochastic guidance algorithm with a standard
   deterministic one. Through a comprehensive set of simulation results,
   key implementation aspects of the stochastic algorithm are explored
   including tradeoffs between the number of candidate trajectories
   considered, algorithm runtime, and overall guidance performance.
   Overall, simulation and flight test results demonstrate that the
   stochastic guidance scheme provides a more robust approach to obstacle
   avoidance while largely maintaining delivery accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Modulation of hand aperture during reaching in persons with incomplete
   cervical spinal cord injury}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{233}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{871-884}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The intact neuromotor system prepares for object grasp by first opening
   the hand to an aperture that is scaled according to object size and then
   closing the hand around the object. After cervical spinal cord injury
   (SCI), hand function is significantly impaired, but the degree to which
   object-specific hand aperture scaling is affected remains unknown. Here,
   we hypothesized that persons with incomplete cervical SCI have a reduced
   maximum hand opening capacity but exhibit novel neuromuscular
   coordination strategies that permit object-specific hand aperture
   scaling during reaching. To test this hypothesis, we measured hand
   kinematics and surface electromyography from seven muscles of the hand
   and wrist during attempts at maximum hand opening as well as reaching
   for four balls of different diameters. Our results showed that persons
   with SCI exhibited significantly reduced maximum hand aperture compared
   to able-bodied (AB) controls. However, persons with SCI preserved the
   ability to scale peak hand aperture with ball size during reaching.
   Persons with SCI also used distinct muscle coordination patterns that
   included increased co-activity of flexors and extensors at the wrist and
   hand compared to AB controls. These results suggest that motor planning
   for aperture modulation is preserved even though execution is limited by
   constraints on hand opening capacity and altered muscle co-activity.
   Thus, persons with incomplete cervical SCI may benefit from
   rehabilitation aimed at increasing hand opening capacity and reducing
   flexor-extensor co-activity at the wrist and hand.}},

Abstract = {{Distance metric learning is a fundamental problem in data mining and
   knowledge discovery. Many representative data mining algorithms, such as
   -nearest neighbor classifier, hierarchical clustering and spectral
   clustering, heavily rely on the underlying distance metric for correctly
   measuring relations among input data. In recent years, many studies have
   demonstrated, either theoretically or empirically, that learning a good
   distance metric can greatly improve the performance of classification,
   clustering and retrieval tasks. In this survey, we overview existing
   distance metric learning approaches according to a common framework.
   Specifically, depending on the available supervision information during
   the distance metric learning process, we categorize each distance metric
   learning algorithm as supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised. We
   compare those different types of metric learning methods, point out
   their strength and limitations. Finally, we summarize open challenges in
   distance metric learning and propose future directions for distance
   metric learning.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on exploiting the sensor fusion capability for
   situation monitoring applications over a kind of relay assisted sensor
   networks consisting of multiple kinds of sensor nodes (SNs) and relay
   nodes (RNs). SNs implement assimilation of new measurement and
   cooperation with other nodes. Moreover, SNs have different sensing
   modalities, which can only measure a part of target parameter vector for
   situation monitoring. While for RNs, the main role is to aggregate their
   neighboring data. We propose a distributed consensus based unbiased
   estimation algorithm for this kind of relay assisted sensor networks. By
   using algebraic graph theory in conjunction with Markov chain approach,
   we demonstrate how the distributed estimation method can be transformed
   to circumvent the challenges arisen from the heterogeneity of different
   kinds of nodes. We analyze the performance of asymptotic unbiasedness
   and consistency of the proposed algorithm in the presence of asymmetric
   communication, i.e., when a node can receive information from another
   node but not vice versa. Furthermore, a quantitative bound on the rate
   of convergence of the proposed algorithm in the almost sure sense is
   explicitly established. Finally, simulation results are provided to
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{New metal/polymer composite filaments for fused deposition modeling
   (FDM) processes were developed in order to observe the thermo-mechanical
   properties of the new filaments. The acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS) thermoplastic was mixed with copper and iron particles. The
   percent loading of the metal powder was varied to confirm the effects of
   metal particles on the thermo-mechanical properties of the filament,
   such as tensile strength and thermal conductivity. The printing
   parameters such as temperature and fill density were also varied to see
   the effects of the parameters on the tensile strength of the final
   product which was made with the FDM process. As a result of this study,
   it was confirmed that the tensile strength of the composites is
   decreased by increasing the loading of metal particles. Additionally,
   the thermal conductivity of the metal/polymer composite filament was
   improved by increasing the metal content. It is believed that the
   metal/polymer filament could be used to print metal and large-scale
   3-dimensional (3D) structures without any distortion by the thermal
   expansion of thermoplastics. The material could also be used in 3D

Title = {{Relationship between long-range diffusion and diffusion in the ZIF-8 and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{477}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR is applied to resolve different modes of
   ethene self diffusion inside a mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) consisting of
   ZIF-8 particles embedded in 6FDA-DAM polymer: (i) diffusion inside the
   ZIF-8 particles, (ii) diffusion inside the surrounding polymer matrix,
   and (iii) diffusion under conditions of an exchange between the
   particles and the polymer over length scales smaller than and comparable
   with the membrane thickness. This resolution is achieved using C-13 PFG
   NMR studies at a high magnetic field of 17.6 T and large magnetic held
   gradients up to 30 T/m. C-13 PFG NMR was also applied to measure ethene
   diffusion in the constituent components used in the MMM formation: a bed
   of ZIP-8 particles and a pure 6FDA-DAM polymer. It is shown that the
   comparison of all the measured diffusion data elucidates details of
   sorbate diffusion and diffusion mediated exchange dynamics between the
   ZIP-8 particles and the polymer in the MMM. An exchange model is applied
   to connect the long-range diffusivity measured for displacements larger
   than the size of ZIP-8 particles in the MMM with the diffusivities
   measured inside the ZIP-8 particles and the polymer. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{5-14}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Estuaries and coastal bays frequently receive anthropogenically sourced
   contaminants. Many of these contaminants (e.g. most metals) have low
   solubility and tend to sorb to sediment particles, so that sediment
   transport driven by fluid mechanics becomes an important part of the
   contaminant transport problem. The chosen strategy for mitigation of the
   contaminant(s) will depend on the potential for migration away from the
   affected region, or the build-up of concentrations within the receiving
   area if loading rate exceeds decay or transport rates, and the potential
   impact on environmental and human health both within and outside the
   receiving area.
   Two case studies are considered here in which data describing
   instantaneous contaminant concentrations in estuarine environments were
   acquired via field sampling. Both sites feature estuaries dominated by
   tidal forcing, with smaller, adjacent upland regions also impacted.
   Metals, particularly copper and lead, are the primary focus in each
   case. Contaminant transport processes, including diffusion, advection,
   and bioturbation, are treated together to develop analytical and
   numerical solutions for time-dependent contaminant concentrations using
   a spatially varying, time-dependent, effective diffusion coefficient
   that is influenced by local surface water flow speeds. Different
   initial, boundary, and loading conditions are considered to illustrate
   the relative importance of the various transport processes. Implications
   of future contaminant loading and sea level rise scenarios are
   demonstrated and discussed.}},

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-26}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Septic systems are designed for on-site treatment of wastewater, often
   for individual households with dependence on homeowner maintenance. They
   frequently become overloaded and fail, short-circuiting wastewater
   treatment within the tank, allowing untreated wastes into groundwater or
   surface water. Current methods for detection of such leaks rely on the
   use of inert dye and are often inadequate. The work described here
   included development and testing of bacteriophage-based tracking
   approaches to improve assessment of on-site sewage disposal systems and
   identification of leaks. The hypothesis is that a benign bacteriophage
   can be used to detect chronically failing septic systems with greater
   sensitivity and longevity than inert dye technology. Testing was
   conducted in both open waterway and coastal groundwater systems subject
   to astronomical tidal forcing. Results in open (surface) water
   demonstrated correlation between dye and phage presence initially, but
   the phage was detectable at greater distances and longer durations than
   the dye. Phage detection in groundwater did not correlate with dye
   presence, and revealed that phage moves more quickly through soils than
   dye. Details of the development, testing, and deployment of the
   bacteriophage tracer are provided, illuminating both the pros and cons
   of the approach. The ultimate advantage is that the use of a sentinel
   bacteriophage improves detectability of failing septic systems in
   coastal and other environments. This approach may thus be useful for
   establishing new science-based criteria for the installation of new
   septic systems in coastal areas.}},

Abstract = {{The combined effect of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and prolonged
   exposure to low temperature on nitrification was investigated. Ammonia
   oxidation at 22-24 degrees C by an enriched nitrifying culture was
   inhibited at increasing BAC concentrations and ceased at 15 mg BAC/L.
   The non-competitive inhibition coefficient was 1.5 +/- 0.9 mg BAC/L.
   Nitrification tests were conducted without and with BAC at 5 mg/L using
   an aerobic, mixed heterotrophic/nitrifying culture maintained at a
   temperature range of 24-10 degrees C. Maintaining this culture at 10
   degrees C for over one month in the absence of BAC, resulted in slower
   nitrification kinetics compared to those measured when the culture was
   first exposed to 10 degrees C. BAC was degraded by the heterotrophic
   population, but its degradation rate decreased significantly as the
   culture temperature decreased to 10 degrees C. These results confirm the
   negative impact of quaternary ammonium compounds on the nitrification
   process, which is further exacerbated by prolonged, low temperature
   conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A commercial naphthenic acids (NAs) mixture (TCI Chemicals) and five
   model NA compounds were ozonated in a semibatch mode. Ozonation of 25
   and 35 mg/L NA mixture followed pseudo first-order kinetics (k(obs) =
   0.11 +/- 0.008 min(-1); r(2) = 0.989) with a residual NAs concentration
   of about 5 mg/L. Ozone reacted preferentially with NAs of higher
   cyclicity and molecular weight and decreased both cyclicity and the
   acute Microtox (R) toxicity by 3.3-fold. The ozone reactivity with
   acyclic and monocyclic model NAs varied and depended on other structural
   features, such as branching and the presence of tertiary or quaternary
   carbons. Batch aerobic degradation of unozonated NA mixture using a
   NA-enriched culture resulted in 83\% NA removal and a 6.7-fold decrease
   in toxicity, whereas a combination of ozonation-biodegradation resulted
   in 89\% NA removal and a 15-fold decrease in toxicity. Thus, ozonation
   of NA-bearing waste streams coupled with biodegradation are effective

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Understanding sub-lethal effects of nanomaterial may be particularly
   important to determining ecosystem responses as current levels of
   nanomaterial release are low compared to levels projected for the
   future. In this work, the sub-lethal effects of water stable,
   nanocrystalline fullerenes as C-60 (termed nC(60)) were studied on
   Scenedesmus obliquus, a globally distributed phytoplankton. Sub-lethal
   concentration for Scenedesmus obliquus was firstly determined as 0.09 mg
   L-1 using the standard 72 h exposure tests (OECD Guideline 201).
   Subsequent sub-lethal experiment of nC(60) on the Scenedesmus obliquus
   was carried out for 60 d and focused on the photosynthesis processes.
   The results demonstrate that upon sub-lethal exposure, the
   photosynthetic products of polysaccharide, soluble protein and total
   lipid were decreased with exposure time. The photosynthetic pigments of
   chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were negatively impacted. Further
   investigations indicate that the decrements in photosynthetic products
   and pigments were mainly due to the algal Mg2+ decrement (by 40\%) at
   the sub-lethal concentration (0.09 mg L-1) of nC(60). The decrement in
   Mg2+ of Scenedesmus obliquus was due to the inhibition of Mg2+-ATPase
   activity caused by nC(60). Sum up, these results not only describe the
   sub-lethal effects but also provide the probably mechanism for
   sub-lethal effects of nC(60) on exposed Scenedesmus obliquus. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The problem of graph matching (GM) in general is nondeterministic
   polynomial-complete and many approximate pairwise matching techniques
   have been proposed. For a general setting in real applications, it
   typically requires to find the consistent matching across a batch of

   propagation along the pairwise matching sequence, and the sequences
   generated in different pairwise matching orders can lead to
   contradictory solutions. Motivated by devising a robust and consistent
   multiple-GM model, we propose a unified alternating optimization
   framework for multi-GM. In addition, we define and use two metrics
   related to graphwise and pairwise consistencies. The former is used to
   find an appropriate reference graph, which induces a set of basis
   variables and launches the iteration procedure. The latter defines the
   order in which the considered graphs in the iterations are manipulated.
   We show two embodiments under the proposed framework that can cope with
   the nonfactorized and factorized affinity matrix, respectively. Our
   multi-GM model has two major characters: 1) the affinity information
   across multiple graphs are explored in each iteration by fixing part of
   the matching variables via a consistency-driven mechanism and 2) the
   framework is flexible to incorporate various existing pairwise GM
   solvers in an out-of-box fashion, and also can proceed with the output
   of other multi-GM methods. The experimental results on both synthetic
   data and real images empirically show that the proposed framework
   performs competitively with the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), with yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
   as electrolyte, composite of strontium-doped lanthanum manganate (LSM)
   and YSZ as cathode, and cermet of silver and gadolinium-doped ceria
   (GDC) as anode, are prepared and tested with 5wt\% Fe-loaded activated
   carbon as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. It is found that electricity
   and CO gas can be cogenerated in the direct carbon SOFCs through the
   electrochemical oxidation of CO and the Boudouard reaction. The gas
   electricity cogeneration performances are investigated by taking the
   operating time of the DC-SOFCs as a measure of rate decrease of the
   Boudouard reaction. Three single cells and a two-cell-stack are tested
   and characterized in terms of electrical power output, CO production
   rate, electrical conversion efficiency, and overall conversion
   efficiency. It turns out that a rapid rate of the Boudouard reaction is
   necessary for getting high electrical power and CO production. Taking
   the emitted CO as part of the power output, an overall efficiency of
   76.5\% for the single cell, and of 72.5\% for the stack, is obtained.

Abstract = {{Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the leading causes of
   morbidity and morality in orthotopic heart transplant (HTx) patients.
   While disturbed flow patterns have been linked to the spatial
   localization of atherosclerosis, the role of hemodynamics in CAV
   development has not been examined. HTx patients (n = 5) requiring
   percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a focal, epicardial lesion
   were studied. Angiographic images were retrospectively obtained from
   baseline (i.e., in the presence of no observed disease) and follow-up
   catheterizations (i.e., at the time of PCI; 12.4 +/- 2.6 years
   post-HTx). Patient-specific computational models were created from
   baseline images. Computational fluid dynamic techniques were employed to
   quantify the hemodynamic environment, which was expressed as normalized
   time-averaged WSS (TAWSS(norm); measure of temporal WSS magnitude) and
   normalized WSS angle deviation (WSSAD(norm); measure of instantaneous
   WSS vector oscillation) values. Baseline hemodynamic and follow-up
   angiographic data were co-registered to investigate the association
   between WSS and subsequent occlusive CAV lesion location. Results
   indicate a high degree of co-localization between baseline low WSS data
   and followup occlusive CAV lesion. Local minima in TAWSS(norm) were
   located 2.5 +/- 0.6 mm from the site of PCI. Furthermore, local maxima
   in WSSAD(norm) were located 3.9 +/- 0.7 mm from the site of PCI. In 3
   patients, the occlusive lesion formed in a region that was subjected to
   both low and oscillatory WSS at baseline. There was discernable spatial
   co-localization between baseline disturbed flow patterns and follow-up
   CAV lesions requiring PCI. These results suggest a role of fluid
   mechanics in the development of focal, flow-limiting CAV lesions.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation demonstrates the utility of image-based computational
   models in portal venous hemodynamics. The long-term objective is to
   develop methodologies based upon noninvasive imaging and hemodynamic
   computational models for blood flow in major vessels of the liver that
   will significantly augment and improve current practices in clinical
   care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) were used to investigate liver hemodynamics. MRI data were
   obtained in 7 healthy subjects and 4 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis,
   and computational models were developed and validated for two healthy
   subjects and two patients. Additional simulations of post-prandial
   hemodynamics and portal hypertension were completed. The MRI studies
   identified several new parameters (portal vein V-avg/total liver volume,
   V-var, splenic vein flow rate per total liver volume, and \% splenic
   flow/portal vein flow) that offer statistical differentiation between
   healthy subjects and patients with liver disease. Computational models
   were used to calculate the contribution of blood supply to the right and
   left lobes of the liver derived from the superior mesenteric vein
   (greater in healthy subjects vs. patients); and simulate post-prandial
   conditions and progressive portal hypertension. CFD offers a tool to
   test hypotheses without the acquisition of additional data and elucidate
   hemodynamic effects as disease progresses. In addition, several new MRI
   derived parameters have been identified as having promise to distinguish
   between healthy and patient groups and, potentially, to monitor disease
   progression.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces the feasibility of a flue gas energy recovery
   system that applies recovered waste energy to the proposed energy
   recovery radiant-heated slab system (ERRHSS). Through application of a
   runaround coil system to a 32.2 kW indirectly fired natural gas
   residential furnace, energy was transferred outdoors to melt snow on a
   radiant-heated slab by way of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) tubing and
   a small circulation pump. A full-scale model was constructed and its
   overall performance resulted in an adequate heat supply to melt the snow
   from a 1: 8333: 05-m (10 x 6-ft) concrete slab. Testing was completed
   successfully during normal operation of the furnace, assuming normal
   cycling of a nonprogrammable thermostat. The operating cost associated
   with the radiant snow-melting system was estimated to be less than the
   costs of traditional snow-melting systems on the market. The operating
   cost associated with the energy recovery snow-melting system was
   determined to be a fraction of the cost associated with a traditional
   gas-fired hydronic system and an electric snow-melting system. The
   ERRHSS provides a useful application for recycling waste heat to improve
   building energy efficiency while reducing the homeowner's expense for
   space heating or snow removal services. (C) 2014 American Society of

   transmission coefficient of Rayleigh surface waves is measured for three
   notches with different depths (0.5, 1, and 2 cm). Then, the relationship
   between the transmission coefficient and the normalized notch depth is
   experimentally reconstructed and compared with analytical and numerical
   results. It is demonstrated that the proposed fully non-contact

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of
   knowledge of second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements, a subset of
   nonlinear ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques. These SHG
   techniques exploit the material nonlinearity of metals in order to
   measure the acoustic nonlinearity parameter, beta. In these
   measurements, a second harmonic wave is generated from a propagating
   monochromatic elastic wave, due to the anharmonicity of the crystal
   lattice, as well as the presence of microstructural features such as
   dislocations and precipitates. This article provides a summary of models
   that relate the different microstructural contributions to beta, and
   provides details of the different SHG measurement and analysis
   techniques available, focusing on longitudinal and Rayleigh wave
   methods. The main focus of this paper is a critical review of the
   literature that utilizes these SHG methods for the nondestructive
   evaluation of plasticity, fatigue, thermal aging, creep, and radiation

Title = {{A tool for measuring and visualizing connectivity of transit stop, route

Abstract = {{Agencies at the federal, state and local level are aiming to enhance the
   public transportation system (PTS) as one alternative to alleviate
   congestion and to cater to the needs of captive riders. To effectively
   act as a viable alternative transportation mode, the system must be
   highly efficient. One way to measure efficiency of the PTS is
   connectivity. In a multimodal transportation system, transit is a key
   component. Transit connectivity is relatively complex to calculate, as
   one has to consider fares, schedule, capacity, frequency and other
   features of the system at large. Thus, assessing transit connectivity
   requires a systematic approach using many diverse parameters involved in
   real-world service provision. In this paper, we use a graph theoretic
   approach to evaluate transit connectivity at various levels of service
   and for various components of transit, such as nodes, lines, and
   transfer centers in a multimodal transportation system. Further, we
   provide a platform for computing connectivity over large-scale
   applications, using visualization to communicate results in the context
   of their geography and to facilitate public transit decision-making. The
   proposed framework is then applied to a comprehensive transit network in
   the Washington-Baltimore region. Underpinning the visualization, we
   introduce a novel spatial data architecture and Web-based interface
   designed with free and open source libraries and crowd-sourced
   contextual data, accessible on various platforms such as mobile phones,
   tablets and personal computers. The proposed methodology is a useful
   tool for both riders and decision-makers in assessing transit
   connectivity in a multimodal transit network in a number of ways such as
   the identification of under-served transit areas, prioritization and
   allocation of funds to locations for improving transit service.}},

Abstract = {{Assembling nanoparticles into one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures with
   precisely controlled size and shape renders the exploration of new
   properties and construction of 1D miniaturized devices possible. The
   physical properties of such nanostructures depend heavily on the size,
   chemical composition, and surface chemistry of nanoparticle
   constituents, as well as the close proximity of adjacent nanoparticles
   within the 1D nanostructure. Chemical synthesis provides an intriguing
   alternative means of creating 1D nanostructures composed of
   self-assembled nanoparticles in terms of material diversity, size
   controllability, shape regularity, and low-cost production. However,
   this is an area where progress has been slower. We report an
   unconventional yet general strategy to craft an exciting variety of 1D
   nanonecklace-like nanostructures comprising uniform functional nanodiscs
   periodically assembled along a stretched flexible polymer chain by
   capitalizing on judiciously designed amphiphilic worm-like diblock
   copolymers as nanoreactors. These nanostructures can be regarded as
   organic-inorganic shish-kebabs, in which nanodisc kebabs are
   periodically situated on a stretched polymer shish. Simulations based on
   self-consistent field theory reveal that the formation of
   organic-inorganic shish-kebabs is guided by the self-assembled elongated
   star-like diblock copolymer constituents constrained on the highly
   stretched polymer chain.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{147-165}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The load-carrying capacity of composite structures under water-based
   impulsive loads is evaluated in relation to different core materials and
   load intensity. The analysis focuses on the role of core density and the
   effect of varying structural attributes and environmental conditions on
   deformation and failure mechanisms in monolithic as well as sandwich
   composites. The structures analyzed are simply supported planar
   composites with PVC foam cores and E-glass/vinylester facesheets. For
   the analysis carried out, the material properties of the sandwich cores
   are varied while the total mass is kept constant. The structures are
   subjected to impulsive loads of different intensities using a novel new
   projectile-impact-based facility called the Underwater Shock Loading
   Simulator (USLS). In-situ high-speed digital imaging and postmortem
   analysis are used to study the deformation and failure of individual
   components, focusing on the effects of loading intensities, failure
   modes and material heterogeneity. Depending on the loading rate, shear
   cracking and/or collapse are the primary failure modes of the polymeric
   foam cores. Core density and height also significantly influence the
   response and failure modes. On a per unit weight basis, structures with
   low density cores consistently outperform structures with high density
   cores because the former undergo smaller deflections, acquire lower
   velocities and transmit a smaller fraction of incident impulses. Scaling
   relations in the form of deflection and impulse transmitted as functions
   of core density and load intensity are obtained to provide guidance for
   structural design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{54-55}},
Pages = {{124-138}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical connections play a significant role in predicting dynamic
   characteristics of assembled structures. Therefore, equivalent dynamic
   models for joints are needed. Due to the complexity of joints, it is
   difficult to describe joint dynamics with analytical models. Reliable
   models are generally obtained using experimental measurements. In this
   paper an experimental identification method based on FRF decoupling and
   optimization algorithm is proposed for modeling joints. In the method
   the FRFs of two substructures connected with a joint are measured, while
   the FRFs of the substructures are obtained numerically or
   experimentally. Then the joint properties are calculated in terms of
   translational, rotational and cross-coupling stiffness and damping
   values by using FRF decoupling. In order to eliminate the numerical
   errors associated with matrix inversion an optimization algorithm is
   used to update the joint values obtained from FRF decoupling. The
   validity of the proposed method is demonstrated with experimental
   studies with bolted joints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Shaping amine-based solid CO2 adsorbents: Effects of pelletization

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{204}},

Abstract = {{Amine-based solid adsorbents are promising candidates for the separation
   of CO2 from dilute gas streams. Here we report the effect of
   pelletization pressure on the physical and chemical properties of an
   array of supported amine adsorbents, based on mesoporous silica and
   gamma-alumina supports. The virgin powders based on poly(ethyleneimine)
   (PEI) and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) functionalized oxides are
   pressed at 1000 and 5000 psig pressure to form self-supporting pellets
   and their physical and chemical properties are compared. No change in
   chemical structure of the adsorbents is observed after pelletization,
   though the porosity of each material changes to some degree. Of the
   three mesoporous supports examined in this study, the commercial porous
   silica is the most stable support for both class 1 and class 2
   adsorbents, whereas lab synthesized mesoporous SBA-15 silica and lab
   synthesized mesoporous gamma-alumina are found to be the least stable
   supports for class 1 and class 2 adsorbents, respectively. The CO2
   uptake results show a significant drop in equilibrium capacity for the
   pellets pressed at 5000 psig, regardless of the support used, while the
   1000 psig pellets retain their capacity and show comparable performance
   to their powder counterparts. CO2 breakthrough experiments suggest an
   increase in mass transfer resistance for the pellet samples as compared
   with virgin powders, resulting in the dispersion of the concentration
   fronts during CO2 breakthrough using a fixed bed. These findings suggest
   that shaping solid supported amine adsorbents into binderless pellets
   requires pressing the powders at low to moderate pressures to ensure
   that these materials retain their performance in processes that require
   pelletized samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon coated MnOx (MnOx@C) with various novel and complex 3D
   hierarchical architectures self-assembled from different building blocks
   were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method in
   glucose-mediated processes. The morphology modulation of MnOx@C could be
   easily realized simply by adjusting the amount of glucose added into the
   reaction system. The formation mechanisms for different hierarchical
   architectures were proposed on the basis of time-dependent experiments.
   An investigation on UV-visible absorption spectroscopy revealed that the
   as-synthesized MnOx@C expanded the light absorption from UV region to
   visible light region. Specifically, when 0.45 g of glucose was used, the
   samples (epsilon-MnO2-C-0.45 and MnO-C-0.45) obtained from different
   calcination process exhibited the semiconductor feature with a band gap
   of 1.9 eV and 1.84 eV, respectively. In addition, the carbon coating on
   MnOx provided good chemical protection for MnO, and greatly improved its
   photostability. The laser heating effect for epsilon-MnO2@C structures
   were also studied. The epsilon-MnO2@C structures could be stable at a
   high laser power of 1200 mu W, which suggested significantly enhanced
   photostability. When used for decolorization of methyl orange under
   visible light (lambda >= 420 nm), the MnOx@C structures exhibited much
   higher activities than pure MnOx. The decolorization rate for the
   optimum catalyst epsilon-MnO2-C-0.45 could reach above 90\% within 10
   min. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   cis-dihydrocarvone ratio increased following the order: 2-propanol <
   ethanol < methanol. The total selectivity to dihydrocarvone 62\% was
   achieved at a nearly complete carvone conversion (90\%) after 13 h in
   the case of methanol, with the trans- to cis-dihydrocarvone ratio being
   about 1.8. Based on the transition state theory a quantitative
   description of trans- to cis-dihydrocarvone ratio variations indifferent
   solvents was made. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Two-dimensional mesoscale simulations of shock response of dry sand}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Simulations were done to gain insight whether the shock response of dry
   sand at low stresses would vary with porosity and whether the effects of
   friction between grains under confinement could be extracted from the
   planar plate impact experimental data. The sand sample was modeled as
   grains separated by voids representing porosity. The simulation
   procedure coupled grain deformations with frictional sliding at grain
   boundaries. The shock response of dry sand varied considerably with
   porosity. The sample compacted through pore closure followed by
   inelastic pore collapse mechanisms affecting the inhomogeneous response
   and shock rise time. The sample attained final compaction in the shock
   state long after attaining peak longitudinal velocity/stress. The
   calculated shock Hugoniot for a sample of high (40\%) porosity was in
   agreement with experimental data. The U-s - U-p slopes for sand of 10\%
   and 20\% porosity were found to be negative. The calculated sigma H -
   rho(H) Hugoniot suggested that the two slopes would become positive at
   higher stresses in order to approach the solid Z-cut quartz Hugoniot at
   full compaction. High porosity sand may never exhibit negative slopes.
   It is concluded that the effects of friction between grains can be
   successfully extracted from a coupled experimental-computational
   approach. This requires measuring the velocity profile in the back
   buffer, elastic buffer material, and code capable of simulating
   frictional sliding between grains. The dispersion effect increased the
   slope of the velocity profile with propagation distance but did not
   result in a wave speed reduction or shock attenuation. This may be due
   to the small grain size and sample thickness as well as the absence of
   grain fragmentation in the present simulations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Classical simulations of noisy stabilizer circuits are often used to
   estimate the threshold of a quantum error-correcting code. Physical
   noise sources are efficiently approximated by random insertions of Pauli
   operators. For a single qubit, more accurate approximations that still
   allow for efficient simulation can be obtained by including Clifford
   operators and Pauli operators conditional on measurement. We examine the
   feasibility of employing these expanded error approximations to obtain
   better threshold estimates. We calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for
   the Steane {[}{[}7,1,3]] code for amplitude damping and dephasing along
   a non-Clifford axis. The expanded channels estimate the actual channel
   action more accurately than the Pauli channels before error correction.
   However, after error correction, the Pauli twirling approximation yields
   very accurate estimates of the performance of quantum error-correcting
   protocols in the presence of the actual noise channel.}},

Abstract = {{The dimers of pentamethyliridocene and ruthenium
   pentamethylcyclopentadienyl mesitylene, (IrCp{*}Cp)(2) and
   (RuCp{*}mes)(2), respectively, are shown here to be effective
   solution-processable reagents for lowering the work functions of
   electrode materials; this approach is compared to the use of
   solution-deposited films of ethoxylated poly(ethylenimine) (PEIE). The
   work functions of indium tin oxide (ITO), zinc oxide, and gold
   electrodes can be reduced to 3.3-3.4 eV by immersion in a toluene
   solution of (IrCp{*}Cp)(2); these values are similar to those that can
   be obtained by spin-coating a thin layer of PEIE onto the electrodes.
   The work-function reductions achieved using (IrCp{*}Cp)(2) are primarily
   attributable to the interface dipoles associated with the formation of
   submonolayers of IrCp{*}Cp+ cations on negatively charged substrates,
   which in turn result from redox reactions between the dimer and the
   electrode. The electrical properties of C-60 diodes with dimer-modified
   ITO cathodes are similar to those of analogous devices with
   PEIE-modified ITO cathodes.}},

Title = {{Generalized gas-solid adsorption modeling: Single-component equilibria}},
Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{388}},
Pages = {{169-181}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Over the last several decades, modeling of gas-solid adsorption at
   equilibrium has generally been accomplished through the use of isotherms
   such as the Freundlich, Langmuir, Toth, and other similar models. While
   these models are relatively easy to adapt for describing experimental
   data, their simplicity limits their generality to be used with many
   different sets of data. This limitation forces engineers and scientists
   to test each different model in order to evaluate which one can best
   describe their data. Additionally, the parameters of these models all
   have a different physical interpretation, which may have an effect on
   how they can be further extended into kinetic, thermodynamic, and/or
   mass transfer models for engineering applications. Therefore, it is
   paramount to adopt not only a more general isotherm model, but also a
   concise methodology to reliably optimize for and obtain the parameters
   of that model. A model of particular interest is the Generalized
   Statistical Thermodynamic Adsorption (GSTA) isotherm. The GSTA isotherm
   has enormous flexibility, which could potentially be used to describe a
   variety of different adsorption systems, but utilizing this model can be
   fairly difficult due to that flexibility. To circumvent this
   complication, a comprehensive methodology and computer code has been
   developed that can perform a full equilibrium analysis of adsorption
   data for any gas-solid system using the GSTA model. The code has been
   developed in C/C++ and utilizes a Levenberg-Marquardfs algorithm to
   handle the nonlinear optimization of the model parameters. Since the
   GSTA model has an adjustable number of parameters, the code iteratively
   goes through all number of plausible parameters for each data set and
   then returns the best solution based on a set of scrutiny criteria. Data
   sets at different temperatures are analyzed serially and then linear
   correlations with temperature are made for the parameters of the model.
   The end result is a full set of optimal GSTA parameters, both
   dimensional and non-dimensional, as well as the corresponding
   thermodynamic parameters necessary to predict the behavior of the system
   at temperatures for which data were not available. It will be shown that
   this code, utilizing the GSTA model, was able to describe a wide variety
   of gas-solid adsorption systems at equilibrium. Additionally, a physical
   interpretation of these results will be provided, as well as an
   alternate derivation of the GSTA model, which intends to reaffirm the
   physical meaning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water, because of its fundamental role in biology, geology, and many
   industrial applications and its anomalous behavior compared to that of
   simple fluids, continues to fascinate and attract extensive scientific
   interest. Building on previous studies of water in contact with
   different surfaces, in this study, we report results obtained from
   molecular dynamics simulations of water near hydrophilic and hydrophobic
   interfaces in the presence of nonionic and ionic amphiphilic molecules,
   hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E6) and sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS). We elucidate how these surfactants affect the packing (i.e.,
   density profiles) and orientation of interfacial water. The results
   highlight the interplay of both surfactant charges and the substrate
   charge distribution predominantly with respect to the orientation of
   water molecules, up to distances longer than those expected based on
   simulation results on flat solid surfaces. We also quantify the dynamics
   of interfacial water molecules by computing the residence probability
   for water in contact with various substrates. We compare our results to
   those previously obtained for interfacial water on silica and graphite
   and also with experimental sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy
   results at the air-water interface in the presence of surfactants. Our
   analysis could be useful for a better understanding of interfacial water
   not only near solid substrates but also near self-assembled/aggregated
   molecules at a variety of interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{An anhydrous synthesis of aminosilica materials from alkyl
   halide-functionalized mesoporous SBA-15 silica by post-grafting
   amination is introduced for applications in CO2 adsorption, cooperative
   catalysis, and N-15 solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The synthesis is
   demonstrated to convert terminal alkyl halide-functionalized silica
   materials containing Cl, Br, and I to primary alkylamines using
   anhydrous ammonia in a high-pressure reactor. The benefits of the
   post-grafting amination procedure include (i) use of anhydrous
   isotopically labeled ammonia, (NH3)-N-15, to create aminosilica
   materials that can be investigated using N-15 solid-state NMR to
   elucidate potential intermediates and surface species in CO2 adsorption
   processes and catalysis, (ii) similar CO2 uptake in experiments
   extracting CO2 from dry simulated air experiments, and (iii) improved
   activity in acid-base bifunctional catalysis compared to traditional
   amine-grafted materials. The effects of the type of halide, the initial
   halide loading, and the total reaction time on the conversion of the
   halides to primary amines are explored. Physical and chemical
   characterizations of the materials show that the textural properties of
   the silica are unaffected by the reaction conditions and that
   quantitative conversion to primary amines is achieved even at short
   reaction times and high initial alkyl halide loadings. Additionally,
   preliminary N-15 solid-state NMR experiments indicate formation of
   nitrogen-containing species and demonstrate that the synthesis can be
   used to create materials useful for investigating surface species by NMR
   spectroscopy. The differences between the materials prepared via
   post-grafting amination vs traditional aminosilane grafting are
   attributed to the slightly increased spacing of the amines synthesized
   by amination because the alkylhalosilanes are initially better spaced on
   the silica surface after grafting, whereas the aminosilanes likely
   cluster to a greater extent when grafted on the silica surface. A slight
   increase in amine spacing allows for more effective amine-silanol
   interactions in cooperative catalysis without reducing the amine
   efficiency in CO2 uptake under the conditions used here.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of hydrogen production by variable volume

Abstract = {{A novel dynamically-controlled membrane batch reactor, which combines
   the variable volume operation of CHAMP (CO2/H-2 Active Membrane Piston)
   with the direct injection of liquid fuel of DDIR (Direct Droplet
   Impingement Reactor) for enhanced power density, is demonstrated and
   experimentally characterized in this study. A laboratory-scale
   CHAMPDDIR, consisting of a variable volume piston-cylinder reactor
   chamber and an actively-controlled micro injector for liquid fuel
   atomization, is used with a Pd-Ag foil membrane and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3
   catalyst to steam reform methanol for hydrogen generation. Two modes of
   CHAMP-DDIR operation, pulse-modulated fuel injection and batch reaction
   with dynamically-adjusted reactor volume, were investigated, and their
   performance was quantified using metrics such as hydrogen yield and
   volumetric power density, and compared with those for a baseline
   operation (single fuel injection with fixed reactor volume). The
   experimental results showed that the residence time for the same
   hydrogen yield can be reduced by compressing the reactor volume during
   the conversion cycle. The residence time reduction was primarily as a
   result of higher hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor chamber and
   thus higher rates of hydrogen permeation. In addition, pulse-modulated
   fuel injection experiments revealed that a significant reduction in
   required reactor volume can be achieved with multi-shot split fuel
   introduction. Both the reduction in required cycle time and the
   reduction in required reactor volume increase the volumetric power
   density of CHAMP-DDIR. The demonstrated power density enhancement
   achieved through the dynamic compression of reactor volume was 17\%, and
   the enhancement achieved through time-modulated fuel introduction was
   38\% (for 85\% hydrogen yield efficiency and under the constraints of
   the same maximum operating pressure and total amount of fuel). Copyright

Abstract = {{The dynamic CO2 sorption performance of polymer/silica supported
   polyethylenimine hollow fiber sorbents (CA-S-PEI), focusing on heat and
   mass transport effects, is investigated experimentally and
   computationally during sorption of CO2 from simulated, dry flue gases.
   The effect of the nonisothermality on the sorption performance is
   investigated by varying the module materials of construction. The heat
   effects are minimized by using a heat conductive module case with a
   diameter of 0.25 in., and, accordingly, the breakthrough capacities are
   increased by 30\% over a similar module constructed from less conductive
   components, thereby improving fiber sorbents utilization efficiency. The
   sorption kinetics in CA-S-PEI hollow fiber sorbents are investigated in
   terms of flow rates, module packing fraction, module length, and silica
   particle size. A mathematical model developed previously is successfully
   utilized to predict various contributions to the overall mass transfer
   resistance. In fiber sorbents where the amine loading is high, such as
   those employed here, the sorption process is found to be controlled by
   intraparticle mass transfer resistances. Unlike fiber sorbents based on
   physisorbents, the external gas diffusion resistance has minimal effects
   on the breakthrough capacities, as evidenced with the negligible effects
   of the module packing fraction on the sorption capacities. Sorption
   capacities are found to increase with the fiber module length as a
   result of self-sharpening effects. The increase of particle size
   increases the mass transfer resistance of the fiber sorbents as
   illustrated by the more diffuse CO2 breakthrough fronts in fiber modules
   containing bigger silica particles. The capacities in fiber sorbents
   with the largest silica particles exhibit the lowest sorption capacity,
   as expected.}},

Title = {{OVCAR-3 Spheroid-Derived Cells Display Distinct Metabolic Profiles}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Recently, multicellular spheroids were isolated from a well-established
   epithelial ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-3, and were propagated in
   vitro. These spheroid-derived cells displayed numerous hallmarks of
   cancer stem cells, which are chemo- and radioresistant cells thought to
   be a significant cause of cancer recurrence and resultant mortality.
   Gene set enrichment analysis of expression data from the OVCAR-3 cells
   and the spheroid-derived putative cancer stem cells identified several
   metabolic pathways enriched in differentially expressed genes. Before
   this, there had been little previous knowledge or investigation of
   systems-scale metabolic differences between cancer cells and cancer stem
   cells, and no knowledge of such differences in ovarian cancer stem
   cells.
   Methods
   To determine if there were substantial metabolic changes corresponding
   with these transcriptional differences, we used two-dimensional gas
   chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to measure the metabolite
   profiles of the two cell lines.
   Results
   These two cell lines exhibited significant metabolic differences in both
   intracellular and extracellular metabolite measurements. Principal
   components analysis, an unsupervised dimensional reduction technique,
   showed complete separation between the two cell types based on their
   metabolite profiles. Pathway analysis of intracellular metabolomics data
   revealed close overlap with metabolic pathways identified from gene
   expression data, with four out of six pathways found enriched in
   gene-level analysis also enriched in metabolitelevel analysis. Some of
   those pathways contained multiple metabolites that were individually
   statistically significantly different between the two cell lines, with
   one of the most broadly and consistently different pathways, arginine
   and proline metabolism, suggesting an interesting hypothesis about
   cancerous and stem-like metabolic phenotypes in this pair of cell lines.
   Conclusions
   Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that metabolism in an ovarian
   cancer stem cell line is distinct from that of more differentiated
   isogenic cancer cells, supporting the potential importance of metabolism
   in the differences between cancer cells and cancer stem cells.}},

Abstract = {{The excellent photophysical properties of C-60 fullerenes have spurred
   much research on their application to aqueous systems for biological and
   environmental applications. Spontaneous aggregation of C-60 in water and
   the consequent diminution of photoactivity present a significant
   challenge to aqueous applications. The mechanisms driving the reduction
   of photoactivity in fullerene aggregates and the effects of
   functionalization on these processes, however, are not well understood.
   Here, we take a closer look at the molecular phenomena of functionalized
   fullerene interactions in water utilizing simulation and experimental
   tools. Molecular dynamic simulations were performed to investigate
   time-evolved molecular interactions in systems containing fullerenes
   with water, oxygen, and/or neighboring fullerene molecules, complimented
   by physical and chemical characterizations of the fullerenes pre- and
   postaggregation. Aggregates with widely different photoactivities
   exhibit similar fullerenewater interactions as well as surface and
   aggregation characteristics. Photoactive fullerene aggregates had weaker
   fullerenefullerene and fullereneO(2) interactions, suggesting the
   importance of molecular interactions in the sensitization route.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional Volatility Basis Sets
   in Simulating the Aging of Secondary Organic Aerosol with Smog-Chamber
   Experiments}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the one-dimensional volatility basis set (1D-VBS) and
   two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) in simulating the aging of
   SOA derived from toluene and a-pinene against smog-chamber experiments.
   If we simulate the first-generation products with empirical chamber fits
   and the subsequent aging chemistry with a 1D-VBS or a 2D-VBS, the models
   mostly overestimate the SOA concentrations in the toluene oxidation
   experiments. This is because the empirical chamber fits include both
   first-generation oxidation and aging; simulating aging in addition to
   this results in double counting of the initial aging effects. If the
   first-generation oxidation is treated explicitly, the base-case 2D-VBS
   underestimates the SOA concentrations and O:C increase of the toluene
   oxidation experiments; it generally underestimates the SOA
   concentrations and overestimates the O:C increase of the a-pinene
   experiments. With the first-generation oxidation treated explicitly, we
   could modify the 2D-VBS configuration individually for toluene and
   alpha-pinene to achieve good model-measurement agreement. However, we
   are unable to simulate the oxidation of both toluene and a-pinene with
   the same 2D-VBS configuration. We suggest that future models should
   implement parallel layers for anthropogenic (aromatic) and biogenic
   precursors, and that more modeling studies and laboratory research be
   done to optimize the best-guess parameters for each layer.}},

   nanowires}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Compared to their crystalline counterparts, nanowires made of metallic
   glass have not only superb properties but also remarkable processing
   ability. They can be processed easily and cheaply like plastics via a
   wide range of methods. To date, the underlying mechanisms of how these
   different processing routes affect the wires' properties as well as the
   atomic structure remains largely unknown. Here, by using atomistic
   modeling, we show that different processing methods can greatly
   influence the mechanical properties. The nanowires made via focused ion
   beam milling and embossing exhibit higher strength but localized plastic
   deformation, whereas that made by casting from liquid shows excellent
   ductility with homogeneous deformation but reduced strength. The
   different responses are reflected sensitively in the underlying atomic
   structure and packing density, some of which have been observed
   experimentally. The presence of the gradient of alloy concentration and
   surface effect will be discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Fragility curves for non-ductile reinforced concrete frames that exhibit
   different component response mechanisms}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{127-143}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Around the world, a large percentage of buildings in regions of high
   seismicity are older, non-ductile reinforced concrete. To assess the
   risk posed by these buildings, fragility functions are required to
   define the likelihood that these buildings will sustain damage and
   collapse under earthquake loading. This paper presents the initial phase
   of a research effort to develop fragility functions for non-ductile
   concrete frames using numerical simulation; the research presented in
   this paper focuses on development of the numerical model and application
   of the model to develop fragility functions for a prototype non-ductile
   concrete frame. To enable numerical simulation of concrete frame
   buildings, response models for beam column joints and columns are
   developed to provide (1) appropriate simulation of component response
   and, thereby, reliable assessment of risk and (2) computational
   efficiency and robustness. These new models are developed using existing
   experimental data, build on response models proposed by others, and
   employ component and material models available in the OpenSees analysis
   platform (http://opensees.berkeley.edu). A new beam column joint model
   combines a new expression for joint strength and newly developed cyclic
   response parameters; a new column response model includes a new
   shear-strength model and newly developed cyclic response parameters.
   Numerical models of a prototype non-ductile concrete frame are developed
   that include simulation of one or more of the following characteristics:
   (1) rigid beam column joint, (2) nonlinear joint shear response, (3)
   nonlinear joint shear and bond slip response, and (4) column shear
   failure. Dynamic analyses are performed using these frame models and a
   suite of ground motions; analysis results are used to develop fragility
   curves. Fragility curves quantify the vulnerability of the frame and
   provide understanding of the impact of different component failure
   mechanisms on frame vulnerability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Patch clamping is a gold-standard electrophysiology technique that has
   the temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio capable of reporting
   single ion channel currents, as well as electrical activity of excitable
   single cells. Despite its usefulness and decades of development, the
   amplifiers required for patch clamping are expensive and bulky. This has
   limited the scalability and throughput of patch clamping for single-ion
   channel and single-cell analyses. In this work, we have developed a
   custom patch-clamp amplifier microchip that can be fabricated using
   standard commercial silicon processes capable of performing both
   voltage- and current-clamp measurements. A key innovation is the use of
   nonlinear feedback elements in the voltage-clamp amplifier circuit to
   convert measured currents into logarithmically encoded voltages, thereby
   eliminating the need for large high-valued resistors, a factor that has
   limited previous attempts at integration. Benchtop characterization of
   the chip shows low levels of current noise {[}1.1 pA root mean square
   (rms) over 5 kHz] during voltage-clamp measurements and low levels of
   voltage noise (8.2 mu V rms over 10 kHz) during current-clamp
   measurements. We demonstrate the ability of the chip to perform both
   current- and voltage-clamp measurement in vitro in HEK293FT cells and
   cultured neurons. We also demonstrate its ability to perform in vivo
   recordings as part of a robotic patch-clamping system. The performance
   of the patch-clamp amplifier microchip compares favorably with much
   larger commercial instrumentation, enabling benchtop commoditization,
   miniaturization, and scalable patch-clamp instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are inherently advantageous in achieving designable
   auxeticity since their Poisson' ratios are determined by the geometry of
   their unit cells. A family of auxetic metamaterials was created by
   computer-aided design (CAD) and dual-material three-dimensional (3D)
   printing. The effects of material selections and stiff material fraction
   on the Poisson's ratio, equivalent Young's Modulus, and maximum volume
   reduction were investigated. The results from finite element analysis
   (FEA) and mechanical testing indicated that the auxeticity and
   mechanical properties of this dual-material auxetic metamaterial (DMAM)
   are distinctly different from those of traditional single-material
   auxetic metamaterials (SMAMs). The interesting properties of DMAMs could
   be valuable to various engineering applications such as smart materials,

Abstract = {{Self-assembly of conjugated organic semiconductors into ordered, larger
   scale entities is a critical process to achieve efficient charge
   transport at the nano-through macro-scales, and various methodologies
   aimed at enhancing molecular ordering have been introduced. However,
   mechanistic understanding is limited. Here, a mechanistic elucidation of
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) molecular self-assembly is proposed based
   on experimental demonstration of controlled, solution-based P3HT
   self-assembly into rod-like polycrystalline nanostructures. The
   synergistic combination of nonsolvent addition and ultrasonication
   facilitates rod-like P3HT nanostructure formation in solution.
   Importantly, through sequential application of both treatments,
   nanostructure length can be easily modulated, and the assembly process
   is shown to follow a simple 2-step crystallization model, which depends
   upon nucleation followed by growth. Through arrays of experimental
   results, the validity of 2-step crystallization is confirmed and is
   proposed as a comprehensive platform to understand self-assembly
   processes of conjugated polymers into larger, ordered mesoscale
   entities.}},

Abstract = {{Well-ordered three-dimensional Cu architectures serving as
   low-resistance current collectors for supercapacitor applications are
   fabricated by combining microfabrication and electrochemical techniques.
   These techniques enable the realization of electrodes with precisely
   controlled characteristic dimensions, including the surface area,
   thickness of the active material, and interlayer spacing. Highly
   laminated Cu structures are formed by through-mold electrodeposition of
   alternating Ni and Cu layers followed by selective electrochemical
   removal of Ni layers. Underpotential deposition is utilized to precisely
   measure the electrochemically accessible surface area of the resultant
   Cu structure. A conformal, thin layer of nickel hydroxide is
   electrodeposited onto the Cu backbone, forming the supercapacitor
   electrode. The resulting electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance
   value of 733Fg(-1). In cycle testing, the electrodes deliver 94\% of
   their capacitance after over 1000 cycles. The supercapacitor is also
   shown to deliver 69\% of its 5mVs(-1) capacity at rates as high as
   25mVs(-1). These results illustrate the benefits of using well-ordered
   metal architectures as current collectors for advanced electrochemical
   energy storage applications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2636-2645}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Sound categorization is essential for auditory behaviors like acoustic
   communication, but its genesis within the auditory pathway is not well
   understood-especially for learned natural categories like vocalizations,
   which often share overlapping acoustic features that must be
   distinguished (e.g., speech). We use electrophysiological mapping and
   single-unit recordings in mice to investigate how representations of
   natural vocal categories within core auditory cortex are modulated when
   one category acquires enhanced behavioral relevance. Taking advantage of
   a maternal mouse model of acoustic communication, we found no long-term
   auditory cortical map expansion to represent a behaviorally relevant pup
   vocalization category-contrary to expectations from the cortical
   plasticity literature on conditioning with pure tones. Instead, we
   observed plasticity that improved the separation between acoustically
   similar pup and adult vocalization categories among a physiologically
   defined subset of late-onset, putative pyramidal neurons, but not among
   putative interneurons. Additionally, a larger proportion of these
   putative pyramidal neurons in maternal animals compared with nonmaternal
   animals responded to the individual pup call exemplars having
   combinations of acoustic features most typical of that category.
   Together, these data suggest that higher-order representations of
   acoustic categories arise from a subset of core auditory cortical
   pyramidal neurons that become biased toward the combination of acoustic
   features statistically predictive of membership to a behaviorally
   relevant sound category.}},

   plasticization resistance for natural gas separation}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{121-129}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{A series of cross-linkable membrane materials based on the 6FDA-DAM:DABA
   (3:2) polyimide with enhanced transport plasticization resistance were
   synthesized to separate CO2 from CH4. Glycidol was used as a
   cross-linking agent to modify 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2) efficiently and form a
   transesterification reaction-based cross-linking. The conversion was
   calculated by solution H-1 NMR. These materials were also characterized
   via density, glass transition temperature, permeation, and sorption
   measurements. Pure (CO2, CH4) and mixed gas (CO2/CH4) permeation was
   studied on dense films of these materials up to 700 psia (1000 psia) for
   pure CO2 (50\%:50\% CO2:CH4 mixed gas) feed. Compared to the
   6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2) membrane, CO2-induced plasticization resistance for
   cross-linked membranes was enhanced in aggressive feed streams. Under
   CO2 feed conditions at 35 degrees C, plasticization for the 41\%
   glycidol-modified cross-linked membrane was not observed up to
   approximately 450 psia. Glycidol-induced cross-linking offers an
   excellent balance of selectivity, permeability, and plasticization
   resistance. The glycidol-modified 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2) is competitive
   with the earlier reported 1,3-propanediol modified materials. Possible
   issues such as resistance to contaminants may be final determinants in
   choice of approach; however, this topic was beyond the scope of the
   current study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A parallel localization scheme is presented to enable solution transfers
   between unstructured grids. The scheme relies on neighbor walks to
   reduce the number of candidate elements that are visited to find the
   enclosing element. An advancing front method efficiently allows a subset
   of nodes to efficiently sweep through the grid, progressively reducing
   search spaces. The algorithm is parallelized permitting solution
   transfers over arbitrary grid decompositions. A hierarchical
   localization process helps prevent the neighbor walk algorithm from
   failing when encountering the boundaries of a concave domain by
   localizing the boundaries before the interior of the domain is
   localized. Random selections of the next step interrupt cyclic loops
   that may occur during a neighbor walk. The complexity of the search
   algorithm is verified over parallel decompositions and is effectively
   independent of the number of partitions. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley

Title = {{Synchronization of pairwise-coupled, identical, relaxation oscillators
   based on metal-insulator phase transition devices: A model study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Computing with networks of synchronous oscillators has attracted
   wide-spread attention as novel materials and device topologies have
   enabled realization of compact, scalable and low-power coupled
   oscillatory systems. Of particular interest are compact and low-power
   relaxation oscillators that have been recently demonstrated using MIT
   (metal-insulator-transition) devices using properties of correlated
   oxides. Further the computational capability of pairwise coupled
   relaxation oscillators has also been shown to outperform traditional
   Boolean digital logic circuits. This paper presents an analysis of the
   dynamics and synchronization of a system of two such identical coupled
   relaxation oscillators implemented with MIT devices. We focus on two
   implementations of the oscillator: (a) a D-D configuration where
   complementary MIT devices (D) are connected in series to provide
   oscillations and (b) a D-R configuration where it is composed of a
   resistor (R) in series with a voltage-triggered state changing MIT
   device (D). The MIT device acts like a hysteresis resistor with
   different resistances in the two different states. The synchronization
   dynamics of such a system has been analyzed with purely charge based
   coupling using a resistive (R-C) and a capacitive (C-C) element in
   parallel. It is shown that in a D-D configuration symmetric, identical
   and capacitively coupled relaxation oscillator system synchronizes to an
   anti-phase locking state, whereas when coupled resistively the system
   locks in phase. Further, we demonstrate that for certain range of values
   of R-C and C-C, a bistable system is possible which can have potential
   applications in associative computing. In D-R configuration, we
   demonstrate the existence of rich dynamics including non-monotonic flows
   and complex phase relationship governed by the ratios of the coupling
   impedance. Finally, the developed theoretical formulations have been
   shown to explain experimentally measured waveforms of such pairwise
   coupled relaxation oscillators. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Temporal Evolution of Ischemic Lesions in Nonhuman Primates: A Diffusion
   and Perfusion MRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose
   Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion MRI were used to examine
   the spatiotemporal evolution of stroke lesions in adult macaques with
   ischemic occlusion.
   Methods
   Permanent MCA occlusion was induced with silk sutures through an
   interventional approach via the femoral artery in adult rhesus monkeys
   (n = 8, 10-21 years old). The stroke lesions were examined with
   high-resolution DWI and perfusion MRI, and T2-weighted imaging (T2W) on
   a clinical 3T scanner at 1-6, 48, and 96 hours post occlusion and
   validated with H\&E staining.
   Results
   The stroke infarct evolved via a natural logarithmic pattern with the
   mean infarct growth rate = 1.38 +/- 1.32 ml per logarithmic time scale
   (hours) (n = 7) in the hyperacute phase (1-6 hours). The mean infarct
   volume after 6 hours post occlusion was 3.6 +/- 2.8 ml (n = 7, by DWI)
   and increased to 3.9 +/- 2.9 ml (n = 5, by T2W) after 48 hours, and to
   4.7 +/- 2.2ml (n = 3, by T2W) after 96 hours post occlusion. The infarct
   volumes predicted by the natural logarithmic function were correlated
   significantly with the T2W-derived lesion volumes (n = 5, r = 0.92, p =
   0.01) at 48 hours post occlusion. The final infarct volumes derived from
   T2W were correlated significantly with those from H\&E staining (r =
   0.999, p < 0.0001, n = 4). In addition, the diffusion-perfusion mismatch
   was visible generally at 6 hours but nearly diminished at 48 hours post
   occlusion.
   Conclusion
   The infarct evolution follows a natural logarithmic pattern in the
   hyperacute phase of stroke. The logarithmic pattern of evolution could
   last up to 48 hours after stroke onset and may be used to predict the
   infarct volume growth during the acute phase of ischemic stroke. The
   nonhuman primate model, MRI protocols, and post data processing strategy
   may provide an excellent platform for characterizing the evolution of
   acute stroke lesion in mechanistic studies and therapeutic interventions
   of stroke disease.}},

Abstract = {{Post-transcriptional processing of mRNA transcripts plays a critical
   role in establishing the gene expression profile of a cell. Such
   processing events are mediated by a host of factors, including
   RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs. A number of critical cellular
   pathways are subject to regulation at multiple levels that allow
   fine-tuning of key biological responses. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4)
   is a tumor suppressor and an important modulator of mRNA translation
   that is regulated by a number of mechanisms, most notably as a target of
   the on comiR, miR-21. Here, we provide evidence for post-transcriptional
   regulation of PDCD4 by the RNA-binding proteins, HuR and TIA1.
   Complementary approaches reveal binding of both HuR and TIA1 to the
   PDCD4 transcript. Consistent with a model where RNA-binding proteins
   modulate the PDCD4 transcript, knockdown of HuR and/or TIA1 results in a
   significant decrease in steady-state PDCD4 mRNA and protein levels.
   However, fractionation experiments suggest that the mode of regulation
   of the PDCD4 transcript likely differs in the cytoplasm and the nucleus
   as the pool of PDCD4 mRNA present in the cytoplasm is more stable than
   the nuclear pool of PDCD4 transcript. We observe a competitive mode of
   binding between HuR and TIA1 on the PDCD4 transcript in the cytoplasm,
   suggesting that these two factors dynamically interact with one another
   as well as the PDCD4 transcript to maintain tight control of PDCD4
   levels. Overall, this study reveals an additional set of regulatory
   interactions that modulate the expression of PDCD4, a key pro-apoptotic
   factor, and also reveals new insights into how HuR and TIA1 functions
   are integrated to achieve such regulation.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted by the scientific community that anthropogenic
   CO2 emissions are leading to global climate change, notably an increase
   in global temperatures commonly referred to as global warming. The
   primary source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the combustion of
   fossil fuels for energy. As societys demand for energy increases and
   more CO2 is produced, it becomes imperative to decrease the amount
   emitted to the atmosphere. One promising approach to do this is to
   capture CO2 at the effluent of the combustion site, namely, power
   plants, in a process called postcombustion CO2 capture. Technologies to
   achieve this are heavily researched due in large part to the intuitive
   nature of removing CO2 from the stack gas and the ease in retrofitting
   existing CO2 sources with these technologies. As such, several reviews
   have been written on postcombustion CO2 capture. However, it is a
   fast-developing field, and the most recent review papers already do not
   include the state-of-the-art research. Notable among CO2 capture
   technologies are amine-based technologies. Amines are well-known for
   their reversible reactions with CO2, which make them ideal for the
   separation of CO2 from many CO2-containing gases, including flue gas.
   For this reason, this review will cover amine-based technology developed
   and published in and after the year 2013.}},

Abstract = {{We report the gate-tunable photoresponse of a defective graphene over
   the ultraviolet (UV) and the visible light illumination, where the
   defect was generated by plasma irradiation. Plasma induced Dirac point
   shift indicates the p-doping effect. Interestingly the
   defective-graphene field effect transistor (defective-GFET) showed a
   negative shift upon UV illumination, whereas the device showed a
   positive shift under visible light illumination, along with the change
   in the photocurrent. The defective-GFET device showed a high
   photoresponsivity of 37 mA W-1 under visible light, that is similar to 3
   times higher than that of the pristine graphene device. Photoinduced
   molecular desorption causes the UV light responsivity to 18 mA W-1. This
   study shows that the tunable photodetector with high responsivity is
   feasible by introducing an artificial defect on graphene surface}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a newly invented technology that
   can effectively harvest ambient mechanical energy from various motions
   with promising applications in portable electronics, self-powered sensor
   networks, etc. Here, by coupling TENG and a thin film of ferroelectric
   polymer, a new application is designed for TENG as a self-powered memory
   system for recording a mechanical displacement/trace. The output voltage
   produced by the TENG during motion can polarize the dipole moments in
   the ferroelectric thin film. Later, by applying a displacement current
   measurement to detect the polarization density in the ferroelectric
   film, the motion information of the TENG can be directly read. The
   sliding TENG and the single-electrode TENG matrix are both utilized for
   realizing the memorization of the motion trace in one-dimensional and
   two-dimensional space, respectively. Currently, the ferroelectric thin
   film with a size of 3.1 mm(2) can record a minimum area changing of 30
   mm(2) and such resolution can still be possibly improved. These results
   prove that the ferroelectric polymer is an effective memory material to
   work together with TENG and thereby the fabricated memory system can
   potentially be used as a self-powered displacement monitor.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor intrusion from volatile subsurface contaminants can be mitigated
   by aerobic biodegradation. Laboratory column studies with contaminant
   sources of chlorobenzene and a mixture of chlorobenzene,
   1,2-dichlorobenzene, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene showed that contaminants
   were rapidly degraded in thin reactive zones with high biomass and low
   substrate concentrations in the vicinity of the capillary fringe. Such
   behavior was well characterized by a model that includes oxygen-,
   substrate-, and biomass-dependent biodegradation kinetics along with
   diffusive transport processes. An analytical solution was derived to
   provide theoretical support for the simplification of reaction kinetics
   and the approximation of reactive zone location and mass flux
   relationships at steady state. Results demonstrate the potential of
   aerobic natural attenuation in the capillary fringe for preventing
   contaminant migration in the unsaturated zone. The solution indicates
   that increasing contaminant mass flux into the column creates a thinner
   reactive zone and pushes it toward the oxygen boundary, resulting in a
   shorter distance to the oxygen source and a larger oxygen mass flux that
   balances the contaminant mass flux. As a consequence, the aerobic
   biodegradation can reduce high contaminant concentrations to low levels
   within the capillary fringe and unsaturated zone. The results are
   consistent with the observations of thin reactive layers at the
   interface in unsaturated zones. The model considers biomass while
   including biodegradation in the capillary fringe and unsaturated zone
   and clearly demonstrates that microbial communities capable of using the
   contaminants as electron donors may lead to instantaneous degradation
   kinetics in the capillary fringe and unsaturated zone.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of fullerene-water interactions has been the subject of much
   research and debate. Specifically, the presence of a stabilizing,
   negative surface potential on colloidal aggregates of C-60 in water is
   unexpected, given the neutral nature of pure carbon, and is not well
   understood. Previous simulation efforts have focused on the C-60-water
   interaction using molecular dynamics simulations that lacked the ability
   to account for charge transfer and distribution interactions. In this
   study, first-principles density functional theory was used to analyze
   the fundamental electronic interactions to elucidate the polarization
   and charge transfer between water and C-60. Simulations show that charge
   is inductively transferred to the C-60 from water molecules, with
   subsequent polarization of the C-60 molecule. In a case with two
   neighboring C-60 molecules, the charge polarization induces a charge
   onto the second C-60. Simulation suggests that this charge transfer and
   polarization may contribute at least partly to the observed negative
   surface potential of fullerene aggregates and, combined with hydrogen
   bonding network formation around C-60, provides a fundamental driving
   force for aggregate formation in water.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear phenomena, bifurcations, and routes to chaos in an

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of rotating machines can be improved via precisely
   manufactured bearings with reduced clearances; consequently, the
   proclivity for rotor-stator contact is increased. A common model used to
   investigate rotor-stator contact in previous studies is the two
   degree-of-freedom (DOF) rotor with symmetric support stiffness, where
   the contact assumes a linear elastic normal restoring force proportional
   to the rotor stator interference and a tangential dry Coulomb friction
   force. Switching between the contacting and non contacting states
   creates strong nonlinearity in the equations of motion, and the dynamic
   response displays a rich profile of behaviors including periodic,
   quasiperiodic, and chaotic responses via period doubling, sudden
   transitions, quasiperiodicity, and intermittency. For the first time,
   this work emphasizes an asymmetric support stiffness matrix with cross
   coupling between the x and y direction stiffnesses. The influence of
   support asymmetry on the nonlinear rotor response is shown using rotor
   orbits, frequency spectra, Poincare sections, and bifurcation diagrams
   It is found that the cross coupling stiffness coefficient k(xy) has
   negligible effect on the dynamic response until its magnitude is on the
   same order as the direct stiffness coefficients. Direct stiffness
   coefficient asymmetry is shown to affect the rotor's response, where
   even small asymmetries can qualitatively change the response.
   Additionally, the importance of including gravity is investigated, and a
   method is provided for determining the threshold shaft speed above which
   gravity can be ignored. The dominant route to chaos is period-doubling
   for the parameters considered here, though other routes to chaos are
   seen such as a direct transition from periodic to chaotic motion.
   Finally, observations pertaining to rotor modeling, design, and fault
   diagnostics are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Two stage stochastic bilevel programming model of a pre-established
   timberlands supply chain with biorefinery investment interests}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the supply allocation problem, using a Stackelberg
   game, for an established timberlands supply chain with an additional
   decision of new biorefinery investments. In a timberlands system,
   harvester and manufacturer decision makers have separate objectives to
   maximize their respective profits. This interaction is represented with
   a turn based Stackelberg game. The harvesters decide first on the
   quantity harvested, and the manufacturers decide on how much to utilize.
   This game is modeled with a bilevel mathematical program. The novel
   feature of this paper's bilevel formulation is the inclusion of
   parametric uncertainty in a two stage model. The first stage problem
   involves logistical decisions around biorefinery investments, such as
   location and capacity, while the second stage problem involves a bilevel
   timberlands model with parameter uncertainty. Studying this problem
   formulation revealed interesting insights for solving multiperiod
   problems with bilevel stages as well as the decision maker's behavior
   for the timberlands model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory apparatus was constructed to physically realize the
   Burgers' vortex cartoon of turbulence-plankton interactions. Fluid
   motion is induced by corotating two disks while simultaneously
   withdrawing fluid axially through hollow drive shafts. The technique
   creates a flow pattern that mimics a Burgers' vortex with size and
   strength consistent with turbulence vortices in the coastal and
   near-surface zones. Specifically, the radius, circulation, and axial
   strain rate of the Burgers' vortex were specified to match typical
   dissipative vortices corresponding to two turbulence intensity levels
   (described by a mean turbulent dissipation rate of 0.009 cm(2) s(-3) and
   0.096 cm(2) s(-3), respectively). Tomographic particle image velocimetry
   was used to quantify the flow field, calibrate the apparatus, verify
   that it produces the desired vortex characteristics, and provide a
   three-dimensional velocity vector field to compare with zooplankton
   behavioral assays. The apparatus facilitates direct examination of the
   mechanistic aspects of plankton interaction with a turbulent-like
   vortex, which is demonstrated via quantifying the swimming behavior of
   Acartia tonsa in and around the vortex flow structure.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{75-82}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While our understanding of the lymphatic system has improved
   substantially in the past few decades, the translation of this knowledge
   into improved healthcare solutions for patients suffering from secondary
   lymphedema has been severely limited. The challenge facing clinicians is
   two-fold. First, there is no reliable, affordable, diagnostic capable of
   detecting the disease before symptoms of the lymphedema develop and the
   efficacy of treatment options becomes limited. Second, our understanding
   of the disease pathogenesis, its risk factors, and the underlying
   physiologic mechanisms is still in its infancy. These two challenges go
   hand in hand as limited diagnostic options have hindered our ability to
   understand lymphedema progression, and the lack of known underlying
   mechanisms involved in the disease prohibits the development of new
   diagnostic targets. This review serves to discuss the recent
   developments in clinical and lab research settings of both lymphedema
   diagnostic technologies and our understanding of the mechanisms driving
   disease risk and progression. We will show how these two lines of
   research are synergistically working with the ultimate goal of improving
   patient outcomes for those suffering from this horrible disease,
   identifying key areas of further research that are warranted to move the
   field forward and provide clinical relief for this neglected patient

Abstract = {{This article presents a multi-motion control system to help severe
   disabled people operate an auxiliary appliance using neck-up bioelectric
   signals measured by a single-channel dry electrode on the forehead. The
   single-channel dry-electrode multi-motion control system exhibits
   several practical advantages over its conventional counterparts that use
   multi-channel wet-electrodes; among the challenges is an effective
   technique to extract bioelectric features for reliable implementation of
   multi degrees-of-freedom motion control. Using both time and frequency
   characteristics of the single-channel dry-electrode measurements, motion
   commands are derived from multiple feature signals associated with
   concentration demands and different eye-blink actions for use in a
   two-level control strategy that has been developed to control predefined
   multi degrees-of-freedom motion trajectories. Test paradigms were
   designed to pre-calibrate the users' feature signals to statistically
   account for individual variances. Experimental trials were then carried
   out on able-bodied and disabled volunteers to validate the universal
   applicability of the algorithms. The classification success rates for
   two different eye-blink feature signals were approximately 95\% with an
   average time of 2.4 s for executing a concentration feature signal. The
   single-channel dry-electrode-based technique has been validated on a
   6-degree-of-freedom robot arm demonstrating its significant potentials
   to help patients suffering severe motor dysfunctions operate a
   multi-motion auxiliary appliance in everyday living where the ease of
   use is a priority.}},

   Further, mutant (R1049E) vinculin expressing cells are altered in cell
   migration, which is accompanied by changes in cell adhesion, cell
   spreading and cell generation of traction forces, providing direct
   evidence for the critical role of vinculin in mechanotransduction at

Abstract = {{The ability to quantify differences in walking balance proficiency is
   critical to curbing the rising health and financial costs of falls.
   Current laboratory-based approaches typically focus on successful
   recovery of balance while clinical instruments often pose little
   difficulty for all but the most impaired patients. Rarely do they test
   motor behaviors of sufficient difficulty to evoke failures in balance
   control limiting their ability to quantify balance proficiency. Our
   objective was to test whether a simple beam-walking task could quantify
   differences in walking balance proficiency across a range of
   sensorimotor abilities. Ten experts, ten novices, and five individuals
   with transtibial limb loss performed six walking trials across three
   different width beams. Walking balance proficiency was quantified as the
   ratio of distance walked to total possible distance. Balance proficiency
   was not significantly different between cohorts on the wide-beam, but
   clear differences between cohorts on the mid and narrow-beams were
   identified. Experts walked a greater distance than novices on the
   mid-beam (average of 3.63 +/- 0.04 m verus 2.70 +/- 0.21 m out of 3.66
   m; p = 0.009), and novices walked further than amputees (1.52 +/- 0.20
   m; p = 0.03). Amputees were unable to walk on the narrow-beam, while
   experts walked further (3.07 +/- 0.14 m) than novices (1.55 +/- 0.26 m;
   p = 0.0005). A simple beam-walking task and an easily collected measure
   of distance traveled detected differences in walking balance proficiency
   across sensorimotor abilities. This approach provides a means to safely
   study and evaluate successes and failures in walking balance in the
   clinic or lab. It may prove useful in identifying mechanisms underlying
   falls versus fall recoveries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Low-k time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) has been found to vary
   as a function of metal linewidth, when the distance between the lines is
   constant. Modeling requires determining the relationship between TDDB
   and layout geometries. Therefore, comb test structures that vary pattern
   density and linewidth independently have been designed and implemented
   in 45 nm technology. Models are computed to estimate TDDB as a function
   of linewidth, and the cause of variation in TDDB behavior is
   investigated. The methodology to use the models for full-chip analysis
   is explained.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal interface conductance between Al and Si was simulated by a
   non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method. In the simulations, the
   coupling between electrons and phonons in Al are considered by using a
   stochastic force. The results show the size dependence of the interface
   thermal conductance and the effect of electron phonon coupling on the
   interface thermal conductance. To understand the mechanism of interface
   resistance, the vibration power spectra are calculated. We find that the
   atomic level disorder near the interface is an important aspect of
   interfacial phonon transport, which leads to a modification of the
   phonon states near the interface. There, the vibrational spectrum near
   the interface greatly differs from the bulk. This change in the
   vibrational spectrum affects the results predicted by AMM and DMM
   theories and indicates new physics is involved with phonon transport
   across interfaces.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1127-1157}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Solar radiation has a clear signature on the spatial organization of
   ecohydrologic fluxes, vegetation patterns and dynamics, and landscape
   morphology in semiarid ecosystems. Existing landscape evolution models
   (LEMs) do not explicitly consider spatially explicit solar radiation as
   model forcing. Here, we improve an existing LEM to represent coupled
   processes of energy, water, and sediment balance for semiarid fluvial
   catchments. To ground model predictions, a study site is selected in
   central New Mexico where hillslope aspect has a marked influence on
   vegetation patterns and landscape morphology. Model predictions are
   corroborated using limited field observations in central NM and other
   locations with similar conditions. We design a set of comparative LEM
   simulations to investigate the role of spatially explicit solar
   radiation on landscape ecohydro-geomorphic development under different
   uplift scenarios. Aspect-control and network-control are identified as
   the two main drivers of soil moisture and vegetation organization on the
   landscape. Landscape-scale and long-term implications of these
   short-term ecohdrologic patterns emerged in modeled landscapes. As north
   facing slopes (NFS) get steeper by continuing uplift they support
   erosion-resistant denser vegetation cover which leads to further slope
   steepening until erosion and uplift attains a dynamic equilibrium.
   Conversely, on south facing slopes (SFS), as slopes grow with uplift,
   increased solar radiation exposure with slope supports sparser biomass
   and shallower slopes. At the landscape scale, these differential erosion
   processes lead to asymmetric development of catchment forms, consistent
   with regional observations. Understanding of ecohydrogeomorphic
   evolution will improve to assess the impacts of past and future climates
   on landscape response and morphology.}},

Abstract = {{A modification of the Olami, Feder, Christensen (OFC) spring-block model
   in order to model the real contact area of two rigid bodies sliding pass
   each other, is introduced. The modification is based on relaxing the
   assumption of global physical contact and uniform maximal static
   friction. The real contact area is estimated by means of specific
   distribution parameters of the emerged distribution functions of the
   slip sizes (incremental displacements). It is shown that for a wide
   range of model parameters there is a clear monotonic relationship
   between the real contact area and the distribution parameters. As a
   result, the proposed model allows for the determination of the real
   contact area in an indirect way through the experimental determination
   of the probability density function of the slip sizes of one body as it
   moves relative to the other. (C) 2014 Politechnika Wrociawska. Published

Abstract = {{Metal-based nanoparticles (MNPs) may be translocated and biochemically

   14 days. Micro X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) and micro X-ray absorption
   near edge structure (mu-XANES) analysis revealed that CuO NPs moved into
   the root epidermis, exodermis, and cortex, and they ultimately reached
   the endodermis but could not easily pass the Casparian strip; however,
   the formation of lateral roots provided a potential pathway for MNPs to
   enter the stele. Moreover, bulk-XANES data showed that CuO NPs were
   transported from the roots to the leaves, and that Cu (II) combined with
   cysteine, citrate, and phosphate ligands and was even reduced to Cu (I).
   CuO NPs and Cu-citrate were observed in the root cells using soft X-ray

Abstract = {{Characterizing the spectrum of sparse wideband signals of high-speed
   devices efficiently and precisely is critical in high-speed test
   instrumentation design. Recently proposed sub-Nyquist rate sampling
   systems have the potential to significantly reduce the cost and
   complexity of sparse spectrum characterization; however, due to
   imperfections and variations in hardware design, numerous implementation
   and calibration issues have risen and need to be solved for robust and
   stable signal acquisition. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and
   low-complexity hardware architecture and associated asynchronous
   multi-rate sub-Nyquist rate sampling based algorithms for sparse
   spectrum characterization. The proposed scheme can be implemented with a
   single ADC or with multiple ADCs as in multi-channel or band-interleaved
   sensing architectures. Compared to other sub-Nyquist rate sampling
   methods, the proposed hardware scheme can achieve wideband sparse
   spectrum characterization with minimum cost and calibration effort. A
   hardware prototype built using off-the-shelf components is used to
   demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the growth of Al0.57Ga0.43N/Al0.38Ga0.63N MQWs grown on a
   relaxed Al0.58Ga0.42N buffer on AlN template by Metal Organic Vapor
   Phase Epitaxy. The MQW structure is designed so that the strain in the
   quantum wells induced by their lattice mismatch with barriers is
   sufficient to enhance TE polarized emission (E-field perpendicular to
   c). A 630-nm thick relaxed Al0.58Ga0.42N buffer grown on AlN template
   serves as a pseudo-substrate to release the strain in the barriers and
   to avoid related defects or composition fluctuation in the active
   region. Thin (< 2 nm) quantum wells allow preservation of the
   overlapping of electron and hole wavefunctions considering the strong
   quantum-confined Stark effect in AlGaN-based MQW structures. Scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled to energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis is used to optimize the growth
   conditions and to determine the composition of wells and barriers.
   Optical characterizations of the grown structure reveal a well-defined
   band-edge emission peak at 285 nm. Based on macro-transmission
   measurements and simulations, the absorption coefficient of the wells is
   estimated to be 3 x 10(5) cm(-1) (E-field perpendicular to c), attesting
   that the oscillator strength is preserved for these AlGaN MQWs with high
   Al content, which is promising for efficient surface-emitting devices in
   the deep ultra-violet (DUV) region. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Effects of wall electrodes on Hall effect thruster plasma}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the physical mechanisms that cause beneficial
   and detrimental performance effect observed to date in Hall effect
   thrusters with wall electrodes. It is determined that the wall electrode
   sheath can reduce ion losses to the wall if positioned near the anode
   (outside the dense region of the plasma) such that an ion-repelling
   sheath is able to form. The ability of the wall electrode to form an
   ion-repelling sheath is inversely proportional to the current drawn-if
   the wall electrode becomes the dominant sink for the thruster discharge
   current, increases in wall electrode bias result in increased local
   plasma potential rather than an ion-repelling sheath. A single-fluid
   electron flow model gives results that mimic the observed potential
   structures and the current-sharing fractions between the anode and wall
   electrodes, showing that potential gradients in the presheath and bulk
   plasma come at the expense of current draw to the wall electrodes.
   Secondary electron emission from the wall electrodes (or lack thereof)
   is inferred to have a larger effect if the electrodes are positioned
   near the exit plane than if positioned near the anode, due to the
   difference in energy deposition from the plasma. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The flexibility of insect wings confers aerodynamic benefits, but can
   also present a hazard if exposed to fog or dew. Fog can cause water to
   accumulate on wings, bending them into tight taco shapes and rendering
   them useless for flight. In this combined experimental and theoretical
   study, we use high-speed video to film the spontaneous folding of
   isolated mosquito wings due to the evaporation of a water drop. We
   predict shapes of the deformed wing using two-dimensional elastica
   theory, considering both surface tension and Laplace pressure. We also
   recommend fold-resistant geometries for the wings of flapping
   micro-aerial vehicles. Our work reveals the mechanism of insect wing
   folding and provides a framework for further study of capillarity-driven
   folding in both natural and biomimetic systems at small scales. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The effect of advance ratio on the flow structures above a rotor blade
   in dynamic-stall is studied using stereoscopic particle image
   velocimetry. The dynamic-stall vortex shows a significant velocity
   component in its core, implying a helical structure progressing radially
   outboard. In addition, a dual-vortical structure was observed at inboard
   locations only at high advance ratios. The radial velocity attenuates at
   outboard locations, in contrast to the expected increase with
   centripetal acceleration. This attenuation is accompanied by an increase
   in unsteadiness of the vortex. The unsteadiness shows a low-frequency
   cycle-to-cycle variation despite steady freestream conditions and
   phase-locked blade tracking. Proper orthogonal decomposition analysis of
   the dominant flow mode confirms the unsteady behavior of the
   leading-edge vortex. The dependence on advance ratio is used to relate
   the unsteadiness of the dynamic-stall vortex to Coriolis effects. (C)

Title = {{Synchronous in-field application of life-detection techniques in

Abstract = {{Field expeditions that simulate the operations of robotic planetary
   exploration missions at analog sites on Earth can help establish best
   practices and are therefore a positive contribution to the planetary
   exploration community. There are many sites in Iceland that possess
   heritage as planetary exploration analog locations and whose
   environmental extremes make them suitable for simulating scientific
   sampling and robotic operations.
   We conducted a planetary exploration analog mission at two recent lava
   fields in Iceland, Fimmvorouhals (2010) and Eldfell (1973), using a
   specially developed field laboratory. We tested the utility of in-field
   site sampling down selection and tiered analysis operational
   capabilities with three life detection and characterization techniques:
   fluorescence microscopy (FM), adenine-triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence
   assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. The
   study made use of multiple cycles of sample collection at multiple
   distance scales and field laboratory analysis using the synchronous
   fife-detection techniques to heuristically develop the continuing
   sampling and analysis strategy during the expedition.
   Here we report the operational lessons learned and provide brief
   summaries of scientific data. The full scientific data report will
   follow separately. We found that rapid in-field analysis to determine
   subsequent sampling decisions is operationally feasible, and that the
   chosen life detection and characterization techniques are suitable for a
   terrestrial life-detection field mission.
   In-field analysis enables the rapid obtainment of scientific data and
   thus facilitates the collection of the most scientifically relevant
   samples within a single field expedition, without the need for sample
   relocation to external laboratories. The operational lessons learned in
   this study could be applied to future terrestrial field expeditions
   employing other analytical techniques and to future robotic planetary
   exploration missions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of Selective Heparin Desulfation on Preservation of Bone
   Morphogenetic Protein-2 Bioactivity after Thermal Stress}},
Journal = {{BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) plays an important role in bone and
   cartilage formation and is of interest in regenerative medicine. Heparin
   can interact electrostatically with BMP-2 and thus has been explored for
   controlled release and potential stabilization of this growth factor in
   vivo. However, in its natively sulfated state, heparin has potent
   anticoagulant properties that may limit its use. Desulfation reduces
   anticoagulant properties, but may impact heparin's ability to interact
   and protect BMP-2 from denaturation. The goal of this study was to
   characterize three selectively desulfated heparin species (N-desulfated
   (Hep(-N)), 6-O,N-desulfated (Hep(-N),(-6O)), and completely desulfated
   heparin (Hep(-)) and determine if the sulfation level of heparin
   affected the level of BMP-2 bioactivity after heat treatment at 65
   degrees C. BMP-2 bioactivity was evaluated using the established C2C12
   cell assay. The resulting alkaline phosphatase activity data
   demonstrated that native heparin maintained a significant amount of
   BMP-2 bioactivity and the effect appeared to be heparin concentration
   dependent. Although all three had the same molecular charge as
   determined by zeta potential measurements, desulfated heparin
   derivatives Hep(-N) and Hep(-N),(-6O)) were not as effective as native
   heparin in maintaining BMP-2 bioactivity (only similar to 35\% of
   original activity remained in both cases). These findings can be used to
   better select desulfated heparin species that exhibit low anticoagulant
   activity while extending the half-life of BMP-2 in solution and in
   delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{The primary focus of computer simulation in transportation engineering
   has been to model individual systems using modeling software packages
   designed for the specific system under investigation. However, this
   limits the ability to explore interactions between multiple disparate
   transportation systems in a dynamic modeling environment. To address
   this gap, this study develops and tests a technique to federate two
   transportation models, each constructed using different simulation
   software packages: (1) a discrete event-based simulation model of a
   freight trucking terminal and (2) a discrete time-step-based traffic
   microscopic simulation model of the network serving the terminal. The
   federation technique is tested to consider potential feedback loops that
   may arise between the models during a single simulation run. It is then
   applied in a notional case study of the Port of Savannah to further
   assess its capabilities. The findings suggest that this federated
   simulation technique captures the dynamic interaction of the two systems
   being modeled. A comparison of the observed versus expected time-based
   characteristics of the interactions are shown to yield statistically
   significant correlation.}},

Abstract = {{Solution casting using a sacrificial template is a simple technique to
   fabricate vertical arrays of polymer nanotubes. However, because of
   their close proximity and high aspect ratios, large capillary forces
   cause nanotubes to cluster as the array dries; researchers often use
   special drying techniques to avoid this clustering. Here, we exploit the
   clustering of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) nanotubes in
   a unique template etching process to create surfaces that exhibit
   tunable wetting and contact thermal energy transport. Vertical arrays of
   rr-P3HT nanotubes are cast from solution in nanoscale alumina templates,
   and a solution etching process is used to partially release the
   nanotubes from the template. The clustering of rr-P3HT nanotube tips
   upon template etching produces hierarchical surface structuring with a
   distinct pattern of interconnected ridges, and the spacing between the
   ridges increases with increased template etch times. These changes in
   morphology cause the water contact angle to increase from 141 degrees to
   168 degrees as the etch time is increased from 4 to 12 min. When
   assembled into an interface, the morphological changes cause the thermal
   contact resistance of the vertical rr-P3HT nanotube arrays to increase
   linearly at a rate of approximately 6 mm(2).K/W per 2 min etch interval
   (after 6 min of etching is surpassed). The effective thermal
   conductivity of the rr-P3HT nanotube arrays is 1 +/- 0.2 W/mK
   independent of the etch time, which is approximately 5 times higher than
   the bulk rr-P3HT film value.}},

   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains with different grafting
   architecture and variable amino acid-PEG graft composition for cell
   encapsulation. The molecular weight of poly amino acids (length of side
   chains), molecular weight and degree of PEG grafting (D) were varied in
   order to assess the formation of cytocompatible and robust
   layer-by-layer (LbL) shells on two types of bacterial cells
   (Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria). We observed that shells
   assembled with charged polycationic amino acids adversely effected the
   properties of microbial cells while promoting the formation of large
   cell aggregates. In contrast, hydrogen-bonded shells with high PEG
   grafting density were the most cytocompatible, while promoting formation
   of stable colloidal suspensions of individual cell encapsulates. The
   stability to degradation of silk shells (under standard cell incubation
   procedure) was related to the intrinsic properties of thermodynamic
   bonding forces, with shells based on electrostatic interactions having
   stronger resistance to deterioration compared to pure hydrogen-bonded
   silk shells. By optimizing the charge density of silk polyelectrolytes
   brushes, as well as the length and the degree of PEG side grafts, robust

   Lowering substrate temperature during the spacer segment growth reduces
   this residual carrier density and results in a spectral response that is

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to permanent motor and sensory
   deficits. Following the initial traumatic insult, secondary injury
   mechanisms characterized by persistent heightened inflammation are
   initiated and lead to continued and pervasive cell death and tissue
   damage. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as methylprednisolone (MP) used
   clinically have ambiguous benefits with debilitating side effects.
   Typically, these drugs are administered systemically at high doses,
   resulting in toxicity and paradoxically increased inflammation.
   Furthermore, these drugs have a small time window postinjury (few hours)
   during which they need to be infused to be effective. As an alternative
   to MP, we investigated the effect of a small molecule inhibitor (Chicago
   sky blue, CSB) of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) for
   treating SCI. The pleiotropic cytokine MIF is known to contribute to
   upregulation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in various disease
   and injury states. In vitro, CSB administration alleviated
   endotoxin-mediated inflammation in primary microglia and macrophages.
   Nanocarriers such as liposomes can potentially alleviate systemic side
   effects of high-dose therapy by enabling site-specific drug delivery to
   the spinal cord. However, the therapeutic window of 100 nm scale
   nanoparticle localization to the spinal cord after contusion injury is
   not fully known. Thus, we first investigated the ability of nanocarriers
   of different sizes to localize to the injured spinal cord up to 2 weeks
   postinjury. Results from the study showed that nanocarriers as large as
   200 nm in diameter could extravasate into the injured spinal cord up to
   96 h postinjury. We then formulated nanocarriers (liposomes)
   encapsulating CSB and administered them intravenously 48 h postinjury,
   within the previously determined 96 h therapeutic window. In vivo, in
   this clinically relevant contusion injury model in rats, CSB
   administration led to preservation of vascular and white matter
   integrity, improved wound healing, and an increase in levels of arginase
   and other transcripts indicative of a resolution phase of wound healing.
   This study demonstrates the potential of MIF inhibition in SCI and the
   utility of nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery selectively to the injured
   cord.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new post-fault modulation strategy is proposed to
   operate the direct matrix converter as close as possible to its desired
   normal operation under an open-switch fault condition. The proposed
   strategy determines appropriate switching states associated with eight,
   out of the nine, remaining healthy switches of the converter, to
   synthesize the reference voltages. The corresponding duty cycles of the
   determined switching states are calculated by formulating a nonlinear
   optimization problem that aims at minimization of the error between the
   desired reference voltages and the voltages generated by the switching
   states. The solution to the nonlinear optimization problem is obtained
   based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The performance of the
   proposed modulation strategy is evaluated based on time-domain
   simulation studies in the MATLAB/Simulink software environment and also

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate multiuser scheduling with joint user
   pairing, resource allocation, and power control (PC) in Long-Term
   Evolution (LTE) uplink cellular networks. We first derive the received
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in spatial multiuser
   single-carrier frequency-division multiple-access (SC-FDMA) systems with
   frequency-domain minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization. Based on
   this, we formulate an optimization problem as joint multiuser pairing,
   resource allocation, and PC to maximize the weighted throughput of the
   system. We then divide it into a two-step optimization problem, which is
   suboptimal but significantly reduces the complexity. The two-step
   problem first performs optimal frequency resource allocation and user
   pairing for a given transmit power value and then adjusts the transmit
   power to maximize the weighted throughput when frequency resources are
   allocated and users are paired. With the help of high-interference
   indicators exchanged among multiple base stations (BSs), we develop an
   iterative distributed and low-complexity algorithm to further simplify
   the two-step problem. System-level simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate interference and

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{870-881}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The heavy-tailed nature in dynamic spectrum access networks challenges
   the applicability of conventional network stability criterion. To
   counter this problem, a new stability criterion, namely moment
   stability, is introduced, which requires that all secondary users (SUs)
   with light-tailed traffic have bounded queueing delay with finite mean
   and variance. This stability criterion can prevent heavy-tailed traffic,
   e.g., video and Internet traffic, from degrading the QoS performance of
   light-tailed ones, e.g., email deliveries and audio/voice traffic. The
   critical conditions for the existence of a scheduling policy to achieve
   moment stability are derived. The network stability region yielded from
   these conditions is shown to be directly related to the primary and
   secondary user activities, the number of SUs, and the total number of
   primary user channels available to SUs. Moreover, it is shown that the
   maximum-weight-alpha scheduling algorithm, which makes the scheduling
   decision based on the queue lengths raised to the alpha-th power, is
   throughput optimal with respect to moment stability. It is proven that
   its throughput optimality holds independent of the stochastic properties
   of SU traffic including its marginal distribution (i.e., heavy-tailed or
   light-tailed distribution) and its time correlation structure (i.e.,
   long range or short range dependence).}},

Abstract = {{Small-diameter gun-launched projectiles pose a challenging platform on
   which to implement closed-loop guidance and control. This paper presents
   a novel imager-based guidance and control algorithm for small-diameter
   spin-stabilized projectiles. The control law is specifically formulated
   to rely on feedback only from a strapdown detector and roll angle
   sensors. Following introduction of the projectile nonlinear dynamic
   model, an integrated guidance and control algorithm is presented in
   which control commands are computed directly from detector feedback
   using a gain-scheduled proportional control. Time-varying controller
   gains are derived through a surrogate modeling approach, and controller
   performance is further enhanced through use of an observer that filters
   unwanted angular motion components from detector feedback. Example
   closed-loop flight simulations demonstrate performance of the proposed
   control system, and MonteCarlo analysis shows a factor of 2 accuracy
   improvement for the closed-loop system over ballistic flight. Results
   indicate that delivery system improvements are achievable in small,
   gyroscopically stabilized projectiles containing low-cost guidance
   elements using the proposed integrated guidance and control approach.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing represents the direct fabrication of
   parts layer-by-layer, guided by digital information from a
   computer-aided design file without any part-specific tooling. Over the
   past three decades, a variety of 3D printing technologies have evolved
   that have transformed the idea of direct printing of parts for numerous
   applications. Three-dimensional printing technology offers significant
   advantages for biomedical devices and tissue engineering due to its
   ability to manufacture low-volume or one-of-a-kind parts on-demand based
   on patient-specific needs, at no additional cost for different designs
   that can vary from patient to patient, while also offering flexibility
   in the starting materials. However, many concerns remain for widespread
   applications of 3D-printed biomaterials, including regulatory issues, a
   sterile environment for part fabrication, and the achievement of target
   material properties with the desired architecture. This article offers a
   broad overview of the field of 3D-printed biomaterials along with a few
   specific applications to assist the reader in obtaining an understanding

Abstract = {{The enhancement and confinement of electromagnetic radiation to
   nanometer scale have improved the performances and decreased the
   dimensions of optical sources and detectors for several applications
   including spectroscopy, medical applications, and quantum information.
   Realization of on-chip nanofocusing devices compatible with silicon
   photonics platform adds a key functionality and provides opportunities
   for sensing, trapping, on-chip signal processing, and communications.
   Here, we discuss the design, fabrication, and experimental demonstration
   of light nanofocusing in a hybrid plasmonic-photonic nanotaper
   structure. We discuss the physical mechanisms behind the operation of
   this device, the coupling mechanisms, and how to engineer the energy
   transfer from a propagating guided mode to a trapped plasmonic mode at
   the apex of the plasmonic nanotaper with minimal radiation loss. Optical
   near-field measurements and Fourier modal analysis carried out using a
   near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) show a tight nanofocusing
   of light in this structure to an extremely small spot of
   0.00563(lambda/(2n(r(max))))(3) confined in 3D and an exquisite power
   input conversion of 92\%. Our experiments also verify the mode
   selectivity of the device (low transmission of a TM-like input mode and
   high transmission of a TE-like input mode). A large field concentration
   factor (FCF) of about 4.9 is estimated from our NSOM measurement with a
   radius of curvature of about 20 nm at the apex of the nanotaper. The
   agreement between our theory and experimental results reveals helpful
   insights about the operation mechanism of the device, the interplay of
   the modes, and the gradual power transfer to the nanotaper apex.}},

Abstract = {{Resonance energy transfer (RET) has been employed for interpreting the
   energy interaction of graphene combined with semiconductor materials
   such as nanoparticles and quantum-well (QW) heterostructures.
   Especially, for the application of graphene as a transparent electrode
   for semiconductor light emitting diodes, the mechanism of exciton
   recombination processes such as RET in graphene-semiconductor QW
   heterojunctions should be understood clearly. Here, we characterized the
   temperature-dependent RET behaviors in graphene/semiconductor QW
   heterostructures. We then observed the tuning of the RET efficiency from
   5\% to 30\% in graphene/QW heterostructures with similar to 60 nm
   dipoledipole coupled distance at temperatures of 300 to 10 K. This
   survey allows us to identify the roles of localized and free excitons in
   the RET process from the QWs to graphene as a function of temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic control is a powerful means for maneuvering the twin structure
   and shape of metal nanocrystals and thus optimizing their performance in
   a variety of applications. However, there is only a vague understanding
   of the explicit roles played by reaction kinetics due to the lack of
   quantitative information about the kinetic parameters. With Pd as an
   example, here we demonstrate that kinetic parameters, including rate
   constant and activation energy, can be derived from spectroscopic
   measurements and then used to calculate the initial reduction rate and
   further have this parameter quantitatively correlated with the twin
   structure of a seed and nanocrystal. On a quantitative basis, we were
   able to determine the ranges of initial reduction rates required for the
   formation of nanocrystals with a specific twin structure, including
   single-crystal, multiply twinned, and stacking fault-lined. This work
   represents a major step forward toward the deterministic syntheses of
   colloidal noble-metal nanocrystals with specific twin structures and
   shapes.}},

Journal = {{ACTA DIABETOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{133-142}},

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well known for its adverse impacts on
   brain and cognition, which leads to multidimensional cognitive deficits
   and wildly spread cerebral structure abnormalities. However, existing
   literatures are mainly focused on patients with advanced age or extended
   T2DM duration. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how brain
   function would be affected at the initial onset stage of T2DM in
   relatively younger population. In current study, twelve newly diagnosed
   middle-aged T2DM patients with no previous diabetic treatment history
   and twelve matched controls were recruited. Brain activations during a
   working memory task, the digit n-back paradigm (0-, 1- and 2-back), were
   obtained with functional magnetic resonance imaging and tested by
   repeated measures ANOVA. Whereas patients performed the n-back task
   comparably well as controls, significant load-by-group interactions of
   brain activation were found in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC), left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, and left parietal cortex,
   where patients exhibited hyperactivation in the 2-back, but not the
   0-back or 1-back condition compared to controls. Furthermore, the
   severity of chronic hyperglycemia, estimated by glycosylated hemoglobin
   (HbA(1c)) level, was entered into partial correlational analyses with
   task-related brain activations, while controlling for the real-time
   influence of glucose, estimated by instant plasma glucose level measured
   before scanning. Significant positive correlations were found between
   HbA(1c) and brain activations in the anterior cingulate cortex and
   bilateral DLPFC only in patients. Taken together, these findings suggest
   there might be a compensatory mechanism due to brain inefficiency
   related to chronic hyperglycemia at the initial onset stage of T2DM.}},

Abstract = {{Aeroelastic energy harvesting by transforming wind energy into low-power
   electricity via low-profile and geometrically scalable devices has
   received growing attention in the literature of energy harvesting for
   wireless electronic components. The goal is to harvest flow energy
   available in high-wind areas toward enabling self-powered systems, such
   as sensor networks employed in structural health and usage monitoring of
   aircraft and rotorcraft. Other than bluff-body-based energy harvester
   configurations using vortex-induced vibrations, the use of an
   aeroelastic typical section with a proper transduction mechanism is a
   popular and convenient approach to create instabilities and persistent
   oscillations for flow energy harvesting. In this work, a hybrid
   three-degree-of-freedom airfoil-based aeroelastic energy harvester that
   simultaneously uses piezoelectric transduction and electromagnetic
   induction is analyzed based on fully coupled electroaeroelastic
   modeling. This particular configuration exploits a control surface for
   enhanced design flexibility as compared to its well-explored
   two-degree-of-freedom counterparts. The two transduction mechanisms are
   added to the plunge degree of freedom in the presence of two separate
   electrical loads, and dimensionless electroaeroelastic equations are
   obtained. The effects of aeroelastic parameters and load resistance
   values on the overall electroaeroelastic behavior (total power
   generation and linear flutter speed) are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study on Doherty power
   amplifiers (PAs) under antenna impedance mismatch. It is demonstrated
   for the first time that by varying the relative gain and phase of the
   carrier and peaking amplifiers, the PA performance degradation caused by
   the antenna impedance mismatch can be largely compensated. Such a
   compensation effect is discussed extensively for different antenna
   impedance conditions. Four types of Doherty PAs, i.e., three digital
   Doherty PAs with different degrees of flexibility and the classical
   analog Doherty PA, are covered in the complete theoretical analysis. To
   intuitively show the proposed concept, this paper presents numerical
   simulation results based on the theoretical analysis. In addition,
   measurement results on a fully integrated digital Doherty PA implemented
   in 65-nm bulk CMOS are demonstrated to verify our theoretical study.}},

Abstract = {{Prebond testing of through-silicon-vias (TSVs) and die logic is a
   significant challenge and a potential roadblock for 3-D integration.
   Built-in self-test solutions introduce considerable die area overhead.
   Oversized probe pads on TSVs to provide prebond test access limit both
   test bandwidth and TSV density. This paper presents a solution to these
   problems, allowing a probe card to contact TSVs without the need for
   probe pads, enabling both TSV and prebond scan test. Several possible
   prebond scan test configurations are shown-they provide varying degrees
   of test parallelism under design constraints. HSPICE simulations are
   performed on two logic-on-logic 3-D benchmarks. Results show that the
   ratio of the number of probe needles available for test access to the
   number of prebond scan chains determines which prebond scan
   configuration results in the shortest test time. Maximum prebond scan-in
   and scan-out shift-clock speeds are determined for dies in a benchmark
   3-D design as a function of driver strength and transmission gate width.
   These clock speeds show that prebond scan test can be performed at a
   speed that is comparable with scan testing of packaged dies. The maximum
   clock speed can also be tuned by changing the drive strength of the
   probe and on-die drivers of the TSV network. Estimates are also provided
   for peak and average power consumption during prebond scan test for both
   a high-power pattern per scan chain and an average power pattern per
   scan chain. On-die area overhead for the proposed method is estimated to
   be between 1.0\% and 2.9\% per die for two 3-D benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of RF circuits in deeply scaled CMOS technologies and severe
   process variation in those technology nodes result in poor manufacturing
   yield. A post-manufacture tuning approach for yield improvement of RF
   systems is developed in this paper that uses hierarchical behavioral
   models of the RF systems. The proposed method first determines
   module-level performances from the system-level response (signature) to
   an applied test using top-down model diagnosis. Then, constrained
   optimization is performed to determine the best module-level tuning
   parameter values that satisfy system-level specifications (bottom-up
   analysis) in a power-conscious manner. Both top-down and bottom-up
   analysis techniques are supported by hierarchical RF behavioral models.
   The relationship between module-level tuning parameters and module-level
   performance metrics changes from instance to instance depending on
   amount of process variation and this factor is included in the proposed
   tuning procedure. A key benefit of the proposed approach is that only a
   single-test application is needed at a fixed number of tuning knob
   settings resulting in reduction in tuning time. The efficiency of the
   proposed technique is demonstrated using simulation results and hardware
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Surface microroughness plays an important role in determining osteoblast
   behavior on titanium. Previous studies have shown that osteoblast
   differentiation on microtextured titanium substrates is dependent on
   alpha-2 beta-1 (alpha 2 beta 1) integrin signaling. This study used
   focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy, combined with
   three-dimensional image reconstruction, to investigate early
   interactions of individual cells with their substrate and the role of
   integrin alpha 2 beta 1 in determining cell shape. MG63 osteoblast-like
   cells on sand blasted/acid etched (SLA) Ti surfaces after 3 days of
   culturing indicated decreased cell number, increased cell
   differentiation, and increased expression of mRNA levels for alpha 1,
   alpha 2, alpha V, and beta 1 integrin subunits compared to cells on
   smooth Ti (PT) surfaces. alpha 2 or beta 1 silenced cells exhibited
   increased cell number and decreased differentiation on SLA compared to
   wild-type cells. Wild-type cells on SLA possessed an elongated
   morphology with reduced cell area, increased cell thickness, and more
   apparent contact points. Cells on PT exhibited greater spreading and
   were relatively flat. Silenced cells possessed a morphology and
   phenotype similar to wild-type cells grown on PT. These observations
   indicate that surface microroughness affects cell response via alpha 2
   beta 1 integrin signaling, resulting in a cell shape that promotes
   osteoblastic differentiation. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Squamates classified as `subarenaceous' possess the ability to move long
   distances within dry sand; body elongation among sand and soil burrowers
   has been hypothesized to enhance subsurface performance. Using X-ray
   imaging, we performed the first kinematic investigation of the
   subsurface locomotion of the long, slender shovel-nosed snake
   (Chionactis occipitalis) and compared its biomechanics with those of the
   shorter, limbed sandfish lizard (Scincus scincus). The sandfish was
   previously shown to maximize swimming speed and minimize the mechanical
   cost of transport during burial. Our measurements revealed that the
   snake also swims through sand by propagating traveling waves down the
   body, head to tail. Unlike the sandfish, the snake nearly followed its
   own tracks, thus swimming in an approximate tube of self-fluidized
   granular media. We measured deviations from tube movement by introducing
   a parameter, the local slip angle, beta(s), which measures the angle
   between the direction of movement of each segment and body orientation.
   The average beta(s), was smaller for the snake than for the sandfish;
   granular resistive force theory (RFT) revealed that the curvature
   utilized by each animal optimized its performance. The snake benefits
   from its slender body shape (and increased vertebral number), which
   allows propagation of a higher number of optimal curvature body
   undulations. The snake's low skin friction also increases performance.
   The agreement between experiment and RFT combined with the relatively
   simple properties of the granular `frictional fluid' make subarenaceous
   swimming an attractive system to study functional morphology and bauplan
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) are the mainstream of wind power
   industry in the world; however, as turbines are becoming bigger, the
   maintenance of equipments grows more complex and costs much higher.
   Compared with HAWTs, Darrieus vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have
   more technological advantages, providing an alternative for the wind
   power technology; hence Darrieus VAWTs are catching more eyes.
   Nevertheless, the majority of wind turbine design currently focuses on
   HAWTs, researches on Darrieus VAWTs have lagged significantly behind
   those on HAWTs, which have greatly hindered the development of VAWTs.
   Accordingly, this paper reviews the main basic research methods and
   their corresponding applications in Darrieus VAWTs, aiming to let more
   experts know the current research status and also provide some guidance

Title = {{Gelatin methacrylate microspheres for controlled growth factor release}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{101-110}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Gelatin has been commonly used as a delivery vehicle for various
   biomolecules for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
   applications due to its simple fabrication methods, inherent
   electrostatic binding properties, and proteolytic degradability.
   Compared to traditional chemical cross-linking methods, such as the use
   of glutaraldehyde (GA), methacrylate modification of gelatin offers an
   alternative method to better control the extent of hydrogel
   cross-linking. Here we examined the physical properties and growth
   factor delivery of gelatin methacrylate (GMA) microparticles (MPs)
   formulated with a wide range of different cross-linking densities
   (15-90\%). Less methacrylated MPs had decreased elastic moduli and
   larger mesh sizes compared to GA MPs, with increasing methacrylation
   correlating to greater moduli and smaller mesh sizes. As expected, an
   inverse correlation between microparticle cross-linking density and
   degradation was observed, with the lowest cross-linked GMA MPs degrading
   at the fastest rate, comparable to GA MPs. Interestingly, GMA MPs at
   lower cross-linking densities could be loaded with up to a 10-fold
   higher relative amount of growth factor than conventional GA
   cross-linked MPs, despite the GA MPs having an order of magnitude
   greater gelatin content. Moreover, a reduced GMA cross-linking density
   resulted in more complete release of bone morphogenic protein 4 and
   basic fibroblast growth factor and accelerated release rate with
   collagenase treatment. These studies demonstrate that GMA MPs provide a
   more flexible platform for growth factor delivery by enhancing the
   relative binding capacity and permitting proteolytic degradation
   tunability, thereby offering a more potent controlled release system for
   growth factor delivery. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Despite its widespread clinical use in load-bearing orthopedic implants,
   polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) is often associated with poor
   osseointegration. In this study, a surface-porous PEEK material
   (PEEK-SP) was created using a melt extrusion technique. The porous layer
   was 399.6 +/- 63.3 lam thick and possessed a mean pore size of 279.9 +/-
   31.6 mu m. strut spacing of 186.8 +/- 55.5 mu m, porosity of 67.3 +/-
   3.1\% and interconnectivity of 99.9 +/- 0.1\%. Monotonic tensile tests
   showed that PEEK-SP preserved 73.9\% of the strength (71.06 +/- 2.17
   MPa) and 73.4\% of the elastic modulus (2.45 +/- 0.31 GPa) of
   as-received, injection-molded PEEK. PEEK-SP further demonstrated a
   fatigue strength of 60.0 MPa at one million cycles, preserving 73.4\% of
   the fatigue resistance of injection-molded PEEK. Interfacial shear
   testing showed the pore layer shear strength to be 23.96 +/- 2.26 MPa.
   An osseointegration model in the rat revealed substantial bone formation
   within the pore layer at 6 and 12 weeks via microcomputed tomography and
   histological evaluation. Ingrown bone was more closely apposed to the
   pore wall and fibrous tissue growth was reduced in PEEK-SP when compared
   to non-porous PEEK controls. These results indicate that PEEK-SP could
   provide improved osseointegration while maintaining the structural
   integrity necessary for load-bearing orthopedic applications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Neurally controlled prosthetics that cosmetically and functionally mimic
   amputated limbs remain a clinical need because state of the art neural
   prosthetics only provide a fraction of a natural limb's functionality.
   Here, we report on the fabrication and capability of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and epoxy-based SU-8 photoresist
   microchannel scaffolds to serve as viable constructs for peripheral
   nerve interfacing through in vitro and in vivo studies in a sciatic
   nerve amputee model where the nerve lacks distal reinnervation targets.
   These studies showed microchannels with 100 gm x 100 gm cross-sectional
   areas support and direct the regeneration/migration of axons, Schwann
   cells, and fibroblasts through the microchannels with space available
   for future maturation of the axons. Investigation of the nerve in the
   distal segment, past the scaffold, showed a high degree of organization,
   adoption of the microchannel architecture forming `microchannel
   fascicles', reformation of endoneurial tubes and axon myelination, and a
   lack of aberrant and unorganized growth that might be characteristic of
   neuroma formation. Separate chronic terminal in vivo electrophysiology
   studies utilizing the microchannel scaffolds with permanently integrated
   microwire electrodes were conducted to evaluate interfacing
   capabilities. In all devices a variety of spontaneous, sensory evoked
   and electrically evoked single and multi-unit action potentials were
   recorded after five months of implantation. Together, these findings
   suggest that microchannel scaffolds are well suited for chronic
   implantation and peripheral nerve interfacing to promote organized nerve
   regeneration that lends itself well to stable interfaces. Thus this
   study establishes the basis for the advanced fabrication of
   large-electrode count, wireless microchannel devices that are an
   important step towards highly functional, bi-directional peripheral
   nerve interfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical oxidation of activated carbon by H2O2 and H2SO4 is
   investigated, structural and chemical modifications are characterized,
   and the materials are used as catalysts for the hydrolysis of cellulose.
   Treatment with H2O2 enlarges the pore size and imparts functional groups
   such as phenols, lactones, and carboxylic acids. H2SO4 treatment targets
   the edges of carbon sheets primarily, and this effect is more pronounced
   with a higher temperature. Adsorption isotherms demonstrate that the
   adsorption of oligomers on functionalized carbon is dominated by van der
   Waals forces. The materials treated chemically are active for the
   hydrolysis of cellulose despite the relative weakness of most of their
   acid sites. It is proposed that a synergistic effect between defect
   sites and functional groups enhances the activity by inducing a
   conformational change in the glucan chains if they are adsorbed at
   defect sites. This activates the glycosidic bonds for hydrolysis by
   in-plane functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene (PE) pipes have a great ability to resist deformation,
   which is one of the important reasons that PE pipes are used more and
   more widely in urban gas transportation systems. In this paper, a
   numerical simulation was conducted in ABAQUS, for the most commonly used
   PE pipe of DN110-SDR11, under the action of foundation settlement. The
   situation that PE pipe is perpendicular to settlement section was
   considered. The variation of piping stress vs settlement displacement
   was analyzed, and influence of length of transition section on pipe
   yielding was discussed. It was found that the maximum Mises stress of PE
   pipe increases with the increment of settlement displacement, but the
   location is changing, and the dangerous section occurs at the junction
   of transition section and subsidence area or the junction of transition
   section and non-subsidence area. Pipe yielding was taken as the failure
   threshold, and the maximum settlement displacement under which PE pipe
   serves safely was analyzed. With increasing length of transition
   section, the settlement displacement for pipe yielding increases, that
   is PE pipe with longer length of transition section is safer than those
   with shorter one under the same settlement displacement. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The interactions between trivalent or pentavalent As/Sb and dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) in four regions (the river channel, the adjacent
   coastal area, and the northern and southern nearshore areas) of the
   Yangtze Estuary, China, were studied using fluorescence quenching
   titration combined with excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy and
   parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The As/Sb-DOM complexation
   characteristics were investigated using FTIR and UV absorbance
   spectroscopy and zeta potential analysis. Four protein-like components
   and one humic-like component were identified in the DOM from the Yangtze
   Estuary, China, by PARAFAC analysis. The tryptophan-like substance
   represented by component 2 was the dominant component and played an
   important role in the complexation between DOM and As/Sb. The results of
   complexation modeling demonstrated that the binding capacity of
   trivalent As/Sb with DOM was higher than that of pentavalent As/Sb with
   DOM. The DOM from the north nearshore area with the most acidic
   functional groups and greatest aromaticity possessed the highest binding
   capacity for trivalent and pentavalent As/Sb. The increase in the UV
   absorbance and the charge neutralization further indicated the
   interaction between As/Sb and DOM. The higher binding capacity of
   Sb(III) with DOM was mainly due to the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Our
   study demonstrates that the use of the advanced EEM-PARAFAC method in
   fluorescence quenching studies is very useful for evaluating the
   properties of DOM-pollutant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Copper-coated aluminum wires exhibit good electrical conductivity, high
   thermal conductivity, low contact resistance of copper and low density,
   and provide economic advantages over aluminum. However, there are some
   problems in the manufacturing processes of hot-dip copper-coated
   aluminum wires, such as the difficulties in controlling coating process.
   In this work, the hot-dip copper-coating method of aluminum wires was
   investigated for producing copper-coated aluminum wire composites. The
   interface microstructure between the aluminum wire and the copper
   coating layer was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Five different fluxing
   agents were tested. Experimental results show that appropriate
   conditions for the hot-dip process are determined as the liquid copper
   temperature of 1085A degrees C and the treatment time less than 1 s. A
   success in hot-dip copper-coated aluminum wires is achieved by
   hot-dipping a low-melting-point metal into a high-melting-point metal
   liquid, which is significant for the further development and application
   of copper-coated aluminum wire composites.}},

Abstract = {{To overcome the detrimental effects of liquid environments on
   microelectromechanical systems resonator performance, the in-fluid
   vibration of a novel disk resonator supported by two electrothermally
   driven legs is investigated through analytical modeling and the effects
   of the system's geometric/material parameters on the dynamic response
   are explored. The all-shear interaction device (ASID) is based on
   engaging the surrounding fluid primarily through shearing action. The
   theory comprises a continuous-system, multimodal model, and a
   single-degree-of-freedom model, the latter yielding simple formulas for
   the fundamental-mode resonant characteristics that often furnish
   excellent estimates to the results based on the more general model.
   Comparisons between theoretical predictions and previously published
   liquid-phase quality factor (Q) data (silicon devices in heptane) show
   that the theoretical results capture the observed trends and also give
   very good quantitative estimates, particularly for the highest Q
   devices. Moreover, the highest Q value measured in the earlier study
   (304) corresponded to a specimen whose disk radius-to-thickness ratio
   was 2.5, a value that compares well with the optimal value of 2.3
   predicted by the present model. The insight furnished by the proposed
   theory is expected to lead to further improvements in ASID design to
   achieve unprecedented levels of performance for a wide variety of
   liquid-phase resonator applications. {[}2014-0253]}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Neural interface technologies could provide controlling
   connections between the nervous system and external technologies, such
   as limb prosthetics. The recording of efferent, motor potentials is a
   critical requirement for a peripheral neural interface, as these signals
   represent the user-generated neural output intended to drive external
   devices. Our objective was to evaluate structural and functional neural
   regeneration through a microchannel neural interface and to characterize
   potentials recorded from electrodes placed within the microchannels in
   awake and behaving animals. Approach. Female rats were implanted with
   muscle EMG electrodes and, following unilateral sciatic nerve
   transection, the cut nerve was repaired either across a microchannel
   neural interface or with end-to-end surgical repair. During a 13 week
   recovery period, direct muscle responses to nerve stimulation proximal
   to the transection were monitored weekly. In two rats repaired with the
   neural interface, four wire electrodes were embedded in the
   microchannels and recordings were obtained within microchannels during
   proximal stimulation experiments and treadmill locomotion. Main results.
   In these proof-of-principle experiments, we found that axons from cut
   nerves were capable of functional reinnervation of distal muscle
   targets, whether regenerating through a microchannel device or after
   direct end-to-end repair. Discrete stimulation-evoked and volitional
   potentials were recorded within interface microchannels in a small group
   of awake and behaving animals and their firing patterns correlated
   directly with intramuscular recordings during locomotion. Of 38
   potentials extracted, 19 were identified as motor axons reinnervating
   tibialis anterior or soleus muscles using spike triggered averaging.
   Significance. These results are evidence for motor axon regeneration
   through microchannels and are the first report of in vivo recordings
   from regenerated motor axons within microchannels in a small group of
   awake and behaving animals. These unique findings provide preliminary
   evidence that efferent, volitional motor potentials can be recorded from
   the microchannel-based peripheral neural interface; a critical
   requirement for any neural interface intended to facilitate direct
   neural control of external technologies.}},

   4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer salts
   stabilized influenza vaccine, surfactants had little effect during
   drying, drying temperature had weak effects on vaccine stability, and
   drying on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) led to increased stability
   compared with drying on stainless steel. A number of excipients, mostly
   polysaccharides and some amino acids, further stabilized the influenza
   vaccine during drying. Over longer time scales of storage, combinations
   of stabilizers preserved the most vaccine activity. Finally, dissolving
   microneedle patches formulated with arginine and calcium heptagluconate
   had no significant activity loss for all three strains of seasonal
   influenza vaccine during storage at room temperature for 6 months. We
   conclude that appropriately formulated microneedle patches can exhibit
   remarkable thermostability that could enable storage and distribution of
   influenza vaccine outside the cold chain. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Automatic Horizontal Curve Identification and Measurement Method Using
   GPS Data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Horizontal curves play a critical role in roadway safety by providing a
   smooth transition between tangent sections. Because radii of horizontal
   curves are one of the most fundamental elements in roadway geometry
   design, transportation agencies, e.g., state DOTs, need to measure them
   to support network-level safety analysis. However, the traditional
   methods that are commonly used by transportation agencies, e.g., plan
   sheet reading method and chord-offset method, are time consuming, labor
   intensive, and inaccurate. Although some semiautomatic and automatic
   methods have been developed using global positioning system (GPS) data
   and/or geographic information system (GIS) functions in recent years,
   these methods are not yet ready to be practically used in a
   network-level analysis because they either require intensive manual
   intervention or lack of the capability in automatically identifying
   complex curves. This study is aimed to develop a new method using widely
   available GPS data that can automatically identify all types of
   horizontal curves and measure the corresponding curve radii, including
   the most challenging spiral curve. The simulation test using 385
   synthetic horizontal curves shows that the proposed method can correctly
   identify 90.1\% of the tested curves and can accurately classify 87.3\%
   of the detected curves types. The field test shows that the proposed
   method can correctly identify all of the 25 tested curves and can
   accurately measure the corresponding radii. The results from an
   experimental test clearly demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of
   the proposed method. A case study on Interstate 285 demonstrates that
   proposed method is a promising method for transportation agencies to
   achieve reliable and efficient network-level analysis. (C) 2014 American

Title = {{Risk-Based Planning in Transportation Asset Management: Critical
   Pitfalls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The 2012 transportation bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
   Century, formalizes the application of risk management in transportation
   asset management decision making. The bill requires departments of
   transportation to have a formal risk management plan for the national
   highway system. When carried out successfully, risk planning can be a
   very powerful framework to effectively and efficiently manage
   transportation infrastructure. However, if there is lack of experience
   with and insight into risk planning, it can go wrong, leading to a
   counterproductive plan that contributes to ineffectiveness and
   inefficiencies in the organization and transportation system and to
   wasted resources. This paper reviews a broad spectrum of literature on
   risk methods and applications to identify and discuss some common
   pitfalls-failure to communicate, failure to monitor, proportionality,
   failure to involve knowledgeable individuals. It synthesizes the results
   for purposeful use in transportation asset management decision making.
   The literature review indicates that pitfalls are pervasive and usually
   familiar to the new generation of industries adopting the principles of
   risk in their management practices. Accordingly, the paper recommends
   that decision makers and analysts become more familiar with these
   pitfalls before embarking on risk implementation programs. (C) 2014

Title = {{Characterization of cardiac quiescence from retrospective cardiac
   computed tomography using a correlation-based phase-to-phase deviation
   measure}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Accurate knowledge of cardiac quiescence is crucial to the
   performance of many cardiac imaging modalities, including computed
   tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). To accurately quantify
   quiescence, a method for detecting the quiescent periods of the heart
   from retrospective cardiac computed tomography (CT) using a
   correlation-based, phase-to-phase deviation measure was developed.
   Methods: Retrospective cardiac CT data were obtained from 20 patients
   (11 male, 9 female, 33-74 yr) and the left main, left anterior
   descending, left circumflex, right coronary artery (RCA), and
   interventricular septum (IVS) were segmented for each phase using a
   semiautomated technique. Cardiac motion of individual coronary vessels
   as well as the IVS was calculated using phase-to-phase deviation. As an
   easily identifiable feature, the IVS was analyzed to assess how well it
   predicts vessel quiescence. Finally, the diagnostic quality of the
   reconstructed volumes from the quiescent phases determined using the
   deviation measure from the vessels in aggregate and the IVS was compared
   to that from quiescent phases calculated by the CT scanner. Three
   board-certified radiologists, fellowship-trained in cardiothoracic
   imaging, graded the diagnostic quality of the reconstructions using a
   Likert response format: 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = adequate, 4 =
   nondiagnostic.
   Results: Systolic and diastolic quiescent periods were identified for
   each subject from the vessel motion calculated using the phase-to-phase
   deviation measure. The motion of the IVS was found to be similar to the
   aggregate vessel (AGG) motion. The diagnostic quality of the coronary
   vessels for the quiescent phases calculated from the aggregate vessel
   (P-AGG) and IVS (P-IVS) deviation signal using the proposed methods was
   comparable to the quiescent phases calculated by the CT scanner (P-CT).
   The one exception was the RCA, which improved for P-AGG for 18 of the 20
   subjects when compared to P-CT (P-CT = 2.48; P-AGG = 2.07, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: A method for quantifying the motion of specific coronary
   vessels using a correlation-based, phase-to-phase deviation measure was
   developed and tested on 20 patients receiving cardiac CT exams. The IVS
   was found to be a suitable predictor of vessel quiescence. The
   diagnostic quality of the quiescent phases detected by the proposed
   methods was comparable to those calculated by the CT scanner. The
   ability to quantify coronary vessel quiescence from the motion of the
   IVS can be used to develop new CTCA gating techniques and quantify the
   resulting potential improvement in CTCA image quality. (C) 2015 American

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the current pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP)
   workforce and to investigate the impact of potential policy changes to
   address forecasted shortages.
   METHODS: We modeled the admission of students into nursing bachelor's
   programs and followed them through advanced clinical programs.
   Prediction models were combined with optimal decision-making to
   determine best-case scenario admission levels. We computed 2 measures:
   (1) the absolute shortage and (2) the expected number of years until the
   PNP workforce will be able to fully satisfy PNP demand (ie,
   self-sufficiency).
   RESULTS: There is a forecasted shortage of PNPs in the workforce over
   the next 13 years. Under the best-case scenario, it would take at least
   13 years for the workforce to fully satisfy demand. Our analysis of
   potential policy changes revealed that increasing the specialization
   rate for PNPs by 4\% would decrease the number of years required until
   there are enough PNPs from 13 years to 5 years. Increasing the
   certification examination passing rate to 96\% from the current average
   of 86.9\% would lead to self-sufficiency in 11 years. In addition,
   increasing the annual growth rate of master's programs to 36\% from the
   current maximum of 10.7\% would result in self-sufficiency in 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Current forecasts of demand for PNPs indicate that the
   current workforce will be incapable of satisfying the growing demand.
   Policy changes can result in a reduction in the expected shortage and
   potentially improve access to care for pediatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{Agility is important for sport performance and potentially injury risk;
   however, factors affecting this motor skill remain unclear. Here, we
   evaluated the extent to which lower extremity dexterity (LED) and muscle
   performance were associated with agility. Fourteen male and 14 female
   soccer athletes participated. Agility was evaluated using a hopping
   sequence separately with both limbs and with the dominant limb only. The
   LED test evaluated the athletes' ability to dynamically regulate
   foot-ground interactions by compressing a spring prone to buckling with
   the lower limb. Muscle performance included hip and knee isometric
   strength and vertical jump height. Correlation analyses were used to
   assess the associations between muscle performance, LED, and agility.
   Multiple regression models were used to determine whether linear
   associations differed between sexes. On average, the female athletes
   took longer to complete the agility tasks than the male athletes. This
   difference could not be explained by muscle performance. Conversely, LED
   was found to be the primary determinant of agility (double limb:
   R-2=0.61, P<0.001; single limb: R-2=0.63, P<0.001). Our findings suggest
   that the sensorimotor ability to dynamically regulate foot-ground
   interactions as assessed by the LED test is predictive of agility in
   soccer athletes. We propose that LED may have implications for sport
   performance, injury risk, and rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{A connected dominating set (CDS) is used as a virtual backbone (VB) for
   efficient routing and broadcasting in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
   Currently, almost all existing works focus on constructing minimum-sized
   CDS under the deterministic network model. However, because of the
   existence of many probabilistic lossy links in WSNs, it is more
   practical to obtain a VB under the realistic probabilistic network model
   (PNM). Moreover, load-balance factor cannot be neglected when
   constructing a VB to prolong network lifetime. Hence, in this paper, we
   propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm to construct a load-balanced
   VB under PNM. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed
   methods extend network lifetime by 69\% on average compared with the
   existing state-of-the-art approaches. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Scaling turbulent flame speeds of negative Markstein length fuel blends

Pages = {{375-387}},

Abstract = {{This work describes analyses of turbulent flame speeds, S-T, of negative
   Markstein length fuel blends using leading point models. One implication
   of these models is that the maximum laminar burning velocity, S-L,S-max,
   of highly stretched flames or ``critically stretched flames{''}, is the
   appropriate flame speed scale with which to parameterize the turbulent
   flame speed. More specifically, it leads to a scaling approach for the
   turbulent flame speed of the form S-T/S-L,S-max = f (<
   u'(rms)>(LP)/S-L,S-max , tau(SL,max)/tau(flow)), where tau(SL,max) and
   tau(flow) are the chemical time-scale associated with the leading point
   and a characteristic fluid mechanical time-scale, respectively. In this
   paper, we apply these scalings to data sets from the literature which
   explore pressure and fuel composition effects on S. Amongst these data
   sets are new measurements, acquired by our group, of S-T,S-GC for H-2/CO
   mixtures at pressures up to 20 atm. It is shown that this approach can
   scale turbulent burning velocities from a range of different data sets,
   with significantly different fuel compositions, pressures, and
   stoichiometries. This result is particularly significant in
   understanding the strong pressure effects manifested in these data.
   Nonetheless, we also emphasize that time-scale, length scale, and
   Reynolds number effects on these correlations are difficult to
   differentiate as they exhibit similar pressure sensitivities, and
   further work is needed to conclusively understand the coupled (and very
   strong) effects of mixture stretch sensitivity and pressure on turbulent
   burning velocities. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{We study tandem queueing systems with finite buffers in which servers

   that she/he is assigned to, we show that any nonidling policy where all
   servers work in teams of two or more at all times is optimal. On the
   other hand, when the server abilities are task-dependent, we show that
   for Markovian systems with two stations and two servers, depending on
   the synergy among the servers, the optimal policy either assigns the two
   servers to different stations when possible, or lets them work in a team
   at all times. Finally, for larger Markovian systems, we provide
   sufficient conditions that guarantee that the optimal policy has all
   servers working together at all times.}},

Abstract = {{A fully-integrated near-field wireless transceiver has been presented
   for simultaneous data and power transmission across inductive links,
   which operates based on pulse delay modulation (PDM) technique. PDM is a
   low-power carrier-less modulation scheme that offers wide bandwidth
   along with robustness against strong power carrier interference, which
   makes it suitable for implantable neuroprosthetic devices, such as
   retinal implants. To transmit each bit, a pattern of narrow pulses are
   generated at the same frequency of the power carrier across the
   transmitter (Tx) data coil with specific time delays to initiate
   decaying ringing across the tuned receiver (Rx) data coil. This ringing
   shifts the zero-crossing times of the undesired power carrier
   interference on the Rx data coil, resulting in a phase shift between the
   signals across Rx power and data coils, from which the data bit stream
   can be recovered. A PDM transceiver prototype was fabricated in a
   0.35-mu m standard CMOS process, occupying 1.6 mm(2). The transceiver
   achieved a measured 13.56 Mbps data rate with a raw bit error rate (BER)
   of 4.3 X 10(-7) at 10 mm distance between figure-8 data coils, despite a
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of -18.5 dB across the Rx data coil.
   At the same time, a class-D power amplifier, operating at 13.56 MHz,
   delivered 42 mW of regulated power across a separate pair of high-Q
   power coils, aligned with the data coils. The PDM data Tx and Rx power
   consumptions were 960 pJ/bit and 162 pJ/bit, respectively, at 1.8 V
   supply voltage.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is the most promising converter
   topology for medium-and high-power applications. One of the main
   concerns in the operation of the MMC, particularly for high-power

   Carbide (SiC)-based devices have the potential to provide significant
   efficiency improvement compared with silicon devices. However, the
   possibility and impact of using SiC-based devices instead of silicon
   devices for high-power conversion have not been thoroughly explored.
   This paper reports on the results obtained from a detailed study to
   evaluate the performance of MMCs based on medium-voltage SiC MOSFETs and
   diodes with hybrid MMCs that employ silicon IGBTs and SiC diodes. The
   results are based on detailed circuit simulations that use simple

   paper analyzes its charging behavior together with a load capacitor.
   Through numerical and analytical modeling, the charging performance of a

   is completely analogous to that of a dc voltage source in series with an
   internal resistance. An optimum load capacitance that matches the TENGs
   impedance is observed for the maximum stored energy. This optimum load
   capacitance is theoretically detected to be linearly proportional to the
   charging cycle numbers and the inherent TENG capacitance. Experiments

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become the most promising
   converter technology for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission
   systems. However, similar to any other voltage-sourced converter-based
   HVDC system, MMC-HVDC systems with the half-bridge submodules (SMs) lack
   the capability of handling dc-side short-circuit faults, which are of
   severe concern for overhead transmission lines. In this paper, two new
   SM circuit configurations as well as a hybrid design methodology to
   embed the dc-fault-handling capability in the MMC-HVDC systems are
   proposed. By combining the features of various SM configurations, the
   dc-fault current path through the freewheeling diodes is eliminated and
   the dc-fault current is enforced to zero. Several MMC configurations
   based on the proposed hybrid design method and various SM circuits, that
   is, the half-bridge, the full-bridge, the clamp-double, and the
   five-level cross-connected SMs, as well as the newly proposed
   unipolar-voltage full-bridge and three-level cross-connected SMs, are
   investigated and compared in terms of the dc-fault-handing capability,
   semiconductor power losses, and component requirements. The studies are
   carried out based on time-domain simulation in the PSCAD/EMTDC software
   environment for various SM configurations and dc-fault conditions. The
   reported study results demonstrate the proposed hybrid-designed MMC-HVDC
   system based on the combination of the half-bridge and the proposed SM
   circuits is the optimal design among all evaluated systems in terms of
   the dc-fault-handing capability, semiconductor power losses, and
   component requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A finite strain nonlinear viscoplastic constitutive model for
   polyurethane (PU)-Montmorillonite clay (MTM) nanocomposites is developed
   with the goal of characterizing the mechanical response under different
   strain rates and strain amplitudes. In this model, both the elastic and
   viscous responses are considered to be nonlinear. It is shown that a
   simple mathematical extension of the model used to characterize the PU
   determines the nonlinear material constants for the PU-MTM. A finite
   deformation nonlinear viscoelastic model is used to represent the
   mechanical behavior of PU. The rate dependent viscous behavior and
   multiple relaxation times present in the PU response are determined
   using the frequency dependent tan delta measurements from Dynamic
   Mechanical Analysis (DMA). The model is capable of accurately capturing
   both the rate dependent behavior and frequency dependent damping of PU.
   The entire rate dependent hysteresis behavior (loading-unloading) is
   predicted accurately through the constitutive model for strains up to
   10\%. For the PU-MTM nanocomposite, the constitutive stress update is
   implemented in a finite element (ABAQUS/Explicit) framework and
   validated using a range of experimental results. The model predictions
   show excellent agreement with experimental results in capturing rate
   dependent loading/unloading responses for both PU and PU-MTM
   nanocomposites. The proposed model can easily be extended to
   characterize other polyurethane based nanocomposites. Published by

Abstract = {{With the goal of thermal expansion control, the synthesis and properties
   of Sc1-xAlxF3 were investigated. The solubility limit of AlF3 in ScF3 at
   similar to 1340 K is similar to 50\%. Solid solutions (x <= 0.50) were
   characterized by synchrotron powder diffraction at ambient pressure
   between 100 and 900 K and at pressures < 0.414 GPa while heating from
   298 to 523 K. A phase transition from cubic to rhombohedral is observed.
   The transition temperature increases smoothly with Al3+ content,
   approaching 500 K at the solid solubility limit, and also upon
   compression at fixed Al3+ content. The slope of the pressure-temperature
   phase boundary is similar to 0.5 K MPa-1, which is steep relative to
   that for most symmetry-lowering phase transitions in perovskites. The
   volume coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for the rhombohedral phase
   is strongly positive, but the cubic-phase CTE varies from negative (x <
   0.15) to near-zero (x = 0.15) to positive (x > 0.20) between similar to
   600 and 800 K. The cubic solid solutions elastically stiffen on heating,
   while Al3+ substitution causes softening at a given temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{Voice-based biometric security systems involving only neutral speech
   have achieved promising performance. However, the speakers are very
   likely to fail the recognition when the test data exhibit multiple
   emotions. This paper aimed to address the mismatch of the emotional
   states between training and testing speech. We discuss different
   modeling strategies that incorporate the emotions (affects) of speakers
   into the training stage of a Mandarin-based speaker recognition system
   and propose an alternative approach, which could optimize the
   utilization of the limited affective speech. The training speeches are
   partitioned and clustered by the trends of the prosodic variations.
   Multiple models are built based on the clustered speech for a given
   speaker. The prosodic differences are characterized by a combination of
   features that describe the changes of the fundamental frequencies and
   energy contours. The experiments were carried out based on the Mandarin
   Affective Speech Corpus. The result shows 73.37 \% improvement in
   recognition rate over that of the traditional speaker verification tasks
   relatively and also achieves 63.53 \% higher in performance over the
   structural training-based systems relatively.}},

Abstract = {{We present analyses to provide a generalized rheological equation for
   suspensions and emulsions of non-Brownian particles. These multiparticle
   systems are subjected to a steady straining flow at low Reynolds number.
   We first consider the effect of a single deformable fluid particle on
   the ambient velocity and stress fields to constrain the rheological
   behavior of dilute mixtures. In the homogenization process, we introduce
   a first volume correction by considering a finite domain for the
   incompressible matrix. We then extend the solution for the rheology of
   concentrated system using an incremental differential method operating
   in a fixed and finite volume, where we account for the effective volume
   of particles through a crowding factor. This approach provides a
   self-consistent method to approximate hydrodynamic interactions between
   bubbles, droplets, or solid particles in concentrated systems. The
   resultant non-linear model predicts the relative viscosity over particle
   volume fractions ranging from dilute to the the random close packing in
   the limit of small deformation (capillary or Weissenberg numbers) for
   any viscosity ratio between the dispersed and continuous phases. The
   predictions from our model are tested against published datasets and
   other constitutive equations over different ranges of viscosity ratio,
   volume fraction, and shear rate. These comparisons show that our model,
   is in excellent agreement with published datasets. Moreover, comparisons
   with experimental data show that the model performs very well when
   extrapolated to high capillary numbers (C aa parts per thousand << 1).
   We also predict the existence of two dimensionless numbers; a critical
   viscosity ratio and critical capillary numbers that characterize
   transitions in the macroscopic rheological behavior of emulsions.
   Finally, we present a regime diagram in terms of the viscosity ratio and
   capillary number that constrains conditions where emulsions behave like
   Newtonian or Non-Newtonian fluids.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease of the joint for which current
   treatments are unsatisfactory, thus motivating development of tissue
   engineering (TE)-based therapies. To date, TE strategies have had some
   success, developing replacement tissue constructs with biochemical
   properties approaching that of native cartilage. However, poor
   biomechanical properties and limited postimplantation integration with
   surrounding tissue are major shortcomings that need to be addressed.
   Functional tissue engineering strategies that apply physiologically
   relevant biophysical cues provide a platform to improve TE constructs
   before implantation. In the previous decade, new experimental and
   theoretical findings in cartilage biomechanics and electromechanics have
   emerged, resulting in an increased understanding of the complex
   interplay of multiple biophysical cues in the extracellular matrix of
   the tissue. The effect of biophysical stimulation on cartilage, and the
   resulting chondrocyte-mediated biosynthesis, remodeling, degradation,
   and repair, has, therefore, been extensively explored by the TE
   community. This article compares and contrasts the cellular response of
   chondrocytes to multiple biophysical stimuli, and may be read in
   conjunction with its companion paper that compares and contrasts the
   subsequent intracellular signal transduction cascades. Mechanical,
   magnetic, and electrical stimuli promote proliferation, differentiation,
   and maturation of chondrocytes within established dose parameters or
   ``biological windows.{''} This knowledge will provide a framework for
   ongoing studies incorporating multiple biophysical cues in TE functional
   neocartilage for treatment of OA.}},

Abstract = {{The unique mechanoelectrochemical environment of cartilage has motivated
   researchers to investigate the effect of multiple biophysical cues,
   including mechanical, magnetic, and electrical stimulation, on
   chondrocyte biology. It is well established that biophysical stimuli
   promote chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and maturation
   within ``biological windows{''} of defined dose parameters, including
   mode, frequency, magnitude, and duration of stimuli (see companion
   review Part I: Cellular Response). However, the underlying molecular
   mechanisms and signal transduction pathways activated in response to
   multiple biophysical stimuli remain to be elucidated. Understanding the
   mechanisms of biophysical signal transduction will deepen knowledge of
   tissue organogenesis, remodeling, and regeneration and aiding in the
   treatment of pathologies such as osteoarthritis. Further, this knowledge
   will provide the tissue engineer with a potent toolset to manipulate and
   control cell fate and subsequently develop functional replacement
   cartilage. The aim of this article is to review chondrocyte signal
   transduction pathways in response to mechanical, magnetic, and
   electrical cues. Signal transduction does not occur along a single
   pathway; rather a number of parallel pathways appear to be activated,
   with calcium signaling apparently common to all three types of stimuli,
   though there are different modes of activation. Current tissue
   engineering strategies, such as the development of ``smart{''}
   functionalized biomaterials that enable the delivery of growth factors
   or integration of conjugated nanoparticles, may further benefit from
   targeting known signal transduction pathways in combination with
   external biophysical cues.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-Syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) is a member of a family of cell surface
   proteoglycans, which has been reported to participate in the regulation
   of events relevant to tissue repair and chronic injury responses,
   including cell-substrate interactions, matrix remodeling, and cell
   migration. In this study, we report the functional significance of Sdc-1
   in polarized macrophage populations and its role in adhesion and
   motility events relevant to resolution of the inflammatory program.
   Approach and Results-Macrophage Sdc-1 expression is associated with
   differentiated M2 macrophages with high intrinsic motility, and Sdc-1
   deficiency is characterized by impaired migration and enhanced adhesion.
   Leukocyte infiltration and emigration were examined in a
   thioglycollate-induced model of peritonitis in Sdc-1(+/+) and Sdc-1(-/-)
   mice. Although the infiltration of inflammatory cells was similar in
   both cohorts, a significant delay in the lymphatic clearance of
   Sdc1(-/-) macrophages was observed. Moreover, we observed enhanced
   inflammation and greater burden of atherosclerotic plaques in
   ApoE(-/-)Sdc-1(-/-) mice maintained on a Western diet.
   Conclusions-These results demonstrate that defective motility in
   Sdc-1(-/-) macrophages promotes a persistent inflammatory state with
   relevance to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cloud-based design manufacturing (CBDM) refers to a service-oriented
   networked product development model in which service consumers are
   enabled to configure, select, and utilize customized product realization
   resources and services ranging from computer-aided engineering software
   to reconfigurable manufacturing systems. An ongoing debate on CBDM in
   the research community revolves around several aspects such as
   definitions, key characteristics, computing architectures, communication
   and collaboration processes, crowdsourcing processes, information and
   communication infrastructure, programming models, data storage, and new
   business models pertaining to CBDM. One question, in particular, has
   often been raised: is cloud-based design and manufacturing actually a
   new paradigm, or is it just ``old wine in new bottles{''}? To answer
   this question, we discuss and compare the existing definitions for CBDM,
   identify the essential characteristics of CBDM, define a systematic
   requirements checklist that an idealized CBDM system should satisfy, and
   compare CBDM to other relevant but more traditional collaborative design
   and distributed manufacturing systems such as web- and agent-based
   design and manufacturing systems. To justify the conclusion that CBDM
   can be considered as a new paradigm that is anticipated to drive digital
   manufacturing and design innovation, we present the development of a
   smart delivery drone as an idealized CBDM example scenario and propose a
   corresponding CBDM system architecture that incorporates CBDM-based
   design processes, integrated manufacturing services, information and
   supply chain management in a holistic sense. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we formulate the problem of keyword spotting as a
   non-uniform error automatic speech recognition (ASR) problem and propose
   a model training methodology based on the non-uniform minimum
   classification error (MCE) approach. The main idea is to adapt the
   fundamental MCE criteria to reflect the cost-sensitive notion in that
   errors on keywords are much more significant than errors on non-keywords
   in an automatic speech recognition task. The notion of cost sensitivity
   leads to emphasis of keyword models in parameter optimization. Then we
   present a system which takes advantage of the weighted finite-state
   transducer (WFST) framework to efficiently implement the non-uniform
   MCE. To enhance the approach of non-uniform error cost minimization for
   keyword spotting, we further formulate a technique called ``adaptive
   boosted non-uniform MCE{''} which incorporates the idea of boosting. We
   validate the proposed framework on two challenging large-scale
   spontaneous conversational telephone speech (CTS) datasets in two
   different languages (English and Mandarin). Experimental results show
   our framework can achieve consistent and significant spotting
   performance gains over both the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
   baseline and conventional discriminatively-trained systems with uniform

Title = {{Investment Valuation Model for Renewable Energy Systems in Buildings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Transformative technologies for producing renewable energy have
   promising features for substantial reductions in carbon emissions and
   environmental footprints of the building sector. Investments in
   renewable energy systems require substantial implementation costs
   followed by a long period of recovering the invested capital through
   savings in utilities bills. Favorable timing of renewable energy system
   implementation can reduce capital expenses and enhance returns on
   investments. An appropriate investment valuation method is needed to
   identify the appropriate time to implement any given renewable energy
   system and to find the values of properly scheduled investments. Real
   options analysis provides the ability to cope with investment timing
   under uncertainty. However, current real options models are
   theoretically limited in the context of decision making about
   investments in building energy improvements. In this paper, the writers
   address the theoretical limitations of current real options models and
   create a new real options model to evaluate investment options for
   renewable energy systems under uncertainty. This theoretically
   well-founded and practically useful model is tailored to the context of
   investment decision making for building energy improvements. The primary
   contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the creation
   of (1) a method to account for uncertainty about energy savings
   following the implementation of renewable energy systems in buildings;
   (2) a novel method to estimate the volatility of renewable energy
   projects subject to uncertainty; and (3) an investment valuation
   approach to identifying the best time to implement renewable energy
   systems in buildings and to determine the corresponding investment
   option value. It is expected that this work will contribute to the
   construction engineering and management global community by presenting a
   new class of investment assessment tools that help in making hard energy
   investment decisions and will therefore increase the likelihood of
   achieving ambitious goals for the adoption of renewable energy systems.

Title = {{Estimation of supercapacitor energy using a linear capacitance for
   applications in wireless sensor networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Volume = {{275}},
Pages = {{498-505}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitor-based energy storage systems have been developed for many
   applications. For wireless sensor network applications, supercapacitor
   energy is a critical parameter for system design and power management.
   However, estimation of supercapacitor energy using the rated capacitance
   may result in a significant error. To reduce the error, this paper
   proposes to use a linear capacitance for supercapacitor energy
   estimation based on the supercapacitor physics. A linear capacitance
   composed of a constant capacitance and a voltage-dependent capacitance
   is determined by conducting a constant power charge or discharge test.
   Evaluation results for a variety of supercapacitor samples with
   different rated capacitance and voltage demonstrate that using the
   proposed linear capacitance is more accurate than using the rated
   capacitance to estimate supercapacitor energy. Moreover, the results
   show that using the linear capacitance determined through a high power
   charge experiment can minimize the energy estimation error. This
   observation can serve as a guideline to design the experiment in a way
   that the determined linear capacitance results in the minimum
   supercapacitor energy estimation error. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The disadvantages of cobalt-based and barium-based perovskite oxides in
   solid oxide fuel cells are the large thermal expansion coefficients, low
   structure stability, and poor CO2 tolerance, although they have
   excellent oxygen reduction activity. To reduce the impact of these
   detrimental effects, cobalt-free La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-delta (LBFZ) was
   investigated as a potentially promising cathode material for
   intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). The TEC of
   LBFZ is 18.9 x 10(-6) IC-1, which is lower than other widely used
   cobalt-containing cathode materials. The electrode performance can be
   further improved by incorporating Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) to form a
   composite. Systematic study suggests that composite cathodes containing
   40 wt\% SDC exhibited the best electrode performance (R-p = 0.12 Omega
   cm(2)) when they were fired at 1050 degrees C for 2 h, correlating to a
   peak power density of 839 mW cm(-2) based on the single cell with the
   configuration NiO-YSZ/YSZ/SDC/LBFZ-SDC at 700 degrees C. Also, LBFZ SDC
   demonstrated excellent chemical stability upon exposure to 1\% CO2 at
   550 C for 100 h, and the electrochemical testing also demonstrated
   better CO2 tolerance than Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta(BSCF). These
   results suggest that LBFZ and its SDC composite are promising cathode
   materials for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ion exchange of nanoporous (e.g., zeolite) membranes is of increasing
   importance in their applications as separation devices and catalytic
   reactors. Ion exchange processes in zeolite membranes are significantly
   limited by slow hydrated-ion transport rates and the low liquid-solid
   interfacial area available in comparison to ion exchange of zeolites in
   powdered form, thereby leading to long membrane processing and
   regeneration times. Here, we consider ion exchange processes in zeolite
   membranes in more detail, and show the much higher efficacy of a
   vacuum-assisted liquid-vapor `flow-through' method in comparison to both
   the conventional `immersion/counter-diffusion' method as well as a
   liquid-liquid flow-through method. Na-MFI zeolite disk membranes, made
   by both in situ and seeded growth, were ion-exchanged with Ga3+, Zn2+,
   and Pt2+ ions in the temperature range of 23-70 degrees C and exchange
   times of 5-24 h. The penetration of these ions into the zeolite
   membranes was investigated in detail by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
   spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the quantity of exchanged ions in the
   membranes via the vacuum-assisted `flow-through' technique is found to
   exceed that achieved by the other two methods by up to a factor of ten,
   with the liquid-liquid technique being the least efficient. Higher
   temperatures and longer ion exchange times increased the ion exchange
   efficiency in the vacuum-assisted method. Chemical analysis of the
   condensed permeate solution by inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) mass
   spectrometry revealed that both the original Na+ and replacement metal
   cations moved through the membrane in a co-current manner, unlike the
   conventional counter-current movement of ions in the immersion process.
   The Na+ ions in the membrane experience pressure-driven transport (along
   with water molecules) to the permeate side, and leave the membrane
   surface as hydrated vapor-phase cations, thereby allowing the
   maintenance of a high driving force for ion exchange. In contrast, the
   conventional counter-current flow technique leads to a decreasing
   concentration driving force with time. The liquid-liquid method, even
   though having the same ion concentration and applied pressure driving
   force as the liquid-vapor method, is very slow because of the large
   osmotic gradient opposing the permeation of ions and water from the feed
   to the permeate side. The liquid-vapor ion exchanged MFI membranes
   showed excellent integrity (as determined by H-2 and CO2 permeation
   measurements). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Sparsity-Inducing Optimization-Based Algorithm for Planar Patches
   Extraction from Noisy Point-Cloud Data}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Currently, much of the manual labor needed to generate as-built building
   information models (BIMs) of existing facilities is spent converting raw
   point cloud data sets (PCDs) to BIM descriptions. Automating the PCD
   conversion process can drastically reduce the cost of generating
   as-built BIMs. Due to the widespread existence of planar structures in
   civil infrastructures, detecting and extracting planar patches from raw
   PCDs is a fundamental step in the conversion pipeline from PCDs to BIMs.
   However, existing methods cannot effectively address both automatically
   detecting and extracting planar patches from infrastructure PCDs. The
   existing methods cannot resolve the problem due to the large scale and
   model complexity of civil infrastructure, or due to the requirements of
   extra constraints or known information. To address the problem, this
   article presents a novel framework for automatically detecting and
   extracting planar patches from large-scale and noisy raw PCDs. The
   proposed method automatically detects planar structures, estimates the
   parametric plane models, and determines the boundaries of the planar
   patches. The first step recovers existing linear dependence
   relationships amongst points in the PCD by solving a group-sparsity
   inducing optimization problem. Next, a spectral clustering procedure
   based on the recovered linear dependence relationships segments the PCD.
   Then, for each segmented group, model parameters of the extracted planes
   are estimated via singular value decomposition (SVD) and maximum
   likelihood estimation sample consensus (MLESAC). Finally, the -shape
   algorithm detects the boundaries of planar structures based on a
   projection of the data to the planar model. The proposed approach is
   evaluated comprehensively by experiments on two types of PCDs from
   real-world infrastructures, one captured directly by laser scanners and
   the other reconstructed from video using structure-from-motion
   techniques. To evaluate the performance comprehensively, five evaluation
   metrics are proposed which measure different aspects of performance.
   Experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the
   existing methods, in the sense that the method automatically and
   accurately extracts planar patches from large-scaled raw PCDs without
   any extra constraints nor user assistance.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how designers think is core to advancing design methods,
   tools, and outcomes. Engineering researchers have effectively turned to
   cognitive science approaches to studying the engineering design process.
   Empirical methods used for studying designer thinking have included
   verbal protocols, case studies, and controlled experiments. Studies have
   looked at the role of design methods, strategies, tools, environment,
   experience, and group dynamics. Early empirical studies were casual and
   exploratory with loosely defined objectives and informal analysis
   methods. Current studies have become more formal, factor controlled,
   aiming at hypothesis testing, using statistical design of experiments (
   DOE) and analysis methods such as analysis of variations ( ANOVA).
   Popular pursuits include comparison of experts and novices, identifying
   and overcoming fixation, role of analogies, effectiveness of ideation
   methods, and other various tools. This paper first reviews a snapshot of
   the different approaches to study designers and their processes. Once
   the current basis is established, the paper explores directions for
   future or expanded research in this rich and critical area of designer
   thinking. A variety of data may be collected, and related to both the
   process and the outcome ( designs). But there are still no standards for
   designing, collecting and analyzing data, partly due to the lack of
   cognitive models and theories of designer thinking. Data analysis is
   tedious and the rate of discoveries has been slow. Future studies may
   need to develop computer based data collection and automated analyses,
   which may facilitate collection of massive amounts of data with the
   potential of rapid advancement of the rate of discoveries and
   development of designer thinking cognitive models. The purpose of this
   paper is to provide a roadmap to the vast literature for the benefit of
   new researchers, and also a retrospective for the community.}},

Abstract = {{This research considers the effects of diffraction, attenuation, and the
   nonlinearity of generating sources on measurements of nonlinear
   ultrasonic Rayleigh wave propagation. A new theoretical framework for
   correcting measurements made with air-coupled and contact piezoelectric
   receivers for the aforementioned effects is provided based on analytical

   measurements. Quantitative experiments are conducted to confirm the
   predictions for the nonlinearity of the piezoelectric source and to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the curve-fitting procedure. These
   experiments are conducted on aluminum 2024 and 7075 specimens and a
   beta(7075)(11)=beta(2024)(11) measure of 1.363 agrees well with previous
   literature and earlier work. The proposed work is also applied to a set
   of 2205 duplex stainless steel specimens that underwent various degrees

Abstract = {{Efficient intracellular delivery of molecules is needed to modulate
   cellular behavior for laboratory and medical applications, but is often
   limited by trade-offs between achieving high intracellular delivery and
   maintaining high cell viability. Here, we studied photoacoustic delivery
   of molecules into cells by exposing DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells
   to nanosecond laser pulses in the presence of carbon black
   nanoparticles. Under strong laser exposure conditions, less than 30\% of
   cells were viable and exhibited uptake. Addition of poloxamer surfactant
   at those laser exposure conditions increased cell viability to almost
   90\%, with intracellular uptake in >80\% of cells. This remarkable
   increase in efficiency of intracellular delivery and cell viability may
   be attributed to enhanced cell membrane resealing by poloxamer
   surfactant after photoacoustic delivery. While F-68 poloxamer was
   effective, the larger, more-hydrophobic F-127 poloxamer provided the
   best results. There was no significant protective effect from addition
   of Ca2+, BAPTAAM, ATP, fetal bovine serum or glycine betaine, which were
   expected to promote active cell membrane repair mechanisms and other
   active intracellular protective processes. We conclude that poloxamer
   surfactant preserves cell viability during photoacoustic delivery of
   molecules into cells, thereby enabling highly efficient intracellular
   delivery. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the size effects of Ag nanowires on thermal
   conductivity and rheological behavior of EG-based suspensions. The
   influences of inclusion concentration and temperature on the
   thermophysical properties of specimens containing three types of Ag
   nanowires were also investigated. It was shown that the measured thermal
   conductivity of EG-based suspensions increased with the rising
   temperature and loading. Besides, the relative enhancement in thermal
   conductivity exhibited a linear relationship with respect to the
   specific surface area of Ag nanowires. A theoretical approach was
   developed to predict the effective thermal conductivity of suspensions
   containing nanowires by introducing liquid layer into account. The Ag
   nanowires/EG interface thermal resistances were extracted from the
   experimental results, which ranged from 2.0 x 10(8) to 5 x 10(8) m(2)
   K/W. Furthermore, a comparative study revealed the excellent performance
   of Ag nanowires used in present work on improving thermal conductivity
   compared with the reported studies. Finally, the presence of Ag
   nanowires with the highest aspect ratio (250) was concluded as the main
   explanation of a noticeable rise in dynamic viscosity and non-Brownian
   fluid behavior of EG-based suspensions at the highest loading (10
   mg/mL). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of depth of cut on the redistribution of residual stress and
   distortion during the milling of thin-walled part}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{216}},
Pages = {{223-233}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The distortion of thin-walled part is significantly affected by the
   residual stress generated after the material is cut away. During this
   process, the relations between the redistributed residual stress and the
   distortion are quite complex; as a result the control of distortion of
   thin-walled part always is being considered tough issues. In this study,
   an approach of optimizing the profile and magnitude of residual stress
   is proposed by analyzing the effects of depth of cut on the
   redistribution of residual stress. Experiments and simulations are
   conducted to compare the cutting forces, temperature and residual
   stress. The results show that, in the roughing, by selection of a
   subsequent depth exceeding prior depth of maximum compressive residual
   stress, the material which contains the main machined residual stress
   can be removed in favor of the subsequent machining. Furthermore, in the
   finishing, different depths of cut are utilized in different cutting
   stages, resulting in smaller magnitude of maximum machined residual
   stress and depth of maximum compressive residual stress. In addition, to
   verify the approach, an aviation thin-walled part is used as the
   experimental object. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of
   distortion and residual stress can be decreased and optimized
   efficiently by controlling and optimizing the depth of cut in the
   roughing and finishing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fidelity of machining simulation models is dependent on the amount
   of micro-scale physics captured in the material constitutive law,
   microstructure evolution law(s), and the unifying scheme integrating
   microstructure evolution into the constitutive law. This paper presents
   a unified material model that explicitly accounts for dislocation and
   microstructure evolution processes as well as dislocation drag as a
   plausible deformation mechanism applicable at the high strain rates
   common, in high speed cutting operations. The unified model is
   calibrated and implemented in the AdvantEdge (TM) 2-D machining
   simulation software and utilized to simulate the orthogonal cutting of
   OFHC Copper. Comparison of the predicted cutting forces with
   experimental data reveals that the model is reasonably accurate. The
   experimentally observed trend of severe grain refinement in OFHC Cu
   chips is predicted quite well by the model. The model was further
   utilized to analyze the evolution of deformation field parameters, i.e.
   plastic strain and the Zener-Hollomon parameter, in orthogonal cutting
   as well as to generate microstructure-deformation maps. The model
   predictions of severe grain refinement in the chip at high plastic
   strains and low Zener-Hollomon parameter values are found to be
   consistent with experimental trends reported in the literature. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In our previous work, a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain for the
   microbial production of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) was constructed
   through modular pathway engineering. In this study, to enhance GlcNAc
   production, glucose feeding approaches and dissolved oxygen (DO) control
   methods in fed-batch culture were systematically investigated. We first
   studied the effects of different glucose feeding strategies, including
   exponential fed-batch culture, pulse fed-batch culture, constant rate
   fed-batch culture, and glucose control (5 g/L, 10 g/L, 15 g/L) fed-batch
   culture, on cell growth and GlcNAc synthesis. We found that GlcNAc
   production in glucose control (5 g/L) fed-batch culture reached 26.58
   g/L, which was 3.10 times that in batch culture. Next, the effect of DO
   level (20\%, 30\%, 40\%, and 50\%) on GlcNAc production was
   investigated, and a step-wise DO control strategy (0-7 h, 30\%; 7-15 h,
   50\%; 15-50 h, 40\%; 50-72 h, 30\%) was introduced. With the optimal
   glucose and DO control strategy, GlcNAc production reached 35.77 g/L,
   which was 4.17 times the production in batch culture without DO control.

   of the patterning is highly improved film thickness variations,
   orientational epitaxy, domain size, and electronic structure. The
   ordering induced by this patterned growth offers a way to take advantage

Abstract = {{Buckypapers are thin sheets produced from Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) that
   effectively transfer the exceptional mechanical properties of CNTs to
   bulk materials. To accomplish a sensible tradeoff between effectiveness
   and efficiency in predicting the mechanical properties of CNT
   buckypapers, a multi-fidelity analysis appears necessary, combining
   costly but high-fidelity physical experiment outputs with affordable but
   low-fidelity Finite Element Analysis (FEA)-based simulation responses.
   Unlike the existing multi-fidelity analysis reported in the literature,
   not all of the input variables in the FEA simulation code are observable
   in the physical experiments; the unobservable ones are the latent
   variables in our multi-fidelity analysis. This article presents a
   formulation for multi-fidelity analysis problems involving latent
   variables and further develops a solution procedure based on nonlinear
   optimization. In a broad sense, this latent variable-involved
   multi-fidelity analysis falls under the category of non-isometric
   matching problems. The performance of the proposed method is compared
   with both a single-fidelity analysis and the existing multi-fidelity
   analysis without considering latent variables, and the superiority of
   the new method is demonstrated, especially when we perform
   extrapolation.}},

Abstract = {{We study a variant of the classical transportation problem in which
   suppliers with limited capacities have a choice of which demands
   (markets) to satisfy. We refer to this problem as the transportation
   problem with market choice (TPMC). While the classical transportation
   problem is known to be strongly polynomial-time solvable, we show that
   its market choice counterpart is strongly NP-complete. For the special
   case when all potential demands are no greater than two, we show that
   the problem reduces in polynomial time to minimum weight perfect
   matching in a general graph, and thus can be solved in polynomial time.
   We give valid inequalities and coefficient update schemes for general
   mixed-integer sets that are substructures of TPMC. Finally, we give
   conditions under which these inequalities define facets, and report our
   preliminary computational experiments with using them in a
   branch-and-cut algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a study of different antenna orientations to
   minimise coupling effects in the radiation patterns of two dipole arrays
   packaged together on multilayer organic (MLO) substrates. These effects
   are evident in the various ripples found in the pattern cuts of the
   arrays. The substrates used in the stack-up are Rogers' RO3003 and
   ULTRALAM3850((R)). The two arrays, at 57 and 80 GHz, are fed together
   through a T-junction. The orientations studied consist of 0 degrees, 45
   degrees and 90 degrees. E- and H-plane patterns were measured for all
   orientations. Significant interference was seen in the E-plane for the 0
   degrees orientation and H-plane for the 90 degrees orientation. This was
   reduced in the 45 degrees orientation, which yielded smoother patterns
   than its respective counterparts in 0 degrees and 90 degrees
   orientations. Adding 5 mm of extra distance in the configurations
   reduced either the amount of ripples (by 0.75 for 57 GHz and 1.75 for 80
   GHz) or their average level (by 0.3 dBi for 57 GHz and 0.785 dBi for 80
   GHz). The gain attained for the designs was >9 dBi and agreed well with
   simulated results. Guidelines for packaged antenna integration for
   mm-wave high speed communications based on the experiments are provided.}},

   retrieval products of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and
   Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) on board the Aqua satellite. The
   results reveal that the sparsity of the fields of temperature is
   relatively pressure independent, while atmospheric humidity and
   geopotential heights are typically sparser at lower and higher pressure
   levels, respectively. We provide evidence that these land-atmospheric
   states can be accurately estimated using a small set of measurements by
   taking advantage of their sparsity prior.}},

Abstract = {{Brown carbon aerosol consists of light-absorbing organic particulate
   matter with wavelength-dependent absorption. Aerosol optical extinction,
   absorption, size distributions, and chemical composition were measured
   in rural Alabama during summer 2013. The field site was well located to
   examine sources of brown carbon aerosol, with influence by high biogenic
   organic aerosol concentrations, pollution from two nearby cities, and
   biomass burning aerosol. We report the optical closure between measured
   dry aerosol extinction at 365nm and calculated extinction from
   composition and size distribution, showing agreement within experiment
   uncertainties. We find that aerosol optical extinction is dominated by
   scattering, with single-scattering albedo values of 0.940.02. Black
   carbon aerosol accounts for 919\% of the total carbonaceous aerosol
   absorption at 365nm, while organic aerosol accounts for 99\%. The
   majority of brown carbon aerosol mass is associated with biomass
   burning, with smaller contributions from biogenically derived secondary
   organic aerosol.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochromic polymers (ECPs) have been shown to be synthetically
   tunable, producing a full palette of vibrantly colored to highly
   transmissive polymers. The development of these colored-to-transmissive
   ECPs employed synthetic design strategies for broad color targeting;
   however, due to the subtleties of color perception and the intricacies
   of polymer structure and color relationships, fine color control is
   difficult. In contrast, color mixing is a well-established practice in
   the printing industry. We have identified three colored-to-transmissive
   switching electrochromic polymers, referred to as ECP-Cyan (ECP-C),
   ECP-Magenta (ECP-M), and ECP-Yellow (ECP-Y), which, via the
   co-processing of multicomponent ECP mixtures, follow the CMY color
   mixing model. The presented work qualitatively assesses the thin film
   characteristics of solution co-processed ECP mixtures. To quantitatively
   determine the predictability of the color properties of ECP mixtures, we
   estimated mass extinction coefficients (epsilon(mass)) from solution
   spectra of the CMY ECPs and compared the estimated and experimentally
   observed color values of blends via a calculated color difference
   (Delta(Eab)). The values of Delta(Eab) range from 8 to 26 across all
   mixture compositions, with an average value of 15, representing a
   reasonable degree of agreement between predicted and observed color
   values. We demonstrate here the ability to co-process ECP mixtures into
   vibrantly colored, visually continuous films and the ability to estimate
   the color properties produced in these mixed ECP films.}},

Abstract = {{We report a straightforward strategy of accessing a wide variety of
   colors through simple predictive color mixing of electrochromic polymers

   incorporated as the active material in user-controlled electrochromic
   eyewear. Color mixing of ECPs proceeds in a subtractive fashion, and we
   acquire various hues of brown through the mixing of cyan and yellow
   primaries in combination with orange and periwinkle-blue secondary
   colors. Upon oxidation, all of the created blends exhibit a change in
   transmittance from ca. 10 to 70\% in a few seconds. We demonstrate the
   attractiveness of these ECP blends as active materials in electrochromic
   eyewear by assembling user-controlled, high-contrast, fast-switching,
   and fully solution-processable electrochromic lenses with colorless
   transmissive states and colored states that correspond to commercially

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{In this report, we compare time averaging and ensemble averaging as two
   different methods for phase space sampling in molecular dynamics (MD)
   calculations of thermal conductivity. For the comparison, we calculate
   thermal conductivities of solid argon and silicon structures, using
   equilibrium MD. We introduce two different schemes for the ensemble
   averaging approach and show that both can reduce the total simulation
   time as compared to time averaging. It is also found that velocity
   rescaling is an efficient mechanism for phase space exploration.
   Although our methodology is tested using classical MD, the approaches
   used for generating independent trajectories may find their greatest
   utility in computationally expensive simulations such as first
   principles MD. For such simulations, where each time step is costly,
   time averaging can require long simulation times because each time step
   must be evaluated sequentially and therefore phase space averaging is
   achieved through sequential operations. On the other hand, with ensemble
   averaging, phase space sampling can be achieved through parallel
   operations, since each trajectory is independent. For this reason,
   particularly when using massively parallel architectures, ensemble
   averaging can result in much shorter simulation times (similar to
   100-200X), but exhibits similar overall computational effort. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The bulk and 2-dimensional (2D) electrical transport properties of
   heavily Mg-doped p-type GaN films grown on AlN buffer layers by Metal
   Modulated Epitaxy are explored. Distinctions are made between three
   primary p-type conduction mechanisms: traditional valence band
   conduction, impurity band conduction, and 2D conduction within a 2D hole
   gas at a hetero-interface. The bulk and 2D contributions to the overall
   carrier transport are identified and the relative contributions are
   found to vary strongly with growth conditions. Films grown with III/V
   ratio less than 1.5 exhibit high hole concentrations exceeding 2 x
   10(19) cm(-3) with effective acceptor activation energies of 51 meV.
   Films with III/V ratios greater than 1.5 exhibit lower overall hole
   concentrations and significant contributions from 2D transport at the
   hetero-interface. Films grown with III/V ratio of 1.2 and Mg
   concentrations exceeding 2 x 10(20) cm(-3) show no detectable inversion
   domains or Mg precipitation. Highly Mg-doped p-GaN and p-AlGaN with Al
   fractions up to 27\% similarly exhibit hole concentrations exceeding 2 x
   10(19) cm(-3). The p-GaN and p-Al0.11Ga0.89N films show broad
   ultraviolet (UV) photoluminescence peaks, which intercept the valence
   band, supporting the presence of a Mg acceptor band. Finally, a
   multi-quantum-well light-emitting diode (LED) and p-i-n diode are grown,
   both of which demonstrate rectifying behavior with turn-on voltages of
   3-3.5V and series resistances of 6-10 Omega without the need for any
   post-metallization annealing. The LED exhibits violet-blue luminescence
   at 425 nm, while the p-i-n diode shows UV luminescence at 381 nm, and
   both devices still show substantial light emission even when submerged
   in liquid nitrogen at 77 K. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Dispersive surface waves on an acoustic 2D metamaterial, a metasurface
   consisting of membranes on a rigid surface, have certain propagation
   characteristics with potential applications for resonance based sensing
   and subwavelength imaging. The trapped modes of the system that is
   responsible for the dispersive properties of these acoustic waves are
   analyzed through modal analysis for a small linear membrane array to
   obtain the mode shapes, resonant frequencies, quality factors, and
   wavenumbers. Transient analysis is used for larger arrays to obtain the
   dispersive properties of the traveling waves and is compared to the
   modal analysis. Equifrequency contours of the 2D metasurface illustrate
   interesting features of the metasurface at different frequency regimes
   around the membrane resonance. These features include anisotropic wave
   propagation, directional band gap, negative refraction, and complete
   band gap. Effects of membrane pitch, randomness of resonance, and
   aperiodic membrane spacing on dispersion, band gaps, and quality factor
   of the trapped modes on the metasurface are investigated as they relate
   to realistic implementations for different applications. (C) 2015 AIP

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous solids are randomly disordered without any long-range periodic
   atomic arrangement and thus appear isotropic. Here, we show in metallic
   glasses that this view does not hold at small scales: Strong mechanical
   anisotropy emerges when the sample size decreases below about 15 nm as
   shown by the marked deviation in stress-strain relations as well as
   elastic modulus along different loading directions. The size induced
   mechanical anisotropy is naturally related to structural anisotropy that
   is absent before loading. The anisotropic stress and modulus versus the
   size yield different scaling exponents in different stages of
   deformation, hinting at different deformation mechanisms. The size
   effect discovered here points to the existence of intrinsic
   heterogeneity defined by the anisotropy, which may play an important
   role in structure-property relations in amorphous solids. (C) 2015 AIP

   stereoinversion of amino acids at supersaturated conditions}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{416-425}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{A new route for resolution of amino acids that form racemic compounds
   was developed using chemo-enzymatic stereoinversion reactions in
   saturated or supersaturated solutions: i.e. at high solute
   concentrations. The reactions enrich the solution in the desired
   enantiomer and move the solution composition to a thermodynamic region
   where the pure desired enantiomer can be crystallized. The reaction
   sequence first oxidizes the undesired D-enantiomer with D-amino acid
   oxidase, and the resulting intermediate imino acid is reduced into a
   racemic mixture of the enantiomers by ammonia borane. The result of this
   reaction network is completely enantioselective because the first step
   is enantioselective. The concept has been demonstrated by resolving
   racemic mixtures of phenylalanine and methionine, which allowed recovery
   of L-phenylalanine and L-methionine crystals with chemical and
   enantiomeric purities greater than 99\%. Finally, reaction and
   crystallization kinetics were determined and combined to model this
   reactive-crystallization system. These results were used to demonstrate
   the potential of combining chemo-enzymatic reactions and crystallization
   to enhance the productivity of the process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We demonstrate transverse-magnetic (TM) dominant deep-ultraviolet (DUV)
   stimulated emission from photo-pumped AlGaN multiple-quantum-well lasers
   grown pseudomorphically on an AlN/sapphire template by means of
   photoluminescence at room temperature. The TM-dominant stimulated
   emission was observed at wavelengths of 239, 242, and 243 nm with low
   thresholds of 280, 250, and 290 kW/cm(2), respectively. In particular,
   the lasing wavelength of 239 nm is shorter compared to other reports for
   AlGaN lasers grown on foreign substrates including sapphire and SiC. The
   peak wavelength difference between the transverse-electric
   (TE)-polarized emission and TM-polarized emission was approximately zero
   for the lasers in this study, indicating the crossover of crystal-field
   split-off hole and heavy-hole valence bands. The rapid variation of
   polarization between TE- and TM-dominance versus the change in lasing
   wavelength from 243 to 249 nm can be attributed to a dramatic change in
   the TE-to-TM gain coefficient ratio for the sapphire-based DUV lasers in

Abstract = {{The epoxy composites consisting of BaTiO3 fillers with size of 100 nm
   and 200 nm were prepared, respectively. The thermo-mechanical and
   electrical properties of BaTiO3-epoxy composites were investigated using
   complex permittivity, electric modulus and ac electrical conductivity.
   The effects of filler size on the structure, filler-matrix interface and
   properties were discussed. The Havriliak-Negami model was used to
   analyze the dielectric relaxation of composites. The results show that
   larger filler tends to exhibit enhanced dynamic modulus and higher T-g
   because of the increase of effective volume fraction. The tetragonal
   phase formation in the BaTiO3 is important to achieve enhanced
   permittivity of the composite. The relaxation responses of composites
   revealed by electric modulus and complex permittivity show that the
   Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization and tetragonal phase
   transition of BaTiO3 affect the dielectric responses of composites. The
   conduction process is not only related with the barrier hopping but also
   tunneling effect of electrons. Based on the electrical properties of
   BaTiO3-epoxy composite with 100 nm BaTiO3 at GHz, a compact band-pass
   filter with significant area reduction was designed and fabricated. The
   measured results show that the BaTiO3-epoxy composite is promising for
   advanced wireless device applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Recent studies show that cationic amine-based water treatment polymers
   may be important precursors that contribute to formation of the probable
   human carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) during water treatment
   and disinfection. To better understand how water treatment parameters
   affect NDMA formation from the polymers, the effects of in situ
   chloramination, breakpoint chlorination, and pre-oxidation on the NDMA
   formation from the polymers were investigated. NDMA formation potential
   (NDMA-FP) as well as dimethylamine (DMA) residual concentration were
   measured from poly(epichlorohydrin dimethylamine) (polyamine) and
   poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (poly-DADMAC) solutions upon
   reactions with oxidants including free chlorine, chlorine dioxide,
   ozone, and monochloramine under different treatment conditions. The
   results supported that dichloramine (NHCl2) formation was the critical
   factor affecting NDMA formation from the polymers during in situ
   chloramination. The highest NDMA formation from the polymers occurred
   near the breakpoint of chlorination. Polymer chain breakdown and
   transformation of the released DMA and other intermediates were
   important factors affecting NDMA formation from the polymers in
   pre-oxidation followed by post-chloramination. Pre-oxidation generally
   reduced NDMA-FP of the polymers; however, the treatments involving
   pre-ozonation increased polyDADMAC's NDMA-FP and DMA release. The
   strategies for reducing NDMA formation from the polymers may include the
   avoidance of the conditions favorable to NHCl2 formation and the
   avoidance of polymer exposure to strong oxidants such as ozone. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The theoretically suggested band structure of the novel p-type
   semiconductor lithium niobite (LiNbO2), the direct coupling of photons
   to ion motion, and optically induced band structure modifications are
   investigated by temperature dependent photoluminescence. LiNbO2 has
   previously been used as a memristor material but is shown here to be
   useful as a sensor owing to the electrical, optical, and chemical ease
   of lithium removal and insertion. Despite the high concentration of
   vacancies present in lithium niobite due to the intentional removal of
   lithium atoms, strong photoluminescence spectra are observed even at
   room temperature that experimentally confirm the suggested band
   structure implying transitions from a flat conduction band to a
   degenerate valence band. Removal of small amounts of lithium
   significantly modifies the photoluminescence spectra including
   additional larger than stoichiometric-band gap features. Sufficient
   removal of lithium results in the elimination of the photoluminescence
   response supporting the predicted transition from a direct to indirect
   band gap semiconductor. In addition, non-thermal coupling between the
   incident laser and lithium ions is observed and results in modulation of
   the electrical impedance. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Stretchable radio-frequency electronics are gaining popularity as a
   result of the increased functionality they gain through their flexible
   nature, impossible within the confines of rigid and planar substrates.
   One approach to fabricating stretchable antennas is to embed stretchable
   or flowable conductive materials, such as conductive polymers,
   conductive polymer composites, and liquid metal alloys as stretchable
   conduction lines. However, these conductive materials face many
   challenges, such as low electrical conductivity under mechanical
   deformation and delamination from substrates. In the present study, a
   silicone-based electrically conductive adhesive (silo-ECA) is developed
   that have a conductivity of 1.51 x 10(4) S cm(-1) and can maintain
   conductivity above 1.11 x 10(3) S cm(-1), even at a large stain of
   240\%. By using the stretchable silo-ECAs as a conductor pattern and
   pure silicone elastomers as a base substrate, stretchable antennas can
   be fabricated by stencil printing or soft-lithography. The resulting
   antenna's resonant frequency is tunable over a wide range by mechanical
   modulation. This fabrication method is low-cost, can support large-scale
   production, has high reliability over a wide temperature range, and
   eliminates the concerns of leaking or delamination between conductor and
   substrate experienced in previously reported micro-fluidic antennas.}},

Abstract = {{The white marble domes of the Taj Mahal are iconic images of India that
   attract millions of visitors every year. Over the past several decades
   the outer marble surfaces of the Taj Mahal have begun to discolor with
   time and must be painstakingly cleaned every several years. Although it
   has been generally believed that the discoloration is in some way linked
   with poor air quality in the Agra region, the specific components of air
   pollution responsible have yet to be identified. With this in mind,
   ambient particulate matter (PM) samples were collected over a one-year
   period and found to contain relatively high concentrations of light
   absorbing particles that could potentially discolor the Taj Mahal marble
   surfaces, that include black carbon (BC), light absorbing organic carbon
   (brown carbon, BrC), and dust. Analyses of particles deposited to marble
   surrogate surfaces at the Taj Mahal indicate that a large fraction of
   the outer Taj Mahal surfaces are covered with particles that contain
   both carbonaceous components and dust. We have developed a novel
   approach that estimates the impact of these deposited particles on the
   visible light surface reflectance, which is in turn used to estimate the
   perceived color by the human eye. Results indicate that deposited light
   absorbing dust and carbonaceous particles (both BC and BrC from the
   combustion of fossil fuels and biomass) are responsible for the surface
   discoloration of the Taj Mahal. Overall, the results suggest that the
   deposition of light absorbing particulate matter in regions of high
   aerosol loading are not only influencing cultural heritage but also the
   aesthetics of both natural and urban surfaces.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the photogeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by
   C-60 under UV irradiation, when humic acid (HA) or fulvic acid (FA) is
   present. When C-60 and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were present as a
   mixture, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation concentrations were 1.2-1.5
   times higher than the sum of O-1(2) concentrations that were produced
   when C60 and DOM were present in water by themselves. When C-60 and HA
   were present as a mixture, superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) were
   2.2-2.6 times more than when C-60 and HA were present in water by
   themselves. A synergistic ROS photogeneration mechanism involved in
   energy and electron transfer between DOM and C-60 was proposed. Enhanced
   O-1(2) generation in the mixtures was partly due to (DOM)-D-3{*} energy
   transfer to O-2. However, it was mostly due to (DOM)-D-3{*} energy
   transfer to C-60 producing C-3(60){*}. C-3(60){*} has a prolonged
   lifetime (>4 mu s) in the mixture and provides sufficient time for
   energy transfer to O-2, which produces O-1(2). The enhanced O-2
   generation for HA/C-60 mixture was because C-3(60){*} mediated electron
   transfer from photoionized HA to O-2. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering DOM when investigating ROS production by C-60.}},

Abstract = {{For more than two decades, radar altimetry missions have provided
   continuous elevation estimates of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). Here,
   we propose a method for using such data to estimate ice-sheet-wide
   surface elevation changes (SECs). The final data set will be based on
   observations acquired from the European Space Agency's Environmental
   Satellite (ENVISAT), European Remote Sensing (ERS)-1 and -2, CryoSat-2,
   and, in the longer term, Sentinel-3 satellites. In order to find the
   best-performing method, an intercomparison exercise has been carried out
   in which the scientific community was asked to provide their best SEC
   estimates as well as feedback sheets describing the applied method. Due
   to the hitherto few radar-based SEC analyses as well as the higher
   accuracy of laser data, the participants were asked to use either
   ENVISAT radar or ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) laser
   altimetry over the Jakobshavn Isbrae drainage basin. The submissions
   were validated against airborne laser-scanner data, and intercomparisons
   were carried out to analyse the potential of the applied methods and to
   find whether the two altimeters were capable of resolving the same
   signal. The analyses found great potential of the applied repeat-track
   and cross-over techniques, and, for the first time over Greenland, that
   repeat-track analyses from radar altimetry agreed well with laser data.
   Since topography-related errors can be neglected in cross-over analyses,
   it is expected that the most accurate, ice-sheet-wide SEC estimates are
   obtained by combining the cross-over and repeat-track techniques. It is
   thus possible to exploit the high accuracy of the former and the large
   spatial data coverage of the latter. Based on CryoSat's different
   operation modes, and the increased spatial and temporal data coverage,
   this shows good potential for a future inclusion of CryoSat-2 and
   Sentinel-3 data to continuously obtain accurate SEC estimates both in
   the interior and margin ice sheet.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the investigation of wave propagation in a periodically
   perforated plate. A unit cell with double-C perforations is selected as
   a test article suitable to investigate two-dimensional dispersion
   characteristics, group velocities, and internal resonances. A numerical
   model, formulated using Mindlin plate elements, is developed to predict
   relevant wave characteristics such as dispersion, and group velocity
   variation as a function of frequency and direction of propagation.
   Experimental tests are conducted through a scanning laser vibrometer,
   which provides full wave field information. The analysis of time domain
   wave field images allows the assessment of plate dispersion, and the
   comparison with numerical predictions. The obtained results show the
   predictive ability of the considered numerical approach and illustrate
   how the considered plate configuration could be used as the basis for
   the design of phononic waveguides with directional and internal resonant
   characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{At the contention-based synchronization, e.g., initial ranging process,
   it is crucial to identify multiple users through ranging codes and
   estimate the corresponding parameters such as timing offset and
   frequency offset. This paper presents an improved parameter estimation
   and pairing algorithm for initial ranging process in orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink systems by exploiting
   multidimensional harmonic retrieval (HR) technique. Unlike most existing
   techniques that estimate each parameters independently and associate the
   ranging codes with the estimated parameters manually, the proposed
   method estimates multiple user's ranging code, timing and frequency
   offsets simultaneously, and pair up all the multiple parameters
   automatically. The simulation results confirm that the proposed
   technique not only improves the ranging code detection capability and
   adjusts the acquisition range of the estimators but also increases the
   maximum number of resolvable users for given samples.}},

Abstract = {{Although the relative velocity of a single crystal or bubble in a
   quiescent fluid (melt) is well characterized, the interplay of
   crystals/bubbles in multiparticle systems and its effect on their
   settling/rising velocity is poorly quantified. We propose a theoretical
   model for the hindered velocity of non-Brownian emulsions and
   suspensions of nondeformable fluid and solid particles in the creeping
   flow regime. The model is based on three sets of correction: two on the
   drag coefficient experienced by each particle to account for both return
   flow and Smoluchowski effects and a correction on the rheology to
   account for nonlocal interactions introduced as a mean-field effective
   viscosity. Our model is tested against new and published experimental
   data over a wide range of particle volume fraction and viscosity ratio
   between the fluids. We find an excellent agreement between our model and
   experiments. The model is then applied to show that hindered settling
   can increase mineral residence time by up to an order of magnitude in
   convecting magma chambers.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death in
   developed nations, and there remains a need for cardiac therapeutic
   systems that mitigate tissue damage. Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and
   other stem cell types are attractive candidates for treatment of
   myocardial infarction; however, the benefit of these cells may be as a
   result of paracrine effects.
   Objective: We tested the hypothesis that CPCs secrete proregenerative
   exosomes in response to hypoxic conditions.
   Methods and Results: The angiogenic and antifibrotic potential of
   secreted exosomes on cardiac endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts
   were assessed. We found that CPC exosomes secreted in response to
   hypoxia enhanced tube formation of endothelial cells and decreased
   profibrotic gene expression in TGF-beta-stimulated fibroblasts,
   indicating that these exosomes possess therapeutic potential. Microarray
   analysis of exosomes secreted by hypoxic CPCs identified 11 miRNAs that
   were upregulated compared with exosomes secreted by CPCs grown under
   normoxic conditions. Principle component analysis was performed to
   identify miRNAs that were coregulated in response to distinct
   exosome-generating conditions. To investigate the cue-signal-response
   relationships of these miRNA clusters with a physiological outcome of
   tube formation or fibrotic gene expression, partial least squares
   regression analysis was applied. The importance of each up-or
   downregulated miRNA on physiological outcomes was determined. Finally,
   to validate the model, we delivered exosomes after ischemia-reperfusion
   injury. Exosomes from hypoxic CPCs improved cardiac function and reduced
   fibrosis.
   Conclusions: These data provide a foundation for subsequent research of
   the use of exosomal miRNA and systems biology as therapeutic strategies
   for the damaged heart.}},

Abstract = {{A process for making polypropylene (PP) single-polymer composites (SPCs)
   by insert injection molding was investigated. PP SPCs with relatively
   good tensile and interfacial properties were prepared with a relatively
   short cycle time. Melt-spun PP fibers from the same resin as the matrix
   were treated in heated silicone oil, with and without tension, to study
   the changes of fiber properties upon exposure to high temperature. PP
   SPCs containing 36 wt\% lab-made fabric achieved a tensile strength of
   70 MPa, 2.3 times that of neat PP. Polarized light microscopy of PP SPCs
   with uniaxial fibers indicated that different crystalline regions formed
   from partial melting of fibers along the fiber surface. Differential
   scanning calorimetry results showed that most fibers could maintain the
   thermal properties after molding. Voids were not observed in the
   scanning electron microscopy images of the fracture surface after
   tensile failure indicating good bonding between the matrix and fibers.

Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{87-95}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{We outline and review an approach to the construction of conductometric
   sensors that demonstrate considerably higher sensitivities than
   traditional metal oxide sensors. Simple sensor platforms do not require
   film-based technology, operate at room temperature, and can be obtained
   without the use of time consuming self-assembly processes. A combined
   nanopore coated micro-porous array is deposited with nanostructure
   directing acidic metal oxide island sites which vary in their Lewis
   acidity, decorate the micropores, and control an electron transduction
   process. The interaction of analytes with these island sites varies in a
   predictable manner and can be modified through in-situ functionalization
   of their Lewis acidity. The micropores allow rapid Fickian diffusion of
   analytes to the active nanostructured island sites whose reversible
   interaction with the analyte dominates the sensor response. We require
   only that the island sites be deposited at sufficiently low
   concentration so as not to interact electronically with each other.
   Highly accurate repeat placement of the depositions is not required. The
   nanoporous walls of the microarray act as a phase match for the
   deposition of a diversity of nanostructures that are selected for
   deposition from a variety of easily obtained solution-based sources as
   the forgiving deposition process requires a minimum of energy
   consumption and time. Comparisons to a variety of metal oxide systems
   are considered. Observed sensitivities and the sensor system
   reversibility can be predicted from the recently developing IHSAB model.

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the proposed
   rate-limiting step of the hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of
   terminal epoxides as catalyzed by Co-salen-X (X = counterion) in order
   to resolve questions surrounding the mechanism. The present results
   indicate that the bimetallic mechanism proposed by Jacobsen shows
   nonadditive, cooperative catalysis with a larger reduction in barrier
   height than the sum of the barrier height reductions from the two
   monometallic reaction pathways. We computed barrier heights for the
   reaction using several counterions (chloride, acetate, tosylate, and
   hydroxide). For the three counterions that are experimentally active
   (chloride, acetate, and tosylate) the barrier heights are 35, 38, and 34
   kJ mol(-1), respectively, while for hydroxide it is 48 kJ mol(-1). The
   similarity of the barrier heights for chloride, acetate, and tosylate is
   in agreement with their similar peak reaction rates. The finding that
   Co-salen-X with these counterions leads to rather different overall
   reaction profiles suggests that they have quite different rates of
   reaction with epoxide to form the activated Co-salen-OH required for the
   bimetallic mechanism. Co-salen-OH is inactive as the sole catalyst for
   HKR, and this inactivity is ascribed to its larger barrier height for
   the ring-opening step, rather than to any inability to activate epoxide.
   Barrier heights were also computed using propylene oxide, 1-hexene
   oxide, and epichlorohydrin; propylene oxide and 1-hexene oxide have
   similar barrier heights, 35.5 and 33.2 kJ mol1, respectively, and
   epichlorohydrin has a significantly lower barrier height of 18.8 kJ
   mol(-1), which is qualitatively consistent with experiments showing
   faster reactions for epicholorohydrin than propylene oxide when
   catalyzed by Co-salen-OAc.}},

Title = {{Seismic fragility analysis of skewed bridges in the central southeastern
   United States}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{Skewed bridges are often encountered in the highway bridge system when
   the geometry cannot accommodate straight (unskewed) bridges. The
   objective of this study is to investigate the influence of skew angle on
   the seismic response of bridges using nonlinear time-history analysis
   and probabilistic seismic assessments. Six types of skewed and straight
   bridges (including multi-span simply supported, multi-span continuous,
   and single-span skewed bridges with steel or concrete girders together
   with non-integral abutments) commonly used in the central and
   southeastern United States (CSEUS) are considered for establishing
   three-dimensional numerical bridge models. The six bridge types are
   further categorized as: (1) non-seismically designed (NSD) bridges, (2)
   bridges with seismically designed (SD) columns, (3) bridges retrofitted
   by (i) column jackets, (ii) isolator bearings (lBs) and keeper plates
   (KPs), (iii) restrainer cables (RCs) and shear keys (SKs), or (iv) seat
   extenders (SEs) and shear keys (SKs). Probabilistic seismic demand
   models incorporating geometric and material uncertainty parameters for
   the bridges under a suite of ground motions are established to develop
   corresponding sets of fragility curves in terms of vulnerable bridge
   components. System fragility curves are further developed through a
   combination of the component fragility curves in the bridges.
   Comparisons of the fragility curves between the straight and skewed
   bridges indicate that the larger the skew angle, the more vulnerable the
   bridges, regardless of NSD bridges, bridges with SD columns, and
   retrofitted bridges. Formulas that consider effect of skew on the values
   of fragility parameters in the fragility curves are derived for each
   bridge class, component type, and limit state. Finally, the retrofit of
   columns and seismically designed columns can reduce column damage
   probabilities without significantly increasing demands to the other
   bridge component types, leading to a lower bridge system risk than that
   for the NSD bridges. However, although the other three retrofits
   (IB\&KP, RC\&SK, and SE\&SK) can reduce transverse and/or longitudinal
   demands on the bearings, the column demands remain a similar or worse
   damage level than that for the NSD bridges, resulting in a similar or
   higher risk for the three retrofitted bridge systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Exercise capacity in single-ventricle patients after Fontan correlates
   with haemodynamic energy loss in TCPC}},
Journal = {{HEART}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{139-143}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Objective Elevated energy loss in the total cavopulmonary connection
   (TCPC) is hypothesised to have a detrimental effect on clinical outcomes
   in single-ventricle physiology, which may be magnified with exercise.
   This study investigates the relationship between TCPC haemodynamic
   energy dissipation and exercise performance in single-ventricle
   patients.
   Methods Thirty consecutive Fontan patients with TCPC and standard
   metabolic exercise testing were included. Specific anatomies and flow
   rates at rest and exercise were obtained from cardiac MR (CMR) and
   phase-encoded velocity mapping. Exercise CMR images were acquired
   immediately following supine lower limb exercise using a CMR-compatible
   cycle ergometer. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed
   to determine power loss of the TCPC anatomies using in vivo anatomies
   and measured flows.
   Results A significant negative linear correlation was observed between
   indexed power loss at exercise and (a) minute oxygen consumption
   (r=-0.60, p< 0.0005) and (b) work (r=-0.62, p< 0.0005) at anaerobic
   threshold. As cardiac output increased during exercise, indexed power
   loss increased in an exponential fashion (y= 0.9671x(3.0263), p<
   0.0001).
   Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate the relationship
   between power loss and exercise performance with the TCPC being one of
   the few modifiable factors to allow for improved quality of life. These
   results suggest that aerobic exercise tolerance in Fontan patients may,
   in part, be a consequence of TCPC power loss.}},

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{202}},
Pages = {{183-188}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The high-polymeric degree or molecular-weight of self-made
   polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) was successfully used to synthesize aerogels
   with several advantageous mechanical characteristics, compared with
   those based on conventional tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) aerogel
   preparation methods. The first advantage is their lower initial values
   of bulk modulus (k(0)), compared with those prepared via the two-step
   method; this is due to release of internal stress during the shrinkage
   of wet gel. Secondly, a collapse index n of -0.125 is obtained by the
   collapse law; this implies a new buckling destruction model. This is
   different from those prepared via the two-step method, and suggests that
   a hierarchical filament structure, formed by the connection of
   nano-particles, constitutes the solid skeleton of pores. In this paper,
   average aerogel pore sizes between 16.0 and 39.3 nm are analyzed by the
   combination of Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) and Nitrogen
   Adsorption Desorption (NAD). The microstructure and morphology of the
   aerogels are demonstrated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and
   Field Emission Scan Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{A comparative analysis of mouse and human medial geniculate nucleus
   connectivity: A DTI and anterograde tracing study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{53-66}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the function and connectivity of thalamic nuclei is
   critical for understanding normal and pathological brain function. The
   medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) has been studied mostly in the context
   of auditory processing and its connection to the auditory cortex.
   However, there is a growing body of evidence that the MGN and
   surrounding associated areas ('MGN/S') have a diversity of projections
   including those to the globus pallidus, caudate/putamen, amygdala,
   hypothalamus, and thalamus. Concomitantly, pathways projecting to the
   medial geniculate include not only the inferior colliculus but also the
   auditory cortex, insula, cerebellum, and globus pallidus. Here we expand
   our understanding of the connectivity of the MGN/S by using comparative
   diffusion weighted imaging with probabilistic tractography in both human
   and mouse brains (most previous work was in rats). In doing so, we
   provide the first report that attempts to match probabilistic
   tractography results between human and mice. Additionally, we provide
   anterograde tracing results for the mouse brain, which corroborate the
   probabilistic tractography findings. Overall, the study provides
   evidence for the homology of MGN/S patterns of connectivity across
   species for understanding translational approaches to thalamic
   connectivity and function. Further, it points to the utility of DTI in
   both human studies and small animal modeling, and it suggests potential
   roles of these connections in human cognition, behavior, and disease.

   emission control by Fe(VI) absorbent}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Abstract = {{With the timelines for implementation of the U. S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's mercury emission control rules approaching soon,
   finding an innovative and cost-effective mercury removal technology has
   become increasingly important. The most challenging species in all the
   mercury forms is gaseous elemental mercury (Hg-0). The objective of this
   work is to inspect the absorption behavior and removal of Hg-0 by
   Fe(VI). The synergistic effects of various factors were investigated and
   the optimization for Hg-0 removal by Fe(VI) was achieved based on the
   response surface methodology. The speciation of Fe(VI) and Hg reaction
   species was emphatically analyzed in the entire pH range in order to
   clarify the possible Fe(VI)-based Hg-0 removal mechanism in depth.
   According to the thermodynamics calculation, the Gibbs free energies for
   the reaction between Fe(VI) and Hg-0 in the weak alkaline/acid medium
   are determined as -120.03 kJ/ mol and -235.42 kJ/mol, respectively,
   implying the oxidation of Hg-0 by Fe(VI) is spontaneous and thorough.
   Finally, industrial feasibility analysis indicates that Fe(VI) has the
   practical potential to be a promising removal agent for Hg-0 emission
   control from coal-fired flue gas, which might be integrated into the
   existing mainstream flue gas desulfurization scrubber to achieve the
   removal of multi-pollutants simultaneously, in prospect. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A great challenge for nanotechnology is to controllably organize
   anisotropic nanomaterials into well-defined three-dimensional
   superstructures with customized properties. Here we successfully
   constructed anisotropic Au nanorod (AuNR) helical superstructures
   (helices) with tailored chirality in a programmable manner. By designing
   the X pattern of the arrangement of DNA capturing strands (15nt) on both
   sides of a two-dimensional DNA origami template, AuNRs functionalized
   with the complementary DNA sequences were positioned on the origami and
   were assembled into AuNR helices with the origami intercalated between
   neighboring AuNRs. Left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) AuNR helices
   were conveniently accomplished by solely tuning the mirrored-symmetric X
   patterns of capturing strands on the origami. The inter-rod distance was
   precisely defined as 14 nm and inter-rod angle as 45 degrees, thus a
   full helix contains 9 AuNRs with its length up to about 220 nm. By
   changing the AuNR/origami molar ratio in the assembly system, the
   average number of AuNR in the helices was tuned from 2 to 4 and 9.
   Intense chiroptical activities arose from the longest AuNR helices with
   a maximum anisotropy factor of similar to 0.02, which is highly
   comparable to the reported macroscopic AuNR assemblies. We expect that
   our strategy of origami templated assembly of anisotropic chiral
   superstructures would inspire the bottom-up fabrication of optically
   active nanostructures and shed light on a variety of applications, such
   as chiral fluids, chiral signal amplification, and fluorescence combined
   chiral spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Amine-functionalized porous silicas (aminosilicas) are incorporated into
   latex coatings, and the airborne aldehyde abatement abilities of the
   dried applied films are examined. The aminosilicas in the resulting
   dried films are uniformly dispersed inside the latex component, and they
   are demonstrated to be effective adsorbents for airborne aldehydes. The
   latex component does not hinder the adsorption capacities of the
   aminosilicas, with the adsorbed amounts being similar to those of the
   original aminosilica powders before incorporation into the latex.
   However, the adsorption rates are slowed after incorporation of the
   aminosilicas into the films, relative to that of the powder samples.
   Overall, the aminosilica-incorporated latex films are demonstrated to be
   effective aldehyde-abating materials.}},

Title = {{Effects of organic matter on stiffness of overconsolidated state and
   anisotropy of engineered organoclays at small strain}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{19-28}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Organic rich soils are frequently encountered beneath infrastructure
   components that are sensitive to dynamic loading, such as bridges in
   earthquake prone regions. Because the engineering properties of these
   soils can be significantly impacted by the presence of organic matter,
   it is important to characterize their small strain dynamic properties.
   However, natural organic matter, is heterogeneous and highly variable;
   consequently, this experimental investigation quantified the dynamic
   behaviors of six organoclays that were synthesized under controlled
   laboratory conditions using quaternary ammonium cations as organic
   carbon in the clay interlayer. The small strain properties of these
   clays were measured with bender element tests to quantify the effects of
   organic carbon content on the dynamic properties of the soils,
   particularly on the overconsolidation and stiffness anisotropy.
   Experimental results demonstrated that the preloading effect of
   organoclays decreased with increasing total organic content due to the
   decrease in permanent fabric change and the release of lateral stress
   locking. Because of relatively limited rebound of organoclays (C-s/C-c:
   0.025-0.07) as compared to inorganic soils (C-s/C-c: 0.1-0.2), the
   exponent for preloading ratio in the G(max) estimating formula is larger
   than 034, suggesting that tested organoclays showed a significant
   preloading effect when compared to inorganic soils. Additionally,
   organoclays tested in this study showed inherent anisotropy
   (G(max)(HH)/G(max)(VH) when K-0 = 1: 0.93-1.42) and cross anisotropy in
   HV and VH directions (G(max)(HV)/G(max)(VH): 0.74-1.21), demonstrating
   behaviors that were comparable to that of inorganic soils. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We report a novel synthesis to ultra high purity
   7,14-bis((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)dibenzo{[}b,def]-chrysene (TMS-DBC) and
   the use of this material in the growth of single crystals by solution
   and vapor deposition techniques. We observe that the substrate
   temperature has a dramatic impact on the crystal growth, producing two
   distinct polymorphs of TMS-DBC; low temperature (LT) fine red needles
   and high temperature (HT) large yellow platelets. Single crystal X-ray
   crystallography confirms packing structures where the LT crystals form a
   1D slipped-stack structure, while the HT crystals adopt a 2D brickwork
   motif. These polymorphs also represent a rare example where both are
   extremely stable and do not interconvert to the other crystal structure
   upon solvent or thermal annealing. Single crystal organic field-effect
   transistors of the LT and HT crystals show that the HT 2D brickwork
   motif produces hole mobilities as high as 2.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), while the
   mobility of the 1D structure is significantly lower, at 0.028 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1). Electronic-structure calculations indicate that the superior
   charge transport in the brickwork polymorph in comparison to the
   slipped-stack polymorph is due to the presence of an increased
   dimensionality of the charge migration pathways.}},

   microfluidic channels on PMMA are bonded by an SU-8 layer that is also
   inkjet-printed on the conductive patterns. The proposed MM absorber
   provides frequency-tuning capability for different fluids in the
   microfluidic channels. We performed full-wave simulations and
   measurements that confirmed that the resonant frequency decreased from
   4.42 GHz to 3.97 GHz after the injection of distilled water into the

Abstract = {{The Square Tiling Problem was recently introduced as equivalent to the
   problem of reconstructing an image from patches and a possible
   general-purpose indexing tool. Unfortunately, the Square Tiling Problem
   was shown to be NP-hard. A 1/2-approximation is known.
   We show that if the tile alphabet is fixed and finite, there is a
   Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for the Square Tiling
   Problem with approximation ratio of (1 - epsilon/2 log n) for any given
   epsilon <= 1.
   Another topic handled in this paper is the NP-hardness of the Tiling
   problem with an infinite alphabet. We show that when the alphabet is not
   bounded, even the decision version for rectangles of size 3n is
   NP-Complete. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An assessment of intra-patient variability on observed relationships
   between wall shear stress and plaque progression in coronary arteries}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wall shear stress (WSS) has been associated with sites of
   plaque localization and with changes in plaque composition in human
   coronary arteries. Different values have been suggested for categorizing
   WSS as low, physiologic or high; however, uncertainties in flow rates,
   both across subjects and within a given individual, can affect the
   classification of WSS and thus influence the observed relationships
   between local hemodynamics and plaque changes over time. This study
   examines the effects of uncertainties in flow rate boundary conditions
   upon WSS values and investigates the influence of this variability on
   the observed associations of WSS with changes in VH-IVUS derived plaque
   components.
   Methods: Three patients with coronary artery disease underwent baseline
   and 12 month follow-up angiography and virtual histology-intravascular
   ultrasound (VH-IVUS) measurements. Coronary artery models were
   reconstructed from the data and models with and without side-branches
   were created. Patient-specific Doppler ultrasound (DUS) data were
   employed as inflow boundary conditions and computational fluid dynamics
   was used to calculate the WSS in each model. Further, the influence of
   representative coronary artery flow waveforms upon WSS values was
   investigated and the concept of treating WSS using relative, rather than
   actual, values was explored.
   Results: Models that included side-branch outflows and subject-specific
   DUS velocities were considered to be the reference cases. Hemodynamic
   differences were caused by the exclusion of side-branches and by
   imposing alternative velocity waveforms. One patient with fewer
   side-branches and a scaled generic waveform had little deviation from
   the reference case, while another patient with several side-branches
   excluded showed much larger departures from the reference situation.
   Differences between models and the respective reference cases were
   reduced when data were analyzed using relative, rather than actual, WSS.
   Conclusions: When considering individual subjects, large variations in
   patient-specific flow rates and exclusion of multiple side-branches in
   computational models can cause significant differences in observed
   associations between plaque evolution and ranges of computed WSS. These
   differences may contribute to the large variability typically found
   among subjects in pooled populations. Relative WSS may be more useful
   than actual WSS as a correlative variable when there is a large degree
   of uncertainty in flow rate data.}},

Abstract = {{Salt removal is a prerequisite for electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of biological samples. Rapid desalting
   and a low volume connection to an electrospray tip are required for
   time-resolved measurements. We have developed a microfabricated
   desalting device that meets both requirements, thus providing the
   foundational technology piece for transient ESI-MS measurements of
   complex biological liquid specimens. In the microfabricated device, the
   sample flows in a channel separated from a higher flow rate, salt-free
   counter solution by a monolithically integrated nanoporous alumina
   membrane, which can support pressure differences between the flow
   channels of over 600 kPa. Salt is removed by exploiting the large
   difference in diffusivities between salts and the typical ESI-MS target
   bioanalytes, e.g., peptides and proteins. We demonstrate the capability
   to remove 95\% of salt from a sample solution in similar to 1 s while
   retaining sufficiently high concentration of a relatively low molecular
   weight protein, cytochrome-c, for ESI-MS detection.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constitutes a substantial fraction of
   fine particulate matter and has important impacts on climate and human
   health. The extent to which human activities alter SOA formation from
   biogenic emissions in the atmosphere is largely undetermined. Here, we
   present direct observational evidence on the magnitude of anthropogenic
   influence on biogenic SOA formation based on comprehensive ambient
   measurements in the southeastern United States (US). Multiple
   high-time-resolution mass spectrometry organic aerosol measurements were
   made during different seasons at various locations, including urban and
   rural sites in the greater Atlanta area and Centreville in rural
   Alabama. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the roles
   of anthropogenic SO2 and NOx in ambient SOA formation. We show that
   isoprene-derived SOA is directly mediated by the abundance of sulfate,
   instead of the particle water content and/or particle acidity as
   suggested by prior laboratory studies. Anthropogenic NOx is shown to
   enhance nighttime SOA formation via nitrate radical oxidation of
   monoterpenes, resulting in the formation of condensable organic
   nitrates. Together, anthropogenic sulfate and NOx can mediate 43-70\% of
   total measured organic aerosol (29-49\% of sub-micron particulate
   matter, PM1) in the southeastern US during summer. These measurements
   imply that future reduction in SO2 and NOx emissions can considerably
   reduce the SOA burden in the southeastern US. Updating current modeling
   frameworks with these observational constraints will also lead to more
   accurate treatment of aerosol formation for regions with substantial
   anthropogenic-biogenic interactions and consequently improve air quality
   and climate simulations.}},

   integrated with an elastoacoustic mirror configuration. Fourier
   transform-based spatial optimization of a piezoelectric energy harvester
   domain weakly coupled to a thin plate housing a continuous elliptical
   elastoacoustic mirror is presented. Computational modeling and
   experimental testing are employed to quantify performance enhancement in
   power generation using the presented approach. Excellent agreement is
   observed between numerical simulations and experimental measurements.
   Specifically, dramatic enhancement of the harvested power output is
   reported by patterning the electrodes of a rectangular polyvinylidene

   and self-powered active sensing}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been proved as a simple,
   reliable, cost-effective, and efficient means to harvest ambient
   mechanical energy in a normal environment, although its performance
   evaluation under the room temperature is still lacking. Here, we
   systematically looked into the reliance of triboelectric nanogenerators
   output on the ambient temperature spanning from 77 K to 320 K. Employed
   the most commonly used Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and aluminum as
   two contact materials, both the output voltage and current show a
   tendency of increase with decreasing temperature. Applicability of
   triboelectric nanogenerator over a wide range of temperature was
   confirmed from 77 K to 320 K. And, an output enhancement of 79.3\% was
   experimentally obtained at the temperature of 77 K compared to that at a
   temperature of 300 K. However, a reverse tendency was observed for the
   TiO2 nanotubes/PTFE and Al coated TiO2 nanotubes/PTFE based
   triboelectric nanogenerators. This work can contribute not only to the
   design and packaging of triboelectric devices to operate at extreme
   environmental temperatures but also to the fundamental understanding of
   the mechanism of triboelectric effect. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{NixCo1-xFe2O4 (x = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) particles were prepared by a
   self-designed method, i.e., microwave assisted ball milling. A series of
   characterizations were carried out on the prepared powders, including
   X-ray Diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and vector network analyzer (VNA).
   XRD and TEM results indicated that the particles are well-crystallized
   and the average size is about 15 nm. According to VSM results, the M-s
   values are 76 emu/gm, 61 emu/gm and 46 emu/gm respectively, which
   obviously presented higher saturation magnetization values compared with
   other existing methods. Complex permittivity and permeability of Ni-Co
   ferrites were explored by VNA in the frequency of 2-18 GHz, and the
   reflection loss (RL) was also calculated. The results illustrated that
   the minimum reflection loss values of the three ferrites all emerged in
   the range of 9-12 GHz, and the Ni0.8Co0.2Fe2O4 with a thickness of 2.5
   mm could achieve -36.2 dB at 11.52 GHz, which indicated that the Ni-Co
   ferrite nanoparticles possessed great potential in microwave absorption
   applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article is motivated by a computer experiment conducted for
   optimizing residual stresses in the machining of metals. Although
   kriging is widely used in the analysis of computer experiments, it
   cannot be easily applied to model the residual stresses because they are
   obtained as a profile. The high dimensionality caused by this functional
   response introduces severe computational challenges in kriging. It is
   well known that if the functional data are observed on a regular grid,
   the computations can be simplified using an application of Kronecker
   products. However, the case of irregular grid is quite complex. In this
   article, we develop a Gibbs sampling-based expectation maximization
   algorithm, which converts the irregularly spaced data into a regular
   grid so that the Kronecker product-based approach can be employed for
   efficiently fitting a kriging model to the functional data.

Abstract = {{A new space-filling design, called minimum energy design (MED), is
   proposed to explore unknown regions of the design space of particular
   interest to an experimenter. The key ideas involved in constructing the
   MED are the visualization of each design point as a charged particle
   inside a box, and minimization of the total potential energy of these
   particles. It is shown through theoretical arguments and simulations
   that with a proper choice of the charge function, the MED can
   asymptotically generate any arbitrary probability density function. A
   version of the MED, which adaptively updates the design by
   ``learning{''} about the unknown response surface sequentially, is
   proposed and implemented. Two potential applications of MED in
   simulation of complex probability densities and optimization of complex
   response surfaces are discussed and demonstrated with examples. This

Abstract = {{This paper focusses on the strange nature and qualitative behavior
   associated with the systems characterized by State Dependent-Delay
   Differential Equations (SD-DDEs). We consider one of the most simple and
   innocently looking SD-DDEs. (x) over dot (t) = +/- x(t - x(t)). This
   retarded SD-DDE brings a lot of intricacies. It looks linear but is
   actually a nonlinear SD-DDE in disguise. It exhibits the phenomenon of
   bifurcation. Also there is a switch in the stability properties of this
   system. The type of bifurcation exhibited by the system. (x) over dot
   (t) = - x(t -x(t)) + mu is transcritical. Furthermore, its Taylor series
   approximation, based on truncation and partial sums, gives no idea of
   the response. We show that Taylorization of SD-DDEs, which is
   ubiquitously used in physics and engineering community, could be
   misleading. We also perform singular and regular perturbation analyses
   and derive the solution of the small signal perturbed system in terms of
   the Lambert-W function. We also demonstrate that the instability of
   SD-DDE is quite different from that of ODEs. Our simulation results
   reveal that serious errors may occur when SD-DDEs are approximated
   either by Taylorization or by constant delay systems.}},

   developed. The robustness of the controller is enhanced to handle both

Abstract = {{When cranes lift heavy payloads off the ground, the payload may slide or
   swing sideways unexpectedly. This dangerous motion occurs when the
   payload is not directly beneath the overhead suspension point of the
   hoist cable. Given that cable suspension points are usually tens of
   feet, and perhaps hundreds of feet above the payload, it is very
   difficult for crane operators to know if the hoist cable is perfectly
   vertical before they start to lift the payload off the ground.
   Inevitably, some horizontal motion of the payload will occur at lift
   off. If an off-center lift creates substantial horizontal motion, then
   it can create significant hazards for the human operators, the payload,
   and the surrounding environment. This paper develops dynamic models of
   off-centered lifts, laying the foundation for determining the unwanted
   motions that should to be accounted for in a future controller design.}},

Abstract = {{As an objective reality, the social behavior pattern of Primary Users
   (PUs) has significant impacts on the design and management of the
   secondary network. However, most of the existing works overlook this
   fact by simplifying the spectrum whitespace assumption. In this paper,
   we study the joint routing and time-domain scheduling problem for
   Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) by considering the social behaviors of
   PUs. Our main contributions consist of four aspects. First, we analyze
   the social pattern of PUs based on two practical data traces. According
   to the obtained social pattern, the available spectrum whitespace is
   derived for SUs. Subsequently, in terms of previous analysis, we propose
   a centralized joint routing and time-domain scheduling framework with
   global provable epsilon-optimality (epsilon is an element of{[}0, 1]) by
   employing the branch-and-bound technique, where epsilon indicates the
   expected closeness of our solution to the optimum solution. The solution
   of this centralized algorithm can serve as a theoretical benchmark for
   developing future routing and scheduling algorithms for CRNs. Third, we
   design a distributed primary behavior-aware routing and scheduling
   algorithm with local performance guarantee, where the routing and
   scheduling fairness, the available bandwidth, the potential
   interference, etc. are taken into account. Finally, simulation results
   confirm our assertion that primary behaviors have significant impacts on
   the spectrum whitespace, and demonstrate that primary-behavior-aware
   joint routing and scheduling design can utilize spectrum whitespace
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{The existing works on analyzing/utilizing spectrum whitespace in
   Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are either empirical studies lacking of
   theoretical guarantee, or local primary network information based
   inducing inaccurate analysis and estimation, or overlooking the spectrum
   whitespace details. Therefore, we propose to systematically analyze the
   spectrum whitespace in CRNs from a social network perspective. Our main
   contributions include four parts. First, we propose a novel metric named
   centrality score to measure the active weights of Primary Users (PUs) by
   considering each PU's topological importance in the primary network and
   the global primary network running and traffic information.
   Subsequently, based on the centrality scores of PUs, we derive the
   whitespace in CRNs under different social patterns of primary
   activities. Since we consider both the primary network topological
   structure and the global network running and traffic information, our
   whitespace analysis is more accurate compared with the existing works.
   Third, according to our whitespace analysis, we design a Virtual
   Backbone (VB) construction algorithm, which aims to improve the spectrum
   utilization efficiency in CRNs. Finally, we conduct extensive
   simulations to validate our whitespace analysis and the VB construction
   algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that our social attributes
   based whitespace analysis can accurately characterize the whitespace in
   CRNs and the VB construction algorithm significantly improves the
   performance of the existing VB-based CRN protocols.}},

   region of arbitrary shape in an image, these descriptors are formed from
   shape-dependent scale spaces of oriented gradients. These scale spaces
   are defined by Poisson-like partial differential equations. A key
   property of our new descriptors is that they do not aggregate image data
   across the boundary of the region, in contrast to existing descriptors
   based on aggregation of oriented gradients. As an example, we show how
   the descriptor can be incorporated in a Mumford-Shah energy for texture
   segmentation. We test our method on several challenging datasets for
   texture segmentation and textured object tracking. Experiments indicate
   that our descriptors lead to more accurate segmentation than non-shape
   dependent descriptors and the state-of-the-art in texture segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose is a biodegradable, renewable, flexible, inexpensive
   biopolymer that is abundant in nature. However, due to its
   hydrophilicity, applications of cellulose (paper) in the handling of
   liquids are severely limited. Appropriate plasma-or glow
   discharge-assisted processing sequences can be used to modify the
   surface of cellulose/paper so that the interaction of liquids with these
   surfaces can be altered. In particular, nanostructures associated with
   crystalline regions of cellulose fibers can be uncovered by
   plasma-enhanced etching; subsequent plasma-enhanced fluorocarbon film
   deposition (similar to 100 nm) converts the surface into a
   superhydrophobic (static water contact angle > 150 degrees; receding
   contact angle < 8 degrees) state. Similar results can be obtained by
   depositing diamond-like carbon films on the plasmaetched surface, in
   spite of the inherently hydrophilic nature of diamond-like carbon
   itself. In addition, droplet adhesion and mobility can be controlled;
   depending on the etch cycle parameters, the paper surface can be
   rendered `roll-off' or `sticky' superhydrophobic. Use of a commercial
   printer to generate hydrophobic ink patterns on superhydrophobic paper
   surfaces allows controlled movement, transfer and storage of water or
   other aqueous liquids on the paper surface. These basic functionalities
   can be combined to design simple two-dimensional lab-on-paper (LOP)
   devices. Finally, by controlling both the cellulose fiber size and
   spacing, and depositing a fluorocarbon film, paper surfaces can be
   rendered superomniphobic, repelling both polar and apolar liquids.}},

Abstract = {{Online optimization-based controllers are becoming increasingly
   prevalent as a means to control complex high-dimensional nonlinear
   systems, e.g., bipedal and humanoid robots, due to their ability to
   balance multiple control objectives subject to input constraints.
   Motivated by these applications, the goal of this paper is to explore
   the continuity and smoothness properties of feedback controllers that
   are formulated as quadratic programs (QPs). We begin by drawing
   connections between these optimization-based controllers and a family of
   perturbed nonlinear programming problems commonly studied in operations
   research. With a view towards robotic systems, some existing results on
   perturbed nonlinear programming problems are extended and specialized to
   address conditions that arise when quadratic programs are used to
   enforce the convergence of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs).
   The main result of this paper is a novel set of conditions on the
   continuity of QPs that can be used when a subset of the constraints
   vanishes. A simulation study of position regulation in the compass gait
   biped demonstrates how the new conditions of this paper can be applied
   to more complex robotic systems.}},

   specification language, called Braid Temporal Logic (BTL), that allows
   us to specify rich, temporally-layered tasks involving agents' locations
   in an environment, their relative positions to each other, and frequency
   of location swaps and information exchanges between agents. We use
   techniques from formal methods to generate symbolic inputs that conform
   to a given BTL specification and use recently developed hybrid optimal
   control synthesis techniques to enact the synthesized pattern. The
   generated trajectories are provably guaranteed to be collision-free,
   respect physical boundaries of the agents' mission space, and to satisfy
   the high-level mission. Results are validated via implementation on a
   team of wheeled robots.}},

   primal-dual algorithm implemented in the hybrid architecture, which
   consists of a decentralized network of agents into which an updated dual
   vector is occasionally injected, and we establish its convergence
   properties. In this setting, a central cloud computer is responsible for
   aggregating information, computing dual variable updates, and
   distributing these updates to the agents. The agents update their
   (primal) state variables and also communicate among themselves with each
   agent sharing and receiving state information with some number of its
   neighbors. Throughout, communications with the cloud are not assumed to
   be synchronous or instantaneous, and communication delays are explicitly
   accounted for in the modeling and analysis of the system. Experimental
   results for a team of robots are presented to support the theoretical

   based optimization problem is proposed leveraging the framework of
   multi-domain hybrid systems. Utilizing a reference human gait coupled
   with physical constraints, the end result of this optimization problem
   is stable multi-contact prosthetic gaits that can be implemented on the

   walking robots-control Lyapunov function based quadratic programs
   coupled with variable impedance control-an online optimization-based
   controller is formulated to realize the designed gait in both simulation

   potential game. We develop a game-theoretic learning algorithm based on
   the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that solves the self-reconfiguration
   problem in a globally optimal fashion. Both a centralized and a fully
   decentralized algorithm are presented and we show that the only
   stochastically stable state is the potential function maximizer, i.e.
   the desired target configuration. These algorithms compute transition
   probabilities in such a way that even though each agent acts in a
   self-interested way, the overall collective goal of self-reconfiguration
   is achieved. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of our approach
   and show convergence to desired target configurations.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent work of ours we have proposed a theoretical framework for
   developing optimized scheduling policies for complex resource allocation
   systems (RAS). This framework is based heavily on the rigorous modeling
   of the RAS dynamics in the modeling framework of the Generalized
   Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs), and the employment of this framework
   towards the establishment of a systematic trade-off between the
   representational economy of the target scheduling policies and their
   operational efficiency. In this paper, we enhance the representational
   economy of the target policies in the aforementioned framework by taking
   advantage of some notions of ``(non-)conflict{''} in the transitional
   dynamics of the underlying RAS-modeling GSPNs. A series of numerical
   experiments demonstrate that the representational gains that are
   effected by the presented methodology can be very substantial.}},

Abstract = {{In asymmetric information zero-sum games, one player has superior
   information about the game over the other. Asymmetric information games
   are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker
   knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows
   the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is
   faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the
   cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically
   addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed
   player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit
   computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for
   repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal
   strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information
   stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the
   uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the
   security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal
   value. The results are illustrated on a stochastic intrusion detection
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, interconnected dynamical systems rely on communication in
   order to coordinate and compute appropriate control actions. Loss of
   communication links can exclude key decision makers from providing input
   and can even alter the system properties. This paper investigates the
   impact of communication loss on the controllability of a specific
   networked system, a homogeneous power-grid populated by
   producer-consumer hybrids. The notion of muteness is introduced in order
   to characterize the control policy adopted by the nodes which are
   isolated due to communication loss. We provide results which relates the
   controllability of such a system with mute nodes to the topology of the
   underlying electrical network and show that under certain topological
   conditions, controllability is preserved.}},

   strategy, then it will be a solution to a fixed point equation. Then, we
   show that for a sufficiently noisy environment, the functional fixed
   point equation leads to a contraction mapping, and hence, its iterations
   converge to a unique continuous threshold policy.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter is centered on fish-like aquatic robotics using flexible
   bimorphs made from Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) piezoelectric laminates.
   Bimorph propulsors employing MFCs offer a balance between the actuation
   force and velocity response for performance enhancement in bio-inspired
   swimming, in addition to noiseless and efficient actuation over a range
   of frequencies, geometric scalability, and simple design. The
   experimental component of this work first explores the effect of a
   passive substrate fin extension on the thrust frequency response of MFCs
   bimorphs in quiescent water along with measurement procedures.
   Specifically, it is shown that broadband thrust generation can be
   achieved in the presence of a passive substrate extension. The second
   part of the experiments is focused on the characterization of an
   elastically constrained uniform MFC bimorph propulsor (in-air and
   underwater) as well as the development of a robotic fish prototype
   combining a microcontroller and a printed circuit board amplifier to
   generate high actuation voltage for untethered locomotion. A
   distributed-parameter electroelastic model including the hydrodynamic
   effects and actuator dynamics is coupled with the elongated-body theory
   for estimating the mean thrust in quiescent water. For
   electroelastically nonlinear actuation levels, experimentally obtained
   underwater vibration response is coupled with the elongated-body theory
   to predict the thrust output. The measured mean thrust levels in
   quiescent water (on the order of similar to 10 mN) compare favorably
   with thrust levels of biological fish. An untethered robotic fish
   prototype that employs a single bimorph fin for straight swimming and
   turning motions is developed and tested in free locomotion. A swimming
   speed of 0.3 body length/s (7.5 cm/s swimming speed for 24.3 cm body
   length) is reported at 5 Hz for a nonoptimized main body-propulsor
   bimorph combination under a moderate actuation voltage level.}},

Abstract = {{This work is at the intersection of and integrates two broad
   considerations in the space industry, namely the emergence of the hosted
   payload paradigm on the one hand, and the increased emphasis for the
   acquisition of space systems to be value-driven on the other hand.
   Spacecraft, and hosted payloads, are value delivery artifacts; their
   value derives from the flow of service they provide to different
   stakeholders. Their design and acquisition should be value-centric or at
   a minimum value-informed.
   In this work, we first provide a value model and analysis for a
   spacecraft, which includes its lifecycle cost as well as its revenue
   model. The revenue model accounts for the services provided by the
   primary payload and their lease price, the loading dynamics, and various
   provisions for its obsolescence. When integrated, these two models allow
   us to calculate the spacecraft Net Present Value (NPV) and its return on
   investment. A sensitivity analysis helps us to identify the
   effectiveness of the different value levers of a spacecraft.
   Second, after a brief review of the hosted payload paradigm, and having
   developed a baseline spacecraft NPV model, we integrate considerations
   of the hosted payload into the value analysis, and in the process, we
   develop a pricing standard (and model) for hosted payloads. For the
   hosted payload business model to be sustainable, both main stakeholders
   in the transaction, the owner of the spacecraft (host) and that of the
   hosted payload (guest), have to see a net value in the hosting
   arrangement. We propose that the pricing of the hosted payload should be
   at a minimum Delta NPV neutral. This condition helps us calculate the
   lower bound for either an upfront payment from the guest, an annuity or
   rent-like payment, or a combination of both. We developed the analytics
   for this condition and the three payment options, and we extended it
   beyond the Delta NPV neutral baseline to include an X\% incremental
   return on the hosted payload. We conclude with a general reflection on
   value considerations in space systems and a series of analytical
   questions raised in this work and left as a fruitful venues for future
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Since the last two decades, aerospace agencies around the world have
   started planning Space-based Solar Power Systems ( SSPS) as an
   alternative power source {[} 1]-{[} 9]. The use of Space Shuttle Orbiter
   type re-usable launch vehicles will enable the completion of this
   project in a limited time span with economic feasibility. This would
   leave less time between successive launches, making it imperative that
   the aero-thermodynamic analysis of these vehicles be fast and accurate.
   Currently, aero-thermodynamic analysis is done by high fidelity
   Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD) solvers which are accurate but take
   significantly more time to give necessary results. Therefore, the
   present CFD solvers might not be useful tools for this mission to be
   completed in limited time. In this work a low cost, quick and reasonably
   accurate model is developed when compared with the CFD results {[} 10].
   Pressure coefficients and surface temperatures from this code are
   compared with results from the CFD solver of `Air Force Research Lab,

   cellular and WiFi systems in unlicensed spectrum. In the opportunistic
   method, the small cell base station opportunistically selects traffic
   offloading or resource sharing on each WiFi access point (AP). In the
   hybrid method, the base station simultaneously offloads users and shares
   the unlicensed spectrum of each AP. The performances of the proposed
   methods are analyzed and compared. We find that traffic offloading can
   achieve better performance than resource sharing when the number of
   existing WiFi users is below a threshold and the hybrid method achieves
   the same performance as the resource sharing method when existing WiFi
   user number is large enough. Numerical results are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Voice chat and conferencing services may be assumed to be private and

   stream. We show that information leakage is occurring in video over IP

   motion and scene changes, such as a person standing up or walking past a
   camera streaming live video. We accomplish this through analysis of
   network traffic metadata including arrival time between packets, packet
   sizes, and video stream bandwidth. Event detection through metadata
   analysis is possible even when common encryption techniques are applied
   to the video stream such as SSL or AES. We have observed information
   leakage across multiple codes and cameras. Through measurements of the
   x264 codec, we establish a basis for detectability of events via packet
   timing. Our laboratory experiments confirm that this event detection is
   possible and repeatable with commercial video streaming software.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the power control problem in an interference
   network with multiple users transmitting simultaneously on the same
   channel. We aim at achieving the energy efficiency (EE) balance among
   difference users. First, a multi-objective optimization problem is
   formulated, which maximizes the EE of each individual user while
   guaranteeing their minimum data rate requirements. To find its solution,
   we adopt two different scalarization methods to combine multiple
   objectives into a single one, namely, the weighted-sum method and the
   weighted Tchebycheff method. The problem in the weighted-sum method
   turns out to be a non-concave sum-of-ratios optimization and an
   effective algorithm is developed based on the concave-convex procedure
   (CCCP) method. On the other hand, the problem in the weighted
   Tchebycheff method becomes a generalized fractional programming and we
   utilize the Dinkelbach method and the CCCP method to solve it. Through
   numerical simulation, we find that both methods can effectively obtain
   the Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective optimization problem
   and achieve the EE balance among users as well.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz (0.1-10 THz) band communication is envisioned as a key
   technology to satisfy the increasing demand for ultra-high-speed
   wireless links. In this paper, a three dimensional (3D) end-to-end model
   is developed, which includes the graphene-based antenna response and the
   channel model in the THz band. The developed theoretical model is
   validated with COMSOL simulations. By using the developed 3D end-to-end
   model, an in-depth analysis on the 3D channel characteristics is carried
   out. In particular, the use of a 13-dB-gain antenna leads to the
   decrease of the delay spread from 0.2 ns to 3.2 ps, and the decrease of
   the angular spread by a factor of 20. The resulting coherence bandwidth
   reaches 63 GHz. A target capacity of 100 Gbps can be achieved with the
   directional antenna for the distance of 0.4 m over 0.8-0.9 THz, which is
   unreachable with the isotropic antenna. However, the directivity is at
   the cost of the strict antenna alignment, and the deviation needs to be
   smaller than 12.4 degrees. The provided analysis lays out the foundation
   for reliable and efficient ultra-high-speed wireless communications in
   the THz band.}},

   existing works mostly predict the trustworthiness of individual users
   separately from other users, ignoring the fact that users are related to
   each other through online social relationships. In this paper, we
   propose a probabilistic model based on Pairwise Markov Random Field
   (PMRF) that takes into account both user features and social
   relationships. In addition, we apply the Belief Propagation (BP)
   algorithm to perform inference efficiently in PMRF. The complexity of
   the algorithm grows only linear in the number of users. The experiment
   results on the Twitter datasets show that the proposed PMRF model can
   effectively exploit the social relationships to significantly improve
   the prediction performance.}},

Abstract = {{The quickest change detection problem is studied in two-state hidden
   Markov models (HMM), where the vector parameter. of the HMM may change
   from theta(0) to theta(1) at some unknown time, and one wants to detect
   the true change as quickly as possible while controlling the false alarm
   rate. It turns out that the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) scheme,
   while theoretically straightforward, is generally computationally
   infeasible for the HMM. To develop efficient but computationally simple
   schemes for the HMM, we first show that the recursive CUSUM scheme
   proposed in Fuh (Ann. Statist., 2003) can be regarded as a quasi-GLR
   scheme for some suitable pseudo post-change hypotheses. Next, we extend
   the quasi-GLR idea to propose recursive score schemes in a more
   complicated scenario when the post-change parameter theta(1) of the HMM
   involves a real-valued nuisance parameter. Finally, our research
   provides an alternative approach that can numerically compute the
   Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of two-state HMMs via the invariant
   probability measure and the Fredholm integral equation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication between biological entities is a new paradigm in
   which biological nodes sense the environment, communicate and cooperate
   with each other. Ligand receptors are among the most common mechanisms
   used by biological entities such as bacteria to sense the molecular
   signals in their surroundings. In such a mechanism, molecules (i.e.,
   ligands) bind to certain proteins (i.e., receptors) and activate a
   signaling cascade inside the cell. In this paper, we study the
   distortion in sensing and estimation of the concentration of molecular
   signals by ligand receptors in biological agents. The sensing distortion
   is caused by both the randomness in the ligand reception and the
   quantization of the final receiver output. The random measurement of the
   signal by the binding activity differentiates this case from classical
   quantization problems. We propose an optimal random quantization
   technique that minimizes the overall distortion described above. The
   performance of this optimal technique is compared with a uniform
   quantizer design and the regions where the optimal quantizer can offer a
   considerable advantage are identified. Furthermore, we analyze the
   effect of the number of the output levels (i.e., the output rate) on the
   overall distortion compared with the theoretical limit given by Shannon.
   Following this, the best practical number of levels beyond which no
   significant improvement can be made is presented.}},

   consider the (now) usual matrix recovery formulation through maximum

   and establish theoretical upper and lower bounds on the recovery error.
   Our bounds are nearly optimal up to a factor on the order of
   O(log(d(1)d(2))). These bounds are obtained by adapting the arguments
   used for one-bit matrix completion {[}1] (although these two problems
   are different in nature) and the adaptation requires new techniques
   exploiting properties of the Poisson likelihood function and tackling
   the difficulties posed by the locally sub-Gaussian characteristic of the
   Poisson distribution. Our results highlight a few important distinctions

Abstract = {{The development of automated production systems requires the
   collaborative effort of a variety of stakeholders from different
   disciplines. In model-based systems engineering, stakeholders address
   their specific concerns by forming a number of views using models.
   Because of the multi-disciplinary nature of automated production
   systems, a variety of modelling languages, formalisms and tools is
   typically employed. Nevertheless, the aggregation of models is nowadays
   limited by the communication between stakeholders and interdisciplinary
   understanding. Therefore, in order to achieve a positive outcome of the
   design process it is crucial that the models are free of
   inconsistencies. As a first step, this paper describes challenges
   related to managing inconsistencies in models of systems from the domain
   of automated production systems. A conceptual approach that uses
   semantic web technologies and a technology demonstrator illustrating the
   technical viability of the approach are shown. Finally, requirements for
   a discipline-spanning inconsistency management framework are derived
   based on the presented challenges and initial findings from applying the
   approach to a demonstration case. (C) 2015, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Modern high speed communication systems often employ both analog and
   digital blocks. This poses a challenge for simulation of closed loop
   system dynamics in presence of non-idealities in any of the analog
   blocks. Due to the size and complexity of such systems it is not
   possible to do full system level simulation with circuit level models.
   The presence of digital control blocks makes it difficult to elevate
   block level observations to system level performance. A major challenge
   is the difficulty in estimating the error rate at the output of digital
   latches (continuous-time to discrete-time domain crossing boundaries) in
   the presence of noise and non-ideal analog input signals. Simplistic
   models used currently are often inadequate in capturing the long term
   effects of non ideal behavior at the block level. In this paper we
   propose a simulation framework to estimate latch transition
   probabilities in the response to distorted input and clock waveforms in
   presence of white noise. The evaluated transition probabilities can then
   be used to estimate system performance in an event driven Markov chain
   based model.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent past, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been
   proposed as a way of implementing security in modern ICs. PUFs are
   hardware designs that exploit the randomness in silicon manufacturing
   processes to create IC-specific signatures for silicon authentication.
   While prior PUF designs have been largely digital, in this work we
   propose a novel PUF design based on transfer function variability of an
   analog push-pull amplifier under process variations. A differential
   amplifier architecture is proposed with digital interfaces to allow the
   PUF to be used in digital as well as mixed-signal SoCs. A key innovation
   is digital stimulus engineering for the analog amplifier that allows 2X
   improvements in the uniqueness of IC signatures generated over
   arbiter-based digital PUF architectures, while maintaining high
   signature reliability over +/- 10 \% voltage and -20 to 120 degree
   Celsius temperature variation. The proposed PUF is also resistive to
   model building attacks as the internal analog operation of the PUF is
   difficult to reverse-engineer due to the continuum of internal states
   involved. We show the benefits of the proposed PUF through comparison
   with a traditional arbiter-based digital PUF using simulation
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a significant interest in Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic

   on the reliability in this technology but various fault manifestations
   have not been studied in detail in the past. This paper attempts to
   study the fault models in STT-MRAM under both parametric variations as
   well as electrical defects (opens and shorts). Sensitivity of Read,
   Write and Retention to material and lithographic process parameters has
   been studied. Also electrical defects viz. intra-cell and inter-cell

Abstract = {{Die stacking memory technology can enable gigascale DRAM caches that can
   operate at 4x-8x higher bandwidth than commodity DRAM. Such caches can
   improve system performance by servicing data at a faster rate when the
   requested data is found in the cache, potentially increasing the memory
   bandwidth of the system by 4x-8x. Unfortunately, a DRAM cache uses the
   available memory bandwidth not only for data transfer on cache hits, but
   also for other secondary operations such as cache miss detection, fill
   on cache miss, and write back lookup and content update on dirty
   evictions from the last-level on-chip cache. Ideally, we want the
   bandwidth consumed for such secondary operations to be negligible, and
   have almost all the bandwidth be available for transfer of useful data
   from the DRAM cache to the processor.
   We evaluate a 1 GB DRAM cache, architected as Alloy Cache, and show that
   even the most bandwidth-efficient proposal for DRAM cache consumes 3.8x
   bandwidth compared to an idealized DRAM cache that does not consume any
   bandwidth for secondary operations. We also show that redesigning the
   DRAM cache to minimize the bandwidth consumed by secondary operations
   can potentially improve system performance by 22\%. To that end, this
   paper proposes Bandwidth Efficient ARchitecture (BEAR) for DRAM caches.
   BEAR integrates three components, one each for reducing the bandwidth
   consumed by miss detection, miss fill, and writeback probes. BEAR
   reduces the bandwidth consumption of DRAM cache by 32\%, which reduces
   cache hit latency by 24\% and increases overall system performance by
   10\%. BEAR, with negligible overhead, outperforms an idealized SRAM
   Tag-Store design that incurs an unacceptable overhead of 64 megabytes,
   as well as Sector Cache designs that incur an SRAM storage overhead of 6
   megabytes.}},

Title = {{EXPLORING THE APPROACHES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIM-BASED MEP
   COORDINATION IN THE USA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION}},

Abstract = {{The design coordination of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP)
   systems is a manual process conducted during preconstruction phase of
   building projects. The difficulties associated with the conventional MEP
   coordination process have resulted in extensive efforts to enhance the
   process through utilization of BIM technology. The widespread adoption
   of BIM technology by AEC (architecture/engineering/construction) firms
   has given rise to new means and methods of conducting MEP coordination.
   However, there is limited knowledge about various approaches that are
   currently practiced as BIM-based coordination. Also, there is a need to
   identify information items and metrics needed to properly capture and
   measure the effect of BIM on enhancing coordination process. The major
   objective of this study is to capture the underpinnings of BIM-based
   coordination process as currently practiced by AEC firms in the U.S. A
   nationwide survey was conducted to capture the subject matter experts'
   opinions in the following areas of BIM-based coordination: (1) Current
   approaches of conducting coordination using BIM; (2) Information items
   collected to monitor coordination process; (3) Factors affecting
   coordination production rate; (4) Metrics used by AEC companies to
   measure production rate; and (5) Identified best practices leveraged by
   companies to enhance BIM utilization in the coordination process. The
   findings of this study indicated that ``remote coordination{''} and
   ``regular coordination{''} are the most widely used BIM-based
   coordination approaches. Number of clashes resolved in each meeting, BIM
   competency of team members, and number of trades attending meetings were
   identified as the most commonly collected information items by AEC firms
   throughout the MEP coordination process. Team experience level,
   preliminary design quality, and MEP system complexity were found as the
   most important factors that impact the MEP coordination process. Several
   best practices were recommend by participants in this study to improve
   the efficiency of MEP coordination process. These strategies were
   described under the four different phases of an MEP project: initiation
   and planning, 3D modeling, MEP coordination, and construction and
   installation. The results of this study are expected to enhance our
   knowledge about differences among various BIM-based coordination
   approaches, their popularity among practitioners, and their effects on
   the coordination progress. The findings of this research will help AEC
   firms by describing information requirements for establishing a
   procedure to track, measure, and compare MEP coordination progress
   across different construction projects.}},

   BUILDING PROTOCOL CONTROL AND DATA VISUALIZATION}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{As construction job sites get larger and more complex, the need to
   maintain building protocol is becoming more necessary. Having a
   real-time tracking system for materials, equipment and personnel
   installed on a job site can help project managers to enhance the
   security, safety, quality control, worker logistics, and maintain local
   ordinances of a construction project. In this paper we will present the
   method of integrating passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) for real-time tracking of personnel.
   The purpose of this research is to utilize RFID-BIM integration to
   generate real-time data to produce leading indicators for building
   protocol control. Building protocol includes monitoring safety,
   security, and verification of maintaining the San Francisco Office of
   Economic and Workforce Development hiring mandate. Hardware components
   include passive RFID tags, portal RFID readers, fixed turn-style
   readers, and mobile handheld devices, and a cloud server. The system was
   deployed on a 900,000 square feet hospital project that consisted of
   three major buildings, 125 contractors, and 1,200 workers. An algorithm
   is presented that reduces and organizes the data that the system
   produces. Linking RFID into industry foundation classes (IFC) has been
   highlighted. Preliminary results show that the integration of these
   technologies produces data that is used in real-time resource tracking,
   data analysis, ordinance compliance, and zone safety violations.
   Additionally, the system also provided real-time visualization
   information that can provide a variety of benefits. Significantly, based
   on experimental analysis, we demonstrate that the RFID and BIM system is
   a practical and resourceful tool to provide real-time information and
   location tracking to maintain building protocol control.}},

   articulation, can be better modelled by a deep neural network. In this
   work, we propose the use of deep neural network trained on telephone
   bandwidth material from different languages to improve the proposed
   universal acoustic characterisation. We demonstrate that deeper neural
   architectures enhance the attribute classification accuracy.
   Furthermore, we show that improvements in attribute classification carry
   over to foreign accent recognition by producing a 21\% relative
   improvement over previous baseline on spoken Finnish, and a 5.8\%
   relative improvement on spoken English.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework to automatically construct a collection of
   high-resolution (HR) language-universal units for spoken language
   identification (LID). Based on the popular phone recognition language
   modeling (PRLM) approach to LID, a set of universal attribute
   recognizers (UARs) is first established to replace phone recognizers
   (PRs) using manner and place of articulation as attribute units and
   context-dependent (CD) attribute models are then built to achieve
   high-performance attribute transcription. To alleviate the difficulty of
   data sparsity in n-gram language modeling (LM) of these CD units, a
   clustering algorithm is proposed to compact the number of utilized
   attribute units in LM. Tested on the 2009 National Institute of
   Standards and Technology Language Recognition Evaluation for the 30-sec
   task using the same English Switchboard-I training data for acoustic
   modeling, our proposed approach achieves an equal error rate (EER) of
   2.34\%, representing a relative EER reduction of over 20\% from the
   results of 2.88\% obtained with the conventional PRLM techniques. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first time a single UAR based LID
   system significantly outperforms a signal PR based system with the same
   set of training data from a single language.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an entropy minimization dialog management (DM) strategy for
   goal-driven information retrieval (IR). By associating each goal of an
   IR task with a set of stochastic attributes, reaching a goal can then be
   accomplished by filling the ``attribute slots{''} corresponding to the
   goal. Information access can now be cast as a dialog problem that
   specific information about the attributes is solicited from a user by
   the system through multiple dialog turns. For a real-world music search
   task with 38118 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song, we
   demonstrate the concept by designing a simulation game to order song
   from the above music database. We show that 8.3 dialog turns are needed
   on the average if random questions are asked by the system, whereas the
   entropy minimization DM is a very efficient goal seeking method to order
   a song with the least amount of 3.3 dialog turns among different
   strategies. Furthermore, the proposed DM techniques can manage the
   dialog process in a more efficient and flexible manner.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel approach to addressing the adaptation effectiveness
   issue in parameter adaptation for deep neural network (DNN) based
   acoustic models for automatic speech recognition by adding one or more
   small auxiliary output layers modeling broad acoustic units, such as
   mono-phones or tied-state (often called senone) clusters. In scenarios
   with a limited amount of available adaptation data, most senones are
   usually rarely seen or not observed, and consequently the ability to
   model them in a new condition is often not fully exploited. With the
   original senone classification task as the primary task, and adding
   auxiliary mono-phone/senone-cluster classification as the secondary
   tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) is employed to adapt the DNN
   parameters. With the proposed MTL adaptation framework, we improve the
   learning ability of the original DNN structure, then enlarge the
   coverage of the acoustic space to deal with the unseen senone problem,
   and thus enhance the discrimination power of the adapted DNN models.
   Experimental results on the 20,000-word open vocabulary WSJ task
   demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the
   conventional linear hidden layer adaptation schemes without MTh by
   providing 5.4\% relative reduction in word error rate (WERR) with only 1
   single adaptation utterance, and 10.7\% WERR with 40 adaptation
   utterances against the un-adapted DNN models.}},

Abstract = {{The organizational design of a multi-agent system (MAS) is important for
   its efficiency, adaptability and robustness. However, finding suitable
   organizational structures for different MASs is a challenging problem.
   In this paper, we propose a Framework of Evolutionary Optimization for
   Agent Organizations (FEVOR) based on Genetic Programming for optimizing
   tree-structured MASs. FEVOR employs a flexible representation of
   organizations and may be applied to a wide range of organizational forms
   such as pure hierarchies, holarchies, and federations. Compared to
   existing work, FEVOR is capable of efficient quantitative search and
   less vulnerable to stalling at local optima due to its non-greedy
   nature. Extensive experiments for optimizing an information retrieval
   system have been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of FEVOR in
   generating suitable MAS organizations for adaptive environments.}},

Abstract = {{A fully passive low-cost wireless UHF REID antenna based sensor for
   Internet of Things applications is presented. The proposed sensor
   consists of a closely spaced two element dipole antenna with a printed
   sensor electrically connected to one of the antennas. A
   metamaterial-inspired resonator is used to improve isolation between the
   two antennas and optimize the size of the antenna structure. The
   radiating and sensing structure is inkjet-printed on photo-paper using a
   silver nanoparticle ink, and commercial REID chips are connected to each
   of the two antenna terminals. The tag dimensions are 84mm x 89mm and the
   tag is compatible with an EPC Class 1 Gen 2 (UHF) standard reader
   operating at 915 MHz. The design methodoly of the sensor as well as
   theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a tunable metamaterial (MM) absorber that
   incorporates novel microfluidic channels and is realized using inkjet
   printing on a photo-paper substrate. The fabricated sample demonstrated

   from 4.42 to 3.97 GHz when the empty channels were filled with
   de-ionized water. An analysis of the results suggests that microfluidic
   technology is a simpler and more effective way to achieve tuning
   functionality. The proposed structure is the first microfluidic absorber

Abstract = {{Presently, more than 7 million Haitians have no access to power nor
   basic energy related services. Available generation capacity of Haiti
   reaches 212 MW, which is insufficient to meet the estimated peak demand
   of more than 500 MW in the whole country. This deficit severely impacts
   basic essential facilities such as health care centers. The IEEE Student
   Branch PES Chapter at Georgia Tech established a project to design and
   implement a microgrid to supply power to a recently established health
   center in the mountains of Thoman, Haiti. Several combinations of power
   generating units were evaluated on an economic basis, including: a
   standalone diesel generator (DG), photovoltaic (PV) panels with
   batteries, and PV panels with batteries and a DG. Key parameters
   including power rating, daily energy production, maximum annual capacity
   shortage, etc., were also incorporated into the economic evaluation.
   This paper outlines the preliminary microgrid design steps, assessment
   of topology alternatives, site visit, detailed design and the
   fundraising process. Only commercial off-the-shelf parts were considered
   for device selection. To verify the preliminary design, a site visit was
   conducted in February 2015. Installation and commissioning is expected
   to take place later this year.}},

Abstract = {{For individuals with a motor skill disorder, repetition of recommended
   therapy exercises is essential for motor improvement. Moreover, external
   feedback of performance is an important component of therapy such that
   individuals can correct their exercises and improve their performance.
   However, direct feedback is typically only provided by an expert
   therapist during weekly or monthly therapy sessions, which limits
   improvement on a daily basis. In order to promote the repetition of
   recommended exercises in a home setting, several serious games have been
   developed to promote compliance with therapy interventions. To advance
   this work, we have developed a novel framework to couple serious games
   with a robot playmate that provides corrective feedback during
   interaction. The playmate continuously tracks the user's kinematic
   performance and autonomously provides objective verbal and nonverbal
   cues in order to increase the efficacy of the intervention. To determine
   how various cues affect an individual's kinematic performance, we have
   tested the complete system with 20 able-bodied adults. Namely, we
   computed the total amount of time it took the participants to
   successfully complete a reaching task as a function of the verbal or
   nonverbal cues received. The results show that movement times improve at
   a faster rate for the group provided with both verbal and nonverbal
   feedback versus verbal feedback alone. Exit surveys also suggest that
   the system was deemed enjoyable by the targeted population.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of preferences for modern highly-configurable software
   systems has become extremely complex, usually consisting of multiple
   layers of access that go from the user interface down to the lowest
   levels of the source code. This complexity can lead to inconsistencies
   between layers, especially during software evolution. For example, there
   may be preferences that users can change through the GUI, but that have
   no effect on the actual behavior of the system because the related
   source code is not present or has been removed going from one version to
   the next. These inconsistencies may result in unexpected program
   behaviors, which range in severity from mild annoyances to more critical
   security or performance problems. To address this problem, we present
   SCIC (Software Configuration Inconsistency Checker), a static analysis
   technique that can automatically detect these kinds of inconsistencies.
   Unlike other configuration analysis tools, SCIC can handle software that
   (1) is written in multiple programming languages and (2) has a complex
   preference structure. In an empirical evaluation that we performed on 10
   years worth of versions of both the widely used Mozilla Core and
   Firefox, SCIC was able to find 40 real inconsistencies (some determined
   as severe), whose lifetime spanned multiple versions, and whose
   detection required the analysis of code written in multiple languages.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a single-hop, random-access, wireless sensor network (WSN)
   performing sequential distributed detection under a bandwidth
   constraint. At each time slot, the sensor nodes will make their
   decisions on whether the observed event is happening. The sensor
   censoring strategy is applied such that only the local decisions equal
   to one (i.e., the event happens) will be sent to the fusion center (FC).
   Because only one transmission channel between the FC and the sensor
   nodes is assumed, if two or more local decisions are sent at a time
   slot, a packet collision happens. We design a sequential probability
   ratio test (SPRT) at the FC that is aware of the collisions. The
   performance measures of the collision-aware SPRT are analyzed based on a
   Markov chain. In addition, we derive the asymptotic relative efficiency
   of the collision-aware SPRT relative to another SPRT. Numerical results
   show some interesting characteristics of the collision-aware SPRT. For
   example, the collision-aware SPRT prefers the scenario that many local
   decisions are likely to be sent per time slot.}},

Abstract = {{Software Defined Network has a centralized controller that regulates
   packet forwarding by updating flow tables of switches. The sole
   responsibility of these OpenFlow-enabled switches is to forward packets
   according to rules in their flow tables. The function of Software
   Defined Network is similar to the traditional IPTV protocol that there
   are Rendezvous Point be the intermediate node. Rendezvous Point is a
   node in the network that creates routing between servers and clients.
   This paper proposes an application of SDN/OpenFlow in IPTV multicasting
   implementation. An important function of IPTV multicasting is the
   Joint/Leave request of client in a multicast group. In order to obtain
   an efficient IPTV service routing, Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms were
   used to comparatively calculate minimum total edge weight. Mininet
   environment is used to emulate our system, which consists of Open
   vSwitch and a POX controller. Our experiments compare the transmission
   time of the first joint/receive packet to a client when using Dijkstra's
   and Prim's algorithms. We define the edge weight as the distance between
   two adjacent nodes.}},

Abstract = {{We study an SIS epidemic model over an arbitrary connected network
   topology when the agents receive personalized information about the
   current epidemic state. The agents utilize their available information
   to either reduce interactions with their neighbors (social distancing)
   when they believe the epidemic is currently prevalent or resume normal
   interactions when they believe there is low risk of becoming infected.
   The information is a weighted combination of three sources: 1) the
   average states of nodes in contact neighborhoods 2) the average states
   of nodes in an information network 3) a global broadcast of the average
   epidemic state of the network. A 2(n) - state Markov Chain is first
   considered to model the disease dynamics with awareness, from which a
   mean-field discrete-time n-state dynamical system is derived, where each
   state corresponds to an agent's probability of being infected. The
   nonlinear model is a lower bound of its linearized version about the
   origin. Hence, global stability of the origin (the disease-free
   equilibrium) in the linear model implies global stability in the
   nonlinear model. When the origin is not stable, we show the existence of
   a nontrivial fixed point in the awareness model, which obeys a strict
   partial order in relation to the nontrivial fixed point of the dynamics
   without distancing. In simulations, we define two performance metrics to
   understand the effectiveness agent awareness has in reducing the spread
   of an epidemic.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis and design of present machining methods used in mechanical
   engineering are based on Taylor series approximations and linearizations
   which cause erroneous and anomalous results. High precision machining
   cannot tolerate such errors. We consider and analyze an exact
   mathematical model of the turning process without performing any kind of
   linearization of the model. We give a strategic design of an estimator
   for the position of a machining tool based on first principles. The
   system's dynamics are characterized by a nonlinear State-Dependent Delay
   Differential Equation (SD-DDE). This delay is extremely convoluted with
   the state by an implicit relation. The central tenet is to use inversion
   of the delay model and to extract the state vector given the delay. We
   use our recently developed observation technique referred to as Delay
   Injection. Both linear asymptotic and nonlinear observers with different
   architectures are designed for the state estimation of a machine tool
   based on state-dependent delay measurement. Simulation results are
   depicted at the end which portray the effectiveness, validity and
   usefulness of the proposed observer schemes.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a mixture procedure to monitor parallel streams of data for a
   change-point that causes gradual change of a subset of data streams. We
   model the gradual change as a change in the trends of the affected data
   streams. Observations are assumed initially to be independent standard
   normal random variables with zero mean. After a change-point the
   observations in a subset of the streams of data have mean values that
   increase or decrease with time. The rate of change for the affected
   sensors may be different for the affected sensors. The subset and the
   post-change means are unknown but we assume the number of affected
   sensors is small. Our procedure uses a mixture statistics which
   hypothesizes an assumed fraction p(0) of affected data streams. An
   analytic expression is obtained for the average run length (ARL) when
   there is no change and is shown by simulations to be very accurate.
   Similarly, an approximation for the expected detection delay (EDD) after
   a change-point is also obtained. Numerical examples based on real-data
   demonstrate the good performance of the proposed procedure on real data.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of efficient parallel graph algorithms is important for
   quickly solving problems in areas such as urban planning, social network
   analysis, and hardware verification. Existing GPU implementations of
   graph algorithms tend to be monolithic and thus contributions from the
   literature are typically rebuilt rather than reused. Recent work has
   focused on traversal-based abstractions that efficiently execute a
   single breadth-first search or enact algorithms in the ``think like a
   vertex{''} paradigm. However, graph analytics such as the all-pairs
   shortest paths problem, diameter computations, betweenness centrality,
   and reachability querying require the execution of many such graph
   traversals. Typically, these traversals are independent of one another
   and can thus be executed in parallel.
   This paper presents multi-search, a simple abstraction that is designed
   for graph algorithms requiring many breadth-first searches that can be
   executed simultaneously. Although algorithms have implicitly leveraged
   this abstraction in the past, we provide an explicit, reusable
   implementation that efficiently maps this abstraction to the GPU,
   performing more than twice as fast as previous approaches on large
   graphs of varying diameter. This approach allows us to scale our APSP
   implementation to graphs with millions of vertices using a single GPU
   whereas prior approaches were either constrained to much smaller graph
   instances or required large supercomputers to process graphs of similar
   size. To show the flexibility of our abstraction, we use it to express
   betweenness centrality and achieve more than a 5.82x average speedup
   over parallel CPU implementations from existing frameworks and a 2.24x
   average speedup over a manual, highly optimized GPU implementation of
   the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{While the notion of self-awareness has a long history in biology,
   psychology, medicine, engineering and (more recently) computing, we are
   seeing the emerging need for self-awareness in the context of complex
   Systems-on-Chip that must address the often conflicting requirements of
   performance, resiliency, energy, cost, etc. in the face of highly
   dynamic operational behaviors coupled with process, environment, and
   workload variabilities. Unlike traditional Systems-on-Chip (SoCs),
   self-aware SoCs must deploy an intelligent co-design of the control,
   communication, and computing infrastructure that interacts with the
   physical environment in real-time in order to modify the systems
   behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and
   Quality-of-Service (QoS). Self-aware SoCs require a combination of
   ubiquitous sensing and actuation, health-monitoring, and self-learning
   to enable the SoCs adaptation over time and space. This special session
   targets self-learning and self-awareness in two domains. The first one
   is a self-learning runtime reliability prediction approach by reusing
   Design-for-Test (DfT) infrastructure. The other one discusses real-time
   systems and applications to wireless communication, signal processing
   and control.}},

Abstract = {{Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder for which millions of
   people worldwide experience seizures. To diagnose these seizures for
   treatment, a patient typically stays in the hospital for days while a
   clinical staff must manually screen hours of electroencephalograph (EEG)
   data for electroencephalographic and behavioral seizures, a very
   time-consuming, tedious, and subjective process for humans. While
   decades of research have been dedicated to algorithms for alleviating
   this clinical procedural burden, there is still room for improvement in
   seizure detection techniques. Moreover, most seizure detection
   strategies use supervised machine learning, which requires subjective
   human involvement for training data. This research examines seizure
   detection performance for 24 patients using k-means, k-mediod, and
   hierarchical clustering, a Gaussian mixture model, and a hidden Markov
   model after using principal component analyses to reduce 45 measures to
   2 measures. This work differs from past unsupervised methods, which were
   tested using very experimentally controlled seizure and non-seizure EEG
   signals: analyzing continuous EEG spanning 60 seconds pre-seizure to 60
   seconds post-seizure in overlapping sliding windows rather than a single
   point for each seizure and non-seizure epoch. The `best' combination of
   classifier accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, selectivity, and
   rejectivity is found with k-means and k-mediod algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of energy storage technologies is being recognised by
   more and more power system professionals lately. If properly designed,
   installed and operated, storage can provide flexibility, and be a
   valuable component of future electricity networks. Although regulatory
   and market conditions still have to be improved, the potential of energy
   storage is unequivocal. As power companies are seeking best practices of
   utilising storage units, a demand arises for accurate modelling.
   Present paper introduces steady state and dynamic modelling options for
   generic energy storage technologies, developed for DIgSILENT
   PowerFactory. Primary aim of the authors was to design a flexible and
   versatile structure that allows the user to implement arbitrary storage
   strategies and to compare the performance of different technological
   options. In the first part of the paper, an overview is given on
   existing models. As it is shown, majority of the models are only capable
   of simulating a single storage technology. In the second part of the
   paper, the steady state and dynamic models are detailed, emphasizing
   important differences compared to existing ones. Finally, selected case
   studies are shown to demonstrate the operation of the models under

Abstract = {{Increased penetration of variable resources mainly in the form of wind
   and PV plants creates new challenges to power system operation, in the
   form of increased thermal unit cycling, ramping requirements and
   increased capacity reserve requirements. One approach is to address
   these issues by utilizing the increased flexibility offered by energy
   storage devices (utility and customer owned), distributed responsive
   load and thermally controlled loads. The flexible resources come with
   their own set of physical and customer convenience constraints to their
   flexibility. In this paper, the flexible power system operation problem
   is cast as a multi-step OPF problem which includes transition
   constraints of flexible dynamic resources and customer requirements. The
   flexible resource constraints are derived from their physically-based
   model and imposing the ``no customer inconvenience{''} requirement.
   Model, objectives and constraints are expressed with quadratized models
   (objects) leading to an object-oriented quadratic flexible OPF. An
   efficient solution algorithm with good convergence properties is
   presented. Initial results in a sample system are also presented.}},

   decelerating mechanical loads, there is a potential to recover stored
   kinetic energy during braking events. However, this potential cannot be
   fully realized without proper design of the braking controller, since
   electric machine braking may be either regenerative or non-regenerative.
   This paper develops a novel method for designing regenerative braking

Abstract = {{Accurate location information is crucial for wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs). It is quite challenging to achieve a balance between
   localization accuracy and cost. Recently, a dual-tone radio
   interferometric positioning system (DRIPS) and a DRIPS with
   undersampling techniques (uDRIPS) are proposed, respectively. Thanks to
   the special design of the dual-tone signal, both DRIPS and uDRIPS are
   robust to flat-fading channels. They provide promising options to
   achieve high accuracy with low cost. In this paper, we evaluate the
   performance of the ranging algorithms of DRIPS and uDRIPS using National
   Instruments' PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (NI PXI). Although both
   DRIPS and uDRIPS employ the same dual-tone signal, their ranging methods
   are different. DRIPS extracts the range-related phase information of a
   low-frequency signal created by squaring the received dual-tone signal,
   while uDRIPS directly samples the received dual-tone signal to estimate
   the phase information. The experimental results show that the average
   errors of the ranging algorithms of uDRIPS and DRIPS can be as small as
   11 cm at a range of 5 m. Moreover, the ranging performance of uDRIPS
   outperforms that of DRIPS, as the squaring operation in DRIPS amplifies
   the noise.}},

Abstract = {{Query auto-completion (QAC) plays an important role in assisting users
   typing less while submitting a query. The QAC engine generally offers a
   list of suggested queries that start with a user's input as a prefix,
   and the list of suggestions is changed to match the updated input after
   the user types each keystroke. Therefore rich user interactions can be
   observed along with each keystroke until a user clicks a suggestion or
   types the entire query manually. It becomes increasingly important to
   analyze and understand users' interactions with the QAC engine, to
   improve its performance. Existing works on QAC either ignored users'
   interaction data, or assumed that their interactions at each keystroke
   are independent from others. Our paper pays high attention to users'
   sequential interactions with a QAC engine in and across QAC sessions,
   rather than users' interactions at each keystroke of each QAC session
   separately. Analyzing the dependencies in users' sequential interactions
   improves our understanding of the following three questions: 1) how is a
   user's skipping/viewing move at the current keystroke influenced by that
   at the previous keystroke? 2) how to improve search engines' query
   suggestions at short keystrokes based on those at latter long
   keystrokes? and 3) facing a targeted query shown in the suggestion list,
   why does a user decide to continue typing rather than click the intended
   suggestion? We propose a probabilistic model that addresses those three
   questions in a unified way, and illustrate how the model determines
   users' final click decisions. By comparing with state-of-the-art
   methods, our proposed model does suggest queries that better satisfy
   users' intents.}},

   distort earth magnetic field around them. Motivated by this observation,
   this paper presents a way-finding method utilizing a magnetic tensor
   sensor (MTS) to help visually impaired people avoid ferrous obstacles

   of digital three-axis magnetic field sensors, the MTS simultaneously
   measures magnetic flux densities and magnetic tensor; the latter
   effectively eliminates the influence of geomagnetic field and enables
   the use of a single tensor-based parameter Q which increases
   exponentially when approaching an object for obstacle avoidance. A
   prototype MTS has been developed and its performance has been
   experimentally evaluated with two practical applications; outdoor
   obstacle avoidance and indoor navigation using only 1D map incorporating
   magnetic waypoints and an improved dynamic time warping method to
   estimate locations from the real-time measurements and pre-stored map. A
   method to enhance critical waypoints (such as stair) on magnetic map

Abstract = {{In general, the physical field in a domain can be uniquely determined
   from appropriate physical laws by its field conditions on its boundary
   surfaces. In machining, the ability to measure the tool surface
   temperature distribution is highly desirable as it provides an essential
   basis to reconstruct the thermal model for monitoring tool and workpiece
   conditions, particularly when machining hard to machine materials (such
   as titanium alloy that exhibits excellent mechanical properties and
   corrosion resistance). Because of the extremely high temperature
   gradient within a very small area, the need for developing an effective
   non-contact measurement technique has been a well-recognized problem. In
   the context of dry lathe-turning of titanium alloy, this paper presents
   a method based on non-contact infrared images to reconstruct the
   temperature field of the tool insert. Unlike traditional methods that
   base on limited thermocouple measurements or direct reading of absolute
   temperature from infrared images, the method presented here utilizes
   physical laws and heat transfer properties (temperature contours and
   their gradients) to identify thermal discontinuities, separate chips
   from the tool insert and reconstruct the obtruded tool temperature
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration suppression in milling thin-wall components (which are widely
   used aircraft wing structures, turbine blades and jet engine compressor)
   is essential for improving workpiece surface integrity. Dynamic
   deflections of flexible workpiece in milling are spatially distributed,
   and must be derived from the part vibration. To effectively control the
   dynamic deflections encountered in flexible workpiece milling, as well
   as avoid any potential interference between vibrated workpiece being
   machined and cutter, the paper presents a vibration suppression strategy
   employing machining parameter optimization for solving using time-FEA.
   Along with a distributed-parameter model that takes into account the
   workpiece dynamic deformation due to time-varying cutting forces, a new
   metric is defined for evaluating the vibration response of the workpiece
   during milling, upon which a minimax optimization is formulated as a
   sequential linear programming problem to minimize the vibration response
   metric subject to a set of specified constraints (imposed by process
   stability as well as chatter-free and minimum material removal rate
   requirements). An AL7075 blade with a relatively complex free-form
   surface was numerically simulated to illustrate the dynamics responses
   of the spatially distributed nodal points on a thin-wall workpiece, and
   demonstrate the application of the vibration response metric for
   optimizing the spindle speed subject to a specified set of constraints.}},

Abstract = {{As multicore processor architectures are now prevalent in server nodes
   of parallel and distributed computing systems, it has become important
   to characterize the performance of applications run on these

   application experiences from memory interference due to other
   applications co-located on cores of the same multicore processor. We
   propose a methodology for designing models that are capable of utilizing
   varying amounts of information relating to an application and its
   co-located applications to predict the application's execution time
   performance degradation due to co-location. We evaluate the models using
   several application co-location scenarios based on real world test data

Abstract = {{LTE-A as a cellular technology has gained tremendous importance in
   recent years due to its high data-rates and improved data access for
   mobile devices. Recently, utilizing the unlicensed band as a
   supplementary band for LTE-A is being considered to expand the capacity
   of mobile systems. License-assisted access using LTE (LAA-LTE) will thus
   operate in the unlicensed band, and will operate in a spectrum that
   overlaps with Wi-Fi, another popular unlicensed-band technology. The
   concern is that LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi are unlikely to have mechanisms to
   directly coordinate with each other to address channel-sharing issues.
   In this paper, we study the interference impact of LAA-LTE on Wi-Fi
   under various network conditions using purely experimental analysis in
   indoor environments. The following three questions are specifically
   considered in this paper: (1) What are the implications of LAA-LTE usage
   on Wi-Fi? (2) How should LAA-LTE or Wi-Fi be configured for Wi-Fi to be
   less impacted? (3) How should the LAA-LTE MAC protocol be designed to be
   gracefully co-exist with Wi-Fi? To answer the above questions, we
   present comprehensive experimental results and give insights based on
   the results.}},

Abstract = {{Induction machines are good candidates for traction applications, due to
   their rugged construction and to their use of low-cost readily available
   materials. Traction applications typically require that the
   converter-controlled induction machine be capable of providing both
   motoring torque and braking torque. It is important to distinguish
   between regenerative and non-regenerative braking torque modes; the
   converter-controlled induction machine is a source of electric power in
   the former mode, but it is a sink of electric power in the latter mode.
   Although the existing literature discusses regenerative braking
   operation of induction machines in general terms, no prior work has yet
   identified the location of the boundary that separates the regenerative
   and non-regenerative braking regions of converter-controlled induction
   machines in the torque-speed plane. This paper provides all the analysis
   required to identify this critical operational boundary, and in the
   process reveals a fundamental difference between the regenerative
   braking capability of induction machine drives and permanent-magnet
   synchronous machine drives in the low speed region. The results of this
   paper are relevant to the design of power management systems associated
   with electric and hybrid electric vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Electric and hybrid-electric vehicles are capable of providing
   electrical braking to assist mechanical brakes during a braking event.
   Braking strategies can be formulated to dictate the manner in which the
   braking effort is shared between the electrical and mechanical brakes.
   Electrical braking capability is identified by regions in the braking
   quadrants of an electric machine's torque-speed plane, and these
   capability regions may be further subdivided into regenerative and
   non-regenerative braking regions. Regenerative electrical braking adds
   energy to the energy storage system, whereas non-regenerative electrical
   braking subtracts energy from the energy storage system. This paper uses
   the concept of regenerative braking boundaries to define braking
   strategies that avoid operation in non-regenerative braking regions so
   as to recover as much electrical energy as possible during braking
   events.}},

   solid. We will show that an isotropic distribution of point defects
   cannot be represented by a distribution of purely dilatational
   eigenstrains. However, it can be represented by a distribution of radial
   eigenstrains. We also discuss an analogy between the residual stress

Abstract = {{Divers have to perform technical underwater tasks in dangerous and
   unstructured environments. To reduce a diver's workload and improve
   overall safety, an underwater robotic assistant (UWRA) could be deployed
   with the diver. The UWRA could assist the diver in navigation, quickly
   ferry tools from the surface, and carry underwater samples. To develop
   and test the autonomy required for such a UWRA, autonomy developers
   could benefit from a simulated underwater environment. Unfortunately, a
   real-time simulation for one of the most important sensors in underwater
   robotics, a forward-looking 2D imaging sonar, does not exist in robotics
   simulators. We developed a simulation for 2D imaging sonars that
   executes in real-time in the Gazebo robotics simulator. The 2D imaging
   sonar simulator was assessed by comparing the sonar images that it
   generated with sonar images generated by real sonar systems in similar
   environments. For example, we tested both the simulated and real sonar
   systems in environments with underwater man-made structures, divers, and
   varying terrain. The sonar simulator was also assessed based on its
   computational complexity and compared to other similar simulators with
   respect to sonar image generation rates. We found that our 2D imaging
   sonar simulator generated qualitatively realistic images and that it was
   computationally efficient enough to execute in real-time with the Gazebo
   simulator.}},

Abstract = {{The exploration of under-ice environments has seen increased interest
   over the past few years due to advances in technological capabilities,
   such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), as well as interest in
   exploration of polar regions and Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa.
   Searching for interesting features under the ice, including animals
   capable of sustaining life in such harsh environments, is of great
   interest in both polar (Antarctica) and planetary (Europa) domains.
   Underice environments, such as those encountered beneath the Antarctic
   ice shelves, are largely devoid of such features and tend to be
   monochromatic centered on the blues of the ice. Post-processing of
   under-ice datasets can be very tedious for human analysts. Presented
   here are algorithms to aid in the post-processing of such large and
   mostly featureless datasets. Two novel algorithms are presented here
   which use point-feature detections in video frames to estimate texture
   (number and spread of features) and anomaly locations (dense groupings
   of features). Two additional algorithms are proposed which use hue-based
   methods to estimate the percentage of non-ice pixels present in the
   video frames and to detect anomalous colored pixel groups corresponding
   to candidate anomalies against the background of the ice. These
   algorithms are presented herein along with results from testing with
   both simulated and realworld under-ice video datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Localization and navigation in an under-ice underwater environment
   presents a difficult challenge. GPS, the standard means of localization
   for aerial and terrestrial vehicles, is not available underwater. Common
   underwater navigation solutions such as compass sensors and acoustic
   triangulation are not available under the ice or require overwhelming
   support infrastructure. Decreased localization error in such missions
   would increase the mission capabilities of the underwater vehicle.
   Proposed here is a method for utilizing common camera and sonar sensors
   already onboard many underwater vehicles to bound the error drift rates
   encountered in many navigation systems. A factor graph framework is used
   to synergistically combine relative pose estimates from these two
   independent and complementary sensors. A novel noise model is proposed
   to weight each pose estimate in the overall graph. Optimization of the
   factor graph over all estimates and corresponding weights can be
   performed to obtain a robust estimated vehicle trajectory over the
   entire mission duration. Such a self-contained and robust method can
   help aid in bounding the error rates of an under- ice navigation system.}},

Abstract = {{Effective chemical plume tracing strategies are important for autonomous
   underwater vehicles (AUVs) to perform a variety of missions of searching
   for underwater targets, such as oil spill sources and deep-sea
   hydrothermal vents. In such circumstances where fluid flow direction
   cannot be measured by AUVs or fluid flow direction provides little or
   wrong information about the distribution of a dynamic chemical plume or
   its source location, chemical plume tracing strategies that rely on
   information of fluid flow direction may not work effectively. In this
   paper, a modified moth-inspired chemical plume tracing strategy is
   presented, which could trace a turbulent chemical plume without need of
   information of flow direction. The strategy estimates the direction of
   plume centerline based on information from a pair of spatially separated
   chemical sensors symmetrically mounted on an AUV's nose together with
   the AUV's zigzag plume-tracing trajectory, and employs the estimated
   direction of plume centerline to implement the plume tracing. The
   proposed strategy is implemented in a computer simulation environment
   and the simulation results demonstrate that with the strategy an AUV
   could track a turbulent chemical plume over a long distance and finally
   localize the plume source.}},

Abstract = {{Use-after-free conditions occur when an execution path of a process
   accesses an incorrectly deallocated object. Such access is problematic
   because it may potentially allow for the execution of arbitrary code by
   an adversary. However, while increasingly common, such flaws are rarely
   detected by compilers in even the most obvious instances. In this paper,
   we design and implement a static analysis method for the detection of
   use-after-free conditions in binary code. Our new analysis is similar to
   available expression analysis and traverses all code paths to ensure
   that every object is defined before each use. Failure to achieve this
   property indicates that an object is improperly freed and potentially
   vulnerable to compromise. After discussing the details of our algorithm,
   we implement a tool and run it against a set of enterprise-grade,
   publicly available binaries. We show that our tool can not only catch
   textbook and recently released in-situ examples of this flaw, but that
   it has also identified 127 additional use-after-free conditions in a
   search of 652 compiled binaries in the Windows system32 directory. In so
   doing, we demonstrate not only the power of this approach in combating
   this increasingly common vulnerability, but also the ability to identify
   such problems in software for which the source code is not necessarily
   publicly available.}},

   arises for finding the global node mappings across a batch of corrupted

   its relevant convex optimization algorithms. Our method aims to extract
   the common inliers and their synchronized permutations from disordered
   weighted graphs in the presence of deformation and outliers. Under the
   proposed framework, several variants can be derived in the hope of
   accommodating to specific types of noises. Experimental results

   context-sensitive Hawkes process or cHawkes, which simultaneously infers
   the disease relationship network and models temporal progression of
   patients. Besides learning disease network and temporal progression
   model, cHawkes is able to predict when a specific patient might have
   other related diseases in future given the patient history, which in
   turn can have many potential applications in predictive health
   analytics, public health policy development and customized patient care.
   Extensive experiments on real EHR data demonstrate that cHawkes not only
   can uncover meaningful disease relations and model accurate temporal
   progression of patients, but also has significantly better predictive
   performance compared to several baseline models.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new tensor factorization method, called the Sparse
   Hierarchical-Tucker (Sparse H-Tucker), for sparse and high-order data
   tensors. Sparse H-Tucker is inspired by its namesake, the classical
   Hierarchical Tucker method, which aims to compute a tree-structured
   factorization of an input data set that may be readily interpreted by a
   domain expert. However, Sparse H-Tucker uses a nested sampling technique
   to overcome a key scalability problem in Hierarchical Tucker, which is
   the creation of an unwieldy intermediate dense core tensor; the result
   of our approach is a faster, more space-efficient, and more accurate
   method.
   We test our method on a real healthcare dataset, which is collected from
   30K patients and results in an 18th order sparse data tensor. Unlike
   competing methods, Sparse H-Tucker can analyze the full data set on a
   single multi-threaded machine. It can also do so more accurately and in
   less time than the state-of-the-art: on a 12th order subset of the input
   data, Sparse H-Tucker is 18x more accurate and 7.5x faster than a
   previously state-of-the-art method. Moreover, we observe that Sparse
   HTucker scales nearly linearly in the number of non-zero tensor
   elements. The resulting model also provides an interpretable disease
   hierarchy, which is confirmed by a clinical expert.}},

Abstract = {{Demonstrated is a novel method to the fabrication of microfluidic

   the use of poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) and inkjet-printing
   techniques. PMMA, a low-cost, robust material with low dielectric loss,
   is ideal for sensor fabrication. In addition, inkjet-printing polymer
   (SU-8) as a bonding layer dramatically improves the bonding strength and
   pressure handling. Furthermore, this system integrates two independent
   sensors in the same circuit, enabling concurrent calibration of two
   fluids. Based on the reaction in one sensor, response in another sensor
   for the same fluid can be predicted. The two sensors both have a
   sensitivity over 21\%/log(r) and a good independence in calibrating
   fluids. The sensor system works at microwave frequency, enabling
   applications in wireless sensing including various chemical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A highly-symmetric silicon dioxide shallow shell resonator with
   angstrom-level roughness (R-a=4.3 angstrom) is presented. Curvature
   discontinuities in shallow shells, at a controlled distance from the
   base anchor of the shell, provide acoustic decoupling and significantly
   reduce the anchor contribution to the frequency split in degenerate
   wineglass modes as well as their damping. The Finite Element Method
   (FEM) simulations, performed in COMSOL 4.4, show increasing strain
   energy density at the vicinity of curvature discontinuities, confirming
   acoustic decoupling. The fabricated resonant shells are symmetric
   structures with largely asymmetric supports to force the anchoring stem
   to be the main contributor to the frequency split. Conformal Imaging
   Vibrometer (CIV) measurement characterization indicate that the
   fabricated shallow shell resonators have as-born sub-Hz frequency splits
   (Delta f/f approximate to 60ppm), without any electrical frequency
   tuning, for the lowest elliptical mode shapes, while having asymmetric
   anchoring stems.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc Oxide (ZnO) has emerged as an intriguing material for environmental
   gas sensing. While many applications of ZnO thin films for gas sensing
   have been used, this paper proposes a novel technique in which ZnO thin
   films are patterned to form a lossy frequency selective surface (FSS).
   When the resistance of the ZnO changes with exposure to gas, there is a
   change in the amplitude and resonant frequency of the lossy FSS. A small
   change in the resonant frequency results in approximately 10 dB of
   amplitude shift at the original resonant frequency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for standard cell characterization
   which contains three models: an input capacitance model, a sensitivity
   model for variational resistive-capacitive loads, and gate and
   interconnect delay models via multivariate adaptive regression splines
   (MARS). Our MARS-based methodology has several advantages. Firstly, MARS
   captures nonlinearities and interactions for high-dimensional problems.
   Secondly, MARS is an adaptive and intelligent procedure that can `filter
   out' negligible parameters without manual intervention while
   characterizing a complex cell with over 40 devices. Thirdly, our timing
   methodology has implemented block-based statistical timing analysis
   (StTA) (for path selection) and path-based StTA (for timing accuracy).
   We verified our method by comparing our results to SPICE using ten
   ISCAS85 benchmark circuits. The average errors in the circuit-delay mean
   and standard deviation (SD) are 1.47\% and -1.15\% respectively. We also
   compared our method with traditional quadratic delay models and achieve
   significant accuracy improvement and consume 38\% less run time.}},

Abstract = {{The Hadoop HDFS is a popular open-source distributed storage system,
   which serves as the foundation of many important big-data technologies.
   The performance of data replication is crucial to HDFS, since it
   accounts for a major portion of network traffic in the entire cluster.
   In this research, we propose to enable multicast-based replication,
   which is expected to use less network bandwidth than the native
   TCP-based pipelined replication method. We developed a
   congestion-controlled reliable multicast socket (the CCRMSocket) for
   HDFS and evaluated its performance with our multi-rack test platform.
   The experimental result shows that our multicast implementation can
   effectively save bandwidth and peacefully coexist with TCP traffic. We
   also developed a simulator (the HFlowSim) to further study the impact of
   multicast-based replication to a large-scale Hadoop system. The
   simulation result suggests that multicast-based replication can
   systematically improve a Hadoop system by accelerating the big jobs.}},

   algorithm exploits the relationship between a pixel and its spatial

   detected at the pixel location. Unlike supervised methods that fits
   uncertainty model to available training data, the proposed algorithm is
   based on very simple observation of the eye fixation map, which is
   largely influenced by human visual attention mechanisms. Thus, the
   proposed method is data independent. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is evaluated using the challenging CRCNS video dataset and
   quantified using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). The results
   are promising and could lead to robust uncertainty estimation using
   eye-fixation neighbourhood modeling.}},

   with a variation of threshold power from 11 to 15 dB between 60 and near

Abstract = {{Unquestionably, renewable energy sources (RES) are an indispensable part
   of the future power systems, so-called smart grids. Since these sources
   are of variable and uncertain power output, power system operators would
   come across many challenges in operating future electric power systems.
   Increasing penetration of variable RES specifically wind power
   generation could lead to an increased need in operational flexibility
   within power systems, so that a more flexible power system could
   accommodate a larger amount of variable RES and effectively deal with
   increased variability and uncertainty of the system net load that
   results from the inherent intermittency of RES. Among options available,
   energy storage systems (ESS) could be considered to address this issue.
   In this paper, compressed air energy storage (CAES) is introduced and
   investigated for this purpose. A stochastic programming market-clearing
   model is presented to examine CAES capability for enhancing operational
   flexibility in power systems with high penetration of wind power. In
   order to demonstrate the efficacy of CAES, some case studies are carried
   out in a three-bus test system. The satisfactory results verify CAES
   ability at enhancing power system operational flexibility in terms of
   reduction in wind power curtailment and system operation cost.}},

Abstract = {{Wind generation continues to increase as a source of renewable energy.
   However, adding intermittent renewable energy may lead to overloaded
   lines as well as low voltage buses. Static synchronous compensators
   (STATCOMs) can provide significant reactive power to ensure the voltage
   stability, but overloaded lines may still exist. Therefore, power
   routers, which route power away from overloaded lines to underutilized
   lines, are required. In order to provide the best power-flow control
   with the lowest cost, the power routers should be optimally designed,
   for both their ratings and locations. The coordination between the power
   routers and the STATCOMs should also be taken into consideration. This
   paper introduces a general approach to determine the optimal location
   and sizing of the power routers for a power system with overloaded
   lines, based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.
   Simulation studies on a 12-bus test system verify the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Wind farms are normally located far from the grid and, and may often
   experience islanding or weak grid-connection conditions. In such cases,
   the control system, which traditionally compensates the reactive power
   demanded by the generator, should take over the control of the voltage
   in order to stabilize the load bus voltage. In this paper, a new design
   of a PI-based controller is proposed to effectively maintain the voltage
   output of a wind farm consisting of squirrel-cage induction generators
   (SCIGs) connected to a weak grid, which might also be disconnected. The
   controller output changes the voltage output of a static synchronous
   compensator (STATCOM) to regulate load bus voltage. Conventional
   PI-based control methods are first investigated. Then, a new PI-based
   controller is designed. The results prove that the proposed new control
   method has substantial merits compared to the conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling large-scale fading effects in Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications
   (V2V) in the 5.9GHz Dedicated Short Range Communication band has
   received broad coverage in the literature over the last 15 years. The
   majority of V2V channel measurement campaigns have focused on describing
   the expected path loss of the V2V channel through empirical models. The
   path loss is a channel metric which describes how fast the received
   signal strength decays with distance. It is well known that the path
   loss exponent and reference path loss (y-intercept) varies for different
   environments, but it is not well understood how the channel changes in a
   given environment relative to lane separation or vehicle orientation.
   This paper presents an improved path loss model for line-of-sight (LOS)
   V2V communications at distances less than 100m. The path loss model
   removes the Gaussian random variable component, typically used to model
   shadowing in classic power law path loss model, and instead makes the
   y-intercept and path loss exponent Gaussian random variables. Derived
   from extensive empirical measurement campaigns in which vehicle
   orientation, approach direction, and lane separation are considered, the
   new channel model is compared to experimental data in which the vehicles
   move at different speeds. The improved path loss model performs a better
   fit to experimental data than existing path loss models, including
   two-ray ground reflection, dual-slope piecewise linear, and classic
   power law.}},

Abstract = {{Latencies and delays play an important role in temporally precise robot
   control. During dynamic tasks in particular, a robot has to account for
   inherent delays to reach manipulated objects in time. The different
   types of occurring delays are typically convoluted and thereby hard to
   measure and separate. In this paper, we present a data-driven
   methodology for separating and modelling inherent delays during robot
   control. We show how both actuation and response delays can be modelled
   using modern machine learning methods. The resulting models can be used
   to predict the delays as well as the uncertainty of the prediction.
   Experiments on two widely used robot platforms show significant
   actuation and response delays in standard control loops. Predictive
   models can, therefore, be used to reason about expected delays and
   improve temporal accuracy during control. The approach can easily be
   used on different robot platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel speaker adaptation algorithm for classifying
   speech based on deep neural networks (DNNs). The adaptation algorithm
   consists of two steps. In the first step a deep neural network is
   trained using raw Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features to
   discover hidden structures in the data and employing the activations of
   the last hidden layers of the DNN as acoustic features. In the second
   step using nearest neighbor, an adaptation algorithm learns speaker
   similarity scores based on a small amount of adaptation data from each
   target speaker using the DNN-based acoustic features. Based on the
   speaker similarity score, classification is done using a k-nearest
   neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The novelty of this work is that instead of
   modifying and retraining the DNN for speaker adaptation, which comprises
   a large number of parameters and is computationally expensive,
   activations of the learned DNN are used to project features from MFCC to
   a sparse DNN space; then speaker adaptation is performed based on
   similarity (i.e. nearest neighbor) using k-NN algorithm. With only a
   small amount of adaptation data, it reduces the number of phoneme
   classification error in the TIMIT dataset by 23\%. This work also
   analyzes impact of deep neural networks architecture on speaker
   adaptation performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe an approach to distributed enforcement of
   sticky policies in heterogeneous hardware and software environments.
   These heterogeneous environments might have differing mechanisms for
   attesting to their security capabilities and data sources might specify
   different levels of trust for different data items. Such an environment
   requires highly flexible policy specification and enforcement
   mechanisms. We employ sticky policies that travel with data wherever it
   travels, and we separate them into two components, a hosting policy and
   a usage policy. Hosting policies are used to ensure that data are
   transferred only to entities that are provably capable of providing
   local enforcement and only further transferring data under the same
   policies. Usage policies confer access, viewing, and update capabilities
   on users based on their attributes. The approach is supported by
   attribute-based certificates and policies, which include what
   authorities are trusted to certify attributes. In addition to presenting
   a full description of the approach, we report on a prototype
   implementation that includes all of the aforementioned components and
   also makes use of a modified version of Excel we developed to track
   security labels as data move through spreadsheets that are being shared
   by multiple users across different systems.}},

Abstract = {{Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an emerging memory technology that can
   enable scalable high-density main memory systems. Unfortunately, PCM has
   higher read latency than DRAM, resulting in lower system performance.
   This paper investigates architectural techniques to improve the read
   latency of PCM. We observe that there is a wide distribution in cell
   resistance in both the SET state and the RESET state, and that the read
   latency of PCM is designed conservatively to handle the worst case cell.
   If PCM sensing can be tuned to exploit the variability in cell
   resistance, then we can get reduced read latency. We propose two schemes
   to enable better-than-worst-case read latency for PCM systems.
   Our first proposal, Early Read, reads the data earlier than the
   specified time period. Our key observation that Early Read causes only
   unidirectional errors (SET being read as RESET) allows us to efficiently
   detect data errors using Berger codes. In the uncommon case that Early
   Read causes data error(s), we simply retry the read operation with
   original latency. Our evaluations show that Early Read can reduce the
   read latency by 25\% while incurring a storage overhead of only 10 bits
   per 64 byte line. Our second proposal, Turbo Read, reduces the sensing
   time for read operations by pumping higher current, at the expense of
   accidentally switching the PCM cell with small probability during the
   read operation. We analyze Error Correction Codes (ECC) and
   Probabilistic Row Scrubbing (PRS) for maintaining data integrity under
   Turbo Read. We show that a combination of Early Read and Turbo Read can
   reduce the PCM read latency by 30\%, improve the system performance by
   21\%, and reduce the Energy Delay Product (EDP) by 28\%, while requiring
   minimal changes to the memory system.}},

Abstract = {{Performance scaling is now synonymous with scaling the number of cores.
   One of the consequences of this shift is the increasing difficulty of
   designing processors with predictable and controllable performance. To
   address this challenge this paper proposes a chip-scale throughput
   regulation technique that is based on dynamic tracking of instruction
   execution dynamics in each core. A new variable gain controller design
   is developed for regulating the throughput of modern out-of-order cores.
   The gain is adjusted based on an on-line sensitivity analysis of the
   core's throughput to the control parameter. We explore throughput
   regulation using two control paramaters - core frequency and instruction
   issue width and demonstrate via cycle-level, full system simulation the
   utility of the proposed regulator on both compute and memory intensive
   workloads. Performance results are presented for the application to a 16

   is a principal challenge in systems biology. Mutual information (MI)
   based methods are favored because of their ability to recover non-linear

   this paper, we present the first ever construction of MI based
   genome-scale gene networks using MapReduce. We develop the solution for
   all the stages of a MI-based network construction algorithm using only
   the map and reduce operations on distributed datasets. Our solution is
   implemented using Spark, a software that provides a compute and memory
   abstraction for distributed datasets. We deploy our solution using
   on-demand virtual instances on Amazon EC2 cloud computing platform, thus
   demonstrating the use of a rent-by-the-hour ad-hoc cluster for this
   grand challenge problem in systems biology. Our implementation can scale
   with the number of virtual instances, and can be used to construct
   networks of sizes in the range of 2000 to 5000 genes within an hour in a

Abstract = {{A non-contact TSV fault detection method is proposed using capacitive
   coupled probing. The proposed method detects TSV faults by eye-pattern
   diagrams of extracted EM-modeled transfer characteristics. The TSV and a
   capacitive coupling is modeled using full wave analysis. Because the
   measurement is conducted by moving one top probe without contact
   alignment, it can achieve the fast detection. Moreover, several TSVs can
   be covered at one measurement. From the experimental results, the fault
   existence and no. of faults can be detected with good resolutions.}},

Abstract = {{Automating the interpretation of post-migrated seismic data would
   considerably reduce the time and cost of the interpretation process. In
   this paper, we study the role of texture perception in automating the
   delineation of an important sub-surface structure: salt dome. First, we
   propose a new seismic attribute, the gradient of texture, based on which
   we develop a framework for detecting and delineating salt domes. Since
   the new attribute can be defined based on a variety of dissimilarity
   measures, we define a perceptual dissimilarity measure and compare its
   performance against several other perceptual and non-perceptual texture
   dissimilarity measures in delineating salt domes in a real seismic data
   set. Our experimental evaluation reveals that results based perceptual
   measures are more consistent with human-interpreted results. Therefore,
   an important contribution of this paper is confirming that the human
   interpretation process does not only rely on geological and geophysical
   knowledge, but it also relies on the visual perception of 2D seismic
   data. Further, the proposed perceptual dissimilarity measure yields the
   best result and computational efficiency among all studied measures.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogenous network and massive MIMO can significantly enhance spectral
   and energy efficiency of wireless networks and therefore have attracted
   much attention. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a downlink
   heterogenous network where a macro base station (BS) is equipped with a
   large number of antennas. Lower bounds on ergodic rates for macro and
   pico users are derived when macro and pico BSs employ zero forcing and
   matched filter precoding matrix, respectively. To utilize high degrees
   of freedom introduced by massive MIMO, interference cancellation can be
   used to further improve the network performance. In this way, the macro
   BS can project signals for macro users to the null space of interference
   channels from macro BS to pico users. To maximize the overall network
   transmission rate by selecting the interference-free pico users, an
   algorithm based on statistical channel state information is developed,
   which can reduce the backhaul overhead. The analytical results are
   confirmed and the performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated

Abstract = {{Underwater glider fleets are often used cooperatively for large-scale
   ocean observation. A key requirement for underwater glider operation is
   to reduce the amount of information that needs to be shared among

   estimate the quality of communication link between underwater gliders
   sharing their information. The representation of high flow region that
   gliders should notice is compressed using the support vector data

Abstract = {{This paper studies the simultaneous localization and mapping ( SLAM)
   algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter ( EKF-SLAM) to achieve the
   navigation positioning of underwater gliders in the three-dimensional
   space, as well as to estimate the position of acoustic beacons which are
   used to measure distances as gliders move. The model of SLAM system
   consists of two parts: one part is the glider model, calculating the
   three-dimensional kinematic characteristics of the glider, expanding
   with the current velocity, and the other part is the beacon model, in
   order to reckon the planar coordinates of three acoustic beacons without
   a prior known positions. Based on measurements of distances between the
   glider and beacons, the position of glider and beacons can be estimated
   synchronously, utilizing the EKF method. Since the glider runs more than
   one cycle, the estimation of states in EKF-SLAM system can be optimized,
   combining with measured location of the glider at the sea surface gained
   by the global positioning system ( GPS). The simulation results indicate
   that the EKF-SLAM algorithm for glider positioning is correct and
   effective, which also has high location accuracy.}},

   preference information for individual product features by sentiment
   analysis of online product reviews. The features commented by the users
   of a product are used to augment a simple feature model predefined with
   customer opinionated preference information. In such a way, the customer
   preference information is considered as one attribute of the features in
   the model, helping designers make informed decisions when trading off
   between commonality and variability of a product line. Finally, we

Abstract = {{Power distribution supplies energy directly to customers. However, power
   distribution is particularly vulnerable to severe weather, where large
   scale failures can interrupt electricity service to millions of
   customers for extended durations. Resilience metrics are needed for
   characterizing failures, recoveries and impacts to customers. While
   various resilience measures are studied previously including those from
   the IEEE standards, we find, using real data from Hurricane Sandy, that
   two such commonly-used metrics are inadequate for characterizing
   resilience. We develop a new metric that incorporates randomness and
   dynamics of failures and recoveries from severe weather events. The
   metric is formulated from bottom-up based on a model, i.e., a
   spatiotemporal non-stationary random process. Such a model integrates
   failures and recoveries, and importantly, impacts (costs) to customers.
   The resulting metric consists of a tuple as the infrastructure- and
   service-resilience. The dynamic metric thus characterizes resilience for
   the infrastructure (power distribution), services and customers.
   Large-scale real data from Hurricane Sandy is used to evaluate the
   resilience metric for the operational power grid and the cost on
   customer service interruption.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time radio interferometric positioning system (STRIPS) is a indoor
   localization system with low complexity that is robust to multi path
   effects. Its general idea follows a radio interferometric positioning
   system (RIPS), where two transmitters transmit sinusoidal signals at
   slightly different frequencies to create a slowly-varying envelope at a
   receiver. The receiver employs a cost-efficient envelope detector to
   extract the low-frequency differential signal, of which its phase
   contains a range information. Unlike the original RIPS, however, the
   STRIPS operates in the millimeter-wave (MMW) band, where the signal
   interference and multi path are less prominent than a typical
   radio-frequency (RF) band. In this paper, we implement the STRIPS on
   hardware and experimentally validate its performance. The experimental
   results show that the prototype we have built successfully achieves a
   submeter accuracy on average.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm for finding temporally consistent occlusion
   boundaries in videos to support segmentation of dynamic scenes. We learn
   occlusion boundaries in a pairwise Markov random field (MRF) framework.
   We first estimate the probability of an spatio-temporal edge being an
   occlusion boundary by using appearance, flow, and geometric features.
   Next, we enforce occlusion boundary continuity in a MRF model by
   learning pairwise occlusion probabilities using a random forest. Then,
   we temporally smooth boundaries to remove temporal inconsistencies in
   occlusion boundary estimation. Our proposed framework provides an
   efficient approach for finding temporally consistent occlusion
   boundaries in video by utilizing causality, redundancy in videos, and
   semantic layout of the scene. We have developed a dataset with fully
   annotated ground-truth occlusion boundaries of over 30 videos (similar
   to 5000 frames). This dataset is used to evaluate temporal occlusion
   boundaries and provides a much needed baseline for future studies. We
   perform experiments to demonstrate the role of scene layout, and
   temporal information for occlusion reasoning in dynamic scenes.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, the feasibility of a real-time active matching circuit
   for biomedical WPT applications is discussed. Also, the
   genetic-algorithm based matching circuit design method utilizing
   discrete circuit components is introduced and the practicality of active
   matching circuits for WPT is verified with preliminary measurement
   results featuring a maximum of 3 dB of improvement in transmission
   coefficient for a range of spanning a coil to coil distance of 10 to 12
   cm, which was achieved by inserting the active matching circuit.}},
