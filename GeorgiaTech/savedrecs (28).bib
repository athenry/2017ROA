Abstract = {{The initial stage of the NMR H-1 T-1 relaxation of well-defined
   polypropylene-montmorillonite nanocomposites was investigated at two
   different magnetic fields of 0.54 and 7.05 T. At 0.54 T, two periods can
   be distinguished during the first 30 ms after a saturation pulse train.
   Both periods scale linearly with the square root of the recovery time.
   The first period occurs during the first 1 ms and is attributed to
   direct dipolar relaxation of nuclei in immediate proximity to the clay.
   It is caused by paramagnetic impurities within the clay and is
   characterized by a magnetization recovery curve with a slope
   proportional to the concentration of these impurities. The second period
   occurs at 4 to 30 ms after saturation and is due to spin diffusion
   between the sink, formed by the initial relaxation at the clay surface,
   and the surrounding polymer matrix, which relaxes at a much slower rate.
   The second period is characterized by a magnetization recovery curve
   with a slope proportional to the effective surface area of the clay,
   from which a degree of exfoliation may be determined. At 7.05 T, only a
   single relaxation recovery period is observed. At this higher magnetic
   field, the direct relaxation is characterized by a substantially longer
   relaxation time so that it is not distinguished from the spin-diffusion
   process. As with the slope of the second period of the magnetization
   recovery at 0.54 T, the slope of the magnetization recovery curve at
   7.05 T can be utilized to extract a degree of exfoliation.}},

Abstract = {{P-i-N structure solar cells often provide improved performance over
   N-i-P devices because acceptors are easier to activate when the p-type
   layer is close to the surface. However, for strained InGaN solar cells
   on GaN, the polarization-induced electric field creates a barrier for
   photocurrent that impedes device performance. In this paper we show that
   for Ga-face growth, N-i-P structures can provide improved performance
   because the electric field from the junction is parallel to that formed
   from polarization induced sheet charges. Thus the fields complement each
   other to assist in creating photocurrent in N-i-P devices. Additionally
   we simulate an N-i-P cell using the recently demonstrated insertion of
   ultra-thin GaN interlayers to achieve thick strained layers with high
   material quality.}},

Abstract = {{We report theoretical investigation and optimization of a hot-spot
   cooling method. This hybrid scheme contains a liquid cooling
   microchannel and superlattice hotspot cooler(s). This analysis of the
   hybrid method aims to solve the potential thermal management challenges
   for hotspots especially in 3D stacked multichip packaging. The goal is
   to reduce the overall cooling power and optimize the energy efficiency.
   Starting with a generic modeling of the superlattice cooler system, the
   cooling temperature as a function of the superlattice thickness and the
   driving current is found. The analytic results are then compared with
   full 3D numerical simulation. The role of spreading thermal resistance
   in the chip substrate was found to be important. The later part of this
   report is the integration of the microchannel with the hotspot cooler.
   The pumping power is modeled based on the microchannel design and fluid
   properties. The total cooling power, the sum of the electrical power to
   pump the liquid and the electrical power to drive the superlattice
   cooler, is found as a function of overall heat dissipation of the chip
   including hotspot(s). As the goal is to keep the hottest point on the
   chip below certain threshold (e. g. 85 degrees C), the result shows a
   dramatic reduction of the required total cooling power, when hybrid
   cooling scheme superlattice hotspot cooler in conjunction with
   microchannel cooler - is used. Above particular analysis is based on the
   specific microchannel, but this proposed scheme allows us a systematic
   study to reduce the pump power further.}},

Abstract = {{Data center cooling infrastructure is rapidly evolving along two

   the lowest capital and operating costs, such facilities are undertaking
   a number of steps towards energy usage reductions to improve the power

Abstract = {{Dynamic operation and control is an essential tool for thermal
   management of a number of next generation electronic devices that suffer
   from localized hotspots with large heat fluxes. Due to limited cooling
   resources, the time that high heat flux devices can operate before load
   mitigation approaches must be employed is limited. To mitigate the
   spatial and temporal non-uniformities in chip temperature that result
   from dynamic power maps, the authors have introduced a novel thermal
   management approach that integrates solid-liquid phase change materials
   (PCMs) with an embedded heat spreader network directly into the die near
   the hotspots. This combined PCM-heat spreader network, or Composite
   Thermal Capacitor (CTC), gives the device a large increase in the local
   thermal capacitance near the hotspots. A prototype CTC that
   monolithically integrates micro heaters, PCMs and a Si spreader matrix
   into a test chip has been fabricated and shown to increase allowable
   device operating times by over 650\% and address heat fluxes of up to
   similar to 395 W/cm(2). Coupled to the CTCs are solid state coolers
   (SSCs) that deliver fast regeneration of the CTCs during throttling
   events. Experiments that couple thermoelectric coolers to the CTCs, show
   that system duty cycles of over 50\% can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the configuration for intersecting flows of aircraft.
   Intersections of aircraft flows can be considered as basic building
   blocks for air traffic networks, and traffic networks can be designed
   through finding optimal arrangements of intersections whose conflict
   zones do not overlap. A conflict zone is defined as a minimal circular
   area centered at the intersection of two flows which allows aircraft
   approaching the intersections to resolve conflict completely within the
   conflict zone. This paper derives the relationship between the size of a
   conflict zone and the intersection angle of the two flows. Such a
   relationship guides to find an optimal configuration for intersecting
   aircraft flows. An example involving n converging flows of aircraft
   demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed configuration of
   intersections: the result of conflict resolution shows a greatly reduced
   traffic complexity compared with the solution derived from our previous
   study; the complexity metric is reduced from O(n(4)) to O(n(2)).}},

Abstract = {{We present a new Zero-Copy approach for message passing in a tightly
   coupled, multi-process parallel discrete event simulation. Our approach
   is highly scalable and is suited for large scale distributed
   simulations. A Zero-Copy approach never copies message content. Rather,
   messages are created initially in a shared-memory region, and only a
   smart pointer referring to the shared memory object is passed to a
   message recipient. The smart pointer can be dereferenced normally, and
   has reference count semantics allowing memory reuse when no references
   remain. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data copied
   between processes and results in considerable improvement in overall
   application performance as compared to more traditional shared-memory
   based message passing. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach
   using two distributed discrete event simulators using conservative
   synchronization. However, we also included knowledge of the Global
   Virtual Time and the Current Simulation Time in our memory management
   algorithms, allowing rollbacks and reclaiming of memory that was freed
   prematurely.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss our approach to federating dissimilar discrete event
   simulations, leveraging the strengths and design goals of both, to
   produce a packet-level detailed network model federated with a
   component-level detailed input-queuing router model. All existing
   network simulation tools that we are aware of incorporate a very
   simplistic model for the flow of packets through a router. The
   simplistic model simply responds to a packet receipt event by performing
   a route look-up and adding the packet to the output queue of the
   next-hop output interface. This is often simulated to take place in zero
   time, or with rudimentary probabilistic models of delay within a router.
   However, modern high-end routers are designed using a complex
   input-queuing methodology and a sophisticated scheduling approach to
   move packets through a crossbar switch from the input queue to the
   output queue. We used the popular ns-3 network simulator to create
   realistic packet-level models of network load, and the Manifold computer
   architecture simulator to create a realistic model of data movement
   through an input-queued router. We federated the two by means of two
   alternative approaches: First, two POSIX threads run within a single
   simulation process and utilize the shared memory for both time
   synchronization and packet exchange. Second, we used the well-known MPI
   message passing library for the federation. Our results show that the
   detailed router models can in fact produce somewhat different packet
   delay and loss characteristics than the simplistic router models at the
   expense of considerable computational complexity.}},

   to this drawback, we present Health-Connect system that exploits
   ontology-based model-driven code generation process to provide
   integration among heterogeneous databases and adaptation capability for
   frequent requirements changes. Given an ER model over each
   source-ontology, our tools are able to generate integrated database
   schema, dynamically create mapping between data sources using UMLS,
   translates user queries to access the data sources. In addition, this
   approach provides domain experts a higher level of operation
   abstraction. Our positive experience shows ontology-based model-driven
   code generation is a promising approach for clinical information systems

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an electrothermally actuated, piezoresistively
   detected, silicon-based tuning fork geometry as a suitable platform for
   resonant sensing applications in air. Operated at their fundamental
   tuning fork mode (f(TF) approximate to 400 kHz), in which the two tines
   oscillate with 180 phase shift to each other, the devices exhibit
   Q-factors of 4000-4200 in air. By properly choosing the locations of the
   integrated excitation resistors as well as the four piezoresistors
   forming a Wheatstone bridge, output signals stemming from low-frequency
   out-of-plane vibration modes of the microstructure are successfully
   suppressed. As a result, the tuning forks can be easily embedded into an
   amplifying feedback loop, achieving short-term frequency stabilities in
   air as low as 0.02 ppm (0.008 Hz) for gate times of 1 sec. Coated with a
   chemically sensitive polymer film, the tuning forks were used as
   mass-sensitive sensors with detection limits in the low-ppm range for
   toluene.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents heat transfer (HT) performance of small-scale
   MEMS-enhanced self-powered oscillating actuators for applications in
   highly-compact high-power air-cooled heat exchangers. Commercial
   air-cooled heat sinks are typically much larger than the systems they
   must cool due to large air-side thermal resistance. Our work is applying
   MEMS technologies to reduce this thermal resistance via the integration
   of small-scale oscillating actuators into small heat exchangers.
   Improved HT performance either yields smaller heat sinks or higher heat
   fluxes. These mm-scale actuators were built using MEMS manufacturing
   technologies such as laser micromachining, lamination, and/or metal
   patterning and etching. Conceptually, oscillating reeds inserted into
   the channels of an air-cooled heat sink induce small-scale motions in
   low-Reynolds number flows, which increases HT efficacy. Using
   MEMS-enhanced reed actuators, we experimentally demonstrated local HT
   enhancement up to 250\% in microfabricated channels monitored by
   integrated temperature sensors.}},

   consistent performance over process variations, environmental changes,
   and/or aging effects. An IRR of over 36 dB is obtained in measurement
   for a wide range of IF frequencies. The healing is achieved by means of
   an automated procedure controlled by MATLAB algorithms. The test signal
   source consists of an on-die wideband differential ring oscillator with
   an amplitude-control mechanism to provide a 20 dB range of adjustable
   power at the input of the mixer. The circuits were fabricated in a
   commercially-available 180 nm SiGe BiCMOS platform.}},

Abstract = {{A SiGe V-band voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with varactor-less
   tuning is presented. The frequency tuning of the VCO is accomplished
   using the C-CB capacitance of the core transistors themselves. Removing
   the varactors within the VCO is particularly useful for millimeter-wave
   applications since varactors significantly degrade the quality factor of
   the resonator within the VCO and consequently the phase noise. This VCO
   utilizes a differential cross-coupled topology. The 67 GHz VCO was
   implemented in a commercial 180 nm SiGe BiCMOS platform and achieves a
   6.7\% tuning range and 0.3 dBm differential output power. The VCO
   achieves -90 dBC/Hz phase noise at 1 MHz offset from the 67 GHz signal.}},

   into two tiers. We then explore several alternative design options that
   fully take the advantage of monolithic 3D technology under area and
   reliability goals. Our options include (1) the conventional 2P4N cell
   with new sizing, (2) 3P3N cell with voltage enhancement, (3) 4P4N 8T

Abstract = {{Slepian-Wolf theorem is a well-known framework that targets almost
   lossless compression of (two) data streams with symbol-by-symbol
   correlation between the outputs of (two) distributed sources. However,
   this paper considers a different scenario which does not fit in the
   Slepian-Wolf framework. We consider two identical but spatially
   separated sources. We wish to study the universal compression of a
   sequence of length n from one of the sources provided that the decoder
   has access to (i.e., memorized) a sequence of length m from the other
   source. Such a scenario occurs, for example, in the universal
   compression of data from multiple mirrors of the same server. In this
   setup, the correlation does not arise from symbol-by-symbol dependency
   of two outputs from the two sources. Instead, the sequences are
   correlated through the information that they contain about the unknown
   source parameter. We show that the finite-length nature of the
   compression problem at hand requires considering a notion of almost
   lossless source coding, where coding incurs an error probability p(e)(n)
   that vanishes with sequence length n. We obtain a lower bound on the
   average minimax redundancy of almost lossless codes as a function of the
   sequence length n and the permissible error probability p(e) when the
   decoder has a memory of length m and the encoders do not communicate.
   Our results demonstrate that a strict performance loss is incurred when
   the two encoders do not communicate even when the decoder knows the
   unknown parameter vector (i.e., m -> infinity).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief
   Propagation (BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We
   formulate the recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to
   compute the marginal probability distributions of the variables which
   represent the ratings to be predicted. However, computing these marginal
   probability functions is computationally prohibitive for large-scale
   systems. Therefore, we utilize the BP algorithm to efficiently compute
   these functions. Recommendations for each active user are then
   iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As opposed to the
   previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving the
   recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the
   recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the
   recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without
   requiring a training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K
   MovieLens dataset), we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in
   the predicted ratings of the users until it converges. Finally, we
   confirm that BPRS is comparable to the state of art methods such as
   Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr) and Singular Value
   Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision accuracy.
   Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a
   new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on
   scalability while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications require data processing to be performed on individual
   pieces of data which are of finite sizes, e.g., files in cloud storage
   units and packets in data networks. However, traditional universal
   compression solutions would not perform well over the finite-length
   sequences. Recently, we proposed a framework called memory-assisted
   universal compression that holds a significant promise for reducing the
   amount of redundant data from the finite-length sequences. The proposed
   compression scheme is based on the observation that it is possible to
   learn source statistics (by memorizing previous sequences from the
   source) at some intermediate entities and then leverage the memorized
   context to reduce redundancy of the universal compression of
   finite-length sequences. We first present the fundamental gain of the
   proposed memory-assisted universal source coding over conventional
   universal compression (without memorization) for a single parametric
   source. Then, we extend and investigate the benefits of the
   memory-assisted universal source coding when the data sequences are
   generated by a compound source which is a mixture of parametric sources.
   We further develop a clustering technique within the memory-assisted
   compression framework to better utilize the memory by classifying the
   observed data sequences from a mixture of parametric sources. Finally,
   we demonstrate through computer simulations that the proposed joint
   memorization and clustering technique can achieve up to 6-fold
   improvement over the traditional universal compression technique when a
   mixture of non-binary Markov sources is considered.}},

Abstract = {{The design of biological networks using bacteria as the basic elements
   of the network is initially motivated by a phenomenon called quorum
   sensing. Through quorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the
   medium and communicating it to others via molecular communication. As a
   result, bacteria can orchestrate and act collectively and perform tasks
   impossible otherwise. In this paper, we consider a population of
   bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version of biological
   communication networks, such a node would communicate with one another
   via molecular signals. As a first step toward such networks, this paper
   focuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population
   (i.e., the node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type
   of a molecules signal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes
   inside each bacteria that results in a final output in the form of light
   or fluorescence. Each stage in the process adds noise to the signal
   carried to the next stage. Our objective is to measure (compute) the
   maximum amount of information that we can transfer to the node. This can
   be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node. The molecular
   concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the node,
   which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output
   of the node (i.e., the entire population of bacteria forming the node.
   The molecules are trapped in the bacteria receptors forming complexes
   inside the bacteria which affect the genes responsible for producing the
   light. We focus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping
   molecules at the receptors as well as the variation of outputs of
   different bacteria in the node. The optimal input distribution to
   maximize the mutual information between the output of the node, e.g.,
   light, and the applied molecule concentration is derived. Further, the
   capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the
   number of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated
   the collective sensing capability of the node when a specific form of
   molecular signaling concentration (which resembles M-ary modulation) is
   used. The achievable sensing capacity and the corresponding error
   probabilities were obtained for such practical signaling techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a potential-game theoretical formulation of the
   optimal power flow (OPF) problem with practical operation constraints.
   Each generator operates as an independent player with marginal
   contribution utility function to minimize the generation cost. The
   proposed formulation alleviates the computational burden introduced by
   inequality constraints as they are converted to feasible action sets of
   players. Therefore, both the formulation and solution process of the
   constrained OPF problem are greatly simplified. A learning algorithm
   with guaranteed convergence to Nash equilibrium for potential games,
   called Carnot best response with inertia, is applied to solve the OPF.
   Analytical analysis on how players act as best responses to others is
   provided to investigate the economic reasoning of generator operations.
   As a numerical example, the solutions to a 15-unit system OPF by the
   proposed method are compared with solutions by particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed
   formulation show faster convergence and better result in terms of less
   generation cost.}},

   plurality of the available measurements in a substation, bad data is a

   on which the DSE identifies and removes bad data. Topology changes can
   also be identified and the system model is automatically updated in the

   of the system which can be efficiently stored and utilized offline, thus
   enabling a novel scheme for disturbance recording and playback.

Abstract = {{Computational methods and information systems have been at the center of
   secure and economic planning and operation of electric power systems for
   several decades. Today, transformational forces such as renewable
   energy, distributed resources, energy storage, massive sensing, etc.,
   pose numerous and much more difficult computational challenges. The
   addition of sustainability objectives to the traditional goals of grid
   economy and reliability has resulted in growing uncertainty and
   complexity, and is likely to rend a significant portion of the current
   computational methods and information systems obsolete. The new
   decision-making tools needed in operations and planning must be based on
   computational methods that account for uncertain conditions and are
   capable of handling much more complex problems. On the other hand, the
   availability of massive, more detailed, and new data from PMU, AMI, and
   IED's provides great opportunities for improved grid planning and
   operations, but ways must be found to aggregate, organize, and keep this
   data secure so that it can be leveraged to upgrade, extend, and replace

Abstract = {{System operation reserve requirement keeps going up in the past 3 years
   to compensate for the variation of wind power. This reduces the
   efficiency of thermal units by limiting their energy output.
   Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) as a novel technology was
   proposed to provide up and down regulation reserve due to its fast
   response to charge and discharge. However, given the cost and
   utilization ratio of SMES, an optimal unit commitment (UC) with the
   integration of SMES is necessary. This paper modifies the traditional UC
   model into a chance-constrained stochastic problem to realize the
   optimal schedule objective. To solve this non-convex problem, a
   Branch/Bound (BB) Technique and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
   algorithm is introduced, while the initialization of PSO is achieved by
   the simplex algorithms. Finally, a comparison between the deterministic
   UC and stochastic UC is given. The result indicates the model in this
   paper offers independent system operators (ISO) more freedom to balance
   the system dispatch cost and reliability and it can successfully reduce
   the SMES costs.}},

Abstract = {{High penetration of intermittent renewable energy demands major upgrades
   to the existing power grid transmission infrastructure. Increasing
   transmission capacities and interconnections creates larger balancing
   areas. With a larger balancing area, more grid-connected energy systems
   can be coordinated to achieve one or multiple control objectives (for
   example, balancing intermittent renewable energy), but how to achieve
   such an optimal coordination has not yet been fully answered. The
   existing power system operation method is based on steady-state
   optimization that may break down when fast variation is present in the
   system. To provide a coordinating control solution to multiple
   grid-connected energy systems, an intelligent real-time power flow
   control method, namely the dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF)
   control, is presented in this paper. The DSOPF control algorithm is
   based on the Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDs), which provide methods to
   design optimal neurocontrollers without the need of system analytical
   models. Studies on a 12-bus and a 70-bus test power system are presented

Abstract = {{This presentation will describe field experience in the implementation
   of the distributed state estimator. The distributed state estimator (or
   otherwise named the SuperCalibrator) extracts the dynamic real time
   model of an electric power system using phasor measurement unit (PMU)
   data (GPS-synchronized) and other SCADA data that are available in
   substations. The method utilizes frequency and rate of change of
   frequency data from the PMU as well as the voltage and current phasors.
   Such data are available in raw form, as time-stamped instantaneous
   values, or, in the case of voltages and currents, as computed phasor
   data at the system fundamental frequency. The methodology consists of
   fitting the available PMU and other measurements to the dynamic model of
   the system and therefore it is a dynamic distributed state estimator
   (DSE). Conceptually, the DSE is a filter that uses all available data to
   extract the transient swings of the system in real time.
   The distributed state estimator is in field demonstrations presently.
   One installation has been completed and three others are in progress.
   The involved utilities are USVI-WAPA, NYPA, PG\&E and Southern Company.
   The paper will present the experiences with the field implementation of
   the distributed state estimator, performance data and representative

   optimization procedure is performed which defines the operating
   condition of each wind turbine at the wind farm. The proposed
   infrastructure is enabled by a distributed state estimation procedure
   that evaluates the real time model of the system and the wind farms,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a commentary, computational procedures for design of
   grounding systems using copper or Copperweld (R) ground conductors and
   comparison of these designs. The methodology is based on the IEEE Std
   80. Safety and integrity of the grounding system can be achieved by
   proper selection of ground conductor sizes and installation procedures.
   The paper examines the technical performance of Copperweld (R) ground
   conductor systems and provides a number of example designs. It is
   concluded that the performance of ground systems designed with copper
   conductors or with comparable Copperweld (R) conductors is similar. The
   use of Copperweld (R) conductors, is a viable technical solution with
   the additional benefit of being a good deterrent against theft.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost, self-powered, current and temperature smart wireless sensor
   that can be used in conjunction with several types of utility assets
   including bus-bars, transformers, disconnect switches, cables, and
   conductors promises high value for utilities as they move towards a
   smarter grid. Such sensors will increase asset utilization and
   reliability, and help utilities in making proactive decisions via an
   increased amount of information. This paper extends the concept of
   universal, low-cost, smart, wireless sensors that can be flexibly used
   with many assets. Challenges related to optimal design for the energy
   harvester of the sensor, operation of the sensor under fault conditions,
   and protection of the sensor from lighting strikes, faults, and
   EMI/corona noise have been addressed. Based on extensive simulation and
   experimental study, novel designs for an optimal harvester, a versatile
   protection circuit, and a robust enclosure for the sensor have been
   proposed. Furthermore, a conceptual network architecture that uses such
   sensors in a distributed manner to create a smarter substation has been
   economically justified.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new concept called a Virtual Generator (VG). VGs
   are simplified representations of groups of coherent synchronous
   generators in a power system. They resemble commonly used power system
   dynamic equivalents obtained via generator aggregation techniques.
   Traditionally power system dynamic equivalents are developed offline,
   fixed, and used to replace large portions of the system that are
   considered external to the portion of the system being analyzed in
   detail. In contrast, VGs are calculated online, are not limited to
   representing external areas of the system being analyzed/controlled, and
   do not replace any portion of the power system. Instead, they allow
   wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) to exploit the realization that a
   group of coherent synchronous generators in a power system can be
   controlled as a single generating unit for achieving wide-area damping
   control objectives. The implementation of VGs is made possible by the
   availability of Wide-Area Measurements (WAMs) from Phasor Measurement
   Units (PMUs). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the
   use of power system equivalencing techniques has been extended to
   real-time WADC. Simulation studies carried out on the 68-bus New
   England/New York power system demonstrate that intelligent controllers
   developed using VGs can significantly improve the stability of a power
   system by effectively damping low-frequency interarea oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the effect of dust aerosol on upper tropospheric cirrus
   clouds through heterogeneous ice nucleation is investigated in the
   Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) with two ice nucleation
   parameterizations. Both parameterizations consider homogeneous and
   heterogeneous nucleation and the competition between the two mechanisms
   in cirrus clouds, but differ significantly in the number concentration
   of heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN) from dust. Heterogeneous nucleation on
   dust aerosol reduces the occurrence frequency of homogeneous nucleation
   and thus the ice crystal number concentration in the Northern Hemisphere
   (NH) cirrus clouds compared to simulations with pure homogeneous
   nucleation. Global and annual mean shortwave and longwave cloud forcing
   are reduced by up to 2.0 +/- 0.1 W m(-2) (1 sigma uncertainty) and 2.4
   +/- 0.1 W m(-2), respectively due to the presence of dust IN, with the
   net cloud forcing change of -0.40 +/- 0.20 W m(-2). Comparison of model
   simulations with in situ aircraft data obtained in NH mid-latitudes
   suggests that homogeneous ice nucleation may play an important role in
   the ice nucleation at these regions with temperatures of 205-230 K.
   However, simulations overestimate observed ice crystal number
   concentrations in the tropical tropopause regions with temperatures of
   190-205 K, and overestimate the frequency of occurrence of high ice
   crystal number concentration (> 200 L-1) and underestimate the frequency
   of low ice crystal number concentration (< 30 L-1) at NH mid-latitudes.
   These results highlight the importance of quantifying the number
   concentrations and properties of heterogeneous IN (including dust
   aerosol) in the upper troposphere from the global perspective.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Combining multiple microarray datasets increases sample size and leads
   to improved reproducibility in identification of informative genes and
   subsequent clinical prediction. Although microarrays have increased the
   rate of genomic data collection, sample size is still a major issue when
   identifying informative genetic biomarkers. Because of this, feature
   selection methods often suffer from false discoveries, resulting in
   poorly performing predictive models. We develop a simple
   meta-analysis-based feature selection method that captures the knowledge
   in each individual dataset and combines the results using a simple rank
   average. In a comprehensive study that measures robustness in terms of
   clinical application (i.e., breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer),
   microarray platform heterogeneity, and classifier (i.e., logistic
   regression, diagonal LDA, and linear SVM), we compare the rank average
   meta-analysis method to five other meta-analysis methods. Results
   indicate that rank average meta-analysis consistently performs well
   compared to five other meta-analysis methods.}},

Abstract = {{As systems become more complex and ever more tightly integrated, the
   engineer who must innovate solutions faces an ever-increasing plethora
   of disciplines to understand. The central problem considered in this
   paper is how to prepare learners to innovate in such an environment. The
   context is set in a School of Aerospace Engineering with a large student
   throughput. The guiding philosophy behind this paper is that the breadth
   across disciplines, needed for such innovation must be accompanied by
   uncompromising depth of understanding. Three years of progress are
   summarized on EXTROVERT, a project designed to build and use resources
   that help aerospace engineers learn to innovate across disciplines.
   Experience from several courses and projects is summarized on how
   engineering student learn using different resources. The approach of
   this effort is to enable learners to gain confidence in solving
   problems, using with their own preferences in determining the learning
   sequence. Concepts implemented include a portal to aerospace engineering
   centered on conceptual design of flight vehicles, vertical streams of
   in-depth technical content, engineering case studies of historically
   significant vehicle systems, a library of solved problems, integrative
   concept essays, and a module-based assessment approach to measure
   learning in near real time to provide feedback and modification during
   the learning process. Assessment has been conducted across a spectrum of
   courses. Compact e-books have been developed for several subjects
   including advanced concept development projects. The EXTROVERT resources
   have been exploited in courses ranging from a freshman engineering
   introductory course to upperclass and graduate courses. An inspiring
   metric is in the quantum jump in the capabilities of most of the
   students, and their very thoughtful reflections on what they have
   gained. These new capabilities are significant enough to warrant a
   reconsideration of traditional course structure, in order to facilitate
   much more student participation and iteration.}},

Abstract = {{Research on ocean reverberation has practical and scientific
   significance. Much progress has been made in the past three decades to
   improve our understanding of reverberation. However, there remain
   important unanswered questions and a real scarcity of high-quality basic
   research data sets. New progress on the reverberation modeling and the
   low-frequency (LF) seabed scattering characterization in shallow water
   (SW) requires three essential conditions: 1). A reliable reverberation
   model using a physics-based seabed scattering function, 2). Carefully
   calibrated broadband reverberation data, and 3). A ground truth about
   the seabed geoacoustic model. Some related work on these topics is
   introduced in this paper. The energy flux method for SW reverberation is
   briefly introduced. Integration of this method with physics-based seabed
   scattering models directly and intuitively results in a general
   expression for SW reverberation. A simple relationship between the
   classic scattering cross-section and the modal scattering matrix is
   derived. Some basic research data sets, including the reverberation
   level/vertical coherence as a function of time, frequency,
   depth/hydrophone separation and sea state, are reported. Reverberation
   data and model predictions are in good agreement, which results in some
   inversion results. The HF seabed scattering models and the energy flux
   method-derived reverberation model are validated using LF reverberation

Abstract = {{Marine animals use sound for communication, navigation, predator
   avoidance, and prey detection. Thus the rise in acoustic energy
   associated with increasing human activity in the ocean has potential to
   impact the lives of marine animals. Thirty years ago marine bioacoustics
   primarily focused on evaluating effects of human-generated sound on
   hearing and behavior by testing captive animals and visually observing
   wild animals. Since that time rapidly changing electronic and computing
   technologies have yielded three tools that revolutionized how
   bioacousticians study marine animals. These tools are (1) portable
   systems for measuring electrophysiological auditory evoked potentials,
   (2) miniaturized tags equipped with positioning sensors and acoustic
   recording devices for continuous short-term acoustical observation
   rather than intermittent visual observation, and (3) passive acoustic
   monitoring (PAM) systems for remote long-term acoustic observations at
   specific locations. The beauty of these breakthroughs is their direct
   applicability to wild animals in natural habitats rather than only to
   animals held in captivity. Hearing capabilities of many wild species
   including polar bears, beaked whales, and reef fishes have now been
   assessed by measuring their auditory evoked potentials. Miniaturized
   acoustic tags temporarily attached to an animal to record its movements
   and acoustic environment have revealed the acoustic foraging behavior of
   sperm and beaked whales. Now tags are being adapted to fishes in effort
   to understand their behavior in the presence of noise. Moving and static
   PAM systems automatically detect and characterize biological and
   physical features of an ocean area without adding any acoustic energy to
   the environment. PAM is becoming a powerful technique for understanding
   and managing marine habitats. This paper will review the influence of
   these transformative tools on the knowledge base of marine bioacoustics
   and elucidation of relationships between marine animals and their
   acoustic environment, leading to a new, rapidly growing field of marine
   acoustic ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The salient features of mixed-phase and ice clouds in a GCM cloud scheme
   are examined using the ice nucleation parameterizations of Liu and
   Penner (LP) and Barahona and Nenes (BN). The performance of both
   parameterizations was assessed in the GEOS-5 AGCM using the McRAS-AC
   cloud microphysics framework in single column mode. Four dimensional
   assimilated data from the intensive observation period of ARM TWP-ICE
   campaign was used to drive the fluxes and lateral forcing. Simulation
   experiments were established to test the impact of each parameterization
   in the resulting cloud fields. Three commonly used IN spectra were
   utilized in the BN parameterization to describe the availability of IN
   for heterogeneous ice nucleation. The results showed large similarities
   in the cirrus cloud regime between all the schemes tested, in which ice
   crystal concentrations were within a factor of 10 regardless of the
   parameterization used. In mixed-phase clouds there were some persistent
   differences in cloud particle number concentration and size, as well as
   in cloud fraction, ice water mixing ratio, and ice water path. Contact
   freezing in the simulated mixed-phase clouds contributed to the
   effective transfer of liquid to ice, so that on average, the clouds were
   fully glaciated at T similar to 260 K, irrespective of the ice
   nucleation parameterization used. Comparison of simulated ice water path
   to available satellite derived observations were also performed, finding
   that all the schemes tested with the BN parameterization predicted
   average values of IWP within +/-15\% of the observations.}},

Abstract = {{Elastomeric materials require the incorporation of reinforcing fillers
   in order to improve their mechanical properties. The enhancement of
   properties is very much dependent on the size and any surface
   modification of the reinforcing agent. It is widely accepted that the
   reinforcement effects are primarily due to molecular interactions of the
   polymeric matrix and the filler inclusions and it involves both chemical
   and physical interactions. Herein, we have incorporated silica nano
   fillers (Stober silica) into poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomeric
   networks. The mechanical and swelling properties of the networks were
   investigated as a function of filler sizes (50, 130, and 170 nm), volume
   fraction of the filler inclusions, and surface treatment of the
   particles by were analyzed to give the Mooney-Rivlin constants 2C(1) and
   2C(2). These properties were found to be dependent on the size of the
   nano inclusions. Thus, a nano size phenomenon had been discerned and was
   one of the highlights of this investigation. This phenomenon was largely
   attributed to the high specific surface area of the nano fillers used
   that leads to significant increase in the interfacial interactions.
   Also, and as would be expected, the properties of the polymeric networks
   filled with unmodified particles were different than those obtained for
   the polymeric networks filled with surface-modified particles. This has
   been primarily attributed to changes in the surface properties, and as
   would be expected, the elastic properties of the networks were thus
   shown to be strongly dependent on type and concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Given a directed graph G = (V, E) and an integer k >= 1, a
   k-transitive-closure-spanner (k-TC-spanner) of G is a directed graph H =
   (V, EH) that has (1) the same transitive-closure as G and (2) diameter
   at most k. These spanners were implicitly studied in the context of
   circuit complexity, data structures, property testing, and access
   control, and properties of these spanners have been rediscovered over
   the span of 20 years. We abstract the common task implicitly tackled in
   these diverse applications as the problem of constructing sparse
   TC-spanners. We initiate the study of approximability of the size of the
   sparsest k-TC-spanner of a given directed graph. We completely resolve
   the approximability of 2-TC-spanners, showing that it is Theta(log n)
   unless P = NP. For k > 2, we present a polynomial time algorithm that
   finds a k-TC-spanner with size within O((n log n)(1-1/k)) of the
   optimum. Our techniques also yield algorithms with the first nontrivial
   approximation ratio for well-studied problems on directed spanners when
   k > 3: Directed k-SPANNER, CLIENT/SERVER DIRECTED k-SPANNER, and
   k-DIAMETER SPANNING SUBGRAPH. For constant k >= 3, we show that the size
   of the sparsest k-TC-spanner is hard to approximate within a factor of
   2log(1-epsilon) n for any epsilon is an element of (0, 1) unless NP
   subset of DTIME(n(polylog n)). Finally, we study the size of the
   sparsest k-TC-spanners for H-minor-free graph families. Combining our
   constructions with our insight that 2-TC-spanners can be used for
   designing property testers, we obtain a monotonicity tester with
   O(log(2) n/epsilon) queries for any poset whose transitive reduction,
   when viewed as an undirected graph, is free of a fixed minor.
   Previously, the best upper bound on the query complexity for such graphs
   was O(root n/epsilon).}},

Abstract = {{This paper applies a general computational technique for optimal control
   of switched-mode hybrid systems, recently developed by the authors, to
   voltage-regulation problems in a step-down DC-DC converter. Unlike
   existing techniques that are based on model-predictive control and a
   specific algebraic structure of the problem, the algorithms presented
   here are based on gradient descent with Armijo step size, and
   consequently can incorporate time-dependent state constraints in a
   natural way. The approach proposed in this paper is complementary to the
   extant MPC-based techniques, and it appears to compare favorably with
   some of the established works. Two problems are being addressed: one
   concerns pulse-width modulation and computes the optimal duty ratio, and
   the other computes an optimal switching schedule without a fixed cycle
   time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop dissipativity notions for dynamical systems
   with discontinuous vector fields. Specifically, we consider dynamical
   systems with Lebesgue measurable and locally essentially bounded vector
   fields characterized by differential inclusions involving Filippov
   set-valued maps specifying a set of directions for the system velocity
   and admitting Filippov solutions with absolutely continuous curves. In
   particular, we introduce a generalized definition of dissipativity for
   discontinuous dynamical systems in terms of set-valued supply rate maps
   and set-valued storage maps consisting of locally Lebesgue integrable
   supply rates and Lipschitz continuous storage functions, respectively.
   In addition, we introduce the notion of a set-valued available storage
   map and a set-valued required supply map, and show that if these maps
   have closed convex images they specialize to single-valued maps
   corresponding to the smallest available storage and the largest required
   supply of the differential inclusion, respectively. Furthermore, we show
   that all system storage functions are bounded from above by the largest
   required supply and bounded from below by the smallest available
   storage, and hence, a dissipative differential inclusion can deliver to
   its surroundings only a fraction of its generalized stored energy and
   can store only a fraction of the generalized work done to it.}},

Abstract = {{Airdrop systems provide a unique capability of delivering large payloads
   to undeveloped and inaccessible locations. Guided airdrop systems based
   on steerable, ram-air parafoils have been developed with the goal of
   improving the precision and accuracy of air-dropped payload delivery. In
   practice, the gliding ability of the ram-air canopies can actually
   create major problems for airdrop systems by making them more
   susceptible to winds and allowing them to achieve far greater miss
   distances than were previously possible. Research and development work
   on guided airdrop systems has focused primarily on improving the
   guidance algorithm. By comparison, the navigation and control algorithms
   have changed little since the initial guided systems were developed.
   Furthermore, the control mechanisms have not changed since the invention
   of the ram-air canopy in the 1960's. This work seeks an improvement in
   landing accuracy over current state of the art airdrop systems through
   the incorporation of advanced control algorithms and novel control
   mechanisms. The key concepts utilized are system identification in
   real-time during each flight and glide slope control through in-flight
   incidence angle variation coupled with symmetric trailing edge brake
   deflection. Simulation and flight test results demonstrate a factor of
   two improvement in landing accuracy with the use of glide slope control.
   Simulation results also demonstrate that the adaptation of internal
   models with in-flight system identification can dramatically improve
   landing accuracy in situations where there is significant uncertainty in
   the system flight characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the manual control of mechanical systems with
   oscillatory dynamics, and the effects of adding input shaping to
   suppress command-induced vibration. Behavior of the system is analyzed
   using concepts from manual control theory. A series of operator
   experiments tested tracking behavior using elements with a low-frequency
   (1.25 rad/s) and a high-frequency (5 rad/s) oscillatory mode. After each
   experimental trial, measures of subjective task difficulty and tracking
   performance were recorded, and frequency-domain control characteristics
   were computed. Results showed that the higher-frequency oscillatory mode
   did not significantly decrease tracking performance from the
   non-oscillatory case, so input shaping did not cause a significant
   improvement in tracking performance. However, input shaping did cause a
   decrease in average subjective task difficulty, and made the system
   closely resemble McRuer's ``crossover model.{''} For the lower-frequency
   case, the addition of input shaping significantly improved the tracking
   performance and reduced the tracking difficulty. These results
   demonstrate that input shaping can greatly improve the continuous
   tracking ability of a human-machine system in the presence of
   oscillatory modes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an approach to motion sequencing and
   generation in which ``style of motion{''} is taken into account in a
   systematic manner. In particular, we present a method for injecting
   so-called dynamic efforts into a discrete motion sequencing framework
   that utilizes existing theory of stylistic human movement to inform a
   principled approach to generating trajectories. Namely, choosing weights
   in a linear-quadratic cost function leads to trajectories corresponding
   to the eight basic effort qualities found in dance theory; each weight
   scales a different motion factor that describes an element of style
   perceived by an audience. Combined with a style-sensitive motion
   sequencing scheme, we can fully describe stylistic system behavior.
   Thus, this paper also reports on the application of this general
   framework to the problem of generating motion sequences for a humanoid
   robot that exhibit distinctly different stylistic behaviors though they
   are composed from the same underlying building blocks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an online controller for tracking power-budgets in
   multicore processors using dynamic voltage-frequency scaling. The
   proposed control law comprises an integral controller whose gain is
   adjusted online based on the derivative of the power-frequency
   relationship. The control law is designed to achieve rapid settling
   time, and it's tracking property is formally proven. Importantly, the
   controller design does not require off-line analysis of application
   workloads making it feasible for emerging heterogeneous and asymmetric
   multicore processors. Simulation results are presented for controlling
   power dissipation in multiple cores of an asymmetric multicore
   processor. Each core is i) equipped with the controller, ii) assigned a
   power budget, and iii) operates independently in tracking to its power
   budget. We use a cycle-level multicore simulator driven by traces from
   SPEC2006 benchmarks demonstrating that the proposed algorithm achieves a
   faster settling time than examples of a static setting of the controller
   gain.}},

Abstract = {{In search of next-generation solar cells, silicon nanowire arrays have
   attracted great attention since they are cost-effective and may absorb
   more light compared to thin-film silicon solar cells. Theoretical
   studies using finite-different time-domain and transfer matrix methods
   have been performed to investigate the optical properties of silicon
   nanowire (SiNW) arrays, however, they are computationally intensive and
   require periodic condition, which may not be satisfied with most
   fabricated samples. In the present study, an effective medium analysis
   is performed to study the optical properties of vertically-aligned SiNWs
   on Si substrate in the wavelength range from 310 nm to 1100 nm, which is
   of the most important interest for solar cells. The effective dielectric
   function of the SiNW layer is obtained from the Bruggeman approximation.
   Thin-film optics formulae are employed to calculate the reflectance,
   transmittance and absorptance of the SiNWs on silicon substrate at
   normal incidence. The effect of geometric parameters such as filling
   ratio and wire length will be investigated to understand the light
   absorption and to facilitate the optimal design of high-performance SiNW
   solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Waspaloy is a polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy used in disc rotors
   for gas turbine engines. Waspaloy, like other superalloys, is
   strengthened through the formation of the gamma' precipitate phase. As
   this precipitate phase evolves with processing and thermal exposure, it
   is desirable to non-destructively monitor the precipitate
   microstructural evolution. Electrical resistivity was used as such a
   non-destructive monitoring technique for aging temperatures ranging from
   600 degrees C to 800 degrees C and aging times ranging between 2min and
   263.5h. In the nucleation regime, a Johnson-Mehl-Avrami type equation
   was fit to the electrical response. For the growth and coarsening
   regimes, a volume distribution of precipitates was fit to the measured
   electrical resistivity. These fitting techniques were facilitated by
   microstnictural data obtained from SEM imaging, X-ray diffraction, and
   small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. For both cases, the
   models showed an excellent fit to the measured electrical data, implying
   that electrical resistivity is a viable technique for non-destructively
   monitoring the precipitate phase in Waspaloy.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware support for Global Address Spaces (GAS) has previously focused
   on providing efficient access across remote memories, typically using
   custom interconnects or high-level software layers. New technologies,
   such as Extoll, HyperShare, and NumaConnect now allow for cheaper ways
   to build GAS support into the data center, thus making high-performance
   coherent and non-coherent remote memory access available for standard
   data center applications.
   At the same time, data center designers are currently experimenting with
   a greater use of accelerators like GPUs to enhance traditionally
   CPU-oriented processes, such as data warehousing queries for in-core
   databases. However, there are very few workable approaches for these
   accelerator clusters that both use commodity interconnects and also
   support simple multi-node programming models, such as GAS.
   We propose a new commodity-based approach for supporting non-coherent
   GAS in accelerator clouds using the HyperTransport Consortium's
   HyperTransport over Ethernet (HToE) specification. This work details a
   system model for using HToE for accelerated data warehousing
   applications and investigates potential bottlenecks and design
   optimizations for an HToE network adapter, or HyperTransport Ethernet
   Adapter (HTEA).
   Using a detailed network simulator model and timing measured for queries
   run on high-end GPUs {[}34], we find that the addition of wider
   deencapsulation pipelines and the use of bulk acknowledgments in the
   HTEA can improve overall throughput and reduce latency for multiple
   senders using a common accelerator. Furthermore, we show that the
   bandwidth of one receiving HTEA can vary from 2.8 Gbps to 24.45 Gbps,
   depending on the optimizations used, and the inter-HTEA latency for one
   packet is 1,480 ns. A brief analysis of the path from remote memory to
   accelerators also demonstrates that the bandwidth of today's GPUs can
   easily handle a stream-based computation model using HToE.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{10925-10936}},
Abstract = {{In this study, Populus trichocarpa was subjected to dilute acid
   pretreatment at varying pretreatment times. The three major components
   of lignocellulosic biomass, namely cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin,
   were isolated from the starting and dilute acid pretreated poplar. Gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   techniques were utilized to elucidate structural transformations of
   poplar during dilute acid pretreatment. The results demonstrated that
   the pretreatment dissolved hemicelluloses and disrupted structural
   features of lignin and polysaccharides. As revealed by NMR, the
   aryl-O-ether linkage (beta-O-4) of lignin was extensively cleaved and
   lignin repolymerization occurred during pretreatment. The lignin was
   also observed to have a decrease in S/G ratio and methoxyl group content
   and these changes were accompanied with an increase in condensed lignin.
   The dilute acid pretreatment resulted in a reduction in molecular weight
   of cellulose and hemicellulose, while no prominent change of molecular
   weight was observed for lignin. The polydispersity index of cellulose
   appeared to increase initially within a short time of pretreatment
   (0.3-1 min) and start to decrease with longer pretreatment time during
   the bulk phase of chain scission (5.4-26.8 min). The DA pretreatment
   demonstrated no significant impact on the crystalline index (CrI) of
   cellulose particularly within the short time range of pretreatments
   examined in this study, with CrI remaining almost unchanged during the
   pretreatment time of 0.3-5.4 min and a slight increase observed as the
   pretreatment time extended to 8.5 and 26.8 min.}},

   reconstructive mandible, the maximum deformation occurred near the
   mandible midline. There was little deformation at bilateral mandible
   ramus posterior. As the loading on the reconstructive mandible
   increasing, the maximum deformation near the mandible midline was
   increasing. According to the customized titanium plate virtual design
   and deformation simulation analysis of human lateral mandible defect
   before operation, the simulation could predict the mandible maximum
   deformation position after the surgery. The doctors could improve the

Abstract = {{Screen printed low to medium concentrator silicon solar cells have
   potential to drive down the cost of PV since it replaces expensive
   semiconductor material by less expensive optics while maintaining high
   efficiency. However, the conventional screen-printed finger width is
   generally >= 100 mu m which limits the efficiency under higher
   concentration. In this paper, we report on the application of 50 mu m
   wide fingers fabricated by nScrypt non-contact direct printing
   technology to resolve this problem. Two approaches were used to evaluate
   the merit of fine line extrusion printed fingers relative to normal
   screen-printed fingers. First approach involves keeping the metal
   coverage the same by increasing the number of lines, from 50 to 100,
   which lowers the series-resistance (Rs) and increases the FF. Second
   strategy involves keeping the Rs same by decreasing the number of lines,
   from 100 to 69, or reducing metal coverage which leads to higher Jsc. In
   this study, conventional screen-printed concentrator cells gave a peak
   efficiency of 19.2\% at similar to 7 suns and 18.5\% at 20 suns. The
   first strategy raised the peak efficiency to 19.7-20.0\% in the range of
   5 to 20 suns. The second approach to reducing metal coverage which
   keeping the same Rs raised the peak efficiency to 20.3\% at similar to 7
   suns which decreased gradually to 19.2\% at 20 suns. Thus the use of 50
   mu m wide lines can give 0.5 to 1.3\% absolute efficiency enhancement in
   the range of 1-20 suns. These are among the most efficient metal paste
   printed low to medium concentrator solar silicon cells.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate a simple and improved absorption geometry
   using micro-hole architecture for micro concentrating photovoltaic
   (MCPV). Each micro concentrator is coupled with a very small C-Si solar
   cell. The incident light is concentrated by micro concentrator on the
   coupled small area thick film photovoltaic (PV). The PV is designed
   using proposed micro-hole based architecture to facilitate maximum
   absorption of the concentrated incident light into the device. Our
   analysis found that the absorptance of the coupled C-Si solar cell is
   over 71\% and the ultimate efficiency of the coupled solar cell is 35\%
   using proposed micro-hole based architecture. Additionally, the
   reflected light from the C-Si surface is being trapped by the multimode
   wave guide and the full MCPV device ultimate efficiency can be improved
   over 42\% in the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture strength variation across the surface of multi-crystalline
   silicon (mc-Si) wafers cut by multi-wire slurry sawing (MWSS) was
   studied in this paper. As-sawn 156x156mm(2) mc-Si wafers were diced in
   two orthogonal orientations relative to the wire speed direction to
   yield small rectangular samples whose fracture strength was measured
   using the four line bending method. It is shown that the fracture
   strength of the wafer increases gradually from wire entry to wire exit
   along the wire speed direction whereas the variation in strength in the
   wire feed direction is small. Wafer samples bent in the orientation
   perpendicular to the wire speed direction show a slightly higher
   fracture strength than those bent parallel to the wire speed direction.
   Wafer samples from an interior and a corner brick show similar fracture
   strength variation. The results also reveal the critical role of
   abrasive-induced surface damage and the associated fracture strength of
   the silicon wafers.}},

   installed system cost (BOS+Module), loan rate, and total system derate
   losses. LCOE was found to be a non-linear function of system lifetime
   and module efficiency. User friendly charts were generated along with
   empirical equations to establish quantitative relationship between LCOE
   and system and financial parameters. A road map to grid parity at 9c/kWh
   was developed to illustrate how to use the methodology, charts, and

Abstract = {{Blended heterojunctions continue to improve in overall efficiency, with
   current power conversion efficiencies (PCE) at >7\%, with interfaces
   being a dominating factor in improving PCE. Charge separation is
   dictated by energetic alignment between the donor and acceptor.
   Selective interlayers are used to preferentially harvest one charge via
   either thermodynamic or kinetic pathways. Energetic level alignment
   between the blend and the charge collection interfaces can impact the
   open circuit voltage (V-OC) through both loss mechanisms and poor choice
   of interlayers can result in less than ideal charge collection
   efficiencies. Here we report on the surface work function
   characterization of interlayers and phosphonic acid modifiers using
   ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and the measured energetic level
   alignment between the interlayers and PCDTBT: PC70BM BHJs. We will

Abstract = {{Bimetallic nanocrystals consisting of two distinct metals such as Pd and
   Pt are attractive for a wide variety of catalytic and electrocatalytic
   applications as they can exhibit not only a combination of the
   properties associated with both metals but also enhancement or synergy
   due to a strong coupling between the two metals. With Pd as the base
   metal, many methods have recently been demonstrated for the synthesis of
   Pd-Pt bimetallic nanocrystals having a wide variety of different
   structures in the form of alloys, dendrites, core-shells, multi-shells,
   and monolayers. In this tutorial review, we begin with a brief
   discussion on the possible structures of Pd-Pt bimetallic nanocrystals,
   followed by an account of recent progress on synthetic approaches to
   such nanocrystals with controlled structures, shapes and sizes. In
   addition to the experimental procedures and mechanistic studies, a
   number of examples are presented to highlight the use of such bimetallic
   nanocrystals as catalysts or electrocatalysts for various applications
   with enhanced performance relative to their monometallic counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Silylamine reversible ionic liquids were designed to achieve specific
   physical properties in order to address effective CO2 capture. The
   reversible ionic liquid systems reported herein represent a class of
   switchable solvents where a relatively non-polar silylamine (molecular
   liquid) is reversibly transformed to a reversible ionic liquid (RevIL)
   by reaction with CO2 (chemisorption). The RevILs can further capture
   additional CO2 through physical absorption (physisorption). The effects
   of changes in structure on (1) the CO2 capture capacity (chemisorption
   and physisorption), (2) the viscosity of the solvent systems at partial
   and total conversion to the ionic liquid state, (3) the energy required
   for reversing the CO2 capture process, and (4) the ability to recycle
   the solvents systems are reported.}},

   differentiation}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1459-1469}},
Abstract = {{Patient-to-patient variability in disease progression continues to
   complicate clinical decisions of treatment regimens for cardiovascular
   diseases, metastatic cancers and osteoporosis. Here, we investigated if
   monocytes, circulating white blood cells that enter tissues and
   contribute to disease progression by differentiating into macrophages or
   osteoclasts, could be useful in understanding this variability.
   Monocyte-derived macrophages and osteoclasts produce cysteine
   cathepsins, powerful extracellular matrix proteases which have been
   mechanistically linked to accelerated atherosclerotic, osteoporotic, and
   tumor progression. We hypothesized that multivariate analysis of
   temporal kinase activation states during monocyte differentiation could
   predict cathepsin proteolytic responses of monocyte-derived macrophages
   and osteoclasts in a patient-specific manner. Freshly isolated primary
   monocytes were differentiated with M-CSF or RANKL into macrophages or
   osteoclasts, respectively, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, p38 MAPK,
   JNK, c-jun, and I kappa B-alpha were measured at days 1, 3, 6, and 9. In
   parallel, cell diameters and numbers of nuclei were measured, and
   multiplex cathepsin zymography was used to quantify cathepsins K, L, S,
   and V activity from cell extracts and conditioned media. There was
   extensive patient-to-patient variability in temporal kinase activation
   states, cell morphologies, and cathepsin K, L, S, and V proteolytic
   activity. Partial least squares regression models trained with temporal
   kinase activation states successfully predicted patient-specific
   morphological characteristics (mean cell diameter and number of nuclei)
   and patient-specific cathepsin proteolytic activity with predictability
   as high as 95\%, even with the challenge of incorporating the complex,
   unknown cues from individual patients' unique genetic and biochemical
   backgrounds. This personalized medicine approach considers patient
   variability in kinase signals to predict cathepsin activity. Such
   analyses may provide beneficial tools for personalized kinase and
   protease inhibitor therapies for tissue destructive diseases.}},

Title = {{Feasibility of Output-Only Modal Identification Using Wireless Sensor
   Network: A Quantitative Field Experimental Study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Although significant advancements have been achieved in wireless sensor
   network (WSN) in the past decades, there is still a strong need for
   in-depth analysis on wireless time synchronization and data quality
   during field testing. In this paper, an academic WSN is adopted for
   output-only modal identification of two full-scale bridges in Xiamen,
   China. This paper first assesses the accuracy of time synchronization
   performed by the WSN through a centralized beacon signal and then
   studies wireless data quality using two quantitative performance
   indexes. The relationship between vibration amplitude and quality of
   wireless sensor data is investigated. With ambient bridge accelerations
   acquired by wireless sensing units, modal properties of the two bridges
   are identified using the stochastic subspace identification (SSI) method
   and the enhanced frequency domain decomposition (EFDD) method.
   Accuracies of the modal identification results are evaluated through
   comparison with modal properties identified from tethered sensing data.
   The comparison shows close match in natural frequencies and mode shapes,
   although relatively large difference in damping ratios exists between
   results from wireless and tethered sensing data. An overall close match
   between the wireless and tethered results demonstrates the feasibility
   of using WSN for the ambient vibration testing of full-scale bridges.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two methods used in 3D IC placement that
   effectively exploit the die-to-die thermal coupling in the stack. First,
   TSVs are spread on each die to reduce the local power density and
   vertically aligned across dies simultaneously to increase thermal
   conductivity to the heatsink. Second, we move high-power logic cells to
   the location that has higher conductivity to the heatsink while moving
   TSVs in the upper dies so that high-power cells are vertically
   overlapping below the TSVs. These methods are employed in a
   force-directed 3D placement successfully and outperform several
   state-of-the-art placers published in recent literature.}},

   Asian dust storm episode}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Community Multiscale Air
   Quality (CMAQ) modeling system version 4.7 is further developed to
   enhance its capability in simulating the photochemical cycles in the
   presence of dust particles. The new model treatments implemented in CMAQ
   v4.7 in this work include two online dust emission schemes (i.e., the
   Zender and Westphal schemes), nine dust-related heterogeneous reactions,
   an updated aerosol inorganic thermodynamic module ISORROPIA II with an
   explicit treatment of crustal species, and the interface between
   ISORROPIA II and the new dust treatments. The resulting improved CMAQ
   (referred to as CMAQ-Dust), offline-coupled with the Weather Research
   and Forecast model (WRF), is applied to the April 2001 dust storm
   episode over the trans-Pacific domain to examine the impact of new model
   treatments and understand associated uncertainties. WRF/CMAQ-Dust
   produces reasonable spatial distribution of dust emissions and captures
   the dust outbreak events, with the total dust emissions of similar to
   111 and 223 Tg when using the Zender scheme with an erodible fraction of
   0.5 and 1.0, respectively. The model system can reproduce well observed
   meteorological and chemical concentrations, with significant
   improvements for suspended particulate matter (PM), PM with aerodynamic
   diameter of 10 mu m, and aerosol optical depth than the default CMAQ
   v4.7. The sensitivity studies show that the inclusion of crustal species
   reduces the concentration of PM with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m
   (PM2.5) over polluted areas. The heterogeneous chemistry occurring on
   dust particles acts as a sink for some species (e. g., as a lower limit
   estimate, reducing O-3 by up to 3.8 ppb (similar to 9 \%) and SO2 by up
   to 0.3 ppb (similar to 27 \%)) and as a source for some others (e. g.,
   increasing fine-mode SO42- by up to 1.1 mu g m(-3) (similar to 12 \%)
   and PM2.5 by up to 1.4 mu g m(-3) (similar to 3 \%)) over the domain.
   The long-range transport of Asian pollutants can enhance the surface
   concentrations of gases by up to 3\% and aerosol species by up to 20\%
   in the Western US.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol composition and mixing state near anthropogenic sources can be
   highly variable and can challenge predictions of cloud condensation
   nuclei (CCN). The impacts of chemical composition on CCN activation
   kinetics is also an important, but largely unknown, aspect of cloud
   droplet formation. Towards this, we present in-situ size-resolved CCN
   measurements carried out during the 2008 summertime August Mini
   Intensive Gas and Aerosol Study (AMIGAS) campaign in Atlanta, GA.
   Aerosol chemical composition was measured by two particle-into-liquid
   samplers measuring water-soluble inorganic ions and total water-soluble
   organic carbon. Size-resolved CCN data were collected using the Scanning
   Mobility CCN Analysis (SMCA) method and were used to obtain
   characteristic aerosol hygroscopicity distributions, whose breadth
   reflects the aerosol compositional variability and mixing state.
   Knowledge of aerosol mixing state is important for accurate predictions
   of CCN concentrations and that the influence of an externally-mixed,
   CCN-active aerosol fraction varies with size from 31\% for particle
   diameters less than 40 nm to 93\% for accumulation mode aerosol during
   the day. Assuming size-dependent aerosol mixing state and size-invariant
   chemical composition decreases the average CCN concentration
   over-prediction (for all but one mixing state and chemical composition
   scenario considered) from over 190-240\% to less than 20 \%. CCN
   activity is parameterized using a single hygroscopicity parameter,
   kappa, which averages to 0.16 +/- 0.07 for 80 nm particles and exhibits
   considerable variability (from 0.03 to 0.48) throughout the study
   period. Particles in the 60-100 nm range exhibited similar
   hygroscopicity, with a kappa range for 60 nm between 0.06-0.076 (mean of
   0.18 +/- 0.09). Smaller particles (40 nm) had on average greater kappa,
   with a range of 0.20-0.92 (mean of 0.3 +/- 0.12). Analysis of the
   droplet activation kinetics of the aerosol sampled suggests that most of
   the CCN activate as rapidly as calibration aerosol, suggesting that
   aerosol composition exhibits a minor (if any) impact on CCN activation
   kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-based sensing represents a new paradigm for performing direct and
   accurate detection of cell- or tissue-specific responses by
   incorporating living cells or tissues as an integral part of a sensor.
   Here we report a new magnetic cell-based sensing platform by combining
   magnetic sensors implemented in the complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microelectronics process
   with cardiac progenitor cells that are differentiated directly on-chip.
   We show that the pulsatile movements of on-chip cardiac progenitor cells
   can be monitored in a real-time manner. Our work provides a new low-cost
   approach to enable high-throughput screening systems as used in drug
   development and handheld devices for point-of-care (PoC) biomedical
   diagnostic applications.}},

   for manufacturers and customers}},
Journal = {{MECHANIKA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{561-568}},
Abstract = {{Manufacturing of material handling equipment companies become more
   interested in the sustainability of their products. One possible
   approach to make material handling equipment more sustainable is to make
   it reconfigurable, reusable and reliable. Those products are likely to
   be reused when customers' requirements change. More sustainable material
   handling equipment can be much easier kysold in the future, due to the
   possibility to be reconfigured in accordance to the new customer
   requirements is high.
   This paper is focused on the development of a reverse logistics
   framework for more sustainable material handling equipment design. The
   novelty of the proposed reverse logistics framework is that it can
   reduce the backward flow of products to the manufacturer by enabling
   distributors to reconfigure products according to the renewed customer
   requirements. In the presented case study the benefits of employing
   sustainable reach truck were investigated. As a result, using
   sustainable product provides cost and flexibility advantages for both
   manufacturer and customer.}},

Title = {{Theory and modeling of nematic disclination branching under capillary
   confinement}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{11135-11143}},
Abstract = {{Defects in nematic liquid crystals under controlled confinement serve as
   a useful tool to characterize material properties as well as to reveal
   texture stability and pattern formation mechanisms in anisotropic soft
   matter. In particular, nematics inside micro-capillaries can exhibit a
   large variety of textures with point defects, line defects and loop
   defects, whose stability is dictated by factors such as geometry and
   temperature. In this paper we present a theoretical model, scaling, and
   simulation of a texture transition between two commonly observed
   patterns (planar polar and radial), through the uniform translation of a
   shape-invariant disclination branch point in generic calamitic nematic
   liquid crystals under capillary confinement and strong radial anchoring.
   Using the ``nematic elastica'' model derived from the Q-tensor Landau-de
   Gennes and n-vector Frank-Oseen equations, the geometry, stability, and
   energetics of disclination branching of a straight high order +1
   disclination into a pair of curved +1/2 disclinations under capillary
   confinement are fully characterized, including the branch angle, the
   curvature and final separation of the +1/2 lines, and the scaling of
   these quantities with the capillary radius (R). It is found that the
   branching and disclination shapes adjust to the capillary confinement by
   regulating their tension-to-bending stiffness ratio in such a way that
   the resulting branch angle is close to pi/3, the branch curvature is 3/R
   and the final disclination distance is 2R/(4)root 5. These new findings
   based on the ``nematic elastica'' are also useful to predict other novel
   structures that arise in conical and toroidal geometries of current
   interest and can be used to assess the Frank elasticity of nematic
   liquid crystals.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{45}},
Pages = {{11508-11513}},
Abstract = {{Using computational modeling, we probed the utility of actuated
   synthetic cilia for enhancing heat transport in microfluidic channels.
   Cilia are elastic filaments that are attached to the bottom channel wall
   with a constant tilt and actuated by a periodical vertical force applied
   to their free ends. We show that periodical oscillations of elastic
   cilia mix the heated fluid and create secondary flows in the
   microchannel that facilitate heat transport between channel walls. The
   magnitude of the secondary flows and the cilium deformation pattern are
   controlled by the frequency and amplitude of the periodic driving force.
   Thus, by varying the force parameters one can effectively regulate the
   local heat transport in ciliated microchannels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an alternative transmission system for remote wind

   introducing a three-phase six-pulse cycloconverter. The benefits of the
   LFAC transmission system are demonstrated as follows: reduced-investment
   cost compared with HVDC-transmission systems and increased power
   transfer capability as compared with 60Hz-HVAC transmission systems. In
   this paper, the economical and technical benefits of LFAC transmission
   systems are presented, the modeling method using the

Abstract = {{With the increased penetration of wind generation, the traditional
   control scheme of the wind turbine (WT), which is designed for maximum
   wind power extraction, is no longer suitable to meet emerging grid
   requirements for wind farms (WFs) to participate in frequency
   regulation. The control scheme of the WT with respect to grid frequency
   regulation is proposed in many studies, such as those on pitch control.
   Also, energy storage technologies have drawn much attention in recent
   years, as the technology matures and costs decrease, and present
   themselves as a potential solution for the challenge brought about by
   the uncertainty of renewable energy generation with regard to power
   system stability. A power system consisting of a high penetration of
   wind generation and energy storage systems (ESS) is investigated in this
   paper for the regulation of grid frequency. A new strategy called state
   of charge (SOC) feedback control is proposed and the performance of the
   grid frequency deviation response and the SOC of the battery are
   presented. The model of the power system studied in this paper is
   established on the MATLAB/SIMULINK platform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive power control algorithm for a

   based on the vector control algorithm for a two-level IGBT full power

   generation, with a hybrid DC-AC link topology, either in Maximum Power
   Point Tracking (MPPT) mode, or non-MPPT mode with enhanced tracking
   performance. The simulation proves that the proposed MPPT algorithm is
   much faster, more robust and adaptive to changes of the environment than
   the conventional variable-step Hill Climbing Search (HCS) algorithm,
   while the non-MPPT module has a fast response to the change of the power
   demand and the environment, and accurate steady state response as well.
   Moreover, the result shows that the control strategy can switch between
   the MPPT and non-MPPT automatically.}},

Title = {{PM10 characterization and source apportionment at two residential areas

Abstract = {{Bogota is the largest city in Colombia and is considered one of the most
   ones polluted in Latin America. The annual average PM10 concentration in
   the city is 55 mu g/m(3), being as high as 90 mu g/m(3) in the western
   region of the city. In this study, two sites in the western region were
   selected to assess the PM10 contribution from different sources. Two
   sets of fifty five 24-hour PM10 samples were taken at each site on
   quartz and Teflon filters. Chemical analysis of these samples was
   conducted to determine the ion, metal, and organic and elemental carbon
   concentrations. Ionic balance and mass closure were performed to check
   the consistency of chemical analysis. Positive Matrix Factorization
   (PMF) was then applied to determine the source contributions. Mobile
   sources and fugitive windblown dust were found to be the most
   significant sources of PM10 at both sites. An ion factor and a secondary
   aerosol source factor were identified at one site, whereas
   industry-related factors were identified at the other site, as expected
   in an area with a high density of small and medium industrial
   facilities. While it is true that source apportionment studies have been
   conducted worldwide, this is the first time that the Positive Matrix
   Factorization (PMF) model is applied in Bogota using full PM10 chemical
   speciation data, including carbonaceous materials, metals and ions. It
   is also the first time that a receptor model is applied simultaneously
   in two sites of the city. We aim that the results from this study will
   support environmental authorities in designing effective air pollution
   abatement measures in the city. (C) Author(s) 2012. This work is

   CUSUM chart}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{6574-6594}},
Abstract = {{WDFTC is a wavelet-based distribution-free CUSUM chart for detecting
   shifts in the mean of a profile with noisy components. Exploiting a
   discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of the mean in-control profile, WDFTC
   selects a reduced-dimension vector of the associated DWT components from
   which the mean in-control profile can be approximated with minimal
   weighted relative reconstruction error. Based on randomly sampled Phase
   I (in-control) profiles, the covariance matrix of the corresponding
   reduced-dimension DWT vectors is estimated using a matrix-regularisation
   method; then the DWT vectors are aggregated (batched) so that the
   non-overlapping batch means of the reduced-dimension DWT vectors have
   manageable covariances. To monitor shifts in the mean profile during
   Phase II operation, WDFTC computes a Hotelling's T-2-type statistic from
   successive non-overlapping batch means and applies a CUSUM procedure to
   those statistics, where the associated control limits are evaluated
   analytically from the Phase I data. Experimentation with several normal
   and non-normal test processes revealed that WDFTC was competitive with
   existing profile-monitoring schemes.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{7149-7166}},
Abstract = {{Production configuration is well recognised as an effective means of
   planning production processes for product families. The major challenge
   of production configuration originates from the handling of the numerous
   constraints associated with product and process variety. This paper
   develops a constraint satisfaction approach to facilitate production
   configuration decisions regarding constraint identification,
   representation, and evaluation. A domain-based model is formulated to
   conceptualise the production configuration process, involving
   inter-connections among multiple domains in conjunction with diverse
   domain decision variables and constraints. Within the domain framework,
   production configuration is formulated as a constraint satisfaction
   problem (CSP), which is solved using constraint heuristic search. Within
   constraint heuristic search, a decision propagation structure
   incorporating a connectionist approach is developed to facilitate the
   exploration of solution spaces. A case study of textile spindle
   production configuration is elaborated to illustrate the feasibility and
   potential of the domain-based CSP model for production configuration.}},

Title = {{Automatic Truck Processing Time Extraction at Marine Container Terminal
   Gates Using Low-Frame-Rate Images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{211-225}},
Abstract = {{Truck processing time, including the processing time per lane and per
   truck at a specific timestamp, at marine container terminal gates is
   crucial for measuring the performance of terminals. Truck processing
   time has traditionally been collected for short periods of time (e. g.,
   a few hours) through field observation. From the surveillance cameras
   widely available at terminal gates, researchers have attempted to
   collect truck processing time data by manually reviewing camera images
   frame by frame. However, this manual review process is labor-intensive
   and time-consuming. This study is motivated by the need for effectively
   collecting truck processing times over a long period of time. An
   image-processing algorithm to automatically extract truck processing
   time data using the low-frame-rate images (less than 1 frame per second,
   fps) is first proposed. The proposed algorithm includes three steps: (1)
   design of two region of interest (ROIs) per lane to capture truck
   trajectories, (2) a frame-differencing change-detection algorithm
   addressing the low frame rate and cast shadow issue, and (3) a unique
   state transition model with a set of decision rules, considering
   perspective occlusion and other potential sources of false positive
   detections, to reliably detect truck departures. An experimental test
   using one day's actual images in varying conditions was conducted to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental tests
   have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm's ability to
   meet the unique technical challenges at a terminal gate, including the
   following: day and night conditions, cast shadows, occlusion by work
   vehicles, people, and nearby trucks. An experimental test using 7,225
   images (6,567 day and 658 night operation images) was conducted to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental tests
   have also demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm for
   successfully detecting truck departures under several challenging
   situations, including perspective occlusion, cast shadows, nighttime and
   various lighting conditions, and multiple-lane departures. The correct
   detection rate is 98.1\% for daytime images and 90.8\% for nighttime
   images, giving our data a correct detection rate of 97.6\%.}},

Abstract = {{A process of ultra long metal nanowire bumps directly fabricated on a Si
   die and organic substrate has been developed. Typically, ultra long
   copper nanowire arrays were electroplated on the conductive pads of both
   a silicon die and organic substrate with matching peripheral row pads at
   200 mu m pitches using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template. The
   nanowires have an average diameter of 200 nm and lengths of about 30 mu
   m. After removing the template, nanowire bumps both on the silicon die
   and organic substrate have been obtained. A proof of concept of using
   these metal nanowire bumps as compliant z-axis interconnects is
   presented. Nanowire to nanowire interweaving ``Velcro{''}
   (http://www.velcro.com) type contact is established by lowering the die
   onto the substrate using a flip-chip bonder under controlled force. It
   was observed that the ``Velcro{''} type of interconnect has been
   enhanced by dispensing and curing a polymer material between the die and
   the substrate. A single mating pair of nanowire interconnects has been
   measured using a 4-point Kelvin probe method. This Velcro type of
   interconnect can be fabricated at a low temperature (depending on the
   polymer curing temperature) which may be advantageous for organic
   electronics, in 3D integration of stacked chips or other temperature
   sensitive interconnect applications.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing importance of 3D packaging systems, more and more dies
   will be stacked on top of each other and connected using through silicon
   vias (TSVs) and solder bumps. In-situ stress measurements near these
   bump pads are important to help understand the evolution of die stresses
   associated with the packaging process. Unlike piezoresistive doped Si
   sensors that require high-temperature processing, metal-based sensors
   use low-temperature fabrication processes. The sensor fabrication uses
   standard cleanroom processes such as UV lithography and physical vapor
   deposition.
   In this paper, thin-film micro-scale metallic (Ni/Cr) resistors have
   been studied with different design dimensions including gauge width,
   film thickness, and spacing between the lines in the serpentine pattern.
   Silicon test strips with sensors have been subjected to four-point bend
   testing, and finite-element simulations have been carried out to mimic
   the four-point bend testing as well as to determine stress contours

Abstract = {{In this paper, a fast electrical-thermal co-simulation method based on
   multigrid approach is proposed for simulating 3D systems. Using the
   proposed approach, accurate voltage/current distribution with
   temperature effect as well as temperature distribution with Joule
   heating effect can be obtained efficiently. By ensuring smoothly
   stretched gridding between die region and package region, fast
   convergence of multigrid method can be reached for both DC voltage drop
   and thermal simulations. The effect of non-uniform gridding on the
   convergence of multigrid is studied. The temperature effect on voltage
   drop and Joule heating effect on localized hotspot are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate the use of graphene as the basis for design
   and development of low-cost, self-powered, battery-less, wireless sensor
   solutions utilizing thin films produced from environmentally friendly,
   water-based, inkjet printed graphene oxide (GO) ink. The in-house
   developed novel sensor material demonstrates good response to ammonia
   gas (NH3), yielding a 6\% normalized resistance change within 15 minutes
   of exposure to a concentration of 500 ppm. In addition, excellent
   recovery time is achieved using the RGO thin films, with over 30\% of
   material recovery observed within 5 minutes without exposure to high
   temperature or any UV treatments. Finally, we present in this work
   important distinctive characteristics in the behavior of the RGO sensor
   when exposed to different types of gases, including the hard-to-detect
   CO gas, that can be exploited in order to further enhance the
   applicability of the material. The introduction of mass producible,
   stable, environmentally friendly, inkjet-printable GO on organic paper /

Abstract = {{The microelectronic packaging field is moving into the third dimension
   for miniaturization, low power consumption, and better performance. In
   this paper, we present a double-sided flip-chip organic substrate with a
   memory controller on one side of the package, and 3D stacked
   disaggregated memory chips on the other side of the package. This design
   allows the controller to interface with the DRAM stack directly through
   the substrate providing the shortest possible interconnect path, and
   thus achieving the fastest signaling speed. However, this double-sided
   flip chip on organic substrate also causes yield, assembly, test, and
   reliability challenges.
   In order to optimize the assembly process, a sequential 3D
   finite-element model was developed to simulate the package assembly
   process. In these simulations, various assembly process sequences were
   simulated with different conditions and materials. In addition, a
   probing test model was also built to study the connectivity of the Land
   Grid Array (LGA) pin array with the PCB sockets. Results show that the
   careful selection of assembly steps and package materials are crucial
   for the successful package assembly and also important for the probing

Abstract = {{Copper/low-k dielectrics are used in today's ICs to enhance electrical
   performance. The low-k interlayer dielectric (ILD) materials have low
   fracture strength due to the presence of pores or other inclusions to
   reduce the dielectric constant. During flip-chip assembly, when the
   die/substrate structure is cooled down from reflow temperature to room
   temperature, thermo-mechanical strains and stresses develop in the
   solder bumps. These thermally-induced stresses are due to the
   differential displacement between the substrate and the die as a result
   of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the die and
   the substrate. When the thermo-mechanical stresses are high, they can
   result either in ILD cracking or in ILD delamination in the vicinity of
   solder bump. This ILD fractures are circular in shape and appear as a
   white spot in C-mode scanning acoustic microscopy (CSAM) images, and
   thus, they are often referred to as ``white bumps.{''}
   In this paper, we present a finite-element-based submodeling approach to
   study the ILD cracking in flip-chip assemblies. The developed
   ``global{''} model accounts for the die, passivation layer, die pad,
   solder bump, substrate pad, and various layers in the substrate
   including the trace-pattern effective directional modulus. The
   displacement boundary conditions from the global model under flip-chip
   assembly cooling are then applied to a ``local model{''} which accounts
   for the die with its back-end-of-line (BEOL) stack, die pad, passivation
   layer, solder bump, substrate pad, and layers in the substrate. The
   local model focuses on the most critical solder bump, based on global
   stress contours. Next, cohesive and interfacial cracks are introduced in
   the ULK layers present in the BEOL stack, and the energy available for
   cohesive crack and interfacial crack propagation has been determined. It
   can be seen that energy available for crack propagation initially
   increases with crack length, but the energy starts to decay after a
   particular crack length indicating that the ILD cracking is often
   confined in the vicinity of one bump. The models can also provide
   valuable insight into ILD cracking for a wide range of geometry and
   material parameters. The results from the models have been compared
   against available experimental cohesive as well as interfacial fracture
   toughness data for Cu/dielectric material systems.}},

Abstract = {{On-chip integration of microfluidic devices are of great importance for
   analytical and bio-analytical applications(1, 2). In this study, a ``lab
   on chip{''} integrated micro glass microfluidic system based on the
   Micro-electromechanical System (MEMS) technology will be proposed
   including the fabrication of CFP process of a resonator and assembly of
   the on-chip system. The fabrication of the microfluidic chip including
   the micro reactors and channels with 3D spherical resonator integrated
   was firstly introduced. The resonators were driven by the Lorentz force
   by inducing alternation current into the serrate lead at the surface of
   the bulbiform glass resonators if the frequency alternation current is
   equal to the natural resonance of the glass bubbles. The ultrasonic wave
   originated by the glass bubbles will be transported by the water and be
   focused at the center of the spherical glass bubbles to get a high
   energy density. The next part was the integration of an alternating
   current (AC) source and the microfluidic chip on the same printed
   circuit board (PCB). A power amplifier was also integrated on the PCB
   since it was difficult to find an AC current generator producing current
   according to the requirement of the resonator. The final part was the
   injection of a solution containing the biological samples, such as DNA
   strand or cells. These samples could be seared or smashed by the
   ultrasonic wave to obtain the product we wanted.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites have attracted tremendous interest for advanced
   electronic packaging applications due to their superior electrical,
   thermal and optical properties. The dispersion of nanometer sized
   fillers in a polymer matrix, however, is very challenging in the
   preparation of these nanocomposites, because the nanoparticles have a
   strong tendency to aggregate. An objective and accurate dispersion
   analysis method is needed to evaluate the dispersion quality and improve

   triple track resistors (TTR). An O-2 plasma treatment was used to
   generate surface roughness on the cured epoxy. SH surfaces were produced
   after functionalization with perfluorooctyl trichlorosilane of low
   surface energy. The effect of plasma etching time on superhydrophobicty
   was investigated. A water contact angle of 170 degrees and contact angle
   hysteresis of 2 degrees were achieved when the etching time increased to
   15 min. The leakage currents under bias for SH coated TTR were measured
   with aging time. The reliability test showed stable leakage current for
   1000 hours, and the self-cleaning performance of the SH surface

Abstract = {{For current LED packaging technology, one of the major limitations is
   the low light extraction efficiency, due to the refractive index (RI)
   difference between LED chip and air. Moreover, the trapped light in LED
   may convert into heat and further lower the conversion efficiency and
   reduction in the LED reliability. Encapsulants such as epoxy and
   silicone are usually added to reduce the RI contrast and enlarge the
   light escape cone. But the RI of epoxy or silicone is usually limited to
   1.45 to 1.55. High RI particles can be added to help increase the RI of
   encapsulant. The particle size should be controlled smaller than one
   tenth of the visible light wavelength (400-800nm), in order to reduce
   Rayleigh scattering and increase the transmittance of encapsulant
   effectively. In this study, we prepared zinc oxide (ZnO) quantum dots
   (QDs)/epoxy nanocomoposites as LED encapsulant. The dispersion of QDs
   was further improved through the addition of exfoliated a-zirconium
   phosphate (ZrP) nanoplatelets (NPs). As a result, the RI of
   nanocomposites increased from 1.50 to 1.52 at 589 nm wavelength with 8
   wt\% filler loading while maintaining high transmittance. The solvent
   effect on RI was also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Systems can be arranged in useful ways to perform tasks which, executed
   in an order, unlock overall capabilities. The goal of a system of
   systems engineer is to find the system arrangements and task execution
   order that allow the system of systems successfully achieving its end
   goal efficiently. The difficulties in this work are the sheer number of
   possible arrangements and work flows, uncertain and missing information
   about systems, and greater flexibility required in evaluation compared
   to system evaluation. This paper describes a modeling and simulation
   solution that deals with all the three difficulties enumerated as part
   of a research work sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. The
   modeling and simulation solution implemented here is in the form of a
   discrete event simulation. Because system of systems design involves
   itself with many missions, the simulation is developed to handle various
   missions and systems. However, in this paper the use case is a
   suppression of enemy air defenses mission carried out by a variety of

Abstract = {{A central element in the use of Space as a power grid for near-real-time
   power exchange, is a constellation of satellites, capable of receiving
   and relaying beamed power at multi-megawatt level with extremely high
   efficiency and low thermal losses. The conceptual design of such a
   satellite is considered in this paper. Preliminary calculations indicate
   that power delivery and transmission will use millimeter waveguides
   inside the satellite to guide the power between antennae, and as feeds
   for the antennae. The paper seeks solutions for the milimeter
   waveguides, antennae and thermal control systems in order to refine the
   mass and efficiency estimates. While the standardized design is for
   2000-kilometer orbits, an option to use fewer satellites between as few
   as two participating nations at 5500 km is also considered at the
   startup of the system. The NASA system design process is followed
   wherever practical. However, some innovations are required beyond to
   move into the regime of 60MW power beams with millimeter waveguides.
   Corrugated waveguides are identified as a solution for 220 GHz beam
   redirection, directly coupled to antenna elements.}},

Abstract = {{The U. S and the U. S. S. R. have sent seventeen successful atmospheric
   entry missions to Venus. Past missions to Venus have utilized rigid
   aeroshell systems for entry. This rigid aeroshell paradigm sets
   performance limitations since the size of the entry vehicle is
   constrained by the fairing diameter of the launch vehicle. This has
   limited ballistic coefficients (beta) to well above 100 kg/m(2) for the
   entry vehicles. In order to maximize the science payload and minimize
   the Thermal Protection System (TPS) mass, these missions have entered at
   very steep entry flight path angles (gamma). Due to Venus' thick
   atmosphere and the steep-gamma, high-beta conditions, these entry
   vehicles have been exposed to very high heat flux, very high pressures
   and extreme decelerations (upwards of 100 g's).
   Deployable aeroshells avoid the launch vehicle fairing diameter
   constraint by expanding to a larger diameter after the launch. Due to
   the potentially larger wetted area, deployable aeroshells achieve lower
   ballistic coefficients (well below 100 kg/m(2)), and if they are flown
   at shallower flight path angles, the entry vehicle can access
   trajectories with far lower decelerations (similar to 50-60 g's), peak
   heat fluxes (similar to 400 W/cm(2)) and peak pressures. The structural
   and TPS mass of the shallow-gamma, low-beta deployables are lower than
   their steep-gamma, high-beta rigid aeroshell counterparts at larger
   diameters, contributing to lower areal densities and potentially higher
   payload mass fractions. For example, at large diameters, deployables may
   attain aeroshell areal densities of 10 kg/m(2) as opposed to 50 kg/m(2)
   for rigid aeroshells. However, the low-beta, shallow-gamma paradigm also
   raises issues, such as the possibility of skip-out during entry. The
   shallow-gamma could also increase the landing footprint of the vehicle.
   Furthermore, the deployable entry systems may be flexible, so there
   could be fluid-structure interaction, especially in the high altitude,
   low-density regimes. The need for precision in guidance, navigation and
   control during entry also has to be better understood. This paper
   investigates some of the challenges facing the design of a
   shallow-gamma, low-beta entry system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and testing of two cold-capable SiGe
   BiCMOS wireline transceivers targeted for applications in distributed
   electronics systems in space-based vehicles. Space-based electronic
   systems face extremely wide temperature ranges and hazardous radiation
   that can cause unpredicted behavior in sensitive circuitry. The most
   common mitigation procedure involves extensive shielding and temperature
   control in ``electronics vaults.{''} Unfortunately, this practice comes
   with a high cost in weight, power, and volume. Recently, there has been
   a paradigm shift that advocates moving away from these centralized
   solutions and towards distributed electronic systems. The transceivers
   presented in this work were designed to be a part of a larger system
   created to demonstrate that SiGe BiCMOS technology was a viable
   candidate for implementing extreme environment electronics. Both the
   RS-485 transceiver and ISO 11898 transmitter will be shown to work
   robustly up to 20 Mbps and in measurement from 90 K to 390 K, with
   consistent rise/fall times, propagation delays, and output amplitudes.
   This work adds a piece to the distributed electronics puzzle by enabling
   robust communication throughout space-based systems with minimal
   temperature control.}},

Abstract = {{Current Mars entry, descent, and landing technology is near its
   performance limit and is unable to land payloads on the surface that
   exceed approximately 1 metric ton. One option for increasing landed
   payload mass capability is decreasing the entry vehicle's hypersonic
   ballistic coefficient. A lower ballistic coefficient vehicle decelerates
   higher in the atmosphere, providing additional timeline and altitude
   margin necessary for heavier payloads. This study analyzed the guided
   entry performance of concept low ballistic coefficient vehicles at Mars.
   A terminal point controller guidance algorithm was used to provide
   precision targeting capability. Accuracy at parachute deploy, peak
   deceleration, peak heat rate, and integrated heat load were assessed and
   compared to a traditional vehicle to determine the effects of lowering
   the vehicle ballistic coefficient on entry performance. Results from
   this study suggest that while accuracy at parachute deploy degrades with
   decreasing ballistic coefficient, accuracy and other performance metrics
   remain within reasonable bounds for ballistic coefficients as low as 1
   kg/m(2). As such, this investigation demonstrates that from a
   performance standpoint, guided entry vehicles with large diameters may
   be feasible at Mars.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by living neuron networks (LNNs) in the brain, artificial
   neural networks (ANNs) have been broadly used in various applications as
   a computational intelligence tool. However, due to many fundamental
   differences between ANNs and LNNs, despite the mature training
   mechanisms for ANNs, it is often challenging to use LNNs as a
   computational intelligence tool. To bridge the gap between ANNs and
   LNNs, a novel type of artificial neural network, i.e.
   biologically-inspired artificial neural network (BIANN) is proposed in
   this paper. The BIANN, which is based on spiking neuron models of LNNs,
   processes information in a more ``brain-like{''} fashion than
   conventional ANNs. A reservoir-computing-based training approach is also
   proposed for BIANNs to serve as a novel modeling and control tool for
   practical applications. The feasibility of the proposed BIANN is
   illustrated for the prediction of a synchronous generator's speed and
   terminal voltage signals in a single machine infinite bus electric power
   system setup. The proposed BIANN model is able to provide an accurate
   prediction for online monitoring of a generator.}},

Abstract = {{The results of large eddy simulations (LESs) of turbulent flow in a
   compound open channel with deep and shallow flood plain depths are
   presented. These LESs are validated with experimental data, resulting in
   a good agreement between measured and calculated data. The
   floodplain-depth-to-main-channel-depth ratio is an important parameter
   affecting first-and second-order turbulence statistics. The streamwise
   momentum balance is analysed with respect to the momentum transfer at
   the interface between the main channel and the floodplain.
   Depth-averaging of the streamwise momentum equation reveals the
   dominance of turbulent shear stress terms in the main channel and of
   secondary currents in the floodplain. Comparisons of the LES results
   with an analytical solution of the depth-averaged streamwise momentum
   equation that demonstrate the importance of case-specific calibration of
   the parameters of the analytical solution. The turbulence anisotropy is
   quantified and its role in generating secondary currents is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent paper by Monteiro and Svaiter, a hybrid proximal

   paper is to extend this analysis to study a prox-type first-order method
   for monotone smooth variational inequalities and inclusion problems
   consisting of the sum of a smooth monotone map and a maximal monotone
   point-to-set operator. Each iteration of the method computes an
   approximate solution of a proximal subproblem obtained by linearizing
   the smooth part of the operator in the corresponding proximal equation
   for the original problem, which is then used to perform an extragradient
   step as prescribed by the HPE framework. Both pointwise and ergodic
   iteration-complexity results are derived for the aforementioned
   first-order method using corresponding results obtained here for a
   subfamily of the HPE framework.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous-multithreading (SMT) is widely used to improve the overall
   efficiency of superscalar CPUs with hardware multi-threading. With SMT
   processors, it is challenging to guarantee the performance of each
   individual thread because resources are shared across the threads. In
   this paper, we study the scenario where user applications need to
   guarantee a certain level of performance for a primary thread. We
   present a hardware-software integrated method to control thread priority
   to achieve this objective. This method combines hardware thread priority
   control (which is currently available on IBM POWER processor series) and
   performance monitoring unit, and dynamically adjusts CPU resource
   allocations according to current thread workloads. Effectiveness of the
   proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a widely used probabilistic
   clustering model. The incremental learning algorithm of GMM is the basis
   of a variety of complex incremental learning algorithms. It is typically
   applied to real-time or massive data problems where the standard
   Expectation Maximum (EM) algorithm does not work. But the output of the
   incremental learning algorithm may exhibit degraded cluster quality than
   the standard EM algorithm. In order to achieve a high-quality and fast
   incremental GMM learning algorithm, we develop an algorithmic method for
   incremental learning of GMM in a GPU-CPU hybrid system. Our method uses
   model evolution history to approximate the model order and adopts both
   hypothesis-test and Euclidean distance to do mixture component equality
   test. Through experiments we show that our method achieves high
   performance in terms of both cluster quality and speed.}},

Abstract = {{We present new analysis, algorithmic techniques, and implementations of
   the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) for solving N-body problems. Our
   research specifically addresses two key challenges. The first challenge
   is how to engineer fast code for today's platforms. We present the first
   in-depth study of multicore optimizations and tuning for FMM, along with
   a systematic approach for transforming a conventionally-parallelized FMM
   into a highly-tuned one. We introduce novel optimizations that
   significantly improve the within-node scalability of the FMM, thereby
   enabling high-performance in the face of multicore and manycore systems.
   The second challenge is how to understand scalability on future systems.
   We present a new algorithmic complexity analysis of the FMM that
   considers both intra-and inter-node communication costs. This analysis
   yields the surprising prediction that although the FMM is largely
   compute-bound today, and therefore highly scalable on current systems,
   the trajectory of processor architecture designs-if there are no
   significant changes-could cause it to become communication-bound as
   early as the year 2020. This prediction suggests the utility of our
   analysis approach, which directly relates algorithmic and architectural
   characteristics, for enabling a new kind of high-level
   algorithm-architecture co-design.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of networked systems (including artificial or biological
   neuronal networks) to perform complex data processing tasks relies in
   part on their ability to encode signals from the recent past in the
   current network state. Here we use Compressed Sensing tools to study the
   ability of a particular network architecture (Echo State Networks) to
   stably store long input sequences. In particular, we show that such
   networks satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property when the input
   sequences are compressible in certain bases and when the number of nodes
   scale linearly with the sparsity of the input sequence and
   logarithmically with its dimension. Thus, the memory capacity of these
   networks depends on the input sequence statistics, and can (sometimes
   greatly) exceed the number of nodes in the network. Furthermore, input
   sequences can be robustly recovered from the instantaneous network state
   using a tractable optimization program (also implementable in a network
   architecture).}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the existence of considerable amount of redundancy in the
   Internet traffic has stimulated the deployment of several redundancy
   elimination techniques within the network. These techniques are often
   based on either packet-level Redundancy Elimination (RE) or
   Content-Centric Networking (CCN). However, these techniques cannot
   exploit sub-packet redundancies. Further, other alternative techniques
   such as the end-to-end universal compression solutions would not perform
   well either over the Internet traffic, as such techniques require
   infinite length traffic to effectively remove redundancy. This paper
   proposes a memory-assisted universal compression technique that holds a
   significant promise for reducing the amount of traffic in the networks.
   The proposed work is based on the observation that if a source is to be
   compressed and sent over a network, the associated universal code
   entails a substantial overhead in transmission due to finite length
   traffic. However, intermediate nodes can learn the source statistics and
   this can be used to reduce the cost of describing the source statistics,
   reducing the transmission overhead for such traffics. We present two
   algorithms (statistical and dictionary-based) for the memory-assisted
   universal lossless compression of information sources. These schemes are
   universal in the sense that they do not require any prior knowledge of
   the traffic's statistical distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness
   of both algorithms and characterize the memorization gain using the real
   Internet traces. Furthermore, we apply these compression schemes to
   Internet-like power-law graphs and solve the routing problem for
   compressed flows. We characterize the network-wide gain of the
   memorization from the information theoretic point of view. In
   particular, through our analysis on power-law graphs, we show that
   non-vanishing network-wide gain of memorization is obtained even when
   the number of memory units is a tiny fraction of the total number of
   nodes in the network. Finally, we validate our predictions of the
   memorization gain by simulation on real traffic traces.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic induction (MI)-based wireless underground sensor networks
   (WUSNs) use the novel MI waveguide technique to establish long range and
   low cost wireless communications in harsh underground environments,
   which enable a large variety of novel and important applications. One of
   the main research challenges is the theoretical study of the channel and
   network capacities in these networks. Compared to the traditional
   wireless networks, both the channel and network capacities of MI-based
   WUSNs have significant different characteristics due to the completely
   different signal propagation techniques and network geometric structure.
   Moreover, the usage of multiple resonant MI relay coils in MI-based
   WUSNs brings more reliability concerns. In this paper, mathematical
   models are developed to evaluate the channel capacity, network capacity,
   and the reliability of MI-based WUSNs. Specifically, the closed-form
   expression for the channel capacity in MI-based WUSNs is first derived
   to capture the effects of multiple system parameters. Then the network
   capacity scaling laws of MI-based WUSNs are investigated under different
   deployment strategies. Finally, the system reliability of MI-based WUSNs
   in terms of the channel capacity and network capacity is discussed. The
   results of this paper provide principles and guidelines for the design

Journal = {{CHEMSUSCHEM}},

Pages = {{2058-2064}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental study on the adsorption properties of primary, secondary,
   and tertiary amine materials is used to evaluate what amine type(s) are
   best suited for ultradilute CO2 capture applications. A series of
   comparable materials comprised of primary, secondary, or tertiary amines
   ligated to a mesoporous silica support via a propyl linker are used to
   systematically assess the role of amine type. Both CO2 and water
   adsorption isotherms are presented for these materials in the range
   relevant to CO2 capture from ambient air and it is demonstrated that
   primary amines are the best candidates for CO2 capture from air. Primary
   amines possess both the highest amine efficiency for CO2 adsorption as
   well as enhanced water affinity compared to other amine types or the
   bare silica support. The results suggest that the rational design of
   amine adsorbents for the extraction of CO2 from ambient air should focus
   on adsorbents rich in primary amines.}},

Pages = {{1369-1387}},
Abstract = {{Technology portfolio selection is a combinatorial optimization problem
   often faced with a large number of combinations and technology
   incompatibilities. The main research question addressed in this article
   is to determine if Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is better suited than
   Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Simulated Annealing (SA) for technology
   portfolio optimization when incompatibility constraints between
   technologies are present. Convergence rate, capability to find optima,
   and efficiency in handling of incompatibilities are the three criteria
   of comparison. The application problem consists of finding the best
   technology portfolio from 29 aircraft technologies. The results show
   that ACO and GAs converge faster and find optima more easily than SA,
   and that ACO can optimize portfolios with technology incompatibilities
   without using penalty functions. This latter finding paves the way for
   more use of ACO when the number of constraints increases, such as in the
   technology and concept selection for complex engineering systems.}},

   often produces undesired oscillations which cause net movements that are
   difficult to predict. In this paper we present a framework for
   implementing gaits which will allow for smooth transitions. We also
   present a method to determine the optimal time for each module of the
   snake to switch between gaits in a decentralized fashion. This will
   allow for each module to participate in minimizing a cost by
   communicating with a set of modules in a local neighborhood. Both of
   these developments will help to maintain desired properties of the gaits
   during transition.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by large fatality rates due to fires in crowded areas and the
   increasing presence of robots in dangerous emergency situations, we have
   implemented a model of information propagation among evacuees.
   Information about the locations of exits and the relative confidence of
   the individual in the location of the exit disseminated through a
   simulated crowd of people during an evacuation modeled after The Station
   Nightclub fire of 2003. True believers were added to this system as
   individuals who refused to accept exit information from others, instead
   preferring to head to their own exit. This system was then tested to
   find what percentage of true believers most likely existed in the actual
   fire. Using this true believer percentage, robots were added to the
   environment to guide evacuees to the nearest exit. The number of people
   who believed a robot's instructions was varied to find what percentage
   of people need to trust these robots in order to exploit information
   propagation and thus increase survivability. As a lower bound, we have
   found that 30\% of the evacuees should believe a robot's instructions to
   significantly increase survival rates.}},

Abstract = {{We present the successful application of reconfigurable

   path planning. However, ASICs are typically fixed circuit designs that
   require long fabrication times on the order of months. In contrast, our
   reconfigurable analog circuits called Field Programmable Analog Arrays
   (FPAAs) implement a variety of AVLSI circuits in minutes. We present
   experimental results of online robot path planning using FPAA circuitry,
   validating our assertion that FPAA-based AVLSI design is a feasible
   approach to computing complete motion plans using analog floating-gate
   resistive grids. We demonstrate the integration of FPAA hardware and
   software with a real robot platform and hardware in the loop
   simulations, present the trajectories developed by our planner and
   provide analysis of the time and space complexity of our proposed
   approach. The paper concludes by formulating metrics that identify
   domains where analog solutions to planning may be faster and more

Abstract = {{Vehicular networks are meant to exist wherever the road will take them.
   This includes small towns, rural highways, suburbs, downtown urban

   implementing Quality of Service (QoS) as well as a relatively similar
   method that inserts stochastic delays in pseudonym (PN) transmission in
   the two urban settings of a downtown grid and an urban highway, both
   under heavily congested conditions. The simulated results (using ns-3)
   are compared to previous work that examined communication suppression
   (as opposed to priority as in this work). Four metrics are used for
   method comparison: average overall background data throughput, average
   overall PNs distributed, maximum number of PNs distributed, and the
   distribution of the PNs across the vehicles as a function of need. While
   some of the results obtained were expected, the overall conclusion that
   implementing quality of service, or even a simplistic imitation, can
   significantly improve the overall data throughput and provide more PNs

Abstract = {{Both performance and energy cost are important concerns for current data
   center operators. Traditionally, however, IT and mechanical engineers
   have separately optimized the cyber vs. physical aspects of data center
   operations. In contrast, the work presented in this paper jointly
   considers both the IT -cyber - and the physical systems in data centers,
   the eventual goal being to develop performance and power management
   techniques that holistically operate to control the entire complex of
   data center installations. Toward this end, we propose a balance of
   payments model for holistic power and performance management. As an
   example of coordinated data center management system, the energy-aware
   cyber-physical system (EaCPS) uses an application controller on the
   cyber side to guarantee application performance, and on the physical
   side, it utilizes electric current-aware capacity management (CACM) to
   smartly place executables to reduce the energy consumption of each
   chassis present in a data center rack. A web application, representative
   of a multi-tier web site, is used to evaluate the performance of the
   controller on the cyber side, the CACM control on the physical side, and
   of the holistic EaCPS methods in a mid-size, instrumented data center.
   Results indicate that coordinated EaCPS outperforms the cyber and
   physical control modules working separately.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{9041-9055}},
Abstract = {{We present the development of the adjoint of a comprehensive cloud
   droplet formation parameterization for use in aerosol-cloud-climate
   interaction studies. The adjoint efficiently and accurately calculates
   the sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to all
   parameterization inputs (e. g., updraft velocity, water uptake
   coefficient, aerosol number and hygroscopicity) with a single execution.
   The adjoint is then integrated within three dimensional (3-D) aerosol
   modeling frameworks to quantify the sensitivity of CDNC formation
   globally to each parameter. Sensitivities are computed for year-long
   executions of the NASA Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) Chemical
   Transport Model (CTM), using wind fields computed with the Goddard
   Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Global Circulation Model (GCM) II',
   and the GEOS-Chem CTM, driven by meteorological input from the Goddard
   Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Global Modeling and
   Assimilation Office (GMAO). We find that over polluted (pristine) areas,
   CDNC is more sensitive to updraft velocity and uptake coefficient
   (aerosol number and hygroscopicity). Over the oceans of the Northern
   Hemisphere, addition of anthropogenic or biomass burning aerosol is
   predicted to increase CDNC in contrast to coarse-mode sea salt which
   tends to decrease CDNC. Over the Southern Oceans, CDNC is most sensitive
   to sea salt, which is the main aerosol component of the region.
   Globally, CDNC is predicted to be less sensitive to changes in the
   hygroscopicity of the aerosols than in their concentration with the
   exception of dust where CDNC is very sensitive to particle
   hydrophilicity over arid areas. Regionally, the sensitivities differ
   considerably between the two frameworks and quantitatively reveal why
   the models differ considerably in their indirect forcing estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Sulphuric acid is a key component in atmospheric new particle formation.
   However, sulphuric acid alone does not form stable enough clusters to
   initiate particle formation in atmospheric conditions. Strong bases,
   such as amines, have been suggested to stabilize sulphuric acid clusters
   and thus participate in particle formation. We modelled the formation
   rate of clusters with two sulphuric acid and two amine molecules
   (J(A2B2)) at varying atmospherically relevant conditions with respect to
   concentrations of sulphuric acid ({[}H2SO4]), dimethylamine ({[}DMA])
   and trimethylamine ({[}TMA]), temperature and relative humidity (RH). We
   also tested how the model results change if we assume that the clusters
   with two sulphuric acid and two amine molecules would act as seeds for
   heterogeneous nucleation of organic vapours (other than amines) with
   higher atmospheric concentrations than sulphuric acid. The modelled
   formation rates J(A2B2) were functions of sulphuric acid concentration
   with close to quadratic dependence, which is in good agreement with
   atmospheric observations of the connection between the particle
   formation rate and sulphuric acid concentration. The coefficients K-A2B2
   connecting the cluster formation rate and sulphuric acid concentrations
   as J(A2B2) = K-A2B2{[}H2SO4](2) turned out to depend also on amine
   concentrations, temperature and relative humidity. We compared the
   modelled coefficients K-A2B2 with the corresponding coefficients
   calculated from the atmospheric observations (K-obs) from environments
   with varying temperatures and levels of anthropogenic influence. By
   taking into account the modelled behaviour of J(A2B2) as a function of
   {[}H2SO4], temperature and RH, the atmospheric particle formation rate
   was reproduced more closely than with the traditional semi-empirical
   formulae based on sulphuric acid concentration only. The formation rates
   of clusters with two sulphuric acid and two amine molecules with
   different amine compositions (DMA or TMA or one of both) had different
   responses to varying meteorological conditions and concentrations of
   vapours participating in particle formation. The observed inverse
   proportionality of the coefficient K-obs with RH and temperature agreed
   best with the modelled coefficient K-A2B2 related to formation of a
   cluster with two H2SO4 and one or two TMA molecules, assuming that these
   clusters can grow in collisions with abundant organic vapour molecules.
   In case this assumption is valid, our results suggest that the formation
   rate of clusters with at least two of both sulphuric acid and amine
   molecules might be the rate-limiting step for atmospheric particle
   formation. More generally, our analysis elucidates the sensitivity of
   the atmospheric particle formation rate to meteorological variables and
   concentrations of vapours participating in particle formation (also
   other than H2SO4).}},

Abstract = {{The design of optimal bioreactor systems for tissue engineering
   applications requires a sophisticated understanding of the complexities
   of the bioreactor environment and the role that it plays in the
   formation of engineered tissues. To this end, a tissue growth model is
   developed to characterize the tissue growth and extracellular matrix
   synthesis by chondrocytes seeded and cultivated on polyglycolic acid
   scaffolds in a wavy-walled bioreactor for a period of 4 weeks. This
   model consists of four components: (1) a computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) model to characterize the complex hydrodynamic environment in the
   bioreactor, (2) a kinetic growth model to characterize the cell growth
   and extracellular matrix production dynamics, (3) an artificial neural
   network (ANN) that empirically correlates hydrodynamic parameters with
   kinetic constants, and (4) a second ANN that correlates the biochemical
   composition of constructs with their material properties. In tandem,
   these components enable the prediction of the dynamics of tissue growth,
   as well as the final compositional and mechanical properties of
   engineered cartilage. The growth model methodology developed in this
   study serves as a tool to predict optimal bioprocessing conditions
   required to achieve desired tissue properties.}},

Abstract = {{A paradigm shift is taking place in orthopaedic and reconstructive
   surgery. This transition from using medical devices and tissue grafts
   towards the utilization of a tissue engineering approach combines
   biodegradable scaffolds with cells and/or biological molecules in order
   to repair and/or regenerate tissues. One of the potential benefits
   offered by solid freeform fabrication (SFF) technologies is the ability
   to create such biodegradable scaffolds with highly reproducible
   architecture and compositional variation across the entire scaffold due
   to their tightly controlled computer-driven fabrication. Many of these
   biologically activated materials can induce bone formation at ectopic
   and orthotopic sites, but they have not yet gained widespread use due to
   several continuing limitations, including poor mechanical properties,
   difficulties in intraoperative handling, lack of porosity suitable for
   cellular and vascular infiltration, and suboptimal degradation
   characteristics. In this chapter, we define scaffold properties and
   attempt to provide some broad criteria and constraints for scaffold
   design and fabrication in combination with growth factors for bone
   engineering applications. Lastly, we comment on the current and future
   developments in the field, such as the functionalization of novel
   composite scaffolds with combinations of growth factors designed to
   promote cell attachment, cell survival, vascular ingrowth, and
   osteoinduction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a self-testable SiGe low noise amplifier (LNA) is
   designed and a Built-in-Self-Test (BIST) methodology is proposed for
   amplifiers embedded in RF systems. In this BIST methodology, the RF
   amplifier has the capability to simultaneously test multiple performance
   specifications on-chip, including Gain and P1dB. The self-testable LNA
   can be placed in a testing mode, in which it self generates a signature
   of its health using oscillation principles. It eliminates the
   requirement of any external test stimulus for testing purposes, thus
   enables the possibility of self-testable RF designs. For the proof of
   concept, the presented SiGe LNA is designed to operate in the X-band
   (9.0 GHz) in a commercially-available 6 metal layer, 0.18 mu m, 120 GHz
   SiGe BiCMOS platform. This self-testing design concept can be extended
   to CMOS amplifiers as well. Furthermore, in this paper, the
   built-in-self-test methodology is demonstrated using board-level as well

Abstract = {{Based on the property of angular dependent transmission probability of
   electrons observed in graphene PN junctions, a modified MUX-based
   graphene logic device is introduced. A more elaborate resistance model
   including ON resistance, leakage resistance and contact resistance is
   given as well as a capacitance model of the device. Compared with Si
   CMOS switches, MUX-based logic graphene gates have potentially lower
   output resistances and a smaller device area. Since interconnects play
   an ever increasing important role in digital circuit, for the first
   time, module-level and system-level analyses are made for better
   evaluating the potential performance of graphene logic devices. Based on
   the analysis of a 32-bit Han-Carlson adder, module-level evaluation has
   been done and comparison has been made between graphene logic circuits
   complemented by multi-layer graphene interconnects and CMOS logic
   circuits with Cu/low k interconnects. The results indicate that
   MUX-based graphene logic circuits can outperform CMOS circuits in terms
   of both delay and power consumption. Both devices being evaluated are
   based on the 15nm technology node. For the system-level analysis, the
   graphene logic system can have 50\% higher throughput than its Si CMOS
   counterpart with the same power density and die size area.}},

   parasitic capacitance can result in delay overhead affecting the delay
   of 3D ICs. Meanwhile, with the development of TSV manufacturing
   technology, nano-scale TSVs are emerging, which is expected to reduce
   the overheads caused by using large TSVs. Therefore, this paper
   investigates the impact of nano-scale TSVs on the quality of 3D ICs at
   future technology nodes. For this study, we develop a 16nm standard cell
   library, design 3D ICs using different process technologies (45nm, 22nm,
   and 16nm) and various TSVs diameters (from 5 mu m to 0.1 mu m), and
   discuss the impact of nano-scale TSVs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithmic approach for improving the
   performance of many types of stochastic dynamical simulations. The
   approach is to redesign existing algorithms that use sparse
   matrix-vector products (SPMV) with single vectors to instead use a more
   efficient kernel, the generalized SPMV (GSPMV), which computes with
   multiple vectors simultaneously. In this paper, we show how to redesign
   a dynamical simulation to exploit GSPMV in way that is not initially
   obvious because only one vector is available at a time. We study the
   performance of GSPMV as a function of the number of vectors, and
   demonstrate the use of GSPMV in the Stokesian dynamics method for the
   simulation of the motion of macromolecules in the cell. Specifically,
   for our application, we find that with modern multicore Intel
   microprocessors in clusters of up to 64 nodes, we can typically multiply
   by 8 to 16 vectors in only twice the time required to multiply by a
   single vector. After redesigning the Stokesian dynamics algorithm to
   exploit GSPMV, we measure a 30 percent speedup in performance in
   single-node, data parallel simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In software transactional memory (STM) systems, the contention
   management (CM) policy decides what action to take when a conflict
   occurs. CM is crucial to the performance of STM systems. However, the
   performance of existing CMs is sensitive to transaction workload and
   system platforms. A static policy is therefore unsatisfactory. In this
   paper, we argue that adaptive contention management is necessary and
   feasible. We further present a profiling-based method that can choose a
   suitable CM for a given workload and system platform during run-time. We
   also propose to use logic-time (transactional commit or abort events) to
   measure the profiling length and compare it with the traditional
   physical-time-based method. Experimental results demonstrate that our
   proposed adaptive contention manager (ACM) outperforms static CMs across
   benchmarks and platforms. In particular, the ACM that uses the number of
   aborts for the profiling length performs better than others.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we have proposed and designed FindingHuMo (Finding Human
   Motion), a real-time user tracking system for Smart Environments.
   FindingHuMo can perform device-free tracking of multiple (unknown and
   variable number of) users in the Hallway Environments, just from
   non-invasive and anonymous (not user specific) binary motion sensor data
   stream. The significance of our designed system are as follows: (a) fast
   tracking of individual targets from binary motion datastream from a
   static wireless sensor network in the infrastructure. This needs to
   resolve unreliable node sequences, system noise and path ambiguity; (b)
   Scaling for multi-user tracking where user motion trajectories may
   crossover with each other in all possible ways. This needs to resolve
   path ambiguity to isolate overlapping trajectories; FindingHumo applies
   the following techniques on the collected motion datastream: (i) a
   proposed motion data driven adaptive order Hidden Markov Model with
   Viterbi decoding (called Adaptive-HMM), and then (ii) an innovative path
   disambiguation algorithm (called CPDA). Using this methodology the
   system accurately detects and isolates motion trajectories of individual
   users. The system performance is illustrated with results from real-time
   system deployment experience in a Smart Environment.}},

Abstract = {{One of the hard issues that arises in distributed navigation is keeping
   an up-to-date and consistent estimation of the dependency between the
   solutions computed by each one of the involved agents. This issue is
   critical for the consistent information fusion in distributed
   cooperative navigation and was recently tackled using a graph-based
   approach for the on-demand calculation of cross-covariance terms. In
   particular, the approach was applied to a method for visual aided,
   distributed cooperative navigation based on three-view geometry
   constraints, in which a measurement is formulated whenever the same
   scene is observed by several robots, not necessarily at the same time.
   The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the claim that on-demand
   calculation of cross-covariance terms in three-view-based cooperative
   navigation is further substantiated, and the difficulties with other
   existing techniques are emphasized. Second, the efficiency of using the
   on-demand calculations is validated by comparing the results to those
   obtained by assuming the three-view multi-robot measurements schedule is
   known a priori. In this latter method, the required cross-covariance
   terms are calculated using a fixed-lag centralized smoother. The
   comparison clearly shows the advantages of using the on-demand scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A second gradient continuum description developed, for example, by
   Germain, Toupin and Mindlin, and Eringen, gives rise to strain gradient
   plasticity, and is becoming a common coarse scale basis for multiscale
   homogenization of material response that respects the non-local nature
   of heterogeneous fine scale material response. Such homogenization
   approaches are developed to build either concurrent or hierarchical
   multiscale computational models for the second gradient response at the
   coarse scale that represent salient aspects of material response at the
   fine scale. Typically, the homogenization procedure consists of solving
   an initial boundary value problem for a statistical volume element of
   heterogeneous material at the fine scale and computing coarse scale
   stresses and strains using various volume averaging procedures. By
   enforcing a kinematically consistent description of the deformation
   field at each scale and asserting invariance of linear momentum with
   respect to scale of observation of a fixed set of mass particles,
   critical features of the boundary conditions and computation of
   homogenized stresses are revealed. In particular, an internal constraint
   on the higher-order fluctuation field is required to ensure
   orthogonality between that part of the fine scale deformation attributed
   to the second gradient and the part associated with higher-order
   fluctuations. Additionally, the body forces resulting from such internal
   constraints must be included in the computation of coarse scale stresses
   to respect scale invariance of linear momentum at each scale. Numerical
   implementation of fine scale fluctuation constraints employs linear
   constraint equations; the computation of coarse scale stresses is
   facilitated through a multiscale statement of principle of virtual
   velocities. Example fine scale simulations and associated coarse scale
   homogenization are presented to illustrate aspects of the boundary
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Since re-designing and re-optimizing existing logic, memory, and IP
   blocks in a 3D fashion significantly increases design cost, near-term
   three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) design will focus on
   reusing existing 2D blocks. One way to reuse 2D blocks in the 3D IC
   design is to first perform 3D floorplanning, insert signal
   through-silicon vias (TSVs) for 3D inter-block connections, and then
   route the blocks. In this paper, we propose algorithms (finding signal
   TSV locations, assigning TSVs to whitespace blocks, and manipulating
   whitespace blocks) for post-floorplanning signal TSV planning in the
   block-level 3D IC design. Experimental results show that our signal TSV
   planner outperforms the state-of-the-art TSV-aware 3D floorplanner by
   7\% to 38\% with respect to wirelength. In addition, our multiple TSV
   insertion algorithm outperforms a single TSV insertion algorithm by 27\%
   to 37\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an obstacle-aware clock tree synthesis method
   for through-silicon-via (TSV)-based 3D ICs. A unique aspect of this
   problem lies in the fact that various types of TSVs become obstacles
   during 3D clock routing including signal, power/ground, and clock TSVs.
   Some of these TSVs become placement obstacles, i.e., they interfere with
   clock buffers and clock TSVs; while other TSVs become routing obstacles,
   i.e., clock wires cannot route through them. Thus, the key is to perform
   TSV-induced obstacle-aware 3D clock routing under the following goals:
   (1) clock TSVs and clock buffers are located while avoiding overlap with
   placement obstacles; (2) clock wires are routed while avoiding routing
   obstacles; and (3) clock skew and slew constraints are satisfied.
   Related experiments show that our TSV-obstacle-aware clock tree does not
   sacrifice wirelength or clock power too much while avoiding various
   TSV-induced obstacles.}},

Abstract = {{In order to ensure the correctness of 3D ICs, they need to be tested
   both before and after their individual dies are bonded. All previous
   works in the area of 3D IC testing consider only stuck-at fault testing.
   However, 3D ICs also need to be tested for delay defects. In this work,
   we present a transition delay test infrastructure that can be used to
   test a 3D IC both before and after bonding. Furthermore, we present a
   methodology to test the through silicon vias (TSVs) after bonding,
   without necessitating regeneration of test patterns. Results show that
   the overhead involved is negligible. In addition, at-speed testing of
   circuits can suffer from large IR drop problems. In this paper, we also
   study the IR drop of 3D ICs during transition delay fault testing. We
   study how different configurations of probe pads affect the pre-bond IR
   drop. We also study how this IR drop changes from the pre-bond to the
   post-bond case.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) techniques have shown promise for sparse
   imaging applications such as ground penetrating radar (GPR). However, CS
   involves the enumeration of a dictionary which implies huge storage
   requirements when the problem is large and multidimensional. This paper
   shows that the underlying propagation model can have invariance
   properties that simplify the dictionary. Specifically, translational
   invariance in the GPR case leads to a block-Toeplitz structure that can
   be exploited to reduce both the storage, by a factor of N in each
   block-Toeplitz dimension, and the computational complexity. Exploiting
   this reduction in storage for the 3-dimensional GPR imaging problem
   makes the CS solution feasible for underground object detection.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanically handling of compliant bio-structures has been attracting
   growing attention due to the needs to automate processing of natural
   products. To understand the effect of bio-structural deformation on the
   blade location/force in poultry industry where high yield breast meats
   are harvested at production speed, biomaterial properties must be
   obtained before a nominal bio-structure model can be built for lumped
   parameter control of the process. This paper proposes a simple yet
   effective approach for obtaining the mechanical properties of
   biomaterials with a beam-like structure. A 3D curvature based beam model
   (CBM) with all its state variables described in global coordinates is
   developed for analyzing the large deformation of a compliant beam. The
   computationally efficient model without significantly scarifying
   accuracy has been verified numerically against a finite-element model.
   To illustrate its practicality, the CBM with cantilever constraints has
   been employed to analytically determine the nominal values of the
   elastic modulus and fracture strength from eight chicken-clavicle
   samples. While this paper is written in the context of wing manipulation
   for automatic de-boning process, the method can be used in other
   bioengineering applications involving flexible beam-like elements.}},

Abstract = {{As vehicular networks (a.k.a. VANETs) continue to mature, the benefits
   they promise come closer to reality. For this to happen, both security
   and privacy must be provided. Particularly in dense urban environments,
   novel methods of distributing the often changing identity (pseudonyms or
   PNs) of the vehicles is necessary in order to ensure vehicles have
   sufficient PNs. In this paper, we examine three methods of PN
   distribution through the use of ns-3 simulation. The specific
   measurements used are: (1) the average overall background data
   throughput, (2) average overall PNs distributed, (3) maximum number of
   PNs distributed, and (4) the distribution of the PNs across an array of
   vehicles in possession of varied numbers of PNs. We demonstrate that a
   strategy that intelligently limits to whom you distribute PNs in
   congested environments improves the overall data throughput and provides
   more PNs to those in need. This paper presents a method to implement
   this strategy.}},

Abstract = {{We report properties of marine aerosol and clouds measured in the
   shipping lanes between Monterey Bay and San Francisco off the coast of
   Central California. Using a suite of aerosol instrumentation onboard the
   CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft, these measurements represent a unique set of
   data contrasting the properties of clean and ship-impacted marine air
   masses in dry aerosol and cloud droplet residuals. Below-cloud aerosol
   exhibited average mass and number concentrations of 2 mu g m(-3) and 510
   cm(-3), respectively, which are consistent with previous studies
   performed off the coast of California. Enhancements in vanadium and
   cloud droplet number concentrations are observed concurrently with a
   decrease in cloud water pH, suggesting that periods of high aerosol
   loading are primarily linked to increased ship influence. Mass spectra
   from a compact time-of-flight Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer reveal
   an enhancement in the fraction of organic at m/z 42 (f(42)) and 99
   (f(99)) in ship-impacted clouds. These ions are well correlated to each
   other (R-2 > 0.64) both in and out of cloud and constitute 14\% (f(44))
   and 3\% (f(99)) of organic mass during periods of enhanced sulfate.
   High-resolution mass spectral analysis of these masses from ship
   measurements suggests that the ions responsible for this variation were
   oxidized, possibly due to cloud processing. We propose that the organic
   fractions of these ions be used as a metric for determining the extent
   to which cloud-processed ship emissions impact the marine atmosphere
   where (f(42) > 0.15; f(99) > 0.04) would imply heavy influence from
   shipping emissions, (0.05 < f(42) < 0.15; 0.01 < f(99) < 0.04) would
   imply moderate, but persistent, influences from ships, and (f(42) <
   0.05; f(99) < 0.01) would imply clean, non-ship-influenced air.}},

Abstract = {{Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the merged high
   resolution mass spectra of organic and inorganic aerosols from aerosol
   mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements to investigate the sources and
   evolution processes of submicron aerosols in New York City in summer
   2009. This new approach is able to study the distribution of organic and
   inorganic species in different types of aerosols, the acidity of organic
   aerosol (OA) factors, and the fragment ion patterns related to
   photochemical processing. In this study, PMF analysis of the unified AMS
   spectral matrix resolved 8 factors. The hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and
   cooking OA (COA) factors contain negligible amounts of inorganic
   species. The two factors that are primarily ammonium sulfate (SO4-OA)
   and ammonium nitrate (NO3-OA), respectively, are overall neutralized.
   Among all OA factors the organic fraction of SO4-OA shows the highest
   degree of oxidation (O/C=0.69). Two semi-volatile oxygenated OA (OOA)
   factors, i.e., a less oxidized (LO-OOA) and a more oxidized (MO-OOA),
   were also identified. MO-OOA represents local photochemical products
   with a diurnal profile exhibiting a pronounced noon peak, consistent
   with those of formaldehyde (HCHO) and O-x(=O-3 + NO2). The NO+/NO2+ ion
   ratio in MO-OOA is much higher than that in NO3-OA and in pure ammonium
   nitrate, indicating the formation of organic nitrates. The
   nitrogen-enriched OA (NOA) factor contains similar to 25\% of acidic
   inorganic salts, suggesting the formation of secondary OA via acid-base
   reactions of amines. The size distributions of OA factors derived from
   the size-resolved mass spectra show distinct diurnal evolving behaviors
   but overall a progressing evolution from smaller to larger particle mode
   as the oxidation degree of OA increases. Our results demonstrate that
   PMF analysis of the unified aerosol mass spectral matrix which contains
   both inorganic and organic aerosol signals may enable the deconvolution
   of more OA factors and gain more insights into the sources, processes,
   and chemical characteristics of OA in the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Testing of adaptive analog/RF systems is challenging as any test
   procedure must ensure that the system adapts correctly to external
   perturbations (process, workload) without incurring the excessive test
   time associated with iterative tuning procedures. This problem is made
   worse by the increased number of adaptation settings ({''}tuning knob
   values{''}) and the requirement of measuring specifications at all of
   these settings. In this paper, a new test technique is proposed that
   allows the closed loop performance of the adaptation procedure to be
   predicted from a set of open-loop tests. The optimal knob settings where
   the system should be tested in open-loop are found using a gradient
   based search algorithm and optimized test signals are generated such
   that the error in performance prediction across different tuning knob
   settings is minimized. The results of these tests are then mapped to the
   performance of the adaptive system which is validated implicitly without
   incurring large testing and tuning costs. Simulation results and
   hardware measurement results prove the validity of the proposed
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{3D integration technology can provide significant benefits of reduced
   interconnection delay and low power consumption in designing multi-core
   processors. However, the 3D integration technology magnifies the thermal
   challenges in multi-core processors due to high power density caused by
   stacking multiple layers vertically. For this reason, the 3D multi-core
   architecture cannot be practical without proper solutions to the thermal
   problems such as Dynamic Frequency Scaling(DFS). This paper investigates
   how the DFS handles the thermal problems in 3D multi-core processors
   from the perspective of the function-unit level. We also propose an
   adaptive DFS technique to mitigate the thermal problems in 3D multi-core
   processors by assigning different DFS levels to each core based on the
   corresponding cooling efficiency. Experimental results show that the
   proposed adaptive DFS technique reduces the peak temperature of 3D
   multi-core processors by up to 10.35 degrees C compared to the
   conventional DFS technique, leading to the improved reliability.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{1263-1273}},
Abstract = {{Mechanobiology to date has focused on differentiated cells or
   progenitors, yet the effects of mechanical forces on early
   differentiation of pluripotent stem cells are still largely unknown. To
   study the effects of cellular deformation, we utilize a fluid flow
   bioreactor to apply steady laminar shear stress to mouse embryonic stem
   cells (ESCs) cultured on a two dimensional surface. Shear stress was
   found to affect pluripotency, as well as germ specification to the
   mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal lineages, as indicated by gene
   expression of OCT4, T-BRACHY, AFP, and NES, respectively. The ectodermal
   and mesodermal response to shear stress was dependent on stress
   magnitude (ranging from 1.5 to 15 dynes cm(-2)). Furthermore, increasing
   the duration from one to four days resulted in a sustained increase in
   T-BRACHY and a marked suppression of AFP. These changes in
   differentiation occurred concurrently with the activation of Wnt and
   estrogen pathways, as determined by PCR arrays for signalling molecules.
   Together these studies show that the mechanical microenvironment may be
   an important regulator during early differentiation events, including
   gastrulation. This insight furthers understanding of normal and
   pathological events during development, as well as facilitates
   strategies for scale up production of stem cells for clinical therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Air quality impacts of volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen
   oxide (NOx) emissions from major sources over the northwestern United
   States are simulated. The comprehensive nested modeling system comprises
   three models: Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF), and Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions
   (SMOKE). In addition, the decoupled direct method in three dimensions
   (DDM-3D) is used to determine the sensitivities of pollutant
   concentrations to changes in precursor emissions during a severe smog
   episode in July of 2006. The average simulated 8-hr daily maximum O-3
   concentration is 48.9 ppb, with 1-hr O-3 maxima up to 106 ppb (40 km
   southeast of Seattle). The average simulated PM2.5 (particulate matter
   with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m) concentration at the measurement
   sites is 9.06 mu g m(-3), which is in good agreement with the observed
   concentration (8.06 mu g m(-3)). In urban areas (i.e., Seattle,
   Vancouver, etc.), the model predicts that, on average, a reduction of
   NOx emissions is simulated to lead to an increase in average 8-hr daily
   maximum O-3 concentrations, and will be most prominent in Seattle (where
   the greatest sensitivity is -0.2 ppb per\% change of mobile sources). On
   the other hand, decreasing NOx emissions is simulated to decrease the
   8-hr maximum O-3 concentrations in remote and forested areas. Decreased
   NOx emissions are simulated to slightly increase PM2.5 in major urban
   areas. In urban areas, a decrease in VOC emissions will result in a
   decrease of 8-hr maximum O-3 concentrations. The impact of decreased VOC
   emissions from biogenic, mobile, nonroad, and area sources on average
   8-hr daily maximum O-3 concentrations is up to 0.05 ppb decrease per \%
   of emission change, each. Decreased emissions of VOCs decrease average
   PM2.5 concentrations in the entire modeling domain. In major cities,
   PM2.5 concentrations are more sensitive to emissions of VOCs from
   biogenic sources than other sources of VOCs. These results can be used
   to interpret the effectiveness of VOC or NOx controls over pollutant
   concentrations, especially for localities that may exceed National
   Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2268}},
Pages = {{122-129}},
Abstract = {{Structural stability is one of the essential aspects of the construction
   of curved steel I-girder bridges. The AASHTO load and resistance factor
   design (LRFD) bridge design specifications require the consideration of
   stability-critical conditions during the construction of curved I-girder
   bridges through checking (a) nominal initial yielding due to combined
   major-axis bending and flange lateral bending, (b) strength under
   combined major-axis and flange lateral bending, and (c) web-bend
   buckling. These specifications limit the flange lateral bending stress
   to 0.6F(y). In some cases, these rules may not be sufficient unless
   global second-order amplification of the lateral-torsional response is
   considered. In particular, structures with narrow widths and long spans
   may be susceptible to large second-order amplification that could
   compromise the overall system constructability. This paper presents
   analytical studies of a slender curved and skewed I-girder bridge unit
   that exhibited difficulties during the placement of the concrete deck.
   The results of approximate one- and two-dimensional analyses of the
   construction phase are compared with refined three-dimensional finite
   element solutions to highlight their differences. Guidelines are
   provided for handling cases in which the slender geometry of the
   structure may be an important constructability consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Buildability is increasingly becoming a major requirement in building
   construction practice. The aim of buildability is to improve efficiency
   of the overall building process by developing construction sensitive
   designs. The objective of this study is to develop a model to assess the
   buildability of the buildings within Malaysian construction projects. To
   achieve the objective of this study, a structured interview with an
   expert panel, including 30 construction professionals, was conducted to
   compare the common buildability attributes with common construction
   systems for building structure in Malaysia using analytical hierarchy
   process (AHP). The proposed model to assess the buildability of the
   construction buildings was evaluated and the model was amended to
   fulfill the requirements of the construction industry in Malaysia.
   Results of this study are useful to evaluate the design of the buildings
   within Malaysian construction projects, thus saving time, cost, and
   enhancing quality.}},

Abstract = {{We develop optimal respiratory airflow patterns using a nonlinear

   classical calculus of variations minimization techniques to derive an
   optimal airflow pattern for inspiratory and expiratory breathing cycles.
   The physiological interpretation of the optimality criteria used
   involves the minimization of work of breathing and lung volume
   acceleration for the inspiratory phase, and theminimization of the
   elastic potential energy and rapid airflow rate changes for the

Abstract = {{We analyze summertime photochemistry near the surface in Beijing, China,
   using a 1-D photochemical model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model,
   REAM-1D) constrained by in situ observations, focusing on the budgets of
   ROx (OH + HO2 + RO2) radicals and O-3 formation. While the modeling
   analysis focuses on near-surface photochemical budgets, the implications
   for the budget of O-3 in the planetary boundary layer are also
   discussed. In terms of daytime average, the total ROx primary production
   rate near the surface in Beijing is 6.6 ppbv per hour (ppbv h(-1), among
   the highest found in urban atmospheres. The largest primary ROx source
   in Beijing is photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds
   (OVOCs), which produces HO2 and RO2 at 2.5 ppbv h(-1) and 1.7 ppbv
   h(-1), respectively. Photolysis of excess HONO from an unknown
   heterogeneous source is the predominant primary OH source at 2.2 ppbv
   h(-1), much larger than that of (OD)-D-1 + H2O (0.4 ppbv h(-1)). The
   largest ROx sink is via OH + NO2 reaction (1.6 ppbv h(-1)), followed by
   formation of RO2NO2 (1.0 ppbv h(-1)) and RONO2 (0.7 ppbv h(-1)). Due to
   the large aerosol surface area, aerosol uptake of HO2 appears to be
   another important radical sink, although the estimate of its magnitude
   is highly variable depending on the uptake coefficient value used. The
   daytime average O-3 production and loss rates near the surface are 32
   ppbv h(-1) and 6.2 ppbv h(-1), respectively. Assuming NO2 to be the
   source of excess HONO, the NO2 to HONO trans-formation leads to
   considerable O-3 loss and reduction of its lifetime. Our
   observation-constrained modeling analysis suggests that oxidation of
   VOCs (especially aromatics) and heterogeneous reactions (e. g. HONO
   formation and aerosol uptake HO2) play potentially critical roles in the
   primary radical budget and O-3 formation in Beijing. One important
   ramification is that O-3 production is neither NOx nor VOC limited, but
   in a transition regime where reduction of either NOx or VOCs could
   result in reduction of O-3 production. The transition regime implies
   more flexibility in the O-3 control strategies than a binary system of
   either NOx or VOC limited regime. The co-benefit of concurrent reduction
   of both NOx and VOCs in reducing column O-3 production integrated in the
   planetary boundary layer is significant. Further research on the spatial
   extent of the transition regime over the polluted eastern China is
   critically important for controlling regional O-3 pollution.}},

Title = {{Preclinical Evaluation of Ice-Free Cryopreserved Arteries: Structural

Abstract = {{Objective: Arterial allografts are routinely employed for reconstruction
   of infected prosthetic grafts. Usually, banked cryopreserved arteries
   are used; however, existing conventional freezing cryopreservation
   techniques applied to arteries are expensive. In contrast, a new
   ice-free cryopreservation technique results in processing, storage and
   shipping methods that are technically simpler and potentially less
   costly. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not
   ice-free cryopreservation causes tissue changes that might preclude
   clinical use. Methods: Conventionally frozen cryopreserved porcine
   arteries were compared with ice-free cryopreserved arteries and
   untreated fresh controls using morphological (light, scanning electron
   and laser scanning microscopy), viability (alamarBlue assay) and
   hemocompatibility methods (blood cell adhesion,
   thrombin/antithrombin-III-complex, polymorphonuclear
   neutrophil-elastase, beta-thromboglobulin and terminal complement
   complex SC5b-9). Results: No statistically significant structural or
   hemocompatibility differences between ice-free cryopreserved and frozen
   tissues were detectable. There were no quantitative differences observed
   for either autofluorescence (elastin) or second harmonic generation
   (collagen) measured by laser scanning microscopy. Cell viability in
   ice-free cryopreserved arteries was significantly reduced compared to
   fresh and frozen tissues (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The formation of ice
   in aortic artery preservation did not make a difference in histology,
   structure or thrombogenicity, but significantly increased viability
   compared with a preservation method that precludes ice formation.
   Reduced cell viability should not reduce in vivo performance. Therefore,
   ice-free cryopreservation is a potentially safe and cost-effective
   technique for the cryopreservation of blood vessel allografts. Copyright

Abstract = {{This article considers systems that degrade gradually and whose
   degradation can be monitored using sensor technology. Different
   degradation modeling techniques, such as the Brownian motion process,
   gamma process, and random coefficients models, have been used to model
   the evolution of sensor-based degradation signals with the goal of
   estimating lifetime distributions of various engineering systems. A
   parametric stochastic degradation modeling approach to estimate the
   Residual Life Distributions (RLDs) of systems/components that are
   operating in the field is presented. The proposed methodology rests on
   the idea of utilizing in situ degradations signals, communicated from
   fielded components, to update their respective RLDs in real time. Given
   the observed partial degradation signals, RLDs are evaluated based on a
   first-passage time approach. Expressions for the first-passage time for
   a base case linear degradation model, in which the degradation signal
   evolves as a Brownian motion, are derived. The model is tested using
   simulated and real-world degradation signals from a rotating machinery
   application.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{This study focused on exploring the feasibility of green composites made
   from biodegradable and renewable materials as potential alternatives to
   petroleum polymer composites and understanding the reinforcing
   mechanisms in composites containing kenaf fibers (KF). KF-reinforced
   poly(lactide) acid (PLA) composites were made using melt compounding and
   injection molding, and their properties were compared to that of
   KF-reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. The flexural properties and
   thermomechanical behavior were determined as a function of the fiber
   content, the crystallization of PLA and PP was studied using X-ray
   diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, and the composites'
   morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. It was
   concluded that PLA exhibits higher modulus and Tg compared to those of
   neat PP. The modulus of the composites at 40 wt\% fibers is 6.64 GPa and
   2.96 GPa for PLA and PP, respectively. In general, addition of kenaf
   results in larger property enhancement in PP due to better wetting of
   the fibers by the low melt viscosity PP and the crystallization behavior
   of PP that is significantly altered by the fibers. The novelty of this
   work is that it provides one-to-one comparison of PLA and PP composites,
   and it explores the feasibility of fabricating green composites with
   enhanced properties using a simple scalable process.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines how bus design factors influence door crowding and

   factors, including door placement, aisle length, presence of a front

   associated with longer marginal boarding times and an increased number
   of unsafe boarding and alighting movements that occur when the bus has

   providing intensive properties of textile fabrics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},

Volume = {{103}},

Pages = {{952-959}},
Abstract = {{Traditional wicking tests provide information that is specific to the
   test fluid, apparatus, and conditions. As a result, this information
   cannot be used to make predictions about wicking rates beyond the
   respective test parameters. In contrast, a new
   upward-horizontal-downward (UHD) wicking test has been presented that
   provides intensive properties of fabrics in the form of permeability (k)
   and effective capillary radius (R-c) as functions of saturation (S). The
   UHD test was developed using water as the test fluid. If the k-S-R-c
   relationships are truly intrinsic to a given fabric, then they should
   not depend on the test fluid. Here, we conducted the UHD test on a knit
   fabric using three different test fluids characterized by different
   surface tensions, densities, and viscosities: dodecane, tetradecane, and
   hexadecane. All fluids fall on the same k vs. S and k vs. R-c curves,
   proving that these curves are intrinsic characteristics of the fabric.
   We then used the k-S-R-c properties to successfully predict the in-plane
   horizontal and downward wicking rates of two different fluids, octanol
   and water, in the fabric. These results validate the UHD wicking test as
   a method for providing intensive properties of textile fabrics which can
   then be used for predicting wicking rates.}},

   CENTERLESS GRINDING}},
Journal = {{MACHINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{355-379}},
Abstract = {{Centerless grinding is an abrasive machining process commonly used in
   the aerospace and automotive industries for shaping axisymmetric
   components that require a high dimensional accuracy and a smooth surface
   finish. For this high volume manufacturing operation, process parameters
   have historically been selected conservatively using machining data
   handbooks or on a trial-and-error basis according to operator experience
   without explicit consideration of how the selected settings affect the
   productivity or cost of the operation. To improve operation efficiency,
   a science-based approach for selecting the optimum process parameters
   must be developed to replace traditional industrial practices. In this
   article, a methodology combining several analytical and experimental
   techniques is presented for optimizing the key process parameters in
   plunge centerless grinding of Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V superalloy
   fasteners in two phases: (i) modeling of process constraints using
   experimental design and statistical regression, and (ii) determination
   of optimum grinding conditions in the feasible operating region using a
   simulation algorithm based on classical machining economics theory. The
   results show that the implementation of optimum material removal rates
   can lead to an appreciable reduction in the cost of the operation while
   satisfying the constraints imposed on the machine tool and the workpiece
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{We report on reversible changes of the work function (WF) values of
   indium-tin-oxide (ITO) under prolonged ultraviolet (UV) and air
   exposure. The WF of ITO is reduced from 4.7 eV to 4.2 eV by photon
   absorption in ITO under UV illumination or an air mass 1.5 solar
   simulator (100 mW cm(-2)). Air or oxygen exposure is found to increase
   the WF of ITO (UV-exposed) to a value of 4.6 eV. These changes of ITO's
   WF lead to reversible variations of the performance of organic
   photovoltaic devices where ITO acts primarily as the electron collecting
   or hole collecting electrode. These variations can be reflected in the
   disappearance (or appearance) of an S-shaped kink in the J-V
   characteristics upon continuous UV or solar simulator illumination (or
   air exposure). This reversible phenomenon is ascribed to the adsorption
   and desorption of oxygen on the surface and grain boundaries of ITO. The
   use of surface modifiers to either decrease or increase the WF of ITO in
   organic photovoltaic devices with inverted and conventional geometries
   is also shown to be an effective route to stabilize the device
   performance under UV illumination.}},

Abstract = {{We use computational modeling to design a self-propelling micro-swimmer
   that can navigate in a low-Reynolds-number environment. Our simple
   swimmer consists of a responsive gel body with two propulsive flaps
   attached to its opposite sides and a stimuli-sensitive steering flap at
   the swimmer front end. The responsive gel body undergoes periodic
   expansions and contractions leading to a time-irreversible beating
   motion of the propulsive flaps, which propels the micro-swimmer. We
   examine the effects of body elasticity and flap geometry on the
   locomotion of the swimmer and show how they can be tailored to optimize
   the swimmer propulsion. We also probe how the swimmer trajectory can be
   controllably changed using the steering flap that bends when exposed to
   an external stimulus. We demonstrate that the steering occurs due to two
   effects: steering flap bending and periodic beating. Furthermore, our
   simulations reveal that the turning direction can be regulated by
   changing the stimulus strength.}},

   fluids with the same viscosity but different additive and base stock
   compositions. Analysis includes measurement of frictional behavior,
   thermophysical and rheological properties, and mechanical efficiency in
   three different hydraulic motors. Trends were analyzed and correlations
   between the various fluid properties were identified. The results
   illustrate the importance of operation-specific fluid formulation and

   boiling. These nanostructures enhance boiling due to capillary wicking
   induced by their high surface area-to-volume ratio. Despite only having
   a thickness of 3-4 mu m, similar to 58\% improvement in critical heat
   flux (CHF) was obtained by the addition of CuO nanostructures to both a
   smooth surface and a microgrooved surface. Because the CuO
   nanostructures are processed at room temperature, they can be easily
   combined with microfabricated cavities for additional boiling

Abstract = {{Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides (PDI) have been linked to
   norbornene through either an imide or a ``bay'' position. These
   PDI-functionalised norbornenes are readily polymerised using a ruthenium
   ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) initiator. In one case the
   polymerisation is shown to be well controlled with a linear dependence
   of molecular weight on the monomer/initiator ratio. For the polymers
   with PDI-norbornene linkages through the imide nitrogen, UV-vis
   spectroscopy suggests significant PDI aggregation both in dilute
   solution and the solid state, a powder X-ray diffraction peak
   attributable to pi-stacking is seen, and weak n-channel field-effect
   transistor behavior (electron mobilities <5 x 10(-5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1))
   was observed. In contrast, the ``bay''-linked polymer shows essentially
   monomer-like UV-vis spectra in both solution and the solid state, no
   X-ray evidence for pi-stacking, and no measurable transistor behaviour.
   The polymers were used as acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells
   in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene): low power conversion
   efficiencies (<= 0.38\%) were obtained, largely due to low short-circuit
   currents, again with the ``bay''-linked polymer giving the poorest
   performance.}},

   reconstruction of the wave form of oceanic sea states via a variational
   stereo method. In the context of active surfaces, the shape and radiance
   of the wave surface are obtained as minimizers of an energy functional
   that combines image observations and smoothness priors. To obey the
   quasi Gaussianity of oceanic waves observed in nature, a given
   statistical wave law is enforced in the stereo variational framework as
   a weak constraint. Multigrid methods are then used to solve the partial
   differential equations derived from the optimality conditions of the
   augmented energy functional. An application of the developed method to
   two sets of experimental stereo data is finally presented.}},

Abstract = {{Macroscopic delamination of polymer-metal interfaces is one of the main
   failure modes observed in micro-electronic components. Due to the
   irregularly shaped metal roughness profile, this delamination not only
   consists of interface separation but also bulk cracking at the
   micro-scale of the roughness. In fact, one of the key mechanisms that
   results in increased adhesion toughness at roughened interfaces is the
   transition from adhesive to cohesive failure. A semi-analytical approach
   is discussed in which the competition between adhesive and cohesive
   cracking is analyzed by means of the theoretical relation between
   interface and kinking stress intensity factors. The parameters that
   define this relation, the solution coefficients, are quantified by
   finite element (FE) simulations. Accordingly, the crack kinking location
   and kinking angle into the softer polymer is readily calculated.
   Furthermore, the geometrical effect of roughness is evaluated by means
   of FE simulations in which the interface topology follows from measured
   roughness profiles while also including interface delamination using
   cohesive zone elements.}},

Abstract = {{A series of simulations with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5
   (CAM5) with a 7-mode Modal Aerosol Model were conducted to assess the
   changes in cloud microphysical properties and radiative forcing
   resulting from marine organic aerosols. Model simulations show that the
   anthropogenic aerosol indirect forcing (AIF) predicted by CAM5 is
   decreased in absolute magnitude by up to 0.09 W m(-2) (7\%) when marine
   organic aerosols are included. Changes in the AIF from marine organic
   aerosols are associated with small global increases in low-level
   in-cloud droplet number concentration and liquid water path of 1.3
   cm(-3) (1.5\%) and 0.22 g m(-2) (0.5\%), respectively. Areas especially
   sensitive to changes in cloud properties due to marine organic aerosol
   include the Southern Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and North Atlantic
   Ocean, all of which are characterized by high marine organic emission
   rates. As climate models are particularly sensitive to the background
   aerosol concentration, this small but non-negligible change in the AIF
   due to marine organic aerosols provides a notable link for
   ocean-ecosystem marine low-level cloud interactions and may be a
   candidate for consideration in future earth system models.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the southeastern US is investigated
   by analyzing the spatial-temporal distribution of water-soluble organic
   carbon (WSOC) and other PM2.5 components from 900 archived 24-h Teflon
   filters collected at 15 urban or rural EPA Federal Reference Method
   (FRM) network sites throughout 2007. Online measurements of WSOC at an
   urban/rural-paired site in Georgia in the summer of 2008 are contrasted
   to the filter data. Based on FRM filters, excluding biomass-burning
   events (levoglucosan < 50 ng m(-3)), WSOC and sulfate were highly
   correlated with PM2.5 mass (r(2)similar to 0.7). Both components
   comprised a large mass fraction of PM2.5 (13\% and 31\%, respectively,
   or similar to 25\% and 50\% for WSOM and ammonium sulfate). Sulfate and
   WSOC both tracked ambient temperature throughout the year, suggesting
   the temperature effects were mainly linked to faster photochemistry
   and/or synoptic meteorology and less due to enhanced biogenic
   hydrocarbon emissions. FRM WSOC, and to a lesser extent sulfate, were
   spatially homogeneous throughout the region, yet WSOC was moderately
   enhanced (27\%) in locations of greater predicted isoprene emissions in
   summer. A Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis identified two
   major source types for the summer WSOC; 22\% of the WSOC were associated
   with ammonium sulfate, and 56\% of the WSOC were associated with brown
   carbon and oxalate. A small urban excess of FRM WSOC (10\%) was observed
   in the summer of 2007, however, comparisons of online WSOC measurements
   at one urban/rural pair (Atlanta/Yorkville) in August 2008 showed
   substantially greater difference in WSOC (31\%) relative to the FRM
   data, suggesting a low bias for urban filters. The measured Atlanta
   urban excess, combined with the estimated boundary layer heights, gave
   an estimated Atlanta daily WSOC production rate in August of 0.55 mgC
   m(-2) h(-1) between mid-morning and mid-afternoon. This study
   characterizes the regional nature of fine particles in the southeastern
   US, confirming the importance of SOA and the roles of both biogenic and
   anthropogenic emissions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel procedure has been developed to retrieve, simultaneously, the
   optical, microphysical and chemical properties of tropospheric aerosols
   with a multi-wavelength Raman lidar system in the troposphere over an
   urban site (Athens, Greece: 37.9A degrees N, 23.6A degrees E, 200 m
   a.s.l.) using data obtained during the European Space Agency (ESA)
   THERMOPOLIS project, which took place between 15-31 July 2009 over the
   Greater Athens Area (GAA). We selected to apply our procedure for a case
   study of intense aerosol layers that occurred on 20-21 July 2009. The
   National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) EOLE 6-wavelength Raman
   lidar system has been used to provide the vertical profiles of the
   optical properties of aerosols (extinction and backscatter coefficients,
   lidar ratio) and the water vapor mixing ratio. An inversion algorithm
   was used to derive the mean aerosol microphysical properties (mean
   effective radius (r(eff)), single-scattering albedo omega) and mean
   complex refractive index (m)) at selected heights in the 2-3 km height
   region. We found that r(eff) was 0.14-0.4 (+/- 0.14) mu m, omega was
   0.63-0.88 (+/- 0.08) (at 532 nm) and m ranged from 1.44 (+/- 0.10) +
   0.01 (+/- 0.01)i to 1.55 (+/- 0.12) + 0.06 (+/- 0.02)i, in good
   agreement (only for the r(eff) values) with in situ aircraft
   measurements. The water vapor and temperature profiles were incorporated
   into the ISORROPIA II model to propose a possible in situ aerosol
   composition consistent with the retrieved m and omega values. The
   retrieved aerosol chemical composition in the 2-3 km height region gave
   a variable range of sulfate (0-60\%) and organic carbon (OC) content
   (0-50\%), although the OC content increased (up to 50\%) and the sulfate
   content dropped (up to 30\%) around 3 km height; the retrieved low omega
   value (0.63), indicates the presence of absorbing biomass burning smoke
   mixed with urban haze. Finally, the retrieved aerosol microphysical
   properties were compared with column-integrated sun photometer CIMEL
   data.}},

   (FSATs) enabling directional guided wave (GW) inspection of plate-like

   which acts as a spatial filter on the propagating wave field thanks to
   its shape. In sensing operation, FSAT differential output exhibits a
   dominant spectral component uniquely associated with the incoming wave
   direction. A single signal thus provides 2D imaging capabilities, as

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided wave methods are being widely explored for inspection
   of large structural areas using a sparse array of surface-mounted
   transducers. However, structural health monitoring (SHM) with guided
   waves can be problematic because variable operational conditions can
   significantly affect the measured ultrasonic signals. Although
   homogeneous temperature variations have been well-researched and
   successful compensation algorithms developed, few studies have
   considered distributed surface wetting. This paper reports results from
   an experimental investigation of the effects of surface wetting on
   guided wave signals recorded from a spatially distributed array affixed
   to a stiffened aluminum plate. Droplets of water were applied to the
   plate in a random and increasing manner until almost forty percent of
   the plate was wet, and the percent surface area covered at each
   increment of wetting was independently measured via digital photographs
   of the plate surface. Ultrasonic guided wave signals resulting from a
   broadband chirp excitation were recorded from all transducer pairs in
   between increments of wetting. Root mean squared errors as compared to
   the dry plate are calculated from these signals at multiple frequencies
   to investigate the efficacy of quantifying the degree of surface
   wetting. This study is a first step in the process of assessing and
   addressing the effects of distributed surface wetting on the performance
   of a guided wave SHM system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of three-dimensional wave scattering by
   an elastic inclusion with quadratic nonlinearity in an otherwise linear
   elastic medium. Due to the nonlinearity of the inclusion, second order
   wave appears in the scattered field. Under the incidence of a plane
   longitudinal wave, solution to the scattered second order field is
   derived explicitly in terms of the Green's function. A far field
   approximation of the scattered field is also obtained. The results of
   far field show that the scattered second harmonic field consists of a
   longitudinal spherical wave and a shear spherical wave. Furthermore, it
   is found that the amplitude of the forward scattered field is
   proportional to the acoustic nonlinearity parameter beta averaged over
   the volume of the inclusion, and the amplitude of backscattered field is
   proportional to a spatially weighted average of beta. Finally, a method
   is described to nondestructively obtain the statistics of the spatial
   variation of beta over the inclusion such as the mean, the variance and
   autocorrelation length.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure the long and safe operation of power plants, structural parts
   must be monitored for damage. In the case of welded steel pipes that
   maintain high pressures in high temperature environments, a common cause
   of failure is creep damage. Severe creep damage often occurs in the heat
   affected zone (HAZ). Previous research has shown that nonlinear acoustic
   techniques are sensitive to creep damage. This research develops a
   procedure using longitudinal waves to obtain the nonlinearity parameter
   on a welded steel pipe in order to detect creep damage. These
   experiments show higher levels of nonlinearity in the HAZ. Additional
   measurements on an undamaged, welded sample suggest that the high
   nonlinearity is due to creep (stresses at a high temperature for
   extended time) damage and not welding (high temperature only for a short

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided waves offer the promise of fast and reliable methods
   for interrogating large, plate-like structures. Distributed arrays of
   permanently attached, inexpensive piezoelectric transducers have thus
   been proposed as a cost-effective means to excite and measure ultrasonic
   guided waves for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. Guided
   wave data recorded from a distributed array of transducers are often
   analyzed and interpreted through the use of guided wave imaging
   algorithms, such as conventional delay-and-sum imaging or the more
   recently applied minimum variance imaging. Both imaging algorithms
   perform reasonably well using signal envelopes, but can exhibit
   significant performance improvements when phase information is used.
   However, the use of phase information inherently requires knowledge of
   the dispersion relations, which are often not known to a sufficient
   degree of accuracy for high quality imaging since they are very
   sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, pressure, and
   loading. This work seeks to perform improved imaging with phase
   information by leveraging adaptive dispersion estimates obtained from in
   situ measurements. Experimentally obtained data from a distributed array
   is used to validate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided waves are frequently applied for structural health
   monitoring and nondestructive evaluation of plate-like metallic and
   composite structures. Spatially distributed arrays of fixed
   piezoelectric transducers can be used to detect damage by recording and
   analyzing all pairwise signal combinations. By subtracting pre-recorded
   baseline signals, the effects due to scatterer interactions can be
   isolated. Given these residual signals, techniques such as delay-andsum
   imaging are capable of detecting flaws, but do not exploit the expected
   sparse nature of damage. It is desired to determine the location of a
   possible flaw by leveraging the anticipated sparsity of damage; i.e.,
   most of the structure is assumed to be damage-free. Unlike least-
   squares methods, L1-norm minimization techniques favor sparse solutions
   to inverse problems such as the one considered here of locating damage.
   Using this type of method, it is possible to exploit sparsity of damage
   by formulating the imaging process as an optimization problem. A
   model-based damage localization method is presented that simultaneously
   decomposes all scattered signals into location-based signal components.
   The method is first applied to simulated data to investigate sensitivity
   to both model mismatch and additive noise, and then to experimental data
   recorded from an aluminum plate with artificial damage. Compared to
   delay-and-sum imaging, results exhibit a significant reduction in both
   spot size and imaging artifacts when the model is reasonably
   well-matched to the data.}},

Abstract = {{The application of ultrasonic guided wave methods to both nondestructive
   evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) is becoming more
   prevalent as techniques to handle their multi-modal and dispersive
   nature are developed. There are several applications where it would be
   not only convenient but perhaps essential to interpolate arrays of
   measured guided wave signals. One application is that of linear spatial
   arrays acting as receivers, where it may be useful to interpolate
   signals in between array elements. Another application is interpolation
   of signals acquired as a function of a non-spatial variable such as
   temperature or applied load; this situation arises in SHM applications
   where it is desired to construct a baseline that is well-matched to the
   signal of interest. This problem is closely related to that of time
   domain up-sampling whereby signals are resampled at a higher rate, which
   can readily be performed using sinc interpolation when the Nyquist
   criterion is satisfied. In the spatial domain, there is an analogous
   spatial Nyquist criterion, and if it is satisfied, spatial signals can
   be similarly up-sampled. In this paper we derive a Nyquist criterion for
   sinc interpolation in the temperature domain. Examples are shown of
   sinc, linear and spline interpolation algorithms, and the efficacy of
   each is evaluated on both simulated and experimental data. Concluding
   remarks are made regarding both the usefulness and limitations of guided
   wave signal interpolation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to measure and quantify the polarization of ultrasonic waves
   has led to the development of novel non-destructive diagnostic tools,
   which rely on the sensitivity of polarization to surface roughness,
   cracks, temperature and residual stresses, among others. In particular,
   the following paper provides an analytical description of polarized Lamb
   wave components that yield an elliptical, rotated profile of the
   particle trajectory. The formulation includes Lamb waves generated by a
   circular piezoelectric disc, along with descriptions of bi-modal and
   single mode polarization characteristics. A technique is proposed that
   utilizes the elliptical orientation as a damage identification parameter
   for guided wave structural interrogation techniques. The technique is
   applied to finite element models of aluminum and composite armor-like
   structures. This analytical formulation is compared to experimental Lamb
   wave polarization results, where polarized Lamb wave components are
   extracted from complex, homogenous aluminum specimens using a 3D
   Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry setup. The experimental results show
   that the proposed technique allows for improved damage characterization.}},

Abstract = {{This research experimentally investigates second harmonic generation of
   Rayleigh waves propagating through carbon steel samples damaged in a
   stress corrosion environment. Damage from stress corrosion cracking is
   of major concern in nuclear reactor tubes and in gas and fuel transport
   pipelines. For example, certain types of stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
   account for more failures in steam generator tubes than most other
   damage mechanisms, yet these cracks do not initiate until late in the
   structure's life. Thus, there is a need to be able to measure the damage
   state prior to crack initiation, and it has been shown that the acoustic
   nonlinearity parameter - the parameter associated with second harmonic
   generation - is sensitive to microstructural evolution. In this work,
   samples are immersed in a sodium carbonate-bicarbonate solution, which
   typically forms in the soil surrounding buried pipelines affected by
   SCC, and held at yield stress for 5-15 days to the onset of stress
   corrosion cracking. Measurements of second harmonic generation with
   Rayleigh waves are taken intermittently to relate cumulative damage
   prior to macroscopic cracking to nonlinear wave propagation.
   Experimental results showing changes in second harmonic generation due
   to stress corrosion damage are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Cracking in concrete structures is problematic because these cracks can
   significantly influence the stability of a concrete structure and
   compromise its durability. The first step to evaluate the serviceability
   of an in-field concrete structure is to have accurate information on
   existing crack depth. It is thus of paramount importance to be able to
   accurately determine the depth of cracks in these concrete structures.
   This research employs a diffusive ultrasonic technique to measure the
   depth of surface cracks in concrete. Ultrasonic measurements on a 25.4 x
   33 x 60.96 cm(3) concrete block containing an artificial crack with
   varying depths from 2.54 to 10.16 cm are conducted. Contact transducers
   with one transmitting and the other receiving the ultrasonic signals are
   mounted on the concrete surface on opposite sides of the crack. A pulse
   signal with the duration of 2 mu s is transmitted. In this frequency
   regime, wavelengths are sufficiently short (comparable with the
   aggregate size) so that a diffuse ultrasonic signal is detected. The
   arrival of the diffuse ultrasonic energy at the receiver is delayed by
   the existence of the crack. This lag-time and the diffusivity of the
   concrete sample are measured, and a finite element model is employed to
   solve the inverse problem to determine the crack depth from these
   measured diffuse ultrasonic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This research simulates the measurements of crack depth in concrete
   using diffuse ultrasound. The finite element method is employed to
   simulate the ultrasonic diffusion process around cracks with different
   geometrical shapes, with the goal of gaining physical insight into the
   data obtained from experimental measurements. The commercial finite
   element software Ansys is used to implement the two-dimensional concrete
   model. The model is validated with an analytical solution and
   experimental results. It is found from the simulation results that
   preliminary knowledge of the crack geometry is required to interpret the
   energy evolution curves from measurements and to correctly determine the

Abstract = {{Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a deleterious reaction in concrete.
   Significant ASR damage could undermine the durability of concrete
   structures and may result in reduced service life. Several
   nondestructive techniques based on ultrasound have been used to assess
   ASR damage. It has been shown that nonlinear ultrasound is more
   sensitive to internal stresses as well as to micro-cracks induced by ASR
   damage. In this investigation, we developed a co-linear wave mixing
   method for assessing ASR damage in concrete. By mixing two longitudinal
   waves, a new longitudinal wave with a lower frequency is generated. The
   amplitude of this new wave is proportional to the acoustic nonlinear
   parameter beta which can then be obtained from the frequency spectrum of
   the newly generated longitudinal wave. Our experimental results show
   that (i) the acoustic nonlinearity parameter is closely correlated to
   ASR damage in concrete, (ii) the nonlinear wave mixing technique
   developed here is capable of measuring the changes in the acoustic
   nonlinearity parameter caused by ASR damage, even in its early stages,
   and (iii) the nonlinear wave mixing method has the potential to identify
   the different stages of ASR damage and to track the intrinsic
   characteristics of the ASR damage.}},

Abstract = {{Guided waves propagating in a homogeneous plate are known to be
   sensitive to both temperature changes and applied stress variations.
   Here we consider the inverse problem of recovering homogeneous biaxial
   stresses from measured changes in phase velocity at multiple propagation
   directions using a single mode at a specific frequency. Although there
   is no closed form solution relating phase velocity changes to applied
   stresses, prior results indicate that phase velocity changes can be
   closely approximated by a sinusoidal function with respect to angle of
   propagation. Here it is shown that all sinusoidal coefficients can be
   estimated from a single uniaxial loading experiment. The general biaxial
   inverse problem can thus be solved by fitting an appropriate sinusoid to
   measured phase velocity changes versus propagation angle, and relating
   the coefficients to the unknown stresses. The phase velocity data are
   obtained from direct arrivals between guided wave transducers whose
   direct paths of propagation are oriented at different angles. This
   method is applied and verified using sparse array data recorded during a
   fatigue test. The additional complication of the resulting fatigue
   cracks interfering with some of the direct arrivals is addressed via
   proper selection of transducer pairs. Results show that applied stresses
   can be successfully recovered from the measured changes in guided wave
   signals.}},

Abstract = {{Detection and localization of fatigue cracks is an important application
   for inspection and monitoring of civil, mechanical and aerospace
   structures, but assessment of such damage via ultrasonic guided waves
   can be problematic when cracks are tightly closed in the absence of
   applied tensile loads. Proposed here are load-differential methods,
   which compare signals at one load to those at another load at the same
   damage state. The main advantage of such methods is that cracks can be
   detected and localized by analyzing current signals obtained from
   different loading conditions without using baseline data from the
   damage-free state. The efficacy of the proposed load-differential
   imaging method is examined using fatigue test data where multiple cracks
   grow from a single through-hole. Data were acquired with a spatially
   distributed array of piezoelectric discs by recording ultrasonic signals
   as a function of applied uniaxial load at intervals throughout the
   fatigue test. Load-differential guided wave images are generated from
   residual signals via delay-and-sum imaging methods, and these images are
   evaluated in terms of their ability to detect and localize fatigue
   cracks.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave structural health monitoring (SHM) is being considered to
   assess the integrity of plate-like structures for many applications.
   Prior research has investigated how guided wave propagation is affected
   by applied loads, which induce anisotropic changes in both dimensions
   and phase velocity. In addition, it is well-known that applied tensile
   loads open fatigue cracks and thus enhance their detectability using
   ultrasonic methods. Here we describe load-differential methods in which
   signals recorded from different loads at the same damage state are
   compared without using previously obtained damage-free data. Changes in
   delay-and-sum images are considered as a function of differential loads
   and damage state. Load-differential features are extracted from these
   images that capture the effects of loading as fatigue cracks are opened.
   Damage detection thresholds are adaptively set based upon the
   load-differential behavior of the various features, which enables
   implementation of an automated fatigue crack detection process. The
   efficacy of the proposed approach is examined using data from a fatigue
   test performed on an aluminum plate specimen that is instrumented with a
   sparse array of surface-mounted ultrasonic guided wave transducers.}},

Abstract = {{Orthorhombic, alpha- phase, Sb2O4 nanowire was fabricated by heating
   Sb2S3 powder. At 500 degrees C, the grown product had the morphology of
   nanowire with an average diameter of similar to 100 nm. At 600 degrees
   C, it became a continuous film with nodular morphology. The structure,
   crystallinity, and phase-purity of the nanowire were investigated using
   X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy, and selected-area electron diffraction. These measurements,
   combined with those obtained using X-ray photoelectron, Raman, and
   photoluminescence spectroscopy, indicate that the as-grown nanowires
   were crystalline with an orthorhombic alpha-Sb2O4 structure. This study
   confirmed that thermal evaporation of the Sb2S3 precursor is a viable

Abstract = {{Internal stress in polycrystalline materials is an intrinsic attribute
   of the microstructure that affects a broad range of material properties.
   It is usually acquired through experiment in conjunction with continuum
   mechanics modelling, but its determination at nanometre and submicron
   scales is extremely difficult. Here, we report a bottom-up approach
   using atomistic calculation. We obtain the internal stress in
   polycrystalline copper with nanosized grains by first computing the
   stress associated with each atom and then sorting the stress into those
   associated with different self-equilibrating length scales, i.e. sample
   scale and grain cell, which gives type I, II and III residual stresses,
   respectively. The result shows highly non-uniform internal stress
   distribution; the internal stress depends sensitively on grain size and
   the grain shape anisotropy. Statistical distributions of the internal
   stresses, along with the means and variance, are calculated as a
   function of the mean grain size and temperature. The implementation of
   this work in assisting the interpretation of experimental results and
   predicting material properties is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorescence intensity of poly(p-phenyleneethynylene) (PPE) polymer
   separated from the surface of plasmonic silver nanocubes (47 nm AgNCs)
   is measured by varying the number of layers of polyvinyl pyrrolidone
   (PVPON) and polymethyl acrylic acid (PMAA), n. The shell thickness is
   sensitive to the solvent due to the formation of a solvent-sensitive
   hydrogen bonding network. The fluorescent behavior of the PPE on the
   core-shell PPE-(PVPON-PMAA) n-AgNCs structures fabricated here was
   evaluated as a function of n as well as the nature of the surrounding
   solvent. Surprisingly, the fluorescence intensity of the outer PPE shell
   is found to increase dramatically (by more than an order of magnitude)
   as its separation from the nanoparticle surface increases and then
   decreases at a distance that depends upon the swelling behavior of the
   polymer shells. The distance for the highest fluorescence enhancement
   was found to be 20.0 nm and 24.0 nm, in water and ethanol respectively.
   The observed change in the fluorescence intensity of the PPE polymer
   with increasing its separation from the plasmonic surface is proposed to
   result from the interplay between a short range quenching mechanism and
   a relatively long-range plasmonic fluorescence enhancing mechanism. DDA
   calculations gave support to the significant contribution of the latter
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we calculate the interaction energy of intrinsic point
   defects vacancies and interstitials) with screw dislocations in
   body-centered cubic iron. First (we calculate the dipole tensor of a

   based on linear elasticity theory, we calculate the interaction energy
   of the defect and the dislocation using both isotropic and anisotropic
   strain fields. Second, we perform atomistic calculations using molecular
   statics methods to directly calculate the interaction energy. Results
   from these two methods are compared. We verify that continuum methods
   alone are unable to correctly predict the interactions of defects and
   dislocations near the core. Although anisotropic theory agrees
   qualitatively with atomistics far from the core, it cannot predict which
   dumbbell orientations are stable and any continuum calculations must be
   used with caution. Spontaneous absorption by the core of both vacancies
   and dumbbells is seen. This paper demonstrates and discusses the
   differences between continuum and atomistic calculations of interaction
   energy between a dislocation core and a point defect.}},

Title = {{Confidence intervals for reliability indices using likelihood ratio

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{48-55}},
Abstract = {{Structural reliability theory has found numerous applications in various
   engineering fields, clue primarily to its introduction of the
   probability of failure or reliability index as a quantitative decision
   metric in the face of uncertain capacity and demand. In the development
   of first-generation probability-based design standards, the aleatory
   (inherent) and epistemic (knowledge-based) uncertainties were combined,
   leading to a point estimate of reliability. However, a critical aspect
   of quantified reliability assessment is the confidence level of the
   estimated failure probability, an aspect that becomes particularly
   significant in a reliability or risk assessment of an existing facility.
   The present study addresses this issue through an assessment of the
   confidence intervals on reliability indices using likelihood ratio
   statistics for cases where the capacity and/or demand models are derived
   from finite samples of data, expert opinion, or simulations. The
   proposed approach is applied to two realistic reliability assessment
   problems, revealing their applicability and accuracy in confidence
   interval estimation of reliability indices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{894-914}},
Abstract = {{This work introduces a new canonical model of worker cross-training,
   called a Fixed Task Zone Chain (FTZC), as a special type of zone-based
   cross-training and develops a methodology to employ it in U-shaped
   CONstant Work In Process (CONWIP) lines. The FTZC approach is intended
   to address lines with more stations than workers in environments where
   extensive cross-training is prohibitive. It incorporates a two-skill
   chain to cross-train one skill at each end of each zone; however, tasks
   at the interior of a zone are not cross-trained. A heuristic dynamic
   control policy is developed that maximizes the line's throughput given a
   zone structure. Some useful properties of the optimal policy are
   provided as a basis for a heuristic control policy that yields high
   throughput. The performance of an FTZC system is contingent upon the
   choice of zone structure; therefore, the zone assignment (ZonA)
   algorithm is created to design the zone structure to achieve high
   throughput levels. Sufficient conditions which guarantee that the line
   is balanceable through ZonA are derived. Benchmarking over a test suite
   supports the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic worker control
   policy as well as the ZonA algorithm, and its performance is compared
   with other paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{In a synchronous and fast-paced assembly line operation, it is crucial
   that the right parts are being supplied at the right time and at the
   right place. In automotive assembly, the need for efficient material
   handling part delivery is particularly great because of extensive
   product customisation and the lack of space to stock all the required
   parts at the assembly line. This paper introduces a mathematical cost
   model for evaluating the assignment of parts to one of two possible
   material supply systems: kitting or line stocking. Case data from an
   automotive company in Belgium is used to test the model. The results
   demonstrate that hybrid policies, where some parts will be kitted while
   others will be stocked in bulk at the line, are preferred to the
   exclusive use of either material delivery system. The factors
   influencing the preferred delivery method for individual parts are
   explored. Numerical results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting toxic chemical or biological agents in low concentrations
   requires a highly specific sensing technique, such as surface-enhanced
   Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The controlled synthesis of metallic
   nanocrystals has provided a new class of substrates for more reliable
   and sensitive SERS applications. The nanocrystal shape plays a major
   role in designing SERS substrates for maximizing the SERS enhancement
   factor (EF). Assembling nanocrystals into dimers can further amplify the
   EF, opening the door to the possibility of single-molecule detection.
   Here, we briefly discuss our recent work on the synthesis of silver (Ag)
   nanocrystals and their assembly into dimers and other reliable
   techniques to form hot spots with sufficiently high EF for
   single-molecule detection by SERS.}},

Title = {{Measurement of loss rates of organic compounds in snow using in situ
   experiments and isotopically labelled compounds}},
Journal = {{POLAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Organic molecular marker compounds are widely used to identify emissions
   from anthropogenic and biogenic air pollution sources in atmospheric
   samples and in deposition. Specific organic compounds have been detected
   in polar regions, but their fate after deposition to snow is poorly
   characterized. Within this context, a series of exposure experiments
   were carried out to observe the post-depositional processing of organic
   compounds under real-world conditions in snow on the surface of the
   Greenland Ice Sheet, at the Summit research station. Snow was prepared
   from water spiked with isotopically labelled organic compounds,
   representative of typical molecular marker compounds emitted from
   anthropogenic activities. Reaction rate constants and reaction order
   were determined based on a decrease in concentration to a stable,
   non-zero, threshold concentration. Fluoranthene-d(10), docosane-d(46),
   hexadecanoic acid-d(31), docosanoic acid-d(43) and azelaic acid-d(14)
   were estimated to have first order loss rates within surface snow with
   reaction rate constants of 0.068, 0.040, 0.070, 0.067 and 0.047 h(-1),
   respectively. No loss of heptadecane-d(36) was observed. Overall, these
   results suggest that organic contaminants are archived in polar snow,
   although significant post-depositional losses of specific organic
   compounds occur. This has implications for the environmental fate of
   organic contaminants, as well as for ice-core studies that seek to use
   organic molecular markers to infer past atmospheric loadings, and source
   emissions.}},

Pages = {{915-933}},
Abstract = {{In the early stages of an engineering design process it is necessary to
   explore the design space to find a feasible range that satisfies design
   requirements. When robustness of the system is among the requirements,
   the robust concept exploration method can be used. In this method, a
   global metamodel, such as a global response surface of the design space,
   is used to evaluate robustness. However, for large design spaces, this
   is computationally expensive and may be relatively inaccurate for some
   local regions. In this article, a method is developed for successively
   generating local response models at points of interest as the design
   space is explored. This approach is based on the probabilistic
   collocation method. Although the focus of this article is on the method,
   it is demonstrated using an artificial performance function and a linear
   cellular alloy heat exchanger. For these problems, this approach
   substantially reduces computation time while maintaining accuracy.}},

   produced by MOCVD. The scintillators consist of GaNepilayers grown on 2
   inch double side polished sapphire wafers, with neutron conversion
   layers on top. Two conversion materials were investigated: enriched LiF
   and Gd. Undoped and silicon-doped epilayers were examined for their
   scintillation properties. All of the scintillators showed neutron
   response when exposed to a thermalized AmBesource, however the LiF
   produced a peak which is more easily discriminated from the gamma
   response of the photomultiplier tube. Photoluminescence was used to
   examine the spectral content of the scintillation light, as well as to
   study self-absorption of the near-bandedge emission in GaN. (C) 2011

   critical factors of success. However, problems such as camera motion,
   lighting and weather changes, texture variation and inter-object
   occlusions result in misdetections or false positive detections which in
   turn, lead to broken tracks. In this paper, we propose to use background
   subtraction and an optimized version of Horn \& Schunk's optical flow
   algorithm in order to boost detection response. We use the frame
   differencing method, followed by morphological operations to show that
   it works in many scenarios and the optimized optical flow technique
   serves to complement the detector results. The Horn \& Schunk's method
   yields color-coded motion vectors for each frame pixel. To segment the
   moving regions in the frame, we apply color thresholding to distinguish
   the blobs. Next, we extract appearance-based features from the detected
   object and establish the correspondences between objects' features, in
   our case, the object's centroid. We have used the Euclidean distance
   measure to compute the minimum distances between the centroids. The
   centroids are matched by using Hungarian algorithm, thus obtaining point
   correspondences. The Hungarian algorithm's output matrix dictates the
   objects' associations with each other. We have tested the algorithm to
   detect people in corridor, mall and field sequences and our early
   results with an accuracy of 86.4\% indicate that this system has the
   ability to detect and track objects in video sequences robustly.}},

Title = {{A normal ray refinement technique for Cartesian-grid based Navier-Stokes
   solvers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{231-246}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a novel technique called normal ray refinement (NRR) is
   developed, implemented and investigated. Normal ray refinement is
   designed to allow for the viscous fluid flow simulations using an
   unstructured Cartesian grid framework in a computationally efficient
   manner. A key benefit of using a Cartesian grid method is that the grid
   can be automatically generated, thereby saving a vast amount of time and
   effort for complex geometries. The main drawback of using the Cartesian
   grid method is the large number of cells required to resolve viscous
   boundary layers, and it is this problem that the NRR approach addresses.
   The NRR approach relies on the use of refined normal rays of cells
   emanating from the body surface and spanning the boundary layer.
   Separating these rays along the body surface are relatively large cells
   too coarse to accurately capture viscous gradients. The heart of the NRR
   approach lies in the inter-ray communication strategies used between the
   normal rays that allow the accurate simulation of boundary layers even
   though the cells separating the rays are large. This yields a large
   reduction in the number of cells in the grid, which reduces the
   computational cost of simulation. This paper provides a background on
   different viscous Cartesian grid-based methods, followed by an
   explanation of the NRR approach, then some initial 2D results obtained
   using NRR for Reynolds numbers up to 1 million. It is shown that NRR can
   yield substantial reduction in computational cost relative to the
   standard Cartesian approach.}},

Title = {{Secondary organic aerosol formation from methacrolein photooxidation:
   roles of NOx level, relative humidity and aerosol acidity}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{247-262}},
Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from the photooxidation of
   methacrolein (MACR) was examined in a dual outdoor smog chamber under
   varied initial nitric oxide (NO) levels, relative humidities (RHs) and
   seed aerosol acidities. Aerosol sizing measurements and off-line
   chemical analyses by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and ultra
   performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation
   high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (UPLC/ESI-HR-Q-TOFMS) were used to characterise MACR SOA formation.
   Results indicate that both SOA mass and chemical composition largely
   depend on the initial MACR/NO ratio and RH conditions. Specifically, at
   lower initial NO levels (MACR/NO = similar to 2.7) more substantial SOA
   is formed under dry conditions (5-20\% RH) compared to wet conditions
   (30-80\% RH). However, at higher initial NO levels (MACR/NO = similar to
   0.9), the maximum SOA formation was marginally higher under wet
   conditions. Furthermore, UPLC/ESI-HR-Q-TOFMS data suggest that most
   particle-phase oligomers, which have been previously observed to form
   from the oxidation of methacryloylperoxynitrate, were enhanced under dry
   conditions. In addition to 2-methylglyceric acid and organosulfates
   derived from MACR oxidation, a nitrogen-containing organic tracer
   compound was found to form substantially in both chamber-generated and
   ambient aerosol samples collected from downtown Atlanta, GA, during the
   2008 August Mini-Intensive Gas and Aerosol Study (AMIGAS). Moreover,
   increasing aerosol acidity because of additional sulfuric acid appears
   to have a negligible effect on both SOA mass and most SOA constituents.
   Nevertheless, increased RH and aerosol acidity were both observed to
   enhance organosulfate formation; however, elevating RH mediates
   organosulfate formation, suggesting that wet sulfate aerosols are
   necessary to form organosulfates in atmospheric aerosols.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study on expected wind wave severity changes in the
   Adriatic Sea for the period 2070-2099 and their impact on extremes. To
   do so, the phase-averaged spectral wave model SWAN is forced using wind
   fields computed by the high-resolution regional climate model COSMO-CLM,
   the climate version of the COSMO meteorological model downscaled from a
   global climate model running under the IPCC-A1B emission scenario.
   Namely, the adopted wind fields are given with a horizontal resolution
   of 14 km and 40 vertical levels, and they are prepared by the Italian
   Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA). Firstly, in order to infer the wave
   model accuracy in predicting seasonal variability and extreme events,
   SWAN results are validated against a control simulation, which covers
   the period 1965-1994. In particular, numerical predictions of the
   significant wave height H-s are compared against available in-situ data.
   Further, a statistical analysis is carried out to estimate changes on
   wave storms and extremes during the simulated periods (control and
   future scenario simulations). In particular, the generalized Pareto
   distribution is used to predict changes of storm peak H-s for frequent
   and rare storms in the Adriatic Sea. Finally, Borgman's theory is
   applied to estimate the spatial pattern of the expected maximum wave
   height H-max during a storm, both for the present climate and that of
   the future scenario. Results show a future wave climate in the Adriatic
   Sea milder than the present climate, even though increases of wave
   severity can occur locally.}},

Abstract = {{Given a directed graph G = (V, E) and an integer k >= 1, a
   k-transitive-closurespanner (k-TC-spanner) of G is a directed graph H =
   (V, E-H) that has (1) the same transitive-closure as G and (2) diameter
   at most k. Transitive-closure spanners are used in access control,
   property testing and data structures. We show a connection between
   2-TC-spanners and local monotonicity filters. A local monotonicity
   filter, introduced by Saks and Seshadhri {[}SIAM J. Comput., pp.
   2897-2926], is a randomized algorithm that, given access to an oracle
   for an almost monotone function f : \{1, 2,...,m\}(d)-> R, can quickly
   evaluate a related function g : \{1, 2,..., m\}(d)-> R which is
   guaranteed to be monotone. Furthermore, the filter can be implemented in
   a distributed manner. We show that an efficient local monotonicity
   filter implies a sparse 2-TC-spanner of the directed hypergrid,
   providing a new technique for proving lower bounds for local
   monotonicity filters. Our connection is, in fact, more general: an
   efficient local monotonicity filter for functions on any partially
   ordered set (poset) implies a sparse 2-TC-spanner of the directed
   acyclic graph corresponding to the poset. We present nearly tight upper
   and lower bounds on the size of the sparsest 2-TC-spanners of the
   directed hypercube and hypergrid. These bounds imply stronger lower
   bounds for local monotonicity filters that nearly match the upper bounds
   of Saks and Seshadhri.}},

Abstract = {{High resolution imaging in the UV band has a lot of applications in
   defense and commercial systems. The shortest wavelength is desired for
   spatial resolution which allows for small pixels and large formats.
   UVAPD's have been demonstrated as discrete devices demonstrating gain.
   The next frontier is to develop UV APD arrays with high gain to
   demonstrate high resolution imaging.
   We will discuss model that can predict sensor performance in the UV band
   using APD's with various gain and other parameters for a desired UV band
   of interest. SNR's can be modeled from illuminated targets at various
   distances with high resolution under standard atmospheres in the UV band
   and the solar-blind region using detector arrays with unity gain and
   with high-gain APD's.
   We will present recent data on the GaN based APD's for their gain,
   detector response, dark current noise and the 1/f noise. We will discuss
   various approaches and device designs that are being evaluated for
   developing APD's in wide band gap semiconductors. The paper will also
   discuss state-of-the-art in UV APDs and the future directions for small
   unit cell size and gain in the APD's.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) techniques have shown promise for subsurface
   imaging applications using wideband sensors such as stepped-frequency
   ground-penetrating radars (GPR). Excellent images can be computed using
   the CS techniques. However, the problem size is severely limited for
   3-dimensional imaging problems which seem to require an explicit
   representation matrix that involves six dimensions. This paper shows how
   the underlying propagation model leads to a block-Toeplitz structure in
   two of the dimensions which can be exploited to reduce both the storage
   and computational complexity. The reduction by three orders of magnitude
   in computational resources for the CS problem will make 3-dimensional
   imaging applications feasible.}},

Title = {{Effect of crosslinking and long-term storage on the shape-memory
   behavior of (meth)acrylate-based shape-memory polymers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{7381-7392}},
Abstract = {{This work highlights the free- and fixed-strain shape-memory response of
   amorphous (meth) acrylate-based shape-memory polymers as the level of
   crosslinking is varied from uncrosslinked to highly crosslinked
   (corresponding to a decrease in failure strains and overall increase in
   rubbery moduli and failure stresses). The effect of long-term storage on
   the free-strain shape-memory response is also considered. Tensile
   deformation levels during the shape-memory cycle are 90\% of failure
   strain values to determine the full extent of free- and fixed-strain
   recovery behavior. All materials demonstrate full shape-recovery under
   free-strain conditions (material is unconstrained during recovery);
   however, total recoverable strains increase with decreasing crosslinking
   level, with uncrosslinked and lightly crosslinked materials recovering
   strains on the order of 3-10x that of moderately and highly crosslinked
   materials. In contrast, under fixed-strain conditions (material is fully
   constrained in the fixed shape during recovery), the magnitude of
   recovery stress generation increases with increasing crosslinking level,
   with highly crosslinked materials demonstrating recovery stress levels
   4-20x that of lightly crosslinked and uncrosslinked materials. The
   ability to produce recovery stresses on par with those reached during
   deformation also increases with crosslinking level. Stored-shape
   fixation and free-strain recovery levels remain stable after long-term
   storage in the deformed temporary state at 20 degrees C; however,
   recovery onset temperatures increase (by up to 9 degrees C) with storage
   time spanning similar to 1 year, as do rates of free-strain recovery (by
   up to 9x), due to physical aging. Results indicate that aging could
   potentially be used as a method for shape-memory response optimization.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{399-433}},
Abstract = {{Since the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
   Act in 1991, a significant number of state highway agencies have started
   to develop and implement statewide travel demand models to meet policy
   and legislative development needs. Currently, however, a lack of
   up-to-date multimodal and inter-regional passenger travel data hampers
   analysts' ability to conduct quantitative assessments of long-distance
   travel infrastructure investment needs, at both the national and
   statewide levels. Despite these data limitations, but also largely
   shaped by them, long-distance travel modelling has become an
   increasingly popular topic in recent years. This paper reviews several
   methodologies for multimodal inter-regional travel demand estimation,
   drawing examples from both state-specific modelling within the USA and
   from fully national models being developed and applied in other parts of
   the world, notably in Europe.}},

Title = {{Degradation modeling and monitoring of truncated degradation signals}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{793-803}},
Abstract = {{Advancements in condition monitoring techniques have facilitated the
   utilization of sensor technology for predicting failures of engineering
   systems. Within this context, failure is defined as the point where a
   sensor-based degradation signal reaches a pre-specified failure
   threshold. Parametric degradation models rely on complete signals to
   estimate the parametric functional form and do not perform well with
   sparse historical data. On the other hand, non-parametric models that
   address the challenges of data sparsity usually assume that signal
   observations can be made beyond the failure threshold. Unfortunately, in
   most applications, degradation signals can only be observed up to the
   failure threshold resulting in what this article refers to as truncated
   degradation signals. This article combines a non-parametric degradation
   modeling framework with a signal transformation procedure, allowing
   different types of truncated degradation signals to be characterized.
   This article considers (i) complete signals that result from constant
   monitoring of a system up to its failure; (ii) sparse signals resulting
   from sparse observations; and (iii) fragmented signals that result from
   dense observations over disjoint time intervals. The goal is to estimate
   and update the residual life distributions of partially degraded systems
   using in situ signal observations. It is showed that the proposed model
   outperforms existing models for all three signal types.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Abstract = {{A split load is a load having size no greater than the capacity of a
   single vehicle that is delivered using more than a single vehicle. The
   use of split loads can reduce the total transportation cost and the
   number of vehicles serving a set of loads. Several studies have shown
   the benefit of split loads as applied to the split delivery vehicle
   routing problem (SDVRP) and the pickup and delivery problem with split
   loads (PDPSL). While most research on the application of split loads to
   vehicle routing has revolved around heuristic methods, in this paper an
   exact solution method is used on a constrained version of the PDPSL. All
   origins to be visited must be served before any destination that is to
   be visited on each route, which we refer to as the precedence
   constrained-PDPSL (PC-PDPSL). Through this constraint, several
   structural characteristics that result from the SDVRP are shown to also
   hold for the PC-PDPSL. In particular, we develop a dynamic programming
   formulation of the PC-PDPSL and show that the state and action spaces of
   this problem are finite. We use the well-known A{*} `best-first' search
   algorithm from artificial intelligence to find an exact solution to a
   wide range of data sets. Computational experiments support findings
   developed using heuristic methods for the PDPSL, showing that splitting
   loads can reduce costs and that there is a relationship between average
   load size and cost savings.}},

Pages = {{13494-13499}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials such as graphene, boron nitride (BN),
   and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have been attracting increasing research
   interest in the past few years due to their unique material properties.
   However, the lack of a reliable large-scale production method is an
   inhibiting issue for their practical applications. Here we report a
   facile, efficient, and scalable method for the fabrication of monolayer
   and few-layer BN, MoS2, and graphene using combined low-energy ball
   milling and sonication. Ball milling generates two forces on layered
   materials, shear force and compression force, which can cleave layered
   materials into 2D nanosheets from the top/bottom surfaces, and the edge
   of layered materials. Subsequent sonication would further break larger
   crystallites into smaller crystallites. These fabricated 2D nanosheets
   can be well dispersed in aqueous solutions at high concentrations, 1.2
   mg mL(-1) for BN, 0.8 mg mL(-1) for MoS2, and 0.9 mg mL(-1) for
   graphene, which are highly advantageous over other methods. These
   advantages render great potential in the construction of
   high-performance 2D material-based devices at low cost. For example, a
   prototype gas sensor is demonstrated in our study using graphene and
   MoS2, respectively, which can detect several ppm of ammonia gas.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical applications of CBCT imaging are still limited by excessive
   imaging dose from repeated scans and poor image quality mainly due to
   scatter contamination. Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithms
   have shown promises in recovering faithful signals from low-dose
   projection data, but do not serve well the needs of accurate CBCT
   imaging if effective scatter correction is not in place. Scatter can be
   accurately measured and removed using measurement-based methods.
   However, in conventional FDK reconstruction, these approaches are
   considered unpractical since they require multiple scans or moving the
   beam blocker during the data acquisition to compensate for the
   inevitable primary loss. In this work, we combine the measurement-based
   scatter correction and CS-based iterative reconstruction algorithm, such
   that scatter-free images can be obtained from low-dose data. We lower
   the CBCT dose by reducing the projection number and inserting lead
   strips between the x-ray source and the object. The insertion of lead
   strips also enables scatter measurement on the measured samples inside
   the strip shadows. CS-based iterative reconstruction is finally carried
   out to obtain scatter-free and low-dose CBCT images. Simulation studies
   are designed to optimize the lead strip geometry for a certain dose
   reduction ratio. After optimization, our approach reduces the CT number
   error from over 220HU to below 5HU on the Shepp-Logan phantom, with a
   dose reduction of similar to 80\%. With the same dose reduction and the
   optimized method parameters, the CT number error is reduced from 242HU
   to 20HU in the selected region of interest on Catphan(C)600 phantom.}},

   Elastohydrodynamics}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{394-399}},
Abstract = {{Until very recently, viscometers have not had a significant role in the
   development of the field of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL).
   Viscosity has generally been treated as an adjustable parameter that
   assumed the values at elevated pressure necessary to validate whatever
   model was proposed. The description of the pressure dependence of
   viscosity in EHL requires the choice of a model that reproduces the way
   that viscosity changes with pressure and requires values for the
   parameters of the chosen model. Viscometers are necessary for both
   requirements if a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of film
   generation and friction is sought. Four types of pressurized
   viscometers, two based on Poiseuille flow and two on Couette flow, are
   investigated here. They yield remarkably similar pressure responses.
   There is therefore no ambiguity in the measurement of the pressure
   dependence of viscosity in pressurized viscometers. A significant
   challenge for engineers wishing to apply the results archived in the EHL
   literature is the assessment of the extent to which the results would be
   altered if an accurate viscosity had been employed. An important step
   toward establishing EHL as a quantitative science would be the
   designation of reference liquids for the pressure-viscosity effect and
   the use of these liquids in experimental and analytical investigations
   of EHL.}},

Abstract = {{One of the problems for lithographic processes at very small feature
   scales is pattern collapse caused by unbalanced capillary forces
   experienced by the photoresist patterns during the final deionized water
   rinse and drying process. The use of surfactants or super critical
   fluids to reduce collapse problems has been proposed and studied by many
   research groups. However, the patterns rinsed with low surface tension
   fluids appear in many cases to shrink or such treatments cause other
   feature deformations. Super critical fluid processing requires major
   changes to the ways in which current track systems operate and can
   result in swelling and deformation of the resist features as well.
   Instead of utilizing super critical fluids or adding surfactants to the
   rinse liquid, one general methodology we have pursued for alleviating
   such pattern collapse problems involves the actual strengthening of the
   resist feature itself during wet processing in the development and rinse
   cycle. One method we have investigated extensively is the use of
   post-development resist surface crosslinking reactions while the resist
   structures are still in their wet state, a process we term ``reactive
   rinsing{''}. Such reactive rinse processes have shown significant impact
   on improving resist pattern collapse. However, previous chemistries used
   for such reactive rinse processes have either: (1) been complex mixtures
   that potentially have long term stability problems (i.e. thus making
   their application in a fab environment more difficult) or (2) been
   specific to a certain resist types in that the chemistries react with
   only certain resist functional groups that may not be present in all
   resists of interest (e. g. some chemistries only work with phenolic
   resins such as those found in DUV or EUV resists). Therefore, the goal
   of this work has been to investigate other novel reactive rinse
   chemistries that are both more robust and which can function with
   different families of resist materials. Poly-functional aziridines offer
   one potential such family of compounds that could be the basis for a
   reactive rinse chemistry. Such aziridines are often used industrially in
   both aqueous and nonaqueous coatings, inks and adhesives to promote both
   physical and chemical properties and are known to react with carboxylic
   acid functional groups such as those commonly found in many 193 nm
   resists. The goal of this specific study was to determine if
   poly-functional aziridine chemistry could be used as a reactive rinse
   for preventing photoresist pattern collapse in 193nm type resists.
   Contact angle studies and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were
   used to characterize the surface crosslinking reaction using aziridine
   treatments of model resists containing carboxylic acid functionality.
   Pattern collapse test structures were fabricated and analyzed using a
   PMMA/PMAA copolymer resist commonly employed for e-beam lithography. SEM
   studies of the resulting patterns confirm that use of multifunctional
   aziridine crosslinkers during a post-development process can
   significantly reduce pattern collapse and enable production of higher
   resolution features.}},

   Raman lidar, a CIMEL sun-sky radiometer and the MODIS sensor. The
   BSC-DREAM model was used to forecast the dust event and to simulate the
   vertical profiles of the aerosol concentration. Due to mixture of dust
   particles with low clouds during most of the reported period, the dust
   event could be followed by the lidar only during the cloud-free day of 2
   April 2009. The lidar data obtained were used to retrieve the vertical
   profile of the optical (extinction and backscatter coefficients)
   properties of aerosols in the troposphere. The aerosol optical depth
   (AOD) values derived from the CIMEL ranged from 0.33-0.91 (355 nm) to
   0.18-0.60 (532 nm), while the lidar ratio (LR) values retrieved from the
   Raman lidar ranged within 75-100 sr (355 nm) and 45-75 sr (532 nm).
   Inside a selected dust layer region, between 1.8 and 3.5 km height, mean
   LR values were 83 +/- 7 and 54 +/- 7 sr, at 355 and 532 nm,
   respectively, while the Angstrom-backscatter-related (ABR(355/532)) and
   Angstrom-extinction-related (AER(355/532)) were found larger than 1
   (1.17 +/- 0.08 and 1.11 +/- 0.02, respectively), indicating mixing of
   dust with other particles. Additionally, a retrieval technique
   representing dust as a mixture of spheres and spheroids was used to
   derive the mean aerosol microphysical properties (mean and effective
   radius, number, surface and volume density, and mean refractive index)
   inside the selected atmospheric layers. Thus, the mean value of the
   retrieved refractive index was found to be 1.49( +/- 0.10) + 0.007( +/-
   0.007)i, and that of the effective radiuses was 0.30 +/- 0.18 mu m. The
   final data set of the aerosol optical and microphysical properties along
   with the water vapor profiles obtained by Raman lidar were incorporated
   into the ISORROPIA II model to provide a possible aerosol composition
   consistent with the retrieved refractive index values. Thus, the
   inferred chemical properties showed 12-40\% of dust content, sulfate
   composition of 16-60\%, and organic carbon content of 15-64\%,
   indicating a possible mixing of dust with haze and smoke. PM10
   concentrations levels, PM10 composition results and SEM-EDX (Scanning
   Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray) analysis results on sizes
   and mineralogy of particles from samples during the Saharan dust
   transport event were used to evaluate the retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the impact of mineral dust particles on clouds,
   radiation and atmospheric state during a strong Saharan dust event over
   Europe in May 2008, applying a comprehensive online-coupled regional
   model framework that explicitly treats particle microphysics and
   chemical composition. Sophisticated parameterizations for aerosol
   activation and ice nucleation, together with two-moment cloud
   microphysics are used to calculate the interaction of the different
   particles with clouds depending on their physical and chemical
   properties.
   The impact of dust on cloud droplet number concentration was found to be
   low, with just a slight increase in cloud droplet number concentration
   for both uncoated and coated dust. For temperatures lower than the level
   of homogeneous freezing, no significant impact of dust on the number and
   mass concentration of ice crystals was found, though the concentration
   of frozen dust particles reached up to 100 l(-1) during the ice
   nucleation events. Mineral dust particles were found to have the largest
   impact on clouds in a temperature range between freezing level and the
   level of homogeneous freezing, where they determined the number
   concentration of ice crystals due to efficient heterogeneous freezing of
   the dust particles and modified the glaciation of mixed phase clouds.
   Our simulations show that during the dust events, ice crystals
   concentrations were increased twofold in this temperature range
   (compared to if dust interactions are neglected). This had a significant
   impact on the cloud optical properties, causing a reduction in the
   incoming short-wave radiation at the surface up to -75 W m(-2).
   Including the direct interaction of dust with radiation caused an
   additional reduction in the incoming short-wave radiation by 40 to 80 W
   m(-2), and the incoming long-wave radiation at the surface was increased
   significantly in the order of +10 W m(-2).
   The strong radiative forcings associated with dust caused a reduction in
   surface temperature in the order of -0.2 to -0.5 K for most parts of
   France, Germany, and Italy during the dust event. The maximum difference
   in surface temperature was found in the East of France, the Benelux, and
   Western Germany with up to -1 K. This magnitude of temperature change
   was sufficient to explain a systematic bias in numerical weather
   forecasts during the period of the dust event.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to study droplet activation kinetics
   from measurements of CCN activity by the Continuous Flow Streamwise
   Thermal Gradient CCN Chamber (CFSTGC) and a comprehensive model of the
   instrument and droplet growth. The model, which can be downloaded from <
   a href='http://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/Experiments/CFSTGC.html
   `target='\_blank'> http://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/Experiments/CFSTGC.html
   </a >, is evaluated against a series of experiments with ammonium
   sulfate calibration aerosol. Observed and modeled droplet sizes are in
   excellent agreement for a water vapor uptake coefficient similar to 0.2,
   which is consistent with theoretical expectations. The model
   calculations can be considerably accelerated without significant loss of
   accuracy by assuming simplified instrument geometry and constant
   parabolic flow velocity profiles. With these assumptions, the model can
   be applied to large experimental data sets to infer kinetic growth
   parameters while fully accounting for water vapor depletion effects and
   changes in instrument operation parameters such as the column
   temperature, flow rates, sheath and sample flow relative humidities, and
   pressure. When the effects of instrument operation parameters, water
   vapor depletion and equilibrium dry particle properties on droplet size
   are accounted for, the remaining variations in droplet size are most
   likely due to non-equilibrium processes such as those caused by organic
   surface films, slow solute dissociation and glassy or highly viscous
   particle states. As an example of model application, data collected
   during a research flight in the ARCTAS 2008 campaign are analyzed. The
   model shows that water vapor depletion effects can explain changes in
   the observed average droplet size.}},

Abstract = {{Ink-jet printing enables a more efficient, economic, scalable
   manufacturing for a wide variety of materials than other traditional
   additive techniques. The impact of droplets onto a substrate is critical
   for accuracy control and optimization of the droplet deposition process.
   However, most previous research about droplet impact focused on the
   spreading radius of the droplet, which does not provide enough
   information for manufacturing purposes. This paper presents new methods
   to model and characterize droplet shape change during impact so that the
   droplet deposition process can be optimized to build desired geometries.
   A validated numerical model is used to study the shape change of the
   droplet impingement on a solid surface. A dimensional analysis is
   conducted to reduce the number of parameters of the impact conditions by
   matching Reynolds, Weber, and Froude numbers as well as possible. A wide
   range of impact conditions is simulated with the validated numerical
   model using both physical and dimensionless quantities. In addition, a
   new method of characterizing droplet shape is presented that measures
   its similarity to a desired shape. Using this measure, it is possible to
   track the evolving shape of a deposit formed by multiple droplets.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy is the standard
   method for a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, this
   biopsy approach uses two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images to guide
   biopsy and can miss up to 30\% of prostate cancers. We are developing a
   molecular image-directed, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound image-guided
   biopsy system for improved detection of prostate cancer. The system
   consists of a 3D mechanical localization system and software workstation
   for image segmentation, registration, and biopsy planning. In order to
   plan biopsy in a 3D prostate, we developed an automatic segmentation
   method based wavelet transform. In order to incorporate PET/CT images
   into ultrasound-guided biopsy, we developed image registration methods
   to fuse TRUS and PET/CT images. The segmentation method was tested in
   ten patients with a DICE overlap ratio of 92.4\% +/- 1.1 \%. The
   registration method has been tested in phantoms. The biopsy system was
   tested in prostate phantoms and 3D ultrasound images were acquired from
   two human patients. We are integrating the system for PET/CT directed,
   3D ultrasound-guided, targeted biopsy in human patients.}},

Abstract = {{An effective multisensor data fusion and visualization framework is
   proposed for accurate localization and effective visualization of
   delamination in concrete bridge decks based on impact echo (IE)
   nondestructive evaluation method. The fusion rules are developed by
   analyzing the spatial distribution of surface motion resulting from
   mechanical impacts applied at different locations based on numerical
   simulation. The proposed approach can process, integrate and interpret
   the data from a series IE source-receiver arrays to improve the accuracy
   and reliability of delamination characterization for bridge decks. The
   visualization approach provides an intuitive way for users to visualize
   the internal defects of concrete bridge decks.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the mechanical response of distinct carbon nanotube
   (CNT) morphologies as revealed by flat punch in situ nanoindentation in
   a scanning electron microscope. We find that the location of incipient
   deformation varies significantly by changing the CNT growth parameters.
   The initial buckles formed close to the growth substrate in 70 and 190
   mm tall CNT forests grown with low pressure chemical vapor deposition
   (LPCVD) and moved to similar to 100 mu m above the growth substrate when
   the height increased to 280 mm. Change of the recipe from LPCVD to CVD
   at pressures near atmospheric changed the location of the initial
   buckling event from the bottom half to the top half of the CNT forest.
   Plasma pretreatment of the catalyst also resulted in a unique CNT forest
   morphology in which deformation started by bending and buckling of the
   CNT tips. We find that the vertical gradients in CNT morphology dictate
   the location of incipient buckling. These new insights are critical in
   the design of CNT forests for a variety of applications where mechanical
   contact is important.}},

Abstract = {{Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers is a promising
   technology for extending the patterning capability of current
   lithographic exposure tools. For example, production of sub-40 nm pitch
   features using 193nm exposure technologies is conceivably possible using
   DSA methods without relying on time consuming, challenging, and
   expensive multiple patterning schemes. Significant recent work has
   focused on demonstration of the ability to produce large areas of
   regular grating structures with low numbers of defects using
   self-assembly of poly(styrene)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymers
   (PS-b-PMMA). While these recent results are promising and have shown the
   ability to print pitches approaching 20 nm using DSA, the ability to
   advance to even smaller pitches will be dependent upon the ability to
   develop new block copolymers with higher chi values and the associated
   alignment and block removal processes required to achieve successful DSA
   with these new materials. This paper reports on work focused on
   identifying higher chi block copolymers and their associated DSA
   processes for sub-20 nm pitch patterning. In this work, DSA using
   polystyrene-b-polyacid materials has been explored. Specifically, it is
   shown that poly(styrene)-b-poly(acrylic acid) copolymers (PS-b-PAA) is
   one promising material for achieving substantially smaller pitch
   patterns than those possible with PS-b-PMMA while still utilizing simple
   hydrocarbon polymers. In fact, it is anticipated that much of the
   learning that has been done with the PS-b-PMMA system, such as
   development of highly selective plasma etch block removal procedures,
   can be directly leveraged or transferred to the PS-b-PAA system. Acetone
   vapor annealing of PS-b-PAA (M-w=16,000 g/mol with 50: 50 mole ratio of
   PS:PAA) and its self-assembly into a lamellar morphology is demonstrated
   to generate a pattern pitch size (L-0) of 21 nm. The chi value for
   PS-b-PAA was estimated from fingerprint pattern pitch data to be
   approximately 0.18 which is roughly 4.5 times greater than the chi for
   PS-b-PMMA (chi(PS-b-PMMA) similar to 0.04).}},

Abstract = {{Directed self assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) could enable high
   resolution secondary patterning via pitch multiplication from lower
   resolution primary lithographic patterns. For example, DSA could enable
   dense feature production at pitches less than 20 nm from patterns
   generated using 193 nm exposure tools. According to theory, microphase
   separation of block copolymers can only occur when the critical
   condition that chi N>10.5 is met, where chi is the Flory Huggins
   interaction parameter and N is the total degree of polymerization for
   the block copolymer. In order to generate smaller DSA pattern pitches,
   the degree of polymerization of the block copolymer is reduced since
   this reduces the characteristic length scale for the polymer (e.g.
   radius of gyration). Thus, as N is reduced, the effect of this reduction
   on chi N must be balanced by increasing chi to maintain a given level of
   phase separation. Currently, most DSA work has focused on the use of
   poly(styrene)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) copolymers whose
   low chi value (i.e. similar to 0.04) limits the practical DSA pitch
   using such materials to approximately 20nm. The general goal of this
   work has been to explore new higher chi block copolymer systems, develop
   DSA patterning schemes based on such materials, and test their ultimate
   pitch resolution. This paper discusses the synthesis and
   characterization of poly(styrene)-b-poly(hydroxystyrene) (PS-b-PHOST)
   copolymers made via nitroxide mediated radical polymerization. The
   formation of lamellar fingerprint structures in PS-b-PHOST using solvent
   annealing is demonstrated. Using this fingerprint data, initial
   estimates of chi for PS-b-PHOST are made which show that it appears to
   be at least one order of magnitude larger than the chi for PS-b-PMMA.
   Finally, graphoepitaxy of self-assembled lamellar structures in
   PS-b-PHOST is demonstrated using SU-8 guiding patterns on cross-linked
   neutral underlayers.}},

Abstract = {{Airflow management is probably the most important aspect of data center
   thermal management. It is an intricate and challenging process,

   topics discussed in the book. The chapter begins by introducing the
   concept of system pressure drop and its influence on the computer room
   air conditioning (CRAC) unit performance. Various factors contributing
   to the overall pressure drop, such as plenum design, perforated tile
   open area, and aisle layouts, are described. Some of the key aspects of
   room and rack airflows are also discussed. The second part of the
   chapter highlights the importance of temperature and humidity control in
   data centers. The basic concepts of psychrometrics are introduced.
   Specific examples on data center cooling processes, such as sensible
   cooling, humidification/dehumidification and evaporative cooling are
   illustrated with the help of the psychrometric chart. The concept of
   airside and waterside economizers for data center cooling are
   introduced. The third and final part of the chapter describes an

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the sustainable and reliable operations of the
   electronic equipment in data centers are shown to be possible through a
   reduced order modeling based design. First, the literature on
   simulation-based design of data centers using computational fluid
   dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) and low-dimensional modeling are
   reviewed. Then, two recent proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based
   reduced order thermal modeling methods are explained to simulate
   multiparameter-dependent temperature field in multiscale thermal/fluid
   systems such as data centers. The methods result in average error norm
   of similar to 6\% for different sets of design parameters, while they
   can be up to similar to 250 times faster than CFD/HT simulation in an
   iterative optimization technique for a sample data center cell. The
   POD-based modeling approach is applied along with multiobjective design
   principles to systematically achieve an energy efficient, adaptable, and
   robust thermal management system for data centers. The framework allows
   for intelligent dynamic changes in the rack heat loads, required cooling
   airflow rates, and supply air temperature based on the actual momentary
   center heat loads, rather than planned occupancy, to extend the limits
   of air cooling and/or increase energy efficiency. This optimization has
   shown energy consumption reduction by 12-46\% in a data center cell.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter introduces a number of emerging topics in data center
   design and operation. The use of ambient air, water, or ground for heat
   rejection is attractive for many facilities whenever the environmental
   conditions are conducive. Changes in equipment layout and real-time

   opportunities for savings in cooling energy costs. As rack level powers
   continue to increase for several equipment classes, there is increasing
   interest in hybrid liquid/air cooling and liquid cooling approaches.
   Safety issues arising due to elevated temperatures and ambient noise are
   also receiving increasing attention. Broadening of equipment operation
   temperature and humidity ranges is resulting in concerns for wiring
   corrosion. Need for on-demand, rapidly deployable, and expandable

Pages = {{547-550}},
Abstract = {{A new type of compact dual-band directional antenna is proposed for
   2.4/5-GHz wireless access point and RFID reader applications. The
   dual-band antenna consists of a longer dipole for the lower band and a
   pair of shorter dipoles for the upper band. A simple coupling microstrip
   line is employed to excite the dipoles. Both the dual-band antenna and
   the feeding microstrip line are printed on the same substrate, leading
   to a fully planar structure. The length of the dipole for the lower band
   is shortened by a capacitive loading at each end of the dipole, offering
   a compact antenna configuration. The compact dual-band antenna achieves
   a desirable directional radiation pattern with an antenna gain of near 8
   dBi for the lower band and 9-10 dBi for the upper band. An equivalent
   circuit analysis for the design of the dual-band directional antenna is

Abstract = {{The proposed macroscopic optical histopathology includes a broad-band
   light source which is selected to illuminate the tissue glass slide of
   suspicious pathology, and a hyperspectral camera that captures all
   wavelength bands from 450 to 950 nm. The system has been trained to
   classify each histologic slide based on predetermined pathology with
   light having a wavelength within a predetermined range of wavelengths.
   This technology is able to capture both the spatial and spectral data of
   tissue. Highly metastatic human head and neck cancer cells were
   transplanted to nude mice. After 2-3 weeks, the mice were euthanized and
   the lymph nodes and lung tissues were sent to pathology. The metastatic
   cancer is studied in lymph nodes and lungs. The pathological slides were
   imaged using the hyperspectral camera. The results of the proposed
   method were compared to the pathologic report. Using hyperspectral
   images, a library of spectral signatures for different tissues was
   created. The high-dimensional data were classified using a support
   vector machine (SVM). The spectra are extracted in cancerous and
   non-cancerous tissues in lymph nodes and lung tissues. The spectral
   dimension is used as the input of SVM. Twelve glasses are employed for
   training and evaluation. The leave-one-out cross-validation method is
   used in the study. After training, the proposed SVM method can detect
   the metastatic cancer in lung histologic slides with the specificity of
   97.7\% and the sensitivity of 92.6\%, and in lymph node slides with the
   specificity of 98.3\% and the sensitivity of 96.2\%. This method may be
   able to help pathologists to evaluate many histologic slides in a short
   time.}},

Abstract = {{In the longitudinal study of the progression of a disease or the recover
   process of a treatment plan, often we are interested in seeking the
   answers to three questions: From where, how the situation evolves to its
   current state; To where, how the situation is going to evolve in the
   future; and How far, the evolution of disease/recovery is not always on
   the same pace as time. Hence, given two or more instances along the
   evolutionary path, how far they are from each other in the morphometric
   sense. In this work, we model such morphometry evolution using the
   theory of optimally transportation of mass, and aim at providing the
   answers to the previous questions under such framework. Mathematically,
   we solve the optimal mass transport (OMT) problem by solving the
   Monge-Ampere equation. As a result, instead of few discrete sampling
   points separated by a fixed amount of time, the entire morphometric
   evolution path can be computed. In addition, we can further extrapolate
   the path to predict the future status of the disease or recovery.
   Thirdly, a measurement for ``how advance is the disease{''} or ``how
   well the tissue is recovering{''} can be defined naturally and
   rigorously. The proposed method is applied on the cases in the traumatic
   brain injury and Huntington disease and both qualitative and
   quantitative results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The control of vibrating structures using piezoelectric elements
   connected to simple control circuits, known as shunts, is a widely
   studied field. Many different shunts have been researched that haven
   been shown to obtain strong performance in both narrow and broadband
   frequency ranges. Yet, the choice for the exact parameters of these
   shunts can be found different ways. In this work, a new method of
   selecting the components of a negative capacitance shunt is presented.
   An impedance model of a piezoelectric patch is developed and used to
   predict the control of a vibrating structure. The model predicts the
   magnitude of the strain induced voltage caused by the vibrating
   substrate through the computation of two voltage readings within the
   shunt. It is then confirmed experimentally, that it is possible to
   obtain experimentally the shunt parameters that produce maximum control
   through measurement of the shunt response.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{641-650}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of stem cells to environmental perturbations has
   prompted many studies which aim to characterize the influence of
   mechanical factors on stem cell morphogenesis and differentiation.
   Hydrodynamic cultures, often employed for large scale bioprocessing
   applications, impart complex fluid shear and transport profiles, and
   influence cell fate as a result of changes in media mixing conditions.
   However, previous studies of hydrodynamic cultures have been limited in
   their ability to distinguish confounding factors that may affect
   differentiation, including modulation of embryoid body size in response
   to changes in the hydrodynamic environment. In this study, we
   demonstrate the ability to control and maintain embryoid body (EB) size
   using a combination of forced aggregation formation and rotary orbital
   suspension culture, in order to assess the impact of hydrodynamic
   cultures on ESC differentiation, independent of EB size. Size-controlled
   EBs maintained at different rotary orbital speeds exhibited similar
   morphological features and gene expression profiles, consistent with ESC
   differentiation. The similar differentiation of ESCs across a range of
   hydrodynamic conditions suggests that controlling EB formation and
   resultant size may be important for scalable bioprocessing applications,
   in order to standardize EB morphogenesis. However, perturbations in the
   hydrodynamic environment also led to subtle changes in differentiation
   toward certain lineages, including temporal modulation of gene
   expression, as well changes in the relative efficiencies of
   differentiated phenotypes, thereby highlighting important tissue
   engineering principles that should be considered for implementation in
   bioreactor design, as well as for directed ESC differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops seismic fragility curves for vertical-pile-supported
   wharves commonly found in the western United States. Nonlinear
   time-history analyses of a two-dimensional numerical model under two

   the experiment-based limit states, the proposed fragility curves
   demonstrate that, at a PGA of 0.50 g, the probabilities of exceeding
   slight, moderate, extensive, and complete limit states are approximately
   23.0\%, 7.0\%, 4.0\%, and 3.0\%, respectively, while at a PGA of 1.00 g,
   the exceeding probabilities increase to 44.0\%, 19.0\%, 14.0\%, and

Abstract = {{A new fabrication process to manufacture a membrane electrode assembly

   conducted to study the feasibility and effectiveness of directly coating
   Nafion D2021 onto catalyzed Toray 060 carbon paper. The uniformity of
   the coated membrane and the penetration of the Nafion dispersion into
   the catalyst layer were analyzed. Pressing and blowing operations were
   introduced into the fabrication process to increase the membrane
   uniformity and to decrease the penetration of Nafion dispersion. The
   effects of these operations were analyzed. The performance of MEAs
   fabricated using the new process was measured and compared with MEAs
   made by traditional methods. It was found that MEAs formed by direct
   coating have similar electrochemical performance at current densities
   below 0.8 A/cm(2) as MEAs traditionally fabricated. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Doped ceria has been widely studied as electrolyte materials for
   intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). While high
   peak power densities have been reported, the electronic conductivity of
   doped ceria under fuel cell operating conditions reduces the open
   circuit voltage (OCV) and hence energy efficiency, more so with thinner
   electrolyte membrane at higher operating temperatures. Here we report a
   new cell structure: a thin SDC electrolyte membrane supported by a
   composite anode consisting of a mixed-ion conductor
   BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) and NiO. The inter-diffusion
   between BZCYYb and SDC during co-firing results in a thin layer of doped
   barium cerate and zirconate at the interface, which suppresses the
   electronic conduction of SDC and enhances the OCV and cell performance.
   The new cell structure also shows excellent stability when wet hydrogen
   or methane was used as fuel at 750 degrees C. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{A macroscopic phenomenological framework is used for developing a
   closed-form solution for analyzing the pure bending of shape memory
   alloy (SMA) beams. In order to study the effect of tension-compression
   asymmetry on the bending response, two different transformation
   functions are considered; a J(2)-based solution with symmetric
   tension-compression response, and a J(2) - I-1-based solution capable of
   modeling the tension-compression asymmetry. The constitutive equations
   are reduced to an appropriate form for studying the pseudoelastic
   bending response of SMAs, and closed-form expressions are obtained for
   the stress and martensitic volume fraction distributions in the cross
   section. These expressions are used for calculating the bending
   moment-curvature analytically. Both circular and rectangular cross
   sections are considered and several case studies are presented for
   analyzing the accuracy of the presented method and also the effect of
   considering the tension-compression asymmetry on the bending response of
   SMAs.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency-based beam steering concept effectively supports
   Guided-Wave-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by enabling
   directional waveguide inspection. This is implemented by acoustic
   transducers whose peculiar shapes provide different wavelength tuning in
   different directions. When these devices are used for guided wave (GW)
   sensing, spatial filtering of the propagating wavefield results in a
   prominent frequency component within the recorded signal spectrum, which
   can be uniquely associated with the direction of an incoming wave. A
   sensor geometry whose 2D spatial Fourier Transform produces a
   spiral-like distribution of maxima in the wavenumber domain allows for
   one-to-one frequency-angle correspondence in the {[}0 degrees, 180
   degrees] range. Prototypes of this wavenumber spiral frequency steerable
   acoustic transducer (WS-FSAT) have been fabricated by patterning the
   electrodes' shape on a metallized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
   substrate through inkjet printing. Prototype testing in various
   pitch-catch configurations demonstrates accurate 2D localization of
   acoustic sources and scattering events by processing a single output
   signal. Extremely easy, quick and inexpensive fabrication approach,
   along with very low hardware and computational requirements make the
   proposed FSAT an ideal candidate for a wide range of in-situ, low-cost
   and wireless SHM applications.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersive and multimodal guided wave propagation environments are often
   avoided in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications by single
   mode selection through narrowband excitation and wavelength tuning.
   However, scatterer-induced mode conversions are relevant to damage
   localization and characterization. A Bimodal Warped Frequency Transform
   (BWFT) is proposed to track the time-frequency structure of propagating
   waves undergoing mode conversion in dual-mode environments. The BWFT
   provides a two-dimensional representation of a recorded time-trace in a
   modal distance vs. total distance domain. Consequent ``modal path
   history{''} retrieval can effectively improve damage detection and
   characterization in broadband, multimodal regimes, as demonstrated both
   numerically and experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of six combined methods formed by three commonly-used soil
   hydraulic functions and two methods to determine soil hydraulic
   parameters based on a soil hydraulic parameter look-up table and soil
   pedotransfer functions was examined for simulating soil moisture. A
   novel data analysis and modelling approach was used that eliminated the
   effects of evapotranspiration so that specific sources of error among
   the six combined methods could be identified and quantified. By
   comparing simulated and observed soil moisture at six sites of the USDA
   Soil Climate Analysis Network, we identified the optimal soil hydraulic
   functions and parameters for predicting soil moisture. Through
   sensitivity tests, we also showed that adjusting only the soil saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, K-s, is insufficient for representing important
   effects of macropores on soil hydraulic conductivity. Our analysis
   illustrates that, in general, soil hydraulic conductivity is less
   sensitive to K-s than to the soil pore-size distribution parameter.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{433-444}},
Abstract = {{The use of small display devices is becoming more prevalent in our daily
   lives, such as smart phones, ultramobile PCs, and even head-mounted
   displays. Usually, the graphical user interface components shown on
   these displays are small and often difficult to interact with. Although
   some prior work has shown that Fitts' law does not hold for small target
   size, a detailed investigation of Fitts' law in different small target
   size conditions has yet to be done. In this study we conducted two
   experiments investigating the impact of small target sizes on pointing
   performance. We identified a critical point on the target size dimension
   where Fitts' law started to break down. We then proposed a small target
   size index of difficulty and an empirical Fitts' formula to extend the
   Fitts' law beyond the critical point to small target size conditions.
   Our results show that the new model works well as both a descriptive and
   a predictive model for small target size conditions.}},

Title = {{Gene Transfection Enhanced by Ultrasound Exposure Combined with Drug
   Treatment Guided by Gene Chip Analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{349-361}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Heterogeneous bioeffects have been reported in previous studies
   of ultrasound-mediated gene delivery. The goal of this study is to
   identify the differences between cells that take up plasmid DNA (pDNA)
   after sonication but are not transfected and cells that similarly take
   up pDNA but are transfected. We used these findings to select drugs that
   regulate intracellular processes expected to enhance gene transfection
   in combination with US.
   Materials and Methods: Gene expression among DU145 human prostate cancer
   cells after ultrasound-mediated transfection was analyzed using
   Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Drug treatments
   suggested by the microarray analysis were combined with US exposure to
   regulate the corresponding intracellular processes. Cell viability and
   transfection efficiency were determined by flow cytometry to analyze the
   effects of US combined with drug treatment.
   Results: Genes such as GADD45 alpha (growth arrest and DNA-damage
   inducible, alpha) and Topoisomerase II alpha were found to be associated
   with successful transfection. Drugs that regulate GADD45 alpha and
   Topoisomerase II alpha (e.g. ethyl methanesulfomate, amsacrine and
   chloroquine) were shown to increase ultrasound-mediated transfection
   efficiency by up to 2 fold.
   Conclusions: Among cells with pDNA uptake after sonication, we found
   that genes are differentially expressed among transfected cells versus
   non-transfected cells. Regulation of the expression level of GADD45
   alpha and TOP2 alpha and other intracellular processes can yield higher
   efficiency of ultrasound-mediated gene transfection. This suggests that
   a strategy to increase gene transfection efficiency involving the
   combination of sonication and regulation of intracellular processes
   using drugs could further enhance US-mediated gene transfection.}},

Abstract = {{This article briefly reviews recent developments in the fabrication of

   Six different synthesis conditions were used to produce different

Abstract = {{For the first time, we demonstrated that compressed aerogels made from
   crosslinked native cellulose nano/micro-fibril cellulose (NFC/MFC) show
   a fast shape recovery property after being immersed in water. The shape
   recovery degree in other solvents was also measured by the volume change
   of compressed aerogels. It was also found that the recovery degree
   strongly depends on the solvent properties. For water, more than 98\% of
   the original shape was recovered in less than 10 s. However, only about
   18\% of its original shape was recovered by immersing the compressed
   aerogel in ethanol, and no shape recovery was observed by immersing in a
   nonpolar solvent, such as toluene. The crosslinked native NFC/MFC
   network is strong enough to withstand hot water and mechanical agitation
   (200 rpm mechanical stirring in water). The possible mechanism of shape
   and volume recovery of compressed NCF/MCF aerogel is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigated the release and formation of oxalate
   during alkaline pulping of southern pine and acacia. The results showed
   that a significant amount of oxalate is formed during alkaline pulping

   have more oxalate in the wood and it also resulted in more oxalate
   formation than southern pine. A higher hydroxide concentration leads to
   higher oxalate content in the black liquor during the early stages of
   the cook. Oxalate formation can be described as a function of pulping
   time and temperature (H-factor), and the initial hydroxide concentration
   of the cooking liquor. More work is needed to understand the fundamental
   mechanism to produce a more fundamental predictive model for other wood

Abstract = {{A novel peer-to-peer (P2P) interconnection architecture in a 60-GHz
   millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radio-over-fiber (RoF) access network is

   lightwaves for downlink and P2P transmissions at the photodiode (PD) can
   provide signal up-conversion for both signals. Phase noise and frequency
   instability between the two independent lightwaves can be eliminated by
   a self-heterodyned radio frequency (RF) receiver (envelope detector)
   located on the user terminal, which can also down-convert simultaneously
   the two mm-wave signals to their associated intermediate frequencies. No
   high-frequency clock sources or other high bandwidth devices are
   required for signal up/down-conversions. A proof-of-concept experimental
   demonstration has also been carried out. Error-free transmission of the
   1-Gb/ signals is achieved over 50-km fiber (downlink) or 25-km fiber

Abstract = {{A major issue raised about development of cellulosic biomass derived
   fuels technologies is the concern about possible competition for land
   with agricultural crops and impacts on food and feed supply. However,
   because agave offers high productivity with low water and nutrient
   demands, it can thrive on semiarid lands not suitable for conventional
   agriculture, making it a promising lignocellulosic feedstock for
   biofuels production. Because agave composition will establish the
   maximum potential fuel yield that is vital to low cost conversion,
   detailed chemical composition data and cellulose characteristics were
   measured by standard biomass analysis procedures and solid-state NMR
   methods, respectively, for four agave samples: A. americana leaves, A.
   salmiana leaves, A. tequilana leaves, and A. americana heart. For the
   first time, we report substrate characteristics relevant to biochemical
   conversion for the tested agave species, specifically cell wall
   compositional data along with the relative proportions of cellulose
   ultra-structural components. The experimental results also provide an
   important baseline for further characterization and conversion of
   different agave species as biofuels feedstocks for semi-arid lands.}},

Abstract = {{Current procedures in post-earthquake safety and structural assessment
   are performed by a skilled triage team of structural engineers/certified
   inspectors. These procedures, in particular the physical measurement of
   the damage properties, are time-consuming and qualitative in nature.
   Spalling has been accepted as an important indicator of significant
   damage to structural elements during an earthquake, and thus provides a
   sound springboard for a model in machine vision automated assessment
   procedures as is proposed in this research. Thus, a novel method that
   automatically detects regions of spalling on reinforced concrete columns
   and measures their properties in image data is the specific focus of
   this work. According to this method, the region of spalling is first
   isolated by way of a local entropy-based thresholding algorithm.
   Following this, the properties of the spalled region are depicted by way
   of classification of the extent of spalling on the column. The region of
   spalling is sorted into one of three categories by way of a novel global
   entropy-based adaptive thresholding algorithm in conjunction with
   well-established image processing methods in template matching and
   morphological operations. These three categories are specified as the
   following: (1) No spalling; (2) Spalling of cover concrete; and (3)
   Spalling of the core concrete (exposing reinforcement). In addition, the
   extent of the spalling along the length of the column is quantified. The
   method was tested on a database of damaged RC column images collected
   after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, and comparison of the results with
   manual measurements indicate the validity of the method.}},

Abstract = {{For application in structural health monitoring, a folded patch antenna
   has been previously designed as a wireless sensor that monitors strain
   and crack in metallic structures. Resonance frequency of the RFID patch
   antenna is closely related with its dimension. To measure stress
   concentration in a base structure, the sensor is bonded to the structure
   like a traditional strain gage. When the antenna sensor is under
   strain/deformation together with the base structure, the antenna
   resonance frequency varies accordingly. The strain-related resonance
   frequency variation is wirelessly interrogated and recorded by a reader,
   and can be used to derive strain/deformation. Material properties of the
   antenna components can have significant effects on sensor performance.
   This paper investigates thermal effects through both numerical
   simulation and temperature chamber testing. When temperature fluctuates,
   previous sensor design (with a glass microfiber-reinforced PTFE
   substrate) shows relatively large variation in resonance frequency. To
   improve sensor performance, a new ceramic-filled PTFE substrate material
   is chosen for re-designing the antenna sensor. Temperature chamber
   experiments are also conducted to the sensor with new substrate
   material, and compared with previous design.}},

Title = {{Differences between downscaling with spectral and grid nudging using WRF}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Pages = {{3601-3610}},
Abstract = {{Dynamical downscaling has been extensively used to study regional
   climate forced by large-scale global climate models. During the
   downscaling process, however, the simulation of regional climate models
   (RCMs) tends to drift away from the driving fields. Developing a
   solution that addresses this issue, by retaining the large scale
   features (from the large-scale fields) and the small-scale features
   (from the RCMs) has led to the development of `nudging' techniques.
   Here, we examine the performance of two nudging techniques, grid and
   spectral nudging, in the downscaling of NCEP/NCAR data with the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The simulations are compared
   against the results with North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data
   set at different scales of interest using the concept of similarity. We
   show that with the appropriate choice of wave numbers, spectral nudging
   outperforms grid nudging in the capacity of balancing the performance of
   simulation at the large and small scales.}},

Title = {{Development of the high-order decoupled direct method in three
   dimensions for particulate matter: enabling advanced sensitivity
   analysis in air quality models}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{355-368}},
Abstract = {{The high-order decoupled direct method in three dimensions for
   particulate matter (HDDM-3D/PM) has been implemented in the Community
   Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to enable advanced sensitivity
   analysis. The major effort of this work is to develop high-order DDM
   sensitivity analysis of ISORROPIA, the inorganic aerosol module of CMAQ.
   A case-specific approach has been applied, and the sensitivities of
   activity coefficients and water content are explicitly computed.
   Stand-alone tests are performed for ISORROPIA by comparing the
   sensitivities (first- and second-order) computed by HDDM and the brute
   force (BF) approximations. Similar comparison has also been carried out
   for CMAQ sensitivities simulated using a week-long winter episode for a
   continental US domain. Second-order sensitivities of aerosol species
   (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) with respect to domain-wide SO2,
   NOx, and NH3 emissions show agreement with BF results, yet exhibit less
   noise in locations where BF results are demonstrably inaccurate.
   Second-order sensitivity analysis elucidates poorly understood nonlinear
   responses of secondary inorganic aerosols to their precursors and
   competing species. Adding second-order sensitivity terms to the Taylor
   series projection of the nitrate concentrations with a 50\% reduction in
   domain-wide NOx or SO2 emissions rates improves the prediction with
   statistical significance.}},

Title = {{Dual-Band Antennas for Frequency-Doubler-Based Wireless Strain Sensing}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{216-219}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, two dual-band antennas operating at 2.9 and 5.8 GHz are
   proposed and investigated in terms of the strain dependency of their
   resonances. They are designed to operate as strain-sensing and
   communicating devices at the same time in a frequency-doubling strain
   sensor that is interrogated wirelessly by a reader. An integration of
   transmit and receive antennas into one dual-band structure offers a
   compact sensor solution. The antennas' resonance frequencies shift if
   strain is applied, which in the case of the proposed antennas can be
   used to characterize the strain not only in terms of amplitude, but also
   direction. A very small size is achieved for an optimized one-feed
   design, which leads to high strain sensitivity values along one axis. A
   novel two-feed concept is designed to ease integration with the
   frequency doubler and detect strain in two directions with equal
   sensitivity. Return loss and radiation patterns of both designs are
   presented. Due to the wide beamwidths of both antennas, interrogation is
   possible from a wide range of angles.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports a new three-dimensional flexible lanthanide
   metal-organic framework {[}La(BTB)(H2O)center dot 3DMF](n) (BTB
   1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl) benzene) that possesses a rare chiral space
   group (P6(5)22), very high thermal stability (560 degrees C), and high
   surface area (1014 m(2) g(-1)). This new MOF demonstrates a large
   adsorption hysteresis loop on the N-2 isotherm at 77K after activation
   at 300 degrees C. Powder X-ray thermodiffraction experiments reveal that
   structural transformation occurs upon removal of guest molecules. The
   as-synthesized material is the ``open{''} form, while the activated
   sample is ``closed{''}. Adsorption isotherms of CO2 exhibit a dramatic
   step near a relative pressure of 0.3, which is similar to the location
   of the step in the N-2 isotherm at 77 K. Upon desorption, the material
   transforms to the closed form near a reduced pressure of 0.15, where it
   collapses back to the adsorption isotherm. Adsorption kinetic studies
   show that equilibrium is reached more slowly during the opening/closing
   steps compared to adsorption loadings measured on the static portion of
   the isotherm.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{The natural but unwelcome byproduct of modern telecommunication systems
   is electromagnetic interference (EMI). These communication networks are
   dynamic and produce unpredictable position- and time-varying
   electromagnetic fields that interfere with sensitive high-performance
   electronics, for which shielding is often a necessity. The shield's
   ability to suppress electromagnetic noise, however, may change not only
   over time but also across environmental conditions. EMI sensors, as a
   result, play a critical role because arbitrarily over-sizing a shield to
   accommodate worst-case conditions is not an option in many portable and
   mobile applications. This paper presents a logarithmically compressed
   peak-detection EMI sensor-interface circuit that combines the
   complementary functional strengths of state-of-the-art power detectors
   to monitor and sense 1-50 MHz of EMI with 5-bit accuracy across 16 dB of
   dynamic range and under -40 to 40 degrees C. The proposed circuit and
   printed-circuit-board (PCB) embodiment compensate for temperature
   variations as well as diode-induced errors to maintain and improve
   accuracy across a wide operating range. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {{Product platform flexibility planning by hybrid real options analysis}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{431-445}},
Abstract = {{Product platforms are believed to facilitate product design flexibility;
   however, the value and best form of such flexibility have yet to be
   fully understood. This article treats the design flexibility that is
   inherent in product platforms as being irreversible investment decisions
   that are crafted with a portfolio of platform real options that are
   continuously exercised to fulfill expected returns on investment. While
   options thinking has been appealing to the design community, the
   existing design real options models suffer from poor validity of the
   basic assumptions about the real options. Most existing work intuitively
   imitates real options decision making based on modularity and
   configuration. The missing link lies in the lack of an explicit time
   horizon, in which real options theory has its roots. This article
   proposes to craft platform real options in line with the management
   flexibility that is staged along the design project life. A hybrid real
   options analysis framework is developed by incorporating product-related
   and project-related flexibility to synthesize both financial and

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle dispersion plays a crucial role in the mechanical
   properties of polymer nanocomposites. Transmission Electron
   Microscope/Scanning Electron Microscope (TEM/SEM) images are commonly
   used to represent nanoparticle dispersion without further
   quantifications on its properties. Therefore, there is a strong need to
   develop a quantitative measure to effectively describe nanoparticle
   dispersion from a TEM/SEM image. This article reports an effective
   modeling strategy to characterize nanoparticle dispersion states among
   different locations of a nanocomposite surface. An engineering-driven
   inhomogenous Poisson random field is proposed to represent the
   nanoparticle dispersion at the nanoscale. The model parameters are
   estimated through the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to
   overcome the challenge of the limited amount of accessible data due to
   the time-consuming sample collection process. The TEM images taken
   fromnano-silica/epoxy composites are used to support the proposed
   methodology. The research strategy and framework are generally
   applicable to other nanocomposite materials.}},

   based on a nonminimal state-space realisation that generates an expanded

   The proposed adaptive control architecture requires only knowledge of

Title = {{Development of risk-based air quality management strategies under
   impacts of climate change}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{557-565}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is forecast to adversely affect air quality through
   perturbations in meteorological conditions, photochemical reactions, and
   precursor emissions. To protect the environment and human health from
   air pollution, there is an increasing recognition of the necessity of
   developing effective air quality management strategies under the impacts
   of climate change. This paper presents a framework for developing
   risk-based air quality management strategies that can help policy makers
   improve their decision-making processes in response to current and
   future climate change about 30-50 years from now. Development of air
   quality management strategies under the impacts of climate change is
   fundamentally a risk assessment and risk management process involving
   four steps: (1) assessment of the impacts of climate change and
   associated uncertainties; (2) determination of air quality targets; (3)
   selections of potential air quality management options; and (4)
   identification of preferred air quality management strategies that
   minimize control costs, maximize benefits, or limit the adverse effects
   of climate change on air quality when considering the scarcity of
   resources. The main challenge relates to the level of uncertainties
   associated with climate change forecasts and advancements in future
   control measures, since they will significantly affect the risk
   assessment results and development of effective air quality management
   plans. The concept presented in this paper can help decision makers make
   appropriate responses to climate change, since it provides an integrated
   approach for climate risk assessment and management when developing air
   quality management strategies.
   Implications: Development of climate-responsive air quality management
   strategies is fundamentally a risk assessment and risk management
   process. The risk assessment process includes quantification of climate
   change impacts on air quality and associated uncertainties. Risk
   management for air quality under the impacts of climate change includes
   determination of air quality targets, selections of potential management
   options, and identification of effective air quality management
   strategies through decision-making models. The risk-based
   decision-making framework can also be applied to develop
   climate-responsive management strategies for the other environmental
   dimensions and assess costs and benefits of future environmental
   management policies.}},

Title = {{A Critical Phenylalanine Residue in the Respiratory Syncytial Virus
   Fusion Protein Cytoplasmic Tail Mediates Assembly of Internal Viral
   Proteins into Viral Filaments and Particles}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the
   Paramyxoviridae family that assembles into filamentous structures at the
   apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. These filaments contain
   viral genomic RNA and structural proteins, including the fusion (F)
   protein, matrix (M) protein, nucleoprotein (N), and phosphoprotein (P),
   while excluding F-actin. It is known that the F protein cytoplasmic tail
   (FCT) is necessary for filament formation, but the mechanism by which
   the FCT mediates assembly into filaments is not clear. We hypothesized
   that the FCT is necessary for interactions with other viral proteins in
   order to form filaments. In order to test this idea, we expressed the F
   protein with cytoplasmic tail (CT) truncations or specific point
   mutations and determined the abilities of these variant F proteins to
   form filaments independent of viral infection when coexpressed with M,
   N, and P. Deletion of the terminal three FCT residues (amino acids
   Phe-Ser-Asn) or mutation of the Phe residue resulted in a loss of
   filament formation but did not affect F-protein expression or
   trafficking to the cell surface. Filament formation could be restored by
   addition of residues Phe-Ser-Asn to an FCT deletion mutant and was
   unaffected by mutations to Ser or Asn residues. Second, deletion of
   residues Phe-Ser-Asn or mutation of the Phe residue resulted in a loss
   of M, N, and P incorporation into virus-like particles. These data
   suggest that a C-terminal Phe residue in the FCT mediates assembly
   through incorporation of internal virion proteins into virus filaments
   at the cell surface.
   IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of
   bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and the elderly worldwide. There
   is no licensed RSV vaccine and only limited therapeutics for use in
   infected patients. Many aspects of the RSV life cycle have been studied,
   but the mechanisms that drive RSV assembly at the cell surface are not
   well understood. This study provides evidence that a specific residue in
   the RSV fusion protein cytoplasmic tail coordinates assembly into viral
   filaments by mediating the incorporation of internal virion proteins.
   Understanding the mechanisms that drive RSV assembly could lead to
   targeted development of novel antiviral drugs. Moreover, since RSV exits
   infected cells in an ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for
   transport)-independent manner, these studies may contribute new
   knowledge about a general strategy by which ESCRT-independent viruses
   mediate outward bud formation using viral protein-mediated mechanisms
   during assembly and budding.}},

   Its performance shows a clear advantage, in denoising applications, when

   as the reactant, together with zinc nitrate hexahydrate, ZnO NW arrays
   have been grown on various patterned metal layers, such as Au, Ag, Cu
   and Sn, without pre-depositing a seed layer. The mechanism for this
   novel synthesis route has been discussed and the effect of parameters
   such as ammonia concentration and solution/container volume ratio on the
   nanowire growth has also been investigated. Preferentially selective
   nucleation and the subsequent growth of ZnO NW arrays was demonstrated
   on patterns of different metals without a ZnO seed. Electrical
   characterization was subsequently performed to reveal the
   characteristics of the contacts formed between the ZnO NWs and the
   underlying metal layer. Further demonstration of the as-fabricated ZnO
   NW arrays on flexible substrates as an electromechanical switch in
   response to externally applied strain exhibits the potential
   applications of the demonstrated seedless synthesis of patterned ZnO NW
   arrays in areas ranging from sensing, and energy harvesting to
   interfacing piezotronics with silicon based technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Novel structures for multiple hydrogen atoms trapped at a monovacancy
   are discussed. Using atomistic simulations based on semiempirical
   interatomic potentials and density functional theory, we find low-energy

   the literature. The energetics of hydrogen binding are compared to
   results, both theoretical and experimental, previously published in the

Abstract = {{Numerical studies of PBXs are important for understanding the
   relationship between their mechanical properties and explosive behavior.
   The objective of this research is to analyze the thermomechanical
   response of HMX/Estane, a Polymer-Bonded Explosive (PBX), over a range
   of grain volume fractions at room temperature (300 K) and (epsilon) over
   dot = 16,667 s(-1). The analysis focuses on the correlation between
   grain-level failure mechanisms and the overall response using a
   Lagrangian cohesive finite element method (CFEM) framework. Digitized
   micrograph of an actual PBX is used in the analysis. The results
   indicate a transition in heating mechanism from viscoelastic dissipation
   in the binder to frictional heating at fractured surfaces. The delay
   time which signifies the time at which the transition occurs, is found
   to decrease linearly with increases in grain volume fraction. The
   results are useful in obtaining microstructure-performance relations
   that can be used in the design of advanced energetic materials.}},

   energy, strain energy, work expended on interfacial damage and failure,
   frictional dissipation along interfaces, and bulk dissipation via
   granular flow of the matrix as functions of microstructure, loading, and

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of granular materials can be quite complex due to
   phenomena that occur at the scale of individual grains. For this reason,
   mesoscale simulations explicitly resolving individual grains with
   varying degrees of fidelity have been used to gain insight into the
   physics of granular materials. The vast majority of these simulations
   have, to date, been performed with Eulerian codes, which do a poor job
   of resolving fracture and grain-to-grain interactions. To address these
   shortcomings, we utilize a peridynamic modeling framework to examine the
   roles of fracture and contact under planar shock and other loading
   conditions. Peridynamics is a mesh-free Lagrangian technique based on an
   integral formulation to better enable simulations involving fracture.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate decadal aerosol direct and indirect (warm cloud) radiative
   forcings from US anthropogenic sources over the 1950-2050 period. Past
   and future aerosol distributions are constructed using GEOS-Chem and
   historical emission inventories and future projections from the IPCC A1B
   scenario. Aerosol simulations are evaluated with observed spatial
   distributions and 1980-2010 trends of aerosol concentrations and wet
   deposition in the contiguous US. Direct and indirect radiative forcing
   is calculated using the GISS general circulation model and monthly mean
   aerosol distributions from GEOS-Chem. The radiative forcing from US
   anthropogenic aerosols is strongly localized over the eastern US. We
   find that its magnitude peaked in 1970-1990, with values over the
   eastern US (east of 100A degrees W) of -2.0 W m(-2) for direct forcing
   including contributions from sulfate (-2.0 W m(-2)), nitrate (-0.2 W
   m(-2)), organic carbon (-0.2 W m(-2)), and black carbon (+0.4 W m(-2)).
   The uncertainties in radiative forcing due to aerosol radiative
   properties are estimated to be about 50\%. The aerosol indirect effect
   is estimated to be of comparable magnitude to the direct forcing. We
   find that the magnitude of the forcing declined sharply from 1990 to
   2010 (by 0.8 W m(-2) direct and 1.0 W m(-2) indirect), mainly reflecting
   decreases in SO2 emissions, and project that it will continue declining
   post-2010 but at a much slower rate since US SO2 emissions have already
   declined by almost 60\% from their peak. This suggests that much of the
   warming effect of reducing US anthropogenic aerosol sources has already
   been realized. The small positive radiative forcing from US BC emissions
   (+0.3 W m(-2) over the eastern US in 2010; 5\% of the global forcing
   from anthropogenic BC emissions worldwide) suggests that a US emission
   control strategy focused on BC would have only limited climate benefit.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the climate response to changing US anthropogenic aerosol
   sources over the 1950-2050 period by using the NASA GISS general
   circulation model (GCM) and comparing to observed US temperature trends.
   Time-dependent aerosol distributions are generated from the GEOS-Chem
   chemical transport model applied to historical emission inventories and
   future projections. Radiative forcing from US anthropogenic aerosols
   peaked in 1970-1990 and has strongly declined since due to air quality
   regulations. We find that the regional radiative forcing from US
   anthropogenic aerosols elicits a strong regional climate response,
   cooling the central and eastern US by 0.5-1.0 A degrees C on average
   during 1970-1990, with the strongest effects on maximum daytime
   temperatures in summer and autumn. Aerosol cooling reflects comparable
   contributions from direct and indirect (cloud-mediated) radiative
   effects. Absorbing aerosol (mainly black carbon) has negligible warming
   effect. Aerosol cooling reduces surface evaporation and thus decreases
   precipitation along the US east coast, but also increases the southerly
   flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico resulting in increased cloud
   cover and precipitation in the central US. Observations over the eastern
   US show a lack of warming in 1960-1980 followed by very rapid warming
   since, which we reproduce in the GCM and attribute to trends in US
   anthropogenic aerosol sources. Present US aerosol concentrations are
   sufficiently low that future air quality improvements are projected to
   cause little further warming in the US (0.1 A degrees C over 2010-2050).
   We find that most of the warming from aerosol source controls in the US
   has already been realized over the 1980-2010 period.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of bis-(3-sulfopropyl)-disulfide (SPS) on the void-free
   electroless pillar-to-pillar bonding process has been investigated. Two
   dome-shaped Cu pillars were joined using electroless copper deposition
   with the addition of a suppressor to achieve solid, compliant Cu-to-Cu
   bonding without high temperature or pressure. SPS was added to the
   electroless copper plating bath which has strong suppression to the
   electroless plating in order to avoid the creation of an unbonded seam
   between the two Cu structures being bonded. The bath suppresses the
   deposition of copper near the entrance of the gap between the two
   pillars, while allowing high deposition rate in the geometrically
   restricted area between the copper structures being bonded. This
   phenomenon is due to diffusion of SPS through the narrow gap between the
   pillars being bonded. At adequate concentration of SPS, the two pillars
   were successfully joined without any remaining seam between the joined

Abstract = {{We have studied the electronic characteristics of multilayer epitaxial
   graphene under a perpendicularly applied electric bias. Ultraviolet
   photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that there is notable
   variation of the electronic density-of-states in valence bands near the
   Fermi level. Evolution of the electronic structure of graphite and
   rotational-stacked multilayer epitaxial graphene as a function of the
   applied electric bias is investigated using first-principles
   density-functional theory including interlayer van der Waals
   interactions. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that
   the tailoring of electronic band structure correlates with the
   interlayer coupling tuned by the applied bias. The implications of
   controllable electronic structure of rotationally fault-stacked
   epitaxial graphene grown on the C-face of SiC for future device
   applications are discussed.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{23-40}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous characterization of taxonomic composition, metabolic gene
   content and gene expression in marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) has
   potential to broaden perspectives on the microbial and bio-geochemical
   dynamics in these environments. Here, we present a metatranscriptomic
   survey of microbial community metabolism in the Eastern Tropical South
   Pacific OMZ off northern Chile. Community RNA was sampled in late
   austral autumn from four depths (50, 85, 110, 200 m) extending across
   the oxycline and into the upper OMZ. Shotgun pyrosequencing of cDNA
   yielded 180 000 to 550 000 transcript sequences per depth. Based on
   functional gene representation, transcriptome samples clustered apart
   from corresponding metagenome samples from the same depth, highlighting
   the discrepancies between metabolic potential and actual transcription.
   BLAST-based characterizations of non-ribosomal RNA sequences revealed a
   dominance of genes involved with both oxidative (nitrification) and
   reductive (anammox, denitrification) components of the marine nitrogen
   cycle. Using annotations of protein-coding genes as proxies for
   taxonomic affiliation, we observed depth-specific changes in gene
   expression by key functional taxonomic groups. Notably, transcripts most
   closely matching the genome of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon
   Nitrosopumilus maritimus dominated the transcriptome in the upper three
   depths, representing one in five protein-coding transcripts at 85 m. In
   contrast, transcripts matching the anammox bacterium Kuenenia
   stuttgartiensis dominated at the core of the OMZ (200 m; 1 in 12
   protein-coding transcripts). The distribution of N. maritimus-like
   transcripts paralleled that of transcripts matching ammonia
   monooxygenase genes, which, despite being represented by both bacterial
   and archaeal sequences in the community DNA, were dominated (>99\%) by
   archaeal sequences in the RNA, suggesting a substantial role for
   archaeal nitrification in the upper OMZ. These data, as well as those
   describing other key OMZ metabolic processes (e.g. sulfur oxidation),
   highlight gene-specific expression patterns in the context of the entire
   community transcriptome, as well as identify key functional groups for
   taxon-specific genomic profiling.}},

Abstract = {{The robotics field represents the integration of multiple facets of
   computer science and engineering. Robotics-based activities have been
   shown to encourage K-12 students to consider careers in computing and
   have even been adopted as part of core computer-science curriculum at a
   number of universities. Unfortunately, for students with visual
   impairments, there are still inadequate opportunities made available for
   teaching basic computing concepts using robotics-based curriculum. This
   outcome is generally due to the scarcity of accessible interfaces to
   educational robots and the unfamiliarity of teachers with alternative
   (e.g., nonvisual) teaching methods. As such, in this paper, we discuss
   the use of alternative interface modalities to engage students with
   visual impairments in robotics-based programming activities. We provide
   an overview of the interaction system and results on a pilot study that
   engaged nine middle school students with visual impairments during a
   two-week summer camp.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Motion on Distributed Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Sensor
   Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{We consider a set of mobile wireless sensors that collect observations
   about a brief, localized event. As they continue to move about, one of
   them processes its observations, decides that an event of interest
   occurred, and wants to determine if other sensors confirm its results.
   This sensor assumes the role of a Cluster Head (CH) and requests that
   all other sensors that collected observations at that time/location
   reply to it with their decisions. The motion of the sensors since the
   observation time determines how many wireless hops their decision must
   cross to reach the CH. We analyze the effect of this motion in the 1D
   case by modeling each sensor's motion as a Correlated Random Walk (CRW).
   We also account for measurement errors and communication or processing
   errors in each wireless hop. Quantities, such as the error probability
   of the final decision at the CH and the minimum energy required to
   collect the local decisions from all relevant sensors, can then be
   directly calculated as functions of time and the parameters of the CRW,
   the measurement noise and the channel noise. These results allow rapid
   characterization of the time-dependence of distributed detection
   algorithms that are executed in mobile sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{Organosolv switchgrass lignin is depolymerized and hydrodeoxygenated

   lignin is solubilized and 21 wt?\% of the biomass is shown to be
   converted into seven prominent molecular species that are identified and
   quantified. Reaction time is shown to be an important variable in
   affecting changes in product distributions and bulk liquid product
   properties. At 20 h of reaction, the lignin is significantly
   depolymerized to form liquid products with a 76?\% reduction in the
   weighted average molecular weight. Elemental analysis also shows that

Abstract = {{The routing metric is the measure by which a routing protocol chooses
   paths between pairs of source and destination nodes in the network.
   Routing metric has a significant impact on the network resource
   utilization. The most well-known intradomain routing disciplines in
   today's Internet are the minimum hop count routing (e.g., Routing
   Information Protocol (RIP)) and the shortest path routing (e.g., Open
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) and intermediate system to system (IS-IS)).
   In the former case, the routing metric is the number of hops over the
   path and in the latter one, the metric is evaluated with respect to an
   additive link weight function. In this article, we study the impact of
   these two types of metrics on routing of bandwidth-sensitive traffic in
   the network. We first argue that the main characteristics of a
   bandwidth-sensitive routing problem can be captured elegantly through
   transforming the problem from the networking domain into the sociology
   area. This model reveals that the minimum hop count is indeed a dominant
   Individualist view of resource management in the Internet, whereas the
   shortest-path metric has a collectivist trend. We then propose a novel
   hybrid metric, which combines the benefit of both sociological systems.
   Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme yields
   much better results, with respect to the number of admitted requests and
   delay of paths, compared with other well-known counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Fish rely on flow sensors for predator avoidance, hunting, rheotaxis,
   and other vital functions. The cupula on top of the sensory cells of
   these sensors is a structure that couples the water flow close to the
   fish and the receptor cells by efficiently absorbing the mechanical
   energy contained in the stimulus. The structure and mechanical
   properties of the fish cupula were investigated in order to develop a
   bio-inspired analogue to be used for synthetic flow receptors. After
   having studied the biological original structure, an engineered analogue
   of the cupula was developed. The addition of the artificial cupula to
   the flow sensors improved both the response magnitude (sensitivity) and
   the detection threshold by almost 40 times. In the end, the bio-inspired
   modification resulted in engineered sensors with capabilities comparable
   to those of the fish flow sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a methodology for the automatic generation of
   layout for radio frequency (RF) designs using embedded passives. Our
   methodology is divided into three steps: 1) pre-layout optimization; 2)
   placement and routing; and 3) post-layout optimization. We show that our
   methodology generates layouts with small area and good performance
   response within a fraction of design time compared with fully manual
   design effort. We make use of circuit models to represent and optimize
   the physical layout of the resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC)
   components as well as the entire RF circuit that uses them. We perform
   non-linear mathematical programming-based optimization at various stages
   of the methodology to achieve high quality layouts. Full wave
   electromagnetic simulations are kept completely out of the design loop,
   so our methodology significantly reduces design time. We have used our
   methodology to successfully generate layouts for large-scale filter
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded actives are to bury thinned active chips into package
   substrates, as opposed to surface mounted devices (SMDs), which can
   achieve smaller form factor, better electrical performance and higher
   functionality than the SMD technology. While many embedded actives have
   been explored so far, they are based on chip-first and -middle
   approaches, in which the active chips are embedded before and during the
   build-up processes of package substrates, respectively. The most concern
   with those two current approaches is the loss accumulation associated
   with the build-up layer processes carried out right on top of the
   embedded chips, which is highly likely to lose the embedded chips during
   their packaging process. The reworkability to replace the faulty chips
   embedded with good ones and thermal management of the embedded chips are
   also issues since the embedded chips are totally surrounded by
   hard-cured polymers. In this paper, chip-last embedded active has been
   proposed to address some of the issues that are reported in current
   chip-first and -middle approaches, in which chips are embedded after all
   the package substrate processes including the build-up layers are
   completed, just like conventional SMD packaging. In the chip-last
   approach, a cavity is introduced within the build-up layers of package
   substrate and a chip is directly embedded into the cavity. A first
   proto-type of the chip-last embedded active will be demonstrated by
   developing various cavity formation processes within the buildup layers
   and then embedding 100 mu m thick chips into the defined cavities.}},

Abstract = {{A xylan nanocomposite film with improved strength and barrier properties
   was prepared by a solution casting using nanocellulose whiskers as a
   reinforcing agent. The C-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning
   (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the spectral data
   obtained for the NCW/xylan nanocomposite films indicated the signal
   intensity originating from xylan-cellulose interactions. Qualitatively,
   the spectral data obtained for the NCW/xylan nanocomposite films
   indicated that the amount of xylan adsorbed to cellulose increases with
   the addition of NCW. In an attempt to quantify this effect, non-linear
   least-squared spectral line fitting was used to deconvolute the adsorbed
   xylan peak at similar to 82 ppm. The peak intensity ratio of adsorbed
   xylan peak and xylan C-1 peak, which represents the total amount of
   xylan increases suggesting that upon the addition of NCW, the amount of
   adsorbed xylan increases. In an effort to further infer the
   structure-property relationships associated with the observed strength
   and barrier properties, H-1 NMR T-2 relaxation experiments were also
   conducted to investigate the change in the nature of carbohydrate water
   interactions as a result of NCW incorporation. Water adsorbed into the
   50\% nanocomposite film had significantly shorter relaxation times with
   respect to the control xylan/sorbitol and all other NCW/xylan
   nanocomposite films. Additionally, X-ray diffraction of the
   nanocomposite films showed increased levels of crystalline material in
   the nanocomposites due to NCW addition.}},

   4-(trans-4'-4'-n-pentylcyclohexy)-benzonitrile (PCH5) and
   4-cyano-4'-octylbiphenyl (8CB) supported liquid crystal (LC) membranes
   was reported in order to broaden the understanding of mechanisms for
   solute transport in ordered mesophases. PCH5 was chosen as it exhibits a
   lower packing density than 8CB but retains a similar molecular
   structure. Higher sorption and diffusion coefficients were measured in
   PCH5 compared to 8CB, due primarily to the lower packing density in the
   PCH5 nematic phase. Solutes capable of forming a single hydrogen bonding
   with LC molecules exhibited faster diffusion than those with no
   hydrogen-bonding ability or those capable of multiple hydrogen-bonding
   interactions. Measurements of relative solubility of pyridine and
   salicylic acid in 8CB, PCH5 and kerosene confirmed that intermolecular
   hydrogen bonding plays a stronger role than pi-pi interactions in solute
   absorption. Finally, in the absence of differences in hydrogen bonding,
   higher dipole-dipole interactions resulted in lower diffusivities in

Abstract = {{Inclined silver nanorods (AgNRs) are highly anisotropic, with various
   applications in energy conversion, plasmonic and photonic devices, and
   sensing. So far, related studies have focused on the reflection or
   transmission, whereas studies on the diffraction and scattering from
   anisotropic AgNRs are still lacking. We investigate the anisotropic
   radiative properties of novel micro/nanoscale hybrid structures of
   inclined AgNRs deposited on compact disk (CD) gratings, which were
   fabricated with an oblique angle deposition technique. The reflectance
   of each diffraction peak and directional-hemispherical reflectance are
   characterized with a laser scatterometer and an integrating sphere,
   respectively, for both polarizations at a wavelength of 635 nm. The
   ordinary and extraordinary optical constants predicted from the
   effective medium theory (EMT) are incorporated into a rigorous
   coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) algorithm to estimate the diffraction
   efficiencies. The effect of scattering (mainly due to surface roughness)
   is also examined. The result shows that the orientation of the tilted
   nanorods with respect to the direction of grooves has a significant
   effect on both the energy distribution of the diffraction rays and the
   angular distribution of the scattered light for different polarizations.
   Such a hybrid structure may offer an alternative solution to engineering
   the radiative properties of a surface.}},

Title = {{Sequential measurement strategy for wafer geometric profile estimation}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Abstract = {{The geometric profile, factors such as thickness, flatness, and local
   warp, are important quality features for a wafer. Fast and accurate
   measurements of those features are crucial in multistage wafer
   manufacturing processes to ensure product quality, process monitoring,
   and quality improvement. The current wafer profile measurement schemes
   are time-consuming and are essentially an offline technology and hence
   are unable to provide a quick assessment of wafer quality. This article
   proposes a sequential measurement strategy to reduce the number of
   samples measured in wafers while still providing an adequate accuracy
   for quality feature estimation. In the proposed approach, initial
   samples are measured and then a Gaussian process model is used to fit
   the measured data and generate a true profile of the measured wafer. The
   profile prediction and its uncertainty serve as guidelines to determine
   the measurement locations for the next sampling iteration. The
   measurement stops when the prediction error of the testing sample set
   satisfies a pre-designated accuracy requirement. A case study is
   provided to illustrate the procedures and effectiveness of the proposed
   methods based on the wafer thickness profile measurement in slicing
   processes.}},

Title = {{Generalized selective assembly}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{27-42}},
Abstract = {{Selective assembly has traditionally been used to achieve tight
   specifications on the clearance of two mating parts. However, its
   applicability is not limited to this particular type of assembly. This
   article develops a generalized version of selective assembly called GSA.
   It is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the quality of
   assemblies of single units of different component types. Two variants of
   GSA are considered: Direct Selective Assembly (DSA) and Fixed Bin
   Selective Assembly (FBSA). The former is selective assembly using
   information from measurements on component characteristics directly,
   whereas the latter is selective assembly of components sorted into bins.
   For each variant, the problem of matching the N components of each type
   to give N assemblies that minimize quality cost is formulated as a
   linear integer program. The component matching problem for DSA is an
   axial multi-index assignment problem, whereas for FBSA, it is an axial
   multi-index transportation problem. Simulations are performed to
   evaluate the performance of GSA and to find the optimal number of bins.
   Realistic examples are given to show that the proposed methods can
   significantly improve the quality of assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{In a multistage manufacturing process, extensive amounts of

   features, process variables, and material properties. These data have
   temporal and spatial relationships and may have a non-linear data

   control that is based on a piecewise linear model. An engineering-driven
   reconfiguration method for piecewise linear regression trees is
   proposed. The model complexity is further reduced by merging the leaf

   likely come from imaging studies of RNA, which can generate the
   spatiotemporal information necessary to characterize RNA within the

   nonengineered RNAs, but the approaches for performing these experiments
   are still evolving. In order for them to reach their potential, it is
   critical that they have characteristics that allow for the tracking of
   RNA throughout their life cycle. This chapter presents an overview of

Abstract = {{A branch-price-and-cut algorithm is developed for a complex maritime
   inventory-routing problem with varying storage capacities and
   production/consumption rates at facilities. The resulting mixed-integer
   pricing problem is solved exactly and efficiently using a dynamic
   program that exploits certain ``extremal{''} characteristics of the
   pricing problem. The formulation is tightened by using the problem's
   boundary conditions in preprocessing and to restrict the set of columns
   that are produced by the pricing problem. Branching schemes and cuts are
   introduced that can be implemented efficiently and that preserve the
   structure of the pricing problem. Some of the cuts are inspired by the
   capacity cuts known for the vehicle-routing problem, whereas others
   specifically target fractional solutions brought about by individual
   vessels ``competing{''} for limited inventory at load ports and limited
   storage capacity at discharge ports. The branch-price-and-cut approach
   solves practically sized problems motivated by the operations of an oil

Abstract = {{A halide based growth chemistry has been demonstrated which can deliver
   a range of transition metals using low to moderate effusion cell
   temperatures (30-700 degrees C) even for high melting point metals.
   Previously, growth with transition metal species required difficult to
   control electron beam or impurity inducing metal organic sources. Both
   crystalline oxide and metal films exhibiting excellent crystal quality
   are grown using this halide-based growth chemistry. Films are grown
   using a plasma assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) system with
   metal-chloride precursors. Crystalline niobium, cobalt, iron, and nickel
   were grown using this chemistry but the technology can be generalized to
   almost any metal for which a chloride precursor is available.
   Additionally, the oxides LiNbO3 and LiNbO2 were grown with films
   exhibiting X-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curve full-widths at half
   maximum of 150 and 190 arcseconds respectively. LiNbO2 films demonstrate
   a memristive response due to the rapid movement of lithium in the
   layered crystal structure. The rapid movement of lithium ions in LiNbO2
   memristors is characterized using impedance spectroscopy measurements.
   The impedance spectroscopy measurements suggest an ionic current of .1
   mA for a small drive voltage of 5 mV AC or equivalently an ionic current
   density of similar to 87 A/cm(2). This high ionic current density
   coupled with low charge transfer resistance of similar to 16.5 Omega and
   a high relaxation frequency (6.6 MHz) makes this single crystal material
   appealing for battery applications in addition to memristors. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This paper presents preliminary field observations on the performance of
   selected steel structures in Christchurch during the earthquake series
   of 2010 to 2011. The Christchurch earthquake series comprised 6 damaging
   earthquakes, on 4 September and 26 December 2010, February 22, June 6
   and two on June 13, 2011. Most notable of these was the 4 September
   event, at M7.1 and MM7 (MM as observed in the Christchurch CBD) and most
   intense was the 22 February event at M6.3 and MM9-10 within the CBD. The
   earthquakes impacted on a range of steel framed buildings, from single
   storey to the tallest building in Christchurch at 22 storeys. Many of
   the multi-storey buildings used eccentrically braced framed
   seismic-resisting systems (EBFs) and this earthquake series was the
   first time these systems have been pushed into the inelastic range. This
   paper gives an overview of the performance of selected buildings, with
   an emphasis on EBFs. Their performance in particular was very good and
   possible reasons for this are presented.}},

Pages = {{1-16}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) can successfully deal with the growing demand and
   scarcity of the wireless spectrum. To exploit limited spectrum
   efficiently, CR technology allows unlicensed users to access licensed
   spectrum bands. Since licensed users have priorities to use the bands,
   the unlicensed users need to continuously monitor the licensed users'
   activities to avoid interference and collisions. How to obtain reliable
   results of the licensed users' activities is the main task for spectrum
   sensing. Based on the sensing results, the unlicensed users should adapt
   their transmit powers and access strategies to protect the licensed
   communications. The requirement naturally presents challenges to the
   implementation of CR. In this article, we provide an overview of recent
   research achievements of including spectrum sensing, sharing techniques
   and the applications of CR systems.}},

Title = {{Controls on hydrologic similarity: role of nearby gauged catchments for
   prediction at an ungauged catchment}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{551-562}},
Abstract = {{Prediction of streamflow at ungauged catchments requires transfer of
   hydrologic information (e. g., model parameters, hydrologic indices,
   streamflow values) from gauged (donor) to ungauged (receiver)
   catchments. A common metric used for the selection of ideal donor
   catchments is the spatial proximity between donor and receiver
   catchments. However, it is not clear whether information transfer among
   nearby catchments is suitable across a wide range of climatic and
   geographic regions. We examine this issue using the data from 756
   catchments within the continental United States. Each catchment is
   considered ungauged in turn and daily streamflow is simulated through
   distance-based interpolation of streamflows from neighboring catchments.
   Results show that distinct geographic regions exist in US where transfer
   of streamflow values from nearby catchments is useful for retrospective
   prediction of daily streamflow at ungauged catchments. Specifically, the
   high predictability catchments (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency NS > 0.7) are
   confined to the Appalachian Mountains in eastern US, the Rocky
   Mountains, and the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. Low
   predictability catchments (NS < 0.3) are located mostly in the drier
   regions west of Mississippi river, which demonstrates the limited
   utility of gauged catchments in those regions for predicting at ungauged
   basins. The results suggest that high streamflow similarity among nearby
   catchments (and therefore, good predictability at ungauged catchments)
   is more likely in humid runoff-dominated regions than in dry
   evapotranspiration-dominated regions. We further find that higher
   density and/or closer distance of gauged catchments near an ungauged
   catchment does not necessarily guarantee good predictability at an
   ungauged catchment.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore the extent to which increasing
   engagement would negate vigilance decrements in monitoring during a
   realistic air traffic control monitoring task. Technological advances in
   aircraft and navigation may change the controller's job from directing
   air traffic to more of a monitoring role with supervisory control.
   Research shows that humans are not effective monitors and can be subject
   to vigilance decrements. Even though vigilance decrements have been
   demonstrated in some settings, it is still not known if they are likely
   in a future ATC monitoring role. Sixteen undergraduates from the Georgia
   Institute of Technology trained for 6 weeks on NextSim, a medium
   fidelity ATC research simulator of the NextGen environment. They then
   performed 4 weeks of scenarios that required monitoring of flow
   corridors for failures of conflict evading technology. Two levels of
   engagement and two levels of attentional focus while monitoring were
   analyzed. Participants showed a significant vigilance decrement except
   after extended practice in the engaged condition. The findings of this
   study suggest that engaging the operator may alleviate the vigilance
   decrement, however only after practice.}},

   Identification of phenotypes for mutants in genes encoding muscle focal
   adhesion components}},
Journal = {{METHODS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-102}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans uses striated muscle in its body
   wall for locomotion. The myofilament lattice is organized such that all
   the thin filament attachment structures (dense bodies, analogous to
   Z-disks) and thick filament organizing centers (M-lines) are attached to
   the muscle cell membrane. Thus, the force of muscle contraction is
   transmitted through these structures and allows locomotion of the worm.
   Dense bodies and M-lines are compositionally similar to focal adhesions
   and costameres, and are based on integrin and associated proteins. Null
   mutants for many of the newly discovered dense body and M-line proteins
   do not have obvious locomotion defects when observed casually, or when
   assayed by counting the number of times a worm moves back and forth in
   liquid. We hypothesized that many of these proteins, located as they are
   in muscle focal adhesions, function in force transmission, but we had
   not used an appropriate or sufficiently sensitive assay to reveal this
   function. Recently, we have developed a new quantitative assay of C.
   elegans locomotion that measures the maximum bending amplitude of an
   adult worm as it moves backwards. The assay had been used to reveal
   locomotion defects for null mutants of genes encoding ATN-1
   (alpha-actinin) and PKN-1 (protein kinase N). Here, we describe the
   details of this method, and apply it to 21 loss of function mutants in
   17 additional genes, most of which encode components of muscle
   attachment structures. As compared to wild type, mutants in 11 genes
   were found to have less ability to bend, and mutants in one gene were
   found to have greater ability to bend. Loss of function mutants for
   eight proteins had been reported to have normal locomotion (ZYX-1
   (zyxin), ALP-1 (Enigma), DIM-1, SCPL-1), or locomotion that was not
   previously investigated (FRG-1 (FRG1), KIN-32 (focal adhesion kinase),
   LIM-8), or had only slightly decreased locomotion (PFN-3 (profilin)).

Abstract = {{Empirical methods used in conceptual aircraft design for the calculation
   of form factor drag and critical Mach number typically have been based
   on two-dimensional profile considerations alone or, at most, limited

   Motivated by the limited wing features modeled in current approaches,
   surrogate models for form factor and critical Mach number have been
   built as functions of airfoil thickness and trapezoidal wing parameters.
   These surrogate models are regressed from the results of a
   three-dimensional potential flow solution coupled to a profile
   boundary-layer analysis. The surrogates are physics based, yet their
   simple functional forms make them applicable for inclusion in aircraft
   sizing algorithms for rapid conceptual and preliminary design trade
   studies. The models capture the increasing influence of tip effects and
   spanwise flow as the aspect ratio is decreased and sweep is increased. A
   primary finding is the strongly beneficial effects of reduced aspect
   ratio on the form drag and critical Mach number of thick wings.}},

   to remote low-power sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles, where the added
   weight or volume of conventional harvesting designs can hinder flight

   fabricated, and tested to evaluate its energy harvesting and storage
   performance. A coupled electromechanical model based on the assumed
   modes method is developed to predict the vibration response and voltage
   response of a cantilevered wing spar excited under harmonic base
   excitation. Experiments are performed on a representative self-charging
   wing spar, and the results are used to verify the electromechanical
   model. The power-generation performance of the self-charging wing spar
   is investigated in detail for harmonic excitation in clamped free
   boundary conditions. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the
   ability of the wing spar to simultaneously harvest and store electrical
   energy in a multifunctional manner. It is shown that, for an input base
   acceleration level of +/- 0.25 g at 28.4 Hz at the base of the
   structure, 1.5 mW of regulated dc power is delivered from the
   piezoelectric layers to the thin-film battery, resulting in a stored
   capacity of 0.362 mAh in 1 h.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic signs are one of the important roadway assets. Transportation
   agencies are required to inventory sign assets, but current manual
   traffic sign inventory methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. A
   generalized traffic sign detection algorithm has been developed to
   automatically detect signs. However, correctly detecting sign images
   with discontinuous sign image boundaries (DSIBs) remains a challenge.
   This leads to false negatives (i.e., missing detection of signs), which
   critically affect the system reliability and hinder the implementation
   of an automatic sign detection system. This paper presents this critical
   issue of reducing false negatives. A hybrid active contour (HAC)
   algorithm is proposed with a new energy function on the basis of unique
   traffic sign characteristics, including location probability
   distribution function (PDF), statistical color model (SCM), and global
   curve length, to detect traffic signs with DSIB problems. The proposed
   HAC algorithm can be incorporated seamlessly into the existing sign
   detection algorithms to take advantage of the capability of the existing
   system while adding the strength of the HAC algorithm. The focused test
   shows that the proposed HAC algorithm can correctly detect 92\% of sign
   images with DSIB problems that could not be detected previously. Using
   actual video-log images provided by two transportation agencies (607 and
   1,547 images, respectively), the general test shows that the enhanced
   HAC-incorporated sign detection system can effectively reduce false
   negatives yet not add an excessive number of false positives. The
   false-negative rates decreased 6.8\% and 9.2\%, respectively, with
   minimal increase of false-positive rates. The preliminary results show
   that the proposed HAC algorithm has great promise for detecting sign
   images with DSIB problems. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000110. (C)

Abstract = {{We design and test micro-watt energy-harvesters inspired by tree trunks
   swaying in the wind. A uniform flow vibrates a linear array of four
   cylinders affixed to piezoelectric energy transducers. Particular
   attention is paid to measuring the energy generated as a function of
   cylinder spacing, flow speed, and relative position of the cylinder
   within the array. Peak power is generated using cylinder
   center-to-center spacings of 3.3 diameters and flow speeds in which the
   vortex shedding frequency is 1.6 times the natural frequency of the
   cylinders. Using these flow speeds and spacings, the power generated by
   downstream cylinders can exceed that of leading cylinders by more than
   an order of magnitude. We visualize the flow in this system by studying
   the behavior of a dynamically matched flowing soap film with imbedded
   styrofoam disks. Our qualitative visualizations suggest that peak energy
   harvesting occurs under conditions in which vortices have fully detached
   from the leading cylinder. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   California (central valley) water resources system (HRC-GWRI, 2007),
   coupled with a dynamic downscaling and hydrologic modeling system
   described in Georgakakos et al. (this issue). The assessment process
   compares the water system response in four simulated scenarios,
   pertaining to two management policies (traditional and adaptive) and two
   hydrologic data sets (one for the historical and a second for a future
   scenario). The assessments show that the current policy, which is tuned
   to the historical hydrologic regime, is unable to cope effectively with
   the more variable future climate. As a result, the water supply, energy,
   and environmental water uses cannot be effectively satisfied during
   future droughts, exposing the system to higher vulnerabilities and
   risks. By contrast, the adaptive policy maintains similar performance
   under both hydrologic scenarios, suggesting that adaptive management
   constitutes an effective mitigation measure to climate change. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The overall goal of the present study is to show through a simulation
   experiment the value of adaptive management under climatic variability
   and change. The Northern California water resources management system is
   used as an example of a multi-agency, multi-site, multi-objective water
   resources management system that supports a trillion dollar economy to
   demonstrate the utility of the methods and to exemplify the assessment
   studies. Simulations are performed using an adaptation of the Integrated
   Forecast and Reservoir Management (INFORM) system of Northern California
   with 6-hourly 1.4 degrees input from the CCSM3.0 climate model for
   historical/control (1970-2019) and future periods (2050-2099). The
   present paper examines the assessment of the hydroclimatological
   sensitivities and a companion paper (Georgakakos et al., this issue)
   examines the assessment of reservoir management sensitivities. The
   future period was based on the moderate CCSM3.0 A1B scenario. The INFORM
   system includes an intermediate complexity regional model for dynamic
   downscaling of the CCSM3.0 scenario output to produce surface
   precipitation and temperature fields with a 10 x 10 km(2) resolution,
   and snow-soil-channel modeling of all the watersheds upstream of the
   major reservoirs in Northern California. The flow results indicate a
   shift in the monthly average flow volume toward earlier times in the
   year and higher flow variability for the future period. Higher average
   temperatures in the future period and, consequently, earlier snow pack
   melt are mainly responsible for these flow changes. Both daytime and
   nighttime average monthly temperatures are higher in the simulation of
   the future period for the entire domain with the northern catchments
   experiencing higher temperature increases. Simulated monthly average
   precipitation for the future period is higher in the southern high
   Sierras and lower in the northern drainage basins than the historical
   period precipitation. The uncertainty in the assessments for Northern
   California mentioned may be estimated with additional simulations
   similar to those shown in this work using high spatial and temporal
   resolution output from different climate models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses, and optical absorption
   measurements are used to evaluate the film morphology, crystallinity,
   and optical density, respectively. These analyses are correlated with
   the extent of vertical segregation of TIPS-pentacene, as observed for
   the blended films by depth-profile XPS analyses. The microstructure and
   vertical phase segregation of TIPS-pentacene in blend films are found to
   be strongly influenced by the choice of solvent. Tetralin, a solvent
   with a high boiling temperature, was found to be more desirable for
   achieving distinct phase segregation/crystallization of TIPS-pentacene
   in blend films and best performance in OFETs with a dual-gate geometry.
   The electrical properties of top and bottom channels were consistent
   with the morphological characterization and OFETs processed from

Title = {{Microfluidic system for simultaneous optical measurement of platelet

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Abstract = {{Thrombosis is the pathological formation of platelet aggregates which
   occlude blood flow causing stroke and heart attack-the leading causes of
   death in developed nations. Instrumentation for diagnosing and exploring
   treatments for pathological platelet aggregation thus has the potential
   for major clinical impact. Most current thrombosis methods focus on
   single flow conditions, non-occlusive platelet adhesion, or low shear
   rates and so are limited in their application to comparative studies
   involving multiple, pathological test conditions (e. g., shear rate,
   stenotic geometries that mimic arteries, and rapid platelet accumulation
   to occlusion). The field could benefit from a low volume, high
   throughput, short analysis time, and low cost system while minimizing
   sample handling. We report on the design, fabrication, testing, and
   application of a microfluidic device and associated optical system for
   simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation at multiple initial
   shear rates within four stenotic channels in label-free whole blood.
   Following computational design, requisite shear rates were achieved in
   the device by micro-surface milling a mold and subsequent PDMS casting.
   We applied the microfluidic system to measure platelet aggregation in
   whole porcine blood for shear rates spanning physiological to
   pathological flow conditions (500-13000 s(-1)). Real-time, non-contact,
   label-free, microscope-free measurements of platelet aggregation were
   acquired using an optical system comprising a 650 nm diode laser and a
   linear CCD. We observed fully occlusive platelet aggregation in less
   than 20 min above a threshold initial shear rate of 4000 s(-1), and no
   occlusive platelet aggregation below 1500 s(-1) (N = 86 trials).
   Accumulation of thrombus was consistent between laser intensity, light
   microscopy, histology, and mass flow rate measurements. The amount of
   blood volumes producing occlusion were dependent on shear rate. Times to
   occlusion were not found to be dependent on shear rate above the
   threshold level of 4000 s(-1). This microfluidic system enables
   measurement of the entire process of occlusive platelet thrombosis in
   whole, unlabeled blood, in vitro, at multiple shear rates. Such a system
   may be useful as a point-of-care diagnostic tool for studying
   anti-platelet therapies in individual blood samples from high-risk
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Customized engineered fibers are currently being used extensively in the
   aerospace and automobile industries due to the ability to ``design
   in{''} specific engineering characteristics. Understanding the thermal
   conductivity of these new fibers is critical for thermal management and
   design optimization. In the current investigation, a steady-state dc
   thermal bridge method (DCTBM) is developed to measure the thermal
   conductivity of individual poly(ether ketone) (PEK)/carbon nanotube
   (CNT) fibers. For non-conductive fibers, a thin platinum layer was
   deposited on the test articles to serve as the heater and temperature
   sensor. The effect of the platinum layer on the thermal conductivity is
   presented and discussed. DCTBM is first validated using gold and
   platinum wires (25 mu m in diameter) over a temperature ranging from
   room temperature to 400 K with +/- 11\% uncertainty, and then applied to
   PEK/CNT fibers with diverse CNT loadings. At a 28 wt. \% CNT loading,
   the thermal conductivity of fibers at 390 K is over 27 Wm(-1) K-1, which
   is comparable to some engineering alloys. (C) 2012 American Institute of

   particles with trichlorosilane (TCS) under various reaction conditions.
   The reaction has been carried out with and without solvents and
   catalysts (Karsted's/Pt catalyst). TCS treated UTR particles are then
   hydrolyzed to obtain silanol functionalized hydrosilylated rubber

Title = {{Characterization of iron speciation in urban and rural single particles
   using XANES spectroscopy and micro X-ray fluorescence measurements:
   investigating the relationship between speciation and fractional iron
   solubility}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Soluble iron in fine atmospheric particles has been identified as a
   public health concern by participating in reactions that generate
   reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mineralogy and oxidation state
   (speciation) of iron have been shown to influence fractional iron
   solubility (soluble iron/total iron). In this study, iron speciation was
   determined in single particles at urban and rural sites in Georgia USA
   using synchrotron-based techniques, such as X-ray Absorption Near-Edge
   Structure (XANES) spectroscopy and microscopic X-ray fluorescence
   measurements. Soluble and total iron content (soluble + insoluble iron)
   of these samples was measured using spectrophotometry and
   synchrotron-based techniques, respectively. These bulk measurements were
   combined with synchrotron-based measurements to investigate the
   relationship between iron speciation and fractional iron solubility in
   ambient aerosols. XANES measurements indicate that iron in the single
   particles was present as a mixture of Fe(II) and Fe(III), with Fe(II)
   content generally between 5 and 35\% (mean: similar to 25 \%). XANES and
   elemental analyses (e. g. elemental molar ratios of single particles
   based on microscopic X-ray fluorescence measurements) indicate that a
   majority (74 \%) of iron-containing particles are best characterized as
   Al-substituted Fe-oxides, with a Fe/Al molar ratio of 4.9. The next most
   abundant group of particles (12 \%) was Fe-aluminosilicates, with Si/Al
   molar ratio of 1.4. No correlation was found between fractional iron
   solubility (soluble iron/total iron) and the abundance of Al-substituted
   Fe-oxides and Fe-aluminosilicates present in single particles at any of
   the sites during different seasons, suggesting solubility largely
   depended on factors other than differences in major iron phases.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear relationship between the electrical input signal and
   electrostatic force acting on the capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducer (CMUT) membrane limits its harmonic imaging performance.
   Several input shaping methods were proposed to compensate for the
   nonlinearity originating from the electrostatic force's dependence on
   the square of the applied voltage. Here, we analyze harmonic generation
   in CMUTs with a time-domain model. The model explains the basis of the
   input shaping methods and suggests that the nonlinearity resulting from
   gap dependence of the electrostatic force is also significant. It also
   suggests that the harmonic distortion in the output pressure can be
   eliminated by subharmonic ac-only excitation of the CMUT in addition to
   scaling the input voltage with the instantaneous gap. This gap feedback
   configuration can be approximated by the simple addition of a series
   impedance to the CMUT capacitance. We analyze several types of series
   impedance feedback topologies for gap feedback linearization. We show
   that for subharmonic ac excitation, although resistive and capacitive
   impedances result in a trade-off between input voltage and harmonic
   distortion for a desired pressure output, harmonic generation can be
   suppressed while increasing the Pa/V transmit sensitivity for proper
   series inductance and resistance feedback. We experimentally demonstrate
   the feedback method by reducing harmonic generation by 10 dB for the
   same output pressure at the fundamental frequency by using a simple
   series resistor feedback with a CMUT operating at a center frequency of
   3 MHz. The proposed methods also allow for utilization of the full CMUT
   gap for transmit operation and, hence, should be useful in
   high-intensity ultrasonic applications in addition to harmonic imaging.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{92-103}},
Abstract = {{A rehabilitation technique that utilizes a thin steel plate as a
   supplemental shear wall system for small, low-rise steel structures is
   described. In the proposed system, the plate and surrounding boundary
   elements are installed in the middle of the bay, separate from existing
   columns. This geometry intends to eliminate the need to strengthen the
   existing columns, as these typically would have been designed only for
   the combined forces of gravity and wind. The system employs supplemental
   elements as tension-only elements to speed up the construction work and
   to enforce strict capacity design principles (i.e., overstrength is
   capped). A prototype system was designed using a hierarchical flowchart
   and a simplified analysis model, and its performance was evaluated
   through large scale testing. The system achieved stable hysteretic
   behavior without showing major strength deterioration until large story
   drifts were reached. A high-fidelity FE model of the system was also
   developed to reproduce the experimental behavior. The model well traced
   the test results and was used as a tool for validating the effectiveness
   of the proposed system geometry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The high failure rate of ERP implementation is due to a common pitfall
   that ERP projects are often enacted as merely investment into
   installation of IT infrastructure, rather than systematic planning of
   operation changes, business process re-engineering and a paradigm shift
   for the operation and management. To manage ERP investment in a changing
   environment for high payoff, this paper adopts a real option theoretic
   method. Fuzzy payoff valuation is introduced to deal with uncertainties
   in order to minimize the risk of failure. The proposed ERP evaluation
   model is geared towards small and medium enterprises. A case study is
   presented to validate the proposed fuzzy real options. The results
   indicate the potential of modeling ERP investment as ``Expand{''},
   ``Contain{''} and ``Abandon{''} options in different scenarios. The
   fuzzy real option model bestows a novel ex-ante cost analysis for
   justifying ERP investment in the implementation cycle. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4953-4962}},
Abstract = {{As the colour palette of solution processable electrochromic conjugated
   polymers has extended from hues of purple and blue to vibrant colours
   such as yellow, orange, red, green, and cyan, the need for a counter
   electrode material that provides charge balance in electrochromic
   devices, but lends minimal colour, has become increasingly necessary.
   Nowhere is this more true than in absorptive/transmissive window-type
   devices where a high level of transparency and near colourlessness is
   needed in the device bleached state. This argument can also be extended
   to absorptive/ reflective display-type devices where an ``on''
   (coloured) and ``off'' (bleached or white) state is desired. Here, we
   report the development of a highly electroactive, low colouration
   efficiency propylenedioxypyrrole-based polymer that exhibits a low redox
   potential and minimal colour saturation in both fully neutralised and
   fully oxidised states. Thin films of the polymer, spray-cast onto
   transparent electrodes exhibited relatively low composite colouration
   efficiencies at 555 nm of 35 cm(2) C-1, contrasted with the the high
   colouration efficiency ECP-Magenta that exhibits 633 cm(2) C-1. we
   further demonstrate the utilisation of this polymer as an effective
   charge balancing counter electrode material in an absorptive/
   transmissive window-type device wherein the vibrantly coloured state and
   highly transmissive, near colourless bleached state of ECP-Magenta is
   maintained giving an overall device contrast of 61\% at 540 nm.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of chemically inert nanoparticles of anatase titanium dioxide
   (TiO2) on hydration rate of belite (beta-C2S) was studied using
   isothermal calorimetry. The TiO2 was added to beta-C2S paste at 0\%,
   5\%, and 10\% by mass. The results indicate that the addition of TiO2
   nanoparticles shorten the induction period and accelerate hydration
   beyond 3 similar to days, showing rate peaks at 40 similar to days of
   age. The cumulative heat data suggests that TiO2-containing C2S pastes

   to neat C2S pastes. These results suggest that addition of inert

   lower energy use compared to traditional chemistries.}},

Abstract = {{As the demand for higher capacity and longer reach of optical access
   networks is garnering momentum in recent years, coherent access
   technology attracts renewed interests in high-capacity optical
   networking. In this paper, designs of various coherent access networks
   are investigated and compared. From our results, it may be the most
   promising solution with high capacity at optimized cost. When coherent
   detection is employed in access network, the laser linewidth is a key
   design issue for optimized performance and cost as laser phase noise is
   larger with lower bit rate. One of our objectives is to examine the
   feasibility of employing a conventional DFB as carrier sources. We
   evaluated the performance of ultra-dense WDM access networking system.
   Experimental results show that 2.5GB/s QPSK data can be transmitted over
   35-km SMF-28 with 6.5GHz channel spacing using DFB lasers.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of cellulase distribution on the surface of cellulose
   fiber is an important parameter to understand when determining the
   interaction between cellulase and cellulose and/or the cooperation of
   different types of cellulases during the enzymatic hydrolysis of
   cellulose. In this communication, a strategy is presented to
   quantitatively determine the cellulase colocalization using the
   fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology, which is
   based on acceptor photobleaching and spectrally unmixing fluorescence
   microscopy. FRET monitoring of cellulase colocalization was achieved by
   labeling cellulases with an appropriate pair of FRET dyes and by
   adopting an appropriate FRET model. We describe here that the adapted
   acceptor photobleaching FRET method can be successfully used to quantify
   cellulase colocalization regarding their binding to a cellulose fiber at
   a resolution <10 nm. This developed quantitative FRET method is
   promising for further studying the interactions between cellulase and
   cellulose and between different types of cellulases.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of a cloud of inert particles with a detonation in gaseous
   mixture is simulated and studied. The structure of both two-and
   three-dimensional detonations are modeled using a simplified chemical
   model with Arrhenius kinetics. Particle clouds are characterized based
   on the initial solid phase volume fraction (alpha(p0)) of the particle
   cloud and the initial cloud length (L-0). The results show that the
   minimum average detonation speed decreases with increase in alpha(p0) at
   fixed L-0, and with an increase in L-0 at fixed alpha(p0). The
   detonation propagation through inert particle clouds is observed to fall
   into three regimes based on alpha(p0) and L-0. In the first regime, the
   detonation speed is suppressed, but the reaction zone and leading shock
   remain coupled, and the triple points are nearly unaffected. In the
   second regime, the detonation is temporarily quenched but restored as
   the particle cloud moves away from the detonation front. In the third
   regime, the detonation is quenched permanently or at least does not get
   restored within the time available for the detonation propagation. It is
   also shown that the effects of inert particle clouds on the detonation
   front in three-dimensional studies are qualitatively similar to the
   results from two dimensional simulations. However, in post-detonation
   flow where transverse velocity components are important, simulations in
   three dimensions are necessary, especially to estimate particle
   dispersion.}},

   The impulse imparted to the panels is varied from 4 to 42 kPa.s. The

Abstract = {{Recently efforts have been focused on ultra-high speed optical
   communication systems which can support 1Tb/s per channel transmission.
   However, 1Tb/s over a single carrier requires either or both very
   high-level modulation format (i.e. PDM-1024QAM) and high baud rate.
   Therefore, grouping a number of tightly spaced ``sub-carriers{''}, to
   form a terabit channel has been considered and this has been refered to
   as a superchannel. Nyquist-WDM and Coherent Optical-OFDM (CO-OFDM) are
   the two approaches to achieve ultra-high spectral efficiency in
   superchannel coherent optical systems. In Nyquist-WDM systems, optical
   subcarriers are tightly packed at channel spacing near or equal to the
   baud rate, potentially inducing strong inter-channel interference (ICI).
   The traditional way to mitigate the impact of ICI is by applying
   aggressive optical filters to each channel; however this typically
   induces severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). In this paper, we
   investigate receiver architectures for Nyquist-WDM superchannel coherent
   systems, and propose a new ``super receiver{''} architecture, which
   jointly detects and demodulates multiple channels simultaneously.
   Several joint DSP algorithms are developed and tested through
   experimental and simulated data. The simulation results showed that more
   than 5 dB ONSR gain was achieved comparing to conventional method at
   narrow channel spacing conditions.}},

Title = {{Reynolds number effects on scale energy balance in wall turbulence}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The scale energy budget utilizes a modified version of the classical
   Kolmogorov equation of wall turbulence to develop an evolution equation
   for the second order structure function {[}R. J. Hill, ``Exact
   second-order structure-function relationships,{''} J. Fluid Mech. 468,
   317 (2002)]. This methodology allows for the simultaneous
   characterization of the energy cascade and spatial fluxes in turbulent
   shear flows across the entire physical domain as well as the range of
   scales. The present study utilizes this methodology to characterize the
   effects of Reynolds number on the balance of energy fluxes in turbulent
   channel flows. Direct numerical simulation data in the range Re-tau =
   300-934 are compared to previously published results at Re-tau = 180
   {[}N. Marati, C. M. Casciola, and R. Piva, ``Energy cascade and spatial
   fluxes in wall turbulence,{''} J. Fluid Mech. 521, 191 (2004)]. The
   present results show no Reynolds number effects in the terms of the
   scale energy budget in either the viscous sublayer or buffer regions of
   the channel. In the logarithmic layer, the transfer of energy across
   scales clearly varies with Reynolds number, while the production of
   turbulent kinetic energy is not dependent on Reynolds number. An
   envelope of inverse energy cascade is quantified in the buffer region
   within which energy is transferred from small to larger scales. This
   envelope is observed in the range 6 < y(+) < 37, where all scales except
   the smallest scales display characteristics of an inverse energy
   cascade. The cross-over scale l(c)(+), which indicates the transition
   between production dominated and scale transfer dominated regimes,
   increases with Reynolds number, implying a larger range of transfer
   dominated scales, before the dominant mechanism switches to production.
   At higher Reynolds numbers, two distinct regimes of l(c)(+). as a
   function of wall-normal location are observed, which was not captured at
   Re-tau = 180. The variations of l(c)(+) match the trends of the shear
   scale, which is a representation of the mean shear in the flow. Thus,
   this study demonstrates the utility and importance of the use of higher
   Reynolds number data in order to accurately characterize and understand
   the energy dynamics of various scales across the entire boundary layer.

Abstract = {{Artificial sponge was used as the template to produce carbon/epoxy resin
   composites with interpenetrating network structure. Carbon with a
   network structure was first obtained by the pyrolysis of sponge. The
   composites were then obtained by injecting epoxy resin into the carbon.
   Their microstructures and wear properties were analyzed. The results
   show that the structure of sponge controlled the interpenetrating
   network structures of the carbon/epoxy resin composites. The
   carbon-network in the composites was shown to stabilize the coefficient
   of friction of epoxy resin. The carbon also reduces the wear rate of the
   epoxy resin remarkably.}},

Abstract = {{Equipping miniaturised catalytic swimming devices with the ability to
   autonomously navigate in response to solution borne stimuli is an
   attractive route to enabling drug delivery and other transport
   applications. Here we use simulations of swarms of swimming devices made
   from pH responsive size changing hydrogels, to investigate their
   statistical response to pH variations. We find that the velocity
   modulation associated with size change, a recently discovered
   fundamental feature for the catalytic swimmer propulsion mechanism,
   produces a significant rapid statistical accumulation in high pH
   regions. This is augmented by size change induced modulation of the
   Brownian rotational rate, which unexpectedly also causes an accumulation
   in high pH regions, due to a caging effect imposed by the pH gradient.
   These simulations consequently show the feasibility of using size
   changing materials to navigate swimming devices autonomously in response
   to a stimulus within a constant fuel concentration environment.}},

Title = {{Correlates of Tricuspid Regurgitation as Determined by 3D
   Echocardiography: Pulmonary Arterial Pressure, Ventricle Geometry,
   Annular Dilatation, and Papillary Muscle Displacement}},
Journal = {{CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background-While it is understood that annular dilatation contributes to
   tricuspid regurgitation (TR), other factors are less clear. The geometry
   of the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) may alter tricuspid
   annulus size and papillary muscle (PM) positions leading to TR.
   Methods and Results-Three-dimensional echocardiographic images were
   obtained at Emory University Hospital using a GE Vivid 7 ultrasound
   system. End-diastolic area was used to classify ventricle geometry:
   control (n=21), isolated RV dilatation (n=17), isolated LV dilatation
   (n=13), and both RV and LV dilatation (n=13). GE EchoPAC was used to
   measure annulus area and position of the PM tips. Patients with RV
   dilatation had significant (P <= 0.05) displacement of all PMs apically
   and the septal PM and posterior PM away from the center of the RV toward
   the LV. Patients with LV dilatation had significant (P <= 0.05) apical
   displacement of the anterior PM. Pulmonary arterial pressure (r=0.66),
   annulus area (r=0.51), apical displacement of the anterior PM (r=0.26),
   posterior PM (r=0.49), and septal PM (r=0.40), lateral displacement of
   the septal PM (r=0.37) and posterior PM (r=0.40), and tenting area and
   height (r=0.54, 0.49), were significantly (P <= 0.05) correlated to the
   grade of TR. Ventricle classification (r=0.46) and RV end-diastolic area
   (r=0.48) also were correlated with the grade of TR. A regression
   analysis found ventricle classification (P=0.001), pulmonary arterial
   pressure (P<0.001) annulus area (P=0.027), and apical displacement of
   the anterior PM (P=0.061) to be associated with the grade of TR.
   Conclusions-Alterations in ventricular geometry can lead to TR by
   altering both tricuspid annulus size and PM position. Understanding
   these geometric interactions with the aim of correcting pathological
   alterations of the tricuspid valve apparatus may lead to more robust
   repairs. (Circ Cardiovasc Imaging. 2012;5:43-50.)}},

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient wireless communication is very important for
   battery-constrained mobile devices. For mobile devices in a cellular
   system, uplink power consumption dominates the wireless power budget
   because of RF power requirements for reliable transmission over long
   distances. Our previous work in this area focused on optimizing energy
   efficiency by maximizing the instantaneous bits-per-Joule metric through
   iterative approaches, which resulted in significant energy savings for
   uplink cellular OFDMA transmissions. In this paper, we develop energy
   efficient schemes with significantly lower complexity when compared to
   iterative approaches, by considering time-averaged bits-per-Joule
   metrics. We consider an uplink OFDMA system where multiple users
   communicate to a central scheduler over frequency-selective channels
   with high energy efficiency. The scheduler allocates the system
   bandwidth among all users to optimize energy efficiency across the whole
   network. Using time-averaged metrics, we derive energy optimal
   techniques in ``closed forms{''} for per-user link adaptation and
   resource scheduling across users. Simulation results show that the
   proposed schemes not only have low complexity but also perform close to
   the globally optimum solutions obtained through exhaustive search.}},

Title = {{The role of residue C410 on activation of the human vitamin D receptor
   by various ligands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that
   regulate the expression of genes involved in biologically important
   processes. The human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) is a member of the NR
   superfamily and is responsible for maintaining calcium and phosphate
   homeostasis. This receptor is activated by its natural ligand, 1 alpha,
   25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1 alpha, 25(OH)(2)D-3), as well as bile acids
   such as lithocholic acid (LCA). Disruption of molecular interactions
   between the hVDR and its natural ligand result in adverse diseases, such
   as rickets, making this receptor a good target for drug discovery.
   Previous mutational analyses of the hVDR have mainly focused on residues
   lining the receptor's ligand binding pocket (LBP) and techniques such as
   alanine scanning mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis. In this
   work, a rationally designed hVDR library using randomized codons at
   selected positions provides insight into the role of residue C410,
   particularly on activation of the receptor by various ligands. A
   variant, C410Y, was engineered to bind LCA with increased sensitivity
   (EC50 value of 3 mu M and a 34-fold activation) in mammalian cell
   culture assays. Furthermore, this variant displayed activation with a
   novel small molecule, cholecalciferol (chole) which does not activate
   the wild-type receptor, with an EC50 value of 4 mu M and a 25-fold
   activation. The presence of a bulky residue at this position, such as a
   tyrosine or phenylalanine, may contribute towards molecular interactions
   that allow for the enhanced activation with LCA and novel activation
   with chole. Additional bulk at the same end of the pocket, such as in
   the case of the variant H305F; C410Y enhances the receptor's sensitivity
   for these ligands further, perhaps due to the filling of a cavity. The
   effects of residue C410 on specificity and activation with the different
   ligands studied were unforeseen, as this residue does not line the
   hVDR's LBP. Further investigating of the structure-function
   relationships between the hVDR and its ligands, including the mutational
   tolerance of residues within as well as outside the LBP, is needed for a
   comprehensive understanding of the functionality and interactions of the
   receptor with these ligands and for development of new small molecules
   as potential therapeutic drugs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped graphene (nG) is a promising metal-free catalyst for
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of fuel cells. Here we
   report a facile preparation of nG via pyrolysis of graphene oxide with
   melamine. The morphology of the nG is revealed using scanning electron
   microscopy and transmission electron microscopy while the successful N
   doping is confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. The resulting nG shows high electrocatalytic
   activity toward ORR in an alkaline solution with an onset potential of
   -0.10 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The nG catalyzed oxygen
   reduction exhibits a favorable formation of water via a four-electron
   pathway. Good stability and anti-crossover property are also observed,
   which are advantageous over the Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the effect
   of pyrolysis temperature on the structure and activity of nG is
   systematically studied to gain some insights into the chemical reactions
   during pyrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of complex quantum systems having many partitions is a very
   complicated numerical task. As the number of entities increase, the
   computational burden blows up and at the same time accuracy is lost due
   to integration in time-domain. Here, we present a systematic and
   rigorous methodology to deal with the multi-partite quantum systems
   comprised of many quantum dots with arbitrary transition oscillator
   strengths as well as dipole-dipole interaction. No limit is imposed on
   the number of radiation modes in the interacting reservoir. We present
   an exact solution to this system and also a general self-generating
   automated code which is capable of solving the system in time-domain
   with full accuracy and maximal computational efficiency. The code is
   also able to compute the exact concurrency as the measure of
   entanglement. Various coupling regimes ranging from the weak to
   ultrastrong are analyzed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanowires show promise in a broad range of applications, but many
   synthesis techniques require complex methodologies. We have developed a
   method for depositing patterned aluminum nanowires (Al NWs) onto Cu, Ni,

   trimethylamine alane complex. The NWs exhibited an average diameter In
   the range from 45 to 85 nm, were crystalline, and did not contain a
   detectable amount of carbon impurities. Atomic layer deposition of 50 nm
   of vanadium oxide on the surface of Al NW allows fabrication of
   supercapacitor electrodes with volumetric capacitance in excess of 1400
   F.cc(-3), which exceeds the capacitance of traditional activated carbon
   supercapacitor electrodes by more than an order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Using a mesoscale computational model, we probe the release of
   nanoparticles and linear macromolecules from hollow microgel capsules
   that swell and deswell in response to external stimuli. Our simulations
   reveal that responsive microcapsules can be effectively utilized for
   steady and pulsatile release of encapsulated solutes. Swollen gel
   capsules allow steady, diffusive release of nanoparticles and polymer
   chains, whereas gel deswelling causes burst-like discharge of solutes
   driven by an outward flow of the solvent enclosed within a shrinking
   capsule. We demonstrate that this hydrodynamic release can be regulated
   by introducing rigid microscopic rods in the capsule interior. Thus, our
   findings disclose an efficient approach for controlled release from
   stimuli-responsive microcarriers that could be useful for designing
   advanced drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Several hundred workers die in construction in the United States every
   year because equipment operators are unable to see their fellow workers
   during operation of their vehicle. In this paper we propose a step
   towards improving this situation by providing an automated method based
   on range imaging for estimating the coarse head orientation of a
   construction equipment operator. This research utilizes
   commercially-available low resolution range cameras to measure the
   continuously changing field-of-view (FOV) of an equipment operator in
   outdoor construction. This paper presents a methodology to measure
   so-called dynamic blind spot maps. The dynamic blind spot map is then
   projected on a known static equipment blind spot map that already exists
   to each construction vehicle. A robust computational coarse head pose
   estimation algorithm and results to three different pieces of
   construction equipment and multiple operators are presented. The
   developed method has the potential in automatically determining the
   spaces around vehicles that are currently not in the field-of-view of
   the vehicle operator thus providing eventually additional means and
   technology for improving safety in construction. Published by Elsevier

   analyzed via UV/Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and
   transmission electron microscopy. Results indicate that nC(60) suspended
   in water interacted with all the solid materials ('clays') studied. The
   LDH, with a net positive surface charge, has the greatest capacity to
   associate with the negatively charged nC(60), capable of adsorbing 18\%
   w/w. Column studies support sorption isotherm data, with LDH retarding
   nC(60) transport >30 times more, in relative terms, than montmorillonite
   or kaolinite. Findings suggest that specific material interactions are
   primarily dominated by available surface area and electrostatic
   interaction at charged surfaces. Intercalation was not observed. These
   results have implications not only for understanding fullerene transport
   in the subsurface, but also towards engineering effective barriers for
   safe storage and disposal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{89-101}},
Abstract = {{This work estimates the primary marine organic aerosol global emission
   source and its impact on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations
   by implementing an organic sea spray source function into a series of
   global aerosol simulations. The source function assumes that a fraction
   of the sea spray emissions, depending on the local chlorophyll
   concentration, is organic matter in place of sea salt. Effect on CCN
   concentrations (at 0.2\% supersaturation) is modeled using the
   Two-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics algorithm coupled to
   the GISS II-prime general circulation model. The presence of organics
   affects CCN activity in competing ways: by reducing the amount of solute
   available in the particle and decreasing surface tension of CCN. To
   model surfactant effects, surface tension depression data from seawater
   samples taken near the Georgia coast were applied as a function of
   carbon concentrations. A global marine organic aerosol emission rate of
   17.7 Tg C yr(-1) is estimated from the simulations. Marine organics
   exert a localized influence on CCN(0.2 \%) concentrations, decreasing
   regional concentrations by no more than 5\% and by less than 0.5\% over
   most of the globe, assuming direct replacement of sea salt aerosol with
   organic aerosol. The decrease in CCN concentrations results from the
   fact that the decrease in particle solute concentration outweighs the
   organic surfactant effects. The low sensitivity of CCN(0.2 \%) to the
   marine organic emissions is likely due to the small compositional
   changes: the mass fraction of OA in accumulation mode aerosol increases
   by only similar to 15\% in a biologically active region of the Southern
   Ocean. To test the sensitivity to uncertainty in the sea spray emissions
   process, we relax the assumption that sea spray aerosol number and mass
   remain fixed and instead can add to sea spray emissions rather than
   replace existing sea salt. In these simulations, we find that marine
   organic aerosol can increase CCN by up to 50\% in the Southern Ocean and
   3.7\% globally during the austral summer. This vast difference in CCN
   impact highlights the need for further observational exploration of the
   sea spray aerosol emission process as well as evaluation and development
   of model parameterizations.}},

Title = {{Attribution and evolution of ozone from Asian wild fires using satellite
   and aircraft measurements during the ARCTAS campaign}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{169-188}},
Abstract = {{We use ozone and carbon monoxide measurements from the Tropospheric
   Emission Spectrometer (TES), model estimates of Ozone, CO, and ozone
   pre-cursors from the Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS), and
   data from the NASA DC8 aircraft to characterize the source and dynamical
   evolution of ozone and CO in Asian wildfire plumes during the spring
   ARCTAS campaign 2008. On the 19 April, NASA DC8 O-3 and aerosol
   Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) observed two biomass burning plumes
   originating from North-Western Asia (Kazakhstan) and South-Eastern Asia
   (Thailand) that advected eastward over the Pacific reaching North
   America in 10 to 12 days. Using both TES observations and RAQMS chemical
   analyses, we track the wildfire plumes from their source to the ARCTAS
   DC8 platform. In addition to photochemical production due to ozone
   pre-cursors, we find that exchange between the stratosphere and the
   troposphere is a major factor influencing O-3 concentrations for both
   plumes. For example, the Kazakhstan and Siberian plumes at 55 degrees
   North is a region of significant springtime stratospheric/tropospheric
   exchange. Stratospheric air influences the Thailand plume after it is
   lofted to high altitudes via the Himalayas. Using comparisons of the
   model to the aircraft and satellite measurements, we estimate that the
   Kazakhstan plume is responsible for increases of O-3 and CO mixing
   ratios by approximately 6.4 ppbv and 38 ppbv in the lower troposphere
   (height of 2 to 6 km), and the Thailand plume is responsible for
   increases of O-3 and CO mixing ratios of approximately 11 ppbv and 71
   ppbv in the upper troposphere (height of 8 to 12 km) respectively.
   However, there are significant sources of uncertainty in these estimates
   that point to the need for future improvements in both model and
   satellite observations. For example, it is challenging to characterize
   the fraction of air parcels from the stratosphere versus those from the
   fire because of the low sensitivity of the TES CO estimates used to mark
   stratospheric air versus air parcels affected by the smoke plume. Model
   transport uncertainties, such as too much dispersion, results in a broad
   plume structure from the Kazakhstan fires that is approximately 2 km
   lower than the plume observed by aircraft. Consequently, the model and
   TES data do not capture the photochemical production of ozone in the
   Kazakhstan plume that is apparent in the aircraft in situ data. However,
   ozone and CO distributions from TES and RAQMS model estimates of the
   Thailand plume are within the uncertainties of the TES data. Therefore,
   the RAQMS model is better able to characterize the emissions from this
   fire, the mixing of ozone from the stratosphere to the plume, and the
   photochemical production and transport of ozone and ozone pre-cursors as
   the plume moves across the Pacific.}},

Abstract = {{We present the development of ANISORROPIA, the discrete adjoint of the

   of an inorganic species in aerosol or gas phase with respect to the
   total concentrations of each species present with less than a two-fold
   increase in computational time over the concentration calculations. Due
   to the highly nonlinear and discontinuous solution surface of ISORROPIA,
   evaluation of the adjoint required a new, complex-variable version of
   the model, which determines first-order sensitivities with machine
   precision and avoids cancellation errors arising from finite difference
   calculations. The adjoint is verified over an atmospherically relevant
   range of concentrations, temperature, and relative humidity. We apply
   ANISORROPIA to recent field campaign results from Atlanta, GA, USA, and
   Mexico City, Mexico, to characterize the inorganic aerosol sensitivities

Abstract = {{Aortic valve (AV) calcification is a highly prevalent disease with
   serious impact on mortality and morbidity. Although exact causes and
   mechanisms of AV calcification are unclear, previous studies suggest
   that mechanical forces play a role. Since calcium deposits occur almost
   exclusively on the aortic surfaces of AV leaflets, it has been
   hypothesized that adverse patterns of fluid shear stress on the aortic
   surface of AV leaflets promote calcification. The current study
   characterizes AV leaflet aortic surface fluid shear stresses using Laser
   Doppler velocimetry and an in vitro pulsatile flow loop. The valve model
   used was a native porcine valve mounted on a suturing ring and preserved
   using 0.15\% glutaraldehyde solution. This valve model was inserted in a
   mounting chamber with sinus geometries, which is made of clear acrylic
   to provide optical access for measurements. To understand the effects of
   hemodynamics on fluid shear stress, shear stress was measured across a
   range of conditions: varying stroke volumes at the same heart rate and
   varying heart rates at the same stroke volume. Systolic shear stress
   magnitude was found to be much higher than diastolic shear stress
   magnitude due to the stronger flow in the sinuses during systole,
   reaching up to 20 dyn/cm(2) at mid-systole. Upon increasing stroke
   volume, fluid shear stresses increased due to stronger sinus fluid
   motion. Upon increasing heart rate, fluid shear stresses decreased due
   to reduced systolic duration that restricted the formation of strong
   sinus flow. Significant changes in the shear stress waveform were
   observed at 90 beats/min, most likely due to altered leaflet dynamics at
   this higher heart rate. Overall, this study represents the most
   well-resolved shear stress measurements to date across a range of
   conditions on the aortic side of the AV. The data presented can be used
   for further investigation to understand AV biological response to shear
   stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Aortic valve (AV) calcification is a highly prevalent disease with
   serious impact on mortality and morbidity. The exact causes and
   mechanisms of AV calcification are unclear, although previous studies
   suggest that mechanical forces play a role. It has been clinically
   demonstrated that calcification preferentially occurs on the aortic
   surface of the AV. This is hypothesized to be due to differences in the
   mechanical environments on the two sides of the valve. It is thus
   necessary to characterize fluid shear forces acting on both sides of the
   leaflet to test this hypothesis. The current study is one of two studies
   characterizing dynamic shear stress on both sides of the AV leaflets. In
   the current study, shear stresses on the ventricular surface of the AV
   leaflets were measured experimentally on two prosthetic AV models with
   transparent leaflets in an in vitro pulsatile flow loop using
   two-component Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). Experimental measurements
   were utilized to validate a theoretical model of AV ventricular surface
   shear stress based on the Womersley profile in a straight tube, with
   corrections for the opening angle of the valve leaflets. This
   theoretical model was applied to in vivo data based on MRI-derived
   volumetric flow rates and valve dimension obtained from the literature.
   Experimental results showed that ventricular surface shear stress was
   dominated by the streamwise component. The systolic shear stress
   waveform resembled a half-sinusoid during systole and peaks at 64-71
   dyn/cm(2), and reversed in direction at the end of systole for 15-25 ms,
   and reached a significant negative magnitude of 40-51 dyn/cm(2). Shear
   stresses from the theoretical model applied to in vivo data showed that
   shear stresses peaked at 77-92 dyn/cm(2) and reversed in direction for
   substantial period of time (108-110 ms) during late systole with peak

Abstract = {{A method of fault detection and classification (FDC) for semiconductor
   manufacturing equipment e-diagnostics using equipment data is presented.
   Detecting faulty processes, identifying any anomaly at their onsets, and
   rapidly classifying the root cause of the fault are crucial for
   maximizing equipment utilization in current semiconductor manufacturing;
   however, tool data acquired from production equipment contains much
   information that is often challenging to analyze due to its sheer volume
   and complexity. In this paper, modular neural network (MNN) modeling is
   presented as a method for fault detection modeling in plasma etching.
   Based on the result from the MNN modeling, a tool data set is grouped
   according to its related subsystems, and FDC is performed using
   Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory to address the uncertainty associated with
   fault diagnosis. Subsystem level fault detections, such as radio
   frequency (RF) power source module, RF power bias module, gas delivery
   module, and process chamber module, are presented by combining related
   parameters, and successful fault detection is achieved. The evidential
   reasoning of RF probe is also beneficial for the detection of chamber
   leak simulation, and the classification of fault is made by further
   investigating voltage signal of RF probe. Successful fault detection in
   subsystem level with zero missed alarms was demonstrated using D-S
   theory of evidential reasoning, and the classification for finding root
   cause of the fault is presented in the chamber leak fault simulation. We
   realized that successful FDC can be accomplished by combining various
   related information and by incorporating engineering expert knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Free-living bacteria with spherical cells 0.5-2.5 mu m in diameter were
   isolated from freshwater sediment. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
   placed the new isolates within the phylum Spirochaetes ('spirochaetes').
   The isolates never displayed a helical morphology or motility. Growth
   occurred in the presence of 100 mg ampicillin l(-1) in complex and
   defined mineral salts medium amended with vitamins, yeast extract and
   monosaccharides, disaccharides or soluble starch as fermentable
   substrates. Two distinct isolates, designated Buddy(T) and Grapes(T),
   exhibited doubling times of 21 +/- 2 and 15 +/- 1 h in glucose-amended
   medium and grew at 15-37 and 15-30 degrees C. Optimum growth was
   observed between 25 and 30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.5, with no growth
   below pH 5 or above pH 10. Hexose and pentose fermentation yielded
   ethanol, acetate and formate as major end products. Growth was strictly
   fermentative and anaerobic, but the isolates tolerated brief oxygen
   exposure. Nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate and carbon dioxide were not used
   as electron acceptors, but soluble Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(II) in
   glucose-amended medium. The DNA G + C base contents of isolates Buddy(T)
   and Grapes(T) were 45.5-46.4 and 47.0-49.2 mol\%, respectively.
   Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles contained large proportions of
   C-14 : 0 and C-16 : 0 straight-chain saturated fatty acids; C-16 : 1
   omega 7c and C-16 : 1 omega 9c dominated the mono-unsaturated PLFAs in
   isolate Grapes(T), whereas isolate Buddy(T) also possessed C-18 : 1
   omega 5C, C-18 : 1 omega 7c and C-18 : 1 omega 9c fatty acids. Branched
   monoenoic acids accounted for up to 12.4 and 30\% of the total PLFA in
   isolates Grapes(T) and Buddy(T), respectively. Based on their unique
   morphological features and the phylogenetic distance from their closest
   relatives, we propose the new genus, Sphaerochaeta gen. nov., to
   accommodate the new isolates within the novel species Sphaerocha eta
   globosa sp. nov. (type strain Buddy(T) = DSM 22777(T) =ATCC BAA-1886(T))
   and Sphaerochaeta pleomorpha sp. nov. (type strain Grapes(T) = DSM
   22778(T) =ATCC BAA-1885(T)). Sphaerochaeta globosa is the type species
   of the genus.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear piezoelectric effects in flexural energy harvesters have
   recently been demonstrated for drive amplitudes well within the scope of
   anticipated vibration environments for power generation. In addition to
   strong softening effects, steady-state oscillations are highly damped as
   well. Nonlinear fluid damping was previously employed to successfully
   model drive dependent decreases in frequency response due to the
   high-velocity oscillations, but this article instead harmonizes with a
   body of literature concerning weakly excited piezoelectric actuators by
   modeling nonlinear damping with nonconservative piezoelectric
   constitutive relations. Thus, material damping is presumed dominant over
   losses due to fluid-structure interactions. Cantilevers consisted of
   lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-5A and PZT-5H are studied, and the
   addition of successively larger proof masses is shown to precipitate
   nonlinear resonances at much lower base excitation thresholds while
   increasing the influence of higher-order nonlinearities. Parameter
   identification results using a multiple scales perturbation solution
   suggest that empirical trends are primarily due to higher-order elastic
   and dissipation nonlinearities and that modeling linear
   electromechanical coupling is sufficient. This article concludes with
   the guidelines for which utilization of a nonlinear model is preferred.}},

Title = {{Quantification of coronary arterial stenoses in CTA using fuzzy distance

Abstract = {{Quantification of coronary arterial stenoses is useful for the diagnosis
   of several coronary heart diseases. Being noninvasive, economical and
   informative, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has become a common
   modality for monitoring disease status and treatment effects. Here, we
   present a new method for detecting and quantifying coronary arterial
   stenosis in CTA using fuzzy distance transform (FDT) approach and a new
   coherence analysis of observed data for computing expected local
   diameter. FDT allows computing local depth at each image point in the
   presence of partial voluming and thus, eliminates the need for
   binarization, commonly, associated with inclusion of additional errors.
   In the current method, coronary arterial stenoses are detected and their
   severities are quantified by analyzing FDT values along the medial axis
   of an arterial tree obtained by its skeletonization. A new skeletal
   pruning algorithm has been developed toward improving the quality of
   medial axes and thereby, enhancing the accuracy of stenosis detection
   and quantification. Further, we have developed a new method to estimate
   ``expected diameter{''} along a given arterial branch using a new
   coherence analysis of observed diameter values along the branch. The
   overall method is completed in the following steps - (1) fuzzy
   segmentation of coronary artery in CTA, (2) FDT computation of coronary
   arteries, (3) medial axis computation, (4) estimation of observed and
   expected diameters along arteries and (5) detection of stenoses and
   quantification of arterial blockage. The performance of this method has
   been quantitatively evaluated on a realistic coronary artery phantom
   dataset with randomly simulated stenoses and the results have been
   compared with a binary distance transform based and a conventional
   binary algorithm. The method has also been applied on a clinical CTA
   dataset from thirteen heart patients and the results have been compared
   with an expert's quantitative assessment of stenoses. Results of the
   phantom experiment indicate that the new method (error: 0.53\%) is
   significantly more accurate as compared to both binary distance
   transform based (error 2.11\%) and conventional binary (error 3.71\%)
   methods. Also, the results of the clinical study indicate that the new
   FDT-based method (kappa coefficient = 87.9\%) is highly in agreement
   with the expert's assessments and, in this respect, outperforms the
   other two methods (kappa coefficients = 75.2\% and 69.5\%). (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Even a small fraction of fine particles can have a significant effect on
   gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments and sediment stability.
   Experiments were conducted to investigate the role of fine particles on
   gas production using a soil chamber that allows for the application of
   an effective stress to the sediment. This chamber was instrumented to
   monitor shear-wave velocity, temperature, pressure, and volume change
   during CO2 hydrate formation and gas production. The instrumented
   chamber was placed inside the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Seafloor
   Process Simulator (SPS), which was used to control the fluid pressure
   and temperature. Experiments were conducted with different sediment
   types and pressure-temperature histories. Fines migrated within the
   sediment in the direction of fluid flow. A vuggy structure formed in the
   sand; these small cavities or vuggs were precursors to the development
   of gas-driven fractures during depressurization under a constant
   effective stress boundary condition. We define the critical fines
   fraction as the clay-to-sand mass ratio when clays fill the pore space
   in the sand. Fines migration, clogging, vugs, and gas-driven fracture
   formation developed even when the fines content was significantly lower
   than the critical fines fraction. These results show the importance of
   fines in gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments, even when the
   fines content is relatively low.}},

Abstract = {{Moisture condensation may cause degradation of key motor components when
   a motor is de-energized. To prevent moisture condensation, a motor's
   temperature must be maintained higher than the ambient temperature when
   de-energized. This paper proposes a nonintrusive motor heating technique
   using soft starters. By controlling the operation of the solid-state
   switches in soft starters, adjustable ac current can be injected into
   the three phases of the stator windings without inducing any output
   torque. The motor temperature can therefore be maintained at a desired
   temperature due to the heat dissipation during current injection. In
   addition, two motor temperature control approaches are proposed in this
   paper to minimize the required energy consumption for preventing
   moisture condensation. The proposed technique is experimentally
   validated on a 7.5-hp ODP (open drip proof) induction motor. The
   experimental results show that the average stator winding temperature
   can reach 9. above the ambient temperature with acceptable current
   magnitudes. In addition, it is shown that the motor temperature rise can
   be controlled by adjusting the operation of the solid-state switches in
   soft starters. The importance of the proposed technique lies in its
   noninvasive nature: the technique only uses the existing hardware of
   soft starters; the motor's condition is not interrupted since no output
   torque is induced during the current injection. The proposed winding
   heating technique can be easily extended to other types of ac machines
   or inverter-fed applications.}},

Abstract = {{While the development of reconfigurable analog platforms is a blossoming
   field, the tradeoff between usability and flexibility continues to be a
   major barrier. Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs) built with
   translinear elements offer a promising solution to this problem. These
   FPAAs can be built to use previously developed synthesis procedures for
   translinear circuits. Furthermore, large-scale translinear FPAAs can be
   built using floating-gate transistors as both the computational elements
   and the reconfigurable interconnect network. An FPAA built using
   Multiple Input Translinear Elements (MITEs) has been designed,
   fabricated in 0.35 mu m CMOS, and tested. These devices have been
   programmed to implement various circuits including multipliers, squaring
   circuits, RMS-to-DC converters, and filters. In addition, synthesis,
   place-and-route, and programming tools have been created in order to
   implement a reconfigurable system where the circuits implemented are
   described only by equations. The continued development of translinear
   FPAAs will lead to a reconfigurable analog system that allows for a
   large portion of the design to be abstracted away from the user.}},

Abstract = {{For multiple-input multiple-output communication systems that employ
   four or more transmit and four or more receive antennas, symbol
   detection remains a challenge in communication systems research.
   Lattice-reduction-aided detectors are attractive solutions to this
   problem because these detectors achieve the same diversity as the
   maximum-likelihood detector while exhibiting lower complexity. Current
   applications of lattice-reduction-aided detectors involve executing a
   lattice reduction algorithm to completion and then utilizing this result
   in the subsequent symbol detection. In this article, however, we examine
   the possibility of partially executing the lattice reduction algorithm.
   We first demonstrate using a hypothetical lattice-reduction-aided
   detector that early termination of lattice reduction algorithms is
   possible in the context of MIMO detection. Encouraged by these results,
   we develop and introduce incremental lattice reduction, which utilizes a
   practical early termination condition. We then apply this idea to
   develop a joint symbol detection and lattice reduction algorithm that is
   based on the Lenstra, Lenstra, Lovasz algorithm and successive
   interference cancellation. An evaluation using a spatial correlation
   channel model demonstrates that the proposed algorithm effectively
   distributes the lattice reduction processing over the length of each
   received packet. This behavior naturally enables the relaxation of
   throughput and latency requirements of lattice reduction algorithm
   hardware realizations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the outage probability of multibranch dual-hop

   combining considering both the effect of co-channel interference (CCI)

   a DF cooperative relaying system is more vulnerable to noise than
   interference for low and moderate SINR, whereas it is more susceptible
   to interference than noise for high SINR and high diversity order.
   Moreover, this paper shows that the robustness of the destination
   against CCI is more important than that of the relay. The results of
   this paper are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Fibronectin (FN) assembles into fibrillar networks by cells through an
   integrin-dependent mechanism. We have recently shown that simple FN
   adsorption onto poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces (PEA), but not control
   polymer (poly(methyl acrylate), PMA), also triggered FN organization
   into a physiological fibrillar network. FN fibrils exhibited enhanced
   biological activities in terms of myogenic differentiation compared to
   individual FN molecules. In the present study, we investigate the
   influence of topological cues on the material-driven FN assembly and the
   myogenic differentiation process. Aligned and random electrospun fibers
   were prepared. While FN fibrils assembled on the PEA fibers as they do
   on the smooth surface, the characteristic distribution of globular FN
   molecules observed on flat PMA transformed into non-connected FN fibrils
   on electrospun PMA, which significantly enhanced cell differentiation.
   The direct relationship between the fibrillar organization of FN at the
   material interface and the myogenic process was further assessed by
   preparing FN gradients on smooth PEA and PMA films. Isolated FN
   molecules observed at one edge of the substrate gradually interconnected
   with each other, eventually forming a fully developed network of FN
   fibrils on PEA. In contrast, FN adopted a globular-like conformation
   along the entire length of the PMA surface, and the FN gradient
   consisted only of increased density of adsorbed FN. Correspondingly, the
   percentage of differentiated cells increased monotonically along the FN
   gradient on PEA but not on PMA. This work demonstrates an interplay
   between material chemistry and topology in modulating material-driven FN
   fibrillogenesis and cell differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The development of low-frequency sonar systems, using, for instance, a
   network of autonomous systems in unmanned vehicles, provides a practical
   means for bistatic measurements (i.e., when the source and receiver are
   widely separated) allowing for multiple viewpoints of the target of
   interest. Time-frequency analysis, in particular, Wigner-Ville analysis,
   takes advantage of the evolution time dependent aspect of the echo
   spectrum to differentiate a man-made target, such as an elastic
   spherical shell, from a natural object of the similar shape. A key
   energetic feature of fluid-loaded and thin spherical shell is the
   coincidence pattern, also referred to as the mid-frequency enhancement
   (MFE), that results from antisymmetric Lamb-waves propagating around the
   circumference of the shell. This article investigates numerically the
   bistatic variations of the MFE with respect to the monostatic
   configuration using the Wigner-Ville analysis. The observed
   time-frequency shifts of the MFE are modeled using a previously derived
   quantitative ray theory by Zhang et al. {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 91,
   1862-1874 (1993)] for spherical shell's scattering. Additionally, the
   advantage of an optimal array beamformer, based on joint time delays and
   frequency shifts is illustrated for enhancing the detection of the MFE
   recorded across a bistatic receiver array when compared to a
   conventional time-delay beamformer. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of

   crossflow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The jet in crossflow problem has been extensively studied, mainly
   because of its application to film cooling and injector design. It has
   been established that in low-speed flow, pulsing the jet significantly
   enhances mixing and jet penetration. This work investigates the effects
   of pulsing of high-speed subsonic jets (Ma similar to 0.47 - 0.77) on
   mixing and jet trajectory in turbulent subsonic crossflows by using
   large-eddy simulation. Jets with different density and momentum ratios
   are pulsed from an injector into a crossflow for a range of Strouhal
   numbers. Results are compared with the earlier low-speed cases to
   determine the sensitivity of jet penetration scaling on the relatively
   high Reynolds and Mach numbers of the current pulsed jets. It is shown
   that the classical momentum-ratio-based scaling (which reduces to the
   velocity ratio scaling in equal density low-speed case) can still be
   used for these high Reynolds and jet Mach number cases, although the
   scaling constant is slightly different. However, when the jet momentum
   ratio is different for the same Strouhal, Reynolds and Mach numbers,
   there is a significant change in the scaling constant, suggesting a
   sensitivity that could impact the original scaling relationship itself.}},

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were prepared by capitalizing on a
   TiO2 bilayer structure composed of P-25 nanoparticles and freestanding
   crystalline nanotube arrays as photoanodes. After being subjected to
   sequential TiCl4 treatment and O-2 plasma exposure, the bilayer
   photoanode was sensitized with N719 dye. DSSCs based on a 20 mu m TiO2
   nanoparticle film solely and a bilayer of 13 mu m TiO2 nanoparticles and
   7 mu m TiO2 nanotubes exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency,
   PCE, of 8.02\% and 7.00\%, respectively, compared to the devices made of
   different TiO2 thicknesses. On the basis of J-V parameter analysis
   acquired by equivalent circuit model simulation, in comparison to P-25
   nanoparticles, charge transport in nanotubes was found to be facilitated
   due to the presence of advantageous nanotubular structures, while
   photocurrent was reduced owing to their small surface area, which in
   turn resulted in low dye loading, as well as the lack of cooperative
   effect of anatase and rutile phases.}},

Title = {{Detection of liquid-metal, free-surface flow using the DLP measurement
   technique}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{179-192}},

Abstract = {{Novel accelerator applications favor free-surface liquid-metal flows, in
   which the liquid acts both as a target producing secondary particles but
   also to remove efficiently the heat deposited. A crucial aspect for the
   operation is the continuous monitoring of both shape and position of the
   liquid's surface. This demands, in a nuclear environment, a
   non-intrusive measurement technique with high temporal and spatial
   resolution. In this context, the double-layer projection (DLP) technique
   based on geometric optics has been developed, allowing one to detect
   either point-wise or area-wise the shape and position of the nearly
   totally reflecting liquid-metal surface. The DLP technique employs a
   laser beam projected through a coplanar glass plate to the surface from
   which it is reflected to the plate again. Beam locations captured by
   means of a camera permit the position and shape of the surface to be
   reconstructed. The parameters affecting the resolution and performance
   of the DLP technique are discussed. Additionally, validation studies
   using static and moving objects of pre-defined shape are conducted,
   exhibiting spatial and temporal resolutions of 300 mu m and 100 Hz,
   respectively. Finally, the DLP system is applied to perform measurements
   of a circular hydraulic jump (CHJ) in a liquid metal. The DLP system has
   proved the capability to measure the jump both qualitatively and
   quantitatively. Additionally, the experiments identified, at high
   Reynolds numbers, the existence of a two-step jump. The analysis of
   spectral data of the DLP surface measurements shows clearly that, at the
   outer radius, gravity waves occur. Also, contributions from the pump
   oscillations were found, demonstrating the high performance of the DLP
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel thermal management is an important consideration in the design and
   operation of modern high performance aircraft. In many cases, fuel is a
   primary heat sink for thermal loads associated with the cooling of the
   airframe as well as propulsion, electronic, actuator, and payload
   systems. It is now common for thermal systems to recirculate warm fuel
   to the tanks, resulting in a rise in temperature of the mission fuel
   mass. This paper presents a model that integrates heat transfer during
   mission segments to determine the thermal endurance of an aircraft in
   terms of fuel tank temperature rise. Cases with and without tank-wall
   heat transfer are considered. The model is intended for early-phase
   trade studies to determine whether a proposed vehicle design will likely
   be restricted in operational performance by tank temperature limits. An
   example is provided to demonstrate the application of the model to
   determine tank temperature rise during a notional aircraft mission.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogel based scaffolds for neural tissue engineering can provide
   appropriate physico-chemical and mechanical properties to support
   neurite extension and facilitate transplantation of cells by acting as
   `cell delivery vehicles'. Specifically, in situ gelling systems such as
   photocrosslinkable hydrogels can potentially conformally fill irregular
   neural tissue defects and serve as stem cell delivery systems. Here, we
   report the development of a novel chitosan based photocrosslinkable
   hydrogel system with tunable mechanical properties and degradation
   rates. A two-step synthesis of amino-ethyl methacrylate derivitized,
   degradable, photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogels is described. When
   human mesenchymal stem cells were cultured in photocrosslinkable
   chitosan hydrogels, negligible cytotoxicity was observed.
   Photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogels facilitated enhanced neurite
   differentiation from primary cortical neurons and enhanced neurite
   extension from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as compared to agarose based
   hydrogels with similar storage moduli. Neural stem cells (NSCs) cultured
   within photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogels facilitated differentiation
   into tubulin positive neurons and astrocytes. These data demonstrate the
   potential of photocrosslinked chitosan hydrogels, and contribute to an
   increasing repertoire of hydrogels designed for neural tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Surface endothelialization is an attractive means to improve the
   performance of small diameter vascular grafts. While endothelial
   outgrowth cells (EOCs) are considered a promising source of autologous
   endothelium, the ability of EOCs to modulate coagulation-related blood
   activities is not well understood. The goal of this study was to assess
   the role of arterial flow conditions on the thrombogenic phenotype of
   EOCs. EOCs derived from baboon peripheral blood, as well as mature
   arterial endothelial cells from baboons, were seeded onto adsorbed
   collagen, then exposed to physiologic levels of fluid shear stress. For
   important hemostatic pathways, cellular responses to shear stress were
   characterized at the gene and protein level and confirmed with a
   functional assay for activated protein C (APC) activity. For EOCs, fluid
   shear stress upregulated gene and protein expression of anticoagulant
   and platelet inhibitory factors, including thrombomodulin, tissue factor
   pathway inhibitor, and nitric oxide synthase 3 (eNOS). Fluid shear
   stress significantly altered the functional activity of EOCs by
   increasing APC levels. This study demonstrates that fluid shear stress
   is an important determinant of EOC hemostatic properties. Accordingly,
   manipulation of EOC phenotype by mechanical forces may be important for
   the development of thrombo-resistant surfaces on engineered vascular
   implants.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) users are expected to be uncoordinated users that
   opportunistically seek the spectrum resource from primary users (PUs) in
   a competitive way. In most existing works, however, CR users are
   required to share the interference channel information and power
   strategies to conduct the game with pricing mechanisms that incur the
   frequent exchange of information. The requirement of significant
   communication overheads among CR users impedes fully distributed
   solutions for the deployment of CR networks, which is a challenging
   problem in the research communities. In this paper, a robust distributed
   power control algorithm is designed with low implementation complexity
   for CR networks through reinforcement learning, which does not require
   the interference channel and power strategy information among CR users
   (and from CR users to PUs). To the best of our knowledge, this research
   provides the solution for the first time for the incomplete-information
   power control game in CR networks. During the repeated game, CR users
   can control their power strategies by observing the interference from
   the feedback signals of PUs and transmission rates obtained in the
   previous step. This procedure allows achieving high spectrum efficiency
   while conforming to the interference constraint of PUs. This constrained
   repeated stochastic game with learning automaton is proved to be
   asymptotically equivalence to the traditional game with complete
   information. The properties of existence, diagonal concavity and
   uniqueness for the game are studied. A Bush-Mosteller reinforcement
   learning procedure is designed for the power control algorithm, and the
   properties of convergence and learning rate of the algorithm are
   analyzed. The performance of the learning-based power control algorithm
   is thoroughly investigated with simulation results, which demonstrates
   the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving variety of
   practical CR network problems for real-world applications.}},

Title = {{Characteristics of laterally vibrating resonant microcantilevers in
   viscous liquid media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The characteristics of microcantilevers vibrating laterally in viscous
   liquid media are investigated and compared to those of similar
   microcantilevers vibrating in the out-of-plane direction. The
   hydrodynamic loading on the vibrating beam is first determined using a
   numerical model. A semi-analytical expression for the hydrodynamic
   forces in terms of the Reynolds number and the aspect ratio (beam
   thickness over beam width) is obtained by introducing a correction
   factor to Stokes' solution for a vibrating plate of infinite area to
   account for the effects of the thickness. The results enable the effects
   of fluid damping and effective fluid mass on the resonant frequency and
   the quality factor (Q) to be investigated as a function of both the
   beam's geometry and liquid medium's properties and compared to
   experimentally determined values given in the literature. The resonant
   frequency and Q are found to be higher for laterally vibrating
   microcantilevers compared to those of similar geometry experiencing
   transverse (out-of-plane) vibration. Compared to transversely vibrating
   beams, the resonant frequency of laterally vibrating beams is shown to
   decrease at a slower rate (with respect to changes in viscosity) in
   media having higher viscosities than water. The theoretical results are
   compared to experimental data obtained for cantilevers completely
   immersed in solutions of varying aqueous percent glycerol. The increases
   in resonant frequency and Q are expected to yield much lower limits of
   detection in liquid-phase chemical sensing applications. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{In many industries, it is often required to transfer objects using
   compliant fingers capable of accommodating a limited range of object
   shapes/sizes without causing damage to the products being handled. This
   paper presents a coupled computational and experimental method in time
   domain to characterize the damping coefficient of a continuum structure,
   particularly, its applications for analyzing the damping effect of a
   highly damped compliant finger on contact-induced forces and stresses.
   With the aid of Rayleigh damping and explicit dynamic finite element
   analysis (FEA), this method relaxes several limitations of commonly used
   damping identification methods (such as log-decrement and half-power
   methods) that are valid for systems with an oscillatory response and
   generally estimate the damping ratio for a lumped parameter model. This
   damping identification method implemented using off-the-shelf commercial
   FEA packages has been validated by comparing results against published
   data; both oscillatory and nonoscillatory responses are considered.
   Along with a detailed discussion on practical issues commonly
   encountered in explicit dynamic FEA for damping identification, the
   effects of damping coefficients on contact between a rotating compliant
   finger and an elliptical object has been numerically investigated and
   experimentally validated. The findings offer a better understanding for
   improving grasper designs for applications where joint-less compliant
   fingers are advantageous. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005270]}},

Abstract = {{We studied a critical size of copper (Cu) clusters where the electronic
   effect and the size effect on the ground state structure become weaker.
   Identification of these transitional clusters thus provides with the
   means to efficiently determine the ground state structure of large
   clusters using density functional theory (DFT). Our work indicated that
   beyond the critical size of the transitional cluster, geometrical
   effects become important, and the putative global minimum structure
   obtained from an empirical method can be used as an initial structure to
   determine the true ground state structure using DFT. Structural
   evolution of ground states was also presented with an increase in the
   cluster size. To investigate low-lying structures of Cu, we used a Monte
   Carlo (MC)-simulated annealing method that employs the
   aggregate-volume-bias MC algorithm. Incorporated in the MC method is an
   embedded atom method potential developed by the authors. This search
   method identified the low-lying structures in an effective manner.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs, have become a major
   focus of molecular biology research because of their diverse genomic
   origin and ability to regulate an array of cellular processes. Although
   the biological functions of miRNA are yet to be fully understood, tissue
   levels of specific miRNAs have been shown to correlate with pathological
   development of disease. Here, we demonstrate that molecular beacons can
   readily distinguish mature-and pre-miRNAs, and reliably quantify miRNA
   expression. We found that molecular beacons with DNA, RNA and combined
   locked nucleic acid (LNA)-DNA backbones can all detect miRNAs of low (<1
   nM) concentrations in vitro, with RNA beacons having the highest
   detection sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that molecular beacons have
   the potential to distinguish miRNAs that have slight variations in their
   nucleotide sequence. These results suggest that the molecular
   beacon-based approach to assess miRNA expression and distinguish mature
   and precursor miRNA species is quite robust, and has the promise for
   assessing miRNA levels in biological samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the dynamic assignment of servers to tasks
   in queueing networks where demand may exceed the capacity for service.
   The objective is to maximize the system throughput. We use fluid limit
   analysis to show that several quantities of interest, namely the maximum
   possible throughput, the maximum throughput for a given arrival rate,
   the minimum arrival rate that will yield a desired feasible throughput,
   and the optimal allocations of servers to classes for a given arrival
   rate and desired throughput, can be computed by solving linear
   programming problems. We develop generalized round-robin policies for
   assigning servers to classes for a given arrival rate and desired
   throughput, and show that our policies achieve the desired throughput as
   long as this throughput is feasible for the arrival rate. We conclude
   with numerical examples that illustrate the points discussed and provide
   insights into the system behavior when the arrival rate deviates from
   the one the system is designed for.}},

Abstract = {{Microsystems must conform to microscale dimensions, store sufficient
   energy to last extended periods, and supply enough power to sustain,
   among others, wireless and sensor functions. Because batteries source
   moderate power with low energy densities, miniaturized devices benefit
   from deriving energy from fuel cells (FCs) and power from Li ions,
   rather than relying on one source and over-sizing it to offset its
   deficiency. This article presents a single-inductor, dual-input,
   dual-output (SIDIDO) charger-supply 0.5-mu m CMOS IC with a nested
   hysteretic-control scheme that draws energy from a FC and conditions
   power to charge a Li ion and supply a 1-V, 1-mA load. The IC dynamically
   adjusts to the load, charging the Li ion with excess power from the FC
   during light loads and supplying power from both the FC and Li ion
   otherwise. The fabricated prototype regulated its output to 1 V within
   2.5\% and responded to rising and falling 0.1-1-mA load dumps within 30
   mu s and 50 mV. The efficiency peaked at 32\% because the load was low
   and the converter operated in continuous (rather than in discontinuous)
   conduction and sensed its inductor current via lossy sense resistors
   (instead of sense FETs) to manage risk and validate functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Water is a common contaminant in a variety of industrial oils and
   petroleum products. Thus, the detection of water in these products is of
   substantial relevance. Hence, this study focuses on quantifying trace
   amounts of water in hydrocarbons using hexane as a model system for
   industrial oils and petroleum matrices via mid-infrared (MIR) evanescent
   field absorption spectroscopy. A silver halide fiberoptic waveguide was
   used to interrogate in situ water-in-hexane emulsions. Either unmodified
   fibers or waveguides surface-modified with polyacrylic acid layers were
   used. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ)
   of water in hexane utilizing tin-crosslinked polyacrylic acid modified
   fibers were 76 and 170 ppm, respectively. Consequently, the IR
   absorption signature of water in hexane is detectable at concentrations
   as low as 10 ppm. The proposed fiberoptic sensing strategy requires a
   single measurement only, requires no sample preparation, and thus has
   potential for the direct in situ detection and monitoring of water in
   industrial oils and petroleum products.}},

Abstract = {{Living organisms are adept in forming inorganic materials (biominerals)
   with unique structures and properties that exceed the capabilities of
   engineered materials. Biomimetic materials syntheses are being developed
   that aim at replicating the advantageous properties of biominerals in
   vitro and endow them with additional functionalities. Recently,
   proof-of-concept was provided for an alternative approach that allows
   for the production of biomineral-based functional materials in vivo. In
   this approach, the cellular machinery for the biosynthesis of
   nano-/micropatterned SiO(2) (silica) structures in diatoms was
   genetically engineered to incorporate a monomeric, cofactor-independent
   ({''}simple{''}) enzyme, HabB, into diatom silica. In the present work,
   it is demonstrated that this approach is also applicable for enzymes
   with ``complex{''} activity requirements, including oligomerization,
   metal ions, organic redox cofactors, and posttranslational
   modifications. Functional expression of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase,
   glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase in the
   diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was accomplished, and 66 to 78\% of the
   expressed enzymes were stably incorporated into the biosilica. The in
   vivo incorporated enzymes represent approximately 0.1\% (wt/wt) of the
   diatom biosilica and are stabilized against denaturation and proteolytic
   degradation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the gene construct for
   in vivo immobilization of glucose oxidase can be utilized as the first
   negative selection marker for diatom genetic engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrin is an attractive material for regenerative medicine applications.
   It not only forms a polymer but also contains cryptic matrikines that
   are released upon its activation/degradation and enhance the
   regenerative process. Despite this advantageous biology associated with
   fibrin, commercially available systems (e.g. TISSEEL) display limited
   regenerative capacity. This limitation is in part due to formulations
   that are optimized for tissue sealant applications and result in dense
   fibrous networks that limit cell infiltration. Recent evidence suggests
   that polymerization knob `B' engagement of polymerization hole `b'
   activates an alternative polymerization mechanism in fibrin, which may
   result in altered single fiber mechanical properties. We hypothesized
   that augmenting fibrin polymerization through the addition of PEGylated
   knob peptides with specificity to hole `b' (AHRPYAAC-PEG) would result
   in distinct fibrin polymer architectures with grossly different physical
   properties. Polymerization dynamics, polymer architecture, diffusivity,
   viscoelasticity, and degradation dynamics were analyzed. Results
   indicate that specific engagement of hole `b' with PEGylated knob `B'
   conjugates during polymerization significantly enhances the porosity of
   and subsequent diffusivity through fibrin polymers. Paradoxically, these
   polymers also display increased viscoelastic properties and decreased
   susceptibility to degradation. As a result, fibrin polymer strength was
   significantly augmented without any adverse effects on angiogenesis
   within the modified polymers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the dependence of temperature coefficient of

   silicon bulk acoustic resonators (SiBARs) using both boron and aluminum
   dopants. The native TCF of -33 ppm/degrees C for silicon resistivity of
   > 10(3) Omega . cm is shown to reduce to -1.5 ppm/degrees C at ultralow
   resistivity of similar to 10(-4) Omega . cm using relatively slow
   diffusion-based boron doping. However, the faster thermomigration-based
   aluminum doping offers TCF reduction to as low as -2.7 ppm/degrees C
   with much reduced processing time. A very high Q of 28 000 at 100 MHz is
   measured for a temperature-compensated SiBAR.}},

Abstract = {{For economic reasons, most digital cameras use color filter arrays
   instead of beam splitters to capture image data. As a result of this,
   only one of the required three color samples becomes available at each
   pixel location and the other two need to be interpolated. This process
   is called Color Filter Array (CFA) interpolation or demosaicing. Many
   demosaicing algorithms have been introduced over the years to improve
   subjective and objective interpolation quality. We propose an
   orientation-free edge strength filter and apply it to the demosaicing
   problem. Edge strength filter output is utilized both to improve the
   initial green channel interpolation and to apply the constant color
   difference rule adaptively. This simple edge directed method yields
   visually pleasing results with high CPSNR.}},

Abstract = {{To predistort the signal of an analog-predistortion power amplifier
   system, this paper proposes a variable gain amplifier (VGA) topology
   that gives an optimized linearity and bandwidth performance while having
   a continuous, linear-in-decibel gain control curve. The design employs a
   self-biased differential amplifier with a dynamic current source to
   provide gain and linearity. The overall VGA gain is then controlled by a
   highly linear variable attenuator connected at the output of the
   amplifier. This separated controlling stage allows the VGA to have a
   continuous and linear-in-decibel gain curve without sacrificing the
   bandwidth and linearity of its amplifier stage. A VGA designed with such
   topology has been fabricated in a standard 0.18-mu m CMOS technology.
   Targeted for wideband code-division multiple-access applications, the
   VGA has a maximum gain tuning range from -13.5 to 13.5 dB, a bandwidth
   better than 1.8 GHz (380 MHz to 2.2 GHz), and a worst case input P(1dB)
   better than -5 and -3.6 dBm, respectively, at 850 MHz and 1.95 GHz. The
   post-attenuated structure also gives the VGA a noise figure as low as of
   4.9 dB at 1.95 GHz. To our knowledge, the design demonstrates the best
   linearity performance and has other characteristics that are equivalent
   with other VGAs.}},

Abstract = {{We have employed the laser flash photolysisresonance fluorescence
   technique to investigate the gas-phase kinetics of elementary steps in
   the Br-initiated oxidation of 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene (TME) under
   atmospheric conditions. At T >= 274 K, measured rate coefficients are
   independent of pressure suggesting hydrogen abstraction as the dominant
   pathway. The following Arrhenius expression adequately describes all
   kinetic data at 274 K <= T <= 420 K: k1a(T) = (3.84 +/- 0.84) x 10- 11
   exp{[}(-169 +/- 61)/T] cm3 molecule-1s-1 (uncertainties are 2s,
   precision only). At 203 K <= T <= 241 K, kinetic evidence for reversible
   addition, Br + TME <-> Br-TME (k1b, k-1b), is observed. Analysis of the
   approach to equilibrium data allows evaluation of the rate coefficients
   k1b and k-1b. At atmospheric pressure addition of Br to TME occurs at a
   near gas kinetic rate. Equilibrium constants are obtained from k1b/k-1b.
   Combining the experimental results with electronic structure
   calculations allows third-law analyses of the equilibrium data. The
   following thermochemical parameters for the addition reaction (1b) at 0
   and 298 K are obtained (standard state = 1 atm): Delta(r)H0= -47.1 +/-
   3.0 kJ mol-1, Delta(r)H298=-47.3 +/- 3.0 kJ mol-1, and
   Delta(r)S298=-101.5 +/- 10.0 J mol-1 K-1. Examination of the effect of
   added O2 on Br atom kinetics under conditions where reversible adduct
   formation is observed allows determination of the rate coefficient for
   the BrTME + O2 reaction (k2). At 223 K, we find that k2 increases from
   3.9 to 5.5 x 10-12 cm3 molecule-1s-1 as pressure increases from 25 to
   200 Torr. Our results suggest that under most atmospheric conditions the
   BrTME reaction with O2 occurs more rapidly than the BrTME unimolecular
   decomposition. Hence, the fast addition reaction appears to control the
   rate of TME loss by reaction with Br in the atmosphere. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Covered stents may be able to prevent both thrombosis and restenosis,
   but new mechanically suitable and biocompatible materials are needed
   before this treatment option can become a reality. Hydrophilic polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) cryogels have desirable mechanical properties for covered
   stent membranes and may be able to provide a physical barrier to
   restenosis with low thrombogenicity. An in vitro flow loop with porcine
   blood was used to compare thrombus formation on different
   blood-contacting biomaterials. PVA cryogels were found to maintain blood
   flow with low thrombogenicity and were significantly less thrombogenic
   than polyester (p < 0.05). The ability to prevent hyperplasic in-growth
   was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber cellular migration assay.
   PVA cryogel membranes used as a physical barrier were found to nearly
   eliminate cellular migration (p < 0.05) without cellular toxicity.
   Overall, this article demonstrates pivotal feasibility results for a
   covered stent membrane material that could prevent restenosis by means
   of a hydrogel barrier with low thrombogenicity. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{In hematologic diseases, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and hemolytic

   cells, endothelial cells, and soluble factors lead to microvascular
   occlusion and thrombosis. Here, we report an in vitro
   ``endothelialized{''} microfluidic microvasculature model that
   recapitulates and integrates this ensemble of pathophysiological
   processes. Under controlled flow conditions, the model enabled
   quantitative investigation of how biophysical alterations in hematologic
   disease collectively lead to microvascular occlusion and thrombosis.
   Using blood samples from patients with SCD, we investigated how the drug
   hydroxyurea quantitatively affects microvascular obstruction in SCD, an
   unresolved issue pivotal to understanding its clinical efficacy in such
   patients. In addition, we demonstrated that our microsystem can function
   as an in vitro model of HUS and showed that shear stress influences
   microvascular thrombosis/obstruction and the efficacy of the drug
   eptifibatide, which decreases platelet aggregation, in the context of
   HUS. These experiments establish the versatility and clinical relevance
   of our microvasculature-on-a-chip model as a biophysical assay of
   hematologic pathophysiology as well as a drug discovery platform.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a qualitative equivalence between the electrical
   percolation threshold and the effective thermal conductivity of
   composites filled with cylindrical nanofillers has been recognized. The
   two properties are qualitatively compared on a wide range of aspect
   ratios, from thin nanoplatelets to long nanotubes. Statistical continuum
   theory of strong-contrast is utilized to estimate the thermal
   conductivity of this type of heterogeneous medium, while the percolation
   threshold is simultaneously evaluated using the Monte Carlo simulations.
   Statistical two-point probability distribution functions are used as
   microstructure descriptors for implementing the statistical continuum
   approach. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for calculating the
   two-point correlation functions of computer generated microstructures.
   Finally, the similarities between the effective conductivity properties
   and percolation threshold are discussed. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005410]}},
