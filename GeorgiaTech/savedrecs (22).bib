Abstract = {{A novel nonlinear mirror structure is presented. A 23 nm-thick Au thin
   film separated from a 100 nm-thick Ag film by a dielectric spacer is
   used to drive the nonlinear optical response of the mirror. The linear
   and nonlinear optical properties of the mirror can be tuned by
   optimizing its layer thickness distribution. A figure-of-merit for the
   change in reflectance is derived for the nonlinear mirror and the
   nonlinear refractive index change of the Au layer is shown to be
   significantly enhanced in the mirror structure. The ultrafast
   reflectance change of the nonlinear mirror, studied using femtosecond
   white-light continuum pump-probe experiments, shows an extremely large
   magnitude and is both spectrally and angularly broad in the visible
   range. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{A nanogenerator as a self-powered sensor for measuring the vibration
   spectrum of a drum membrane}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{A nanogenerator (NG) is a device that converts vibration energy into
   electricity. Here, a flexible, small size and lightweight NG is
   successfully demonstrated as an active sensor for detecting the
   vibration spectrum of a drum membrane without the use of an external
   power source. The output current/voltage signal of the NG is a direct
   measure of the strain of the local vibrating drum membrane that contains
   rich informational content, such as, notably, the vibration frequency,
   vibration speed and vibration amplitude. In comparison to the laser
   vibrometer, which is excessively complex and expensive, this kind of
   small and low cost sensor based on an NG is also capable of detecting
   the local vibration frequency of a drum membrane accurately. A spatial
   arrangement of the NGs on the membrane can provide position-dependent
   vibration information on the surface. The measured frequency spectrum
   can be understood on the basis of the theoretically calculated vibration
   modes. This work expands the application of NGs and reveals the
   potential for developing sound wave detection,
   environmental/infrastructure monitoring and many more applications.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient photocatalytic water-splitting systems require stable
   photocatalysts that have photocatalytic activity with repeated
   consecutive use. This study investigated H-2 production under visible
   light irradiation with an Ru/(CuAg)(0.15)In0.3Zn1.4S2 photocatalyst and
   KI as an electron donor. In addition, the stability and reusability of
   the catalyst were evaluated over multiple cycles of H-2 production and
   catalyst regeneration. The results show that sintering temperature
   influenced the crystallinity and photocatalytic activity, as indicated
   by the X-ray diffraction analyses and H-2 production rates. In
   particular, the catalyst sintered at 873 K yielded the highest quantum
   yield of 4.6\% at 420 +/- 5 nm of wavelength. After seven consecutive
   reaction cycles, the quantum yield decreased from 4.6\% to 3.0\% at the
   end of the seventh cycle. The decrease probably occurred because (1)
   particles of the catalyst underwent pronounced aggregation, which led to
   the increase in particle size; and (2) a release of significant metal
   ions was observed during H-2 production, which led to a loss of the
   catalyst mass and potential changes in the photocatalytic activity. This
   study will help facilitate a search of stable photocatalysts for water
   splitting. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Title = {{Synthesis of Ag Nanocubes 18-32 nm in Edge Length: The Effects of Polyol
   on Reduction Kinetics, Size Control, and Reproducibility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a robust method for the facile synthesis of small
   Ag nanocubes with edge lengths controlled in the range of 18-32 nm. The
   success of this new method relies on the substitution of ethylene glycol
   (EG)-the solvent most commonly used in a polyol synthesis-with
   diethylene glycol (DEG). Owing to the increase in hydrocarbon chain
   length, DEG possesses a higher viscosity and a lower reducing power
   relative to EG. As a result, we were able to achieve a nucleation burst
   in the early stage to generate a large number of seeds and a relatively
   slow growth rate thereafter; both factors were critical to the formation
   of Ag nanocubes with small sizes and in high purity (>95\%). The edge
   length of the Ag nanocubes could be easily tailored in the range of
   18-32 nm by quenching the reaction at different time points. For the
   first time, we were able to produce uniform sub-20 nm Ag nanocubes in a
   hydrophilic medium and on a scale of similar to 20 mg per batch. It is
   also worth pointing out that the present protocol was remarkably robust,
   showing good reproducibility between different batches and even for DEGs
   obtained from different vendors. Our results suggest that the high
   sensitivity of synthesis outcomes to the trace amounts of impurities in
   a polyol, a major issue for reproducibility and scale up synthesis, did
   not exist in the present system.}},

Title = {{Splash-cup plants accelerate raindrops to disperse seeds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{79}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{The conical flowers of splash-cup plants Chrysosplenium and Mazus catch
   raindrops opportunistically, exploiting the subsequent splash to
   disperse their seeds. In this combined experimental and theoretical
   study, we elucidate their mechanism for maximizing dispersal distance.
   We fabricate conical plant mimics using three-dimensional printing, and
   use high-speed video to visualize splash profiles and seed travel
   distance. Drop impacts that strike the cup off-centre achieve the
   largest dispersal distances of up to 1 m. Such distances are achieved
   because splash speeds are three to five times faster than incoming drop
   speeds, and so faster than the traditionally studied splashes occurring
   upon horizontal surfaces. This anomalous splash speed is because of the
   superposition of two components of momentum, one associated with a
   component of the drop's motion parallel to the splash-cup surface, and
   the other associated with film spreading induced by impact with the
   splash-cup. Our model incorporating these effects predicts the observed
   dispersal distance within 6-18\% error. According to our experiments,
   the optimal cone angle for the splash-cup is 408, a value consistent
   with the average of five species of splash-cup plants. This optimal
   angle arises from the competing effects of velocity amplification and
   projectile launching angle.}},

Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Hollow fiber sorbents are pseudo-monolithic separations materials
   created with fiber spinning technology using a polymer `binder',
   impregnated with high loadings of sorbent `fillers' {[}1]. To increase
   purified gas recovery during the sorption step and to ensure consistent
   sorption capacity over repeated cycles, a dense, thin polymer barrier
   layer on the fiber sorbents is needed to allow only thermal interactions
   between the sorbate loaded layer and the thermal regeneration fluid.
   This paper considers materials and methods to create delamination-free
   dual layer fiber sorbents, with a porous core and a barrier sheath layer
   formed using a simultaneous co-extrusion process. Low permeability
   polymers were screened for sheath layer creation, with the core layer
   comprising cellulose acetate polymer as binder and zeolite NaY as
   sorbent fillers. Appropriate core and sheath layer dope compositions
   were determined by the cloud-point method and rheology measurements. The
   morphology of the as-spun fibers was characterized in detail by SEM, EDX
   and gas permeation analysis. A simplified qualitative model is described
   to explain the observed fiber morphology. The effects of core, sheath
   spin dope and bore fluid compositions, spinning process parameters such
   as air-gap height, spin dope and coagulation bath temperatures, and
   elongation draw ratio are examined in detail. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We report the pH-controlled surface behavior of amphiphilic
   PSn(P2VP-b-PAA)(n) heteroarm star block terpolymers, (n = number of
   arms, 9 and 22), bearing amphoteric diblock arms with varying polyvalent
   ionic charges (i.e. negative, positive, and zwitterionic) at the air
   water and air solid interfaces. We investigated the assembly of these
   pH-sensitive star terpolymers in Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett
   monolayers under different pH conditions of the subphase. The pi-A
   isotherms acquired at variable pH conditions revealed a distinct
   aggregation behavior of surface micelles which is dependent on the
   ionization of the polyelectrolyte blocks and the number of arms. The
   star block copolymer with a small number of arms (n = 9) was found to
   exhibit a strong pH-dependent phase transformation under compression.
   The pH responsive (zwitterionic) behavior results in changes in surface
   morphologies from circular micelles to complex labyrinth structures. In
   contrast, star polymers with a larger number of arms (22) and a crowded
   branched architecture show stable circular domain morphology without the
   internal reorganization under variable conditions. The observed variety
   of surface behaviors is attributed to the fine balance of intra
   molecular interactions caused by the highly branched chain architecture
   composed of both acidic and basic blocks. This study proposes a novel
   strategy for pH induced tunable surface assembly of responsive ultrathin
   films with multicompartments. We indeed demonstrated that the enhanced
   responsiveness of star polymers to wide pH range and their diverse
   morphology at the interface is enabled by coupling amphoteric concept
   and tailored molecular architecture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel method is developed for grafting multiwall carbon nanotubes
   (MWNTs) onto the surface of polyacrylonitrile-based high strength
   (T300GB) carbon fiber. Functionalized MWNTs were well dispersed in the
   PVA solution and the carbon fiber was dip-coated in this solution. After
   heat treatment of the coated carbon fiber under a nitrogen atmosphere,
   MWNTs with carboxyl groups were grafted onto the functionalized carbon
   fiber via chemical interaction. The resulting materials were
   characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
   Raman spectrum and mechanical testing. FESEM observations revealed
   uniform coverage of carbon nanotubes on carbon fiber. The carbon fiber
   grafted with MWNTs improved the tensile strength by 12\% with respect to
   the pristine carbon fiber. These results are supportive of good
   interfacial bonding between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon
   fiber. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 127:

Abstract = {{The mitral valve is a complex apparatus with multiple constituents that
   work cohesively to ensure unidirectional flow between the left atrium
   and ventricle. Disruption to any or all of the components-the annulus,
   leaflets, chordae, and papillary muscles-can lead to backflow of blood,
   or regurgitation, into the left atrium, which deleteriously effects
   patient health. Through the years, a myriad of surgical repairs have
   been proposed; however, a careful appreciation for the underlying
   structural mechanics can help optimize long-term repair durability and
   inform medical device design. In this review, we aim to present the
   experimental methods and significant results that have shaped the
   current understanding of mitral valve mechanics. Data will be presented
   for all components of the mitral valve apparatus in control,
   pathological, and repaired conditions from human, animal, and in vitro
   studies. Finally, current strategies of patient specific and noninvasive
   surgical planning will be critically outlined.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Miniaturized flow systems have been developed for various applications,
   including integrated chemical analyses and thermal management of
   microelectronics. Understanding interfacial transport is important in
   designing and optimizing such flow systems, since surface effects become
   significant due to the large surface areas and small volumes at these
   length scales. Recently, various near-wall flow diagnostic techniques
   have been developed based on evanescent-wave illumination. Since
   evanescent waves only illuminate the fluid in the region over the first
   few hundred nanometers next to the wall, these techniques have much
   better spatial resolution than conventional methods based on
   epifluorescence microscopy. This paper presents recent advances in
   evanescent wave-based flow diagnostics using fluorescent tracers,
   including evanescent-wave particle velocimetry applied to flows driven
   by both pressure and voltage gradients and evanescent-wave fluorescence,
   which has been used to measure near-wall liquid temperature and pH
   fields, as well as the surface charge, or wall zeta-potential,
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{To test a biorefinery concept, the non-wood biomass of Eulaliopsis
   binata was treated with dilute acid prior to dissolving pulp production
   at 160 degrees C for 30 min. The pretreatment liquor (PL) contained
   42.04 g/L sugars, of which 81.46\% was xylose and only 2.91\% was
   glucose. Furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural in PL were 0.37\% and
   0.06\%, respectively. Chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates
   could be omitted when producing bioethanol with PL because 87.32\% of
   the total sugars were in the form of monosaccharides. Membrane
   filtration with a molecular-weight cut-off of 100 Da was employed to
   concentrate the sugars and a concentration of 170.49 g/L was achieved. A
   method of zero release of the PL is proposed, which consists of ethanol
   production from the concentrated PL and recycling the permeate stream
   into the pretreatment process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine the effects of chondrogenic
   predifferentiation on the ability of bone marrow-derived stromal cells
   (BMSCs) delivered to growth plate defects to restore growth function.
   Chondrogenesis was induced with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1
   treatment in high-density monolayer cultures of BMSCs in vitro. The
   predifferentiated or undifferentiated BMSCs were either seeded into
   agarose gels for continued in vitro culture, or injected into growth
   plate defects via an in situ gelling agarose. Predifferentiated BMSCs
   had higher Sox-9, type II collagen, and aggrecan mRNA levels compared to
   undifferentiated cells after high-density monolayer culture. After
   transfer to agarose gels, predifferentiated cells did not produce a
   cartilaginous matrix, even with continued TGF-beta 1 stimulation,
   whereas undifferentiated cells produced a cartilaginous matrix in this
   system. Three-dimensional images of the growth plate created from
   microcomputed tomography scans showed that delivery of either
   predifferentiated or undifferentiated cells to defects resulted in a
   decrease in mineralized tether formation (fusion) in the growth plate
   tissue surrounding the defect to normal levels. Limb length discrepancy
   between injured and control limbs was corrected after treatment with
   undifferentiated, but not predifferentiated, cells. These results
   indicate that cell therapy may be an effective treatment to reduce
   growth dysfunction after growth plate injury, perhaps by maintaining the
   health of the uninjured growth plate tissue, and that the cell
   differentiation state plays a role in restoring the growth potential of
   the injured limb.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible force sensors are important
   components in medical robotics, as they enable force feedback in a
   challenging environment for surgical and assistive robots. This paper
   analyzes a novel MRI compatible force sensor comprised of a displacement
   amplifying compliant mechanism (DACM) made up of polymers. Hysteresis is
   an inevitable problem for sensors made up of polymers, which reduces the
   precision in measurements. Displacement amplification affects both the
   sensitivity and hysteresis error of a sensor, yet does not ensure an
   improvement in either of them. Optimization methods based solely on
   amplification ratio or sensitivity may be ineffective on reducing the
   hysteresis issue and result in a design with insufficient
   signal-to-noise ratio. Unlike previous works that are focused on
   optimizing topologies with regard to a specific objective function; this
   paper presents an analysis that accounts for both sensitivity and
   hysteresis. An iterative method capable of performing nonlinear analysis
   is established in order to monitor sensitivity and hysteresis error of
   the proposed sensor topology and find out how those are affected by the
   amplification. Optimal configurations for sensitivity and precision are
   deduced and the predictions made by the analysis are confirmed by
   experiments. This paper indicated that sensitivity of a compliant
   mechanism could be traded for a lower hysteresis error i.e., higher
   precision. DACMs could be targeted to achieve a low hysteresis error
   rather than improving the sensitivity in a sensor. Compared to a
   nonamplifying, basis structure of our proposed design achieved a 3-4
   times higher SNR, mostly due to its higher precision.}},

Abstract = {{A growing trend in engineering and science is to use multiple computer
   codes with different levels of accuracy to study the same complex
   system. We propose a framework for sequential design and analysis of a
   pair of high-accuracy and low-accuracy computer codes. It first runs the
   two codes with a pair of nested Latin hypercube designs (NLHDs). Data
   from the initial experiment are used to fit a prediction model. If the
   accuracy of the fitted model is less than a prespecified threshold, the
   two codes are evaluated again with input values chosen in an elaborate
   fashion so that their expanded scenario sets still form a pair of NLHDs.
   The nested relationship between the two scenario sets makes it easier to
   model and calibrate the difference between the two sources. If
   necessary, this augmentation process can be repeated a number of times
   until the prediction model based on all available data has reasonable
   accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with
   several examples. Matlab codes are provided in the online supplement to
   this article.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates user cooperation diversity systems with
   decode-and-forward (DF) selection relaying over nonidentical shadowed
   Nakagami/shadowed Nakagami channels in cellular networks. The outage
   probability and the system spectral efficiency are evaluated as a
   function of a cochannel reuse factor and compared with multireceive (Rx)
   antenna systems for omnidirectional and sectorized cells in both the
   uplink and the downlink. The results of this paper show that the system
   spectral efficiency of the proposed system shows comparable performance
   with that of the single-Rx antenna system, and the outage probability of
   the system outperforms that of the dual-Rx antenna system in a
   particular region of the cell with respect to the relay location. The
   particular region shows that the DF cooperative diversity provides
   better performance in the uplink than in the downlink, but unlike in the
   downlink, the impact of cochannel interference (CCI) on the relay in the
   uplink degrades system performance, in spite of the cell sectorization.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{RNA-seq has proven to be a powerful technique for transcriptome
   profiling based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.
   However, due to the short length of NGS reads, it is challenging to
   accurately map RNA-seq reads to splice junctions (SJs), which is a
   critically important step in the analysis of alternative splicing (AS)
   and isoform construction. In this article, we describe a new method,
   called TrueSight, which for the first time combines RNA-seq read mapping
   quality and coding potential of genomic sequences into a unified model.
   The model is further utilized in a machine-learning approach to
   precisely identify SJs. Both simulations and real data evaluations
   showed that TrueSight achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than
   other methods. We applied TrueSight to new high coverage honey bee
   RNA-seq data to discover novel splice forms. We found that 60.3\% of
   honey bee multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced. By utilizing gene
   models improved by TrueSight, we characterized AS types in honey bee
   transcriptome. We believe that TrueSight will be highly useful to
   comprehensively study the biology of alternative splicing.}},

Abstract = {{Six obligately anaerobic bacterial isolates (195(T), CBDB1, BAV1, VS,
   FL2 and GT) with strictly organohalide-respiring metabolisms were
   obtained from chlorinated solvent-contaminated aquifers, contaminated
   and uncontaminated river sediments or anoxic digester sludge. Cells were
   non-motile with a disc-shaped morphology, 0.3-1 mu m in diameter and
   0.1-0.2 mu m thick, and characteristic indentations on opposite flat
   sides of the cell. Growth occurred in completely synthetic, reduced
   medium amended with a haloorganic electron acceptor (mostly chlorinated
   but also some brominated compounds), hydrogen as electron donor, acetate
   as carbon source, and vitamins. No other growth-supporting redox couples
   were identified. Aqueous hydrogen consumption threshold concentrations
   were <1 nM. Growth ceased when vitamin B-12 was omitted from the medium.
   Addition of sterile cell-free supernatant of Dehalococcoides-containing
   enrichment cultures enhanced dechlorination and growth of strains 195
   and FL2, suggesting the existence of so-far unidentified stimulants.
   Dechlorination occurred between pH 6.5 and 8.0 and over a temperature
   range of 15-35 degrees C, with an optimum growth temperature between 25
   and 30 C. The major phospholipid fatty acids were 14 :0 (15.7 mol\%),
   br15 : 0 (6.2 mol\%), 16 :0 (22.7 mol\%), 10-methyl 16 :0 (25.8 mol\%)
   and 18 :0 (16.6 mol\%). Unusual furan fatty acids including
   9-(5-pentyl-2-furyl)-nonanoate and 8-(5-hexyl-2-furyl)-octanoate were
   detected in strains FL2, BAV1 and GT, but not in strains 195(T) and
   CBDB1. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the six isolates shared more than
   98\% identity, and phylogenetic analysis revealed an affiliation with
   the phylum Chloroflexi and more than 10\% sequence divergence from other
   described isolates. The genome sizes and G+C contents ranged from 1.34
   to 1.47 Mbp and 47 to 48.9 mol\% G+C, respectively. Based on 16S rRNA
   gene sequence comparisons, genome-wide average nucleotide identity and
   phenotypic characteristics, the organohalide-respiring isolates
   represent a new genus and species, for which the name Dehalococcoides
   mccartyi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. Isolates BAV1 (=ATCC BAA-2100
   =JCM 16839 =KCTC 5957), FL2 (=ATCC BAA-2098 =DSM 23585 =JCM 16840 =KCTC
   5959), GT (=ATCC BAA-2099 =1CM 16841 =KCTC 5958), CBDB1, 195(T) (=ATCC
   BAA-2266(T) =KCTC 15142T) and VS are considered strains of
   Dehalococcoides mccartyi, with strain 195T as the type strain. The new
   class Dehalococcoidia classis nov., order Dehalococcoidales ord. nov.
   and family Dehalococcoidaceae fam. nov. are described to accommodate the
   new taxon.}},

Abstract = {{We measure the infrared spectra of polyethylene nanostructures of height
   15 nm using atomic force microscope infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR),
   which is about an order of magnitude improvement over state of the art.
   In AFM-IR, infrared light incident upon a sample induces photothermal
   expansion, which is measured by an AFM tip. The thermomechanical
   response of the sample-tip-cantilever system results in cantilever
   vibrations that vary in time and frequency. A time-frequency domain
   analysis of the cantilever vibration signal reveals how sample
   thermomechanical response and cantilever dynamics affect the AFM-IR
   signal. By appropriately filtering the cantilever vibration signal in
   both the time domain and the frequency domain, it is possible to measure
   infrared absorption spectra on polyethylene nanostructures as small as
   15 nm. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The absorption coefficient of single-crystal silicon is very important
   for applications in semiconductor processing and solar cells. However,
   large discrepancies exist in the literature about the absorption
   coefficient of silicon, especially in the visible and near-infrared
   region. Most existing review articles lack mutual comparison, and some
   are out of date. Due to the difficulties in accurate determination of
   the Si absorption coefficient in this region, additional measurements
   are deemed necessary. In the present study, room-temperature absorption
   coefficients of Si are obtained from transmittance measurements of
   ultrathin wafers down to thickness, at wavelengths from 500 nm to 1000
   nm, using an integrating sphere and a monochromator. Furthermore, a
   systematic survey of available references and detailed intercomparison
   of existing results are performed, resulting in a critical assessment of
   the previous and current measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The fate and effect of the antimicrobial compounds benzalkonium
   chlorides (BACs) on the biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes for
   a continuous-flow, three-stage laboratory-scale BNR system were modeled.
   Three kinetic sub-models, corresponding to each reactor, were developed
   and then combined in a comprehensive ASM1-based model. Kinetic
   parameters for the three sub-models were evaluated using experimental
   data obtained from independent batch assays. The biodegradation of BACs
   was modeled with a mixed-substrate Monod equation. The inhibitory effect
   of BACs on the utilization of degradable COD and denitrification was
   modeled as competitive inhibition, whereas non-competitive inhibition
   was used to model the effect of BACs on nitrification and inhibition
   coefficients were evaluated. The model simulated well the long-term
   performance of the BNR system treating a poultry processing waste-water
   with and without BACs. Enhanced BAC degradation by heterotrophs and
   increased resistance of nitrifiers to BACs, reflecting
   acclimation/enrichment over time, is a salient feature of the model. (C)

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Two established delignification methods employing sodium chlorite-acetic
   acid (SC/AA) and peracetic acid (PAA) are often used, and are reportedly
   highly selective. However, these reports are mostly for highly
   recalcitrant and unpretreated softwoods and hardwoods species, and
   information for less recalcitrant lignocellulosic feedstocks and
   pretreated biomass is scarce. Furthermore, the effects on cellulose
   structure are not documented. Thus, in this study, delignification
   kinetics and selectivity were evaluated when SC/AA and PM were applied
   to untreated switchgrass, poplar, corn stover, and pine sawdust; poplar
   subjected to AFEX, controlled pH, lime, and SO2 pretreatments; and the
   cellulose model compounds. Both methods proved effective in removing
   >90\% lignin, but selectivity for lignin and carbohydrates removal was
   substrate and pretreatment dependent. For untreated biomass, PAA was
   more selective in removing lignin than SC/AA; however, both methods were
   less selective for pretreated solids. Cellulose characterizations
   revealed that PAA had less pronounced impacts on cellulose structure.

Abstract = {{A mixed ionic and electronic conductor, BaPr0.8In0.2O3 - delta (BPI),
   was synthesized and examined as a cathode material for proton-conducting

   cathode exhibited excellent electrochemical performances, demonstrating
   a peak power density of similar to 688 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C.
   Furthermore, the cells with a BPI cathode showed very stable power
   output at a cell voltage of 0.7 V at 600 degrees C over 100 h,
   suggesting that BPI is a promising alternative cathode for H-SOFCs. (c)

Journal = {{EPL}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a study on the nonlinear dynamics of small long-wave
   disturbances to the laminar state in non-rotating axisymmetric
   Poiseuille pipe flows. At high Reynolds numbers, the associated
   Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a set of coupled Kortewegde
   Vries-type (KdV) equations that support inviscid and smooth travelling
   waves numerically computed using the Petviashvili method. In physical
   space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices concentrated near
   the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or that wrap around the pipe axis
   (centre vortexons), in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions
   derived by Fedele (Fluid Dyn. Res., 44 (2012) 45509). The KdV dynamics
   of a perturbation is also investigated by means of a high accurate
   Fourier-based numerical scheme. We observe that an initial vortical
   patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating patches of vorticity near
   the wall. These can undergo further splitting leading to a proliferation
   of centre vortexons that eventually decay due to viscous effects. The
   splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity
   from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with the inverse cascade of
   cross-stream vorticity identified in channel flows by Eyink (Plysica D,
   237 (2008) 1956). The inviscid vortexon most likely is unstable to
   non-axisymmetric disturbances and may be a precursor to puffs and slug
   flow formation. Copyright (c) EPLA, 2013}},

Abstract = {{Numerous applications in neuroscience research and neural prosthetics,
   such as electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording and retinal prosthesis,
   involve electrical interactions with soft excitable tissues using a
   surface recording and/or stimulation approach. These applications
   require an interface that is capable of setting up high-throughput
   communications between the electrical circuit and the excitable tissue
   and that can dynamically conform to the shape of the soft tissue. Being
   a compliant material with mechanical impedance close to that of soft
   tissues, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) offers excellent potential as a
   substrate material for such neural interfaces. This paper describes an
   integrated technology for fabrication of PDMS-based stretchable
   microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Specifically, as an integral part of the
   fabrication process, a stretchable MEA is directly fabricated with a
   rigid substrate, such as a thin printed circuit board (PCB), through an
   innovative bonding technology-via-bonding-for integrated packaging. This
   integrated strategy overcomes the conventional challenge of high-density
   packaging for this type of stretchable electronics. Combined with a
   high-density interconnect technology developed previously, this
   stretchable MEA technology facilitates a high-resolution, high-density
   integrated system solution for neural and muscular surface interfacing.
   In this paper, this PDMS-based integrated stretchable MEA (isMEA)
   technology is demonstrated by an example design that packages a
   stretchable MEA with a small PCB. The resulting isMEA is assessed for
   its biocompatibility, surface conformability, electrode impedance
   spectrum, and capability to record muscle fiber activity when applied
   epimysially.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate adaptive configuration of spatial and

   relationship between the EE and the spectral efficiency (SE) in downlink
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division
   multiple access (OFDMA) systems. We formulate the problem as minimizing
   the total power consumed at the base station under constraints on the
   ergodic capacities from multiple users, the total number of subcarriers,
   and the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. A three-step searching
   algorithm is developed to solve this problem. We then analyze the impact
   of spatial-frequency resources, overall SE requirement and user fairness
   on the SE-EE relationship. Analytical and simulation results show that
   increasing frequency resource is more efficient than increasing spatial
   resource to improve the SE-EE relationship as a whole. The EE increases
   with the SE when the frequency resource is not constrained to the
   maximum value, otherwise a tradeoff between the SE and the EE exists.
   Sacrificing the fairness among users in terms of ergodic capacities can
   enhance the SE-EE relationship. In general, the adaptive configuration
   of spatial and frequency resources outperforms the adaptive
   configuration of only spatial or frequency resource.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the fundamental limits of secret-key agreement

   low-power regime is shown to be independent of the eavesdropper's

   Gaussian symbols along the direction corresponding to the maximal
   eigenvalue of the legitimate channel matrix. Hence, by beamforming and
   waterfilling over the main channel alone, one obtains a semi-blind
   key-agreement strategy in which the knowledge of the eavesdropper's

Abstract = {{The chemistry of nuclear reactor fuel initially is complex, and
   continuous loss of uranium and plutonium, and formation of a broad range
   of new species due to fission introduce a challenging time-dependence to
   this chemistry; Lanthanides and/or Actinides substitution on the uranium
   sublattice occurs (a) during fission, (b) when mixed oxide fuel is used,
   and (c) when minor Actinides are reprocessed in UO2 matrix fuel as part
   of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. These fission products and minor
   Actinides influence a variety of thermo-physical properties, which
   depend on structure and elastic properties. How these structural and
   elastic properties vary with Lanthanide and Actinide substitution is not
   well studied. In this study we use atomic level simulations to
   investigate the effect of 4+ and 3+ ion substitutions on the structural
   and elastic properties of urania matrix. Our results show that most of
   the 4+ ions reduce the overall lattice parameter, while all the 3+ ions
   considered here increased the lattice parameter of the urania matrix.
   This effect is guided by the interplay between the elastic and
   electrostatic effect of the substituted ions. We calculate the chemical
   expansion and chemical expansion coefficient with the change in
   concentration based on the ionic radii of the substituted 3+ and 4+
   ions. In general, elastic properties are enhanced for 4+ ions
   substitution and reduced for 3+ ion substitution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Context and hand posture modulate the neural dynamics of tool-object
   perception}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{506-519}},

Abstract = {{Prior research has linked visual perception of tools with plausible
   motor strategies. Thus, observing a tool activates the putative
   action-stream, including the left posterior parietal cortex. Observing a
   hand functionally grasping a tool involves the inferior frontal cortex.
   However, tool-use movements are performed in a contextual and grasp
   specific manner, rather than relative isolation. Our prior behavioral
   data has demonstrated that the context of tool-use (by pairing the tool
   with different objects) and varying hand grasp postures of the tool can
   interact to modulate subjects' reaction times while evaluating
   tool-object content. Specifically, perceptual judgment was delayed in
   the evaluation of functional tool-object pairings (Correct context) when
   the tool was non-functionally (Manipulative) grasped. Here, we
   hypothesized that this behavioral interference seen with the
   Manipulative posture would be due to increased and extended left
   parietofrontal activity possibly underlying motor simulations when
   resolving action conflict due to this particular grasp at time scales
   relevant to the behavioral data. Further, we hypothesized that this
   neural effect will be restricted to the Correct tool-object context
   wherein action affordances are at a maximum.
   64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 16
   right-handed subjects while viewing images depicting three classes of
   tool-object contexts: functionally Correct (e.g. coffee pot-coffee mug),
   functionally Incorrect (e.g. coffee pot-marker) and Spatial (coffee
   pot-milk). The Spatial context pairs a tool and object that would not
   functionally match, but may commonly appear in the same scene. These
   three contexts were modified by hand interaction: No Hand, Static Hand
   near the tool, Functional Hand posture and Manipulative Hand posture.
   The Manipulative posture is convenient for relocating a tool but does
   not afford a functional engagement of the tool on the target object.
   Subjects were instructed to visually assess whether the pictures
   displayed correct tool-object associations. EEG data was analyzed in
   time-voltage and time-frequency domains. Overall, Static Hand,
   Functional and Manipulative postures cause early activation (100-400 ms
   post image onset) of parietofrontal areas, to varying intensity in each
   context, when compared to the No Hand control condition. However, when
   context is Correct, only the Manipulative Posture significantly induces
   extended neural responses, predominantly over right parietal and right
   frontal areas {[}400-600 ms post image onset]. Significant power
   increase was observed in the theta band {[}4-8 Hz] over the right
   frontal area, {[}0-500 ms]. In addition, when context is Spatial,
   Manipulative posture alone significantly induces extended neural
   responses, over bilateral parietofrontal and left motor areas {[}400-600
   ms]. Significant power decrease occurred primarily in beta bands
   {[}12-16, 20-25 Hz] over the aforementioned brain areas {[}400-600 ms].
   Here, we demonstrate that the neural processing of tool-object
   perception is sensitive to several factors. While both Functional and
   Manipulative postures in Correct context engage predominantly an early
   left parietofrontal circuit, the Manipulative posture alone extends the
   neural response and transitions to a late right parietofrontal network.
   This suggests engagement of a right neural system to evaluate action
   affordances when hand posture does not support action (Manipulative).
   Additionally, when tool-use context is ambiguous (Spatial context),
   there is increased bilateral parietofrontal activation and, extended
   neural response for the Manipulative posture. These results point to the
   existence of other networks evaluating tool-object associations when
   motoric affordances are not readily apparent and underlie corresponding
   delayed perceptual judgment in our prior behavioral data wherein
   Manipulative postures had exclusively interfered in judging tool-object
   content. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{State-of-the-art hydraulic hose and piping systems employ integral
   sensor nodes for structural health monitoring to avoid catastrophic
   failures. Energy harvesting in hydraulic systems could enable
   self-powered wireless sensor nodes for applications such as
   energy-autonomous structural health monitoring and prognosis. Hydraulic
   systems inherently have a high energy intensity associated with the mean
   pressure and flow. Accompanying the mean pressure is the dynamic
   pressure ripple, which is caused by the action of pumps and actuators.
   Pressure ripple is a deterministic source with a periodic time-domain
   behavior conducive to energy harvesting. An energy harvester prototype
   was designed for generating low-power electricity from pressure ripples.
   The prototype employed an axially-poled off-the-shelf piezoelectric
   stack. A housing isolated the stack from the hydraulic fluid while
   maintaining a mechanical coupling allowing for dynamic-pressure-induced
   deflection of the stack. The prototype exhibited an off-resonance energy
   harvesting problem since the fundamental resonance of the piezoelectric
   stack was much higher than the frequency content of the pressure ripple.
   The prototype was designed to provide a suitable power output for
   powering sensors with a maximum output of 1.2 mW. This work also
   presents electromechanical model simulations and experimental
   characterization of the piezoelectric power output from the pressure
   ripple in terms of the force transmitted into the harvester.}},

Abstract = {{The rates of charging and discharging in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
   are critically controlled by the kinetics of Li Insertion and extraction
   in solid-state electrodes. Silicon is being intensively studied as a
   high-capacity anode material for LIBs. However, the kinetics of Li
   reaction and diffusion in Si remain unclear. Here we report a combined
   experimental and theoretical study of the lithiation kinetics in
   individual Si nanowires. By using in situ transmission electron
   microscopy, we measure the rate of growth of a surface layer of
   amorphous LixSi in crystalline Si nanowires during the first lithiation.
   The results show the self-limiting lithiation, which is attributed to
   the retardation effect of the lithiation-induced stress. Our work
   provides a direct measurement of the nanoscale growth kinetics in
   lithiated Si, and has implications on nanostructures for achieving the
   high capacity and high rate in the development of high performance LIBs.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1628-1637}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs) and chemically reduced graphene
   nanoribbons (crGNRs) were dispersed at high concentrations in
   chlorosulfonic acid to form anisotropic liquid crystal phases. The
   liquid crystal solutions were spun directly into hundreds of meters of
   continuous macroscopic fibers. The relationship of fiber morphology to
   coagulation bath conditions was studied. The effects of colloid
   concentration, annealing temperature, spinning air gap, and pretension
   during annealing on the fibers performance were also investigated. Heat
   treatment of the as-spun GONR fibers at 1500 degrees C produced
   thermally reduced graphene nanoribbon (trGNR) fibers with a tensile
   strength of 378 MPa, Voting's modulus of 36.2 GPa, and electrical
   conductivity of 285 S/cm, which is considerably higher than that in
   other reported graphene-derived fibers. This better trGNR fiber
   performance was due to the air gap spinning and annealing with
   pretension that produced higher molecular alignment within the fibers,
   as determined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The
   specific modulus of trGNR fibers is higher than that of the commercial
   general purpose carbon fibers and commonly used metals such as Al, Cu,
   and steel. The properties of trGNR fibers can be further Improved by
   optimizing the spinning conditions with higher draw ratio, annealing
   conditions with higher pretensions, and using longer flake GONRs. This
   technique is a new high-carbon-yield approach to make the next
   generation carbon fibers based on solution-based liquid crystal phase
   spinning.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1803-1810}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrated the first piezoelectric effect on the performance of a
   pH sensor using an MSM back-to-back Schottky contacted ZnO
   micro/nanowire device. When the device is subjected to an external
   strain, a piezopotential is created in the micro/nanowire, which tunes
   the effective heights of the Schottky barriers at the local contacts,
   consequently increasing the sensitivity and signal level of the sensors.
   Furthermore, the strain-produced piezopotential along the ZnO
   micro/nanowire will lead to a nonuniform distribution of the target
   molecules near the micro/nanowire surface owing to electrostatic
   interaction, which will make the sensor proactive to detect the target
   molecules even at extremely low overall concentration, which naturally
   improves the sensitivity and lowers the detection limit. A theoretical
   model is proposed to explain the observed performance of the sensor
   using the energy band diagram. This prototype device offers a new
   concept for designing supersensitive and fast-response micro/nanowire
   sensors by introducing an external strain and piezotronic effect, which
   may have great applications in building sensors with fast response and
   reset time, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and good signal-to-noise
   ratio for chemical, biochemical, and gas sensing.}},

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We have investigated the effect of alloying metal elements on hydrogen
   solubility and mechanical integrity of Nb-based alloys, Nb15M1 (whereM =
   Ca-Zn, Ge), using first principles-based calculations. In general, the
   chemical interaction between the interstitial H and metal is weakened as
   the alloying element is changed from an early to a late transition
   metal, leading to lower H solubility and higher resistance to H
   embrittlement. This effect becomes more pronounced when a smaller
   alloying element is used due to stronger elastic interaction between
   interstitial H and metal atoms. These finding may provide scientific
   basis for rational design of Nb-based hydrogen separation membranes with
   tailored H solubility to effectively suppress H embrittlement while
   maintaining excellent hydrogen permeation rate. Copyright 2013

Abstract = {{The use of nano-sized particles in cementitious materials introduces a
   myriad of potential innovations from new functionality to enhanced
   mechanical performance, but such materials can be energy-intensive to
   manufacture. With increasing emphasis on sustainable development, it is
   important to investigate and understand benefits and costs of using
   nanomaterials compared to relatively less energy-intensive
   microparticles. The current research investigates the effect of
   chemically inert nano and microparticles (i.e., titanium dioxide (TiO2)
   and calcium carbonate (limestone)) on early age properties and behavior
   of cement-based materials. Results indicate that the early age hydration
   rates, shrinkage, and pore structure of cement-based materials can be
   modified and optimized by tailoring the size of fillers. Life cycle
   analysis indicates that photocatalytic reactivity of TiO2 could offset
   initial higher environmental impacts. Thus, optimally sized
   nanoparticles could revolutionize the construction industry by allowing
   tailoring of structure and properties of cement-based composites, with
   environmental sustainability preserved through the selection of lower
   embodied-energy particles. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An asphalt cap system physically isolates contaminated soil from surface
   runoff to reduce contaminant migration from soil to groundwater. It is
   one of the most frequently selected remedies for managing sites
   contaminated by hazardous materials. However, despite its wide usage,
   the apparent permeability of aging caps has rarely been studied. Based
   on hydraulic calculations for simplified crack models, this study found
   that the apparent permeability of an aging cap is primarily influenced
   by the intrinsic permeability of cap materials and the geometry of
   cracks. The distribution of crack width, a key indicator of cap
   integrity, was examined for the first time with four asphaltic caps,
   aged 3, 4, 12, and 15 years, respectively. The apparent permeability of
   a 15-year-old cap was estimated to range from 0.87 x 10(-5) to 1 x
   10(-7) cm/s in various areas. The overall average permeability was
   calculated to be 1.3 x 10(-6) +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) cm/s, representing an
   increase of nearly one order of magnitude from the permeability of a
   newly constructed asphalt cap. A spatial analysis indicated that the
   aged asphalt cap was the most permeable in staging areas or areas with
   increased traffic load. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000621. (C)

Title = {{Misleading Health-Related Information Promoted Through Video-Based
   Social Media: Anorexia on YouTube}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The amount of information being uploaded onto social video
   platforms, such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Veoh, continues to spiral, making
   it increasingly difficult to discern reliable health information from
   misleading content. There are thousands of YouTube videos promoting
   misleading information about anorexia (eg, anorexia as a healthy
   lifestyle).
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate anorexia-related
   misinformation disseminated through YouTube videos.
   Methods: We retrieved YouTube videos related to anorexia using the
   keywords anorexia, anorexia nervosa, proana, and thinspo on October 10,
   2011. Three doctors reviewed 140 videos with approximately 11 hours of
   video content, classifying them as informative, pro-anorexia, or others.
   By informative we mean content describing the health consequences of
   anorexia and advice on how to recover from it; by pro-anorexia we mean
   videos promoting anorexia as a fashion, a source of beauty, and that
   share tips and methods for becoming and remaining anorexic. The 40
   most-viewed videos (20 informative and 20 pro-anorexia videos) were
   assessed to gauge viewer behavior.
   Results: The interrater agreement of classification was moderate
   (Fleiss' kappa=0.5), with 29.3\% (n=41) being rated as pro-anorexia,
   55.7\% (n=78) as informative, and 15.0\% (n=21) as others. Pro-anorexia
   videos were favored 3 times more than informative videos (odds ratio
   {[}OR] 3.3, 95\% CI 3.3-3.4, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Pro-anorexia information was identified in 29.3\% of
   anorexia-related videos. Pro-anorexia videos are less common than
   informative videos; however, in proportional terms, pro-anorexia content
   is more highly favored and rated by its viewers. Efforts should focus on
   raising awareness, particularly among teenagers, about the
   trustworthiness of online information about beauty and healthy
   lifestyles. Health authorities producing videos to combat anorexia
   should consider involving celebrities and models to reach a wider
   audience. More research is needed to study the characteristics of
   pro-anorexia videos in order to develop algorithms that will
   automatically detect and filter those videos before they become popular.

Abstract = {{Two most commonly used dithiocarbamate (DTC) pesticides,
   dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDTC) and diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), were
   examined in this study to evaluate their potential to form nitrosamines
   when in contact with various water disinfection oxidants. Results show
   that DTCs can serve as nitrosamine precursors, by release of secondary
   amines through hydrolysis or through reactions with oxidants. The
   reactions of DTCs with monochloramine and ozone were found to be
   particularly problematic in the risk of generating nitrosamines, though
   all four tested oxidants, including free chlorine and chlorine dioxide,
   formed nitrosamines. NDEA yield from DEDTC was lower, by different
   degrees, than NDMA yield from DMDTC for all four oxidants, which was
   attributed to the steric hindrance associated with bulkier reaction
   intermediate that are more difficult to be further oxidized to form
   nitrosamine. The yield of nitrosamines increased with the oxidant dosage
   for both monochloramination and zonation of DTCs. Results for
   nitrosamine formation from DTCs at varying pH were found to be
   consistent with the pH trend of nitrosamine formation from ozonation and
   monochloramination of secondary amines. Kinetic study results and
   identification and quantification of reaction products suggest that the
   DTCs were not significant direct precursors of nitrosamines during
   monochloramination or ozonation, but rather nitrosamines formed were
   primarily from reaction of oxidants with the amine which may be
   generated either through hydrolysis or through oxidation of DTCs. (C)

Abstract = {{Proteoglycans (PGs) are crucial extracellular matrix (ECM) components
   that are present in all tissues and organs. Pathological remodeling of
   these macromolecules can lead to severe diseases such as osteoarthritis

   routinely diagnosed by invasive analytical methods. Here, we employed
   Raman microspectroscopy, a laser-based, marker-free and non-destructive
   technique that allows the generation of spectra with peaks originating
   from molecular vibrations within a sample, to identify specific Raman
   bands that can be assigned to PGs within human and porcine cartilage
   samples and chondrocytes. Based on the non-invasively acquired Raman
   spectra, we further revealed that a prolonged in vitro culture leads to
   phenotypic alterations of chondrocytes, resulting in a decreased PG
   synthesis rate and loss of lipid contents. Our results are the first to
   demonstrate the applicability of Raman microspectroscopy as an
   analytical and potential diagnostic tool for non-invasive cell and

Abstract = {{Green modular design can facilitate life-cycle material efficiency
   through component material reuse and minimizing resource commitment
   throughout the product realization process. Traditional modular design
   has been motivated toward delivering variety at low cost, but with
   little incentive for material efficiency per se. The key technical
   challenge for incorporating material efficiency considerations into the
   prevailing modularization theories and methods lies in that such
   material reuse modularity must be consistent with and conform to the
   legacy structure of a technical system. This paper is geared toward a
   total system approach and emphasizes leader follower joint optimization
   in order to leverage technical system modularity (TSM) and material
   reuse modularity (MRM) within a coherent framework. To measure component
   interactions and cluster components into modules, taxonomy of modularity
   metrics is developed encompassing the entire life cycle of material
   fulfillment. The quantification and aggregation of modularity measures
   are formulated by multi-attribute utilities of different dimensions of
   component similarity. Furthermore, a bilevel optimization model based on
   a constrained genetic algorithm is put forward for joint decisions of
   TSM and MRM. A case study of refrigerator green modular design is
   reported. Results and analyses reveal that the leader-follower bilevel
   optimization model is robust and excels in supporting green modular
   design with material reuse. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cerenkov luminescence imaging based on light emission from the decay of
   radionuclides has recently drawn great interest in molecular imaging. In
   this paper, we report for the first time the Cerenkov luminescence
   phenomenon of Au-198 isotope, as well as a facile route to the
   preparation of radioluminescent Au nanocages without additional
   radiolabeling or dye conjugation. The specific radioactivity of the Au
   nanocages could be easily and precisely controlled by varying the
   concentration of (HAuCl4)-Au-198 precursor used for the galvanic
   replacement reaction. The direct incorporation of Au-198 atoms into the
   structure of Au nanocages enabled the ability of accurate analysis and
   real-time imaging in vivo. Furthermore, under biological conditions the
   radioactive Au nanocages were shown to emit light with wavelengths in
   the visible and near-infrared regions, enabling luminescence imaging of
   the whole mice in vivo, as well as the organs ex vivo. When combined
   with their favorable scattering and absorption properties in the
   near-infrared region, the radioactive Au nanocages can serve as a new
   platform for multimodality imaging and will have a significant impact on
   both small animal and clinical imaging.}},

Abstract = {{ZnO nanowire inorganic/organic hybrid ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting
   diodes (LEDs) have attracted considerable attention as they not only
   combine the high flexibility of polymers with the structural and
   chemical stability of inorganic nanostructures but also have a higher
   light extraction efficiency than thin film structures. However, up to
   date, the external quantum efficiency of UV LED based on ZnO
   nanostructures has been limited by a lack of efficient methods to
   achieve a balance between electron contributed current and hole
   contributed current that reduces the nonradiative recombination at
   interface. Here we demonstrate that the piezo-phototronic effect can
   largely enhance the efficiency of a hybridized inorganic/organic LED
   made of a ZnO nanowire/p-polymer structure, by trimming the electron
   current to match the hole current and increasing the localized hole
   density near the interface through a carrier channel created by
   piezoelectric polarization charges on the ZnO side. The external
   efficiency of the hybrid LED was enhanced by at least a factor of 2
   after applying a proper strain, reaching 5.92\%. This study offers a new
   concept for increasing organic LED efficiency and has a great potential
   for a wide variety of high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized portable electronics and will
   be a key to electrifying transport vehicles and delivering renewable
   electricity. Amorphous silicon (a-Si) is being intensively studied as a
   high-capacity anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.
   Its lithiation has been widely thought to occur through a single-phase
   mechanism with gentle Li profiles, thus offering a significant potential
   for mitigating pulverization and capacity fade. Here, we discover a
   surprising two-phase process of electrochemical lithiation in a-Si by
   using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The lithiation occurs by
   the movement of a sharp phase boundary between the a-Si reactant and an
   amorphous LixSi (a-LixSi, x similar to 2.5) product. Such a striking
   amorphous-amorphous interface exists until the remaining a-Si is
   consumed. Then a second step of lithiation sets in without a visible
   interface, resulting in the final product of a-LixSi (x similar to
   3.75). We show that the two-phase lithiation can be the fundamental
   mechanism underpinning the anomalous morphological change of
   microfabricated a-Si electrodes, i.e., from a disk shape to a dome
   shape. Our results represent a significant step toward the understanding
   of the electrochemically driven reaction and degradation in amorphous
   materials, which is critical to the development of microstructurally
   stable electrodes for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{In general, methyl orange (MO) can be degraded by an electrocatalytic
   oxidation process driven by a power source due to the generation of
   superoxidative hydroxyl radical on the anode. Here, we report a hybrid
   energy cell that is used for a self-powered electrocatalytic process for
   the degradation of MO without using an external power source. The hybrid
   energy cell can simultaneously or individually harvest mechanical and
   thermal energies. The mechanical energy was harvested by the
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) fabricated at the top by using a
   flexible polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) nanowire array with diameters of
   about 200 nm. A pyroelectric nanogenerator (PENG) was fabricated below
   the TENG to harvest thermal energy. The power output of the device can
   be directly used for electrodegradation of MO, demonstrating a
   self-powered electrocatalytic oxidation process.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a simple, cost-effective, and scalable approach
   to fabricate a triboelectric nanogenerator (NG) with ultrahigh electric
   output. Triggered by commonly available ambient mechanical energy such
   as human footfalls, a NG with size smaller than a human palm can
   generate maximum short-circuit current of 2 mA, delivering instantaneous
   power output of 1.2 W to external load. The power output corresponds to
   an area power density of 313 W/m(2) and a volume power density of 54 268
   W/m(3) at an open-circuit voltage of similar to 1200 V. An energy
   conversion efficiency of 14.9\% has been achieved. The power was capable
   of instantaneously lighting up as many as 600 multicolor commercial LED
   bulbs. The record high power output for the NG is attributed to
   optimized structure, proper materials selection and nanoscale surface
   modification. This work demonstrated the practicability of using NG to
   harvest large-scale mechanical energy, such as footsteps, rolling
   wheels, wind power, and ocean waves.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromodulators, such as amines and neuropeptides, alter the activity of
   neurons and neuronal networks. In this work, we investigate how
   neuromodulators, which activate G(q)-protein second messenger systems,
   can modulate the bursting frequency of neurons in a critical portion of
   the respiratory neural network, the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC).
   These neurons are a vital part of the ponto-medullary neuronal network,
   which generates a stable respiratory rhythm whose frequency is regulated
   by neuromodulator release from the nearby Raphe nucleus. Using a
   simulated 50-cell network of excitatory preBotC neurons with a
   heterogeneous distribution of persistent sodium conductance and Ca2+, we
   determined conditions for frequency modulation in such a network by
   simulating interaction between Raphe and preBotC nuclei. We found that
   the positive feedback between the Raphe excitability and preBotC
   activity induces frequency modulation in the preBotC neurons. In
   addition, the frequency of the respiratory rhythm can be regulated via
   phasic release of excitatory neuromodulators from the Raphe nucleus. We
   predict that the application of a G(q) antagonist will eliminate this
   frequency modulation by the Raphe and keep the network frequency
   constant and low. In contrast, application of a G(q) agonist will result
   in a high frequency for all levels of Raphe stimulation. Our modeling
   results also suggest that high {[}K+] requirement in respiratory brain
   slice experiments may serve as a compensatory mechanism for low
   neuromodulatory tone. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a one-port test approach is proposed for testing radio
   frequency (RF) interconnects as well as RF passive filters embedded in
   RF substrates. The proposed technique relies on the use of an RF
   oscillator that is coupled to the embedded interconnect/filter via a
   probe card. Shifts in the RF oscillation frequency (referred to as
   resonance-based test) are used for defect detection, and are different
   from prior oscillation-based test techniques that configure the device
   under test itself into an oscillator. A core innovation is that the
   technique can detect defects in embedded passives/filters using only
   one-port probe access and eliminates the need of an external RF input
   test stimulus. Such one-port probing causes a shift in the oscillation
   frequency of the external oscillator because of the loading from the
   embedded RF passive circuit. To facilitate test response measurement,
   the output of the external RF oscillator (GHz signal) is down-converted
   to lower frequencies (MHz). The proposed test method is demonstrated
   through both simulations and measurements. Additionally, panel-level
   testing of RF substrates is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{A novel feedback bias technique for a multistage cascode topology is
   developed to improve the linearity and reliability of power amplifiers
   (PAs). Due to the large parasitic capacitance and low substrate
   resistivity of CMOS technology, signal swings are coupled between the
   ports of transistors. The proposed method utilized the RF leakage
   signals at the gate of common-gate (CG) transistor in a cascode topology
   for employing negative feedback, which not only enhances the linearity
   of the PA, but also alleviates the voltage stress between the gate and
   the drain of the CG device in a cascode topology from 4.5 to 1.9 V. This
   technique requires no additional components or space and is easily
   applicable to the multistage cascode topology, which is one of the most
   popular structures of CMOS PA designs. In order to prove the concept, a
   1.95-GHz fully integrated linear PA was implemented in a 0.18-mu m CMOS
   technology. With a 3.4-V power supply, the PA transmits a saturated
   output power of 26 dBm with a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 46.4\%,
   and a linear output power of 23.5 dBm with a PAE of 40\% using a 3 GPP
   WCDMA modulated signal. The PA occupies 1.60 x 0.52 mm(2). This PA
   demonstrates the potential of the highly efficient CMOS PA design
   approach for wireless communication standards.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has achieved submicron lateral resolution
   in showing subcellular structures; however, relatively few endogenous
   subcellular contrasts have so far been imaged. Given that the
   hemeprotein, mostly cytochromes in general cells, is optically absorbing
   around the Soret peak (similar to 420 nm), we implemented label-free PAM
   of cytochromes in cytoplasm for the first time. By measuring the
   photoacoustic spectra of the oxidized and reduced states of fibroblast
   lysate and fitting the difference spectrum with three types of
   cytochromes, we found that the three cytochromes account for more than
   half the optical absorption in the cell lysate at 420 nm wavelength.
   Fixed fibroblasts on slides were imaged by PAM at 422 and 250 nm
   wavelengths to reveal cytoplasms and nuclei, respectively, as confirmed
   by standard staining histology. PAM was also applied to label-free
   histology of mouse ear sections by showing cytoplasms and nuclei of
   various cells. PAM of cytochromes in cytoplasm is expected to be a
   high-throughput, label-free technique for studying live cell functions,
   which cannot be accomplished by conventional histology. (C) 2013 Society

   communication will show that current mechanism of stalling, which is
   used to account for the fact that the rate of insertion errors in
   nonenzymatic RNA replication are much lower than would be expected, can
   be modeled by using the MayoLewis equation for calculating copolymer
   composition in copolymerizations of synthetic polymers. Using kinetic

   the error threshold for RNA replication. Agreement with the accepted

   10.1152/ajpheart.00620.2012.-Spontaneous plaque rupture in mouse models
   of atherosclerosis is controversial, although numerous studies have
   discussed so-called ``vulnerable plaque{''} phenotypes in mice. We
   compared the morphology and biomechanics of two acute and one chronic
   murine model of atherosclerosis to human coronaries of the thin-cap
   fibroatheroma (TCFA) phenotype. Our acute models were apolipoprotein
   E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) and LDL receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) mice, both
   fed a high-fat diet for 8 wk with simultaneous infusion of angiotensin
   II (ANG II), and our chronic mouse model was the apolipoprotein
   E-deficient strain fed a regular chow diet for 1 yr. We found that the
   mouse plaques from all three models exhibited significant morphological
   differences from human TCFA plaques, including the plaque burden, plaque
   thickness, eccentricity, and amount of the vessel wall covered by lesion
   as well as significant differences in the relative composition of
   plaques. These morphological differences suggested that the distribution
   of solid mechanical stresses in the walls may differ as well. Using a
   finite-element analysis computational solid mechanics model, we computed
   the relative distribution of stresses in the walls of murine and human
   plaques and found that although human TCFA plaques have the highest
   stresses in the thin fibrous cap, murine lesions do not have such stress
   distributions. Instead, local maxima of stresses were on the media and
   adventitia, away from the plaque. Our results suggest that if plaque
   rupture is possible in mice, it may be driven by a different mechanism
   than mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for assessment of the potential impacts of extraction of
   energy associated with astronomical tides is described and applied to a
   site on the Beaufort River in coastal South Carolina, USA. Despite its
   name, the site features negligible freshwater inputs; like many in the
   region, it is a tidal estuary that resembles a river. A
   three-dimensional, numerical, hydrodynamic model was applied for a
   period exceeding a lunar month, allowing quantification of harmonic
   constituents of water level and velocity, and comparison to values
   derived from measurements, recorded at a location within the model
   domain. The measurement campaign included surveys of bathymetry and
   velocity fields during ebb and flood portions of a tidal cycle for model
   validation. Potential far-field impacts of a generic tidal energy
   conversion device were simulated by introducing an additional drag force
   in the model to enhance dissipation, resulting in 10-60\% dissipation of
   the pre-existing kinetic power within a flow cross-section. The model
   reveals effects of the dissipation on water levels and velocities in
   adjacent areas, which are relatively small even at the 60\% dissipation
   level. A method is presented to estimate the optimal vertical location
   for the energy conversion device and the potential power sacrificed by
   moving to a different altitude. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, finite element, Mori-Tanaka and strong contrast modeling
   are carried out for the prediction of the effective thermal conductivity
   and elastic modulus of isotropic random two-phase composite materials

   conductivity and elastic modulus are analyzed. Our results show that
   finite element method could capture more details in the prediction of
   effective properties of the composite materials. On the other hand,
   Mori-Tanaka method is shown to be a fast as well as a valid alternative
   for the finite element modeling within a limited range of fillers
   geometries. Our results reveal that the strong contrast method based on
   statistical two-point correlation functions could not accurately

Abstract = {{Light-weight antenna arrays require utilizing the same antenna aperture
   to provide multiple functions (e. g., communications and radar) in
   separate frequency bands. In this paper, we present a novel antenna
   element design for a dual-band array, comprising interleaved printed
   dipoles spaced to avoid grating lobes in each band. The folded dipoles
   are designed to be resonant at octave-separated frequency bands (1 and 2
   GHz), and inkjet-printed on photographic paper. Each dipole is gap-fed
   by voltage induced electromagnetically from a microstrip line on the
   other side of the substrate. This nested element configuration shows
   excellent corroboration between simulated and measured data, with 10-dB
   return loss bandwidth of at least 5\% for each band and interchannel
   isolation better than 15 dB. The measured element gain is 5.3 to 7 dBi
   in the two bands, with cross-polarization less than -25 dBi. A large
   array containing 39 printed dipoles has been fabricated on paper, with
   each dipole individually fed to facilitate independent beam control.
   Measurements on the array reveal broadside gain of 12 to 17 dBi in each
   band with low cross-polarization.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike hard disks, flash devices use out-of-place updates operations and
   require a garbage collection (GC) process to reclaim invalid pages to
   create free blocks. This GC process is a major cause of performance
   degradation when running concurrently with other I/O operations as
   internal bandwidth is consumed to reclaim these invalid pages. The
   invocation of the GC process is generally governed by a low watermark on
   free blocks and other internal device metrics that different workloads
   meet at different intervals. This results in an I/O performance that is
   highly dependent on workload characteristics. In this paper, we examine
   the GC process and propose a semipreemptible GC (PGC) scheme that allows
   GC processing to be preempted while pending I/O requests in the queue
   are serviced. Moreover, we further enhance flash performance by
   pipelining internal GC operations and merge them with pending I/O
   requests whenever possible. Our experimental evaluation of this semi-PGC
   scheme with realistic workloads demonstrates both improved performance
   and reduced performance variability. Write-dominant workloads show up to
   a 66.56\% improvement in average response time with a 83.30\% reduced
   variance in response time compared to the non-PGC scheme. In addition,
   we explore opportunities of a new NAND flash device that supports
   suspend/resume commands for read, write, and erase operations for fully
   PGC (F-PGC). Our experiments with an F-PGC enabled flash device show
   that request response time can be improved by up to 14.57\% compared to
   semi-PGC.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric stack actuators have the advantages of zero backlash and
   no acoustic noise, but their stroke is too small to actuate robotic
   links directly. Because the force available is often more than the
   required, the stroke of the piezoelectric stack can be amplified by a
   compliant mechanism at the expense of force. It is not always clear what
   the geometry of this compliant mechanism should be. Compliant mechanisms
   have parallels in biology in that they describe two-way interactions
   between the actuator and the environment. In this paper, we employ the
   concept of a two-port network model from circuit theory to describe this
   two-way interaction and present a method to obtain each element of the
   two-port model as an analytical function of physical geometric
   parameters for a wide class of geometries. This method makes use of
   Castigliano's theorem and Euler-Bernoulli linearly elastic beam theory.
   To our knowledge, this is the first two-port representation of a
   compliant mechanism that is based on analytical expressions of geometric
   parameters. This analytical model agrees well with finite-element method
   calculations. We also examine a representative case experimentally and
   achieve accuracies better than 18\%.}},

Abstract = {{The hemodynamics in patients with total cavopulmonary connections (TCPC)
   is generally very complex and characterized by patient-to-patient
   variability. To better understand its effect on patients' outcome, CFD
   models are widely used, also to test and optimize surgical options
   before their implementation. These models often assume rigid geometries,
   despite the motion experienced by thoracic vessels that could influence
   the hemodynamics predictions. By improving their accuracy and expanding
   the range of simulated interventions, the benefit of treatment planning
   for patients is expected to increase. We simulate three types of
   intervention on a patient-specific 3D model, and compare their predicted
   outcome with baseline condition: a decrease in pulmonary vascular
   resistance obtainable with medications; a surgical revision of the
   connection design; the introduction of a fenestration in the TCPC wall.
   The simulations are performed both with rigid wall assumption and
   including patient-specific TCPC wall motion, reconstructed from a 4DMRI
   dataset. The results show the effect of each option on clinically
   important metrics and highlight the impact of patient-specific wall
   motion. The largest differences between rigid and moving wall models are
   observed in measures of energetic efficiency of TCPC as well as in
   hepatic flow distribution and transit time of seeded particles through
   the connection.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the characteristics, sources and water-solubility of
   submicron organic aerosol (OA) were investigated in Helsinki, Finland.
   An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer
   (HR-ToF-AMS) was used to determine the submicron non-refractory aerosol
   components nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride and organics between
   April 9 and May 8, 2009. The concentrations of the major water-soluble
   ions and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were measured by a
   particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS) combined with a total organic carbon
   (TOC) analyzer and two ion chromatographs (IC) between April 25 and May
   28, 2009. Parallel measurements of the submicron particulate matter
   (PM1), organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), meteorological quantities
   and trace gases were used to complement and validate the AMS and
   PILS-TOC-IC data.
   Sources or atmospheric processes affecting the organic aerosol were
   investigated by applying the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF)
   analysis to the high-resolution mass spectra of the HR-ToF-AMS organics.
   All together seven factors were needed to describe the variation in the
   obtained dataset. The factors consisted of two different types of
   low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), local and long-range-transported
   (LRT) biomass burning OA (BBOA), semi-volatile OA (SV-OOA),
   hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), and one local source (coffee roastery). These
   factors were interpretable and could be connected to specific sources or
   chemical characteristics (biomass burning, traffic, biogenic emissions,
   oxidized long-range-transported aerosols, marine-processed aerosols and
   nearby industrial activity) of ambient aerosols. In order to study the
   organic fraction and PMF factors further, the elemental ratios OM:OC,
   0:C, H:C and N:C were calculated. The value of the OM:OC ratio varied
   between 1.4 and 2.1. A high OM:OC ratio (1.5-2.1) was observed for the
   highly-oxidized and water-soluble fraction, whereas this ratio was
   clearly lower (1.2-1.4) for local and fresh sources such as traffic. Two
   different factors representing local and long-range-transported biomass
   burning were observed. Local biomass burning emissions had a lower OM:OC
   ratio, indicating that this factor was less aged and had a different
   source area compared with the LRT BBOA. The water-solubilities of the OA
   factors were studied by investigating the correlation between these
   factors and WSOC and by reconstructing the concentration of
   water-soluble particulate organic matter (WSPOM) from the OA factors.
   The reconstructed WSPOM had a good correlation with the measured
   concentration of WSPOM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A micrometer-scale ultrasonic fatigue characterization technique is
   introduced to investigate the fatigue degradation properties of LIGA Ni
   structural films in the very high cycle fatigue regime. Kilohertz
   microresonators fabricated with the MetalMUMPs process were driven at
   resonance (similar to 8 kHz) in controlled environments (30 degrees C,
   50\% relative humidity (RH); 80 degrees C, 5\% RH; and 80 degrees C,
   90\% RH) to perform fatigue tests on 20-mu m-thick Ni notched beams
   subjected to fully reversed bending over a wide range of stress
   amplitudes. It is shown that the fatigue degradation occurring at the
   notch, observed with scanning electron microscopy, can be quantified
   with the measured evolution of the microresonators' resonant frequency.
   The fatigue damage consists of extrusion formation and microcrack
   nucleation and does not propagate to form fatal cracks due to the
   extreme stress gradients at the notch. The resonant frequency evolution
   for fatigue tests performed at 80 degrees C, 90\% RH suggests that
   stress-assisted oxidation in the presence of humid environments may
   accentuate fatigue damage formation. This experimental technique brings
   critical information regarding the long-term fatigue degradation
   properties of metallic microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. In
   particular, this technique can allow controlled studies of the effects
   of fatigue localization and large stress gradients typically encountered
   in MEMS components.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially distributed arrays of piezoelectric disks are being applied to
   monitor structural integrity using Lamb waves. Applied loads directly
   affect waves propagating between array elements because of dimensional
   changes and the acoustoelastic effect. Resulting changes in phase
   velocity depend upon the propagation direction as well as the Lamb wave
   mode and frequency. This paper shows from numerical solutions of the
   acoustoelastic wave equation for an isotropic plate that it is possible
   to decouple the effects of a homogeneous biaxial stress into its two
   principal components. As a consequence of both this decoupling and
   material isotropy, the acoustoelastic response of a specific mode and
   frequency is described by only two constants, which can be determined
   from a uniaxial loading experiment. Using this formulation, a method is
   developed and verified via simulations to estimate an arbitrary biaxial
   load from phase velocity changes measured along multiple directions of
   propagation. Results from uniaxial loading experiments on two different
   plates further demonstrate the efficacy of the method. It is also shown
   that opening fatigue cracks may significantly degrade results by
   interfering with Lamb wave direct arrivals, but that this degradation
   can be mitigated by using a reduced set of data from unaffected paths of
   propagation. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{The evaluation of macroscopic material parameters such as fracture
   toughness as functions of microstructural attributes is a fundamental
   issue in material science. The task requires the quantification of both
   microstructure and material response. Currently, no systematic approach
   other than experiments exists for establishing microstructure-fracture
   toughness relations for materials. In this paper, we present a
   multi-scale computational framework based on the cohesive finite element
   method (CFEM) for predicting fracture toughness of materials as a
   function of microstructure. This framework provides a means for
   evaluating fracture toughness through explicit simulation of fracture
   processes in microstructures. The approach uses the J-integral, allowing
   fracture toughness to be calculated for microstructures with random
   heterogeneous phase distributions and fracture processes with arbitrary
   crack paths or microcrack patterns. Calculations carried out concern
   two-phase Al2O3/TiB2 ceramic composites and focus on the effects of
   constitute behavior, phase morphology, phase distribution, phase size
   scale, and interphase bonding on fracture toughness. Results show that
   microstructure and constituent properties can significantly influence
   fracture behavior and combine to determine the overall fracture
   toughness through the activation of different fracture mechanisms. In
   particular, a combination of fine microstructure size scale, rounded
   reinforcement morphology, appropriately balanced interphase bonding
   strength and compliance can best promote desirable crack-reinforcement
   interactions and lead to enhanced fracture toughness. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microstructure and constituent properties combine to determine the
   overall fracture toughness of particle-reinforced brittle composites
   through the activation of different fracture mechanisms. The toughening
   is through increases in energy dissipation when cracks are forced to
   follow tortuous paths. Based on the results of numerical simulations, a
   semi-empirical model is developed to predict the fracture toughness of
   brittle two-phase ceramic composites as a function of statistically
   defined morphological attributes of microstructure, constituent
   properties and interfacial bonding characteristics. The quantification
   of the fracture toughness is achieved by an assessment of the
   contributions of different fracture mechanisms including matrix
   fracture, interfacial debonding and particle cracking to the overall
   energy release rate. In particular, this assessment involves a
   statistical characterization of the competition between crack deflection
   and crack penetration at matrix/reinforcement interfaces using a
   modified version of the energy criterion of He and Hutchinson which
   accounts for the effects of finite reinforcement size, phase volume
   fractions, phase shape and phase distribution. The fracture
   toughness-microstructure relation obtained can be used to identify
   trends for materials design. Although the numerical quantification is
   specific to Al2O3/TiB2 ceramic composites, the approach and the model
   developed apply to brittle particle-reinforced composites in general.

Abstract = {{At high guest (lithium) atom concentrations, the diffusion of host
   (e.g., silicon) atoms may become significant in amorphous Li-alloy-based
   solid electrodes. The effect of this diffusion mechanism on stress
   development is in addition to guest atom diffusion, stress-induced
   enhancement of guest atom diffusion and plasticity. The effect of the
   diffusive migration of host atoms in amorphous Li-alloy-based electrodes
   is investigated using a continuum model. A mixed-form finite element
   framework is developed to simulate the full coupling between stress
   development and interdiffusion. This framework overcomes the challenges
   associated with the numerical evaluation of the hydrostatic stress
   gradient. The analysis focuses on the relative importance of the
   mechanical driving force and chemical driving force for host migration.
   Calculations show that host migration can cause stress reductions of up
   to similar to 20\% in Li-Si electrodes at stress levels below the yield
   threshold of the material. Analyses also show that the long-term steady
   state of stress distribution is independent of the host diffusivity and
   the thermodynamic factor of diffusion which quantifies the tendency of
   the two species of atoms to chemically mix, even though the transient
   behavior (in particular, the peak stresses during charging being
   important quantities) does depend on the thermodynamic factor and the
   host diffusivity. The diffusion of Si (host) introduces a time scale
   which, along with the time scale for Li (guest) diffusion, controls the
   diffusional response of electrodes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   behavior, crossing when a gap is available, regardless of the signal

Abstract = {{Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains are obligate organohalide-respiring
   bacteria harboring multiple distinct reductive dehalogenase (RDase)
   genes within their genomes. A major challenge is to identify substrates
   for the enzymes encoded by these RDase genes. We demonstrate an approach
   that involves blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)
   followed by enzyme activity assays with gel slices and subsequent
   identification of proteins in gel slices using liquid chromatography
   coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RDase expression was
   investigated in cultures of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain BAV1 and in
   the KB-1 consortium growing on chlorinated ethenes and
   1,2-dichloroethane. In cultures of strain BAV1, BvcA was the only RDase
   detected, revealing that this enzyme catalyzes the dechlorination not
   only of vinyl chloride, but also of all dichloroethene isomers and
   1,2-dichloroethane. In cultures of consortium KB-1, five distinct
   Dehalococcoides RDases and one Geobacter RDase were expressed under the
   conditions tested. Three of the five RDases included orthologs to the
   previously identified chlorinated ethene-dechlorinating enzymes VcrA,
   BvcA, and TceA. This study revealed substrate promiscuity for these
   three enzymes and provides a path forward to further explore the largely
   unknown RDase protein family.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) tethered with maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) was
   synthesized using a novel modified sol-gel process, where sodium
   dodecylbenzenesulfonate was introduced into the suspension to prevent
   the undesirable formation of an iron oxide 3D network. Thus, nearly
   monodispersed and homogeneously distributed gamma-Fe2O3 magnetic
   nanoparticles could be obtained on surface of graphene sheets. The
   utilized thermal treatment process did not require a reducing agent for
   reduction of graphene oxide. The morphology and structure of the
   composites were investigated using various characterization techniques.
   As-prepared rGO/Fe2O3 composites were utilized as anodes for half
   lithium ion cells. The 40 wt.\%-rGO/Fe2O3 composite exhibited high
   reversible capacity of 690 mA h g(-1) at current density of 500 mA g(-1)
   and good stability for over 100 cycles, in contrast with that of the
   pure-Fe2O3 nanoparticles which demonstrated rapid degradation to 224 mA
   h g(-1) after 50 cycles. Furthermore, the composite showed good rate
   capability of 280 mA h g(-1) at 10C (similar to 10,000 mA g(-1)). These
   characteristics could be mainly attributed to both the use of an
   effective binder, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and the specific hybrid
   structures that prevent agglomeration of nanoparticles and provide
   buffering spaces needed for volume changes of nanoparticles during
   insertion/extraction of Li ions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The most prevalent nucleic acid detection schemes employ single-stranded
   sequences as probes for capture and detection of oligonucleotide targets
   in solution. In these systems elevated temperature conditions are
   generally used to enhance specificity and limit false positives from
   occurring with mismatched targets. In contrast, the current study uses a
   strand displacement approach between soluble targets and double-stranded
   DNA probes (dsProbes) immobilized on microspheres. In our approach the
   displacement of reporter strands from the dsProbes by the target of
   interest is promoted by the affinity differences between the reporter
   strand and the soluble DNA or RNA targets for the immobilized sequences.
   While displacement activity occurred readily in center mismatched
   dsProbes with a weaker intrinsic affinity, incorporating a two base-long
   single-stranded segment at the free end of the immobilized dsProbes
   resulted in target discrimination not observed for dsProbes possessing
   only a center mismatch. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular Communication (MC) is a communication paradigm based on the
   exchange of molecules. The implicit bio-compatibility and nanoscale
   feasibility of MC make it a promising communication technology for
   nanonetworks. This paper provides a closed-form expression for the
   information capacity of an MC system based on the free diffusion of
   molecules, which is of primary importance to understand the performance
   of the MC paradigm. Unlike previous contributions, the provided capacity
   expression is independent from any coding scheme and takes into account
   the two main effects of the diffusion channel: the memory and the
   molecular noise. For this, the diffusion is decomposed into two
   processes, namely, the Fick's diffusion and the particle location
   displacement, which are analyzed as a cascade of two separate systems.
   The Fick's diffusion captures solely the channel memory, while the
   particle location displacement isolates the molecular noise. The MC
   capacity expression is obtained by combining the two systems as function
   of the diffusion coefficient, the temperature, the transmitter-receiver
   distance, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, and the average
   transmitted power. Numerical results show that a few kilobits per second
   can be reached within a distance range of tenth of micrometer and for an
   average transmitted power around 1 pW.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a tubular structure segmentation method that
   utilizes a second order tensor constructed from directional intensity
   measurements, which is inspired from diffusion tensor image (DTI)
   modeling. The constructed anisotropic tensor which is fit inside a
   vessel drives the segmentation analogously to a tractography approach in
   DTI. Our model is initialized at a single seed point and is capable of
   capturing whole vessel trees by an automatic branch detection algorithm
   developed in the same framework. The centerline of the vessel as well as
   its thickness is extracted. Performance results within the Rotterdam
   Coronary Artery Algorithm Evaluation framework are provided for
   comparison with existing techniques. 96.4\% average overlap with ground
   truth delineated by experts is obtained in addition to other measures
   reported in the paper. Moreover, we demonstrate further quantitative
   results over synthetic vascular datasets, and we provide quantitative
   experiments for branch detection on patient computed tomography
   angiography (CTA) volumes, as well as qualitative evaluations on the
   same CTA datasets, from visual scores by a cardiologist expert.}},

Abstract = {{Motion analysis of video data is a powerful tool for studying dynamic
   behavior and determining sources of failures. In the case of failure
   analysis, the available video may be of poor quality, such as from
   surveillance cameras. It is also likely to have been taken from a bad
   angle, with poor lighting, and occlusions may be present. To address
   such cases, this paper presents an optical flow-based tracking algorithm
   incorporating physically-based constraints to extract motion data from
   video. The technique can accurately track a significant number of data
   points with a high degree of automation and efficiency. Many traditional
   methods of video data extraction from poor-quality video have proven
   tedious and time-consuming due to extensive user-input requirements.
   With this in mind, the proposed optical flow-based algorithm functions
   with a minimal degree of user involvement. Points identified at the
   outset of a video sequence, and within a small subset of frames spaced
   throughout, can be automatically tracked even when they become occluded
   or undergo translational, rotational, or deformational motion. The
   proposed algorithm improves upon previous optical flow-based tracking
   algorithms by providing greater flexibility and robustness. Example
   results are presented that show the method tracking machines with
   flexible components, Segway personal transporters, and athletes pole
   vaulting.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of dynamic loading on the residual of
   sandwich structures used in aircraft interiors comprising glass fibre
   phenolic resin face sheets and Nomex (R) honeycomb core. A dynamic
   edgewise compression test method for residual strength testing of
   sandwich structures has been developed using a modified compressive
   Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus. Dynamic edgewise compression at
   strain rates of approximately 50 s-1 for undamaged specimens showed an
   average increase of 26\% in compression strength compared with
   equivalent static edgewise compression tests. For low levels of
   indentation damage there was a 27\% reduction in residual dynamic
   compressive strength compared with a 15\% reduction in residual static
   compressive strength for equivalent prior damage. This new experimental
   method provides insights into the dynamic edgewise response of composite
   sandwich structures to aid in the design and development of future
   aeronautical structures.}},

Title = {{Spectrum of passive scalars of high molecular diffusivity in turbulent
   mixing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{716}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We consider the mixing of passive scalars transported in turbulent flow,
   with a molecular diffusivity that is large compared to the kinematic
   viscosity of the fluid. This particular case of mixing has not received
   much attention in experiment or simulation even though the first
   putative theory, due to Batchelor, Howells \& Townsend (J. Fluid Mech.,
   vol. 5, 1959, pp. 134-139), is now more than 50 years old. We study the
   problem using direct numerical simulation of decaying scalar fields in
   steadily sustained homogeneous turbulence as the Schmidt number (the
   ratio of the kinematic viscosity of the fluid to the molecular
   diffusivity of the scalar) is allowed to vary from 1/8 to 1/2048 for two
   values of the microscale Reynolds number, R-lambda approximate to 140
   and approximate to 240. The simulations show that the passive scalar
   spectrum assumes a slope of -17/3 in a range of scales, as predicted by
   the theory, when the Schmidt number is small and the Reynolds number is
   simultaneously large. The observed agreement between theory and
   simulation in the prefactor in the spectrum is not perfect. We assess
   the reasons for this discrepancy by a careful examination of the scalar
   evolution equation in the light of the assumptions of the theory, and
   conclude that the finite range of scales resolved in simulations is the
   main reason. Numerical issues specific to the regime of very low Schmidt
   numbers are also addressed briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Physical stability is critical for any therapeutic protein's efficacy
   and economic viability. No reliable theory exists to predict stability
   de novo, and modeling aggregation is challenging as this phenomenon can
   involve orientation effects, unfolding, and the rearrangement of
   noncovalent bonds inter- and intramolecularly in a complex sequence of
   poorly understood events. Despite this complexity, the simple
   observation of protein concentration-dependent diffusivity in stable,
   low ionic-strength solutions can provide valuable information about a
   protein's propensity to aggregate at higher salt concentrations and over
   longer times. We recently verified this notion using two model proteins,
   and others have shown that this strategy may be applicable to antibodies
   as well. Here, we expand our previous study to a monoclonal human
   immunoglobulin G1 antibody and discuss both merits and limitations of
   stability assessments based on the diffusional virial coefficient kD. We
   find this parameter to be a good predictor of relative protein stability
   in solutions of different chaotropic salts, and a telling heuristic for
   the effect of kosmotropes. Both temperature and glycosylation are seen
   to have a strong influence on kD, and we examine how these factors
   affect stability assessments. Protein unfolding is monitored with a
   fluorescence assay to assist in interpreting the observed aggregation
   rates. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists

Abstract = {{We characterized the differences in warm-season weekday and weekend
   aerosol conditions and cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes (1995-2008) for an
   80,000 square kilometer region around Atlanta, Georgia, a city of 5.5
   million in the humid subtropics of the southeastern United States. An
   integration of distance-based multivariate techniques (hierarchical
   agglomerative clustering, multiresponse permutation procedures, fuzzy
   kappa statistics, and Mantel tests) indicated a greater concentration of
   CG flash activity within a 100 km radius around Atlanta under weekday
   aerosol concentrations. On weekends, these effects contracted toward the
   city. This minimized any weekly anthropogenic cycle over the more
   densely populated urban center even though this location had a higher
   flash density, a higher percentage of days with flashes, and stronger
   peak currents over the course of a week compared to the surrounding
   region. The sharper contrasts in weekday and weekend lightning regime
   developed outside the perimeter of the city over nonurban land uses.
   Here, lightning on weekend and weekdays differed more in its density,
   frequency, polarity, and peak current. Across the full extent of the
   study region, weekday peak currents were stronger and flash days more
   frequent, suggesting that weekly CG lightning signals have a regional
   component not tied to a single city source. We integrate these findings
   in a conceptual model that illustrates the dependency of weekly
   anthropogenic weather signals on spatial and temporal extent.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamic simulation of thermal nanoimprint lithographic (T-NIL)
   process has been performed to study the effect of the polymer molecular
   size on polymer flow for various mold cavity geometries. First,
   simulations of T-NIL process with several temperature settings were
   performed to determine the optimal temperature for the process.
   Simulations were also done to obtain the size of polymer molecule
   represented by the radius of gyration (R (g)). Then, the relation
   between the R (g) of the polymer and the processibility was investigated
   for various mold cavity sizes. The results showed that there existed a
   minimum cavity size for the R (g) value of polymer for successful
   processing. Based on the results, it was shown that the polymer cannot
   be well patterned if the mold cavity size becomes 2R (g) of polymer or
   smaller. Therefore, it could be concluded that the R (g) value of a
   polymer can be a good indicating parameter when choosing the suitable
   pattern size.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Ischemic mitral valve (MV) repair for patients with severe
   left ventricular dilation remains challenging. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the efficacy of papillary muscle (PM)
   relocation to restore physiologic MV function.
   Methods. Fresh ovine MVs (n = 6) were studied in a left-heart simulator
   under physiologic hemodynamics. Ischemic MV disease was simulated by
   annular dilation and PM displacement. Initial valvular repair was
   performed with mitral annuloplasty; further PM displacement simulated
   progressive left ventricular dilation. Basal PM repositioning (Kron
   procedure), performed to alleviate leaflet tethering, consisted of
   relocating (1) both PMs toward the commissures; (2) both PMs toward the
   trigones; (3) the posteromedial PM toward the ipsilateral commissure;
   and (4) the posteromedial PM toward the ipsilateral trigone. Coaptation
   length and tenting area were measured using three-dimensional
   echocardiography as surrogates of MV function.
   Results. Papillary muscle relocation as an adjunct to mitral
   annuloplasty statistically improved coaptation length and tenting area
   compared with the disease condition. No statistical differences in
   coaptation length and tenting area were observed between final repaired
   conditions and control conditions. No statistical differences were
   observed between commissural and trigonal repairs at any incremental
   repair step. Coaptation length and tenting area were plotted against PM
   distance; the data were fit to linear regressions.
   Conclusions. In a realistic in vitro model of ischemic left ventricular
   dilation, apical-basal PM relocation, as an adjunct procedure to mitral
   annuloplasty, restored optimal MV closure. Trigonal or commissural
   traction suture location did not significantly affect the degree of
   restored coaptation. Linear relationships between PM positions and
   leaflet variables were established, which could be used to inform
   surgical repairs. (Ann Thorac Surg 2013;95:621-8) (c) 2013 by The

Abstract = {{Background. Surgical reconstruction of a flail posterior leaflet is a
   routine mitral valve repair, the techniques for which have evolved from
   leaflet resection to leaflet preservation. Artificial expanded
   polytetrafluoroethylene neochordae are frequently used to stabilize the
   flail leaflet and seldom, translocation of the native secondary chordae
   of the valve to the leaflet free edge is used. In this study, we sought
   to investigate the efficacy of the 2 techniques to correct posterior
   leaflet prolapse and reduce mitral regurgitation, and quantify the acute
   post repair leaflet kinematics.
   Methods. Adult porcine mitral valves (n =7) were studied in a pulsatile
   left heart experimental model in which isolated P2 flail was mimicked by
   marginal chordal transection. Baseline conditions were established in
   each valve under normal conditions (control) and were followed by
   induction of isolated P2 flail by transecting the 2 marginal chordae on
   the posterior leaflet free edge (disease). The flail posterior leaflet
   was reconstructed using artificial neochordae (repair 1) and then native
   chordal translocation (repair 2). Reduction in leaflet flail, changes in
   mitral regurgitation fraction, leaflet coaptation length, and posterior
   leaflet mobility were measured using B-mode echocardiography or color
   Doppler.
   Results. At baseline, all the valves were competent with no mitral
   regurgitation. After transection of the marginal chordae on the
   posterior leaflet, isolated P2 flail was evident with 13.7\% +/- 13\%
   regurgitation. Reconstruction with artificial neochordae eliminated
   leaflet flail and reduced mitral regurgitation to 3.2\% +/- 2.8\%, and
   with chordal translocation leaflet flail was corrected and mitral
   regurgitation was measured at 2.3\% +/- 2.6\%. Using either repair
   techniques, leaflet coaptation and mobility of the repaired leaflets
   were adequate and comparable with the baseline measurements.
   Conclusions. Comparable reduction leaflet flail and regurgitation, and
   restoration of physiologic leaflet coaptation with the 2 techniques
   indicate that under acute conditions, use of artificial neochordae or
   native chordal translocations have similar benefits. (Ann Thorac Surg

Abstract = {{Fabrication of surfaces with heterogeneous contact angle hysteresis
   enables extraction of droplet samples from bulk liquid volumes. These
   surfaces are created by printing high hysteresis wax islands onto low
   hysteresis superhydrophobic paper. The volume of the sampled droplets
   depends on the hysteresis of the printed islands, which can be
   controlled through both physical and chemical means. Physically,
   hysteresis is modified through the addition of surface roughness.
   Chemical hysteresis is tuned by changing the active chemical groups
   present on the wax surface. The observed control of the volume of
   sampled droplets, which is necessary for quantitative biochemical or
   chemical assays, extends to scenarios in which multiple droplet samples
   are extracted simultaneously from a single bulk droplet. Demonstration
   of the capacity of this technique to perform colorimetric glucose
   immunoassays is described. The ability to obtain well-defined microliter
   sample volumes and to extract several samples simultaneously from the
   same source enables the development of two-dimensional paper-based

Abstract = {{The design of power-aware lifetime maximization algorithms for sensor
   networks is an active area of research. However, the standard assumption
   is that the performance of the sensors remains the same throughout the

   the effects of power decay on the performance of individual sensors as
   well as of the entire network. In particular, we examine networks with
   decaying footprints, akin to those of RF or radar-based sensors and
   relate the performance of a sensor to its available power. Moreover, we
   propose probabilistic scheduling controllers that compensate for the
   effects of the decrease in power while maintaining an adequate
   probability of event detection under two sensing models; Boolean and
   non-Boolean. We simulate the performance of the proposed controllers to
   establish that the desired performance levels are indeed maintained

Abstract = {{Unit commitment, one of the most critical tasks in electric power system
   operations, faces new challenges as the supply and demand uncertainty
   increases dramatically due to the integration of variable generation
   resources such as wind power and price responsive demand. To meet these
   challenges, we propose a two-stage adaptive robust unit commitment model
   for the security constrained unit commitment problem in the presence of
   nodal net injection uncertainty. Compared to the conventional stochastic
   programming approach, the proposed model is more practical in that it
   only requires a deterministic uncertainty set, rather than a
   hard-to-obtain probability distribution on the uncertain data. The unit
   commitment solutions of the proposed model are robust against all
   possible realizations of the modeled uncertainty. We develop a practical
   solution methodology based on a combination of Benders decomposition
   type algorithm and the outer approximation technique. We present an
   extensive numerical study on the real-world large scale power system
   operated by the ISO New England. Computational results demonstrate the
   economic and operational advantages of our model over the traditional

Abstract = {{A significantly improved defect-free ester-crosslinkable hollow fiber
   membrane was developed through simultaneous optimization of the spinning
   solution and dry-jet/wet-quench spinning process variables. The
   resultant ester-crosslinked hollow fibers show extremely high separation
   productivity and efficacy with CO2 plasticization resistance under
   aggressive feed conditions. The CO2 permeance was improved from 50 GPU
   to 117 GPU with a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 37 in testing at 200 psi with
   50/50 CO2/CH4 feed, 35 degrees C. Moreover, the crosslinked hollow
   fibers maintain a high CO2 permeance under highly aggressive feed
   pressures up to 800 psi of 50/50 CO2/CH4 feed without CO2
   plasticization. A lower operating temperature can improve the CO2/CH4
   selectivity significantly without apparent loss of CO2 permeance. The
   mixed gas permeation with high CO2 feed pressure demonstrates that
   ester-crosslinked hollow fiber membranes provide a significant advance
   in the state of the art for CO2/CH4 separations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Dense film membranes of the copolyimide 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2) are studied
   for simultaneous removal of CO2 and H2S from sour natural gas streams.
   Pure and mixed gas permeation as well as pure gas sorption data are
   reported at 35 degrees C and pressures up to 62 bar. The H2S partial
   pressures used are representative of highly aggressive field operations.
   Penetrant-induced plasticization effects are evident at feed pressures
   below 1 bar in pure H2S feeds; sub-Tg thermal annealing is used to
   effectively mitigate this effect, and these annealed films are used
   throughout the study. Surprisingly, H2S/CH4 selectivity nearly doubles
   for mixed gas testing in comparison to the pure component ideal
   selectivity values and approaches the level of a state-of-the-art glassy
   polymer, cellulose acetate (CA), at H2S partial pressures above 2 bar.
   Furthermore, permeation experiments using a 9.95\% H2S, 19.9\% CO2,
   70.15\% CH4 mixture at low feed pressures give CO2/CH4 selectivity of up
   to 49-over 30\% greater than the pure component selectivity for
   6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2). The overall sour gas separation performance of this
   polyimide is comparable to high-performance rubbery polymer membranes,
   which have been reported for only moderate H2S partial pressure feeds,
   and is superior to that for CA based on a practical combined acid gas
   separation efficiency metric that we introduce. Finally, methods for
   continued development of the current polyimide membrane material for
   aggressive sour gas separations are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this work we introduce a method to capture the proliferation of
   material defects that carry inelastic deformation, in microstructures
   simulated through isobaricisothermal molecular dynamics. Based on the
   premise that inelastic dissipation is accompanied by a local temperature
   rise, our method involves analyzing the response of a chain of
   NoseHoover thermostats that are coupled to the atomic velocities, while
   the microstructure deforms under the influence of a ramped external
   stress. We report results obtained from the uniaxial deformation of two
   nanocrystalline copper microstructures and show that our analysis allows
   the dissipative signal of a variety of inelastic events to be
   effectively unified via an avalanche of dissipation. Based on this
   avalanche, we quantitatively compare dissipation for inelastic
   deformation under tension vs. compression, observing a significant
   tensioncompression asymmetry in this regard. It is concluded that the
   present method is useful for discerning critical points that correspond
   to collective yield and inelastic flow.}},

Title = {{Study of Intermetallic Growth and Kinetics in Fine-Pitch Lead-Free
   Solder Bumps for Next-Generation Flip-Chip Assemblies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{230-239}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{With continued advances in microelectronics, it is anticipated that
   next-generation microelectronic assemblies will require a reduction of
   the flip-chip solder bump pitch to 100 mu m or less from the current
   industrial practice of 130 mu m to 150 mu m. With this reduction in
   pitch size, and thus in bump height and diameter, the interaction
   between die pad metallurgy and substrate pad metallurgy becomes more
   critical due to the shorter diffusion path and greater stress. Existing
   literature has not addressed such metallurgical interaction in actual
   fine-pitch flip-chip assemblies. This work studies intermetallic growth
   and kinetics in fine-pitch lead-free solder bumps through thermal aging
   of flip-chip assemblies. Based on this study, it is seen that Ni from
   the die pad diffuses to the substrate pad region and Cu from the
   substrate pad diffuses to the die pad region, thus the resulting
   intermetallic compounds at the die and substrate pad regions are
   influenced by the other pad as well. Such cross-pad interaction is much
   stronger in fine-pitch solder bumps with smaller standoff height. It is
   seen that the die pad region contains Ni3P and (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 after
   thermal aging, while the substrate pad region contains Cu3Sn and
   (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5. By digitally measuring the thickness of the interfacial
   phases, the kinetics parameters and the activation energy were
   calculated for the growth of (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 on the substrate side. The
   Cu diffusion coefficient through the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer
   was found to be 0.03370 mu m(2)/h, 0.1423 mu m(2)/h, and 0.4463 mu
   m(2)/h at 100A degrees C, 125A degrees C, and 150A degrees C,
   respectively, and the apparent activation energy for the growth of
   compound layers was 67.89 kJ/mol.}},

Abstract = {{Failures due to conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation in
   copper-plated through-vias have been a concern in printed wiring boards
   since the 1970s. With the continuous reduction in through-via pitch to
   meet high circuit density demands in organic packages, the magnitude of
   CAF failures is expected to be significantly higher. In this study, an
   accelerated test condition {[}130A degrees C, 85\% relative humidity
   (RH), and 100 V direct current (DC)] was used to investigate CAF in two
   organic package substrates: (1) cyclo-olefin polymer-glass fiber
   composite (XR3) and (2) epoxy-glass fiber composite (FR4). Test coupons
   with through-via spacing of 100 mu m and 200 mu m were investigated in
   this study. CAF failures were not observed in either substrate type with
   spacing of 200 mu m. With spacing of 100 mu m, insulation failures were
   observed in FR4, while XR3 exhibited stable insulation resistance during
   the test. The substrates were characterized using gravimetric
   measurement, and XR3 was found to exhibit significantly lower moisture
   absorption compared with FR4. The CAF failures in FR4 were characterized
   using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy. The results suggest a strong effect of moisture sorption
   of organic resins on CAF failure at smaller through-via spacing in
   package substrates.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of margination dependence on hematocrit, platelet

   using the lattice-Boltzmann method, the RBC membranes are modeled with a
   coarse-grained spectrin-link method, and the dynamics of rigid particles
   are updated using Newton's equations of motion for axisymmetric shapes.
   The results emphasize that an increase in hematocrit increases the rate
   of margination. The viscosity ratio between the interior cytoplasm and
   suspending fluid can considerably alter the rate of margination. The
   aspect ratio of surrogate platelet particles influences the rate of
   margination as well. Spherical particles tend to migrate more quickly

Abstract = {{Numerical models of the mitral valve have been used to elucidate mitral
   valve function and mechanics. These models have evolved from simple
   two-dimensional approximations to complex three-dimensional fully
   coupled fluid structure interaction models. However, to date these
   models lack direct one-to-one experimental validation. As computational
   solvers vary considerably, experimental benchmark data are critically
   important to ensure model accuracy. In this study, a novel left heart
   simulator was designed specifically for the validation of numerical
   mitral valve models. Several distinct experimental techniques were
   collectively performed to resolve mitral valve geometry and
   hemodynamics. In particular, micro-computed tomography was used to
   obtain accurate and high-resolution (39 mu m voxel) native valvular
   anatomy, which included the mitral leaflets, chordae tendinae, and
   papillary muscles. Three-dimensional echocardiography was used to obtain
   systolic leaflet geometry. Stereoscopic digital particle image
   velocimetry provided all three components of fluid velocity through the
   mitral valve, resolved every 25 ms in the cardiac cycle. A strong
   central filling jet (V similar to 0.6 m/s) was observed during peak
   systole with minimal out-of-plane velocities. In addition, physiologic
   hemodynamic boundary conditions were defined and all data were
   synchronously acquired through a central trigger. Finally, the simulator
   is a precisely controlled environment, in which flow conditions and
   geometry can be systematically prescribed and resultant valvular
   function and hemodynamics assessed. Thus, this work represents the first
   comprehensive database of high fidelity experimental data, critical for
   extensive validation of mitral valve fluid structure interaction
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale morphogenetic movements during early embryo development are
   driven by complex changes in biochemical and biophysical factors.
   Current models for amniote primitive streak morphogenesis and
   gastrulation take into account numerous genetic pathways but largely
   ignore the role of mechanical forces. Here, we used atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) to obtain for the first time precise biomechanical
   properties of the early avian embryo. Our data reveal that the primitive
   streak is significantly stiffer than neighboring regions of the
   epiblast, and that it is stiffer than the pre-primitive streak epiblast.
   To test our hypothesis that these changes in mechanical properties are
   due to a localized increase of actomyosin contractility, we inhibited
   actomyosin contractility via the Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway using the
   small-molecule inhibitor Y-27632. Our results using several different
   assays show the following: (1) primitive streak formation was blocked;
   (2) the time-dependent increase in primitive streak stiffness was
   abolished; and (3) convergence of epiblast cells to the midline was
   inhibited. Taken together, our data suggest that actomyosin
   contractility is necessary for primitive streak morphogenesis, and
   specifically, ROCK plays a critical role. To better understand the
   underlying mechanisms of this fundamental process, future models should
   account for the findings presented in this study.}},

Title = {{A bibliometric analysis of recent energy efficiency literatures: an
   expanding and shifting focus}},

Abstract = {{To meet the energy requirements of sustainable economic growth,
   policymakers, analysts, and business leaders have increasingly turned to
   the role that energy efficiency might play. This has resulted in a
   growing energy efficiency literature, which is examined in this paper.
   Using bibliometric techniques, we analyze the database of Science
   Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index covering the
   1991-2010 period. Of the 8,244 publications, 78.8 \% were journal
   articles, and about 95.5 \% were published in English. Based on the
   h-index, an evaluative indicator, the USA has produced the most
   influential set of publications on energy efficiency, followed by
   Canada, UK, Japan, and China. In contrast, China is second to the USA in
   the volume of its publications. Correspondingly, the University of
   California at Berkeley, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Tsinghua
   University were the most productive research organizations. The three
   most common subjects examined in this body of research were ``energy and
   fuels{''}, ``environmental sciences{''}, and ``electrical and electronic
   engineering{''}. Energy Policy has been the most productive journal, and
   ``A water and heat management model for proton-exchange-membrane
   fuel-cells{''}, has had the most citations (587 through May 2012). Based
   on an analysis of article titles and keywords, we conclude that the
   hotspots of energy efficiency research have been green communications,
   renewable energy, and energy sustainability; green communications, in
   particular, has developed rapidly as a focus of energy efficiency
   publications in recent years.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{105-120}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Laminar 2-D pulsating flow through homogeneous linear arrays of heated
   square tubes is simulated for pulsation frequencies of 0-80 Hz for tube
   diameter-based Reynolds numbers from 50 to 200. The objective is to
   examine the effects of flow pulsation on drag and heat transfer in heat
   exchanger tube bundles. Cycle-averaged and maximum drag coefficients, as
   well as the instantaneous and cycle-averaged Nusselt numbers are
   reported for each of the ten rows of tubes in the simulated array. The
   results show that flow pulsations can enhance heat transfer in tube
   bundles, and the level of enhancement increases with pulsation frequency
   and mean flow Reynolds number. A wake interference effect has been
   observed which significantly amplifies the drag on the leading rows and
   reduces and instantaneously reverses the sign of the drag force on the
   tubes located in the wake region. Cycle-average drag coefficients
   decreased with increasing Reynolds number and porosity, and were only a
   weak function of pulsation frequency. Peak drag coefficients were found
   to decrease with increasing Reynolds number and porosity, but increase
   with frequency approximately linearly. Empirical correlations are
   presented for a tube bundle with 64\% porosity that relate maximum and
   cycle-average drag coefficients as well as Nusselt numbers to the
   Reynolds number and frequency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Many developers of audio signal processing strategies rely on objective
   measures of quality for initial evaluations of algorithms. As such,
   objective measures should be robust, and they should be able to predict
   quality accurately regardless of the dataset or testing conditions.
   Kates and Arehart have developed the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index
   (HASQI) to predict the effects of noise, nonlinear distortion, and
   linear filtering on speech quality for both normal-hearing and
   hearing-impaired listeners, and they report very high performance with
   their training and testing datasets {[}Kates, J. and Arehart, K., Audio
   Eng. Soc., 58(5), 363-381 (2010)]. In order to investigate the
   generalizability of HASQI, we test its ability to predict normal-hearing
   listeners' subjective quality ratings of a dataset on which it was not
   trained. This dataset is designed specifically to contain a wide range
   of distortions introduced by real-world noises which have been processed
   by some of the most common noise suppression algorithms in hearing aids.
   We show that HASQI achieves prediction performance comparable to the
   Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), the standard for
   objective measures of quality, as well as some of the other measures in
   the literature. Furthermore, we identify areas of weakness and show that
   training can improve quantitative prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal indium tin oxide (ITO) similar to 6 nm nanoparticles
   synthesized in-house were deposited by spin coating on fused silica
   substrates, resulting in high resistivity films due to the presence of
   passivating organics. These films were annealed at various temperatures
   ranging from 150 to 750 degrees C in air and argon atmospheres. The
   films are very transparent in the as-coated form, and they retain high
   transparency upon annealing, except the films annealed at 300 degrees C
   in argon, which became brown due to incomplete pyrolysis of the
   organics. Thermogravimetric analysis and Raman characterization showed
   that the removal of organics increases with an increase in the annealing
   temperature, and that this removal is more efficient in the oxidizing
   atmosphere of air, especially in the 300-450 degrees C temperature range
   than in Ar. Although ITO defect chemistry suggests that argon annealing
   should result in higher carrier concentration than air annealing, the
   faster removal of insulating organics upon annealing in air resulted in
   significantly lower film resistivity at intermediate annealing
   temperatures for films annealed in air than in Ar. At higher annealing
   temperatures, both Ar and air annealing, resulted in comparable film
   resistivities (the lowest achieved was similar to 10(0) Omega cm).}},

Abstract = {{This paper identifies the different friction regimes encountered in
   elastohydrodynamic lubricated point contacts using a quantitative,
   physics-based approach. The idea is to link different traction regimes
   to dimensionless numbers and identify ranges of those numbers where a
   given regime is encountered or dominates the friction response of the
   contact. A numerical investigation of traction in point contacts
   lubricated with a typical mineral oil is employed. The measured
   thermo-physical properties of the oil are used without any modification
   to force agreement with experiments. The authors propose four friction
   regimes delimited by the combined values of three dimensionless
   parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of
   death world-wide. Donor-derived pancreas and Islet of Langerhans
   transplantation are potential cures; however, postmortem ischemia
   impacts islet quality. The murine beta t3 cell line was employed as a
   model to study cell viability and proliferation after hypothermic
   storage by comparing Belzer's Machine Perfusion Solution with Unisol
   (TM) Solution. The objective was to determine which of these solutions
   provided the best base line support for beta t3 cells and to screen
   potential cytoprotective additives to the solutions. Initial beta t3
   cell viability was similar in the two storage solutions; however, better
   proliferation was observed after storage in Unisol Solution. The caspase
   inhibitor, Q-VD-OPH, and alpha-tocopherol improved viability in both
   storage solutions, suggesting that apoptotic pathways may be responsible
   for cell death during hypothermic storage of beta t3 cells. Analysis of
   apoptosis markers, caspase activity, and DNA laddering showed a
   reduction in apoptosis when these additives were included. The effects
   of Q-VD-OPH and alpha-tocopherol were also synergistic when employed
   together during either hypothermic exposure, post-hypothermic
   physiologic incubation, or combinations of hypothermic exposure and
   physiologic incubation. These results suggest that both supplements
   should be included in pancreas hypothermic storage solutions and in
   islet culture media during post-isolation culture prior to
   transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Under-sodium viewing is one of the critical technical issues and
   requirements for the in-service inspection of the sodium-cooled fast
   reactor (SFR) that is currently under development. The waveguide sensor
   that uses leaky A(0) mode Lamb waves has shown its potential for
   high-resolution viewing/scanning of the reactor core and in-vessel
   structures. However, a few problems arise under a liquid sodium
   environment due to high sound speed in liquid sodium and dispersion in
   the long waveguide plate, which simultaneously deteriorate the
   reconstructed C-scan images. This paper proposes coating the surface of
   the waveguide sensor plate with a thin layer of material that has a very
   high ultrasonic wave velocity. It is shown that this coating layer can
   largely reduce the size (width) and radiation angle of the acoustic beam
   from the waveguide sensor. This paper precisely analyzes the effects of
   coating parameters on the beam quality. The proposed idea is validated
   through ultrasonic experiments in which the radiation beam profiles and
   group velocities in waveguide sensors with different surface treatments
   are measured and compared. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   semiconductor,
   poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene)

   conjugated backbones, as well as their separation, evolve linearly with
   temperature, while the side-chain dynamic order parameter and backbone
   paracrystallinity change abruptly upon the (also experimentally
   observed) melting of the side chains around 400 K. The distribution of
   site energies follows the behavior of the backbone paracrystallinity and
   can be treated as static on the time scale of a single-charge transfer
   reaction. On the contrary, the electronic couplings between adjacent
   backbones are insensitive to side-chain melting and vary on a much
   faster time scale. The hole mobility, calculated after time-averaging of
   the electronic couplings, reproduces well the value measured in a
   short-channel thin-film transistor. The results underline that to secure
   efficient charge transport in lamellar arrangements of conjugated
   polymers: (i) the electronic couplings should present high average
   values and fast dynamics, and (ii) the energetic disorder

Abstract = {{Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is applied to pairs of
   hydrogen-bonded nucleobases to obtain the energetic components of base
   stacking (electrostatic, exchange-repulsion, induction/polarization, and
   London dispersion interactions) and how they vary as a function of the
   helical parameters Rise, Twist, and Slide. Computed average values of
   Rise and Twist agree well with experimental data for B-form DNA from the
   Nucleic Acids Database, even though the model computations omitted the
   backbone atoms (suggesting that the backbone in B-form DNA is compatible
   with having the bases adopt their ideal stacking geometries). London
   dispersion forces are the most important attractive component in base
   stacking, followed by electrostatic interactions. At values of Rise
   typical of those in DNA (3.36 angstrom), the electrostatic contribution
   is nearly always attractive, providing further evidence for the
   importance of charge-penetration effects in pi-pi interactions (a term
   neglected in classical force fields). Comparison of the computed
   stacking energies with those from model complexes made of the
   ``parent{''} nucleobases purine and 2-pyrimidone indicates that chemical
   substituents in DNA and RNA account for 20-40\% of the base-stacking
   energy. A lack of correspondence between the SAPT results and experiment
   for Slide in RNA base-pair steps suggests that the backbone plays a
   larger role in determining stacking geometries in RNA than in B-form
   DNA. In comparisons of base-pair steps with thymine versus uracil, the
   thymine methyl group tends to enhance the strength of the stacking
   interaction through a combination of dispersion and electrosatic
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a coherent receiver based on
   simplified heterodyne detection for 100 G polarization division
   multiplexing (PDM) signal. Compared to the conventional homodyne
   detection, only two balanced photo detectors (PDs) and two
   analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used in the simplified
   heterodyne detection. Compared to the conventional hybrid for homodyne
   detection, the polarization-diversity hybrid here is also simplified.
   The in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) separation and corresponding digital
   signal processing (DSP) following downconversion are realized in digital
   domain after ADCs. Using this scheme, we successfully demonstrated 8 x
   112-Gb/s wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM)
   polarization-division-multiplexing 16-ary quadrature amplitude
   modulation (PDM-16QAM) over 720-km single-mode fiber (SMF)-28 with
   heterodyne detection based on DSP and erbium-doped fiber amplifier
   (EDFA)-only amplification. Although the required analog bandwidth and
   sampling speed of the PDs and ADCs are significantly increased for
   heterodyne detection, the benefits from the simplified coherent receiver
   architecture and effective DSP in digital frequency domain are
   experimentally demonstrated. (C)2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach for achieving tightly concentrated optical
   field by a hybrid photonic-plasmonic device in an integrated platform,
   which is a triangle-shaped metal taper mounted on top of a dielectric
   waveguide. This device, which we call a plasmomic light concentrator
   (PLC), can achieve vertical coupling of light energy from the dielectric
   waveguide to the plasmonic region and light focusing into the apex of
   the metal taper(at the scale similar to 10nm) at the same time. For a
   demonstration of the PLCs presented in this paper, we numerically
   investigate the performance of a gold taper on a Si3N4 waveguide at
   working wavelengths around 800nm. We show that three major effects (mode
   beat, nanofocusing, and weak resonance) interplay to generate this light
   concentration phenomenon and govern the performance of the device.
   Combining these effects, the PLC can be designed to be super compact
   while maintaining high efficiency over a wide band. In particular, we
   demonstrate that under optimized size parameters and wavelength a field
   concentration factor (FCF), which is the ratio of the norm of the
   electric field at the apex over the average norm of the electric field
   in the inputting waveguide, of about 13 can be achieved with the length
   of the device less than 1 m m for a moderate tip radius 20nm. Moreover,
   we show that a FCF of 5 - 10 is achievable over a wavelength range of
   700 - 1100nm with the length of the device further reduced (to about
   400nm). (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The shock consolidation response of recently obtained data for a powder
   mixture of Ta + Bi2O3 with previously published results for mixtures of
   Ni + Al, Mo + Si, and Ti + Si are investigated within the context of the
   P-alpha and P-lambda models to determine the applicability of these
   models to highly heterogeneous powder mixtures. The mixtures were found
   to vary significantly in densification path and crush strength
   (pressures required to reach full density), and no one model offers the
   best fit for all the mixtures. The static spherical P-alpha model, which
   uses mechanical properties of the solid materials to predict the
   compaction response for the powder mixtures, was found to provide the
   greatest disagreement with experimental data. By modifying the yield
   parameter to reflect measured yield properties from quasi-static
   densification tests, better agreement between the model and experimental
   data was obtained. For the empirical fitting models, the ability of a
   model to separate compaction into elastic and plastic components had
   minimal influence on goodness of fit. Conversely, homogeneity in
   deformation of the constituent particles was found to promote model
   agreement, specifically for the Mo + Si and Ti + Si powder mixtures
   where dynamically recovered microstructures were available for
   inspection. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

   molecular dynamics study of silicon}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The thermodynamics of homogeneous melting in superheated crystalline
   solids with volume shrinkage at melting is investigated using extensive
   molecular dynamics simulation in conjunction with a classical nucleation
   theory. A liquid-solid co-existing model is established to overcome the
   difficult in observing liquid phase formation in a superheated Si
   crystal. We found that melting is governed by two major factors, the
   volume change induced strain energy and the curvature of the interface
   between the liquid and the solid phases. The driving force for melting
   in superheating regime is lowered by the additional strain energy that
   restricts homogeneous nucleation of a liquid phase till temperature
   rises above the normal melting point, thus causing superheating.
   However, due to the abnormal behavior in the compressibility of the
   silicon liquid in the superheating regime, the degree of superheating in
   terms of the liquid nucleation gap becomes significantly reduced. More
   potential complications caused by the change of the atomic bonding in Si
   at melting are discussed. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

   films are, for the first time, directly hydrothermally grown on a

   thickness and density of as-grown flower clusters can be readily tuned
   by tailoring growth parameters, such as growth time, the addition of
   cations of different valence and size, initial concentrations of
   precursor and cation, growth temperature, and acidity. Notably, the
   small lattice mismatch between the FTO substrate and rutile TiO2 renders
   the epitaxial growth of a compact rutile TiO2 layer on the FTO glass.
   Intriguingly, these TiO2 flower clusters can then be exploited as
   photoanodes to produce DSSCs, yielding a power conversion efficiency of
   2.94\% despite their rutile nature, which is further increased to 4.07\%

Abstract = {{Catalytic materials to dissociate hydrogen molecules play an important
   role in both the large-scale production of hydrogen from gasification of
   coal and efficient storage of hydrogen by metal hydrides. We use
   first-principles calculations together with statistical mechanics
   methods to systematically investigate hydrogen transport properties
   through Mo2C-coated vanadium membranes. We evaluate hydrogen fluxes to
   determine the rate-limiting steps during hydrogen purification with
   these membranes. The existence of a high desorption resistance explains
   the non-Sieverts' behavior observed in previous experiments with these
   membranes and suggests a general rule to select ideal catalysts to
   facilitate hydrogen transport through metal films by spillover.}},

Title = {{A fast least-squares algorithm for population inference}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Population inference is an important problem in genetics
   used to remove population stratification in genome-wide association
   studies and to detect migration patterns or shared ancestry. An
   individual's genotype can be modeled as a probabilistic function of
   ancestral population memberships, Q, and the allele frequencies in those
   populations, P. The parameters, P and Q, of this binomial likelihood
   model can be inferred using slow sampling methods such as Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo methods or faster gradient based approaches such as
   sequential quadratic programming. This paper proposes a least-squares
   simplification of the binomial likelihood model motivated by a Euclidean
   interpretation of the genotype feature space. This results in a faster
   algorithm that easily incorporates the degree of admixture within the
   sample of individuals and improves estimates without requiring
   trial-and-error tuning.
   Results: We show that the expected value of the least-squares solution
   across all possible genotype datasets is equal to the true solution when
   part of the problem has been solved, and that the variance of the
   solution approaches zero as its size increases. The Least-squares
   algorithm performs nearly as well as Admixture for these theoretical
   scenarios. We compare least-squares, Admixture, and FRAPPE for a variety
   of problem sizes and difficulties. For particularly hard problems with a
   large number of populations, small number of samples, or greater degree
   of admixture, least-squares performs better than the other methods. On
   simulated mixtures of real population allele frequencies from the HapMap
   project, Admixture estimates sparsely mixed individuals better than
   Least-squares. The least-squares approach, however, performs within
   1.5\% of the Admixture error. On individual genotypes from the HapMap
   project, Admixture and least-squares perform qualitatively similarly and
   within 1.2\% of each other. Significantly, the least-squares approach
   nearly always converges 1.5- to 6-times faster.
   Conclusions: The computational advantage of the least-squares approach
   along with its good estimation performance warrants further research,
   especially for very large datasets. As problem sizes increase, the
   difference in estimation performance between all algorithms decreases.
   In addition, when prior information is known, the least-squares approach
   easily incorporates the expected degree of admixture to improve the
   estimate.}},

Abstract = {{DNA methylation is an inheritable chemical modification of cytosine, and
   represents one of the most important epigenetic events. Computational
   prediction of the DNA methylation status can be employed to speed up the
   genome-wide methylation profiling, and to identify the key features that
   are correlated with various methylation patterns. Here, we develop
   CpGIMethPred, the support vector machine-based models to predict the
   methylation status of the CpG islands in the human genome under normal
   conditions. The features for prediction include those that have been
   previously demonstrated effective (CpG island specific attributes, DNA
   sequence composition patterns, DNA structure patterns, distribution
   patterns of conserved transcription factor binding sites and conserved
   elements, and histone methylation status) as well as those that have not
   been extensively explored but are likely to contribute additional
   information from a biological point of view (nucleosome positioning
   propensities, gene functions, and histone acetylation status).
   Statistical tests are performed to identify the features that are
   significantly correlated with the methylation status of the CpG islands,
   and principal component analysis is then performed to decorrelate the
   selected features. Data from the Human Epigenome Project (HEP) are used
   to train, validate and test the predictive models. Specifically, the
   models are trained and validated by using the DNA methylation data
   obtained in the CD4 lymphocytes, and are then tested for
   generalizability using the DNA methylation data obtained in the other 11
   normal tissues and cell types. Our experiments have shown that (1) an
   eight-dimensional feature space that is selected via the principal
   component analysis and that combines all categories of information is
   effective for predicting the CpG island methylation status, (2) by
   incorporating the information regarding the nucleosome positioning, gene
   functions, and histone acetylation, the models can achieve higher
   specificity and accuracy than the existing models while maintaining a
   comparable sensitivity measure, (3) the histone modification
   (methylation and acetylation) information contributes significantly to
   the prediction, without which the performance of the models deteriorate,
   and, (4) the predictive models generalize well to different tissues and
   cell types. The developed program CpGIMethPred is freely available at

Abstract = {{The performance of thermally cross-linkable hollow fiber membranes for
   CO2/CH4 separation and the membrane stability against CO2 plasticization
   was investigated. The fiber membranes were thermally cross-linked at
   various conditions. Cross-linking temperature was found to have a
   significant effect, while shorter soak time and the presence of trace
   oxidizer (O-2 or N2O) had a negligible effect. The cross-linked fibers
   were tested using high CO2 content feeds (50-70\% CO2) at a variety of
   feed pressures (up to 1000 psia), temperatures, and permeate pressures
   (up to 100 psia) to evaluate membrane performance under various
   realistic operating conditions. The results demonstrated that
   cross-linking improves membrane selectivity and effectively eliminates
   swelling-induced hydrocarbon loss at high pressures. Excellent stability
   under aggressive feeds (with CO2 partial pressure up to 700 psia)
   suggests that cross-linked hollow fiber membranes have great potential
   for use in diverse aggressive applications, even beyond the CO2/CH4
   example explored in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) is a T = 1 icosahedral virus with
   a single-stranded RNA genome. It is widely accepted that the RNA genome
   plays an important structural role during assembly of the STMV virion.
   While the encapsidated form of the RNA has been extensively studied,
   less is known about the structure of the free RNA, aside from a
   purported tRNA-like structure at the 3' end. Here we use selective
   2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis to
   examine the secondary structure of in vitro transcribed STMV RNA. The
   predicted secondary structure is unusual in the sense that it is highly
   extended, which could be significant for protecting the RNA from
   degradation. The SHAPE data are also consistent with the previously
   predicted tRNA-like fold at the 3' end of the molecule, which is also
   known to hinder degradation. Our data are not consistent with the
   secondary structure proposed for the encapsidated RNA by Schroeder et
   al., suggesting that, if the Schroeder structure is correct, either the
   RNA is packaged as it emerges from the replication complex, or the RNA
   undergoes extensive refolding upon encapsidation. We also consider the
   alternative, i.e., that the structure of the encapsidated STMV RNA might
   be the same as the in vitro structure presented here, and we examine how
   this structure might be organized in the virus. This possibility is not
   rigorously ruled out by the available data, so it remains open to
   examination by experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulative roll bonding (ARB), a severe plastic deformation technique,
   was used in this study to process commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) at
   450 degrees C. Sheet samples were processed by seven consecutive ARB
   cycles, with an overall equivalent strain of 5.6. Mechanical
   characterization and microstructural examination were carried out on the
   processed material to track their changes and relationships with regard
   to one another. Electron microscopy, TEM in particular, revealed
   significant grain refinement in the material, with submicron
   microstructure achieved even after one cycle of warm processing. Further
   processing was shown to progressively fragment the highly elongated
   grains, ultimately producing a predominantly-equiaxed ultrafine grain
   structure with an average grain size of similar to 100 nm. Tensile
   strength and microhardness of the material increased with the number of
   ARB cycles; the strength-grain size relationship followed the Hall-Petch
   equation. The overall grain refinement and strengthening levels observed
   here are close to those reported in the literature for ARB processing of
   CP-Ti at ambient temperatures. This demonstrates the ability of warm ARE
   can be as effective as cold ARB, while offering several advantages for
   industrial utilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools have been extensively applied
   to study the hemodynamics in the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC)
   in patients with only a single functioning ventricle. Without the
   contraction of a sub-pulmonary ventricle, pulsatility of flow through
   this connection is low and variable across patients, which is usually
   neglected in most numerical modeling studies. Recent studies suggest
   that such pulsatility can be non-negligible and can be important in
   hemodynamic predictions. The goal of this work is to compare the results
   of an in-house numerical methodology for simulating pulsatile TCPC flow
   with experimental results. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was
   acquired on TCPC in vitro models to evaluate the capability of the CFD
   tool in predicting pulsatile TCPC flow fields. In vitro hemodynamic
   measurements were used to compare the numerical prediction of power loss
   across the connection. The results demonstrated the complexity of the
   pulsatile TCPC flow fields and the validity of the numerical approach in
   simulating pulsatile TCPC flow dynamics in both idealized and complex
   patient specific models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Single neuron feedback control techniques, such as voltage clamp and
   dynamic clamp, have enabled numerous advances in our understanding of
   ion channels, electrochemical signaling, and neural dynamics. Although
   commercially available multichannel recording and stimulation systems
   are commonly used for studying neural processing at the network level,
   they provide little native support for real-time feedback. We developed
   the open-source NeuroRighter multichannel electrophysiology hardware and
   software platform for closed-loop multichannel control with a focus on
   accessibility and low cost. NeuroRighter allows 64 channels of
   stimulation and recording for around US \$10,000, along with the ability
   to integrate with other software and hardware. Here, we present
   substantial enhancements to the NeuroRighter platform, including a
   redesigned desktop application, a new stimulation subsystem allowing
   arbitrary stimulation patterns, low-latency data servers for accessing
   data streams, and a new application programming interface (API) for
   creating closed-loop protocols that can be inserted into NeuroRighter as
   plugin programs. This greatly simplifies the design of sophisticated
   real-time experiments without sacrificing the power and speed of a
   compiled programming language. Here we present a detailed description of
   NeuroRighter as a stand-alone application, its plugin API, and an
   extensive set of case studies that highlight the systems abilities for
   conducting closed-loop, multichannel interfacing experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Cirrus clouds, thin ice clouds in the upper troposphere, have a net
   warming effect on Earth's climate. Consequently, a reduction in cirrus
   cloud amount or optical thickness would cool the climate. Recent
   research indicates that by seeding cirrus clouds with particles that
   promote ice nucleation, their lifetimes and coverage could be reduced.
   We have tested this hypothesis in a global climate model with a
   state-of-the-art representation of cirrus clouds and find that cirrus
   cloud seeding has the potential to cancel the entire warming caused by
   human activity from pre-industrial times to present day. However, the
   desired effect is only obtained for seeding particle concentrations that
   lie within an optimal range. With lower than optimal particle
   concentrations, a seeding exercise would have no effect. Moreover, a
   higher than optimal concentration results in an over-seeding that could
   have the deleterious effect of prolonging cirrus lifetime and
   contributing to global warming. Citation: Storelvmo T., J. E.

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of finding the best simulated system under a
   primary performance measure, while also satisfying stochastic
   constraints on secondary performance measures. We improve upon existing
   constrained selection procedures by allowing certain systems to become
   dormant, halting sampling for those systems as the procedure continues.
   A system goes dormant when it is found inferior to another system whose
   feasibility has not been determined, and returns to contention only if
   its superior system is eliminated. If found feasible, the superior
   system will eliminate the dormant system. By making systems dormant, we
   avoid collecting unnecessary observations from inferior systems. The
   paper also proposes other modifications, and studies the impact and
   benefits of our approaches (compared to similar constrained selection
   procedures) through experimental results and asymptotic approximations.
   Additionally, we discuss the difficulties associated with procedures
   that use sample means of unequal, random sample sizes, which commonly
   occurs within constrained selection and optimization-via-simulation. (C)

   ppb). The O-3 mixing ratios for weekends were higher than those on
   weekdays at each site by up to 28\%, possibly due to changes in VOC
   sensitivity and reduction in NO levels. In order to better understand
   and characterize the relationship between air masses and O-3 levels,
   cluster analysis was applied to the back-trajectories calculated by the
   HYSPLIT model for the semi-rural site. The analyses clearly showed that
   major transport is characterized by northern and western clusters,
   particularly from the Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, as
   well as recirculation over Istanbul due to high pressure systems leading
   to accumulated levels of O-3. The results clearly suggest that extended
   measurement networks from urban to rural sites should be considered for
   a more comprehensive evaluation of O-3 levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The temperature and humidity dependence of the quality factor of MEMS
   lateral rotary resonators operating in atmospheric air was analyzed and
   measured. The quality factor of a monocrystalline silicon lateral rotary
   micro-resonator was analytically modeled and numerically evaluated based
   on air shear damping loss mechanisms. The effect of temperature and
   humidity on each air damping mechanism was attributed to the
   thermophysical properties of humid air. The damping model predicted
   qualitatively the experimental results for a large range of temperature
   (from 20 degrees C to 80 degrees C) and humidity (from 30\% to 90\% RH).
   These environmental effects can be taken into account for the design of

Abstract = {{The formation of surface species from two- and three-carbon polyols on
   gamma-Al2O3 in the presence and absence of coadsorbed water is
   investigated. Aqueous-phase adsorption isotherms indicate that
   competitive adsorption between water and polyol inhibits the uptake of
   the polyol molecules on gamma-Al2O3 and that the polyol with the most
   hydroxyl groups, glycerol, experienced the greatest uptake. Deuterium
   solid echo pulse NMR measurements support the fact that glycerol
   strongly interacts with gamma-Al2O3 in the presence of physisorbed water
   and that ethylene glycol interacts with gamma-Al2O3 only after the
   physisorbed water has been removed. In situ high-vacuum FT-IR analysis
   combined with DFT simulations demonstrate that glycerol readily forms a
   multidentate alkoxy species through its primary hydroxyl groups with
   coordinatively unsaturated Al atoms of gamma-Al2O3 in the presence of
   physisorbed water. This surface species exhibits a bridging alkoxy bond
   from one of its primary hydroxyl groups and a strong interaction with
   the remaining primary hydroxyl group. FT-IR analysis of 1,3-propanediol
   on gamma-Al2O3 also demonstrates the formation of a multidentate alkoxy
   species in the presence of coadsorbed water. In contrast, polyols with
   hydroxyl groups only on the one- and two-carbon atoms, ethylene glycol,
   and 1,2-propanediol do not form alkoxy bonds with the gamma-Al2O3
   surface when coadsorbed water is present. These polyols will form alkoxy
   bonds to gamma-Al2O3 when coadsorbed water is removed, and these alkoxy
   species are removed when water is readsorbed on the sample. The
   formation of strongly bound, stable multidentate alkoxy species by
   ethylene glycol and 1,2-propanediol on gamma-Al2O3 is prevented by
   steric limitations of vicinal alcohol groups.}},

Title = {{Kinetic Water Stability of an Isostructural Family of Zinc-Based
   Pillared Metal-Organic Frameworks}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{633-642}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The rational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with structural
   stability in the presence of humid conditions is critical to the
   commercialization of this class of materials. However, the systematic
   water stability studies required to develop design criteria for the
   construction of water-stable MOFs are still scarce. In this work, we
   show that by varying the functional groups on the
   1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) linker of DMOF
   {[}Zn(BDC)(DABCO)(0.5)], we can systematically tune the kinetic water
   stability of this isostructural, pillared family of MOFs. To illustrate
   this concept, we have performed water adsorption studies on four novel,
   methyl-functionalized DMOF variations along with a number of already
   reported functionalized analogues containing polar (fluorine) and
   nonpolar (methyl) functional groups on the BDC ligand. These results are
   distinctly different from previous reports where the apparent water
   stability is improved through the inclusion of functional groups such as
   -CH3, -C2H5, and -CF3 which only serve to prevent significant amounts of
   water from adsorbing into the pores. In this study, we present the first
   demonstration of tuning the inherent kinetic stability of MOF structures
   in the presence of large amounts of adsorbed water. Notably, we
   demonstrate that while the parent DMOF structure is unstable, the DMOF
   variation containing the tetramethyl BDC ligand remains fully stable
   after adsorbing large amounts of water vapor during cyclic water
   adsorption cycles. These trends cannot be rationalized in terms of
   hydrophobicity alone; experimental water isotherms show that MOFs
   containing the same number of methyl groups per unit cell will have
   different kinetic stabilities and that the precise placements of the
   methyl groups on the BDC ligand are therefore critically important in
   determining their stability in the presence of water. We present the
   water adsorption isotherms, PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns,
   and BET surface areas before and after water exposure to illustrate
   these trends. Furthermore, we shed light on the important distinction
   between kinetic and thermodynamic stability in MOFs. Molecular
   simulations are also used to provide insight into the structural
   characteristics governing these trends in kinetic water stability.}},

Abstract = {{This letter reports on residual stress measurement in thin crystalline
   silicon wafers with a full-field near-infrared polariscope. Residual
   stress is analyzed in combination with observed surface defects, and the
   results are related to measured fracture strength variation in the
   wafers. Measurements indicate that there is a sawing process-related
   residual stress in the as-cut wafers, and that etch-removal of similar
   to 5 mu m from the wafer surface eliminates a damage layer that can
   significantly reduce the residual stress in the wafer, and therefore
   increases the observed fracture strength. There is a corresponding 2 to
   3 mu m reduction in the observed characteristic defect size after
   etching. Fracture strength anisotropy observed in the wafers is related
   to defect orientation (scratching grooves and microcracks) caused by the
   sawing process. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

   phase at low temperatures (<= 10 K). The polarization and magnetization
   values in the triple phase are calculated to be relatively high (similar

Abstract = {{Nanostructure-decorated n-type semiconductor interfaces are studied in
   order to develop chemical sensing with nanostructured materials. We
   couple the tenets of acid/base chemistry with the majority charge
   carriers of an extrinsic semiconductor. Nanostructured islands are
   deposited in a process that does not require self-assembly in order to
   direct a dominant electron-transduction process that forms the basis for
   reversible chemical sensing in the absence of chemical-bond formation.
   Gaseous analyte interactions on a metal-oxide-decorated n-type porous
   silicon interface show a dynamic electron transduction to and from the
   interface depending upon the relative strength of the gas and metal
   oxides. The dynamic interaction of NO with TiO2, SnO2, NiO, CuxO, and
   AuxO ( x >> 1), in order of decreasing acidity, demonstrates this
   effect. Interactions with the metal-oxide-decorated interface can be
   modified by the in situ nitridation of the oxide nanoparticles,
   enhancing the basicity of the decorated interface. This process changes
   the interaction of the interface with the analyte. The observed change
   to the more basic oxinitrides does not represent a simple increase in
   surface basicity but appears to involve a change in molecular electronic
   structure, which is well explained by using the recently developed IHSAB
   model. The optical pumping of a TiO2 and TiO2-xNx decorated interface
   demonstrates a significant enhancement in the ability to sense NH3 and
   NO2. Comparisons to traditional metal-oxide sensors are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Tailor-made additives, which are molecules that share the same molecular
   structure as a parent molecule with only slight structural variations,
   have previously been demonstrated as a useful means to control
   crystallization dynamics in solution. For example, tailor-made additives
   can be added to solutions of a crystallizing parent molecule to alter
   the crystal growth rate, size, and shape. We apply this strategy as a
   means to predictably control morphology in molecular bulk-heterojunction
   (BHJ) photovoltaic cells. Through the use of an asymmetric oligomer
   substituted with a bulky triisobutylsilyl end group, the morphology of
   BHJ blends can be controlled resulting in a near doubling (from 1.3 to
   2.2\%) in power conversion efficiency. The use of tailor-made additives
   provides promising opportunities for controlling crystallization
   dynamics, and thereby film morphologies, for many organic electronic

Abstract = {{A metal-mediated interprotomer hydrogen bond has been implicated in the
   allosteric mechanism of DNA operator binding in several metal-sensing
   proteins. Using computational methods, we investigate the energetics of
   such zinc-mediated interactions in members of the ArsR/SmtB family of
   proteins (CzrA, SmtB, CadC, and NmtR) and the MarR family zinc-uptake
   repressor AdcR, which feature similar interactions, but in sites that
   differ widely in their allosteric responsiveness. We provide novel
   structural insight into previously uncharacterized allosteric forms of
   these proteins using computational methodologies. We find this
   metal-mediated interaction to be significantly stronger (similar to 8
   kcal/mol) at functional allosteric metal binding sites compared to a
   nonresponsive site (CadC) and the apo-proteins. Simulations of the
   apo-proteins further reveal that the high interaction energy works to
   overcome the considerable disorder at these hydrogen-bonding sites and
   functions as a ``switch{''} to lock in a weak DNA-binding conformation
   once metal is bound. These findings suggest a conserved functional role
   of metal-mediated second coordination shell hydrogen bonds at
   allosterically responsive sites in zinc-sensing transcription
   regulators.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{alpha-Cyclodextrin (alpha CD) was threaded onto 10 kDa poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG), which was then stoppered with bulky end groups
   (4-methoxynaphthyl or 9-anthracenyl-methyl) to give polyrotaxanes
   containing about 38 alpha CD rings threaded onto a PEG backbone. The
   polyrotaxanes were converted into soluble macroinitiators for atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) by esterifying the hydroxyl
   groups of the threaded alpha CDs with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide to a
   degree of substitution (DS) of 8 per alpha CD. Living ATRP of methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) from these polyrotaxane macroinitiators led to
   polymer brushes with molecular weights of up to 1.7 MDa. Polymer brushes
   were observed by atomic force microscopy. Surprisingly, large amounts of
   unthreaded alpha CD star polymer were observed by GPC. The appearance of
   these unthreaded alpha CD star polymers was attributed to the
   shear-induced rupture of the PEG backbone during passage of the brush
   through the GPC column. Backbone rupture also occurred upon heating the
   brushes to elevated temperatures. Proof of the bottle-brush structure
   was further provided without backbone rupture using diffusion ordered
   NMR spectroscopy.}},

   this study is reduced from a maximum of 0.43\% absolute at a barrier
   height of 2.5 eV to basically no advantage at 1 eV. This technique can
   also be used in the optimization of homogeneous emitter solar cells, so
   that contact resistance may be considered in a dynamic way as emitter
   profiles are varied. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The pumping innate to collecting lymphatic vessels routinely exposes the
   endothelium to oscillatory wall shear stress and other dynamic forces.
   However, studying the mechanical sensitivity of the lymphatic
   endothelium remains a difficult task due to limitations of commercial or
   custom systems to apply a variety of time-varying stresses in vitro.
   Current biomechanical in vitro testing devices are very expensive,
   limited in capability, or highly complex; rendering them largely
   inaccessible to the endothelial cell biology community. To address these
   shortcomings, the authors propose a reliable, low-cost platform for
   augmenting the capabilities of commercially available pumps to produce a
   wide variety of flow rate waveforms. In particular, the Arduino Uno, a
   microcontroller development board, is used to provide open-loop control
   of a digital peristaltic pump using precisely timed serial commands. In
   addition, the flexibility of this platform is further demonstrated
   through its support of a custom-built cell-straining device capable of
   producing oscillatory strains with varying amplitudes and frequencies.
   Hence, this microcontroller development board is shown to be an
   inexpensive, precise, and easy-to-use tool for supplementing in vitro
   assays to quantify the effects of biomechanical forces on lymphatic
   endothelial cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   optimized purification polynomials which achieve maximum reduction in
   the LUMO eigenvalue and maximum increase in the HOMO eigenvalue, while
   heading towards idempotency. We demonstrate that optimized purification
   achieves appreciable speedup over traditional purification, which
   increases with decreasing band-gap. We also show improvement over
   non-monotonic purification proposed by Rubensson, while having identical

Abstract = {{Sludge from pulp and paper mills is one of the simplest feedstocks for
   integration of bio-refining technologies. The opportunity to convert
   pulp and paper sludge, a waste stream which represents a cost to mill
   operation, is a good first step into the bio-refinery world. Cellulosic
   sludge has been evaluated at several sites, and the results are
   presented here. Application of enzyme accelerator technology to
   different types of biomass using enzymatic hydrolysis has shown areas of
   potential application in these evaluations.
   The amount of sludge produced favours a pulp and paper mill producing
   only bio-sugars or a small distillation plant shared across several
   mills located close together. The sludge must be characterized with
   respect to ash content, lignin content, percentage of fines, and amount
   of available carbohydrates. The amount of ash can significantly impact
   the cost of (mechanically or chemically) processing the sludge. Based on
   a comparison of results from several groups working to convert sludge to
   bio-sugars or ethanol, the best mill sludge would have less than 8\%
   ash, a lignin content below 7\% (preferably below 4\%), and high fines
   content.
   An enzyme accelerant increases enzyme binding to fibre and can result in
   an approximately 20\% increase in glucose production for the same amount
   of enzymes. This improvement can be used to reduce the time for
   enzymatic hydrolysis or to reduce enzyme dosage or the amount of
   equipment required. Process challenges includes handling sludge at 15\%
   to 30\% consistency to achieve usable concentrations of bio-sugars, good
   mixing to provide best conversion, and designing a process to handle ash
   accumulations effectively.}},

Abstract = {{With the ability to improve grid reliability and reduce overall costs,
   the number of FACTS devices on the transmission grid is growing. With
   advances in power semiconductor technology, the rate of growth is

   the same network, with each trying to control system parameters to
   achieve their own objectives, can introduce high-frequency interactions.
   This paper proposes conditions for controller design that can ensure
   stable operation of multiple controllers. In contrast with a coordinated
   controller design, the proposed approach is independent of other
   controllers at the controller design stage. This paper uses power
   routers (UPFC, SSSC, BTB etc.) and a standard PI controller for

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a parameter-based approach for thermal monitoring of
   direct-torque-controlled (DTC) induction machines (IM), where the stator
   resistance R-s is used as a direct indicator of average stator winding
   temperature. The stator resistance is estimated via the DC current
   injection method. In a DTC drive system, the ultimate challenge is how
   to impose the DC current offset via the existing flux and torque control
   loop. In this paper, the quantitative relationship between desired
   current injection and the corresponding flux linkage offset is firstly
   derived; and the current injection is then achieved by superimposing
   flux linkage offset in the flux control loop. Simulation results
   validate the proposed methodology, and the experimental data proves that
   this method achieves accurate temperature estimation under various
   operating conditions. This simple and efficient thermal monitoring
   technique is particularly advantageous since it eliminates the need for
   embedded thermocouples, requires no hardware change to conventional DTC
   drive systems and has a minimal impact on the IM's normal operation.}},

Abstract = {{As ac-to-ac power conversion becomes increasingly importantly in
   applications such as grid power control and motor control, demand for a
   plug-and-play converter has been increased. Traditional VSI-based
   ac-to-ac power converters such as the back-to-back converter require
   bulky dc-link capacitors that limit their reliability. This paper
   examines a plug-and-play concept for achieving ac-to-ac power conversion
   via the direct-ac/ac power electronic building block (AC-PEBB). The
   AC-PEBB is a compact, self-contained cell requiring no energy storage.
   It can be used in a variety of direct ac/ac converters including matrix
   converters, controllable network transformers (CNT), etc. This paper
   details the design of an 800 V, 100 A AC-PEBB prototype to be used in a
   13 kV, 1 MVA application. Successful test results using several AC-PEBBs

   multiple assets by virtue of its shape which also allows installation
   without interruption of the MV/HV asset. Design methodology of the
   harvester through Maxwell simulations along with a new and efficient
   circuit design for obtaining a regulated DC supply is presented. A
   medium voltage prototype of the proposed E-field energy harvester
   integrated with a wireless voltage sensor is built and tested on a 35 kV

   high energy density. This power is enough to operate a low-duty cycle

Abstract = {{Increases in load, increases in penetration of renewable energy, and
   limited investment in transmission infrastructure are fostering the need
   for a smarter, more dynamically controllable grid. Flexible ac
   transmission systems (FACTs) devices such as the UPFC and BTB are
   difficult to implement at transmission-level voltages due to complexity
   and cost. A direct-ac/ac-converter-based controllable network
   transformer (CNT), because of its fractional converter rating and lack
   of dc storage requirement, is a simpler and less expensive alternative
   for applications involving dynamic power flow control. Scaling of the
   CNT, however, is still a challenge. This paper proposes an approach for
   scaling the CNT to utility-level voltages and currents utilizing
   multilevel topologies as well as direct-ac/ ac power electronic building
   blocks (AC-PEBBs). A comparison of various PEBB-based CNT topologies is

   The switched reluctance machine (SRM), which is an important member of

   novel rotor position estimation method is proposed that requires little

Abstract = {{A practical third harmonic hybrid active filter capable of
   cost-effectively suppressing third harmonic currents in medium voltage
   distribution systems was proposed in {[}1]. The design of the proposed

   building, and testing a 7.2 kV medium voltage experimental
   implementation of the proposed filter. Extensive simulations were
   performed to ensure safe operation of the experimental setup under
   normal operating conditions and during faults/shutdown of the filter.
   Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the performance of
   the proposed filter. The impact of a distributed filtering solution
   based on the proposed filter on a typical residential/small commercial
   distribution system was analyzed using actual utility data. The
   simulation results show considerable third harmonic neutral current and
   neutral-to-earth voltage reduction by deploying the proposed filter.}},

Abstract = {{A novel self-alignment technology, called positive self-alignment
   structures (PSAS), for heterogeneous 3D integration is described. Using
   a set of precisely reflowed photoresist structures in conjunction with
   the corresponding inverse pyramid pits, we demonstrate that submicron
   alignment can be achieved without an advanced placement tool. The
   positive self-alignment structure technology is fabricated on top of
   electronics or devices, and as a result, it does not take up additional
   electronic real estate, and it can be fabricated on any surface,
   including glass. This enables heterogeneous integration that involves
   non-silicon substrates, and at the same time simplifies the stacking of
   three or more chips. This paper describes the self-alignment mechanism,
   the fabrication of positive self-alignment structures (PSAS), and the
   test structures to measure the accuracy of alignment; the resulting
   misalignment on various substrates including glass and unpolished
   silicon surfaces are reported. In addition, the stacking of five chips
   is demonstrated and the resulting misalignment at each of the
   chip-to-chip interfaces is measured and reported.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, problems related to l(1)/nuclear norm minimization
   have attracted much attention in the signal processing, machine learning
   and optimization communities. In this paper, devoted to l(1)/nuclear
   norm minimization as `optimization beasts', we give a detailed
   description of two attractive first-order optimization techniques for
   solving problems of this type. The first one, aimed primarily at
   lasso-type problems, comprises fast gradient methods applied to
   composite minimization formulations. The second approach, aimed at
   Dantzig-selector-type problems, utilizes saddle-point first-order
   algorithms and reformulation of the problem of interest as a generalized
   bilinear saddle-point problem. For both approaches, we give complete and
   detailed complexity analyses and discuss the application domains.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of recognizing handwritten
   mathematical content from classroom videos. Since the handwritten text
   and the accompanying audio refer to the same mathematical characters and
   symbols, a combination of video and audio based recognizers has the
   potential to significantly increase the recognition accuracy compared to
   that of the individual recognizers. In this paper, we propose a novel
   multi-step technique for combining the output of the video and the audio
   based recognizers. Initial recognition results from a video based
   recognizer and a speech recognizer, operating independently on the
   handwritten and the spoken content from a classroom video, are combined
   with a base mathematical speech grammar to arrive at a constrained
   speech grammar that is specific to the content being recognized. The
   constrained speech grammar is then used by the speech recognizer to
   generate the final character recognition results. A subsequent layout
   analysis step, which makes used of audio cues and X-Y cuts based method,
   is used to arrive at the final recognized content. Experiments conducted
   using videos recorded in a classroom like environment are used to
   demonstrate the significant improvement in recognition accuracy that can
   be achieved using our technique.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional data analysis tools support strong computational
   capabilities and numerous standard visualization techniques. However,
   they provide little visual interactions due to the fact that the tools
   maintain a wide applicability to diverse data domains, and thus any
   inherent meanings associated with the data domains are hardly allowed.
   To cover these limitations, we propose to augment Mat lab, one of the
   widely used data analysis tools and computational languages, by imposing
   the capabilities of handling semantic objects so that diverse essential
   interaction capabilities could be allowed such as brushing-and-linking,
   details-on-demand, and dynamic interactive updating on visualization. In
   our demonstration, we will show our audience how to import semantic
   data, how visual interactions are occurred, and how these
   functionalities are convenient using the movie similarity graph data
   set.}},

   a semidefinite cone of dimension 2(Omega(n)) and an affine space. Our

Abstract = {{This work describes the design of a compact 60 GHz SPDT RF switch
   utilizing diode-connected SiGe HBTs. At mm-wave frequencies, SiGe HBTs
   demonstrate better R-off/R-on ratios than CMOS and can be used to
   improve switch performance. A switch topology using a transformer is
   developed to create a SPDT with a small foot print of 190 mu m x 225 mu
   m. The transformer design is discussed and a methodology is presented to
   optimize the matching components of the switch. The switch is fabricated
   on a 180 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology platform featuring HBTs with an
   f(T)/f(max) of 240/260 GHz. The switch achieves 2.7 dB insertion loss
   and 14 dB isolation at 60 GHz with a P1dB and IIP3 of 13.8 dBm and 23.8
   dBm, respectively. This represents a 20\% improvement in insertion loss
   in comparison to a similar 90 nm CMOS switch at 50 GHz. It is also shown
   that the proposed switch can help enable built-in-self-test (BIST)

Abstract = {{RNA-Seq, a deep sequencing technique, promises to be a potential
   successor to microarraysfor studying the transcriptome. One of many
   aspects of transcriptomics that are of interest to researchers is gene
   expression estimation. With rapid development in RNA-Seq, there are
   numerous tools available to estimate gene expression, each producing
   different results. However, we do not know which of these tools produces
   the most accurate gene expression estimates. In this study we have
   addressed this issue using Cufflinks, IsoEM, HTSeq, and RSEM to quantify
   RNA-Seq expression profiles. Comparing results of these quantification
   tools, we observe that RNA-Seq relative expression estimates correlate
   with RT-qPCR measurements in the range of 0.85 to 0.89, with HTSeq
   exhibiting the highest correlation. But, in terms of root-mean-square
   deviation of RNA-Seq relative expression estimates from RT-qPCR
   measurements, we find HTSeq to produce the greatest deviation.
   Therefore, we conclude that, though Cufflinks, RSEM, and IsoEM might not
   correlate as well as HTSeq with RT-qPCR measurements, they may produce
   expression values with higher accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited disease, and SCD
   symptoms impact functioning and well-being. For example, adolescents
   with SCD have a higher tendency of psychological problems than the
   general population. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a
   cognitive-behavioral therapy, is an effective intervention to promote
   quality of life and functioning in adolescents with chronic illness.
   However, traditional visit-based therapy sessions are restrained by
   challenges, such as limited follow-up, insufficient data collection, low
   treatment adherence, and delayed intervention. In this paper, we present
   Instant Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (iACT), a system designed to
   enhance the quality of pediatric ACT. iACT utilizes text messaging
   technology, which is the most popular cell phone activity among
   adolescents, to conduct real-time psychotherapy interventions. The
   system is built on cloud computing technologies, which provides a
   convenient and cost-effective monitoring environment. To evaluate iACT,
   a trial with 60 adolescents with SCD is being conducted in conjunction
   with the Georgia Institute of Technology, Children's Healthcare of
   Atlanta, and Georgia State University.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports experimental results on a surgical grasping forceps
   with a vibration actuator that enhances a tactile perception ability. A
   short-time exposure of tactile receptors to sub-sensory white-noise
   vibration is known to improve perception ability. This phenomenon,
   called stochastic resonance (SR) in the somatosensory system, is
   expected to enhance the sense of touch when the weak vibration is
   applied to a fingertip, and thereby improve associated motor skills. A
   lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuator was attached on the grip of
   surgical grasping forceps. A passive sensory test has been conducted for
   healthy subjects to confirm the efficacy of the device. Statistical
   significance has been observed when appropriate noise is applied. To
   investigate the effect of the noise intensity, a summing network of
   FitzHugh-Nagumo model neurons was built. The simulation results showed
   that a network with relatively large units can improve the detection
   capability of the input signal.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and
   disability in the age group of 0 - 44 years. Though physical exercises
   have proven benefits in the rehabilitation process, the compliance rate
   of patients in the home environment is poor. In this paper we propose a
   system, MotionTalk, which captures and analyses motion data acquired
   using Microsoft Kinect. It is designed to give a real time quantitative
   assessment of the exercises performed by TBI patients at home with
   respect to the same exercises performed in the clinic by utilizing
   relatively inexpensive contactless sensing and dynamic programming
   techniques. In comparison to previous reminder systems, wearable
   systems, and motion capture systems, MotionTalk is less intrusive in
   nature and inexpensive to deploy at home because it is based on readily
   available hardware. This was developed and tested on able bodied
   volunteers and in the future we hope to test it on patients with TBI,
   after IRB approval.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of a study to understand potential barriers
   of geriatric population with chronic illnesses towards adoption of a
   wireless wearable medication compliance system in the form of a
   neckwear. The neck being a critical part of the body can serve as a good
   source to collect a range of health related information on an
   individual. The primary research question we investigate here is this:
   for individuals with chronic illnesses especially amongst the elderly
   population how willing are they to adopt a neckwear system if it can
   monitor and mitigate health complications? Elderly patients deal with
   constant prescription changes over time and this further degrades
   medication compliance and thereby complicates an already wavering health
   status. A semi-structured interview was conducted to better understand
   medication adherence, regimen and issues encountered using reminder
   devices with the goal of informing the design of a new compliance
   monitoring system. Results show that preserving health is one of the
   primary concerns of people living with chronic illnesses therefore there
   is a promising potential for seamless adoption of a neckwear medication
   compliance system with additional capabilities to monitor general health
   status.}},

   Particulate Drug Delivery Systems (PDDS) require better computational
   models. PDDS has been previously abstracted by the same authors as
   Molecular Communication (MC) systems, by solving the advection-diffusion
   problem with time-varying flow. In this paper, this framework is
   extended to solve the nanoparticle-body interactions problem. The delay
   and path loss of the system are expressed analytically. The results are
   validated by finite-element simulations. This model will enable more
   thorough pharmacokinetics than multicompartmental models.}},

   these indexes considering the temporal and spatial complexities of the

   the results with the default rate-distortion algorithms in the H.264/AVC

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) surgical training can be a potentially useful
   method for improving practicing surgical skills. However, the current
   literature on VR training has not discussed the efficacy of VR systems

   this study is to evaluate the benefits of using a low-cost VR simulation
   system for providing a method to increase the learning of surgical
   skills. Our pilot case focuses on laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is
   one of the most common surgeries currently performed in the United
   States and is often used as the training case for laparoscopy due to its
   high frequency and perceived low risk. The specific aim of this study is
   to examine the efficacy of a low-cost haptic-based VR surgical simulator
   on improving practicing surgical skills, measured by the change in the

Abstract = {{Practical techniques for generating test signals between 10Gbps and
   50Gbps are described. An historical review shows that the problem of
   extending ATE to higher rates has been around for several decades, with
   ever-increasing speed requirements. We demonstrate, in this paper that
   multiplexing techniques that permitted 40-50 Mbps testing in the 1980s
   (then using 10-20MHz ATE) can be applied to the present problem of
   achieved 1000x faster rates today (40-50Gbps). Some intervening steps
   are shown that achieved 5-10Gbps, and recently 12-24Gbps. These are

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
   that induce the primary immune response and are responsible for the
   activation of T and B cells. The main function of DCs is to serve as a
   link between the innate and adaptive immunity. Understanding the role of
   DCs in controlling the immune system can provide powerful tools for the
   successful manipulation of immune cells to optimize vaccine delivery and
   to expand possibilities of immunotherapeutic approaches. Nanoparticle
   (NP) applications for targeted delivery of antigens to the DCs is a
   promising strategy for vaccine development. Herein, I present an
   overview of different NPs and approaches of their delivery to DCs,
   review the interaction between NPs and DCs, NP effects on the
   maturation, activation, and function of DCs, and outline future
   directions for NP-enhanced immune control to further foster the
   development of successful vaccination strategies and cancer
   immunotherapies.}},

   performance and substantially reduce its cost Even though thin-film
   photovoltaic (PV) offers significant cost reduction compared to
   traditional bulky thick film Photovoltaics, the overall performance is
   not optimal due to low absorption. Plasmonic light trapping techniques
   introduced recently in photovoltaics can provide better light absorption
   without increasing the device thickness. In this paper, we propose and
   demonstrate a simple plasmonic nanostructure based crystalline silicon
   (C-Si) solar cell by integrating the silver core with Silicon Nanowire
   (NW) to increase the overall absorption efficiency. We have found by
   numerical simulation and 3-D Electromagnetic modeling that for fixed
   filling ratio and length the proposed structure demonstrates 64\%
   improvement in ultimate efficiency and current density compared to the
   conventional NW structures up to 300nm lattice constant}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates an epitaxial silicon based technology from wafer
   to module that can greatly reduce Kerf loss and give high efficiency.
   Porous Si layer was formed on a reusable Si substrate to grow and
   transfer thin epi layers. 17.2\% cell efficiency on thin, 156cm(2) large
   epitaxially grown Si (Epi-Si) wafers was achieved with tabs under
   glass/EVA. This is equivalent to similar to 18.0\% uncapsulated cell
   tested in air, assuming 5\% encapsulated loss. The built-in epi Back
   Surface Field (BSF) gave a Back Surface Recombination Velocity (BSRV)
   value of 500 cm/s. Bulk lifetime of 120us was achieved in similar to
   3ohm-cm epi-wafers and no light induced degradation was observed in the
   cells. Further improvement of back passivation can lead to even higher
   efficiency.}},

   n-type Si cells. Thermal oxidation is often used in photovoltaic to
   remove boron-rich layer (BRL) formed as a byproduct of boron diffusion
   because it interferes with surface passivation. However, oxidizing the
   BRL can cause a severe degradation in bulk lifetime. In this paper, high
   resolution electron microscopy (HREM) was performed to detect the
   presence of BRL after B diffusion and its removal after subsequent
   oxidation. In addition, bulk lifetime of n-type Si with BRL was measured
   after various oxidation conditions to systematically investigate the
   BRL-induced lifetime degradation mechanism in n-Si. The primary metal
   impurity responsible for the bulk lifetime degradation was concluded to
   be Fe in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Leveraging experiences gained from teaching introductory computer
   engineering classes for more than a decade, we have observed many
   students failing to grasp simple operations that are common to all
   computer architecture designs, specifically memory fetches and stores,
   register-to-register arithmetic operations and control/branching
   operations. The notion that any computer breaks down simple statements
   such as i = i + 1 into a number of basic ma- chine language instructions
   to implement the addition and assignment have been equally difficult to
   explain to students. Further, modern computer architectures typically
   have more than one Central Processing Units (CPUS) which operate
   concurrently giving rise to conceptualizing different things happening
   at the same time in a multi-threaded computer program. The concept of
   concurrency is particularly difficult for beginning computer engineering
   students. We believe that one of the root causes of much of this lack of
   understanding is difficulty visualizing and conceptualizing what is
   meant by step-by-step sequential actions for the basic computer
   operations mentioned above and the possibility of two operations to
   operate on the same data at the same time. To assist us with classroom
   explanations we have developed a set of computer-based animations that
   execute simple assembly language programs and show via animation methods
   the actual operation of each of the instructions as the program
   executes. Additionally, with the understanding that popular Internet
   protocols are in fact an extreme example of distributed processing (with
   the actors separated by thousands of miles, with lengthy speed of light
   delays and unreliable links) we have developed a detailed animation of
   the operation of the ubiquitous TCP protocol that helps students
   visualize and conceptualize the algorithms used by TCP for reliability,
   congestion control, and flow control.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy has been applied to probe and map surface species and
   incipient phases on the surfaces of electrodes in fuel cells, batteries,

   report our recent progress in the development of surface enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS) for enhancement of sensitivity to surface species
   and incipient phases on materials used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).
   In particular, we demonstrated that SiO2 shell isolated Ag nanoparticles
   have excellent thermal robustness and chemical stability for SERS study
   of electrode materials at high temperatures, providing information vital
   to understanding the mechanisms of materials performance and
   degradation, thus offering critical insights for rational design of new

Abstract = {{To develop next generation solid oxide fuel cells operated at reduced
   temperatures with a wide variety of hydrocarbon fuels, surface
   modification of electrodes is an effective approach to enhancing the
   performance of both the state-of-the-art Ni-YSZ anode and
   La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes. For example, BaO
   nano-islands on the surfaces of Ni grains greatly improved the
   coking-tolerance of Ni-YSZ anode through a water mediated carbon removal
   process. Similarly, an efficient catalyst layer was created in Ni-YSZ
   anodes when proper amount of BaCO3 was added to the NiO-YSZ anode
   support in the early stage of processing. For SOFC cathodes, a solution
   infiltration process has been used to coat various active catalysts on
   the surface of LSCF cathodes to enhance the catalytic activity and
   stability. The surface coatings include discrete particles of doped
   ceria and samarium doped strontium cobaltite (SSC), and dense,
   continuous thin films of La1-xSrxMnO3-delta (LSM), Pr0.75Sr0.2MnO3-delta
   (PSM), and PrSrCoMnO6-delta (PSCM).}},

Abstract = {{Two polymer solutions of polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and
   Ni(CH3COOH)(2) in dimethylformamide were electrospun into ternary
   composite nanofibers, followed by stabilization and carbonization
   processes to obtain porous carbon/nickel composite nanofibers with
   diameters of 100-200 nm. The study revealed that carbon/nickel composite
   nanofibers were successfully prepared, which allowed nickel particles
   with diameters of 20-70 nm to be uniformly distributed in the carbon
   nanofibers. It was also observed that the fibrous structures with
   particles embedded formed and the fibers broke into shorter fibers after
   sintering. X-ray diffraction indicated that embedded particles
   crystallized with the face centered cubic structure. The
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis revealed that carbon/nickel composite
   nanofibers with meso-pores possessed larger specific surface area than
   that of carbon nanofibers. The specific capacitance of the composite
   nanofiber electrode was as high as 103.8 F/g and showed stable cyclicity
   (73.8\%).}},

Abstract = {{Growth in core count creates an increasing demand for interconnect
   bandwidth, driving a change from shared buses to packet-switched on-chip
   interconnects. However, this increases the latency between cores
   separated by many links and switches. In this paper, we show that a
   low-latency unswitched interconnect built with transmission lines can be
   synergistically used with a high-throughput switched interconnect.
   First, we design a broadcast ring as a chain of unidirectional
   transmission line structures with very low latency but limited
   throughput. Then, we create a new adaptive packet steering policy that
   judiciously uses the limited throughput of this ring by balancing
   expected latency benefit and ring utilization. Although the ring uses
   1.3\% of the on-chip metal area, our experimental results show that, in
   combination with our steering, it provides an execution time reduction
   of 12.4\% over a mesh-only baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Best practices in product design require engineers to perform
   preliminary hazard analyses on the most promising conceptual designs, as
   well as a more rigorous hazard analysis when the details of the product
   are being finalized. When the product is a complex dynamic system that
   interacts directly with a human, the engineers must consider the wide
   range of possible motions and forces that the device could create. Such
   an analysis goes beyond a simple thought exercise and requires detailed
   knowledge about the system dynamics and operating environment. This
   paper presents such an analysis of an inverted-pendulum human
   transporter The list of hazards is constructed by using fundamental
   knowledge of the dynamics and the mechanical design obtained through
   simulation and experimentation. However, the dynamics are so complex
   that the list is augmented with hazards that are revealed by searching
   through accident videos posted on the Internet. The severity of each
   hazard is estimated using an energy-based measurement of the hazard
   onset conditions. While this case study is interesting, it also provides
   a systematic approach to hazard analysis that can be applied to other
   complex and dangerous dynamic systems.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a plume tracking algorithm for a swarm of mobile sensing
   agents in turbulent flow. Inspired by blue crabs, we propose a
   stochastic model for plume spikes based on the Poisson counting process,
   which captures the turbulent characteristic of plumes. We then propose
   an approach to estimate the parameters of the spike model, and transform
   the turbulent plume field detected by sensing agents into a smoother
   scalar field that shares the same source with the plume field. This
   transformation allows us to design path planning algorithms for mobile
   sensing agents in the smoother field instead of in the turbulent plume
   field. Inspired by the source seeking behaviors of fish schools, we
   design a velocity controller for each mobile agent by decomposing the
   velocities into two perpendicular parts: the forward velocity
   incorporates feedback from the estimated spike parameters, and the side
   velocity keeps the swarm together. The combined velocity is then used to
   plan the path for each agent in the swarm. Theoretical justifications
   are provided for convergence of the agent group to the plume source. The
   algorithms are also demonstrated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring of spatially-distributed geo-physical processes
   (e.g., temperature, pressure, or humidity) requires efficient sampling
   schemes, particularly, when employing an autonomous mobile agent to
   execute the sampling task. Many approaches have considered optimal
   sampling strategies which specialize in minimizing estimation error,
   while others emphasize reducing resource usage, yet rarely are both of
   these performance parameters used concurrently to influence the
   navigation. This work discusses how a spatial estimation process and
   resource awareness are integrated to generate an informed navigation
   policy for collecting useful measurement information. We also enable a
   direct comparison between this informed navigation method and more
   common approaches using two performance metrics. We show that our
   informed navigation outperforms these approaches based on performance
   evaluation as a function of estimation error and resource usage for a
   useful range of coverage within the sampling area.}},

Abstract = {{We present a unique multi-antenna RFID reader (a sensor) embedded in a
   robot's manipulator that is designed to operate with ordinary UHF RFID
   tags in a short-range, near-field electromagnetic regime. Using
   specially designed near-field antennas enables our sensor to obtain
   spatial information from tags at ranges of less than 1 meter. In this
   work, we characterize the near-field sensor's ability to detect tagged
   objects in the robots manipulator, present robot behaviors to determine
   the identity of a grasped object, and investigate how additional RF
   signal properties can be used for ``pre-touch{''} capabilities such as
   servoing to grasp an object.
   The future combination of long-range (far-field) and short-range
   (near-field) UHF RFID sensing has the potential to enable roboticists to
   jump-start applications by obviating or supplementing
   false-positive-prone visual object recognition. These techniques may be
   especially useful in the healthcare and service sectors, where
   mis-identification of an object (for example, a medication bottle) could
   have catastrophic consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Several variants of incremental sampling-based algorithms have been
   recently proposed in order to optimally solve motion planning problems.
   Popular examples include the RRT{*} and the PRM{*} algorithms. These
   algorithms are asymptotically optimal and thus provide high quality
   solutions. However, the convergence rate to the optimal solution may
   still be slow. Borrowing from ideas used in the well-known LPA{*}
   algorithm, in this paper we present a new incremental sampling-based
   motion planning algorithm based on Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs
   (RRG), denoted by RRT\# (RRT ``sharp{''}), which also guarantees
   asymptotic optimality, but, in addition, it also ensures that the
   constructed spanning tree rooted at the initial state contains
   lowest-cost path information for vertices which have the potential to be
   part of the optimal solution. This implies that the best possible
   solution is readily computed if there are some vertices in the current
   graph that are already in the goal region.}},

Abstract = {{A compact dual-band rectenna operating at 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz is

   antenna at 915 MHz while keeping dual-band property at 915 MHz and 2.45
   GHz. The rectifier circuit is optimized for low input power densities
   using harmonic balance (HB) simulation. The efficiencies of the
   rectifier are evaluated with both single-and dual-frequency input
   signals. The measured results show an efficiency of 37\% and 30\% at 915

Abstract = {{In a deregulated power system, the need to perform fast multi-area
   available transfer capability (ATC) evaluation emerges. This paper
   introduces a multi-area ATC evaluation method based on system
   decomposition and Kron reduction. The new method is a four-step
   procedure including system decomposition, area equivalencing, data
   exchange and topology checking. The implementation of the new method
   requires only limited information exchanges between different control
   areas and the central coordinator. Due to the distributed nature of the
   new method, the massive calculation of multi-area ATC is broken down and
   parallel computed in each control area in a distributed way. An enhanced
   DC-ATC model is adopted to boost speed with reasonable accuracy. The
   method is validated through both an IEEE 118-BUS test case and a real
   case in East China.}},

Abstract = {{Capacitors are devices for storing electric charge. Several types of
   capacitors have been developed. Conventional dielectric and electrolytic
   capacitors, storing charge on low-surface-area plates, deliver limited
   capacitance but can be operated at high voltages. As an emerging
   technology, electrochemical capacitors (also called supercapacitors),
   storing charge in an electric double layer or at surface
   reduction-oxidation (Faradaic) sites, currently fill the gap between
   batteries and conventional capacitors. They store hundreds or thousands
   of times more charge than conventional capacitors because of a much
   higher surface area and nanoscale charge separation. However, they have
   a lower energy density than batteries and commonly lower power than
   traditional capacitors. Impressive enhancements in their performance
   have been demonstrated in the past decade due to the discovery of new
   electrode materials and improved understanding of ion behavior in small
   pores, as well as the design of new hybrid systems combing Faradaic and
   capacitive electrodes. This chapter presents the classification,
   construction, modeling, advantages, and limitations of capacitors as
   electrical energy storage devices. The materials for various types of
   capacitors and their current and future applications are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In order for stroke victims to gain functional recovery of their
   hemiparetic limbs, facilitation techniques such as the repetitive
   facilitation exercise, or RFE, have been developed. Currently, there is
   a lack of understanding of the neural mechanisms associated with these
   types of facilitation techniques. To better understand the neural
   mechanisms associated with the RFE a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study should be conducted. This paper presents initial
   experimental results testing the feasibility of implementing an
   fMRI-compatible actuator to facilitate a myotatic reflex in
   synchronization with the patient's intention to move the hemiparetic
   limb. Preliminary data from a healthy individual demonstrated the
   feasibility of overlapping the long latency component of the afferent
   myotatic reflex with descending nerve impulses in a time window of 15ms.
   In addition, to implement the RFE into an fMRI-compatible device, a
   pneumatic actuation time delay due to long transmission line was
   evaluated. The results may be used for the assessment of the RFE using
   an fMRI-compatible robotic device in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric transducers have long dominated US transducer technology,
   and current state-of-the-art arrays includes high-quality linear, convex
   and phased array probes. These probes require a large number of
   individually controlled emitting/receiving elements and the associated

   possibility of manufacturing compact and miniaturized probes. The aim of
   this work is to describe how to design a bulk wave piezoelectric
   transducer with beam steering capabilities by simply patterning the
   distribution of piezoelectric material on the active surface and without
   using complex electronic devices. Numerical analyses prove the

Abstract = {{A model based transmit optimization method for Capacitive Micromachined
   Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT) arrays operated in conventional imaging
   mode is presented. For the large signal analysis we used the transient
   CMUT array model presented in {[}1]. As an example, a 15 MHz, 60\% FBW
   CMUT array element with 16 membranes and 70 nm gap is modeled,
   fabricated and tested. Through, fast iterative simulations, the transmit
   behavior of the transducer for the full range of different drive signals
   is explored as a function of DC bias, pulse width, and amplitude for
   unipolar and bipolar pulsed operation. It is shown that for a CMUT
   element operating in the non-collapse mode, the absolute maximum
   possible pressure output is generated when the transducer is driven with
   no DC bias and a very short unipolar pulse that results in full gap
   swing. By adjusting pulse width and amplitude, full gap swing can be
   achieved with small peak pulse voltages, maximizing the transmit
   sensitivity in Pa/V. In all cases, maximum achievable pressure is about
   2 dB of the absolute maximum. The case where the TX and RX elements are
   the same is also investigated where the 95\% of the collapse voltage is
   applied to the transmitting element for optimal receive sensitivity. In
   this case, a bipolar pulse is applied. The first part of the pulse adds
   to the DC bias force to pull the membrane down near the full gap and the
   second part effectively removes DC bias, releasing the membrane to
   achieve largest swing past its rest position. With this strategy,
   absolute maximum pressure can also be achieved with large DC bias
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency ultrasound arrays have applications ranging from imaging
   of small animals, skin and eye to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). We
   describe an application where a guidewire IVUS system uses high
   frequency phased arrays with integrated electronics placed directly on
   the guidewire rather than a catheter for imaging. Multiple arrays
   provide the full transverse cross section of the artery during
   percutaneous interventions. We focus on a 1-D CMUT phased array to be
   used in the guidewire IVUS. CMUTs are particularly suitable for this
   application with their ease of fabrication and single chip electronics
   integration. The array frequency is chosen to be around 35-40MHz with
   10MHz bandwidth so that the 1-D CMUT phased array with a 300um wide
   aperture can closely match the lateral resolution of a current 20MHz,
   3.5F solid state IVUS array. Here we discuss the initial design, large
   signal modeling, fabrication and experimental characterization of a 12
   element, 300x1000um CMUT array with 25um pitch. The electrical and
   acoustic characterization results for a CMUT array with 20um square
   membranes are presented. Modeling results for different size membranes
   indicating adequate performance for higher bandwidth applications are
   also discussed.}},

   of the flexible optimal power flow (FOPF) problem. An advanced solution
   method is also proposed for the flexible optimal power flow problem. The
   proposed grid modeling considers the flexibility of power injections in
   time domain such as charging electric vehicles, smart appliances, data

   moderate electricity prices and hedge the risk of unstable output power
   of renewable energy resources. Financial analysis shows consumers can be
   actively involved in electricity market if the use their flexibility.
   Numerical examples indicate that the FOPF reduces the energy costs, the

Abstract = {{Social networks are important mediums for spreading information, ideas,
   and influences among individuals. Most of existing research work focus
   on understanding the characteristics of social networks, investigating
   spreading information through the ``word of mouth{''} effect of social
   networks, or exploring social influences among individuals and groups.
   However, most of existing work ignore negative influences among
   individuals or groups. Motivated by alleviating social problems, such as
   drinking, smoking, gambling, and influence spreading problems (e. g.,
   promoting new products), we take both positive and negative influences
   into consideration and propose a new optimization problem, named the
   Minimum-sized Positive Influential Node Set (MPINS) selection problem,
   to identify the minimum set of influential nodes, such that every node
   in the network can be positively influenced by these selected nodes no
   less than a threshold e. Our contributions are threefold. First, we
   propose a new optimization problem MPINS, which is investigated under
   the independent cascade model considering both positive and negative
   influences. Moreover, we claim that MPIMS is NP-hard. Subsequently, we
   present a greedy approximation algorithm to address the MPINS selection
   problem. Finally, to validate the proposed greedy algorithm, extensive
   simulations are conducted on random Graphs representing small and large
   size networks.}},

Abstract = {{The 3D video quality metric (3VQM) was proposed to evaluate the temporal
   and spatial variation of the depth errors for the depth values that
   would lead to inconsistencies between left and right views, fast
   changing disparities, and geometric distortions. Previously, we
   evaluated 3VQM against subjective scores. In this paper, we show the
   effectiveness of 3VQM in capturing errors and inconsistencies that exist
   in the rendered depth-based 3D videos. We further investigate how 3VQM
   could measure excessive disparities, fast changing disparities,
   geometric distortions, temporal flickering and/or spatial noise in the
   form of depth cues inconsistency. Results show that 3VQM best captures
   the depth inconsistencies based on errors in the reference views.
   However, the metric is not sensitive to depth map mild errors such as
   those resulting from blur. We also performed a subjective quality test
   and showed that 3VQM performs better than PSNR, weighted PSNR and SSIM
   in terms of accuracy, coherency and consistency.}},

Abstract = {{As the operating frequencies of electronic devices increase, power and
   signal integrity have become a major issue. Simultaneous switching noise
   (SSN) is a major problem that restricts the performance of high speed
   digital systems. SSN leads to voltage fluctuations during data
   transitions which can induce excessive noise. SSN is caused by parasitic
   inductance components in the power delivery network (PDN) that manifest
   themselves through via transitions, apertures on reference plane, split
   planes and even solid planes. A new method has been proposed to address
   this problem, which employs power transmission lines (PTL) that supply
   power to integrated circuits instead of using the conventional
   power/ground plane pairs. This along with current balancing can be used
   to manage return path discontinuities and power supply noise. Many of
   the published work in this area have proved that the PTL concept is able
   to reduce SSN and enhance power and signal integrity. Pseudo-balanced
   power transmission line (PB-PTL) concept has been shown to improve
   performance and reduce power consumption. However, this has only been
   applied to relatively simple test vehicles. In this paper, the PB-PTL
   scheme has been extended for driving multiple I/O drivers in field
   programmable gate array (FPGA) ICs. This paper discusses the theory,
   simulation and measurement results for this implementation.}},

Abstract = {{A review of the analytical models for signal transport in multi-layer
   graphene nanoribbon (GNR) interconnects, current distribution between
   GNR layers, and a comparison of GNR interconnects against copper is
   presented here. The multiconductor transmission line (MTL) models and
   the simplified equivalent distributed RC models presented here consider
   the realistic effect of having contacts that couple only to the top
   layer. The MTL models are used to show the distribution of current among
   different layers along the interconnect length. For digital circuits and
   interconnect dimensions of interest, it is shown that the equivalent RC
   models have an error of less than 15\% in estimating the interconnect
   delay. However, for RF circuits where the accurate frequency response is
   important, it is shown that MTL models are essential. The optimal number
   of GNR layers to minimize the delay and energy-delay-product (EDP) are
   derived using the distributed RC models for futuristic technology nodes.
   Using the predictions made by the International Technology Roadmap for
   Semiconductors (ITRS), it is shown that for short interconnects,
   multi-layer GNR with smooth edges can outperform copper.}},

Abstract = {{Most underwater vehicles are controlled by human operators through
   tethered cables which inhibit range and affect the hydrodynamics. The
   overall performance of these promising vehicles would improve through
   the employment of higher levels of autonomy. Implementation of open
   source autonomous guidance software in an off the shelf underwater
   vehicle is explored here as a solution. Development and implementation
   of this autonomous guidance and vehicle control is greatly facilitated
   through the use of an accurate vehicle simulator. Running real world
   tests of an underwater vehicle is extremely time intensive and error
   prone. The analysis of the vehicle performance underwater is extremely
   challenging with limited accurate positioning sensing e. g. GPS. A
   vehicle simulator allows for faster development of the system by
   providing vehicle performance information prior to expensive real world
   missions. This research presents a method for simulation and testing of
   autonomous guidance and control in a vehicle accurate simulator for the
   VideoRay Pro III underwater vehicle and demonstrates the capability
   through simulated examples and analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Machining performance is often limited by chatter vibration at the
   tool-workpiece interface. Chatter is a type of machining self-excited
   vibration which originates from the variation in cutting forces and the
   flexibility of the machine tool structure. Machining chatter is an
   inherently nonlinear phenomenon that is affected by many parameters such
   as cutting conditions, tool geometry, cutting speed, feed rate, depth of
   cut, overhang length of tool, clamping condition of workpiece. This
   study presents experimental approach for investigation of effects of
   various cutting tool geometry on the onset of chatter. In turning
   process, measured cutting force signal and triaxial accelerometer signal
   was used to know the characteristics of chatter vibration. The static
   and dynamic component of cutting forces reflect onset of chatter
   vibration. Proper selection of tooling is an important parameter in
   terms of chatter elimination in machining.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a nonlinear fusion model to optimally reconstruct depth maps
   from monocular cues. The authors in {[}1] showed the effectiveness of
   estimating depth from individual cues, which saves bandwidth without
   compromising the quality. In this paper, we combine such depth map
   estimates as a Sensor Fusion problem. These depth map estimates are
   extracted from color, motion and texture structure of the scene. We
   address the combination of monocular cues as a nonlinear optimization
   problem with linear constraints. 2D and 3D objective quality metrics are
   used as reliability metrics. At first, we perform Particle Swarm
   Optimization based on PSNR to obtain an initial estimate for the linear
   weights. Then, we use these weights to perform Active-Sets based on
   3VQM. We tested our approach on various video sequences with different
   monocular characteristics. Experimental results show that the quality of
   the rendered views based on combined depth maps is comparable to the
   quality of rendered views based on ground truth depth maps while the
   savings in bandwidth is up to 38.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a method for comparing fixed-route transportation
   systems and demand-responsive feeder transit systems by using passenger
   survey data, published transit schedules, and optimal routing
   techniques. Demand-responsive transportation can be used to improve
   transit service levels in low-demand areas. Because demand in cities can
   vary significantly across the region and by time of day, an effective
   means of determining when demand-responsive services can outperform
   fixed-route services, and vice versa, is needed. This research builds on
   existing comparison techniques that focus on gridded street systems and
   expands the techniques to include all types of street networks, transit
   schedules, and passenger demand levels. The generic techniques are
   presented and a case study is given for Atlanta, Georgia, to determine
   where demand-responsive feeder systems could be implemented to improve
   customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid slosh is a concern for industries that move liquids in rapid or
   precise operations. The majority of existing control techniques utilize
   feedback control to reduce liquid slosh. On the other hand, open-loop
   input shaping has shown to be robust and effective in minimizing liquid
   slosh without the use of sensors. This paper examines through
   experimentation the use of a wide range of input shapers to reduce
   liquid slosh. The container used in the experiments is suspended from an
   overhead trolley and exhibits compound-pendulum dynamics. Test results
   demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of input shaping in
   reducing liquid slosh and the ability to provide fast settling times
   over a broad range of frequency variations. The results also provide a
   thorough comparison of several different types of input shaping. These
   results will help guide engineers working on slosh-control problems.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional bridge cranes waste a large amount of energy because payload
   oscillation causes the operator to move the massive bridge back and
   forth in order to damp out the swing. The energy efficient bridge crane
   (EEBC) is a new crane concept that adds a Micro Bridge fine-positioning
   stage to the typical dual-bridge crane. With this Micro/Macro
   dual-bridge design, there is the potential to save energy and improve
   positioning precision. A planar dynamic model of the EEBC is developed
   in this paper. Then, the dynamic performance of the EEBC is analyzed. An
   input shaper is used to suppress the oscillation of payload and improve
   payload-positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the EEBC has
   the potential advantages of saving energy and improving positioning

Abstract = {{Cranes powered by relay-controlled circuits constitute an important set
   of industrial cranes used throughout the world. Due to their simplicity,
   ruggedness, and long service life, this type of crane can be found in
   older factories or in applications where precise motion control is not a
   strict requirement. However, controlling payload oscillations on this
   type of crane is challenging for two reasons: 1) Relays that can only be
   turned on or off allow for only limited control over the crane trolley
   velocity; and 2) These cranes typically have nonlinear asymmetrical
   acceleration and deceleration properties. This paper presents a method
   for determining the relay switch-times that move payloads with low
   residual oscillation. First, a closed-form equation for the residual
   oscillation given an arbitrary input motion is derived. Second, the
   relationship between crane trolley motion and switch-times is
   established. Finally, numerical searches are used to determine
   minimal-oscillation switch-times.}},

   proposed SSM produces causal, stable, low-order parametric
   representations for the entire signal using a sequence that includes

   highly resonant circuits, such as notch filters and dielectric
   resonators, and it is shown that excellent model corroboration can be

Abstract = {{A wireless sewer sensor network has been widespread to monitor combined
   sewer overflow (CSO) causing human health and environmental hazards. To
   enable the wireless interconnection between sensor nodes, a radiator
   needs to be embedded into a manhole cover with sufficient mechanical
   strength. In addition, the high efficiency in upper hemisphere is
   essential for successful communication to above-ground sensor nodes. In
   order to meet these requirements, a full wavelength slot antenna
   embedded in a shallow cavity inside a cast-iron manhole cover is
   designed. An electromagnetic analysis is conducted to verify the antenna
   design. Simulation and measurement show a good agreement. The result
   shows 2.5dB higher total radiated power in three-dimensional upper
   hemisphere, compared to a half wavelength slot on the same substrate
   without a cavity.}},

Abstract = {{Intra-body electromagnetic propagation through dispersive tissue and
   studies of wireless power transmission have tended to focus on MHz
   frequencies due to relatively lower tissue absorption loss in this
   frequency range. Other studies have focused on the 2.4GHz frequency. The
   Medical Implant Communication Service, a standard specified by the U. S.
   Federal Communications Commission, allows bi-directional radio
   communication between implantable devices using 401 and 406 MHz. Recent
   studies, however, have shown that frequencies in the low GHz range can
   be used for both bi-directional communication and wireless power
   transfer with the lowest absorption loss. This paper presents a
   preliminary study towards the development of an implantable module at
   1.86 GHz. A Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) has been considered as the
   modules' antenna and in order to increase the inherently narrow
   bandwidth, a ground slot is used. The module demonstrates
   omni-directional radiation pattern, it is well matched at 1.86 GHz and
   it has I. S dBi gain. The module's antenna can be easily inkjet-printed
   on conformal materials such as paper and biocompatible LCP.}},

   order to attain a large bandwidth and gain in transimpedance amplifiers

   bandwidth and high gain in a TIA design is the large parasitic
   capacitance associated with the input photo-diode. This challenge can be
   overcome by using a common-base input stage to decrease the input
   impedance and employing a technique to introduce a non-constant
   gain-bandwidth product into the system. The non-constant gain-bandwidth
   product can be realized by utilizing global feedback (as opposed to
   local) with a common-base input stage. The circuit was designed and
   simulated using a complementary SiGe HBT on SOI process technology.}},

   amplifiers. The proposed power amplifier is designed in 65nm CMOS

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the results of a national survey of state
   departments of transportation (DOTs) focusing on the extent to which
   they emphasized multimodal solutions in transportation planning. The
   results offer insights into the size, the scope, and the progress in
   multimodal planning that states have been making since the passage of
   the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. The online
   survey instrument was distributed to all 50 state DOTs; 35 responses
   were collected. Some key challenges that apparently limited the adoption
   of multimodal planning approaches in earlier decades are still
   considered challenges today. The current snapshot of multimodal planning
   suggests that most state transportation agencies still do not use
   evaluation criteria to compare multiple modal options. Not surprisingly,
   constraints and limitations on project eligibility because of funding
   source restrictions were identified as the major limitation to advances
   in multimodal planning and program development, followed by the need to
   follow agency standard operating procedures and by an agency's history
   and culture of highway-dominated planning. However, changes were clearly
   taking place. It is a positive sign that many state officials (20 out of
   35) concluded that real progress had been made in furthering multimodal
   planning objectives during the past 10 years.}},

Abstract = {{Although discrete-time chaotic-map TRNGs, in principle, are capable of
   generating unbiased and uncorrelated random bits, implementation
   variations deteriorate the quality of the output sequence as a result of
   variation of the chaotic map parameters (which result in a non-ideal
   map). In this paper, we introduce an analytical technique to investigate
   the impact of process variations on the randomness of the output
   sequence generated using tent map-based discrete-time chaotic map truly
   random number generators (TRNGs). We validate our results against the
   probability density function (pdf) estimated using extensive Monte-Carlo
   simulations applied to the non-ideal map characteristics. The simulation
   results suggest that the estimation of pdf using our simplified
   theoretical method is in good agreement with that of the Monte-Carlo
   simulations. Finally, the quality of the random bits have also been
   evaluated using the entropy measure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a tunable continuous-time band-pass
   sigma-delta () analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Our design is suitable
   for multi-standard multi-user applications. Additionally, the tunability
   advantage enhances the obtainable resolution while reducing the power
   consumption by only operating in the desired bandwidth from the reserved
   bandwidth required for ADC's application. Our simulation results
   demonstrate that a relatively high SNR can be obtained using the
   designed Sigma Delta ADC. We provide an implementation of the designed
   ADC using Gm-C circuits with 0.18 mu m IBM CMOS technology. The circuit
   operates with 8MHz clock frequency and achieves 57.6dB Signal to Noise
   and Distortion Ratio (SNDR) with 20KHz bandwidth. At the mentioned clock
   frequency and 1.5V supply level, the circuit consumes less than 1mW
   power. Our HSPICE simulation results are in very good agreement with our
   simulated model based on second order modified all-pass transfer
   functions. The effective number of bits obtained from our implemented
   ADC was observed to be ENOB=9.28 bits.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant interconnects have been studied in universities and industry
   over the past decade, as compliant interconnects could mechanically
   decouple the die from the substrate and thus could reduce the stresses
   in the die. In this work, we present the design, fabrication and
   modeling results of three-path electroplated compliant interconnect that
   addresses several of the challenges associated with various other
   compliant interconnects.
   Sample interconnects were fabricated on 4 `' wafers to enable
   experimental validation of the designed microstructures. There were
   about 8300 interconnects on each 20 x 20 mm(2) chip in area-array
   layout. The interconnects were subjected to compliance testing. In
   parallel to the experiments, finite-element simulations were carried out
   to determine the mechanical compliance and the electrical resistance of
   the interconnects as well as their thermo-mechanical reliability. It is
   seen that the out-of-plane mechanical compliance will be more than 1
   mm/N, several orders of magnitude greater than solder bump
   interconnects, and from a reliability perspective, the interconnects
   will last at least 1000 thermal cycles.}},

Abstract = {{We report a novel surface modification method to improve the interfacial
   bonding and compatibility of nanosilica with epoxy matrix. This approach
   utilized a two-layer modification strategy that not only provides a
   layer of functional groups at the surface to match the surface energy of
   nanosilica with epoxy resin, but also generates a large filler-matrix
   interphase transition region by covalent bonding that enables more
   efficient CTE reduction. It is found that dispersion of nanosilica is
   dramatically improved compared to untreated particles. The CTE of
   nanocomposites containing two-layer modified nanosilica is a 5-15 ppm/K
   lower than those filled with conventionally modified nanosilica at the
   similar loadings. Additionally, the nanocomposites developed in this
   study do not show significant Tg reduction. These results show that our
   surface modification method is very promising in developing novel
   nanosilica-based underfills.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the intermetallic compound (IMC) evolution in Cu
   pad/SnAgCu solder interface and SnAgCu solder/Ni pad interface was
   investigated using thermal shock cycling experiments with 100-mu m-pitch
   and 200-mu m-pitch flip chip assemblies. The study mainly focused on the
   size effect of solder joints on the microstructure of IMC. The
   experiments showed that lower stand-off height of solder joint and
   higher thermo-mechanical stress played a greater role on the IMC
   microstructure evolution for the smaller size solder joint under thermal
   shock test. By comparing the IMC growth of 100-mu m-pitch with that of
   200-mu m-pitch solder joints, it was found that on the chip side with Ni
   pad, the amount of (Ni,Cu)(3)Sn-4 reduced gradually with more cycles for
   both cases. However, after 1200 cycles, (Ni,Cu)(3)Sn-4 completely
   disappeared for the 100-mu m-pitch case, while a thin layer of
   (Ni,Cu)(3)Sn-4 still remained for the 200-mu m-pitch flip-chip assembly.
   In addition, the growth rate of (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 was faster for 100-mu m
   pitch on both die and substrate sides, especially before 400 cycles.
   Finite-element analysis also showed that 100-mu m-pitch solder joints
   experienced larger regions of higher stresses under thermal shock. The
   faster IMC growth rate for smaller joints could be explained through
   shorter diffusion path and higher thermo-mechanical stresses.}},

Abstract = {{High thermal conductivity, electrical insulating polymer composite has a

   magnetic alignment of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in epoxy composite
   and the greatly enhanced thermal conductivities of the composites.
   Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are used to modify the
   surface of hBN, making it responsive to the external magnetic field. The
   orientation of modified hBN can be controlled by applying an external
   magnetic field during the curing of epoxy resin. The thermal
   conductivity of 20 wt\% vertically aligned hBN-epoxy composite is found
   to be 104\% higher than the randomly aligned counterpart. This
   dramatically enhanced thermal conductivity is theoretically studied by
   effective medium approximation. The linear coefficient of thermal
   expansion for 20 wt\% vertically aligned hBN-epoxy along the alignment
   direction is as low as 28.7 ppm/K due to the magnetic alignment and
   anisotropic thermomechanical and mechanical properties of hBN. Moreover,
   the polymer composites still possess an excellent processibility. These

   shown excellent RF performance of LCP in the D-band, while the
   microstrip line exhibits a loss of 0.1755 dB/mm at 110 GHz, with a
   monotonous increase to 0.331dB/mm at 170 GHz. An almost constant
   (similar to 2.6) effective dielectric constant is also reported within
   the whole measurement band.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel method to fabricate stretchable RF
   devices in a high-throughput, high definability manner. Silicone with
   high elasticity and high hardness is used as both a dielectric substrate
   and a mold to replicate the pattern from silicon by soft-lithography. A
   silicone based electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) is used as the
   conducting material because of its low electrical resistivity
   (1.6x10(-4) Omega cm) and high elasticity (>500\% elongation at break).
   This novel method is used to fabricate two antennas with different
   dimensions. The antenna has a high efficiency (vertical bar S-11
   vertical bar> 30\%) and the resonance can be tuned to desirable values
   according to the applied strain.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the Harmonic Path (HAPA) algorithm for estimation of heart
   rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) with Impulse Radio Ultrawideband
   (IR-UWB) radar. A well known result is that a periodic movement, such as
   the lung wall or heart wall movement, induces a fundamental frequency
   and its harmonics. IR-UWB enables capture of these spectral components
   and frequency domain processing enables a low cost implementation. Most
   existing methods try to identify the fundamental component to estimate
   the HR and/or RR. However, often the fundamental is distorted or
   cancelled by interference, such as RR harmonics interference on the HR
   fundamental, leading to significant error for HR estimation. HAPA is the
   first reported algorithm to take advantage of the HR harmonics, where
   there is less interference, to achieve more reliable and robust
   estimation of the fundamental frequency. Example experimental results
   for HR estimation demonstrate how our algorithm eliminates errors caused
   by interference.}},

   The quantity and quality of the available data for NILM study are always
   the most critical challenges in this area. Different researchers measure
   data using different data acquisition devices without a standard and
   benchmark. This situation also strengths the difficulty to evaluate and
   compare the identifiers proposed by different researchers. This paper
   will give a full consideration of the different application situations
   of the NILM system, and expend the hardware design from the following
   aspects, sampling frequency selections, sensor selections, power supply
   solutions, and MCU modules. Typical structures of smart metering
   infrastructures are presented at the end of the paper. This will not
   only provide the firsthand materials to new researchers in this area,

Abstract = {{When executing turning maneuvers, manual wheelchair users must overcome
   the rotational inertia of the wheelchair system. Differences in
   wheelchair rotational inertia can result in increases in torque required
   to maneuver, resulting in greater propulsion effort and stress on the
   shoulder joints. The inertias of various configurations of an
   ultralightweight wheelchair were measured using a rotational
   inertia-measuring device. Adjustments in axle position, changes in wheel
   and tire type, and the addition of several accessories had various
   effects on rotational inertias. The configuration with the highest
   rotational inertia (solid tires, mag wheels with rearward axle) exceeded
   the configuration with the lowest (pneumatic tires, spoke wheels with
   forward axle) by 28\%. The greater inertia requires increased torque to
   accelerate the wheelchair during turning. At a representative maximum
   acceleration, the reactive torque spanned the range of 11.7 to 15.0 N-m
   across the wheelchair configurations. At higher accelerations, these
   torques exceeded that required to overcome caster scrub during turning.
   These results indicate that a wheelchair's rotational inertia can
   significantly influence the torque required during turning and that this
   influence will affect active users who turn at higher speeds.
   Categorizing wheelchairs using both mass and rotational inertia would
   better represent differences in effort during wheelchair maneuvers.}},

Abstract = {{Recent study in behavioral ecology reveal that certain species trade-off
   energy and information during various routine activities. This paper
   explores a similar tradeoff between sensing and motion of mobile agents
   tasked with target localization. Specifically, the goal is to balance
   the quality of information collected by sensing agents with the kinetic
   energy expended by their motion relative to the target. Following common
   practice, the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix is chosen to
   represent the information-quality, while the kinetic energy is
   quantified by the usual Newton's laws. We argue that the quality of
   information has a form reminiscent of potential energy, and with such
   interpretation, we mimic the basic laws of mechanics by assuming the
   conservation of the total energy, which is the sum of the potential
   energy and kinetic energy. In this framework, we formulate an optimal
   path problem that aims at increasing the information quality while
   reducing the kinetic energy along the path of the agents. To solve this
   problem, we apply the calculus of variations, only to discover that the
   optimal solutions ( paths) satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equations that are
   well known in classical mechanics. This realization suggests that the
   resulting trajectories may exhibit some well-known phenomena in
   classical mechanics. Simulation results support this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) are emerging as a viable
   solution to the interconnect scaling problem. During early design space
   exploration, a large number of possible partitioning solutions are
   evaluated w.r.t. performance, area, through-silicon-via (TSV) count,
   etc. During this evaluation process, the number of test-TSVs need to be
   added to the total TSV count, to prevent unexpected area overhead later
   on in the design flow. While a fixed test-TSV count may provide
   sufficient guardbanding, in this paper we show that it often
   overestimates the actual number of test-TSVs required. Currently, the
   only way to determine the pareto-optimial test-TSV count is to sweep the
   test-TSV constraint, and repeatedly apply 3D test architecture
   optimization algorithms. This process is time consuming, and is too slow
   to be used in automated partitioning. In this paper, we present a quick
   and accurate estimation of the pareto-optimal number of test-TSVs
   required for a given partition. This can be used as an input to the
   partitioner to quickly estimate the total number of TSVs used for a
   given partition, reducing over-design.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management in 3D ICs not only requires cooling, but may also
   require thermal isolation in scenarios in which high-power chips (e.g.
   logic chips) are stacked along with low-power and temperature-sensitive
   tiers (e.g. memory or silicon nanophotonic chips). A hybrid thermal
   solution combining within-tier microfluidic cooling for the high-power
   tier and within-tier thermal isolation for the low-power tier is
   proposed for the first time. In this paper, we report 1) within-tier
   microfluidic cooling in a processor-on-processor stack 2) TSVs with 23:1
   aspect ratio integrated in the microfluidic heat sink, and 3) the
   integration of air/vacuum cavity in the low-power tier to `protect' it
   from the temperature variation and nonuniformity of the high-power chip.
   Thermal modeling shows that the low-power tier temperature only
   increases by 4 degrees C when the power density of the processor tier
   increases from 50 W/cm(2) to 100 W/cm(2), compared to 22 degrees C
   temperature increase without thermal isolation.}},

Abstract = {{To identify problems that may arise between pilots and automation,
   methods are needed that can uncover potential problems with automation
   early in the design process. Such potential problems include automation
   surprises, which describe events when pilots are surprised by the
   actions of the automation. In this work, agent-based, hybrid time
   simulation and model checking are combined and their respective
   advantages leveraged in an original manner to find problematic
   human-automation interaction (HAI) early in the design process. The
   Tarom 381 incident involving the former Airbus automatic speed
   protection logic, leading to an automation surprise, was used as a
   common case study for both methodology validation and further analysis.
   Results of this case study show why model checking alone has difficulty
   analyzing such systems and how the incorporation of simulation can be
   used in a complementary fashion. The results indicate that the method is
   suitable to examine problematic HAI, such as automation surprises,
   allowing automation designers to improve their design.}},

   Systems have been implemented to track these threats, with varying

   target observation problems. The focus in this new definition is on
   minimizing the time an initial contact for newly generated targets is
   obtained, as opposed to obtaining a contact long after a target has been
   generated. Focusing on the initial contact time provides for the ability
   to enact early countermeasures. A model is provided for the target
   sources, as well as metrics for computing costs associated with the
   model for reallocating robotic agents during an observation task. The
   effectiveness of the solution compared with an existing observation

   Despite its importance, very little research on robot deception has been

Abstract = {{An underwater robotic assistant could help a human diver by illuminating
   work areas, fetching tools from the surface, or monitoring the diver's
   activity for abnormal behavior. However, in order for basic Underwater
   Human-Robot Interaction (UHRI) to be successful, the robotic assistant
   has to first be able to detect and track the diver. This paper discusses
   the detection and tracking of a diver with a high-frequency
   forward-looking sonar. The first step in the diver detection involves
   utilizing classical 2D image processing techniques to segment moving
   objects in the sonar image. The moving objects are then passed through a
   blob detection algorithm, and then the blob clusters are processed by
   the cluster classification process. Cluster classification is
   accomplished by matching observed cluster trajectories with trained
   Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which results in a cluster being classified
   as either a diver or clutter. Real-world results show that a moving
   diver can be autonomously distinguished from stationary objects in a
   noisy sonar image and tracked.}},

Abstract = {{When presented in a practical format, real-time transit information can

   This paper identifies the positive shift realized by the continued

   their effects on the rider experience. In 2012, three years after the
   development of location-aware mobile applications, a survey of current
   OneBusAway users was conducted to compare the results with the previous
   2009 study. Results show significant positive shifts in satisfaction
   with transit, perceptions of safety, and ridership frequency as a result
   of the increased use of real-time arrival information. However, this
   paper also provides a perspective of the margin of error riders come to
   expect and the negative effects resulting from inaccuracies with the
   real-time data. Although riders on average will ride less when they have
   experienced errors, a robust issue-reporting system as well as the

Pages = {{133-141}},
Abstract = {{Several transit agencies are considering accepting contactless credit
   and debit cards directly at turnstiles and bus fare boxes. By using the
   expertise and scale economies of the payments industry, agencies may
   reduce fare collection costs and improve regional interoperability and
   ease of use. One issue with bankcard-based fare collection systems is
   how to serve transit riders who do not have or do not want to use
   contactless bankcards. In this paper, based on Chicago, Illinois, data,
   discrete choice models of the likelihood of transit users to have credit
   and debit cards or to use alternative financial services such as
   currency exchanges are estimated. A significant fraction of transit
   riders in Chicago do not have credit or debit cards; these riders come
   from groups with lower incomes, lower levels of education, and minority
   ethnicities. To meet the needs of this unbanked group of transit users,
   agencies may accept cash fares, agency-issued cards, or payment
   industry-issued prepaid cards that can be loaded with cash at retail
   locations or in rail stations. These options serve unbanked users to
   varying degrees and with different costs to the agency.}},

Abstract = {{Routing is one of the most important and fundamental issues in Cognitive
   Radio Networks (CRNs). In this paper, we propose an effective routing
   scheme. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we propose a
   spectrum-aware Semi-Structure Routing (SSR) framework which incorporates
   power control. By employing forwarding zones and routing zones, SSR can
   effectively utilize the local real-time spectrum dynamics and meanwhile
   guarantee the global routing performance. Second, considering the lack
   of analytical models for routing protocol performance {[}1] in CRNs, we
   analyze the upper bound of the induced latency and scalability of SSR.
   Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the
   performance of SSR.}},

Abstract = {{Recommender systems are increasingly employed by e-commerce websites to
   suggest items to users that meet their preferences. Collaborative
   Filtering (CF), as the most popular recommendation algorithm, exploits
   the collected historic user ratings to predict ratings on unseen items
   for users. However, traditional recommender systems are run by the
   commercial websites, and thus users have to disclose their personal
   rating data to the websites in order to receive recommendations. This
   raises the privacy issue, as user ratings can be used to reveal
   sensitive personal information. In this paper, we propose a
   privacy-preserving item-based CF recommender system using
   semi-distributed Belief Propagation (BP), where rating data are stored
   at the user side. Firstly, we formulate the item similarity computation
   as a probabilistic inference problem on the factor graph, which can be
   efficiently solved by applying the BP algorithm. To avoid disclosing
   user ratings to the server or other user peers, we then introduce a
   semi-distributed architecture for the BP algorithm, where only
   probabilistic messages on item similarity are exchanged between the
   server and users. Finally, an active user locally generates rating
   predictions by averaging his own ratings on items weighted by their
   similarities to unseen items. As such, the proposed recommender system
   preserves user privacy without relying on any privacy techniques, e. g.,
   obfuscation and cryptography. Further, there is no compromise in
   recommendation performance compared to the centralized counterpart of
   the proposed algorithm. Through experiments on the MovieLens dataset, we
   show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Children diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) appear to be at high risk
   for developing neurobehavioral and motor disorders. The most common
   disorders for these children are impaired visual-perception skills and
   motor planning. Besides, they often have impaired executive functions,
   which can contribute to problematic emotional adjustment such as
   depression. Additionally, literature suggests that the tendency to
   develop these cognitive impairments and emotional abnormalities in
   pediatric CP is influenced by age and IQ. Because there are many other
   medical co-morbidities that can occur with CP (e. g., seizures and shunt
   placement), prediction of what percentages of patients will incur
   cognitive impairment and emotional abnormality is a difficult task. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between
   possible factors mentioned above, and neurobehavioral and motor
   disorders from a clinical database of pediatric subjects diagnosed with
   CP. The study resulted in 22 rules that can predict negative outcomes.
   These rules reinforced the growing body of literature supporting a link
   between CP, executive dysfunction, and subsequent neurobehavioral
   problems. The antecedents and consequents of some association rules were
   single factors, while other statistical associations were interactions
   of factor combinations. Further research is needed to include children's
   comprehensive treatment and medication history in order to determine
   additional impacts on their neurobehavioral and motor disorders.}},

Abstract = {{To alleviate the performance degradation of secondary users (SUs) due to
   failed handoff, channel reservation is applied as an efficient way in
   call admission control design in many previous studies on cognitive
   radio networks. However, in a cognitive radio environment, a
   straightforward application of this technique could actually reduce the
   probability of successful handoff, due to its conservative way of
   utilizing time-varying primary spectrum resource. In this work, a
   slotted call admission control scheme integrated with dynamic channel
   allocation is proposed to address the issue. In the proposed scheme,
   admitting user only occurs at the beginning of a new slot; thus, new SUs
   arriving between two slots must first enter a waiting queue until the
   next slot arrives. By imposing a mandatory yet limited waiting time on
   new SUs, the proposed scheme offers an opportunity to allow admitted SUs
   to fully utilize the available primary spectrum. An analytical framework
   using a three-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain is developed to
   analyze the impact of the proposed scheme on both the call-level and
   packet-level performances of SUs. Simulation results verify the accuracy
   of the analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in
   terms of reducing blocking and dropping probabilities, lowering packet
   queueing delay, and improving spectrum utilization efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A massive number of distributed energy resources (DER), battery energy
   storage systems (BESS), and smart appliances (loads) is expected to be
   deployed in the future. To capture the benefits associated with these
   emerging units, this paper proposes an advanced infrastructure that
   allows for an accurate and fast monitoring of the distribution electric
   feeder including various types of residential, commercial, and
   industrial loads. This scheme allows for optimizing the utilization and
   operation of the power system over a short term planning period. More
   precisely, the concept of distributed optimization algorithm through
   decomposing the problem into small parts is used to achieve the outlined
   goals. The enabling technologies that facilitate the implementation of
   the proposed infrastructure are the advanced metering devices and the
   distributed state estimation (DSE). The meters, basically, gather the
   system synchronized and non-synchronized data and send them to the DSE,
   which evaluates the real time model of the system 60 times per seconds.
   The results of the DSE are used to perform the optimization and set the
   controls for the system autonomously.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability analysis of wind farms, especially when considering wake
   effect, has been a challenge due to the intermittency of wind energy.
   This paper proposes a probability state sequence method which utilizes
   the independent probability distribution of each wind turbine to come up
   with the integration of total output states of the wind farm and the
   derivation of reliability indices. When wake effect is considered, the
   method remains unchanged comparing to normal cases but the only
   modification needed is on the representing states for the sum sequence.
   By using the probability state sequence method, the reliability analysis
   can have higher computational efficiency and can be subject to easy
   change of parameters. A studied case has been shown to demonstrate the
   use and effectiveness of the method.}},

Abstract = {{The growing penetration of renewable energy in power system and the
   increasing adoption of demand response have brought about the challenges
   of operation in distribution systems with more uncertainty. Due to the
   intermittency of distributed generation, the centralized control of
   distribution systems must coordinate the operation of distributed
   generation and responsive load in a fast and reliable manner, while
   still attempting to achieve the profit maximization. This paper proposes
   a market based operation method for distribution companies, by smoothing
   out the fluctuating renewable generation with responsive load to ensure
   the reliable feeding of ordinary load. By going through the proposed
   steps which consists of responsive load grouping, mapping and shedding
   in an optimal way, the distribution company is able to perform the most
   economical control over the distributed sources and load. A case study
   demonstrated the use of the proposed method.}},

   selection approach for the alternate configurations discussed. The
   analyzed cost consists of operational cost, acquisition cost and
   maintenance cost. The optimal kV level is selected based on the
   minimization of the total annualized cost of the wind farm. One of the
   proposed alternate configurations is used as a case study to demonstrate
   the cost analysis and optimal kV level selection methods. The kV level

Abstract = {{Increasingly severe I/O bottlenecks on High-End Computing machines are
   prompting scientists to process simulation output data online while
   simulations are running and before storing data on disk. There are
   several options to place data analytics along the I/O path: on compute
   nodes, on separate nodes dedicated to analytics, or after data is stored
   on persistent storage. Since different placements have different impact
   on performance and cost, there is a consequent need for flexibility in
   the location of data analytics. The FlexIO middleware described in this
   paper makes it easy for scientists to obtain such flexibility, by
   offering simple abstractions and diverse data movement methods to couple
   simulation with analytics. Various placement policies can be built on
   top of FlexIO to exploit the trade-offs in performing analytics at
   different levels of the I/O hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate
   that FlexIO can support a variety of simulation and analytics workloads
   at large scale through flexible placement options, efficient data
   movement, and dynamic deployment of data manipulation functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{High response quality is critical for many best-effort interactive
   services, and at the same time, reducing energy consumption can directly
   reduce the operational cost of service providers. In this paper, we
   study the quality-energy tradeoff for such services by using a composite
   performance metric that captures their relative importance in practice:
   Service providers usually grant top priority to quality guarantee and
   explore energy saving secondly. We consider scheduling on multicore
   systems with core-level DVFS support and a power budget. Our solution
   consists of two steps. First, we employ an equal sharing principle for
   both job and power distribution. Specifically, we present a ``Cumulative
   Round-Robin{''} policy to distribute the jobs onto the cores, and a
   ``Water-Filling{''} policy to distribute the power dynamically among the
   cores. Second, we exploit the concave quality function of many
   best-effort applications, and develop Online-QE, a myopic optimal online
   algorithm for scheduling jobs on a single-core system. Combining the two
   steps together, we present a heuristic online algorithm, called DES
   (Dynamic Equal Sharing), for scheduling best-effort interactive services
   on multicore systems. The simulation results based on a web search
   engine application show that DES takes advantage of the core-level DVFS
   architecture and exploits the concave quality function of best-effort
   applications to achieve high service quality with low energy
   consumption.}},

   instantiating a particular model for a class of architectures and sample
   algorithms (three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms, matrix multiply,
   and three-dimensional stencil). Then, as a suggestive demonstration, we
   analyze a number of what-if scenarios within the model in light of these
   trends to suggest broader statements and alternative futures for
   power-constrained architectures and algorithms.}},

Title = {{Use of Reduction-Effectiveness Ratios to Evaluate Reduced Traffic Data
   Collection Plans}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2339}},
Pages = {{13-18}},
Abstract = {{Because of budget shortfalls in recent years, state departments of
   transportation (DOTs) must adjust their traffic data collection plans by
   reducing data collection locations or extending data collection cycles;
   however, few studies have been performed to evaluate the
   cost-effectiveness of various efforts to reduce data collection. This
   study developed a quantitative method for evaluating the impact of
   various reduced plans for traffic data collection on the overall
   accuracy of the annual average daily traffic (AADT) estimation. The mean
   absolute percentage error is calculated to compare the accuracy of 10
   reduced data collection plans with a base plan. In addition, a
   reduction-effectiveness ratio (i.e., the percentage of reduced data
   collection cost to the percentage of increased AADT estimation error) is
   proposed. Results from this study show that the current practice, which
   randomly selects data collection sites on the basis of different cycles,
   performs well in maintaining AADT estimation accuracy but may not be the
   most cost-effective approach. Results also show that certain types of
   sites, such as rural sites, lower-AADT sites, and sites with higher AADT
   variation, tend to produce larger errors if they are not counted. The
   results imply that the proposed method both provides a quantitative
   means with which to evaluate plans for reduced data collection and
   suggests ways to enhance current data collection and traffic estimation
   practices. The method also enriches the information provided to state
   departments of transportation for effective and informed decision making
   with limited resources.}},

Title = {{Tablet-Based Traffic Counting Application Designed to Minimize Human
   Error}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2339}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Abstract = {{Basic traffic counts are among the key elements in transportation
   planning and forecasting. As emerging data collection technologies
   proliferate, the availability of traffic count data will expand by
   orders of magnitude. However, availability of data does not always
   guarantee data accuracy, and it is essential that observed data are
   compared with ground truth data. Little research or guidance is
   available that ensures the quality of ground truth data with which the
   count results of automated technologies can be compared. To address the
   issue of ground truth data based on manual counts, a manual traffic
   counting application was developed for an Android tablet. Unlike other
   manual count applications, this application allows data collectors to
   replay and toggle through the video in supervisory mode to review and
   correct counts made in the first pass. For system verification, the
   review function of the application was used to count and recount freeway
   traffic in videos from the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Initial
   counts and reviewed counts were compared, and improvements in count
   accuracy were assessed. The results indicated the benefit of the review
   process and suggested that this application could minimize human error
   and provide more accurate ground truth traffic count data for use in
   transportation planning applications and for model verification.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel scheme for real-time dynamic equivalencing
   of a power system to preserve the system center of oscillations. It is
   based on real-time dynamic monitoring of the system achieved through the
   implementation of a distributed, substation based, dynamic state
   estimator. The dynamic state estimator utilizes local (substation)
   synchronized and non-synchronized measurements and provides the
   evolution of the dynamic state of the system (real-time dynamic model)
   at rates of 60 times per second. The information provided by the dynamic
   state estimator, is used for the identification of the center of
   oscillations of the oscillating system. The center of oscillations is
   utilized as a reference physical point in the system in order to derive
   a dynamic simplified equivalent of the original system on the other side
   of the center of oscillations. The derived equivalent system mimics the
   dynamics of the original system and can be used for online dynamic
   security assessment of the system. The theoretical background and the
   methodology for the derivation of the dynamic equivalent system are
   provided. The accuracy of the derived dynamic equivalent model is also
   demonstrated.}},

   percentage load served, energy and reserve prices, and system frequency
   deviations under different wind market schemes are evaluated. The
   benefit of having fast reserve from wind is shown in a contingency study
   with loss of generation. The simulation of the proposed combined

   and a mechanism to adjust the impacts from wind plants on grid operation

   congestion in the urban, sporadic congestion algorithm and recurring
   congestion algorithm are presented to simulate in a model of the EV

   distant locations across the system are then added to improve the
   damping of these modes. The design procedure consists of finding the
   optimal parameters for local and wide-area controllers that minimize an
   eigenvalue-based objective function. All controllers are optimized
   simultaneously to improve coordination. The linear power system model
   used for control design is obtained by system identification. The
   optimization problem is solved using particle swarm optimization, which
   has been shown to be effective for designing local PSSs in the past.
   Numerical results for a 16-machine/68-bus benchmark power system model
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing adoption of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generators presents a
   growing challenge to some distribution utility companies, as legacy
   local controls were never intended for high penetration rates. Some
   countries have already begun the process of updating their control
   standards for grid-tied PV systems. This paper presents a low-cost
   distributed control strategy for grid-tied, rooftop PV generators that
   addresses some of the concerns of high penetration PV while also adding
   some benefits to the utility. The control strategy does not require an
   advanced communications infrastructure but still allows for some
   aggregate control of the active and reactive power outputs of the PV
   units and their grid-tied inverters. The paper demonstrates that a
   distribution company that employs this control strategy to address the
   issues of high penetration PV will also be able to gain improved power
   factor correction and potentially new ways to gain revenue from open
   market interactions. Simulations of the control strategy during daily
   load and insolation cycles are presented based on the IEEE benchmark
   13-bus feeder system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an integral control scheme for doubly-fed induction

   integral control optimizes the input signals (machine and converter
   currents) to the reference values with full state feedback so that no
   vague controller parameter (such as PI controller parameters) is needed.
   The reference values are calculated from the control targets, i.e.
   constant power and results in no oscillation, limited overshooting,
   avoidance of overcurrent and so on. Algebraic Riccati Equation is
   introduced to give the solutions for the controller parameters.
   Experiment studies verify the effectiveness of the control strategy in
   improving the transient response for a DFIM system under unbalanced

Abstract = {{This paper provides the analysis of the dynamic behavior of open circuit
   rotor side voltage of doubly fed induction machine during three phase

   side current, of which classical PI control method is studied.
   Analytical solution of the short circuit current of the rotor side
   converter could be obtained. It is concluded from the theoretical
   analysis that the rotor side converter is regulating the current against
   a voltage with an initial value close to the rated stator voltage, thus
   rotor side converter with a higher voltage rating is capable of reducing
   the peak value of the short circuit current. The proposed analysis also
   provides a way to better analyze the low voltage ride through
   capability. In general, the proposed method could be utilized to analyze
   any state space based vector control method under three phase voltage
   dips. The analytical solution is compared with the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new dynamics-based method for image processing in
   coordination with rapid ocular movement. A camera positioning mechanism
   with piezoelectric cellular actuators will be employed to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of this approach. There are a number of mechanisms for
   automatic camera positioning, but few have much in common with the human
   ocular positioning system. When a rapid point-to-point motion is created
   in a camera positioner, like human saccadic motion, the image sensor
   receives blurry images. Existing image techniques rely solely on
   obtained images, or use external sensors to estimate a blur kernel, or
   point spread function (PSF), for motion deblurring. Inspired by recent
   oculomotor studies, this paper proposes a method for estimating PSFs
   directly from the system dynamics of a camera positioning mechanism
   without motion sensors. The proposed method has been evaluated by using
   a single degree-of-freedom camera orientation system. Results are
   compared with conventional methods in terms of speed and accuracy.}},

   Crashes}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2386}},
Pages = {{42-51}},
Abstract = {{Highway safety evaluation has traditionally been performed by using
   crash data, although this method has limitations in terms of timeliness
   and efficiency. Previous studies show that the use of surrogate safety
   data allows for faster evaluation of safety in comparison with the
   significantly longer time horizon required for collecting crash data.
   However, the predictive capability of surrogate measures is still an
   area of ongoing research. Previous studies have often resulted in
   inconsistent findings for the relationship between surrogates and
   crashes, one of the primary reasons being inconsistent definitions of a
   conflict. This study evaluated the effectiveness of postencroachment
   time (PET) as a surrogate measure for the propensity of crashes between
   left-turning vehicles and opposing through vehicles at four-leg
   signalized intersections. The primary method of data collection was
   through video recording with post-processing. Custom semiautomatic video
   processing software was used to reduce the video to a us able format for
   analysis. The study evaluated the effectiveness of PET as a surrogate
   measure by comparing three variations of the PET measure with crash
   history. This comparison showed that the threshold value of PET played
   an important role in establishing its correlation with crashes, with the
   best results at a threshold as low as 1 s.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an original control algorithm for a parallel plug-in
   hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain. Two operational strategies using
   this algorithm are designated as EV/CS (battery-only operation followed
   by charge sustaining operation) and CD/CS (charge depleting blended
   operation followed by charge sustaining operation) with the same control
   algorithm used throughout both. An algebraic mapping of three observable
   variables outputs a single motor torque-command that can either propel
   or regeneratively brake the vehicle. This mapping is on-line feasible in
   real time, avoiding the use of look-up tables or some computationally
   complex optimization approach involving searches over an admissible
   control space. Another important feature of this methodology is that the
   highly developed engine and transmission controls of non-hybrid
   powertrains are essentially maintained. Using a Simulink model, the fuel
   economy and SOC (state-of-charge) as a function of driving distance for
   both strategies are presented. Most importantly, results of recorded
   on-road SOC data are included that shows practicality on a real vehicle
   in a real driving situation over 96 miles. Also presented are simulated
   and real driving acceleration results.}},

Abstract = {{We propose using a matched pair of linear diaphragm accelerometers in
   order to capture angular velocity data for use in a vestibular
   prosthesis. Each sensor transduces linear acceleration into deflection
   of the membrane. This deflection changes the distance between the plates
   and concordantly their capacitance. Through analytic equations of motion
   and finite element analysis we show that such a sensor design will allow
   for sufficient sensitivity for a vestibular prosthesis. By placing two
   accelerometers in such a way that they are parallel, within the same
   plane, and share a perpendicular axis, we can derive angular
   acceleration, and through signal processing, angular velocity. In such a
   configuration, linear accelerations will be rejected by taking the
   difference between the measured capacitances, while angular acceleration
   data will be accepted. Physical analysis shows that this scheme will
   generate the requisite data.}},

Abstract = {{Sensory prostheses must encode complex surrogate sensory signals as
   patterns of microstimulation, and yet no established framework exists
   for quantifying the information delivered to the brain. Here we develop
   a Bayesian decoder based on the underlying anatomy in cortex and
   evaluate it on population neural activity recorded from the vibrissa
   region of rodent primary somatosensory cortex with voltage sensitive dye
   imaging in response to intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). The
   anatomically based decoder accurately classified stimulus location from
   the multi-electrode array, indicating a degree of similarity between the
   whisker evoked neural response and that generated by intracortical
   microstimulation. However, when the decoder was modified to discriminate
   between whisker and electrical stimuli, it did so with high performance.
   Ultimately, the results presented here establish the beginnings of a
   generalized decoding framework for evaluating stimulus encoding models
   designed to deliver surrogate sensory signals to the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of neuroplasticity indicate that areas of the brain not injured

   We have combined two advanced technologies, a robotic hand therapy

   effects of the wearable Tongue Drive System paired with the Hand Mentor
   therapeutic robot (TDS-HM) on improving upper extremity motor functions
   in stroke survivors with severe hemiparesis. For this pilot study, a
   TDS-HM prototype was constructed and evaluated by three able-bodied
   subjects with a set of graphical user interfaces. The tongue movements
   were translated to wrist motion based on three control modes: discrete
   (CDC), semi-proportional (DPC), and proportional (RPC). Preliminary
   results showed that the TDS-HM worked reliably with all three control
   modes, and three healthy subjects showed average RMS deviations of 7.09
   +/- 1.09, 6.19 +/- 1.41, and 7.06 +/- 1.78 degrees from a given
   sinusoidal target path in these modes, respectively. They also played
   three flash games using the TDS-HM in the three control modes, and

Abstract = {{A vertical array titanium dioxide nanotube (n-TiO2) for photovoltaic
   materials in dye sensitized solar cell has been synthesized by
   electrochemical anodization technique in NH4F aqueous solution. The
   morphological observation performed by SEM analysis on the scratch film
   showed that the distribution growths of TiO2 nanotubes on Ti subtract
   were uniform. The duration of growth is varied up to 12 h, with tubes
   length approximately 1 mu m. However, at the maximum duration, a compact
   TiO2 layers were formed. This phenomenon is due to the field-assisted
   anodic oxidation at the interfaces of Ti/TiO2 is at equal rate with the
   field-assisted dissolution rate of the top TiO2 nanotube's surface,
   resulting from the decreased quantity of F(-)ions to form fluoro
   complexes, {[}TiF6](2-). A slight increase in the rate of the chemical
   dissolution reaction produced a precipitated TiO2. Hence, {[}TiF6](2-).

Abstract = {{Strategies to recruit and retain underrepresented students in the STEM
   fields are as diverse as the students they seek to engage. The community
   college pipeline is well recognized as a source for both nontraditional
   and underrepresented students for engineering programs. The Transfer
   Initiative for Engineering Scholars (TIES) addresses the unique needs of
   this cohort who transfer as juniors from the community college
   environment. TIES is currently in the fourth year of receiving funding
   from NSF's S-STEM program and providing financial support to eligible
   students in an environment committed to smooth transitions, multiple
   options for student support services, community building with peers and
   faculty, leadership development, and mentor relationships. Many of the
   support activities build upon previously existing retention programs,
   but new components, such as leadership seminars, community building, and
   industry mentoring, were developed specifically for TIES participants.
   Among the several components of the program, those that contribute to a
   supportive community environment were seen by the students as extremely
   important for a successful transition to Georgia Tech's undergraduate
   electrical engineering and computer engineering programs.}},

Abstract = {{Design-by-analogy is considered to be a powerful tool for engineering
   design. The difficulty of finding suitable analogies for solving a given
   design problem gives rise to the current efforts on computational tools
   for analogy-based design. In searching for analogies, the critical
   functions in a design problem are potential search criteria. The study
   described in this paper investigates whether novice designers identify
   an expert-derived critical function in a design problem under three
   scenarios: when they are asked to report the important functions in the
   problem, when they are directly asked to report the critical function
   and when they are asked to use design-by-analogy. It is observed that
   student designers do not identify the expert-derived critical functions
   when directly asked or when asked to list important functions. However,
   they inherently use the expert-derived critical functions in their
   analogical mapping process. This suggests that, during analogical
   reasoning, designers tend to identify and use the same critical
   functions regardless of experience, and also that critical functions are
   valid search criteria for deriving analogies from a computational
   database. This insight is highly valuable for current efforts to develop
   computational tools for analogical reasoning.}},

   prove the efficacy of building-level demand response in microgrid

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an experimental study exploiting structural
   Bayesian adaptation for handling potential mismatches between training
   and test conditions for real-world applications to be realized in our
   multilingual very large vocabulary speech recognition (VLVSR) system
   project sponsored by MOTIE (The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy),
   Republic of Korea. The goal of the project is to construct a
   national-wide VLVSR cloud service platform for mobile applications.
   Besides system architecture design issues, at such a large scale,
   performance robustness problems, caused by mismatches in speakers,
   tasks, environments, and domains, etc., need to be taken into account
   very carefully as well. We decide to adopt adaptation, especially the
   structural MAP, techniques to reduce system accuracy degradation caused
   by these mismatches. Being part of an ongoing project, we describe how
   structural MAP approaches can be used for adaptation of both acoustic
   and language models for our VLVSR systems, and provide convincing
   experimental results to demonstrate how adaptation can be utilized to
   bridge the performance gap between the current state-of-the-art and
   deployable VLVSR systems.}},

Abstract = {{Answering what is the bare minimum combination of avionics and vehicle
   platform design that enables useful autonomous indoor flight without a
   Global Positioning System (GPS) is required to understand the lower-cost
   bounds for indoor unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology. The GT Lama
   indoor UAS, capable of autonomously exploring indoor areas in the
   GPS-denied environment discussed here, was designed in an attempt to
   answer this question. The GT Lama weighs around 600 g (1.3 lb), has a
   diameter of approximately 70 cm (27.6 in.), and costs less than 900 U.
   S. dollars. Cost and weight savings are realized through development of
   an innovative indoor guidance, navigation, and control algorithm that
   uses only five small off-the-shelf low-cost range sensors rather than
   expensive and sophisticated sensors such as inertial measurement units,
   scanning laser range sensors, and GPS. The onboard software leverages
   the inherent stability of the coaxial rotorcraft platform and fuses
   information from the low-fidelity range sensors to detect and follow
   walls and other stationary obstacles. The algorithms are designed to
   encourage maximum exploration of the perimeter of an indoor environment
   in a reasonable amount of time. The avionics design and the guidance,
   navigation, and control algorithms used are discussed in detail and
   validated through flight tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents for the first time, the use of a microfluidic

   designs at 915 MHz (dipole and loop). The channel was created by
   drilling a cavity on a 50 mil RO3003 (TM) substrate and bonding it to
   two 5 mil substrates in order to seal the structure. Compared to designs
   fabricated on an unperturbed substrate, the overall size reduction in
   length for the dipole with water-filled channel was similar to 44\% (60
   mm), while a 54\% reduction in area was observed for its loop
   counterpart. Broad bandwidths of 22\% and 11\% were achieved for the
   water loaded dipole and loop, respectively. The results obtained for
   both designs agreed well with simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The first design for a monolithic FMCW Ground Penetrating Radar system
   integrated onto an inkjet-printed patterned flexible substrate is
   presented. Using advanced materials printing and surface mounting
   techniques, each signal stage, including the antennas, can be built onto
   one continuous portable conformal substrate. This would make radar
   systems easy to roll up to miniaturized highly-portable sizes and
   volumes, that are really critical especially in ``rugged{''} and
   hazardous remote environments. This paper addresses several design
   challenges involved in the development of monolithic paper-based radar
   systems including unique design, fabrication, and testing procedures
   that differ from the conventional radar systems. A paper-based mixer
   circuit is built and the performance is to be compared to that of a
   state of the art mixer board to verify the advantages of the newly
   proposed inkjet-printer approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present various novel techniques for the performance
   enhancement of nanotechnology-enabled wireless platforms utilizing
   inkjet-printed carbon-based thin films, especially for gas sensing
   applications. The key advancements include surface modification
   techniques to drastically reduce film thickness (from micron to nm) and
   a unique in-house developed nano-patterning process to increase porosity
   of the thin film resulting in increased surface contact area with gas.
   We have improved the performance by nearly one order of magnitude (a
   factor of around 10), increasing the sensitivity to 4.8\% at 60 ppm,
   compared to previously reported results (6\% sensitivity after exposure
   to 500 ppm NH3). We also propose a novel technique for carbon-based
   material growth on top of pre-printed patterns. The proposed
   graphene-based thin film approach could set the foundation for a
   plethora of novel wireless sensing and gas-reconfigurable communication
   platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has successfully built the object classifier for object
   detection. Most approaches operate with a pre-defined class and require
   a model to be trained in advance. In this paper, we present a system
   with a novel approach for multi-vehicle detection and tracking by using
   a monocular camera on a moving platform. This approach requires no
   camera-intrinsic parameters or camera-motion parameters, which enable
   the system to be successfully implemented without prior training. In our
   approach, bottom-up segmentation is applied on the input images to get
   the superpixels. The scene is parsed into less segmented regions by
   merging similar superpixels. Then, the parsing results are utilized to
   estimate the road region and detect vehicles on the road by using the
   properties of superpixels. Finally, tracking is achieved and fed back to
   further guide vehicle detection in future frames. Experimental results
   show that the method demonstrates significant vehicle detecting and
   tracking performance without further restrictions and performs
   effectively in complex environments.}},

Abstract = {{Practical implementations of secret-key generation are often based on
   sequential strategies, which handle reliability and secrecy in two
   successive steps, called reconciliation and privacy amplification. In
   this paper, we propose an alternative scheme based on polar coding that
   jointly deals with reliability and secrecy. We study a binary degraded
   symmetric discrete memoryless source model with uniform marginals, and
   assume one-way rate-limited public communication between two legitimate
   users. Specifically, we propose secret-key capacity-achieving polar
   coding schemes, in which users rely on pre-shared secret seed of
   negligible rate. For the model studied, we thus provide the first
   example of low-complexity secret-key capacity-achieving scheme that
   handles vector quantization, for rate-limited public communication.
   Furthermore, we provide examples for which no seed is required.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm for
   similarity computation to improve the recommendation accuracy of the
   neighborhood method, which is one of the most popular Collaborative
   Filtering (CF) recommendation algorithms. We formulate a probabilistic
   inference problem as to compute the marginal posterior distributions of
   similarity variables from their joint posterior distribution given the
   observed ratings. However, direct computation is prohibitive in
   large-scale recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce an appropriate
   chosen factor graph to express the factorization of the joint
   distribution function, and utilize the BP algorithm that operates in the
   factor graph to exploit the factorization for efficient inference. In
   addition, since the high degree at the factor node incurs an exponential
   increase in computational complexity, we also propose a
   complexity-reduction technique. The overall complexity of the proposed
   BP algorithm on a factor graph is linear in the number of variables,
   which ensures scalability. Finally, through experiments on the MovieLens
   dataset, we show the superior prediction accuracy of the proposed
   BP-based similarity computation algorithm for recommendation.}},

Abstract = {{Counterfeit devices are wreaking havoc in the industry today and are
   causing billions of dollars of loss in revenue to companies. These
   devices usually have fake components or have components that are
   re-marked as better ones. Illegitimate workshops even manufacture
   counterfeit devices on a large scale. Hence, counterfeit detection is of
   utmost importance. However, most counterfeit detection techniques today
   have complex and expensive setups that are slow in generating results.
   Some methods are also destructive to the device under test, and can
   hence only be applied to a small portion of the suspect devices. Most
   methods are also usually intended to target a specific set of devices.
   In this paper, we propose a simple and cheap technique of counterfeit
   detection, which we believe is a first-of-its-kind, network-based
   solution. Being network-based, it can be used to swiftly test a broad
   range of networked devices. The technique only monitors the network
   traffic of the device, therefore it is non-destructive. We first
   illustrate the general efficacy of the technique using FPGAs. Next, we
   show that lower-end processors (i.e., Core i3) in real systems can be
   differentiated from higher-end processors (i.e., Core i7) based on the
   host node's network traffic. This technique is effective against devices
   with counterfeit components or even with legitimate, but re-marked (as
   higher capacity) components. Using a neural network based classifier, we
   show classifier recall values (i.e., the ratio of the number of true
   positives to the sum of the number of true positives and false
   negatives) of up to 78.7\% using traffic captures of 2,500 packets.}},

Abstract = {{Nurses do not always have visual access to their patients in hospital
   corridors. During these times, lack of proper monitoring of auditory
   cues can potentially delay nurse response time and disable early
   detection of complications. Particular acoustic characteristics of
   hospital sound environments such as reverberation time can be highly
   detrimental to nurses' sound-based task performance. In previous
   studies, the effects of surface materials on temporal characteristics of
   reverberant corridor sound environments have been studied. However,
   little is known about the relationship between floor-plate shapes and
   temporal characteristics of reverberant corridor sound environments. The
   main goal of this study was to statistically examine the relationship
   between floor-plate shape and temporal characteristics of reverberant
   sound environments in inter-connected nursing unit corridors by
   conducting floor-plate shape analysis, acoustic simulation studies and
   field measurements. Overall, the findings suggest the potential
   effectiveness of acoustic simulation programs in predicting the temporal
   characteristics of reverberant sound environments in inter-connected
   hospital corridors. Based on the acoustic simulation analysis,
   reverberation time was significantly correlated with two floor-plate
   shape metrics: visual fragmentation and relative grid distance.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-locked loops are used to synthesize frequency sources for RF
   conversion and IO clocks for data synchronization, and serve as core
   building blocks for communication systems. Consequently, testing of PLL
   loop performance is critical for guaranteeing the reliability of the
   underlying communication systems. In this paper, a testing method based
   on loop triggering and use of low-cost built-in analog sensors (small
   number of transistors) to accurately predict phase-locked loop dynamic
   parameters is proposed. The sensors are designed in such a way that the
   sensor responses show strong statistical correlation with the PLL
   parameters being tested. Accordingly, supervised learners are

Abstract = {{In the recent past, there has been steady growth in the data transfer
   rate of modern digital serial communication systems. Consequently,
   accurate characterization of high-speed signal transmission lines is
   necessary for ensuring high signal integrity. Time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) has been widely used in prior research to characterize high speed
   interconnect. The accuracy of the characterization depends on the
   sampling rate and the slew rate of the TDR input excitation signal. At
   high speeds it is not always possible to deliver ``perfect{''}
   (impulse/step) TDR stimulus. In this paper, an algorithm is presented to
   compensate for the inherent distortion in non-ideal TDR stimulus to
   improve the accuracy of interconnect characterization. The algorithm is
   applied to the problem of microstrip transmission line characterization
   for identifying discontinuities in signal interconnect. Hardware
   measurements validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{Real world sounds are ubiquitous and form an important part of the
   edifice of our cognitive abilities. Their perception combines signatures
   from spectral and temporal domains, among others, yet traditionally
   their analysis is focused on the frame based spectral properties. We
   consider the problem of sound analysis from perceptual perspective and
   investigate the temporal properties of a ``footsteps{''} sound, which is
   a particularly challenging from the time-frequency analysis viewpoint.
   We identify the irregular repetition of the self similarity and the
   sense of duration as significant to its perceptual quality and extract
   features using the Teager-Kaiser energy operator. We build an acoustic
   event detection system for ``footsteps{''} which shows promising results

Abstract = {{Video delivery over wireless and cellular networks can be severely
   impaired due to bandwidth limitations and also due to the presence of
   burst losses and signal-loss intervals. This paper proposes unequal
   protection of Region of interest (ROT) encoded videos for transmission
   over low-bitrate and error-prone channels. Here, a flexible and
   interactive ROT is introduced in a low-complexity, and
   standard-compliant fashion to encode the critical regions within each
   frame at a higher quality as compared to the background. Further, the
   reconstruction fidelity of the high-quality ROT is improved by unequally
   protecting the ROT using an error-resilient video delivery scheme known
   as Multiple Representation Coding (MRC). Simulation results indicate
   that the proposed strategy can facilitate a graceful recovery of the ROT

Abstract = {{Sensor array measurements can be inverted to image a region containing
   targets. The resulting amplitude image is usually interpreted as target
   strength versus location, but often the imaged amplitude is a function
   of more parameters than just the location. Sparse target regions can be
   imaged with dictionary based modeling which relies on enumeration of
   each parameter with a dense grid. With many parameters, the dictionary
   becomes too large, which leads to computational complexity issues. This
   paper shows how additional parameters, such as target orientation and
   symmetry, can be represented by a tensor matrix instead of a simple
   amplitude. Furthermore, the tensor can be treated as a continuous
   variable just like amplitude, which enables extraction of multiple
   parameters, while reducing the storage requirements of the dictionary,
   and reducing off-grid modeling error.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) systems can provide illumination and
   communication simultaneously via light emitting diodes (LEDs).
   Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms transmitted
   in a VLC system will have high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs).
   Since the transmitting LED is dynamic-range limited, peaks of the OFDM
   waveform can be clipped causing signal degradation. This same phenomenon
   also occurs in RF communication system, although in RF systems it is
   straightforward to quantify the performance in terms of RF power
   conversion efficiency. Results on quantifying VLC performance are
   scarce. Specifically, because VLC differs from RF communication in
   system constraint, baseband signal format, and nonlinearity
   characteristic of the transmitter, it is not obvious how PAPR is related
   to illumination-to-communication conversion efficiency in VLC. In this
   paper, we will attempt to quantify the illumination-to-communication
   conversion efficiency and clarify how PAPR is related to efficiency in
   VLC systems. We also present a method to improve the efficiency of VLC
   OFDM systems.}},

   auto-correlation function (or more generally, the cross-correlation
   function) of ergodic stationary signals, an important task in a variety
   of applications. This estimator sparsely and non-adaptively samples the
   process via Bernoulli selection, generalizing the classical estimator in
   a natural way, and offering significant sampling reductions while
   sacrificing a modest degree of accuracy. Both the mean and variance of
   our estimator are explicitly analyzed, and in particular, we show that
   POUTINE gives an unbiased estimate of the classical estimator, which in
   turn gives an unbiased estimate of the underlying second-order
   statistics of interest. Furthermore, we show that POUTINE is a
   consistent estimator with variance approaching zero asymptotically. We

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of undersampled time-varying signals improves as
   stronger signal models provide more information to aid the estimator. In
   class Kalman filter-type algorithms, dynamic models of signal evolution
   are highly leveraged but there is little exploitation of structure
   within a signal at a given time. In contrast, standard sparse
   approximation schemes (e.g., L1 minimization) utilize strong structural
   models for a single signal, but do not admit obvious ways to incorporate
   dynamic models for data streams. In this work we introduce a causal
   estimation algorithm to estimate time-varying sparse signals. This
   algorithm is based on a hierarchical probabilistic model that uses
   re-weighted L1 minimization as its core computation, and propagates
   second order statistics through time similar to classic Kalman
   filtering. The resulting algorithm achieves very good performance, and
   appears to be particularly robust to errors in the dynamic signal model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel acoustic modeling framework,
   synchronous HMM, which takes full advantage of the capacity of the
   heterogeneous data sources and achieves an optimal balance between
   modeling accuracy and robustness. The synchronous HMM introduces an
   additional layer of substates between the HMM states and the Gaussian
   component variables. The substates have the capability to register
   long-span non-phonetic attributes, which are integrally called speech
   scenes in this study. The hierarchical modeling scheme allows an
   accurate description of probability distribution of speech units in
   different speech scenes. To address the data sparsity problem, a
   decision-based clustering algorithm is presented to determine the set of
   speech scenes and to tie the substate parameters. Moreover, we propose
   the multiplex Viterbi algorithm to efficiently decode the synchronous
   HMMs within a search space of the same size as for the standard HMMs.
   The experiments on the Aurora 2 task show that the synchronous HMMs
   produce a significant improvement in recognition performance over the
   HMM baseline at the expense of a moderate increase in the memory
   requirement and computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a generalized maximum a posteriori spectral
   amplitude (GMAPA) algorithm to spectral restoration for speech
   enhancement. The proposed GMAPA algorithm dynamically adjusts the scale
   of prior information to calculate the gain function for spectral
   restoration. In higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, GMAPA
   adopts a smaller scale to prevent over-compensations that may result in
   speech distortions. On the other hand, in lower SNR conditions, GMAPA
   uses a larger scale to enable the gain function to more effectively
   remove noise components from noisy speech. We also develop a mapping
   function to optimally determine the prior information scale according to
   the SNR of speech utterances. Two standardized speech databases,
   Aurora-4 and Aurora-2, are used to conduct objective and recognition
   evaluations, respectively, to test the proposed GMAPA algorithm. For
   comparison, three conventional spectral restoration algorithms are also
   evaluated; they are minimum mean-square error spectral estimator (MMSE),
   maximum likelihood spectral amplitude estimator (MLSA), and maximum a
   posteriori spectral amplitude estimator (MAPA). The experimental results
   first confirm that GMAPA provides better objective evaluation scores
   than MMSE, MLSA, and MAPA in lower SNR conditions, with comparable
   scores to MLSA in higher SNR conditions. Moreover, our recognition
   results indicate that GMAPA outperforms the three conventional
   algorithms consistently over different testing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience of power distribution is pertinent to the energy grid under
   severe weather. This work develops an analytical formulation for
   large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution induced by severe
   weather. A focus is on incorporating pertinent characteristics of
   topological network structures into spatial temporal modeling. Such
   characteristics are new notations as dynamic failure-and
   recovery-neighborhoods. The neighborhoods quantify correlated failures
   and recoveries due to topology and types of components in power
   distribution. The resulting model is a multi-scale non-stationary
   spatial temporal random process. Dynamic resilience is then defined
   based on the model. Using the model and large-scale real data from
   Hurricane Ike, unique characteristics are identified: The failures
   follow the 80/ 20 rule where 74.3\% of the total failures result from
   20.7\% of failure neighborhoods with up to 72 components ``failed{''}
   together. Thus the hurricane caused a large number of correlated
   failures. Unlike the failures, the recoveries follow 60/90 rule: 59.3\%
   of recoveries resulted from 92.7\% of all neighborhoods where either one
   component alone or two together recovered. Thus about 60\% recoveries
   were uncorrelated and required individual restorations. The failure and
   recovery processes are further studied through the resilience metric to
   identify the least resilient regions and time durations.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Number = {{2338}},
Pages = {{11-19}},
Abstract = {{Since 2007, the transit industry has benefited from a widely adopted
   data standard called the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS),
   which has enabled the development of numerous traveler information tools
   (i.e., transit trip planners). The purpose of this project is to
   demonstrate the potential for GTFS feeds as a data source for transit
   analyses, such as those found in the Transit Capacity and Quality of
   Service Manua There are three primary project tasks: an analysis of GTFS
   field usage by different agencies; an analysis of a single agency's
   operations at the stop, route, and system levels; and a batch analysis
   and comparison of 50 large transit agencies in North America. Compared
   with manually transcribing schedules from transit websites or parsing
   printed schedules, the use of scripts and database queries suggests that
   the GTFS is a highly efficient data source and proves the importance of
   broadly accepted data standards. The methodology documented in this
   paper and the open source scripts (made available online) will be useful
   for any analyst or researcher who has tasks related to the analysis of
   single or multiple transit systems at the stop, route, or system level.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has produced mixed results for a hypothesis that
   drivers reduce speeds to conserve gasoline when gasoline prices are
   high. An analysis that builds on 2012 research by Hendrik Wolff is
   replicated with an hourly data set of highway speeds from Washington
   State. A decline in speeds due to increasing gasoline prices is modest
   but statistically significant. Specifically, a \$1/gallon increase in
   gas prices reduces the average speed by 0.27 mph and changes the average
   highway speed from 70.82 to 70.55 mph. The change could translate to
   substantial gas expenditure savings on the order of \$1 billion annually
   if similar reductions were seen on all U.S. highways. Study results
   indicate that in terms of heterogeneity, the fastest drivers do not
   reduce speeds proportionately; such behavior could undermine the safety
   objective of a gasoline tax. The speed changes are caused mainly by the
   gasoline price that drivers pay at the pump. The intense public media
   attention given to gas prices has relatively little effect on speeding
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Light absorbing organic carbon, often called brown carbon, has the
   potential to significantly contribute to the visible light-absorption
   budget, particularly at shorter wavelengths. Currently, the relative
   contributions of particulate brown carbon to light absorption, as well
   as the sources of brown carbon, are poorly understood. With this in mind
   size-resolved direct measurements of brown carbon were made at both
   urban (Atlanta), and rural (Yorkville) sites in Georgia. Measurements in
   Atlanta were made at both a representative urban site and a road-side
   site adjacent to a main highway. Fine particle absorption was measured
   with a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP) and seven-wavelength
   Aethalometer, and brown carbon absorption was estimated based on Mie
   calculations using direct size-resolved measurements of chromophores in
   solvents. Size-resolved samples were collected using a cascade impactor
   and analyzed for water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), organic and
   elemental carbon (OC and EC), and solution light-absorption spectra of
   water and methanol extracts. Methanol extracts were more light-absorbing
   than water extracts for all size ranges and wavelengths. Absorption
   refractive indices of the organic extracts were calculated from solution
   measurements for a range of wavelengths and used with Mie theory to
   predict the light absorption by fine particles comprised of these
   components, under the assumption that brown carbon and other aerosol
   components were externally mixed. For all three sites, chromophores were
   predominately in the accumulation mode with an aerodynamic mean diameter
   of 0.5 mu m, an optically effective size range resulting in predicted
   particle light absorption being a factor of 2 higher than bulk solution
   absorption. Mie-predicted brown carbon absorption at 350 nm contributed
   a significant fraction (20 to 40 \%) relative to total light absorption,
   with the highest contributions at the rural site where organic to
   elemental carbon ratios were highest. Brown carbon absorption, however,
   was highest by the roadside site due to vehicle emissions. The direct
   size-resolved measurement of brown carbon in solution definitively shows
   that it is present and optically important in the near-UV range in both
   a rural and urban environment during the summer when biomass burning
   emissions are low. These results allow estimates of brown carbon aerosol
   absorption from direct measurements of chromophores in aerosol extracts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to assist visually impaired persons to
   locate magnetic objects along a path when performing daily arm-reaching
   and way-finding tasks. To avoid the effect of geo-magnetics, gradient of
   an object from measured magnetic flux densities has been developed,
   which characterize the two properties; the relative location and
   magnetic moment vectors of a magnetic object in the presence of
   geomagnetic fields. Based on the object motion relative to the sensor
   along a path, this method overcomes the difficulty of measuring the
   magnetic anomalies directly. Using dipole models, the magnetic moment
   and position vectors of the object are measured by a multi-sensor
   system; and these properties along a path graphically are represented by
   a magnetic tensor based ellipsoids. The effectiveness and accuracy of
   the magnetic field localization has been numerically demonstrated and
   validated by comparing results against exact solutions. For one object
   condition, the location and moment can be calculated accurately. Results
   also show that the tensor based ellipsoids are path dependent and can be
   used to identify the presence of a second object.}},

Abstract = {{A computer program designed specifically to track smoke movement during
   a fire was applied to the task of designing an integrated smoke
   management scheme for high-rise buildings. The goal of the program was
   to design a smoke control plan that manipulates the pressure
   distribution throughout the building while keeping smoke away from
   building occupants. The results of the program indicate that a plan to
   pressurize both the stairwells and floor spaces within the building and
   to utilize the elevator shafts as a route to vent smoke to the exterior
   can be employed to maintain smoke-free areas on the floors as well as in
   the fire escape stairs. Combining stair and floor pressurization has
   several advantages, including reducing the size and capacity of the
   pressurization equipment necessary to keep smoke at bay. The combination
   of pressurized areas also reduces the force necessary to open fire
   escape doors and keeps the force within code limitations. The final
   aspect of the smoke management scheme involves equipping the elevator
   shafts with exhaust fans to reduce the flow resistance of smoke that is
   transported to the exterior of the building. The combination of
   pressurized stairwells and floors, coupled with elevator exhaust, forms
   a three-pronged approach to smoke management that has the best
   opportunity to improve life safety during a fire. The program results
   are used to determine the capacity of the pressurization equipment
   sufficient to maintain smoke-free conditions in the high-rise building.
   The dedicated fans employed in the stairwells that are capable of
   preventing smoke from invading the fire escapes are reasonably sized.
   Floor pressurization equipment is shown to be within the capabilities of
   existing comfort control equipment. The computer-predicted capacity of
   the stairwell air-handling units (AHUs) compare well with the size of
   equipment that has been used in several experimental stairwell
   pressurization tests.}},

Abstract = {{Computer modeling of structural fires can play a significant role in
   simulating the development of a fire and the subsequent movement of
   smoke throughout the building. Computer programs have evolved to such an
   extent that they are able to predict where smoke will travel and to what
   extent it will contaminate various areas throughout the building such as
   fire escape stairwells and elevator shafts. Therefore, they can be
   employed to suggest modifications in the building construction,
   employment of building HVAC equipment, and use of pressurization fans in
   order to formulate a building life-safety plan that has a reasonable
   chance of reducing injuries due to smoke inhalation. In this work, the
   results provided by two computer programs that are capable of simulating
   smoke movement during building fires are compared for a simulated fire
   in a high-rise structure. Major differences in the formulation of the
   two programs are identified, and the differences in the predicted smoke
   movement results are explained. The temperature distribution throughout
   the building is shown to be a major factor in moving smoke within the
   building. Overall, there is reasonable comparison between the two
   computer predictions; however, large errors can result if the models
   employ unrealistic temperature distributions throughout the building
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional photovoltaic (PV) systems are delivered and installed in
   relatively small, 1 m by 1.5 m, aluminum-framed modules. These modules
   are typically composed of 60 cells of mono- or poly-crystalline silicon,
   laminated with tempered glass and polymer layers to encapsulate and
   protect the cells. This paper reports on a project to increase the size
   of the PV module by integrating multiple PV laminates within a composite
   frame, eliminating the aluminum framing system. The composite frame is
   non-conductive, eliminating the electrical bonding and grounding
   requirements for the system. The paper discusses the design, analysis,
   construction, and testing of a first generation prototype, known as a
   mega-module, constructed with a structure of pultruded composites. This
   mega-module consists of three 250 watt custom laminates, without
   aluminum frames, and features an integrated electrical bus structure
   within the pultruded longitudinal structure. The investigation consists
   of electrical and structural testing per Underwriters Laboratories
   Standards 1703 and 2703 along with structural analysis to establish
   stresses and deflections of the structure during lifting and assembly.
   The paper focuses on the design of small-scale connections using
   pultruded composites, and analysis to assess the structural stiffness
   required to protect the electrical components of the mega-module from
   damage during installation - including the effects of impact loading.}},

Abstract = {{Difference usually occurs between predictions of a finite element (FE)
   model and experimental measurements from the actual structure. To
   achieve more accurate predictions, FE models can be updated based on
   field measurement data. In the past few decades, numerous FE model
   updating methods have been developed. Nevertheless, when applied to a
   large structure, most methods are computationally challenging and
   expensive, because these methods operate on a complex model for the
   entire structure. To address this issue, a substructure-based updating
   method is presented in this paper. The Craig-Bampton theory is adopted
   to condense the entire structural model into a substructure (currently
   being analyzed) and a residual structure. Dynamic response of the
   residual structure is approximated using only a limited number of
   dominant mode shapes. A modal dynamic residual approach is adopted for
   updating the substructure model. This substructure model updating
   procedure (through modal dynamic residual approach) is validated by
   numerical simulation with a 200 degrees-of-freedom spring-mass model.
   The performance is compared with an updating procedure based on a
   conventional modal property difference approach.}},

Abstract = {{This research studies multi-physics simulation of a slotted patch
   antenna sensor. In our previous work, a folded patch antenna was
   designed for passive wireless strain and crack sensing. When
   experiencing deformation, the antenna shape changes, causing shift in
   electromagnetic resonance frequency of the antenna. The wireless
   interrogation system utilizes the principle of electromagnetic
   backscattering and adopts off-the-shelf 900MHz radiofrequency
   identification (RFID) technology. In this research, a slotted patch
   antenna sensor is designed, while maintaining antenna resonance
   frequency to be around 900MHz. The slotted antenna detours surface
   current using slotted patterns, so that the electrical length is kept
   similar as previous folded patch antenna sensor yet sensor footprint is
   reduced.
   To accurately describe both mechanical and electromagnetic behaviors of
   the antenna sensor, a multi-physics coupled simulation approach is
   pursued. A multi-physics finite element model uses the same geometry and
   meshing for both mechanical and electromagnetic simulations. Because
   electromagnetism has little influence on the mechanical behavior of the
   sensor, displacement field and electrical field can be solved separately
   using segregated steps. Known as sequential coupling, the solution
   method involves two or more analyses, each solving for a different
   physical field. The mechanics-electromagnetics coupled simulation is
   implemented using a commercial software package, COMSOL. Strain sensing
   performance predicted by the multi-physics simulation is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how guided waves are expected to scatter from typical
   defects is useful for detection, localization, and characterization of
   damage. Structural health monitoring using sparse guided wave transducer
   arrays has been frequently proposed, but scattering information is
   rarely incorporated as part of the analysis methodology. If scattering
   characteristics are represented as a matrix indexed by incident angle
   and scattered angle, sparse array measurements essentially sample this
   matrix. Prior work by the authors has demonstrated a methodology for
   estimating the entire scattering matrix from these sampled angles. Here
   we improve this methodology and apply it to the generic defect geometry
   of a crack growing from a fastener hole, where a notch is used to
   simulate a crack. First, a controlled experiment is performed to obtain
   guided wave data for estimating scattering matrices for notches of
   different lengths. Second, a similar notch is introduced in a different
   specimen that is geometrically more complex and thus closer to being
   representative of an actual part. The scattered signals from the second
   specimen are computed and then analyzed via both delay-and-sum imaging
   and minimum variance imaging, utilizing the previously estimated
   scattering characteristics for damage detection, localization, and
   characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Bridge collapses were reported worldwide. More than a quarter of the
   bridges in the United States are obsolete and deficient. The evaluation
   and maintenance of concrete bridge decks has drawn significant
   attentions from the government and its people over the past decades. A
   non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique, ground penetrating radar, is
   preferred for its high speed, which causes minimal traffic interruption.
   The evaluation is generally based on rebar reflections. The reflections
   from the first rebar layer are usually strong enough to evaluate either
   the concrete material above this layer or the rebar corrosion condition.
   However, in most cases, only one third of the deck can be evaluated this
   way. Deeper rebar reflections are usually too weak to be detected
   because of the high attenuation through long distance and the masking
   effect of the first layer. Further processing is needed to extract the
   information from the second rebar layer. In this paper, a migration,
   image enhancement, and demigration process is proposed. The main idea of
   the proposed approach is to enhance the rebar reflection intensity by
   increasing the signal to noise ratio without significantly distorting
   the radargram. Its effectiveness is validated by the simulation study
   discussed in this paper.}},

Title = {{The role of risk aversion in nuclear plant safety decisions}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{28-36}},
Abstract = {{Risk to civil infrastructure facilities from extreme natural and manmade
   hazards is characterized by involuntary exposure and potentially severe
   consequences to the public. Individuals and the public tend to overstate
   involuntary risks that are poorly understood or involve the possibility
   of fatalities. Such exaggerations of risk perception influence
   policy-making and the development of appropriate strategies for
   mitigating and managing the risk. Regulatory decision-making for nuclear
   power plant safety represents a case that is affected by exaggerated
   risk perception caused by fear. The recent meltdowns at the Fukushima
   Daiichi Plant in Northeast Japan in March 2011 reinforced such fears and
   fueled opposition to the further development of nuclear power as a
   solution to the nation's growing energy demands. In this paper, we
   analyze the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)'s regulations
   regarding to the operation of nuclear power plants utilizing a decision
   model known as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which permits
   risk-averse behavior to be modeled in assessing both likelihoods and
   consequences of a hazardous event. The investigation is extended to
   different requirements that are influenced by the International
   Commission on Radiological Protection for an international perspective.
   Finally, we consider how risk attitudes can be incorporated in future
   decisions with an example of retrofitting Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in
   accordance with the Severe Accident Mitigation Alternatives stipulated
   by the USNRC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of oxalate during oxygen delignification causes a number
   of operational problems in pulp and paper mills. In this work, the
   oxygen delignification of wheat straw pulp was carried out under various
   conditions and the concentration of resulting oxalate in the effluent
   was determined. The experimental results show that the amount of oxalate
   in the effluent was closely related to the reaction conditions,
   specifically reaction temperature, oxygen pressure, and alkali charge.
   Raising reaction temperature and/or oxygen pressure could promoted
   oxalate formation. The oxalate concentration increased linearly with the
   consumption of alkali but logarithmically with reduction of kappa
   number. An empirical model for describing the oxalate formation in the
   oxygen delignification of wheat straw pulp was generated with a
   reasonably high correlation coefficient (R-2=0.909), which can provide
   useful guidance for control of oxalate formation during oxygen

Abstract = {{Developing a method that quantitatively evaluates and compares the

   of the highways constructed with different designs, different
   construction practices, in different places with different environments,
   and under different traffic conditions with different Maintenance and
   Rehabilitation (M\&R) histories, has been challenging. The factors
   (costs, effectiveness and traffic volume) are studied in this paper and
   then an economic and user service-based performance measure method is
   proposed to identify high or low pavement overall performance. The two
   indicators, Equivalent Comprehensive Cost (ECC) and an Average Service
   Level (ASL), in this method are proposed to evaluate the unit agency
   costs and average service level over the analysis period of the project
   quantitatively. Two different pavement projects were generated with
   hypothetical data to illustrate the ability of the proposed method to
   compare the overall performance of different projects, and a sensitivity
   analysis of the discount rate was also studied and discussed. Future
   research is recommended.}},

Title = {{Variational Image Denoising Based on Autocorrelation Whiteness}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1931-1955}},
Abstract = {{Variational and PDE-based methods have been widely used over the past
   two decades for edge-preserving denoising of images. However, in
   general, these methods fail to preserve textural and other fine scale
   features but typically remove them in a similar manner as noise. We
   propose a strategy which fully exploits the prior information available
   when the noise is known to be white in order to better preserve fine
   scale features during the denoising process. In particular, based on the
   assumption that noise is additive and white, we propose a novel fidelity
   functional to be used in a variational framework in order to enforce
   whiteness of the residue image. Unlike the classical total variation L-2
   functional, whose variational analysis yields local differential terms
   in the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation, our whiteness term exhibits a
   global first variation, thus transforming the classical Euler-Lagrange
   PDE into an integro-differential equation which is most conveniently
   solved using gradient descent techniques. Numerical results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed strategy.}},

Pages = {{2075-2108}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new shape-based image reconstruction technique
   applicable to a large class of imaging problems formulated in a
   variational sense. Given a collection of shape priors (a shape
   dictionary), we define our problem as choosing the right elements and
   geometrically composing them through basic set operations to
   characterize desired regions in the image. This combinatorial problem
   can be relaxed and then solved using classical descent methods. The main
   component of this relaxation is forming certain compactly supported
   functions which we call ``knolls{''} and reformulating the shape
   representation as a basis expansion in terms of such functions. To
   select suitable elements of the dictionary, our problem ultimately
   reduces to solving a nonlinear program with sparsity constraints. We
   provide a new sparse nonlinear reconstruction technique to approach this
   problem. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated with
   some standard imaging problems including image segmentation, X-ray
   tomography, and diffusive tomography.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a piezoelectric transducer that is attached to the back of a
   plate-like structure, such as is the case for guided wave structural
   health monitoring. This transducer may be excited to produce guided
   waves that propagate outward from the source through the structure.
   These waves interact with impedance discontinuities in the structure at
   defects, bond lines, plate boundaries, and other geometrical features.
   These propagating waves may be measured on the surface of the specimen
   using either a scanning laser vibrometer or a scanning air coupled
   transducer. When full wavefield data are obtained by recording complete
   waveforms on a spatial grid, these measurements contain a wealth of
   information that can be used for identification, localization and
   characterization of damage. Results are presented here from a study that
   uses full acoustic wavefield images of propagating guided waves to
   detect and size different defect types in aluminum plate specimens.
   Several detection and sizing algorithms have previously been considered,
   including frequency domain analysis, incident wave removal, and acoustic
   wave crest analysis. The acoustic wave crest analysis method, which was
   developed by the authors to study corrosion type defects in aluminum
   plates, is applied here to analyze wavefield interactions with fatigue
   cracks in an aluminum plate specimen. The methodology demonstrated here
   on aluminum plate specimens is appropriate for application to critical
   metallic structural components as part of an integrated health
   management system.}},

Abstract = {{Testing of radio frequency (RF) components such as mixers, amplifiers
   and voltage controlled oscillators (VCO) traditionally relies on the
   ability to accurately estimate the device characteristics using down
   conversion or undersampling based test setups. Efficient and accurate
   acquisition of the modulating signal either requires a phase locked
   local oscillator signal or is limited in accuracy. This makes the setup
   more complicated and hence costly. In this paper a novel low cost test
   setup, independent of the requirement of any phase synchronous local
   carrier, is proposed. The technique relies on the capability of
   estimating the carrier phase and frequency with a high accuracy through
   simple back end algorithm. The envelope and carrier waveforms of the DUT
   (10GHz mixer followed by buffer amplifiers) are reconstructed through
   back-end signal processing from samples acquired directly at the
   component output using incoherent undersampling. From the reconstructed
   test response critical performance parameters (AM-AM and AM-PM) of the
   DUT are computed.}},

Abstract = {{Electroless copper deposition was investigated on epoxy laminate
   substrates (Isola 185HR) using a silver-based catalyst, and a
   non-roughening surface treatment method based on sulfuric acid. The
   current challenges in electroless copper deposition include (i) high
   cost of Pd-based catalysts, (ii) deterioration of electrical performance
   of deposited metal at high frequency due to electron scattering at the
   roughened surface, and (iii) limited adhesion strength of electroless
   layers to substrates. We investigated an electroless copper deposition
   procedure composed of a H2SO4 surface pretreatment, two-step Sn/Ag
   nano-colloidal catalyst seeding, and immersion in a traditional
   formaldehyde-containing electroless copper bath. The H2SO4 pretreatment
   activated the epoxy surface for electroless deposition. Other strong
   acids did not lead to deposition. The H2SO4 treatment cleaned the
   substrate and provided the adhesion of the catalyst and electroless
   copper without increasing the surface roughness. XPS results showed a
   decrease in the carbonyl groups (C=O), and acid/ester functionalities
   (O-C=O) at the surface. Adsorbed sulfate on the substrate from the H2SO4
   treatment led to Sn(II) sensitization. The tin-silver activation step
   resulted in Sn(IV) and Ag(0) products in the form of a Sn/Ag
   nano-colloidal catalyst. The Sn/Ag colloid acted as a catalyst for
   electroless copper deposition on the epoxy laminate substrates. (C) 2013

Title = {{Mobile Cross-Slope Measurement Method Using Lidar Technology}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2367}},
Pages = {{53-59}},
Abstract = {{An effective cross slope facilitates drainage on highways and prevents
   hydroplaning. There is a need for transportation agencies to identify
   and measure road sections that have noneffective cross slopes so that
   timely corrective maintenance can be performed. However, the traditional
   manual methods used by transportation agencies to measure cross slopes
   with a digital level are time-consuming and labor intensive; these
   methods are not feasible for conducting a network-level cross-slope
   measurement. A proposed mobile cross-slope measurement method uses
   emerging mobile lidar technology that can accurately and effectively
   conduct network-level cross-slope measurement at highway speeds. The
   proposed mobile cross-slope measurement method uses emerging lidar
   technology (lidar calibration, data acquisition, region of interest
   extraction, and cross-slope computation). A sensitivity study was
   conducted to determine the key parameter (i.e., the region of interest
   interval) for the proposed method. The accuracy and the repeatability of
   the proposed method were critically validated through testing in a
   controlled environment. A case study demonstrated the capability of the
   proposed method. The results from the controlled test show that the
   proposed method can achieve desirable accuracy with an average
   measurement difference of 0.08 degrees from the digital-level
   measurements and a desirable level of repeatability with a standard
   deviation of less than 0.03 degrees in three runs. The results of the
   case study show that the proposed method can be operated at highway
   speed and is promising for the assessment of network-level cross-slope
   adequacy.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed detection applications for a fusion center that
   has a limited time to collect, weight and fuse local decisions to
   produce a global decision in a wireless sensor network that uses a
   random access protocol. When this time is not long enough to collect
   decisions from all nodes in the network, a strategy is needed for
   collecting those with the highest reliability. This is accomplished by
   incorporating a reliability-based splitting algorithm into the random
   access protocol: the collection time is divided into frames and only
   nodes with a specified range of reliabilities compete for the channel
   within each frame. Nodes with the most reliable decisions attempt
   transmission in the first frame; nodes with the next most reliable set
   of decisions attempt in the next frame; etc. To ensure that the results
   we derive are lower bounds on the detection performance that would be
   seen in practice, the local decisions that arrive within a frame are
   assigned the smallest reliability in the range associated with that
   frame. Two performance measures are used: Detection Error Probability
   (DEP) and Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE) of the proposed scheme
   relative to a TDMA-based scheme. We then show how to minimize the DEP by
   determining the reliability intervals that define which nodes attempt to
   transmit in each frame. Intervals that maximize the channel throughput
   will often, but not always, minimize the DEP of the proposed scheme.
   Necessary conditions for the optimality of the maximum throughput
   intervals are thus derived. Numerical results indicate that these
   conditions are often sufficient when the observation noise is Gaussian.
   From the ARE, we determine when the proposed scheme asymptotically
   outperforms a TDMA-based scheme.}},

Journal = {{ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{12, SI}},
Pages = {{1079-1101}},
Abstract = {{High-fidelity numerical simulations have been performed to study the
   formation and fragmentation of liquid sheets formed by two impinging
   jets using an improved volume-of-fluid (VOF) method augmented with
   several adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques. An efficient
   topology-oriented strategy was further established to optimize the
   performance and accuracy of the AMR algorithm. Two benchmark cases
   pertaining to low- and high-velocity impinging jets are simulated as
   part of a grid refinement study. Calculated jet dynamics show excellent
   agreement with experimental observations in terms of the rim shape,
   droplet size distribution and impact wave structures. Detailed flow
   physics associated with the temporal evolution and spatial development
   of the jets are explored over a wide range of Reynolds and Weber
   numbers. A realistic rendering post-processing using a ray-tracing
   technique is performed to obtain direct insight to the flow evolution.
   Special attention is paid to the dynamics of the impact wave which
   dominates the atomization of the injected liquid. The work appears to be
   the first systematic numerical study in which all the flow patterns
   formed by impingement of two liquid jets are obtained. Fine structures
   are captured based on their characteristic length scales. Various
   atomization modes, from stable to highly unstable, are resolved with
   high fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{The in-situ Vs profile in soils usually increases with depth due to its
   stress-dependent behavior. For instance, Lew and Campbell (1985)
   observed that Vs increases as a power law with depth for various
   Quaternary age soils. More recent studies by Andrus et al. (2003, 2007)
   also showed a similar trend. On the other hand, the representative Vs
   profile at the Savannah River Site (SRS) located in western South
   Carolina next to Georgia shows an opposite trend. It has been known the
   SRS has complex geological conditions which consist of very old Miocene
   and Eocene sediments, primarily layered deposits of sands, clayey sands,
   silty sands, and inter-bedded clays which exhibit an apparent and
   unusual stress history profile. This paper attempts to examine the
   expected reasons with respect to these anomalous in-situ Vs trends at
   the SRS, including ageing, desiccation, overconsolidation, cementation,
   diagenesis, and other factors.}},

Abstract = {{Induction machines are widely used in industrial facilities as motors
   and increasingly in distributed generation, particularly in wind
   turbines. The short-circuit current contributed by induction machines in
   the first cycle following a fault outside the machine can be
   significant, and common practices for calculating these currents are
   well established. However, experimental short-circuit tests described in
   this paper indicate that conventional steady-state tests used to
   determine the induction machine parameters do not accurately
   characterize the short-circuit behavior of the induction machine. Test
   results for both balanced and unbalanced short-circuit faults applied to
   a 6.8 kVA, 230 V wound-rotor induction machine are described in this
   paper, and compared with transient simulations run in PSCAD and
   short-circuit calculations using conventional techniques. The results
   indicate that for faults at the machine terminals, leakage flux
   saturation causes a significantly higher short-circuit current magnitude
   from the induction machine than would otherwise be expected using a
   linear model obtained from steady-state tests.}},

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet
   anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are susceptible to poisoning by
   ppm-level sulfur contaminants (e. g., hydrogen sulfide, H2S) typically
   found in most hydrocarbon fuels, leading to severe performance loss or
   even cell failure. This problem calls for the development of new
   sulfur-tolerant anode materials for SOFC with high electrochemical
   activity. In light of such a research need and the ``trial-and-error{''}
   nature of many previous studies in this area, this paper describes an
   effective approach to rational design of sulfur-tolerant anode materials
   for SOFC. First, our selection of potential sulfur-tolerant anode
   materials is guided by the insights about the sulfur poisoning mechanism
   of conventional Ni-YSZ cermet anodes. Further, thermochemical analysis
   and properly-designed experiments are used as a powerful tool to quickly
   screen and narrow down on candidates that are worth further

Abstract = {{N-nitrosamines are emerging carcinogenic contaminants and can be
   generated from transformation of amines. Activated carbon (AC) materials
   with micro- and nano-porous structures are commonly used for extraction
   of nitrosamines in water, and for removal of micropollutants in water
   and wastewater treatment. Recent research demonstrated that AC materials
   may catalyze transformation of amine precursors to yield nitrosamines
   under environmentally relevant conditions. AC catalyzes the formation of
   nitrosamine primarily via two different types of reactions: (I)
   catalyzing nitrosation of amine with nitrite or nitrate to yield
   nitrosamine, and (II) catalyzing oxidation of amine in the presence of
   molecular oxygen and nitrogen to generate nitrosamine. The AC-catalyzed
   nitrosamine formation is highly influenced by AC's properties, amine
   precursors' structures and reaction conditions. Considering the
   widespread usage of AC in environmental and industrial applications, a
   better understanding of the catalytic impact of AC on nitrosamine
   formation is critical to minimize undesirable nitrosamine formation
   where co-existence of AC and amine precursors is encountered.}},

Abstract = {{Hormones, particularly estrogen, are known to play a role in the
   development of osteoarthritis (OA). In relation to this, the impact of
   pregnancy on OA remains unknown. Pregnancy leads to decreased
   expressions of both synthetic and degradation genes of articular
   chondrocytes, as determined using in vitro tests, but no in vivo studies
   have been performed exploring pregnancy and OA simultaneously. The
   present study investigates the effect of pregnancy on the progression of
   OA in the rat joint degeneration model using an intra-articular
   injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Twenty Wistar rats were
   divided into four groups: A-Pregnancy and intra-articular injection of
   MIA; B-MIA injection in naive rats; C-Pregnancy, and D-Sham injection of
   saline in naive rats. Articular cartilage was evaluated 18 days after
   the detection of vaginal plug in female rats using Janusz's macroscopic
   score, equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent via
   microcomputed tomography, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification.
   Results show that there was no significant difference in GAG content,
   attenuation, volume, and thickness of articular cartilage between
   pregnant and non-pregnant groups. Contrary to our initial hypothesis,
   pregnancy does not have observable effects on MIA-induced OA in rats at
   3 weeks.}},

   proposed framework unifies system thermodynamic concepts with feedback
   dissipativity and control theory to provide a thermodynamic-based
   semistabilization framework for feedback control design. Specifically,
   we consider feedback passive and dissipative systems since these systems
   are not only widespread in systems and control, but also have clear
   connections to thermodynamics. In addition, we define the notion of
   entropy for a nonlinear feedback dissipative dynamical system. Then, we
   develop a state feedback control design framework that minimizes the
   time-averaged system entropy and show that, under certain conditions,
   this controller also minimizes the time-averaged system energy. The main
   result is cast as an optimal control problem characterized by an
   optimization problem involving two linear matrix inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine a randomly deployed sensor network and propose
   a probabilistic sleep-scheduling scheme to conserve energy while
   maintaining a desired level of coverage by using coordination among
   sensors. To introduce coordination among neighboring sensors, we use a
   hard-core point process from stochastic geometry, which is an inhibition
   process and does not allow more than one sensor to be on in a given
   circular region. As compared to existing schemes, the hard-core point
   process allows coordination between sensors with little communication
   overhead. We analyze the proposed scheme and derive an expression for
   the event detection probability. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations
   and compare the event detection probability to a random switching scheme
   for a Poisson process of same intensity in order to confirm that the
   proposed scheme improves the detection probability.}},

Abstract = {{A concurrent learning adaptive control architecture for uncertain linear
   switched dynamical systems is presented. Like other concurrent learning
   adaptive control architectures, the adaptive weight update law uses both
   recorded and current data concurrently for adaptation. In addition, a
   verifiable condition on the linear independence of the recorded data is
   shown to be sufficient to guarantee global exponential stability and
   adaptive weight convergence. Furthermore, it is shown that the recorded
   data eventually meets this condition after a system switch without any
   additional excitation from the exogenous reference input or knowledge of
   the switching signal if there is sufficient time in between switches.
   That is, after a switch, the system will be automatically excited and
   sufficiently rich data will be recorded. As a result, data that is
   irrelevant to the current subsystem will be overwritten. Thus, reference
   model tracking error and adaptive weight error will eventually become
   globally exponential stable for all switched subsystems. Numerical
   examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   architecture.}},

   multiagent network identifiers with undirected and directed graph
   topologies. Specifically, the system state and plant parameters are
   identified online using N agents implementing adaptive observers with an
   interagent communication architecture. The adaptive observer
   architecture includes an additive term which involves a penalty on the
   mismatch between the state and parameter estimates. The proposed
   architecture is shown to guarantee state and parameter estimate
   consensus. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive identifier architecture
   provides a measure of agreement of the state and parameter estimates
   that is independent of the network topology, and guarantees that the
   deviation from the mean estimate for both the state and parameter
   estimates converge to zero. Finally, an illustrative numerical example
   is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{When considering a distributed control framework for a multi-agent
   system, care has to be taken to respect the limited information
   available to each agent as well as the amount of possible communication
   in the network. This presents difficulties in performing distributed
   model predictive control as an agent must typically be able to simulate
   its neighbors dynamics into the future. We present a framework based on
   parameterized feedback control laws which will allow a multi-agent
   system to perform distributed model predictive control. It enables both
   the simulation of neighbors' states as well as the ability to minimize a
   collective cost in a distributed fashion. Moreover, given cost and
   dynamic dependencies between agents, we characterize the information
   that is needed by each agent to evaluate whether the optimization is
   feasible in a given network.}},

Abstract = {{The Hopping Rotochute is a promising micro vehicle for exploring rough
   and complex terrains with minimum energy consumption. While it is able
   to fly over obstacles via thrust produced by its coaxial rotor, its
   physical architecture, inspired from a ``Weebles Wooble,{''} provides
   reorientation wherever it hits the ground. In this paper, we propose a
   control strategy for a Hopping Rotochute to track any pre-planned
   trajectory autonomously. The proposed control scheme involves some
   parametric hop models to incorporate the dynamics of the vehicle in the
   control selection. Based on the models, an optimization problem is
   solved for the control of each hop during a mission. In this study, we
   conduct some illustrative simulations on a Hopping Rotochute to
   demonstrate the success of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The consensus problem appears frequently in coordination of multiagent
   systems in science and engineering, and involves the agreement of
   networked agents upon certain quantities of interest. In this paper, we
   focus on a new consensus protocol for networked multiagent systems using
   a resetting control architecture. Specifically, the control protocol
   consists of a delayed feedback, quasi-resetting control law such that
   controller resettings occur when the relative state measurements between
   an agent and its neighboring agents are zero. In contrast to standard
   impulsive resetting controllers, the proposed resetting is uniformly
   continuous, and hence, our approach does not require any well-posedness
   assumptions imposed by impulsive resetting controllers. In addition,
   using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the multiagent
   system reaches asymptotic state equipartitioning, where the system
   steady-state is uniformly distributed over the system initial
   conditions. Finally, we develop L-infinity transient performance
   guarantees while accounting for system overshoot and excessive control
   effort.}},

   self-assembly systems is proposed in this paper. The colloidal assembly

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a new model reference control architecture for
   uncertain dynamical systems that can effectively suppress the system
   uncertainties and achieve a guaranteed system performance. The proposed
   approach neither resorts to nonlinear adaptive control laws nor relies
   on excessive modeling information as often done in traditional robust
   control frameworks. It only requires a parameterization of the system
   uncertainty given by unknown weights with known conservative bounds in
   order to stabilize the uncertain dynamical system. The proposed
   methodology is based on a recently developed command governor theory
   that minimizes the effect of system uncertainty and shapes the system's
   input through feedback in order to improve overall system performance.
   Specifically, we show the controlled uncertain dynamical system
   approximates a given ideal reference system by properly choosing the
   design parameter of the command governor. Unlike model reference
   adaptive control approaches, the proposed model reference controller
   preserves linearity of the controlled uncertain dynamical system since
   its control laws are linear, and hence, the closed-loop performance is
   predictable for different command spectrums. A numerical example is
   provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.}},

   controllers for the position and attitude of a rigid body with and

   The combined position and attitude velocity-free controller exploits the

Abstract = {{While adaptive control has been used in numerous applications to achieve
   system performance without excessive reliance on dynamical system
   models, the necessity of highga-in learning rates to achieve fast
   adaptation can be a serious limitation of adaptive controllers. This is
   due to the fact that fast adaptation using high-gain learning rates can
   cause high-frequency oscillations in the control response resulting in
   system instability. In this paper, we present a new adaptive control
   architecture for nonlinear safety-critical uncertain dynamical systems
   to address the problem of achieving fast adaptation using high-gain
   learning rates. The proposed framework involves a new and novel
   controller architecture involving a modification term in the update law.
   Specifically, this modification term filters out the high-frequency
   content contained in the update law while preserving asymptotic
   stability of the system error dynamics. This key feature of our
   framework allows for robust, fast adaptation in the face of high-gain
   learning rates. Furthermore, we show that transient and steady-state
   system performance is guaranteed with the proposed architecture. Two
   illustrative numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy
   of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of stochastic stability is used in game theoretic learning to
   characterize which joint actions of players exhibit high probabilities
   of occurrence in the long run. This paper examines the impact of two
   types of errors on stochastic stability: i) small unstructured
   uncertainty in the game parameters and ii) slow time variations of the
   game parameters. In the first case, we derive a continuity result bounds
   the effects of small uncertainties. In the second case, we show that
   game play tracks drifting stochastically stable states under
   sufficiently slow time variations. The analysis is in terms of Markov
   chains and hence is applicable to a variety of game theoretic learning
   rules. Nonetheless, the approach is illustrated on the widely studied
   rule of log-linear learning. Finally, the results are applied in both
   simulation and laboratory experiments to distributed area coverage with
   mobile robots.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new adaptive control architecture to achieve
   stabilization and command following of uncertain dynamical systems with
   improved transient performance. Our framework consists of a new
   reference system and an adaptive controller. The proposed reference
   system captures a desired closed-loop dynamical system behavior modified
   by a mismatch term representing the high-frequency content between the
   uncertain dynamical system and this reference system, i.e., the system
   error. In particular, this mismatch term allows one to limit the
   frequency content of the system error dynamics, which is used to drive
   the adaptive controller. It is shown that this key feature of our
   framework yields fast adaptation without incurring high-frequency
   oscillations in the transient performance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the control of torque-based steering assist systems for
   improving yaw rate tracking and vehicle stabilization. As opposed to
   active front steering systems based on harmonic motors, torque-based
   steering assist systems are mechanically coupled with the driver. Thus,
   besides standard vehicle and actuators constraints, specific constraints
   related to the driver-actuator interaction need to be enforced. These
   constraints can be formulated to achieve a multiplicity of goals,
   including avoiding excessive strain in the driver's arms, and preserving
   the driver's ``feel for the road{''}. In order to achieve high control
   performance and constraints satisfaction, we implement controllers based
   on linear and switched model predictive control, where different types
   of driver's steering feel constraints are enforced. The different
   controllers are evaluated in simulation maneuvers to analyze their
   capabilities and the impact of the constraints in terms of vehicle
   cornering, stabilization, and driver's steering feel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new formation framework for networked multiagent
   systems that can be used for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that the
   proposed framework minimizes a cost function while satisfying state and
   control constraints. Furthermore, agents converge to a formation such
   that the difference in the Laplacian potential of the constrained and
   desired formation is locally minimized. The proposed framework relies on
   an easily implementable local optimization process, whose computation
   load is independent on the network size. Therefore, the framework is
   scalable and decentralized. The proposed framework can be easily
   integrated into existing multiagent system guidance protocols in order
   to avoid obstacles. Several numerical examples are provided to
   demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{11121-11140}},
Abstract = {{The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from four C-12 alkanes
   (n-dodecane, 2-methylundecane, hexylcyclohexane, and cyclododecane) is
   studied in the Caltech Environmental Chamber under low-NOx conditions,
   in which the principal fate of the peroxy radical formed in the initial
   OH reaction is reaction with HO2. Simultaneous gas- and particle-phase
   measurements elucidate the effect of alkane structure on the chemical
   mechanisms underlying SOA growth. Reaction of branched structures leads
   to fragmentation and more volatile products, while cyclic structures are
   subject to faster oxidation and lead to less volatile products. Product
   identifications reveal that particle-phase reactions involving
   peroxyhemiacetal formation from several multifunctional hydroperoxide
   species are key components of initial SOA growth in all four systems.
   The continued chemical evolution of the particle-phase is
   structure-dependent, with 2-methylundecane SOA formation exhibiting the
   least extent of chemical processing and cyclododecane SOA achieving
   sustained growth with the greatest variety of chemical pathways. The
   extent of chemical development is not necessarily reflected in the
   oxygen to carbon (O : C) ratio of the aerosol as cyclododecane achieves
   the lowest O : C, just above 0.2, by the end of the experiment and
   hexylcyclohexane the highest, approaching 0.35.}},

   Blocker in a Single Scan: Phantom Studies}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any
   medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Excessive imaging
   dose from repeated scans and poor image quality mainly due to scatter
   contamination are the two bottlenecks of cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging.
   Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithms show promises in
   recovering faithful signals from low-dose projection data but do not
   serve well the needs of accurate CBCT imaging if effective scatter
   correction is not in place. Scatter can be accurately measured and
   removed using measurement-based methods. However, these approaches are
   considered unpractical in the conventional FDK reconstruction, due to
   the inevitable primary loss for scatter measurement. We combine
   measurement-based scatter correction and CS-based iterative
   reconstruction to generate scatter-free images from low-dose
   projections. We distribute blocked areas on the detector where primary
   signals are considered redundant in a full scan. Scatter distribution is
   estimated by interpolating/extrapolating measured scatter samples inside
   blocked areas. CS-based iterative reconstruction is finally carried out
   on the undersampled data to obtain scatter-free and low-dose CBCT
   images. With only 25\% of conventional full-scan dose, our method
   reduces the average CT number error from 250HU to 24HU and increases the
   contrast by a factor of 2.1 on Catphan 600 phantom. On an
   anthropomorphic head phantom, the average CT number error is reduced
   from 224HU to 10HU in the central uniform area.}},

Abstract = {{Metagenomics has revolutionized microbiological studies during the past
   decade and provided new insights into the diversity, dynamics, and
   metabolic potential of natural microbial communities. However,
   metagenomics still represents a field in development, and standardized
   tools and approaches to handle and compare metagenomes have not been
   established yet. An important reason accounting for the latter is the
   continuous changes in the type of sequencing data available, for
   example, long versus short sequencing reads. Here, we provide a guide to
   bioinformatic pipelines developed to accomplish the following tasks,
   focusing primarily on those developed by our team: (i) assemble a
   metagenomic dataset; (ii) determine the level of sequence coverage
   obtained and the amount of sequencing required to obtain complete
   coverage; (iii) identify the taxonomic affiliation of a metagenomic read
   or assembled contig; and (iv) determine differentially abundant genes,
   pathways, and species between different datasets. Most of these
   pipelines do not depend on the type of sequences available or can be
   easily adjusted to fit different types of sequences, and are freely
   available (for instance, through our lab Web site:
   http://www.enve-omics.gatech.edu/). The limitations of current
   approaches, as well as the computational aspects that can be further
   improved, will also be briefly discussed. The work presented here
   provides practical guidelines on how to perform metagenomic analysis of
   microbial communities characterized by varied levels of diversity and
   establishes approaches to handle the resulting data, independent of the
   sequencing platform employed.}},

Abstract = {{Size-tunable crystalline core-crystalline shell Zn2GeO4 nanorods were
   synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction. High purity Zn2GeO4
   nanorods were obtained at pH = 7. The length of Zn2GeO4 nanorods (L =
   50-100 nm) can be controlled through a one-step process, while
   micro-sized nanorods with an aspect ratio of the length to the diameter
   of 10 were yielded in a two-step process. The single crystalline nature
   of Zn2GeO4 nanorods with a core-shell structure was verified by high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area
   electron diffraction (SAED) measurements. The Raman study revealed that
   there is no oxygen defect (V-O(center dot)) in Zn2GeO4 nanocrystals,

Pages = {{12532-12541}},
Abstract = {{A unique technique to perform quantitative in situ transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) fatigue testing on ultrathin films and nanomaterials is
   demonstrated. The technique relies on a microelectromechanical system
   (MEMS) device to actuate a nanospecimen and measure its mechanical
   response. Compared to previously demonstrated MEMS-based in situ TEM
   techniques, the technique takes advantage of two identical capacitive
   sensors on each side of the specimen to measure electronically
   elongation (with nm resolution) and applied force (with mu N
   resolution). Monotonic and fatigue tests were performed on
   nanocrystalline gold ultrathin film specimens that were manipulated and
   fixed onto the MEMS device without the use of a focused ion-beam
   microscope (and therefore, importantly, without any associated surface
   damage). The major advantage of the technique is its capability to use
   TEM imaging solely for high magnification microstructural observations
   while the MEMS device provides continuous tracking of the material's
   response, thereby expanding the capabilities of MEMS-based techniques
   towards more complex in situ TEM nanomechanical tests, such as fatigue
   tests.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{25184-25189}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrated a flexible self-powered system that consists of a strain
   sensor and a nanogenerator. An individual ZnSnO3 microbelt was bonded at
   its ends to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate to fabricate a
   strain sensor and a single-nanobelt nanogenerator. The sensor and
   nanogenerator were connected in series and packaged by a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer. The ZnSnO3 belongs to a R3C point
   group that exhibited a large piezopotential along the z-axis, so that it
   can be either a power source or a sensor. The piezopotential can drive
   electrons to flow in the circuit and serve as a power source. The
   piezopotential can also tune the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the
   contact by varying the tensile and compressive strain owing to the
   piezotronic effect, so that it can serve as a strain sensor. The output
   current decreased as compressive strain increased, but the current
   increased as tensile strain increased. The sensor can be switched by
   bending the flexible substrate, which can act as a highly effective
   reversible electromechanical switcher.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal Global Positioning System Travel Data and Breach of Privacy
   via Enhanced Spatial and Demographic Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2354}},
Pages = {{86-98}},
Abstract = {{Longitudinal Global Positioning System (GPS) travel data provide a
   wealth of information related to travel behavior and on-road vehicle
   behavior that is very valuable to researchers. Sharing the data publicly
   allows researchers to explore the data and create new knowledge beyond
   the initial research objectives. However, if any data are to be used
   outside a secure server, the data must be processed in such a manner
   that ensures that the confidentiality of the data will not be breached.
   High-resolution GPS data (e.g., second-by-second speed and location
   information), when associated with the individual households or drivers,
   compromise privacy and have a significant potential to harm human
   subjects. This paper explores how data from the Commute Atlanta study in
   Georgia could be processed to make it useful to researchers while
   participants' privacy is protected. The research developed and assessed
   methodologies designed to identify the individual participant's home
   location from processed data and then tested analytical data sets for
   breach of privacy. The research effort found that the home location
   could be identified to within reasonably small neighborhoods; when the
   household demographic information was included in the data sets (which
   was necessary for researchers), exact households could be identified.
   Although some new data-processing approaches might be used to eliminate
   privacy concerns, until such systems are developed and proved to be
   unbreachable through rigorous analysis, the Georgia Institute of
   Technology team has determined that researchers should access the
   high-resolution data in controlled secure labs and that the data sets
   should not be made public without additional efforts to ensure that home
   locations cannot be identified when external data sources are leveraged
   in the analyses.}},

   Theory to Manage Multiple Assets}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2354}},
Pages = {{99-106}},
Abstract = {{Simultaneous consideration of various types of assets and investment
   objectives for the purpose of allocating resources more efficiently can
   improve the systemwide performance of the transportation system. Various
   studies have been conducted on the development of management systems
   such as those for pavements, signs, mobility, safety, and preservation.
   However, not as many studies specifically investigate the synergistic
   effects of these systems on transportation system performance. This
   paper develops a multiattribute utility model that identifies high-risk
   corridors in a transportation system for prioritization on the basis of
   multiple objectives and various assets. Three objectives are used in
   evaluating the performance of the system: minimizing the number of
   incidents, maximizing mobility, and improving preservation of assets.
   The methodology is generally applicable to system-level management of
   transportation systems. The model is applied to a selected corridor in
   the state of Georgia. Results illustrate that the developed model can
   aid transportation agencies in identifying high-risk corridors that
   degrade the performance of their transportation system. This model can
   be used in identifying high-risk corridors during program development.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown the existence of considerable amount of
   packet-level redundancy in the network flows. Since application-layer
   solutions cannot capture the packet-level redundancy, development of new
   content-aware approaches capable of redundancy elimination at the packet
   and sub-packet levels is necessary. These requirements motivate the
   redundancy elimination of packets from an information-theoretic point of
   view. For efficient compression of packets, a new framework called
   memory-assisted universal compression has been proposed. This framework
   is based on learning the statistics of the source generating the packets
   at some intermediate nodes and then leveraging these statistics to
   effectively compress a new packet. This paper investigates both
   theoretically and experimentally the memory-assisted compression of
   network packets. Clearly, a simple source cannot model the data traffic.
   Hence, we consider traffic from a complex source that is consisted of a
   mixture of simple information sources for our analytic study. We develop
   a practical code for memory-assisted compression and combine it with a
   proposed hierarchical clustering to better utilize the memory. Finally,
   we validate our results via simulation on real traffic traces.
   Memory-assisted compression combined with hierarchical clustering method
   results in compression of packets close to the fundamental limit. As a
   result, we report a factor of two improvement over traditional
   end-to-end compression.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a distributed detection application for a fusion center that
   has a limited time to make a global decision by collecting, weighting,
   and fusing local decisions made by nodes in a wireless sensor network
   that uses a random access channel. When this time is not long enough to
   collect decisions from all nodes in the network, a strategy is needed
   for collecting those with the highest reliability. This is accomplished
   with an easily implemented modification of the random access protocol:
   the collection time is divided into frames and only nodes with a
   particular range of reliabilities compete for the channel within each
   frame. Nodes with the most reliable decisions attempt transmission in
   the first frame; nodes with the next most reliable set of decisions
   attempt in the next frame; etc. We formulate an optimization problem
   that determines the reliability interval that defines who attempts in
   each frame in order to minimize the Detection Error Probability (DEP) at
   the fusion center. When the noise distribution affecting nodes' local
   decisions is continuous, symmetric, unimodal, and has a monotone
   likelihood ratio, reliability thresholds that maximize the channel
   throughput in each frame are optimal when the ratio of the collection
   time to the number of nodes is small. The number of frames that should
   be used depends on whether the average reliability or the worst-case
   reliability of local decisions in each frame is used to determine the
   DEP.}},

Title = {{A dynamic control system model for global temperature change and sea
   level rise in response to CO2 emissions}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Abstract = {{Greenhouse gas emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources are
   frequently cited as the dominant cause of global warming. One adverse
   effect of global warming caused by these emissions is sea level rise,
   which poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of
   coastal regions around the world. In this study we use concepts from
   dynamic systems control theory to develop a systems model that may be
   used to predict global temperature change and sea level rise. The model
   uses the radiative forcing function as an external input to represent
   the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the dynamic system. The
   dynamic system is calibrated using historical data on global temperature
   and sea level. An independent emission scenario, which results in a 2 C
   increase of temperature by 2100, is used to validate the model. The
   numerical results show that the model proposed is effective in
   predicting future global temperature change and future sea level rise.
   We then apply the proposed model to the 6 CO2 emission scenarios
   generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The
   projections indicate that global temperature will increase between 1.6
   and 5.0 degrees C by 2100 and that sea level will rise between 60.3 and
   98.4 cm relative to the 1990 level. These results are consistent with
   projections made by the IPCC and with results of other recent studies
   that used semi-empirical approaches.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{P506-P514}},
Abstract = {{Methane-(CH4) based subtractive plasma etching of Cu was investigated at
   low temperature. The Cu etch rate using a CH4 plasma (17 nm/min) was
   higher than that of an H-2 plasma (13 nm/min) under the same plasma
   conditions, despite the fact that hydrocarbon deposition was evident
   with CH4. The higher Cu etch rate is ascribed to increased momentum
   transfer due to the heavier mass of CH+ and C+ relative to H+ and to the
   more thermodynamically stable etch products of CH3Cu or CH3CuH- relative
   to CuHx. Methyl-containing Cu etch product species were not detected by
   optical emission spectroscopy, most likely because Cu-CH3 was readily
   dissociated by energetic electron impact collisions after desorption
   from the Cu surface. Patterns generated in Cu displayed a sidewall angle
   of similar to 80 degrees, similar to that of H-2 plasma patterning, but
   unlike the result in an H-2 plasma, a photoresist mask was not
   significantly degraded during the etch process. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Here, we demonstrate a new approach for the synthesis of ion exchange
   microfibers with finely tuned anhydrous conductivity. This work presents
   microfluidics as a system to control the size and phosphoric acid (PA)
   doping level of the polybenzimidazole (PBI) microfibers. It has been
   shown that the PA doping level can be controlled by varying the flow
   ratios in the microfluidic channel. The diameter of the microfibers
   increased with extending mixing time, whereas the doping level decreased
   with increasing flow ratio. The highest doping level, 16, was achieved
   at the flow ratio of 0.175. The anhydrous proton conductivity of the
   microfibers was found to be adjustable between 0.01 and 0.1 S cm(-1) at
   160 degrees C, which is considerably higher than for conventionally
   doped PBI cast membranes (0.004 S cm(-1)). Furthermore, molecular
   dynamic simulation of proton conduction through the microfibers at
   different doping levels was in good agreement with the experimental
   results. These results demonstrate the potential of the microfluidic
   technique to precisely tune the physicochemical properties of PBI
   microfibers for various electrochemical applications such as hydrogen
   sensors, fuel cells as well as artificial muscles.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro recapitulation of mammalian embryogenesis and examination of
   the emerging behaviours of embryonic structures require both the means
   to engineer complexity and accurately assess phenotypes of multicellular
   aggregates. Current approaches to study multicellular populations in 3D
   configurations are limited by the inability to create complex (i.e.
   spatially heterogeneous) environments in a reproducible manner with high
   fidelity thus impeding the ability to engineer microenvironments and
   combinations of cells with similar complexity to that found during
   morphogenic processes such as development, remodelling and wound
   healing. Here, we develop a multicellular embryoid body (EB) fusion
   technique as a higher-throughput in vitro tool, compared to a manual
   assembly, to generate developmentally relevant embryonic patterns. We
   describe the physical principles of the EB fusion microfluidic device
   design; we demonstrate that >60 conjoined EBs can be generated overnight
   and emulate a development process analogous to mouse gastrulation during
   early embryogenesis. Using temporal delivery of bone morphogenic protein
   4 (BMP4) to embryoid bodies, we recapitulate embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5)
   during mouse embryo development with induced mesoderm differentiation in
   murine embryonic stem cells leading to expression of Brachyury-T-green
   fluorescent protein (T-GFP), an indicator of primitive streak
   development and mesoderm differentiation during gastrulation. The
   proposed microfluidic approach could be used to manipulate hundreds or
   more of individual embryonic cell aggregates in a rapid fashion, thereby
   allowing controlled differentiation patterns in fused multicellular
   assemblies to generate complex yet spatially controlled
   microenvironments.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is ideally suited for probing
   and mapping surface species and incipient phases on fuel cell electrodes
   because of its high sensitivity and surface-selectivity, potentially
   offering insights into the mechanisms of chemical and energy
   transformation processes. In particular, bimetal nano-structures of
   coinage metals (Au, Ag, and Cu) have attracted much attention as
   SERS-active agents due to their distinctive electromagnetic field
   enhancements originated from surface plasmon resonance. Here we report
   excellent SERS-active, raspberry-like nanostructures composed of a
   silver (Ag) nanoparticle core decorated with smaller copper (Cu)
   nanoparticles, which displayed enhanced and broadened UV-Vis absorption
   spectra. These unique Ag@Cu raspberry nanostructures enable us to use
   blue, green, and red light as the excitation laser source for
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with a large enhancement
   factor (EF). A highly reliable SERS effect was demonstrated using
   Rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules and a thin film of gadolinium doped ceria.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous success of the iPad has led to a revolution in portable
   computing. Many universities, high schools, and elementary schools are
   attempting to capitalize on this revolution by generating curricula that
   exploit such portable touchscreen computers. One aspect of this effort
   is the development of interactive textbooks that go beyond the static
   display of printed words, equations, and figures. Features that
   distinguish interactive textbooks include: embedded videos that can be
   viewed with the tap of a finger, picture slideshows, user-controlled
   simulations, and interactive forms that accept user input and provide
   immediate feedback. Unfortunately, the skill sets required to generate
   such books usually do not reside in one person. Professors have the
   knowledge and skills to produce traditional textbooks, but they usually
   lack the knowledge, skill, and time to make the interactive elements.
   Undergraduate and graduate students can be trained to develop the
   programming skills to develop the interactive elements, but they lack
   the knowledge and experience to create the traditional aspects of a
   textbook. This paper describes how a team was formed to produce an
   interactive textbook, and it documents the features of such a book
   created for introductory mechanical design students.}},

Abstract = {{Reference spur is a nonlinear effect and important specification in PLL
   for long term jitter. Periodic events of reference clock create a static
   phase offset between signals. The finite phase offset comes from charge
   pump mismatch and layout asymmetry. This paper presents a built-in
   self-test (BIST) circuit applied for PLL static phase offset (SPO)
   estimation. The proposed circuit takes advantage of an integrator for
   time-to-voltage conversion (TVC). Along with comparators and counters, a
   BIST can be constructed for an estimation of mismatch ratio down to 1\%
   over process corners in simulation (10 psec for 1nsec pulse width). The
   calibration can be operated in a closed-loop PLL with lock signal.
   Additional circuits including delay lines and non-inverting amplifiers
   are designed for fast calibration. The result shows at least 27 times
   faster detection speed can be achieved over process corners. The phase
   offset between PLL reference and feedback signal is essentially the duty
   cycle difference, and the test is also applied for duty cycle
   distortion. Related analysis and measurement are included.}},

   system cost. Therefore, it is very important to develop the right energy

   hypothetical impacts of photovoltaic systems in the operational cost of
   the grid of the State of Georgia. Spinning reserve is modeled as ten gas
   power plants providing together equal capacity whose costs are
   stochastically calculated. The economic emissions dispatch is then
   calculated to obtain the hourly distribution of the annual generation.
   Also, the daily operation of PV and gas turbines in minute resolution is
   simulated to obtain results from the standpoint of costs imposed by
   rapid changes of PV output and use of spinning reserve in comparison
   with the results obtained when spinning reserve is not used. The results
   indicate that with current costs, significant reduction of emissions
   occurs as expected, however the total production costs increases.}},

Abstract = {{An On-demand Scheduling Cooperative MAC protocol (OSC-MAC) is proposed
   to address the energy hole problem in multi-hop wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs). By combining an on-demand strategy and sensor cooperation
   intended to extend range, OSC-MAC tackles the spatio-temporal challenges
   for performing cooperative transmission (CT) in multi-hop WSN:
   cooperating nodes are neither on the same duty cycle nor are they in the
   same collision domain. We use orthogonal and pipelined duty-cycle
   scheduling, in part to reduce traffic contention, and devise a
   reservation-based wake-up scheme to bring cooperating nodes into
   temporary synchrony to support CT range extension. Compared with

Abstract = {{Theoretically optimal performance and behavior of a routing protocol are
   very important because they can be used to guide the design of practical
   protocols. Motivated by the promising lifetime performance of an
   existing online cooperative transmission (CT) routing protocol for
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs), we formulate the lifetime optimization
   problem of cooperative routing using linear programming (LP), which
   requires considerations of CT's unique characteristics and sophisticated
   variable definitions. By using our LP, one can obtain the optimal
   lifetime of multi-hop WSNs that use cooperative routing, which can serve
   as a performance bound or a benchmark to compare to the lifetimes of
   existing routing protocols. Through the evaluations of our LP, we show
   the benefit of cooperative routing and usefulness of our LP formulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an optimal scheme for a distributed antenna
   system (DAS) to maximize energy efficiency (EE) under a constraint of
   overall transmit power of each remote access unit (RAU). We exploit the
   multicriteria optimization method to systematically investigate the
   relationship between EE and spectral efficiency (SE). Using the weighted
   sum method, we first convert the multicriteria optimization function,
   which is extremely complex, into a simpler single objective optimization
   function. Then an optimal algorithm is developed to allocate the
   available power to tradeoff EE and SE effectively. Furthermore, we also
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate
   there is a tradeoff between energy-efficient and spectral-efficient
   transmission through computer simulation of a downlink multiuser DAS.}},

Abstract = {{From security perspective, a friendly relay may help to keep the
   confidential messages from being eavesdropped, while an untrusted relay
   may intentionally eavesdrop the messages when relaying. This paper
   studies the secure beamforming for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   two-way communications, where two source nodes exchange information with
   the help of an untrusted relay node. The relay adopts
   amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy and acts as both an essential helper
   and a potential eavesdropper. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy sum
   rate of the bidirectional links by jointly optimizing the source and
   relay beamformers. For the two-phase two-way relay scheme, we first
   derive the optimal structure of the relay beamformer and then propose an
   iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the source and relay
   beamformers. Then, a comprehensive study on the asymptotical performance
   is conducted by letting the source and relay powers approach zero or
   infinity. In particular, we show that when all powers approach infinity,
   the two-way relay scheme achieves the maximum secrecy rate if the
   transceiver beamformers are designed such that the received signals at
   the relay can be aligned to be parallel.}},

Abstract = {{The role of MO4 (M = W, Mo) orientational disorder in the thermal
   expansion and compressibility of ZrW2O8 and ZrMo2O8 was investigated via
   in situ powder X-ray diffraction at elevated temperature and pressure. A
   dramatic reduction in the bulk modulus of alpha-ZrW2O8, which has
   ordered WO4 tetrahedra at room temperature, from 65 GPa at room
   temperature to 47 GPa at 386 K was observed to be concomitant with the
   onset of a reversible WO4 orientational disordering upon compression.
   Additionally, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the alpha
   phase became more negative upon compression within the temperature range
   in which pressure-dependent disorder was observed; alpha(l), over the
   range 298 to 386 K, was similar to-11 ppm K-1 at 35 MPa but similar
   to-16 ppm K-1 at 276 MPa. No softening upon heating or change in CTE
   upon compression was observed for ZrW2O8 above the order -> disorder
   phase transition temperature. Cubic ZrMo2O8 has a disordered arrangement
   of MoO4 tetrahedra at all temperatures and pressures accessed in this
   study. Its bulk modulus was independent of temperature, and its CTE was
   insensitive to pressure, much like beta-ZrW2O8. The
   stability/metastability of the cubic and orthorhombic phases upon
   heating above room temperature and compression is discussed, with a
   focus on changes in the thermodynamics and kinetics of the cubic <->
   orthorhombic transition.}},

Abstract = {{This review provides a comprehensive assessment of recently improved
   carbon dioxide (CO2) separation and capture systems, used in power
   plants and other industrial processes. Different approaches for CO2
   capture are pre-combustion, post-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion
   systems, which are reviewed, along with their advantages and
   disadvantages. New technologies and prospective ``breakthrough
   technologies{''}, for instance: novel solvents, sorbents, and membranes
   for gas separation are examined. Other technologies including chemical
   looping technology (reaction between metal oxides and fuels, creating
   metal particles, carbon dioxide, and water vapor) and cryogenic
   separation processes (based on different phase change temperatures for
   various gases to separate them) are reviewed as well. Furthermore, the
   major CO2 separation technologies, such as absorption (using a liquid
   solvent to absorb the CO2), adsorption (using solid materials with
   surface affinity to CO2 molecules), and membranes (using a thin film to
   selectively permeate gases) are extensively discussed, though issues and
   technologies related to CO2 transport and storage are not considered in
   this paper.}},

Pages = {{23178-23183}},
Abstract = {{Different from most ionic diodes which use water as the medium, in this
   paper, we reported flexible solid state ionic diodes without water
   during the fabrication and operation. The ionic diodes were fabricated
   by sandwiching a PEO-doped separator sheet between two paper sheets,
   respectively doped with AgNO3-polyethylene oxide (PEO) and KI-PEO
   electrolyte. The working mechanism of the solid diodes was based on the
   different electrochemical and participation reactions under different
   bias. The rectification ratio of the diode devices could reach 46 under
   an input AC voltage between +/- 1 V. The devices exhibited good
   flexibility and showed stable rectifying behavior after more than 800
   bending cycles. The effects of plasticizer on the rectifying
   performances of diodes were systematically studied. The stability of the
   devices fabricated with or without plasticizer in PEO was investigated.
   The results showed that there was a trade-off between rectifying
   performance and stability.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of metal ion doping on electronic band structure and charge
   carriers' effective mass of Ta2O5 were studied using hybrid functionals
   in density functional theory. PBE0 hybrid functional proved to be very
   efficient in predicting the band structure with less than 5\% error
   compared to experimental data. The bandgap decreases monotonically as
   the percentage of the dopant increases. Furthermore, the indirect
   bandgap behavior of Ta2O5 was found to initially increase with doping
   before it decreases again to its original value of pristine Ta2O5. We
   found that high doping content or even mixing with another metal is
   required in order to modify the band structure of Ta2O5. The effect of
   doping on the crystal structure was also studied. XRD measurements show
   that the crystal lattice tends to expand upon doping with metals with
   larger atomic radius than Ta and this effect is more pronounced as the
   dopant content increases.}},

Abstract = {{While router buffers have been used as performance multipliers, they are
   also major consumers of area and power in on-chip networks. In this
   paper, we propose centralized elastic bubble router - a router
   micro-architecture based on the use of centralized buffers (CB) with
   elastic buffered (EB) links. At low loads, the CB is power gated,
   bypassed, and optimized to produce single cycle operation. A novel
   extension to bubble flow control enables routing deadlock and message
   dependent deadlock to be avoided with the same mechanism having constant
   buffer size per router independent of the number of message types. This
   solution enables end-to-end latency reduction via high radix switches
   with low overall buffer requirements. Comparisons made with other low
   latency routers across different topologies show consistent performance
   improvement, for example 26\% improvement in no load latency of a 2D
   Mesh and 4X improvement in saturation throughput in a 2D-Generalized
   Hypercube.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change can exacerbate future regional air pollution events by
   making conditions more favorable to form high levels of ozone. In this
   study, we use spectral nudging with the Weather Research and Forecasting
   (WRF) model to downscale NASA earth system GISS modelE2 results during
   the years 2006 to 2010 and 2048 to 2052 over the contiguous United
   States in order to compare the resulting meteorological fields from the
   air quality perspective during the four seasons of five-year historic
   and future climatological periods. GISS results are used as initial and
   boundary conditions by the WRF regional climate model (RCM) to produce
   hourly meteorological fields. The downscaling technique and choice of
   physics parameterizations used are evaluated by comparing them with in
   situ observations. This study investigates changes of similar regional
   climate conditions down to a 12 km by 12 km resolution, as well as the
   effect of evolving climate conditions on the air quality at major US
   cities. The high-resolution simulations produce somewhat different
   results than the coarse-resolution simulations in some regions. Also,
   through the analysis of the meteorological variables that most strongly
   influence air quality, we find consistent changes in regional climate
   that would enhance ozone levels in four regions of the US during fall
   (western US, Texas, northeastern, and southeastern US), one region
   during summer (Texas), and one region where changes potentially would
   lead to better air quality during spring (Northeast). Changes in
   regional climate that would enhance ozone levels are increased
   temperatures and stagnation along with decreased precipitation and
   ventilation. We also find that daily peak temperatures tend to increase
   in most major cities in the US, which would increase the risk of health
   problems associated with heat stress. Future work will address a more
   comprehensive assessment of emissions and chemistry involved in the
   formation and removal of air pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{In digital tomosynthesis imaging, multiple projections of an object are
   obtained along a small range of different incident angles in order to
   reconstruct a pseudo-3D representation of the object. In this paper we
   discuss a mathematical model for polyenergetic digital breast
   tomosynthesis image reconstruction that explicitly takes into account
   various materials composing the object and the polyenergetic nature of
   the x-ray beam. Our model allows for computing weight fractions of the
   individual materials that make up the object, which can then be used to
   reconstruct pseudo-3D images. The reconstruction process requires
   solving a large-scale inverse problem, which is done with a gradient
   descent iteration. Regularization is enforced by truncating the
   iteration. The mathematical model is described in detail, as is an
   efficient approach to compute the gradient of the objective function.
   The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with real data taken of
   an object with known materials that simulates an actual breast.}},

Title = {{Effect of catenation and basicity of pillared ligands on the water
   stability of MOFs}},
Journal = {{DALTON TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{15421-15426}},
Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have extremely high surface areas and
   pore volumes, tunable pore sizes and chemical functionalities and are an
   interesting addition to the field of porous materials. One of the key
   challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied
   level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here
   seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important
   contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pK(a) value) of
   the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the
   interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and
   independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in
   combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water
   stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pK(a)
   value). This study shows that after 90\% relative humidity (RH)
   exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508),
   MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents
   significant water adsorption. In contrast, comparing non-catenated
   isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY
   (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher
   pK(a)) and less rigid than DABCO.}},

   antennas, enabled by a new printable dielectric ink that allows for the
   deposition of thick dielectric layers. Printed coupled patch antennas
   with realized gains of over 4 dBi and four-element coupled patch arrays
   with gains of over 7 dBi are demonstrated on a flexible liquid crystal
   polymer (LCP) substrate. The antenna gain, return loss, and pattern are

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2343}},
Pages = {{62-67}},
Abstract = {{The presented methodology estimates parameters of a nested logit model
   when decision makers who choose one of the alternatives are
   systematically excluded from the sample data that are used to estimate
   the model (i.e., censored). Unlike existing methods for estimating
   discrete choice model parameters with censored data, which require
   exogenous information beyond the specification of the model to be
   estimated and the available sampled observations, the proposed method
   requires no additional outside information. It is demonstrated
   empirically that this approach can recover not only generic model
   parameters that apply to common attributes of all alternatives but also
   parameters for alternative-specific constants and variables associated
   with both observed and censored alternatives. Although the standard
   errors of the estimated parameters are larger than those of models
   estimated with uncensored data, censored data methods still hold great
   potential for applications in which uncensored data are expensive or
   impossible to collect.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution imaging in ultraviolet (UV) bands has many applications
   in defense and commercial systems. The shortest wavelength is desired
   for increased spatial resolution, which allows for small pixels and
   large formats. In past work, UV avalanche photodiodes (APDs) have been
   reported as discrete devices demonstrating gain. The next frontier is to
   develop UVAPD arrays with high gain to demonstrate high-resolution
   imaging.
   We will discuss a model that can predict sensor performance in the UV
   band using APDs with various gain and other parameters for a desired UV
   band of interest. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can be modeled from
   illuminated targets at various distances with high resolution under
   standard atmospheric conditions in the UV band and the solar-blind
   region using detector arrays with unity gain and with high-gain APDs. We
   will present recent data on the GaN-based APDs for their gain, detector
   response, dark current noise, and 1/f noise.
   We will discuss various approaches and device designs that are being
   evaluated for developing APDs in wide-bandgap semiconductors. The paper
   will also discuss the state of the art in UVAPDs and the future
   directions for small unit cell size and gain in the APDs.}},

Abstract = {{Higher energy density batteries are desired, especially for mobile
   electronic devices. Lithium metal anodes are a possible route to
   achieving high energy and power density due to their light weight
   compared to current graphite anodes. However, whisker growth during
   lithium electrodeposition (i.e. charging) represents a serious safety
   and efficiency concern for both lithium metal batteries and overcharging
   of graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries. The initial morphology of
   deposited lithium nuclei can have a significant impact on the bulk
   material deposited. The nucleation of lithium metal from an organic
   ethylene carbonate: dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC) and an ionic liquid
   (trimethylbutylammonium bis(triflouromethanesulfonyl)imide) electrolyte
   has been studied. Whisker extrusion and tip-based dendrite growth was
   observed ex-situ, and confirmed by in-situ optical microscopy
   experiments. The nucleation of a non-dendritic sodium co-deposit is also
   discussed. A model based on nuclei geometry is provided which gives
   insight into the deposition rate at constant overpotential. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The fully developed speckle (multiplicative noise) naturally appears in
   coherent imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar. Since the
   speckle is multiplicative, it is difficult to interpret observed data.
   Total variation (TV) based variational models have recently been used in
   the removal of the speckle because of the strong edge preserving
   property of TV and reasonable computational cost. However, the fidelity
   term (or negative log-likelihood) of the original variational model
   {[}G. Aubert and J.-F. Aujol, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 68 (2008), pp.
   925-946], which appears on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, is not
   convex. Recently, the logarithmic transformation and the mth root
   transformation have been proposed to relax the nonconvexity. It is
   empirically observed that the mth root transform based variational model
   outperforms the log transform based variational model. However, the
   performance of the mth root transform based model critically depends on
   the choice of m. In this paper, we propose the two-level convex relaxed
   variational model; i.e., we relax the original variational model by
   using the mth root transformation and the concave conjugate. We also
   adapt the two-block nonlinear Gauss-Seidel method to solve the proposed
   model. The performance of the proposed model does not depend on the
   choice of m, and the model shows overall better performance than the
   logarithmic transformed variational model and the mth root transformed
   variational model.}},

Abstract = {{The data center industry has experienced significant growth over the
   last decade, mainly due to the increased use of the internet for our day
   to day activities such as e-commerce, social media, video streaming and
   healthcare. This growth in demand results in higher energy costs, as
   data centers can be energy intensive facilities. A significant portion
   of the energy used in data centers is for cooling purposes. Hence, it is
   one of the important areas of optimization to be addressed to create
   more efficient data centers. Amongst the many ways to increase data
   center efficiencies, airflow management is a key solution to many
   existing data centers. Fundamentally, there are three main schemes:
   hot-aisle containment, cold-aisle containment and exhaust chimney
   containment. This paper's focus is to experimentally characterize the
   following cold aisle configurations: open aisle, partially contained
   aisle and fully contained aisles. Experimental data presented to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the different configurations are rack
   inlet contour plots, tile and rack flow rates, pressure measurements,
   and server CPU temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitor electrodes have been the focus of a

   further functionalized with substances such as conducting polymers,
   metallophthalocyanines, or metal oxides (including oxides of ruthenium,
   manganese, nickel, and zinc) that add a faradaic (charge transfer)
   component to the capacitor known as pseudocapacitance. With relatively
   little pseudocapacitive material, the performance characteristics of the
   electrode can be improved dramatically. This review details the various

Abstract = {{Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has developed into a primary
   investigation tool for the non-destructive evaluation of reinforced
   concrete bridge deck. The collected GPR signals are generally composed
   of direct wave, rebar reflections, bottom reflection and noise. Before
   making GPR-based predictions, rebar reflections need to be extracted
   first. One obstacle is that the first rebar layer is in the shallow
   subsurface in some cases and the target signals may be overlapped with
   the direct waves. Another problem associated is that the testing
   surfaces may be rough in real field testing environments, which lead to
   strong uneven direct waves in the collected signals. This kind of direct
   wave cannot be removed by the commonly adopted average removing method.
   In this paper, Matching pursuits equipped with a customized dictionary
   are applied to deal with the above mentioned two problems. The
   dictionary is built based on the excitation function and the
   electromagnetic scattering mechanisms. Compared to the commonly used
   Gabor dictionary, the proposed dictionary is more adapted to the GPR
   wavefronts and each target signal can be reconstructed by just one atom.
   In addition, there is no need for a reference signal that is not always
   available. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by
   simulation data in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a slotted patch antenna is employed as a wireless sensor
   for monitoring structural strain and fatigue crack. Using antenna
   miniaturization techniques to increase the current path length, the
   footprint of the slotted patch antenna can be reduced to one quarter of
   a previously presented folded patch antenna. Electromagnetic simulations
   show that the antenna resonance frequency varies when the antenna is
   under strain. The resonance frequency variation can be wirelessly
   interrogated and recorded by a radiofrequency identification (RFID)
   reader, and can be used to derive strain/deformation. The slotted patch
   antenna sensor is entirely passive (battery-free), by exploiting an
   inexpensive off-the-shelf RFID chip that receives power from the
   wireless interrogation by the reader.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular beacons are oligonucleotide (DNA or RNA) probes that have
   become increasingly important tools for RNA sensitive detection both in
   vitro and in living cells. From their inception, molecular beacons have
   been used to determine the expression levels of RNA transcripts, but
   they also have the specificity to identify splice variants and
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Our group has performed extensive
   studies on molecular beacon design, molecular beacon hybridization
   assays, and cellular imaging of mRNA molecules. Compared to other
   methods for assessing RNA transcript expression, such as qRT-PCR, the
   beacon-based approach is potentially simpler, faster, more cost
   effective, and more specific.
   Recently, our group demonstrated that molecular beacons can readily
   distinguish mature-and precursor microRNAs, and reliably quantify
   microRNA expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short (19-25 nt),
   single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that regulate an array of cellular
   functions through the degradation and translational repression of mRNA
   targets. Importantly, tissue levels of specific miRNAs have been shown
   to correlate with pathological development of diseases. Thus, a rapid
   and efficient method of assessing miRNA expression is useful for
   diagnosing diseases and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Here, we
   describe the methods for designing and using molecular beacons to detect
   and quantify miRNA.}},

   concentrations are on the order of 10(20) cm(-3). Near-field coupling
   occurs between neighboring doped segments and the observed trends agree

Abstract = {{The MapReduce programming model, along with its open-source
   implementation - Hadoop - has provided a cost effective solution for
   many data-intensive applications. Hadoop stores data distributively and
   exploits data locality by assigning tasks to where data is stored. Many
   data-intensive applications, however, require two (or more) input data
   for each of their tasks. Such applications pose significant challenges
   for Hadoop as the inputs to one task often reside on multiple nodes, and
   Hadoop is unable to discover data locality in this scenario. This often
   leads to excessive data transfers and significant degradations in
   application performance. In this paper, we present Bi-Hadoop, an
   efficient extension of Hadoop to better support binary-input
   applications. Bi-Hadoop integrates an easy-to-use user interface, a
   binary-input aware task scheduler, and a caching subsystem. Extensive
   experiments show that Bi-Hadoop can significantly improve the execution
   of binary-input applications by reducing the data transfer overhead, and
   outperforms existing Hadoop by up to 3.3x.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, GPU has evolved rapidly and exhibited great potential
   in accelerating scientific applications. Massive GPU-assisted HPC
   systems have been deployed. However, as a heterogeneous system,
   GPU-assisted HPC is harder to be programmed and utilized than
   conventional CPU-only system. Statistics of the Keeneland system
   indicate that the effective utilization rate of computational resources
   is only about 40\% when the system runs in normal condition with enough
   jobs in its queue. Our theoretical model shows that the lack of overlap
   between CPU/GPU computation is a major obstacle in the efficient
   utilization of heterogeneous system. In this paper, we evaluate the
   possibility of collocating CPU-only job with GPU-assisted job on the
   same node to increase overlap between CPU/GPU computation, thus
   achieving better utilization. Several performance compromising factors,
   such as resource isolation, CPU load, and GPU memory demands, are
   studied based on workload from popular MPI/CUDA benchmarks. The results
   indicate that, when those factors are managed properly, the collocated
   CPU-only job can efficiently scavenge the underutilized CPU resource
   without affecting the performance of both collocated jobs. Based on this
   insight, an experimental system with collocation-aware job scheduler and
   resource manager is proposed. With our experiment workload pool of mixed
   CPU and GPU jobs, the system demonstrates 15\% gain in throughput and
   10\% gain in both CPU and GPU utilization.}},

Abstract = {{DRAM cells rely on periodic refresh operations to maintain data
   integrity. As the capacity of DRAM memories has increased, so has the
   amount of time consumed in doing refresh. Refresh operations contend
   with read operations, which increases read latency and reduces system
   performance. We show that eliminating latency penalty due to refresh can
   improve average performance by 7.2\%. However, simply doing intelligent
   scheduling of refresh operations is ineffective at obtaining significant
   performance improvement.
   This paper provides an alternative and scalable option to reduce the
   latency penalty due to refresh. It exploits the property that each
   refresh operation in a typical DRAM device internally refreshes multiple
   DRAM rows in JEDEC-based distributed refresh mode. Therefore, a refresh
   operation has well defined points at which it can potentially be Paused
   to service a pending read request. Leveraging this property, we propose
   Refresh Pausing, a solution that is highly effective at alleviating the
   contention from refresh operations. It provides an average performance
   improvement of 5.1\% for 8Gb devices, and becomes even more effective
   for future high-density technologies. We also show that Refresh Pausing
   significantly out-performs the recently proposed Elastic Refresh scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Signal and power integrity are crucial for ensuring good performance in
   high speed digital systems. As the operating frequency of digital
   systems increases, the power and ground bounce created by simultaneous
   switching noise (SSN) becomes a limiting factor for the performance of
   these devices. SSN is caused by parasitic inductance that exists in the
   power delivery network (PDN), and voltage fluctuations on the power and
   ground rails can lead to reduced noise margins and can limit the maximum
   frequency of a digital device. A new PDN design has been suggested that
   achieves significantly reduced SSN {[}1] by replacing the power plane
   structure with a power transmission line (PTL). Previous works have
   demonstrated the validity of the Power Transmission Line concept in
   terms of SSN reduction and power consumption reduction {[}1-4]. However,
   these works focused on small systems with just a few bits. This paper
   shows the effectiveness of the PTL concept on a large scale system with
   a large number of I/O pins through an FPGA implementation to simulate
   the memory interface such as DDR3.}},
