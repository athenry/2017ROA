Abstract = {{Tool-rock interaction processes can be classified as indentation or
   cutting depending on the direction of motion of the tool with respect to
   the rock surface. The modes of failure induced in the rock by an
   indenting or a cutting tool can be ductile and/or brittle. The ductile
   mode is associated with the development of a damage zone, whereas the
   brittle mode involves the growth of macrocracks. This is the first part
   of a series of two papers concerned with an analysis of the cutting and
   the indentation processes based on using the discrete element method. In
   this paper, numerical simulations of the cutting process are conducted
   to reproduce the transition from a ductile to a brittle failure mode
   with increasing depth of cut, which is observed in experiments. The
   numerical results provide evidence that the critical depth of cut d({*})
   controlling the failure mode transition is related to the characteristic
   length =(K-Ic/sigma(c))(2) with K-Ic denoting the material toughness and
   sigma(c) its unconfined compressive strength. The nature of frictional
   contact between the cutter face and the rock in the ductile failure mode
   is also examined. It is shown that the inclination of the total cutting
   force is controlled by a multi-directional flow mechanism ahead of the
   cutter that is related to the formation of a wedge of failed material,
   intermittently adhering to the cutter. As a result, the inclination of
   the total cutting force varies with the rake angle of the cutter and
   cannot be considered an intrinsic measure of the interfacial friction
   between the cutter and the rock. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The failure mechanisms induced by a wedge-shaped tool indenting normally
   against a rock surface are investigated using the discrete element
   method (DEM). The main focus of this study is to explore the conditions
   controlling the transition from a ductile to a brittle mode of failure.
   The development of a damage zone and the initiation and propagation of a
   brittle fracture is well captured by the DEM simulations. The numerical
   results support the conjecture that initiation of brittle fractures is
   governed by a scaled flaw length, a ratio between the flaw size lambda
   and the characteristic length l = (K-Ic/sigma(c))(2) (where K-Ic is the
   toughness and sigma(c) the uniaxial compressive strength). The size of
   the damage zone agrees well with analytical predictions based on the
   cavity expansion model. The effects of a far-field confining stress and
   the existence of a relief surface near the indenter are also examined.

Abstract = {{The salmon farming production chain is structured in four consecutive
   phases: freshwater, seawater, plant processing, and distribution and
   marketing. The phases interact in a pull manner, freshwater stocks fish
   to meet seawater's demand, seawater produces to meet plant processing
   biomass demand, and the processing plant produces to satisfy consumers'
   demand. Freshwater planning decisions are in regard to which freshwater
   center the fish should be located depending on the state of development
   of the fish. The goal is to satisfy seawater's demand while minimizing
   costs. In the seawater phase, the fish are first placed in seawater
   centers, and then sent to the processing plant as they approach suitable
   harvest conditions. The goal of seawater is to maximize harvested
   biomass while satisfying processing plant's demand. This paper presents
   two mixed-integer linear programming modelsone for the freshwater phase
   and another for the seawater phase. These models are designed in such a
   way that the production planning is well integrated and more efficient
   and incorporates the requirements of the farm operator's freshwater and
   seawater units (biological, economic, and health-related constraints)
   ensuring that production in both phases is better coordinated. The
   development of the two models was based on the farming operations of one
   of the main producer farms in Chile. Preliminary evaluations of the
   models indicate that they not only succeed in enforcing constraints that
   are difficult to be met by manual planning but also led to more
   effective results in terms of the objectives set out.}},

Abstract = {{Existing studies tend to agree that there are links between owners'
   capabilities and project performance. However, limited research has
   systematically addressed the relationships among the multiple facets of
   organizational capabilities and project performance. This paper
   quantitatively investigated the relationships among them by developing
   and testing a capability model. With support of data collected from the
   hydropower project industry in China, this study has revealed strong
   correlations between owners' capabilities and project performances,
   confirming owners' capabilities on obtaining scarce and valued
   resources, interorganizational linking, information management, and
   integrating and managing resources can have significant impacts on
   hydropower project performances. It is concluded that these owners'
   capabilities are not only important to improve project performances on
   quality, time, cost, and safety by maximizing the effectiveness of each
   participant's resources, but also critical to appropriately deal with
   hydropower projects' externalities for achieving the objectives on
   project migration, and ecological and environmental impacts. Future
   studies should be conducted to understand how owners can correctly
   perceive the properties of external environments for obtaining
   resources, and to successfully integrate and manage reciprocally
   interdependent project delivery processes at both intra- and
   interorganizational levels to achieve superior project performance.}},

Abstract = {{Acupuncture, which is recognized as an alternative and complementary
   treatment in Western medicine, has long shown efficiencies in chronic
   pain relief, drug addiction treatment, stroke rehabilitation and other
   clinical practices. The neural mechanism underlying acupuncture,
   however, is still unclear. Many studies have focused on the sustained
   effects of acupuncture on healthy subjects, yet there are very few on
   the topological organization of functional networks in the whole brain
   in response to long-duration acupuncture (longer than 20 min). This
   paper presents a novel study on the effects of long-duration
   transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on the small-world
   properties of brain functional networks. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging was used to construct brain functional networks of 18 healthy
   subjects (9 males and 9 females) during the resting state. All subjects
   received both TEAS and minimal TEAS (MTEAS) and were scanned before and
   after each stimulation. An altered functional network was found with
   lower local efficiency and no significant change in global efficiency
   for healthy subjects after TEAS, while no significant difference was
   observed after MTEAS. The experiments also showed that the nodal
   efficiencies in several paralimbic/limbic regions were altered by TEAS,
   and those in middle frontal gyrus and other regions by MTEAS. To remove
   the psychological effects and the baseline, we compared the difference
   between diffTEAS (difference between after and before TEAS) and
   diffMTEAS (difference between after and before MTEAS). The results
   showed that the local efficiency was decreased and that the nodal
   efficiencies in frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate
   gyrus and hippocampus gyrus were changed. Based on those observations,
   we conclude that long-duration TEAS may modulate the short-range
   connections of brain functional networks and also the limbic system. (c)

Abstract = {{Objective: In an effort to improve compliance with insulin therapy and
   to accelerate insulin pharmacokinetics, we tested the hypothesis that
   intradermal insulin delivery using a hollow microneedle causes less pain
   and leads to faster onset and offset of insulin pharmacokinetics in
   children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared with a
   subcutaneous, insulin pump catheter.
   Research design and methods: In this repeated measures study, 16
   children and adolescents with T1DM received Lispro insulin by
   microneedle and subcutaneous administration on separate days. Subjects
   rated the pain of insertion and infusion using a visual analog scale.
   Blood specimens were collected over 4h to determine insulin and glucose
   concentrations.
   Results: Microneedle insertion pain was significantly lower compared
   with insertion of the subcutaneous catheter (p=0.005). Insulin onset
   time was 22min faster (p=0.0004) and offset time was 34min faster
   (p=0.017) after hollow microneedle delivery compared with subcutaneous
   delivery.
   Conclusions: In this study, intradermal insulin delivery using a single,
   hollow microneedle device resulted in less insertion pain and faster
   insulin onset and offset in children and adolescents with T1DM. A
   reduction in pain might improve compliance with insulin delivery. The
   faster onset and offset times of insulin action may enable closed-loop
   insulin therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The Yasutomi temperature-pressure-viscosity correlation is attractive
   for elastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis because it does not require
   an equation of state for the liquid. However, the original Yasutomi
   correlation suffers from the appearance of a zero in the function
   describing the pressure dependence of the relative free volume thermal
   expansivity. When the original correlation is employed, a liquid with a
   high inflection pressure lacks the inflection in the predicted
   pressure-viscosity behavior and a liquid with a low inflection pressure
   is predicted to have two inflections. A new function removes these
   concerns and provides improved precision without the need for an
   equation of state. The improved function gives a more faithful
   representation of viscosity at even low pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a Markovian system of two stations in tandem with finite
   intermediate buffer and two servers. The servers are heterogeneous,
   flexible, and more efficient when they work on their own than when they
   collaborate. We determine how the servers should be assigned dynamically
   to the stations with the goal of maximizing the system throughput. We
   show that the optimal policy depends on whether or not one server is
   dominant (i.e., faster at both stations) and on the magnitude of the
   efficiency loss of collaborating servers. In particular, if one server
   is dominant then he must divide his time between the two stations, and
   we identify the threshold policy the dominant server should use;
   otherwise each server should focus on the station where he is the faster
   server. In all cases, servers only collaborate to avoid idleness when
   the first station is blocked or the second station is starved, and we
   determine when collaboration is preferable to idleness as a function of
   the efficiency loss of collaborating servers.}},

Abstract = {{There are a limited number of therapies available to prevent heart
   failure following myocardial infarction. One novel therapy that is
   currently being pursued is the implantation of cardiac progenitor cells
   (CPCs); however, their responses to oxidative stress during
   differentiation have yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study
   was to determine the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment on CPC
   differentiation in vitro, as well as the effect of H2O2 preconditioning
   before implantation following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. CPCs
   were isolated and cloned from adult rat hearts, and then cultured in the
   absence or presence of H2O2 for 2 or 5 days. CPC survival was assessed
   with Annexin V, and cellular differentiation was evaluated through mRNA
   expression for cardiogenic genes. We found that 100 mu M H2O2 decreased
   serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis by at least 45\% following both 2 and
   5 days of treatment. Moreover, 100 mM H2O2 treatment for 2 days
   significantly increased endothelial and smooth muscle markers compared
   to time-matched untreated CPCs. However, continued H2O2 treatment
   significantly decreased these markers. Left ventricular cardiac function
   was assessed 28 days after I/R and I/R with the implantation of
   Luciferase/GFP(+) CPCs, which were preconditioned with 100 mM H2O2 for 2
   days. Hearts implanted with Luciferase/GFP(+) CPCs had significant
   improvement in both positive and negative dP/dT over I/R. Furthermore,
   cardiac fibrosis was significantly decreased in the preconditioned cells
   versus both I/R alone and I/R with control cells. We also observed a
   significant increase in endothelial cell density in the preconditioned
   CPC hearts compared to untreated CPC hearts, which also coincided with a
   higher density of Luciferase(+) vessels. These findings suggest that
   preconditioning of CPCs with H2O2 for 2 days stimulates neoangiogenesis
   in the peri-infarct area following I/R injury and could be a viable
   therapeutic option to prevent heart failure.}},

Abstract = {{The response matrix, as metal oxide nanostructure decorated n-type
   semiconductor interfaces are modified in situ through direct amination
   and through treatment with organic sulfides and thiols, is demonstrated.
   Nanostructured TiO2, SnOx, NiO and CuxO (x = 1,2), in order of
   decreasing Lewis acidity, are deposited to a porous silicon interface to
   direct a dominant electron transduction process for reversible chemical
   sensing in the absence of significant chemical bond formation. The metal
   oxide sensing sites can be modified to decrease their Lewis acidity in a
   process appearing to substitute nitrogen or sulfur, providing a weak
   interaction to form the oxynitrides and oxysulfides. Treatment with
   triethylamine and diethyl sulfide decreases the Lewis acidity of the
   metal oxide sites. Treatment with acidic ethane thiol modifies the
   sensor response in an opposite sense, suggesting that there are thiol
   (SH) groups present on the surface that provide a Bronsted acidity to
   the surface. The in situ modification of the metal oxides deposited to
   the interface changes the reversible interaction with the analytes, NH3
   and NO. The observed change for either the more basic oxynitrides or
   oxysulfides or the apparent Bronsted acid sites produced from the
   interaction of the thiols do not represent a simple increase in surface
   basicity or acidity, but appear to involve a change in molecular
   electronic structure, which is well explained using the recently
   developed inverse hard and soft acids and bases (IHSAB) model.}},

Abstract = {{Existing fast marching methods solve the Eikonal equation using a
   continuous (first-order) model to estimate the accumulated cost, but a
   discontinuous (zero-order) model for the traveling cost at each grid
   point. As a result the estimate of the accumulated cost (calculated
   numerically) at a given point will vary based on the direction of the
   arriving front, introducing an anisotropy into the discrete algorithm
   even though the continuous partial differential equation (PDE) is itself
   isotropic. To remove this anisotropy, we propose two very different
   schemes. In the first model, we utilize a continuous interpolation of
   the traveling cost, which is not biased by the direction of the
   propagating front. In the second model, we upsample the traveling cost
   on a higher resolution grid to overcome the directional bias. We show
   the significance of removing the directional bias in the computation of
   the cost in some applications of the fast marching method, demonstrating
   that both methods make the discrete implementation more isotropic, in
   accordance with the underlying continuous PDE.}},

Abstract = {{We present a surface stacking fault (SSF) energy approach to predicting
   defect nucleation from the surfaces of surface-dominated nanostructure
   such as FCC metal nanowires. The approach leads to a criterion that
   predicts the initial yield mechanism via either slip or twinning
   depending on whether the unstable twinning energy or unstable slip
   energy is smaller as determined from the resulting SSF energy curve. The
   approach is validated through a comparison between the SSF energy
   calculation and low-temperature classical molecular dynamics simulations
   of copper nanowires with different axial and transverse surface
   orientations, and cross sectional geometries. We focus on the effects of
   the geometric cross section by studying the transition from slip to
   twinning previously predicted in moving from a square to rectangular
   cross section for < 100 >/\{100\} nanowires, and also for moving from a
   rhombic to truncated rhombic cross sectional geometry for < 110 >
   nanowires. We also provide the important demonstration that the
   criterion is able to predict the correct deformation mechanism when full
   dislocation slip is considered concurrently with partial dislocation
   slip and twinning. This is done in the context of rhombic < 110 >
   aluminum nanowires which do not show a tensile reorientation due to full
   dislocation slip. We show that the SSF energy criterion successfully
   predicts the initial mode of surface-nucleated plasticity at low
   temperature, while also discussing the effects of strain and temperature
   on the applicability of the criterion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An evaluation of different dislocation density-based strength models for
   a theory of micropolar single crystal plasticity is presented through
   detailed comparison with discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of a
   constrained thin film subjected to simple shear. The principal component
   of the evaluation is determining the most appropriate way to incorporate
   scale-dependent strengthening due to geometrically necessary
   dislocations (GNDs) within the model. We find that some models give
   results consistent with the discrete dislocation simulations, yet it is
   shown that models based on a generalized Taylor relation do not.
   Additionally, we briefly discuss the differences between models derived
   from unified (single) and independent (multiple) flow criteria, and
   demonstrate that single criterion models provide comparable predictive
   capability while introducing fewer nonlocal constitutive parameters.

Abstract = {{We propose a new framework for joint multichannel speech source
   separation and acoustic noise reduction. In this framework, we start by
   formulating the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE)-based solution in the
   context of multiple simultaneous speakers and background noise, and
   outline the importance of the estimation of the activities of the
   speakers. The latter is accurately achieved by introducing a latent
   variable that takes possible discrete states for a mixture of speech
   signals plus additive noise. Each state characterizes the dominance of
   one of the signals. We determine the posterior probability of this
   latent variable, and show how it plays a twofold role in the MMSE-based
   speech enhancement. First, it allows the extraction of the second order
   statistics of the noise and each of the speech signals from the noisy
   data. These statistics are needed to formulate the multichannel
   Wiener-based filters (including the minimum variance distortionless
   response). Second, it weighs the outputs of these linear filters to
   shape the spectral contents of the signals' estimates following the
   associated target speakers' activities. We use the spatial and spectral
   cues contained in the multichannel recordings of the sound mixtures to
   compute the posterior probability of this latent variable. The spatial
   cue is acquired by using the normalized observation vector whose
   distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian-mixture-like model,
   while the spectral cue can be captured by using a pre-trained Gaussian
   mixture model for the log-spectra of speech. The parameters of the
   investigated models and the speakers' activities (posterior
   probabilities of the different states of the latent variable) are
   estimated via expectation maximization. Experimental results including
   comparisons with the well-known independent component analysis and
   masking are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrophoricity of nascent and passivated nano-aluminum particles in air
   is studied theoretically using energy balance analyses. The work
   incorporates size-dependence of physicochemical properties of particles
   at nano-scales, and considers free-molecular and radiation heat exchange
   with the surrounding environment. The heterogeneous oxidation process is
   modeled using the Mott-Cabrera mechanism. Nascent aluminum particles
   with diameters lower than 32 nm are predicted to be pyrophoric. The
   critical diameter for particles passivated with 0.3-nm thick oxide layer
   is calculated as 3.8 nm. Particles with oxide layers thicker than 0.3 nm
   are found to be non-pyrophoric. The sensitivity analysis suggests that
   the model results are significantly affected by the choice of
   physicochemical properties, polymorphic state of the oxide layer,
   parameters of the Mott-Cabrera oxidation kinetics, and heat-transfer
   correlation. The critical particle size increases by 40\%, when bulk
   material properties calculated at room temperature are used and the
   oxide layer is assumed to be in a crystalline form. It decreases by
   43\%, when free-molecular effects are neglected. (c) 2013 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Data to field operations of construction resources (personnel,
   equipment, materials) is vast but the effort of collecting, analyzing,
   and visualizing is hardly ever taken. One main reason that limits higher
   quality in project site management decision making especially in
   resource intensive and complex operations is access to real-time
   information and subsequent technology that enables effortless data
   collection, processing, and visualization. Although recent developments
   in remote data sensing and intelligent data processing supplement manual
   data recording and analyze practices, few data on visualization tools in
   construction exist that gather data from dynamic resources and stream it
   to a field-realistic virtual reality environment in real-time.
   State-of-the-art technology in the field of real-time data collection
   and visualization is reviewed. A novel framework is presented that
   explains the method of streaming data from real-time positioning sensors
   to a real-time data visualization platform. Three case studies are
   presented which highlight its methods for recording data and visualizing
   information of construction activities in a (1) simulated virtual
   construction site, (2) outdoor construction setting, and (3) worker
   training environment. The results demonstrate that important
   construction information related to both safety and activity in field
   operations can be automatically monitored and visualized in real-time,
   thus offering benefits such as increased situational awareness to
   workers, equipment operators, or decision makers anywhere on a
   construction project or from a remote location. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The future commercialization and application of solid oxide fuel cell
   (SOFC) technologies requires the development of novel anode materials
   with excellent performance and stability at intermediate-temperatures

   or through exploring alternative metal cermet or ceramic based

   effective approaches for both cell fabrication and performance
   optimization. This paper reviews most of the progress reported in the
   literature committed to the fabrication and optimization of SOFC anodes
   by wet impregnation for low temperature and/or hydrocarbon operation.
   The optimization of traditional nickel based anodes by adding excellent
   catalyst, the replacement of nickel by other inert metal or ceramic
   species, and some metal supported designs with impregnated catalyst are
   all presented and discussed, mainly focusing on the cell performance,
   redox and thermal stability, long-term reliability, carbon and sulfur

Abstract = {{Metallic magnetic materials have desirable magnetic properties,
   including high permeability, and high saturation flux density, when
   compared with their ferrite counterparts. However, eddy-current losses
   preclude their use in many switching converter applications, due to the
   challenge of simultaneously achieving sufficiently thin laminations such
   that eddy currents are suppressed (e.g., 500 nm-1 mu m for megahertz
   frequencies), while simultaneously achieving overall core thicknesses
   such that substantial power can be handled. A CMOS-compatible
   fabrication process based on robot-assisted sequential electrodeposition
   followed by selective chemical etching has been developed for the
   realization of a core of substantial overall thickness (tens to hundreds
   of micrometers) comprised of multiple, stacked permalloy (Ni80Fe20)
   nanolaminations. Tests of toroidal inductors with nanolaminated cores
   showed negligible eddy-current loss relative to total core loss even at
   a peak flux density of 0.5 T in the megahertz frequency range. To
   illustrate the use of these cores, a buck power converter topology is
   implemented with switching frequencies of 1-2 MHz. Power conversion
   efficiency greater than 85\% with peak operating flux density of 0.3-0.5
   T in the core and converter output power level exceeding 5 W was
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel ceramic hydrogen electrode material consisting of K2NiF4-type
   structured Pr0.8Sr1.2(Co,Fe)(0.8)Nb0.2O4+delta (K-PSCFN) matrix with

   demonstrated by annealing perovskite Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta
   (P-PSCFN) in H-2 at 900 degrees C. Impedance spectra and voltage current
   density curves of the La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte
   supported solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) with a configuration of
   K-PSCFN CFA/LSGM/Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFN) have been evaluated
   as a function of the operating temperature and feeding gas absolute
   humidity (AH) to characterize the cell performance. Cell polarization
   resistances (R-p) were as low as 0.77 and 0.31 Omega cm(2) under open
   circuit voltage (OCV) and 60\% absolute humidity (AH) at 800 and 900
   degrees C, respectively. The cell has demonstrated good stability for
   high temperature stream electrolysis, and a hydrogen production rate of
   707 ml/cm(2)h calculated from the Faraday's law has been achieved under
   an electrolysis voltage of 1.3 V and 60 vol.\% AH at 900 degrees C. The
   cell performance results indicate that K-PSCFN-CFA is a promising

Abstract = {{The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different
   training types and secondary to test gender differences on the
   training-related cortical plasticity induced by three different
   tongue-training paradigms: (1) therapeutic tongue exercises (TTE), (2)
   playing computer games with the tongue using the Tongue Drive System
   (TDS) and (3) tongue-protrusion task (TPT). Forty-eight participants
   were randomized into three groups with 1 h of TTE, TDS, or TPT.
   Stimulus-response curves of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and motor
   cortex mapping for tongue muscles and first dorsal interosseous (FDI)
   (control) were established using transcranial magnetic stimulation at
   three time-points: (1) before tongue-training, (2) immediately after
   training, (3) 1 h after training. Subject-based reports of motivation,
   fun, pain and fatigue were evaluated on 0-10 numerical rating scales
   after training. The resting motor thresholds of tongue MEPs were lowered
   by training with TDS and TPT (P < 0.011) but not by TTE (P = 0.167).
   Tongue MEP amplitudes increased after training with TDS and TPT (P <
   0.030) but not with TTE (P = 0.302). Men had higher MEPs than women in
   the TDS group (P < 0.045) at all time-points. No significant effect of
   tongue-training on FDI MEPs was observed (P > 0.335). The tongue
   cortical motor map areas were not significantly increased by training (P
   > 0.142). Training with TDS was most motivating and fun (P < 0.001) and
   TTE was rated the most painful (P < 0.001). Fatigue level was not
   different between groups (P > 0.071). These findings suggest a
   differential effect of tongue-training paradigms on training-induced
   cortical plasticity and subject-based scores of fun, motivation and pain
   in healthy participants. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Stability of Supported Amine Adsorbents to SO2 and NOx in Postcombustion
   CO2 Capture. 1. Single-Component Adsorption}},

Abstract = {{Flue gases from coal-fired power plants typically contain not only CO2
   but other acid-gas impurities such as SOx and NOx that can dramatically
   influence the CO2 capture efficiency. Whereas postcombustion CO2 capture
   by aminosilica materials has been extensively studied over the past few
   years because of their high equilibrium CO2 capacities, the performance
   of these materials under realistic conditions (in the presence of SOx,
   NOx, and O-2) remains relatively unexplored. In this study, the degree
   of irreversible binding of SO2, NO, and NO2 to four supported amine
   adsorbents is evaluated to assess the SO2, NO, and NO2 adsorption
   capacities of aminosilica sorbents and their effects on the CO2
   adsorption capacities. Adsorbents constructed using poly(ethyleneimine)
   and three different silane coupling agents (based on
   propyltrimethoxysilane linkers) with primary, secondary, and tertiary
   amines are evaluated. Under the experimental conditions used in this
   investigation, it is found that primary amines with high amine loadings
   displayed more affinity toward NO than their secondary and tertiary
   amine counterparts. However, overall, NO adsorption on the aminosilica
   adsorbents is low, and therefore, the CO2 capacities of the adsorbent
   materials exposed to NO remained almost unchanged after the exposure. In
   contrast, all materials showed a very high nitrogen dioxide adsorption
   capacity upon exposure to NO2. As a result, all adsorbents treated with
   NO2 exhibited a dramatic reduction in CO2 capacity, which corresponds to
   the deactivation of amine groups due to the irreversible binding of NO2.
   In addition, our results indicate that SO2 adsorbed significantly on
   supported amine adsorbents, resulting in a dramatic loss in CO2 capacity
   during CO2 capture from flue gas. With similar amine loadings, although
   secondary amines exhibited higher affinity to SO2, their CO2 capacity
   loss after exposure to SO2 is lower than that of primary amines,
   indicating that these materials are more stable in the presence of SO2,
   which implies that more SO2 desorbs from secondary amines during the
   desorption step. These results suggest that for silica-supported amine
   materials to be useful in practical CO2 capture applications, it is
   necessary to significantly reduce the SO2 and NO2 concentrations of the
   flue gas prior to the CO2 capture process. On the other hand, the
   capture efficiency of these materials does not change significantly in
   the presence of NO. This suggests that such materials might be promising
   for postcombustion CO2 capture from flue gas streams derived from
   natural gas combustion, as these streams typically contain reduced SO2
   concentrations but can still have significant NOx concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The optical constants of tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) are determined in a
   broad spectral region from the visible to the far infrared. Ta2O5 films
   of various thicknesses from approximately 170 to 1600 nm are deposited
   using reactive magnetron sputtering on Si substrates. X-ray diffraction
   shows that the as-deposited films are amorphous, and annealing in air at
   800 degrees C results in the formation of nanocrystalline Ta2O5.
   Ellipsometry is used to obtain the dispersion in the visible and
   near-infrared. Two Fourier-transform infrared spectrometers are used to
   measure the transmittance and reflectance at wavelengths from 1 to 1000
   mu m. The surface topography and microstructure of the samples are
   examined using atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, and
   scanning electron microscopy. Classical Lorentz oscillators are employed
   to model the absorption bands due to phonons and impurities. A simple
   model is introduced to account for light scattering in the annealed
   films, which contain micro-cracks. For the unannealed samples, an
   effective-medium approximation is used to take into account the adsorbed
   moisture in the film and a Drude free-electron term is also added to
   model the broad background absorption. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Organic aerosols (OA) in Pasadena are characterized using multiple
   measurements from the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality
   and Climate Change (CalNex) campaign. Five OA components are identified
   using positive matrix factorization including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA)
   and two types of oxygenated OA (OOA). The Pasadena OA elemental
   composition when plotted as H:C versus O:C follows a line less steep
   than that observed for Riverside, CA. The OOA components from both
   locations follow a common line, however, indicating similar secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA) oxidation chemistry at the two sites such as
   fragmentation reactions leading to acid formation. In addition to the
   similar evolution of elemental composition, the dependence of SOA
   concentration on photochemical age displays quantitatively the same
   trends across several North American urban sites. First, the OA/CO
   values for Pasadena increase with photochemical age exhibiting a slope
   identical to or slightly higher than those for Mexico City and the
   northeastern United States. Second, the ratios of OOA to odd-oxygen (a
   photochemical oxidation marker) for Pasadena, Mexico City, and Riverside
   are similar, suggesting a proportional relationship between SOA and
   odd-oxygen formation rates. Weekly cycles of the OA components are
   examined as well. HOA exhibits lower concentrations on Sundays versus
   weekdays, and the decrease in HOA matches that predicted for primary
   vehicle emissions using fuel sales data, traffic counts, and vehicle
   emission ratios. OOA does not display a weekly cycleafter accounting for
   differences in photochemical aging which suggests the dominance of
   gasoline emissions in SOA formation under the assumption that most urban
   SOA precursors are from motor vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to develop a nanoparticle synthesis
   scheme that controls nanoparticle shape and surface chemistry
   concomitantly. Specifically, a method to synthesize hydroxyapatite
   nanoparticles using. a dispersed block copolymer template is explored,
   which produces spherical and needle-shaped nanoparticles, and at the end
   of the synthesis, the block copolymer is retained as a surface coating
   on the nanoparticles. This strategy has been used previously with
   double-hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBCs) as. the dispersed template;
   however, in this. work, an alternative block copolymer chemistry is
   explored in an effort to extend this method synthesis in organic
   solvents, producing nanoparticles that are organophilic instead of
   hydrophilic. The hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were synthesized using
   poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(methacrylic acid) (PMMA-b-PMAA) PMAA)
   as the dispersed template and tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. The
   synthesis proceeds following the ionization of the PMAA block of the
   copolymer and association between. this ionized group and the calcium
   precursor ions. To investigate the degree of shape control available,
   the concentration of block copolymer solution and the amount of
   precursor were systematically varied, and the synthesized HAp
   nanoparticles were characterized. SEM images, showed that needle and
   spherical nanoparticles could be synthesized by changing the block
   copolymer concentration. TGA, FT-IR, and XRD results indicated that the
   block copolymer used for synthesis remained on the HAp particle surface.
   Overall, these results indicate that the shape of the nanoparticles
   produced by this method was related to the Ca2+/COO- mole ratio used
   dung synthesis similar to results obtained with DHBC template synthesis.
   The qualitative agreement between the shape control mechanisms in the
   two synthesis schemes suggests that this relationship could be general
   to the overall synthesis scheme and provide a mechanism for controlling.

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{We present a microfabricated surface-electrode ion trap with a pair of
   integrated waveguides that generate a standing microwave field resonant
   with the Yb-171(+) hyperfine qubit. The waveguides are engineered to
   position the wave antinode near the center of the trap, resulting in
   maximum field amplitude and uniformity along the trap axis. By
   calibrating the relative amplitudes and phases of the waveguide
   currents, we can control the polarization of the microwave field to
   reduce off-resonant coupling to undesired Zeeman sublevels. We
   demonstrate single-qubit pi-rotations as fast as 1 mu s with less than
   6\% variation in Rabi frequency over an 800 mu m microwave interaction
   region. Fully compensating pulse sequences further improve the
   uniformity of X-gates across this interaction region.}},

Title = {{Multifractal Analysis for Nutritional Assessment}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{The concept of multifractality is currently used to describe
   self-similar and complex scaling properties observed in numerous
   biological signals. Fractals are geometric objects or dynamic variations
   which exhibit some degree of similarity (irregularity) to the original
   object in a wide range of scales. This approach determines irregularity
   of biologic signal as an indicator of adaptability, the capability to
   respond to unpredictable stress, and health. In the present work, we
   propose the application of multifractal analysis of wavelet-transformed
   proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectra of plasma to
   determine nutritional insufficiency. For validation of this method on
   H-1 NMR signal of human plasma, standard deviation from classical
   statistical approach and Hurst exponent (H), left slope and partition
   function from multifractal analysis were extracted from H-1 NMR spectra
   to test whether multifractal indices could discriminate healthy subjects
   from unhealthy, intensive care unit patients. After validation, the
   multifractal approach was applied to spectra of plasma from a modified
   crossover study of sulfur amino acid insufficiency and tested for
   associations with blood lipids. The results showed that standard
   deviation and H, but not left slope, were significantly different for
   sulfur amino acid sufficiency and insufficiency. Quadratic discriminant
   analysis of H, left slope and the partition function showed 78\% overall
   classification accuracy according to sulfur amino acid status.
   Triglycerides and apolipoprotein C3 were significantly correlated with a
   multifractal model containing H, left slope, and standard deviation, and
   cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were significantly
   correlated to H. In conclusion, multifractal analysis of H-1 NMR spectra
   provides a new approach to characterize nutritional status.}},

Title = {{Vascular Injury Involves the Overoxidation of Peroxiredoxin Type II and

Abstract = {{Background
   Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx) is inactivated by overoxidation of the
   peroxidatic cysteine residue under oxidative stress. However, the
   significance in the context of vascular disease is unknown.
   Methods and Results
   Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that 2-Cys Prxs, particularly Prx
   type II, are heavily overoxidized in balloon-injured rodent carotid
   vessels and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Consistent with this
   observation, the selective depletion of Prx II exacerbated neointimal
   hyperplasia in injured carotid vessels. We also found that the
   epipolythiodioxopiperazine class of fungal metabolites exhibited an
   enzyme-like activity mimicking 2-Cys Prx peroxidase and manifestly
   eliminated the intracellular H2O2 in the vascular cells. Functionally,
   the epipolythiodioxopiperazines reciprocally regulated the
   platelet-derived growth factor receptor-- and vascular endothelial
   growth factor receptor-mediated signaling in these vascular cells by
   replacing Prx II. As a consequence, the epipolythiodioxopiperazines
   inhibited the proliferative and migratory activities of smooth muscle
   cells but promoted those of endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover,
   administration of the epipolythiodioxopiperazines to the injured carotid
   vessels resulted in a successful recovery by inhibiting neointimal
   hyperplasia without causing cytotoxicity and simultaneously inducing
   reendothelialization.
   Conclusions
   This study reveals for the first time the involvement of the 2-Cys Prx
   overoxidation and thus the therapeutic use of their activity mimetic in
   vascular injuries like stenting.}},

   Many different silica nanomaterials such as Stober silica nanospheres,
   mesoporous silica nanoparticles, and hollow silica nanotubes have been
   coated with a high density layer of water-dispersible magnetite
   nanoparticles. The size and attachment efficiency of the magnetite
   nanopartide can be well tuned by adjusting the precursor concentration
   and reflux time. The functionalization of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles with
   dye molecules and biocompatible polymers impart optical imaging modality
   and good colloidal stability in either buffer solution or serum. The
   functionalized materials also exhibited strong potential as negative
   contrast agents in T-2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelial cells play significant roles in conditioning tissues after
   injury by the production and secretion of angiocrine factors. At least
   two distinct subsets of monocytes, CD45(+)CD11b(+)Gr1(+)Ly6C(+)
   inflammatory and CD45(+)CD11b(+)Gr1(-)Ly6C(-) anti-inflammatory
   monocytes, respond differentially to these angiocrine factors and
   promote pathogen/debris clearance and arteriogenesis/tissue
   regeneration, respectively. We demonstrate here that local sphingosine
   1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1P(3)) agonism recruits anti-inflammatory
   monocytes to remodeling vessels. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) thin
   films were used to deliver FTY720, an S1P(1/3) agonist, to inflamed and
   ischemic tissues, which resulted in a reduction in proinflammatory
   cytokine secretion and an increase in regenerative cytokine secretion.
   The altered balance of cytokine secretion results in preferential
   recruitment of anti-inflammatory monocytes from circulation. The
   chemotaxis of these cells, which expressmore S1P(3) than inflammatory
   monocytes, toward SDF-1 alpha was also enhanced with FTY720 treatment,
   but not in S1P(3) knockout cells. FTY720 delivery enhanced arteriolar
   diameter expansion and increased length density of the local
   vasculature. This work establishes a role for S1P receptor signaling in
   the local conditioning of tissues by angiocrine factors that
   preferentially recruit regenerative monocytes that can enhance healing
   outcomes, tissue regeneration, and biomaterial implant functionality.}},

   Applications}},

Abstract = {{Palladium is a marvelous catalyst for a rich variety of reactions in
   industrial processes U and commercial devices. Most Pd-catalyzed
   reactions exhibit structure sensitivity, meaning that the activity or
   selectivity depends on the arrangement of atoms on the surface.
   Previously, such reactions could only be studied in ultrahigh vacuum
   using Pd single crystals cut with a specific crystallographic plane.
   However, these model catalysts are far different from real catalytic
   systems owing to the absence of atoms at corners and edges and the
   extremely small specific surface areas for the model systems. Indeed,
   enhancing the performance of a Pd-based catalyst, in part to reduce the
   amount needed of this precious and rare metal for a given reaction,
   requires the use of Pd with the highest possible specific surface area.
   Recent advances in nanocrystal synthesis are offering a great
   opportunity to investigate and quantify the structural sensitivity of
   catalysts based on Pd and other metals. For a structure-sensitive
   reaction, the catalytic properties of Pd nanocrystals are strongly
   dependent on both the size and shape. The shape plays a more significant
   role in controlling activity and selectivity, because the shape controls
   not only the facets but also the proportions of surface atoms at
   corners, edges, and plants, which affect the outcomes of possible
   reactions. We expect catalysts based on Pd nanocrystals with optimized
   shapes to meet the increasing demands of industrial applications at
   reduced loadings and costs.
   In this Account, we discuss recent advances in the synthesis of Pd
   nanocrystals with controlled shapes and their resulting performance as
   catalysts for a large number of reactions. First, we review various
   synthetic strategies based on oxidative etching, surface capping, and
   kinetic control that have been used to direct the shapes of
   nanocrystals. When crystal growth is under thermodynamic control, the
   capping agent plays a pivotal role in determining the shape of a product
   by altering the order of surface energies for different facets through
   selective adsorption; the resulting product has the lowest possible
   total surface energy. In contrast, the product of a kinetically
   controlled synthesis often deviates from the thermodynamically favored
   structure, with notable examples including nanocrystals endosed by
   high-index facets or concave surfaces.
   We then discuss the key parameters that control the nucleation and
   growth of Pd nanocrystals to decipher potential growth mechanisms and
   build a connection between the experimental conditions and the pathways
   to different shapes. Finally, we present a number of examples to
   highlight the use of these Pd nanocrystals as catalysts or
   electrocatalysts for various applications with structure-sensitive
   properties. We believe that a deep understanding of the shape-dependent
   catalytic properties, together with an ability to experimentally
   maneuver the shape of metal nanocrystals, will eventually lead to
   rational design of advanced catalysts with substantially enhanced
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The interphase layer in semi-crystalline polyethylene is the least known
   constituent, compared to the amorphous and crystalline phases, in terms
   of mechanical properties. In this study, the Monte Carlo molecular
   simulation results for the interlamellar domain (i.e. amorphous+
   interphases), reported in (Macromolecules 2006, 39, 439-447) are
   employed. The amorphous elastic properties are adopted from the
   literature and then two distinct micromechanical homogenization
   approaches are utilized to dissociate the interphase stiffness from that
   of the interlamellar region. The results of the two micromechanical
   approaches match perfectly. Interestingly, the dissociated interphase
   stiffness lacks the common feature of positive definiteness, which is
   attributed to its nature as a transitional domain between two coexisting
   phases. The sensitivity analyses reveal that this property is
   insensitive to the non-orthotropic components of the interlamellar
   stiffness and the uncertainties existing in the interlamellar and
   amorphous stiffnesses. Finally, using the dissociated interphase
   stiffness, its effective Young's modulus is calculated, which compares
   well with the effective interlamellar Young's modulus for highly
   crystalline polyethylene, reported in an experimental study. This
   satisfactory agreement along with the identical results produced by the
   two micromechanical approaches confirms the validity of the new
   information about the interphase elastic properties in addition to
   making the proposed dissociation methodology quite reliable when applied
   to similar problems. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xFexO5+delta, which has created pore channels that
   dramatically enhance oxygen ion diffusion and surface oxygen exchange

Abstract = {{Peridynamics has gained significant attention as an alternative
   formulation for problems in solid mechanics. Recent contributions have
   included initial attempts to include material damage and failure. In
   this paper, we propose an approach to incorporate classical continuum
   damage models in the state-based theory of peridynamics. This has the
   advantage of enabling the description of the damage evolution process in
   peridynamics according to well-established models. The approach is based
   on modifying the peridynamic influence function according to the state
   of accumulated damage. As a result, peridynamic bonds between nonlocal
   material points are severed in accordance with the damage law. The
   peridynamic damage formulation proposed is implemented for the
   particular case of a well established ductile damage model for metals.
   The model is applied to the simulation of ballistic impact of extruded
   corrugated aluminum panels and compared with experiments. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a geom etric multiscale finite element formulation
   developed for predicting the response of heterogeneous materials and

   the geometry of heterogeneities occurring at sub-elemental length
   scales, and ensure compatibility across the element boundaries. The
   local auxiliary mesh is only used at the elemental level to compute the
   shape functions and does not need to be retained as part of macroscale
   simulations. The formulation of 2D and 3D elements is illustrated
   through examples where error estimates are conducted, and which
   illustrate the effectiveness of the method for the static and dynamic
   analyses of solids with local heterogeneities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Nanoporous layered silicate/polymer composite membranes are of interest
   because they can exploit the high aspect ratio of exfoliated selective
   flakes/layers to enhance molecular sieving and create a highly tortuous
   transport path for the slower molecules. In this work, we combine
   membrane synthesis, detailed microstructural characterization, and mixed
   gas permeation measurements to demonstrate that nanoporous flake/polymer
   membranes allows significant improvement in gas permeability while
   maintaining selectivity. We begin with the primary-amine-intercalated
   porous layered silicate SAMH-3 and show that it can be exfoliated using
   a high shear rate generated by a high-speed mixer. The exfoliated SAMH-3
   flakes were used to form SAMH-3/cellulose acetate (CA) membranes. Their
   microstructure was analyzed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),
   revealing a high degree of exfoliation of AMH-3 layers in the CA
   membrane with a small number of layers (4-8) in the exfoliated flakes.
   TEM analysis visualized the thickness of the flakes as 15-30 nm, and is
   consistent with the SAXS analysis. The CO2/CH4 gas separation
   performance of the CA membrane was significantly increased by
   incorporating only 2-6 wt\% of SAMH-3 flakes. There was a large increase
   in CO2 permeability with maintenance of selectivity. This cannot be
   explained by conventional models of transport in flake-containing
   membranes, and indicates complex transport paths in the membrane. It is
   also in contrast to the much higher loadings of isotropic particles
   required for similar enhancements. The present approach may allow
   avoidance of particle aggregation and poor interfacial adhesion
   associated with larger quantities of inorganic fillers. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The cost of dilute ethanol purification is a significant component of
   the overall cost for fuel grade ethanol production through fermentation
   or other biological routes. In this study, we consider bioethanol
   purification to the fuel grade in a closed system of photobioreactors
   (PBRs) that produce a dilute (0.5-5 wt \%) ethanol solution, and where
   the water is recycled back to the reactors after separation. To reduce
   the energy consumption and hence the cost of dilute ethanol
   purification, a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane process is introduced as a
   potential pretreatment in order to purify ethanol water mixtures to an
   intermediate concentration. The pretreated mixture is separated across
   the azeotropic point to the fuel grade by a hybrid
   distillation-membrane-pervaporation (D-PV) process. A superstructure of
   the overall separation process is formulated in the General Algebraic
   Modeling System (GAMS) environment as a mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming (MINLP) problem and optimized to minimize the total
   separation cost. The problem is posed with a constraint on the minimum
   ethanol recovery by the overall system. For dilute feeds, the steam used
   in the distillation reboiler dominates both the energy and the cost of
   the overall system. Installing the RO system reduces the steam usage at
   the expense of larger capital investment in membrane modules, which has
   been found to be optimal for dilute feeds below 3 wt \% ethanol. The
   optimal number of membrane stages and the feed location of individual RO
   modules change at different feed concentrations and ethanol recoveries.
   The optimal process design results in a higher ethanol recovery by the
   main hybrid separation unit compared to the RO membrane process due to
   the high capital cost of an RO system to achieve a high recovery.
   Developing a cheaper RO membrane may further reduce the separation cost
   and may expand an optimal dilute feed concentration range.}},

Abstract = {{We report magnetic alignment of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets

   properties of hBN, the epoxy composite with aligned hBN platelets shows
   interesting properties along the alignment direction, including
   significantly reduced coefficient of thermal expansion, reaching similar
   to 28.7 ppm/degrees C, and enhanced thermal conductivity, 104\% higher
   than that of unaligned counterpart, both of which are observed at a low
   filler loading of 20 wt \%. Our modeling suggests the filler alignment
   is the major reason for these intriguing material properties. Finite

Abstract = {{Palladium octahedra with controlled edge lengths were obtained from Pd
   cubes of a single size. The success of this synthesis relies on a
   transformation involving oxidative etching and regrowth. Because the
   \{100\} side faces of the Pd nanocubes were capped by Br- ions, Pd atoms
   were removed from the corners during oxidative etching, and the
   resultant Pd2+ ions could be reduced and deposited back onto the
   nanocubes, but preferentially on the \{100\} facets. We could control
   the ratio of the etching and regrowth rates (R-etching and R-regrowth)
   simply by varying the amount of HCl added to the reaction solution. With
   a large amount of HCl, etching dominated the process (R-etching >>
   R-regrowth), resulting in the formation of Pd octahedra with an edge
   length equal to 70\% of that of the cubes. In contrast, with a small
   amount of HCl, all of the newly formed Pd2+ ions could be quickly
   reduced and deposited back onto the Pd cubes. In this case, R-etching
   approximate to R-regrowth, and the resultant Pd octahedra had roughly
   the same volume as the starting cubes, together with an edge length
   equal to 130\% of that of the cubes. When the amount of HCl was between
   these two extremes, we obtained Pd octahedra with intermediate edge
   lengths. This work not only advances our understanding of oxidative
   etching in nanocrystal synthesis but also offers a powerful means for
   controlling the shape and size of metal nanocrystals simply by adjusting
   the rates of etching and regrowth.}},

Abstract = {{Propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) polymers are synthesized using an
   oxidative polymerization route that results in methacrylate substituted
   poly(ProDOTs) having a M-n of 10-20 kDa wherein the methacrylate
   functionality constitutes from 6 to 60\% of the total monomer units.
   Solutions of these polymers show excellent film forming abilities, with
   thin films prepared using both spray-casting and spin-coating. These
   polymers are demonstrated to crosslink upon UV irradiation at 350 nm, in
   the presence of an appropriate photoinitiator, to render the films
   insoluble to common organic solvents. Electrochemical,
   spectroelectrochemical, and colorimetric analyses of the crosslinked
   polymer films are performed to establish that they retain the same
   electrochromic qualities as the parent polymers with no detriment to the
   observed properties. To demonstrate applicability for multi-film
   processing and patterning, photolithographic patterning is shown, as is
   desired for fully solution processed and patterned devices.}},

Abstract = {{The role of surface chemistry on the toxicity of Ag nanoparticles is
   investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast as a platform for
   evaluation. Combining the shape-controlled synthesis of Ag nanoparticles
   with a comprehensive characterization of their physicochemical
   properties, an understanding is formed of the correlation between the
   physicochemical parameters of nanoparticles and the inhibition growth of
   yeast cells upon the introduction of nanoparticles into the cell culture
   system. Capping agents, surface facets, and sample stabilitythe three
   experimental parameters that are inherent from the wet-chemical
   synthesis of Ag nanoparticleshave a strong impact on toxicity
   evaluation. Hence, it is important to characterize surface properties of
   Ag nanoparticles in the nature of biological media and to understand the
   role that surface chemistry may interplay to correlate the
   physicochemical properties of nanoparticles with their biological
   response upon exposure. This work demonstrates the great importance of
   surface chemistry in designing experiments for reliable toxicity
   evaluation and in mitigating the toxicity of Ag nanoparticles for their

Abstract = {{In previous work, three evolved Propionibacterium acidipropionici
   mutants with higher tolerant capacity of propionic acid (PA) were
   obtained by genome shuffling. Here, we attempted to unravel the
   acid-tolerant mechanism of P. acidipropionici by comparing the
   physiological changes between P. acidipropionici and three mutants. The
   parameters used for comparison included intracellular pH (pH(i)),
   NAD(+)/NADH ratio, H+-ATPase activity, and the intracellular amino acids
   concentrations. It was indicated that the acid tolerance of P.
   acidipropionici was systematically regulated. Specifically, low pH(i),
   promoted the P. acidipropionici to biosynthesize more H+-ATPase to pump
   the protons out of the cells, and as a result, the NAD+/NADH ratio
   increased due to the decreased protons concentration. The increased
   arginine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid concentrations helped to
   resist the acidic environment by consuming more H. and generating more
   ATP and NH3. Based on what was analyzed above, 20mM arginine and
   aspartic acid were added during the shaker culture of P.
   acidipropionici, and the maximal PA titer reached 14.38 g/L, which was
   increased by 39.9\% compared with the control. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Predicting fluid penetration during slot die coating onto porous
   substrates}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Slot die coating onto porous media is a distinct field in the coating
   industry and has broad applications. One important technical issue
   related to coating porous media is how to predict and control the fluid
   penetration depth, which directly affects the appearance, properties,
   and performance of the resulting material. Up to now, the analytical
   relationship between processing parameters and the final penetration
   depth are still not well understood. Existing modeling work either uses
   oversimplified assumption of pressure distribution in the coating bead,
   or does not provide a simple expression to predict the penetration depth
   and often requires a complex calculation procedure. Furthermore,
   previous models are limited to Newtonian fluids. In this study, new
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and analytical models to study the
   penetration of fluid into porous media during slot die coating were
   developed for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Penetration driven by
   the pressure in coating bead was considered in these models. To this
   end, basic analytical models that can easily and rapidly calculate the
   penetration depth were developed and the results were compared to CFD
   models. It was found that there exists good agreement between the
   analytical and CFD models when coating Newtonian and non-Newtonian
   fluids, having an overall relative error of less than 6\% and ranging
   between 12-26\%, respectively. Results from a parametric study, when
   coating Newtonian fluids, showed that viscosity has a negligible effect
   on the penetration depth; whereas coating speed, flow rate, permeability
   and porosity are more important. Based on the experimental analysis,
   similar trends exist for the measured and predicted values of the
   penetration depth when coating non-Newtonian fluids. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Highly efficient differentiation of neural precursors from human
   embryonic stem cells and benefits of transplantation after ischemic
   stroke in mice}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and
   disability, but treatment options are severely limited. Cell therapy
   offers an attractive strategy for regenerating lost tissues and
   enhancing the endogenous healing process. In this study, we investigated
   the use of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors as a cell
   therapy in a murine stroke model.
   Methods: Neural precursors were derived from human embryonic stem cells
   by using a fully adherent SMAD inhibition protocol employing small
   molecules. The efficiency of neural induction and the ability of these
   cells to further differentiate into neurons were assessed by using
   immunocytochemistry. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was used to
   demonstrate the electrophysiological activity of human embryonic stem
   cell-derived neurons. Neural precursors were transplanted into the core
   and penumbra regions of a focal ischemic stroke in the barrel cortex of
   mice. Animals received injections of bromodeoxyuridine to track
   regeneration. Neural differentiation of the transplanted cells and
   regenerative markers were measured by using immunohistochemistry. The
   adhesive removal test was used to determine functional improvement after
   stroke and intervention.
   Results: After 11 days of neural induction by using the small-molecule
   protocol, over 95\% of human embryonic stem-derived cells expressed at
   least one neural marker. Further in vitro differentiation yielded cells
   that stained for mature neuronal markers and exhibited high-amplitude,
   repetitive action potentials in response to depolarization. Neuronal
   differentiation also occurred after transplantation into the ischemic
   cortex. A greater level of bromodeoxyuridine co-localization with
   neurons was observed in the penumbra region of animals receiving cell
   transplantation. Transplantation also improved sensory recovery in
   transplant animals over that in control animals.
   Conclusions: Human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors derived
   by using a highly efficient small-molecule SMAD inhibition protocol can
   differentiate into electrophysiologically functional neurons in vitro.
   These cells also differentiate into neurons in vivo, enhance
   regenerative activities, and improve sensory recovery after ischemic
   stroke.}},

Title = {{Estimate of the Maximum Strength of Metallic Glasses from Finite
   Deformation Theory}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Maximum strength sets the limit of a material's intrinsic resistance to
   permanent deformation. Its significance, however, lies not in the
   highest strength value that a solid can possibly achieve, but rather in
   how this quantity is degraded, from which one could decipher the
   underlying mechanisms of yielding in a real material. A wide range of
   maximum strength values have been measured experimentally for metallic
   glasses. However, the true maximum strength remains unknown to date.
   Here, using finite deformation theory, we give the first theoretical
   estimate of the ultimate strength of metallic glasses. Our theoretical
   results, along with those from experiment and simulation, lead us to
   several mechanisms of degradation of the theoretical strength that are
   closely connected to correlated atomic motion with varying
   characteristic length in real metallic glasses.}},

Title = {{Orbital-optimized coupled-electron pair theory and its analytic
   gradients: Accurate equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational
   frequencies, and hydrogen transfer reactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Orbital-optimized coupled-electron pair theory {[}or simply ``optimized
   CEPA(0),{''} OCEPA(0), for short] and its analytic energy gradients are
   presented. For variational optimization of the molecular orbitals for
   the OCEPA(0) method, a Lagrangian-based approach is used along with an
   orbital direct inversion of the iterative subspace algorithm. The cost
   of the method is comparable to that of CCSD {[}O(N-6) scaling] for
   energy computations. However, for analytic gradient computations the
   OCEPA(0) method is only half as expensive as CCSD since there is no need
   to solve the lambda(2)-amplitude equation for OCEPA(0). The performance
   of the OCEPA(0) method is compared with that of the canonical MP2,
   CEPA(0), CCSD, and CCSD(T) methods, for equilibrium geometries, harmonic
   vibrational frequencies, and hydrogen transfer reactions between
   radicals. For bond lengths of both closed and open-shell molecules, the
   OCEPA(0) method improves upon CEPA(0) and CCSD by 25\%-43\% and
   38\%-53\%, respectively, with Dunning's cc-pCVQZ basis set. Especially
   for the open-shell test set, the performance of OCEPA(0) is comparable
   with that of CCSD(T) (Delta R is 0.0003 angstrom on average). For
   harmonic vibrational frequencies of closed-shell molecules, the OCEPA(0)
   method again outperforms CEPA(0) and CCSD by 33\%-79\% and 53\%-79\%,
   respectively. For harmonic vibrational frequencies of open-shell
   molecules, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the OCEPA(0) method (39
   cm(-1)) is fortuitously even better than that of CCSD(T) (50 cm(-1)),
   while the MAEs of CEPA(0) (184 cm(-1)) and CCSD (84 cm(-1)) are
   considerably higher. For complete basis set estimates of hydrogen
   transfer reaction energies, the OCEPA(0) method again exhibits a
   substantially better performance than CEPA(0), providing a mean absolute
   error of 0.7 kcal mol(-1), which is more than 6 times lower than that of
   CEPA(0) (4.6 kcal mol(-1)), and comparing to MP2 (7.7 kcal mol(-1))
   there is a more than 10-fold reduction in errors. Whereas the MAE for
   the CCSD method is only 0.1 kcal mol(-1) lower than that of OCEPA(0).
   Overall, the present application results indicate that the OCEPA(0)
   method is very promising not only for challenging open-shell systems but
   also for closed-shell molecules. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance ester-cross-linkable composite hollow fibers were
   developed through simultaneous spinning of
   4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) based
   polyimide and Torlon (registered trademark of Solvay Polymers)
   solutions. The core layer polyamide-imide polymer, Torlon, demonstrates
   excellent adhesion with cross-linkable 6FDA-based polyimide during
   spinning and ester-cross-linking. Torlon also shows superior thermal
   stability after cross-linking while maintaining the open substructure of
   the Torlon core layer. The resultant cross-linked composite hollow
   fibers show a CO2 permeance of 40 GPU with a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 39
   in testing at 100 psi with 50/50 CO2/CH4 feed, 35 degrees C. The
   cross-linked composite hollow fibers also show high separation
   performance in the presence of high-level toluene contaminants up to
   1000 ppm, suggesting that cross-linked composite hollow fibers are
   viable under realistic operation conditions. The high natural gas
   separation performance and significantly reduced cost of hollow fiber
   formation provides a significant advancement in the state of the art for

Abstract = {{We report the interfacial assembly of amphiphilic heteroarm star
   copolymers (PS(n)P2VP(n) and PSn (P2VP-b-PtBA)(n) (n = 28 arms)) on
   graphene oxide flakes at the air-water interface. Adsorption, spreading,
   and ordering of star polymer micelles on the surface of the basal plane
   and edge of monolayer graphene oxide sheets were investigated on a
   Langmuir trough. This interface-mediated assembly resulted in
   micelle-decorated graphene oxide sheets with uniform spacing and
   organized morphology. We found that the surface activity of solvated
   graphene oxide sheets enables star polymer surfactants to subsequently
   adsorb on the presuspended graphene oxide sheets, thereby producing a
   bilayer complex. The positively charged heterocyclic pyridine-containing
   star polymers exhibited strong affinity onto the basal plane and edge of
   graphene oxide, leading to a well-organized and long-range ordered
   discrete micelle assembly. The preferred binding can be related to the
   increased conformational entropy due to the reduction of interarm
   repulsion. The extent of coverage was tuned by controlling assembly
   parameters such as concentration and solvent polarity. The polymer
   micelles on the basal plane remained incompressible under lateral
   compression in contrast to ones on the water surface due to strongly
   repulsive confined arms on the polar surface of graphene oxide and a
   preventive barrier in the form of the sheet edges. The densely packed
   biphasic tile-like morphology was evident, suggesting the high
   interfacial stability and mechanically stiff nature of graphene oxide
   sheets decorated with star polymer micelles. This noncovalent assembly
   represents a facile route for the control and fabrication of graphene
   oxide-inclusive ultrathin hybrid films applicable for layered
   nanocomposites.}},

Title = {{Hydrophobic - hydrophilic dichotomy of the butterfly proboscis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{85}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Mouthparts of fluid-feeding insects have unique material properties with
   no human-engineered analogue: the feeding devices acquire sticky and
   viscous liquids while remaining clean. We discovered that the external
   surface of the butterfly proboscis has a sharp boundary separating a
   hydrophilic drinking region and a hydrophobic non-drinking region. The
   structural arrangement of the proboscis provides the basis for the
   wetting dichotomy. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that fluid
   uptake is associated with enlargement of hydrophilic cuticular
   structures, the legulae, which link the two halves of the proboscis
   together. We also show that an elliptical proboscis produces a higher
   external meniscus than does a cylindrical proboscis of the same
   circumference. Fluid uptake is additionally facilitated in sap-feeding
   butterflies that have a proboscis with enlarged chemosensory structures
   forming a brush near the tip. This structural modification of the
   proboscis enables sap feeders to exploit films of liquid more
   efficiently. Structural changes along the proboscis, including increased
   legular width and presence of a brush-like tip, occur in a wide range of
   species, suggesting that a wetting dichotomy is widespread in the
   Lepidoptera.}},

Abstract = {{BaZr0.7Sn0.1Y0.2O3- (BZSY) is developed as a novel chemically stable
   proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). BZSY possesses the
   same cubic symmetry of space group Pm-3m with BaZr0.8Y0.2O3- (BZY).
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
   results reveal that BZSY exhibits remarkably enhanced hydration ability
   compared to BZY. Correspondingly, BZSY shows significantly improved
   electrical conductivity. The chemical stability test shows that BZSY is
   quite stable under atmospheres containing CO2 or H2O. Fully dense BZSY
   electrolyte films are successfully fabricated on NiO-BZSY anode
   substrates followed by co-firing at 1400 degrees C for 5 h and the film
   exhibits excellent electrical conductivity under fuel cell conditions.
   The single cell with a 12-m-thick BZSY electrolyte film outputs by far
   the best performance for acceptor-doped BaZrO3-based SOFCs. With wet
   hydrogen (3\% H2O) as the fuel and static air as the oxidant, the peak
   power density of the cell achieves as high as 360 mWcm(-2) at 700
   degrees C, an increase of 42\% compared to the reported highest
   performance of BaZrO3-based cells. The encouraging results demonstrate
   that BZSY is a good candidate as the electrolyte material for next
   generation high performance proton-conducting SOFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Laser assisted micro milling (LAMM) is capable of generating three
   dimensional microscale features in hard metals with lower cutting forces
   than conventional micro milling. To maximize the reduction in cutting
   forces, a mathematical model is required to understand the influence of
   different laser and machining parameters on the forces. Consequently, a
   physics-based force model is developed in this paper to predict the
   cutting forces when micro milling a hard metal using laser assist. LAMM
   experiments are carried out on 52,100 bearing steel (62 HRc) over a
   range of feed rates and laser powers to calibrate the force model. The
   results indicate that the model predicts the cutting force profile with
   good accuracy. This model is then used to study the influence of laser
   assist on cutting forces, which yields a better physical understanding
   of the LAMM process.}},

Abstract = {{Differentially encoding and frequency offset compensating for a
   16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) vector signal in 60-GHz
   millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems are experimentally
   investigated. The fourfold phase ambiguity issue in a non-data-aided
   signal communication transmission system with conventional square 16-QAM
   constellations is successfully tackled based on the differentially
   encoding scheme. Experimental results show that frequency offset
   compensation and carrier phase recovery are simultaneously achieved by
   utilizing the decision-directed carrier phase recovery algorithm. Up to
   similar to +/- 1.3 x 10(-3) frequency offset times symbol rate product
   Delta f . T-s is well compensated at the given bit-error-ratio (BER)
   value of similar to 10(-3).}},

Abstract = {{Kinases become one of important groups of drug targets. To identify more
   kinases being potential for cancer therapy, we developed an integrative
   approach for the large-scale screen of functional genes capable of
   regulating the main traits of cancer metastasis. We first employed
   self-assembled cell microarray to screen functional genes that regulate
   cancer cell migration using a human genome kinase siRNA library. We
   identified 81 genes capable of significantly regulating cancer cell
   migration. Following with invasion assays and bio-informatics analysis,
   we discovered that 16 genes with differentially expression in cancer
   samples can regulate both cell migration and invasion, among which 10
   genes have been well known to play critical roles in the cancer
   development. The remaining 6 genes were experimentally validated to have
   the capacities of regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and anoikis
   activities besides cell motility. Together, these findings provide a new
   insight into the therapeutic use of human kinases.
   From the Clinical Editor: This team of authors have utilized a
   self-assembled cell microarray to screen genes that regulate cancer cell
   migration using a human genome siRNA library of kinases. They validated
   previously known genes and identified novel ones that may serve as
   therapeutic targets. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Atomic-scale dynamic process of deformation-induced stacking fault
   tetrahedra in gold nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Stacking fault tetrahedra, the three-dimensional crystalline defects
   bounded by stacking faults and stair-rod dislocations, are often
   observed in quenched or irradiated face-centred cubic metals and alloys.
   All of the stacking fault tetrahedra experimentally observed to date are
   believed to originate from vacancies. Here we report, in contrast to the
   classical vacancy-originated ones, a new kind of stacking fault
   tetrahedra formed via the interaction and cross-slip of partial
   dislocations in gold nanocrystals. The complete atomic-scale processes
   of nucleation, migration and annihilation of the dislocation-originated
   stacking fault tetrahedra are revealed by in situ high-resolution
   observations and molecular dynamics simulations. The
   dislocation-originated stacking fault tetrahedra can undergo migration
   and annihilation due to mechanical loading in a manner that is not
   expected in bulk samples. These results uncover a unique deformation
   mechanism via dislocation interaction inside the confined volume of
   nanocrystals and have important implications regarding the size effect
   on the mechanical behaviour of small-volume materials.}},

Abstract = {{Many global development agencies self-report their project outcomes,
   often relying on subjective data that is collected sporadically and
   communicated months later. These reports often highlight successes and
   downplay challenges. Instrumented monitoring via distributed data
   collection platforms may provide crucial evidence to help inform the
   sector and public on the effectiveness of aid, and the on-going
   challenges. This paper presents the process of designing and validating
   an integrated sensor platform with cellular-to-internet reporting
   purposely targeted at global development programs. The integrated
   hardware platform has been applied to water, sanitation, energy and
   infrastructure interventions and validated through laboratory
   calibration and field observations. Presented here are two examples: a
   water pump and a household water filter, wherein field observations
   agreed with the data algorithm with a linear fit slope of between 0.91
   and 1, and an r-squared of between 0.36 and 0.39, indicating a wide
   confidence interval but with low overall error (i.e., less than 0.5\% in
   the case of structured field observations of water volume added to a
   household water filter) and few false negatives or false positives.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous, smooth, visibly defect-free, lithographically patterned
   activated carbon films (ACFs) are prepared on the surface of silicon
   wafers. Depending on the synthesis conditions, porous ACFs can either
   remain attached to the initial substrate or be separated and transferred
   to another dense or porous substrate of interest. Tuning the activation
   conditions allows one to change the surface area and porosity of the
   produced carbon films. Here we utilize the developed thin ACF technology
   to produce prototypes of functional electrical double-layer capacitor
   devices. The synthesized thin carbon film electrodes demonstrated very
   high capacitance in excess of 510 F g(-1) (>390 F cm(-3)) at a slow
   cyclic voltammetry scan rate of 1 mV s(-1) and in excess of 325 F g(-1)
   (>250 F cm(-3)) in charge-discharge tests at an ultrahigh current
   density of 45 000 mA g(-1). Good stability was demonstrated after 10 000
   galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The high values of the specific
   and volumetric capacitances of the selected ACF electrodes as well as
   the capacity retention at high current densities demonstrated great
   potential of the proposed technology for the fabrication of various
   on-chip devices, such as micro-electrochemical capacitors.}},

Title = {{Ferritin Nanocages To Encapsulate and Deliver Photosensitizers for

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy is an emerging treatment modality that is under,
   intensive preclinical and clinical investigations for many types of
   disease including cancer. Despite the promise, there is a lack of a
   reliable drug delivery vehicle that can transport photosensitizers (PSs)
   to tumors in a site-specific manner: Previous efforts have been focused
   on polymer- or liposome-based nanocarriers, which are usually associated
   with a suboptimal PS loading rate and a large particle size. We report
   herein that a RGD4C-modified ferritin (RFRT), a protein-based
   nanoparticle, can serve as a safe and efficient PS vehicle. Zinc
   hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (ZnF16Pc), a potent PS with a high 102
   quantum yield but poor water solubility, can be encapsulated into RFRTs
   with a loading rate as high as similar to 60 wt \% (i.e, 13 mg of
   ZnF16Pc can be loaded on 1 mg of RAM), which far exceeds those reported
   previously.. Despite the high loading, the ZnF16Pc-loaded Fans (P-RFRTs)
   show an overall particle size of 18.6 +/- 2.6 nm, which is significantly
   smaller than other PS-nanocarrier conjugates: When tested on U87MG
   subcutaneous tumor models, P-RFRTs showed a high tumor accumulation rate
   (tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 26.82 +/- 4.07at 24 h), a good tumor
   inhibition rate (8164\% on day 12), as well as minimal toxicity to the
   skin and other major organs. This technology can be extended to deliver
   other metal-containing PSs and holds great clinical translation
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting mechanical energy is becoming increasingly important for its
   availability and abundance in our living environment. Triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) is a simple, cost-effective, and highly efficient
   approach for generating electricity from mechanical energies in a wide
   range of forms. Here, we developed a TENG designed for harvesting
   tiny-scale wind energy available in our normal living environment using
   conventional materials. The energy harvester is based on a rotary driven
   mechanical deformation of multiple plate-based TENGs. The operation
   mechanism is a hybridization of the contact-sliding-separation-contact
   processes by using the triboelectrification and electrostatic induction
   effects. With the introduction of polymer nanowires on surfaces, the
   rotary TENG delivers an open-circuit voltage of 250 V and a
   short-circuit current of 0.25 mA, corresponding to a maximum power
   density of similar to 39 W/m(2) at a wind speed of similar to 15 m/s,
   which is capable of directly driving hundreds of electronic devices such
   as commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), or rapidly charging
   capacitors. The rotary TENG was also applied as a self-powered sensor
   for measuring wind speed. This work represents a significant progress in
   the practical application of the TENG and its great potential in the
   future wind power technology. This technology can also be extended for
   harvesting energy from ocean current, making nanotechnology reaching our
   daily life a possibility in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{We report a single-electrode-based sliding-mode triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) that not only can harvest mechanical energy but
   also is a self-powered displacement vector sensor system for touching
   pad technology. By utilizing the relative sliding between an
   electrodeless polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch with surface-etched
   nanoparticles and an Al electrode that is grounded, the fabricated TENG
   can produce an open-circuit voltage up to 1100 V, a short-circuit
   current density of 6 mA/m(2), and a maximum power density of 350 mW/m(2)
   on a load of 100 M Omega, which can be used to instantaneously drive 100
   green-light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The working mechanism of the TENG is
   based on the charge transfer between the Al electrode and the ground by
   modulating the relative sliding distance between the tribo-charged PTFE
   patch and the Al plate. Grating of linear rows on the Al electrode
   enables the detection of the sliding speed of the PTFE patch along one
   direction. Moreover, we demonstrated that 16 Al electrode channels
   arranged along four directions were used to monitor the displacement
   (the direction and the location) of the PTFE patch at the center, where
   the output voltage signals in the 16 channels were recorded in real-time
   to form a mapping figure. The advantage of this design is that it only
   requires the bottom Al electrode to be grounded and the top PTFE patch
   needs no electrical contact, which is beneficial for energy harvesting
   in automobile rotation mode and touch pad applications.}},

Title = {{Pulsed Nanogenerator with Huge Instantaneous Output Power Density}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{7383-7391}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A nanogenerator (NG) usually gives a high output voltage but low output
   current, so that the output power is low. In this paper, we developed a
   general approach that gives a hugely improved instantaneous output power
   of the NG, while the entire output energy stays the same. Our design is
   based on an offonoff contact based switching during mechanical
   triggering that largely reduces the duration of the charging/discharge
   process, so that the instantaneous output current pulse is hugely
   improved without sacrificing the output voltage. For a vertical
   contact-separation mode triboelectric NG (TENG), the instantaneous
   output current and power peak can reach as high as 0.53 A and 142 W at a
   load of 500 Omega, respectively. The corresponding instantaneous output
   current and power density peak even approach 1325 A/m(2) and 3.6 x 105
   W/m(2), which are more than 2500 and 1100 times higher than the previous
   records of TENG, respectively. For the rotation disk based TENG in the
   lateral sliding mode, the instantaneous output current and power density

Abstract = {{Theoretically optimal performance and behavior of a routing protocol are
   very important because they can be used to guide the design of practical
   protocols. Motivated by the promising lifetime performance of an
   existing suboptimal cooperative transmission (CT) routing protocol for
   wireless sensor networks, we formulate the lifetime-optimization problem
   using linear programming (LP), which requires considerations of CT's
   unique characteristics and sophisticated variable definitions. By
   evaluating LP for various cases, we show the effectiveness of
   cooperative routing by comparing it with the non-CT case. Also, by
   analyzing the LP solution, we identify some important factors and
   behaviors of optimal cooperative routing. More specifically, we conclude
   that (i) matching the rate of doing CT and matching the candidate pools
   of cooperators to the LP solution are important factors to achieve
   near-optimal lifetime performances, and, (ii) for small multi-hop
   networks, the design of cooperative routing can be simplified because
   one may use the sink node as a single VMISO receiver and rely on the
   existing energy-aware routing for the primary routing.}},

Abstract = {{We present a de novo re-determination of the secondary (2 degrees)
   structure and domain architecture of the 23S and 5S rRNAs, using 3D
   structures, determined by X-ray diffraction, as input. In the
   traditional 2 degrees structure, the center of the 23S rRNA is an
   extended single strand, which in 3D is seen to be compact and double
   helical. Accurately assigning nucleotides to helices compels a revision
   of the 23S rRNA 2 degrees structure. Unlike the traditional 2 degrees
   structure, the revised 2 degrees structure of the 23S rRNA shows
   architectural similarity with the 16S rRNA. The revised 2 degrees
   structure also reveals a clear relationship with the 3D structure and is
   generalizable to rRNAs of other species from all three domains of life.
   The 2 degrees structure revision required us to reconsider the domain
   architecture. We partitioned the 23S rRNA into domains through analysis
   of molecular interactions, calculations of 2D folding propensities and
   compactness. The best domain model for the 23S rRNA contains seven
   domains, not six as previously ascribed. Domain 0 forms the core of the
   23S rRNA, to which the other six domains are rooted. Editable 2 degrees
   structures mapped with various data are provided (

Title = {{Visual Nonclassical Receptive Field Effects Emerge from Sparse Coding in
   a Dynamical System}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Extensive electrophysiology studies have shown that many V1 simple cells
   have nonlinear response properties to stimuli within their classical
   receptive field (CRF) and receive contextual influence from stimuli
   outside the CRF modulating the cell's response. Models seeking to
   explain these non-classical receptive field (nCRF) effects in terms of
   circuit mechanisms, input-output descriptions, or individual visual
   tasks provide limited insight into the functional significance of these
   response properties, because they do not connect the full range of nCRF
   effects to optimal sensory coding strategies. The (population) sparse
   coding hypothesis conjectures an optimal sensory coding approach where a
   neural population uses as few active units as possible to represent a
   stimulus. We demonstrate that a wide variety of nCRF effects are
   emergent properties of a single sparse coding model implemented in a
   neurally plausible network structure (requiring no parameter tuning to
   produce different effects). Specifically, we replicate a wide variety of
   nCRF electrophysiology experiments (e. g., end-stopping, surround
   suppression, contrast invariance of orientation tuning,
   cross-orientation suppression, etc.) on a dynamical system implementing
   sparse coding, showing that this model produces individual units that
   reproduce the canonical nCRF effects. Furthermore, when the population
   diversity of an nCRF effect has also been reported in the literature, we
   show that this model produces many of the same population
   characteristics. These results show that the sparse coding hypothesis,
   when coupled with a biophysically plausible implementation, can provide
   a unified high-level functional interpretation to many response
   properties that have generally been viewed through distinct mechanistic
   or phenomenological models.}},

Abstract = {{The shock induced by a rocket lift-off and pyrotechnic device actuation
   for interstage separation can cause damage to the on-board instruments
   of a spacecraft when the acceleration generated by the input shock
   exceeds their allowable acceleration value. The shock can be attenuated
   by mounting a shock absorber. In this paper, we propose a variable
   damping shock attenuation strategy combined with conventional
   semi-active vibration control laws derived from a two elements model
   composed of variable damping and spring stiffness that would attenuate
   the shock such that the main instrument's input acceleration does not
   exceed the allowable acceleration value. The analysis results indicate
   that the combination of shock and conventional semi-active control logic
   attenuates the shock level better than an optimal passive and
   conventional semi-active control system. The strategy is also effective
   for suppressing the consequent vibration induced by the shock event. (c)

Abstract = {{Although wireless microsensors can add performance-enhancing and
   energy-saving intelligence to factories, hospitals, and others, their
   tiny onboard sources are exhausted quickly. Luckily, coupling power
   inductively can both energize system components and recharge a battery.
   Miniaturized receiver coils, however, capture a small fraction of the
   magnetic energy available; thus, coupling factors k(C) and, as a result,
   power-conversion efficiencies are low. In other words, damping the
   magnetic source so it outputs maximum power is difficult. Investing
   energy into the coil increases its ability to draw power, but only when
   optimized. Since state-of-the-art systems can only recycle harvested
   energy, they are optimal only at one k(C) value. The inductively coupled
   180-nm CMOS charger prototyped, measured, and presented here invests
   programmable amounts of battery energy into the pickup coil to generate
   8-390 mu W when k(C) is 0.009-0.076 and raise output power by 132\% and
   24\% at k(C)'s of 0.020 and 0.076, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic launchers (EML) are currently limited due to rail
   durability. The rail operating environment consists of large electrical
   currents, high local temperatures, large electromagnetic loads, and high
   sliding velocities. The desire to maximize magnetic energy for
   performance and durability for economic viability are the main
   objectives in selecting a rail material. A systematic process, often
   referred to as the Ashby method is used. The three steps include
   translating the design requirements into objectives and constraints,
   screening out materials that do not meet basic performance criteria, and
   ranking material candidates to maximize the objectives. Gouges, grooves,
   and fracture were identified as the three most life limiting forms of
   rail damage responsible for durability. Material property tradeoff plots
   show that magnetic energy and durability are conflicting objectives. A
   hybrid rail material in the form of a monolayer structure with an
   electrically conductive substrate and a damage resistant surface layer
   is the ideal configuration for maximizing the objectives. The results
   suggest that a conductive substrate, such as copper, is best for
   maintaining performance by means of magnetic energy and a damage
   resistant surface material consisting of tungsten, chromium, nickel, or
   tantalum has the best potential for increasing rail durability.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of 63 MeV proton irradiation on the RF performance
   (insertion loss, isolation, and linearity) of triple-well nFET-based RF
   switches designed in a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology are investigated.
   The switches were designed for wide-band operation (1 to 40 GHz) and
   were required by the application to achieve high isolation (> 35 dB at
   40 GHz) with moderate insertion loss (< 6 dB at 40 GHz). The RF switch
   IL improves (S-21 increases) at 100 and 500 krad(SiO2), but degrades
   (S-21 decreases) at 2 Mrad(SiO2). P-1dB and IIP3 (switch linearity)
   shows a similar TID response, at 100 and 500 krad(SiO2) dose an increase
   of similar to 0.4 dBm and similar to 0.2 dBm, respectively. However, at
   2 Mrad(SiO2) both sharply decrease. Standalone RF and dc structures were
   also irradiated to better understand the underlying mechanisms affecting
   the switch RF performance. The bias dependence of the radiation-induced
   change on the measured RF performance of a SPST switch is also analyzed.
   10 keV X-ray radiation experiments were conducted on separate dc

Title = {{The use of surface-initiated polymerization to reduce template feature
   size and facilitate fabrication of 3D freestanding nanostructures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We report the use of surface-initiated polymerization (SIP) to
   facilitate nanolithography-based template-directed synthesis of various
   3D freestanding nanostructures (sub-10 nm) with arbitrary 3D anisotropic
   shapes and different compositions on the nano/ molecular scale in a
   designated way. In particular, SIP is combined with ``top-down{''}
   nanolithographic techniques, such as electron-beam lithography, to
   fabricate nanotemplates with 3D recessed nanosites that possess both
   reduced feature size and anisotropic surface functionalities.
   Implementation of SIP can address the technical challenge for
   nanolithography to directly produce molecular-scale feature sizes, since
   the scale gap between what nanolithography can achieve and molecular
   feature sizes can be bridged, both in terms of size as well as chemical
   functionality, by the SIP-induced polymer layer. More significantly it
   enables a nanotemplate with tunable surface chemistry, leading to
   appropriate registration of nano-objects onto the template for molding
   as well as effective de-molding, resulting in 3D conformal freestanding
   synthetic nanostructures. In this work both 0-D polystyrene colloidal
   nanoparticles (NPs) and polystyrene-iron(III) oxide composites NPs are
   properly assembled and molded by the templates resulting in different
   nanostructures with desirable shapes and functionalities. The
   demonstrated 3D freestanding nanostructures (sub-10 nm) include
   ``nanomushrooms,{''} ``nanobuttons,{''} ``nanospikes,{''}
   ``nanospaghetti,{''} and ``nanoflowers{''}. In addition, the resultant
   PS-Fe3O4 composite nanostructures and their assemblies show
   ferromagnetic properties. Although the template-based surface synthesis
   produces low quantities compared to a traditional ``bottom- up{''}
   chemical synthesis method, the templates allow for specific design of
   shapes and chemical functionalities of NPs to be directly designed,
   which may be advantageous in many applications such as drug delivery or
   imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Anion-conductive multiblock copoly(arylene ether sulfone)s (mPES) were
   synthesized with different block lengths and ion-exchange capacities
   (IEC) to maximize ion conductivity and explore the relationship between
   chemical structure and morphology in anion-exchange membranes (AEM).
   Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry was used to probe water
   mobility and domain size. The multiblock copolymers were synthesized by
   polycondensation of separately prepared hydroxy-terminated oligomers
   with fluoro-terminated oligomers. The polymers were made ion-conductive
   through selective chloromethylation of one of the two block types,
   followed by quatemization and hydroxide ion exchange. The resulting
   block structure, in which one type is hydrophilic and one type is
   hydrophobic, was designed to ensure a nanophase-separated morphology.
   The multiblock copolymers exhibited higher anion conductivity than their
   random copolymer counterparts at the same IEC. The multiblock copolymer
   that exhibited the highest anion conductivity was not the one with the
   highest IEC, but it was the one with the shortest NMR relaxation times
   for water, indicating a greater fraction of water interacts with the
   ionic polymer segments. Higher IEC values led to increased water
   absorption, an effective dilution of the ionic groups, and increased NMR
   relaxation times for water.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{346-358}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The problem of choosing a design that is representative of a finite
   candidate set is an important problem in computer experiments. The
   minimax criterion measures the degree of representativeness because it
   is the maximum distance of a candidate point to the design. This article
   proposes a method for finding minimax designs for finite design regions.
   We establish the relationship between minimax designs and the classical
   set covering location problem (SCLP) in operations research, which is a
   binary linear program. In particular, we prove that the set of minimax
   distances is the set of discontinuities of the function that maps the
   covering radius to the optimal objective function value. We show that
   solving the SCLP at the points of discontinuities, which can be
   determined, gives minimax designs. These results are employed to design
   an efficient procedure for finding minimax designs for small-sized
   candidate sets. A heuristic procedure is proposed to generate
   near-minimax designs for large candidate sets. Supplementary materials
   for this article are available online.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of the thermal performance of the
   Helium-Cooled Multi-Jet (HEMJ) modular divertor design developed by the
   Karlsruhe Research Center (FZK) was previously performed at Georgia Tech
   using air at Reynolds numbers (Re) spanning those at which the actual
   He-cooled divertor is to be operated. More recently, another
   experimental investigation was performed by the Georgia Tech group for a
   similar finger-type divertor module using both air and He as coolants.
   The results of these experiments suggest that, in addition to matching
   Re, dynamic similarity between the air and He experiments requires that
   a correction be made to account for the differences in the relative
   contributions of convection and conduction (through the divertor walls)
   to the overall heat removal rate by the module. This correction factor
   depends on the thermal conductivity ratio of the solid to the coolant.
   Experiments similar to those previously conducted have therefore been
   performed using air, argon, or He as coolant for test sections
   constructed of brass or steel thus covering a wide range of thermal
   conductivity ratio. The resultant correlation between Re, the heat
   removal rate, and the thermal conductivity ratio from these experiments
   can be used to predict the thermal performance of HEMJ-like divertors at
   prototypical operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The helium-cooled modular divertor concept with integrated pin array
   developed by the Karlsruhe Research Center (FZK) is unusual among
   helium-cooled tungsten divertor designs in that it relies upon an array
   of pin fins on the back of the cooled surface, instead of jet
   impingement, to cool the plasma-facing surface. The Georgia Tech group
   experimentally studied a similar design constructed of brass which
   combined jet impingement with an array of identical cylindrical pin fins
   using air at nondimensional coolant mass flow rates, i.e. Reynolds
   numbers, which spanned the range expected under prototypical conditions.
   The results suggested that the pin-fin array, at least for the
   particular geometry studied, provides little, if any, additional cooling
   beyond that provided by jet impingement.
   Given that this earlier study considered only one pin-fin array
   geometry, however, a numerical study was performed to investigate
   whether changes in the array geometry could improve performance.
   Specifically, numerical simulations using the commercially available
   computational fluid dynamics software package ANSYS (R) 14.0 was used to
   examine how varying the pitch-to-diameter ratio for the fin array and
   the height of the fins affected average pressure boundary temperature
   and the pressure drop across the divertor. These results can, with
   appropriate experimental validation, be used to determine whether
   pin-fin arrays can be used to improve the thermal performance of
   helium-cooled tungsten divertors.}},

Abstract = {{High penetration of intermittent renewable energy imposes new challenges
   to the operation and control of power systems. Power system security
   needs to be ensured dynamically as the system operating condition
   continuously changes. The dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF)
   control algorithm using the Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDs) has shown
   promising dynamic power flow control capability and has been
   demonstrated in a small system. To further investigate the potential of
   the DSOPF control algorithm for large power systems, a 70-bus test power
   system with different generation resources, including large wind plants,
   is developed. A two-level DSOPF control scheme is proposed in this paper
   to scale up the DSOPF algorithm for this 70-bus system. The lower-level
   area DSOPF controllers control their own area power network. The
   top-level global DSOPF controller coordinates the area controllers by
   adjusting the inter-area tie-line flows. This two-level architecture
   distributes the control and computation burden to multiple area DSOPF
   controllers, and reduces the training difficulty for implementing the
   DSOPF control for a large power network. Simulation studies on the
   70-bus power system with large wind variation are shown to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed two-level DSOPF control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the impact of drawing poly(ethylene terephthalate)
   (PET) fibers in the presence of solvents, which consist of the first
   five homologues of aliphatic primary alcohols, namely methanol to amyl
   alcohol. The solvent induced deformation under tensile load leads to
   surface fissures characterized by four stages: fissure formation
   (birth), incipient draw (neck formation), partial draw, and full draw.
   This process results in internal void formation in the presence of a
   propagating neck. A design of experiment (DOE) was performed to screen
   out the process parameters critical for understanding surface fissure
   formation. Four process parameters were investigated: initial material
   properties (orientation); environment of draw (i.e. type of alcohols
   used as solvent); rate of extension; and amount of extension. The
   response of solvent induced deformation were characterized by the
   natural draw force reduction; number of fissures formed at time of
   birth, fissure width at time of formation, and neck angle. Of all the
   four process parameters involved, the analysis indicates that the
   material properties and amount of extension were the best predictors of
   solvent induced fissure formation. Organic solvents reduce the tension
   required for draw and create internal voids, a porous network, with
   possibly the penetrant being ``sucked{''} into the interior of PET
   fibers drawn in the presence of alcohols.}},

   activity in room temperature, liquid phase hydrogenation of
   diphenylacetylene to selectively produce cis-stilbene. Interestingly, it
   was found that the rate of over-hydrogenation could be significantly
   reduced by increasing the support porosity and using a

   competitive with the best palladium catalysts known for the selective

Title = {{The fate of lignin during hydrothermal pretreatment}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Effective enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass
   benefits from lignin removal, relocation, and/or modification during
   hydrothermal pretreatment. Phase transition,
   depolymerization/repolymerization, and solubility effects may all
   influence these lignin changes. To better understand how lignin is
   altered, Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides wood samples and
   cellulolytic enzyme lignin (CEL) isolated from P. trichocarpa x P.
   deltoides were subjected to batch and flowthrough pretreatments. The
   residual solids and liquid hydrolysate were characterized by gel
   permeation chromatography, heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR,
   compositional analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Results: Changes in the structure of the solids recovered after the
   pretreatment of CEL and the production of aromatic monomers point
   strongly to depolymerization and condensation being primary mechanisms
   for lignin extraction and redeposition. The differences in lignin
   removal and phenolic compound production from native P. trichocarpa x P.
   deltoides and CEL suggested that lignin-carbohydrate interactions
   increased lignin extraction and the extractability of syringyl groups
   relative to guaiacyl groups.
   Conclusions: These insights into delignification during hydrothermal
   pretreatment point to desirable pretreatment strategies and plant
   modifications. Because depolymerization followed by repolymerization
   appears to be the dominant mode of lignin modification, limiting the
   residence time of depolymerized lignin moieties in the bulk liquid phase
   should reduce lignin content in pretreated biomass. In addition, the
   increase in lignin removal in the presence of polysaccharides suggests
   that increasing lignin-carbohydrate cross-links in biomass would
   increase delignification during pretreatment.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Our focus herein is to evaluate the potential interaction between nC(60)
   and copper, a trace necessary metal, in light of the impact on toxicity.
   The non-observable effects concentration (NOEC) of nC(60) was confirmed
   as 100 mu g L-1 before. When Daphnia magna was exposed to the mixture of
   copper solution and nC(60) suspension (100 mu g L-1), LC50 of 48 h was
   lower than that when they were exposed to copper solution alone. This
   result clearly showed the decrease in NOEC of copper at the presence of
   nC(60). Cu2+-ATPase activity was enhanced at the presence of nC(60),
   indicating that copper transport involved with the uptake, distribution
   and depuration in body was increased. We further conducted experiments
   on accumulation of copper in D. magna. The observed equilibrium copper
   concentration in D. magna in the mixture of 100 mu g L-1 nC(60) and 1 mu
   g L-1 copper solution reached 131 mu g (kg wet weight)(-1), which was
   more than twice that in copper solution only: 60 mu g (kg wet
   weight)(-1). This result demonstrated that the accumulation of copper in
   D. magna was significantly enhanced at the presence of even low nC(60)
   concentration. Experiments also showed that copper was quickly adsorbed
   onto nC(60). The absorption of copper onto D. magna was statistically
   correlated to the absorption of nC(60) onto D. magna; this might be
   caused by nC(60) facilitating the transfer of copper into D. magna. The
   absorption and desorption of copper to nC(60) (pH = 5.0) reached
   equilibrium quickly, which may be involved with the co-bioaccumulation
   and decrease in NOEC of Cu2+ and nC(60). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A laser ultrasound and interferometer inspection system has been
   successfully applied to detect solder bump defects, including missing,
   misaligned, open, and cracked solder bumps in flip chips, land grid
   array packages and chip capacitors. This system uses a pulsed Nd:YAG
   laser to induce ultrasound in the chip packages in the thermoelastic
   regime; it then measures the transient out-of-plane displacement
   response on the package surface using a laser interferometer. The
   amplitudes of the out-of-plane displacement responses are usually in the
   order of nanometer. The quality of solder bumps is evaluated by
   analyzing the transient responses. In this paper, this system is used to
   evaluate the quality of lead-free solder bumps in ball grid array (BGA)
   packages; specifically, BGA packages with poor wetted solder bumps are
   used as test vehicles. Poor wetting not only decreases the mechanical
   strength of interconnection at the interface between the solder bumps
   and substrate, but also deteriorates electrical and thermal performance
   because of the unreliable connections between the package and the
   printed circuit board (PCB). Causes of poor wetting vary from the solder
   materials themselves to the manufacturing process. Here, poor wetting of
   solder bumps were intentionally created by using an improper reflow
   profile. The transient out-of-plane displacement signal responses from
   these packages are compared to a hybrid reference signal generated by
   signal responses from defect-free samples. Packages with poor wetted
   solder bumps are distinguished from the normal packages by using the
   correlation coefficient signal analysis method. Then, laser ultrasound
   inspection results are also compared with results from continuity test,
   X-ray inspection and scanning acoustic microscope (SAM). Finally, the
   cross-section images are further used to confirm the existence of the
   poor wetting in samples with unusual correlation coefficient. It can be
   concluded that this laser-ultrasound system is capable of identifying
   the presence of poor wetting in BGA packages.}},

Abstract = {{Solder joint voids are usually formed by the entrapped gas bubbles
   during the reflow process and are common in all surface mount
   applications. It is a controversial issue on the reliability of the
   solder joint; however, the consensus is that voiding is only acceptable
   at low contents, whereas excessive voiding affects mechanical
   properties, and decreases strength, ductility, and fatigue life of the
   interconnections. X-ray is the most widely used technique to evaluate
   the voids, including the size and occurrence frequency. In this paper, a
   laser ultrasound and interferometer inspection system is used to inspect
   the voids in lead-free solder bumps in ball grid array packages. This
   system uses a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to induce ultrasound in the chip
   packages in the thermoelastic regime; and laser interferometer is used
   to measure the transient out-of-plane displacement response of the
   package surface to the laser irradiation. The quality of solder bumps is
   evaluated by analyzing the transient responses. In this paper, voids are
   intentionally created by adding the volatile flux during the assembly
   process. Through controlling the volume of flux dip, three different
   levels of voiding are proposed: 1) void free; 2) relatively low; and 3)
   relatively high. The presence of voids in the solder bumps is first
   verified using a 2-D X-ray technique. Meanwhile, the built-in
   image-processing software in X-ray tool measures the void fraction to
   quantify the level of voiding. A scanning acoustic microscope technique
   is also used to evaluate the void in the solder bumps. Then the laser
   ultrasound inspection system is used to evaluate the voids in these
   samples. Through comparing the vibration responses from the chip with
   solder bump voids and void-free chips, it is found that the laser
   ultrasound inspection system is capable of differentiating the chips
   with relatively high voiding from the void-free chip whereas the
   relatively low voiding is below the resolution of the inspection system.
   Finally, a further comparison between the void-free and voided solder
   bumps is carried out by the destructive cross-sectional technique. The
   comparisons among these different evaluation methods on solder bump
   voids will be presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the fabrication and the experimental
   characterization of a wavenumber frequency-steerable acoustic transducer
   (WS-FSAT). Here, the transducer is employed for the localization of
   broadband acoustic events corresponding to the propagation of guided
   elastic waves in an isotropic plate. The WS-FSAT records the plate
   response and defines the source location through a time-frequency
   analysis of the received signal. This is achieved by exploiting the
   frequency selective response of the transducer which directly maps the
   dominant component of the received signal to the direction of arrival of
   the incoming wave. This feature is the result of the spatial filtering
   effect produced by the characteristic shape of the sensing surface,
   which is designed in the wavenumber domain. Experiments are performed on
   a prototype fabricated on a polyvinylidene fluoride substrate mounted on
   an aluminum test plate. Tests are conducted for various source
   locations, and with multiple sources activated simultaneously. The
   results highlight the robustness of the proposed device, its good
   sensitivity and angular resolution, as well as the low complexity of
   hardware and signal processing. This paper suggests the WS-FSAT as an
   attractive solution for the detection of broadband acoustic events, such
   as impacts on structural substrates, and its potential use as part of
   active structural health monitoring systems based on pitch-catch or
   pulse-echo operations.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability assessment standards are currently being developed for a
   range of building products. This activity has been stimulated through
   the considerable success of the U. S. Green Building Council's (USGBC)
   LEED (TM) standard. Transparent life cycle-based standards can guide
   manufacturers to design products that have reduced environmental impact.
   The use of a sustainability standard can certify performance and avoid
   green washing. In this article we present a logical framework for
   designing a sustainability assessment standard through the creation of
   tables that award points in the standard to be consistent with life
   cycle information. Certain minimum principles of consistency are
   articulated. In the case that the life cycle impact assessment method
   maps the life cycle inventory to impact through a linear weighting, two
   design approaches-impact category and activity substitution-are
   constructed to be consistent with these principles. The approach is
   illustrated in a case study of a partial redesign of a carpet
   sustainability assessment standard (NSF/ANSI-140).}},

Title = {{Toward a planning scheme for emission guided radiation therapy (EGRT):
   FDG based tumor tracking in a metastatic breast cancer patient}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Emission guided radiation therapy (EGRT) is a new modality that
   uses PET emissions in real-time for direct tumor tracking during
   radiation delivery. Radiation beamlets are delivered along positron
   emission tomography (PET) lines of response (LORs) by a fast rotating
   ring therapy unit consisting of a linear accelerator (Linac) and PET
   detectors. The feasibility of tumor tracking and a primitive modulation
   method to compensate for attenuation have been demonstrated using a 4D
   digital phantom in our prior work. However, the essential capability of
   achieving dose modulation as in conventional intensity modulated
   radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments remains absent. In this work, the
   authors develop a planning scheme for EGRT to accomplish sophisticated
   intensity modulation based on an IMRT plan while preserving tumor
   tracking.
   Methods: The planning scheme utilizes a precomputed LOR response
   probability distribution to achieve desired IMRT planning modulation
   with effects of inhomogeneous attenuation and non-uniform background
   activity distribution accounted for. Evaluation studies are performed on
   a 4D digital patient with a simulated lung tumor and a clinical patient
   who has a moving breast cancer metastasis in the lung. The Linac dose
   delivery is simulated using a voxel-based Monte Carlo algorithm. The
   IMRT plan is optimized for a planning target volume (PTV) that
   encompasses the tumor motion using the MOSEK package and a
   Pinnacle(3)(TM) workstation (Philips Healthcare, Fitchburg, WI) for
   digital and clinical patients, respectively. To obtain the emission data
   for both patients, the Geant4 application for tomographic emission
   (GATE) package and a commercial PET scanner are used. As a comparison,
   3D and helical IMRT treatments covering the same PTV based on the same
   IMRT plan are simulated.
   Results: 3D and helical IMRT treatments show similar dose distribution.
   In the digital patient case, compared with the 3D IMRT treatment, EGRT
   achieves a 15.1\% relative increase in dose to 95\% of the gross tumor
   volume (GTV) and a 31.8\% increase to 50\% of the GTV. In the patient
   case, EGRT yields a 15.2\% relative increase in dose to 95\% of the GTV
   and a 20.7\% increase to 50\% of the GTV. The organs at risk (OARs)
   doses are kept similar or lower for EGRT in both cases. Tumor tracking
   is observed in the presence of planning modulation in all EGRT
   treatments.
   Conclusions: As compared to conventional IMRT treatments, the proposed
   EGRT planning scheme allows an escalated target dose while keeping dose
   to the OARs within the same planning limits. With the capabilities of
   incorporating planning modulation and accurate tumor tracking, EGRT has
   the potential to greatly improve targeting in radiation therapy and
   enable a practical and effective implementation of 4D radiation therapy
   for planning and delivery. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a proof-of-principle L-shell x-ray fluorescence
   (XRF) imaging system that locates and quantifies sparse concentrations
   of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using a benchtop polychromatic x-ray source
   and a silicon (Si)-PIN diode x-ray detector system.
   Methods: 12-mm-diameter water-filled cylindrical tubes with GNP
   concentrations of 20, 10, 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, and 0 mg/cm(3) served as
   calibration phantoms. An imaging phantom was created using the same
   cylindrical tube but filled with tissue-equivalent gel containing
   structures mimicking a GNP-loaded blood vessel and approximately 1 cm(3)
   tumor. Phantoms were irradiated by a 3-mm-diameter pencil-beam of 62 kVp
   x-rays filtered by 1 mm aluminum. Fluorescence/scatter photons from
   phantoms were detected at 90 degrees with respect to the beam direction
   using a Si-PIN detector placed behind a 2.5-mm-diameter lead collimator.
   The imaging phantom was translated horizontally and vertically in 0.3-mm
   steps to image a 6 mm x 15 mm region of interest (ROI). For each
   phantom, the net L-shell XRF signal from GNPs was extracted from
   background, and then corrected for detection efficiency and in-phantom
   attenuation using a fluorescence-to-scatter normalization algorithm.
   Results: XRF measurements with calibration phantoms provided a
   calibration curve showing a linear relationship between corrected XRF
   signal and GNP mass per imaged voxel. Using the calibration curve, the
   detection limit (at the 95\% confidence level) of the current
   experimental setup was estimated to be a GNP mass of 0.35 mu g per
   imaged voxel (1.73 x 10(-2) cm(3)). A 2D XRF map of the ROI was also
   successfully generated, reasonably matching the known spatial
   distribution as well as showing the local variation of GNP
   concentrations.
   Conclusions: L-shell XRF imaging can be a highly sensitive tool that has
   the capability of simultaneously imaging the spatial distribution and
   determining the local concentration of GNPs presented on the order of
   parts-per-million level within subcentimeter-sized ex vivo samples and
   superficial tumors during preclinical animal studies. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Objective: Current histological scoring methods to evaluate efficacy of
   potential therapeutics for slowing or preventing joint degeneration are
   time-consuming and semi-quantitative in nature. Hence, there is a need
   to develop and standardize quantitative outcome measures to define
   sensitive metrics for studying potential therapeutics. The objectives of
   this study were to use equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast
   agent via Equilibrium Partitioning of an Ionic Contrast-Microcomputed
   tomography (EPIC-mu CT) to quantitatively characterize morphological and
   compositional changes in the tibial articular cartilage in two distinct
   models of joint degeneration and define localized regions of interest to
   detect degenerative cartilage changes.
   Materials and Methods: The monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) and medial
   meniscal transection (MMT) rat models were used in this study. Three
   weeks post-surgery, tibiae were analyzed using EPIC-mu CT and histology.
   EPIC-mu CT allowed measurement of 3D morphological changes in cartilage
   thickness, volume and composition.
   Results: Extensive cartilage degeneration was observed throughout the
   joint in the MIA model after 3 weeks. In contrast, the MMT model showed
   more localized degeneration with regional thickening of the medial
   tibial plateau and a decrease in attenuation consistent with
   proteoglycan (PG) depletion. Focal lesions were also observed and 3D
   volume calculated as an additional outcome metric.
   Conclusions: EPIC-mu CT was used to quantitatively assess joint
   degeneration in two distinct preclinical models. The MMT model showed
   similar features to human Osteoarthritis (OA), including localized
   lesion formation and PG loss, while the MIA model displayed extensive
   cartilage degeneration throughout the joint. EPIC-mu CT imaging provides
   a rapid and quantitative screening tool for preclinical evaluation of OA
   therapeutics. (C) 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Abstract = {{As the loadings of precious metals in surface-chemical systems continue
   to decrease for photo-and electro-catalysts for energy and environmental
   applications, the study of near-surface electronic and atomic structure
   in functional materials becomes critically important. Extremely small
   quantities of active elements, whether grown as clusters or ultrathin
   films, exhibit changes in catalytic activity that arise from both size
   effects and electron-transfer effects. These size and transfer effects
   can be related to increased propensity for oxidation of the metallic
   deposit, as well as to various changes in electrochemical performance
   such as durability or required overpotential for a given reaction. This
   work establishes a minimum threshold for Pt loading beyond which
   bulk-type electronic behavior may be expected. By iteratively growing
   atomic monolayers and multilayers using self-limited electrodeposition
   and studying these films using core-electron spectroscopy (X-ray
   absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), electrochemical
   methods and DFT-based computations the fundamental interactions that
   govern oxidation state and electron transfer near the surface of a Pt-Au
   bimetallic system have been explored. It has been shown that the Pt-Au
   system exhibits increased tendency for the Pt layer to remain cationic
   below a minimum threshold film thickness of two monolayers. At
   monodispersed levels of submonolayer coverage Pt exhibits deviated
   electronic structure, reactivity, and metal stability compared to films
   in excess of this minimum threshold thickness. At three monolayers Pt is
   thick enough to avoid the preference for cationicity and the resulting
   higher rates of metal dissolution, but thin enough to benefit from
   electron transfers from Au that assist in lowering the overpotentials
   for CO oxidation. This study shows the efficacy of a concerted method
   for the investigation of near-surface phenomena in multicomponent
   systems. By combining electrochemical and vacuum studies of
   solute-derived samples with advanced computational techniques, a
   multifaceted understanding of these architectures has been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We present integer programming models of the service network design
   problem faced by less-than-truckload (LTL) freight transportation
   carriers and a solution approach for the large-scale instances that
   result in practical applications. To accurately represent freight
   consolidation opportunities, the models use a fine discretization of
   time. Furthermore, the models simultaneously route freight and empty
   trailers and thus explicitly recognize the efficiencies presented by
   backhaul lanes. The solution approach can generate the traditional
   service network designs commonly used by LTL carriers but also enables
   the construction of designs that allow more flexibility, e. g., that
   allow freight routes to vary by day of week. An iterative improvement
   scheme is employed that searches a large neighborhood, each iteration
   using an integer program. Computational experiments using data from a
   large U. S. carrier demonstrate that the proposed modeling and solution
   approach has the potential to generate significant cost savings.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic jet actuators are investigated for rapidly maneuvering
   airfoils that are regulated by a closed-loop control system. To support
   active flow-control simulations performed here, the closed-loop system
   and vehicle dynamics are coupled with computational fluid dynamics.
   High-frequency sinusoidal pitching simulations with and without
   synthetic jet actuation indicate that the current synthetic jet
   actuators provide bidirectional change in aerodynamic forces during
   rapid maneuvers whose time scales are of the same order as the flow time
   scales. Responses of a wind-tunnel airfoil are well represented in the
   current simulations, which allows us to predict the response of the
   system for dynamic conditions representative of free flight. The control
   system is able to execute rapid free-flight maneuvers. It is observed
   that the controller is responding to small fluctuations caused by vortex
   shedding from the trailing-edge actuators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for defining a barycentric coordinate
   system on a k-objective Pareto frontier that is constructed from
   nondomination levels calculated over subsets of the objectives taken k -
   1 at a time. Unlike past approaches, these ``nondomination-level
   coordinates{''} are not limited by the dimensionality, convexity, or
   curvature of the frontier, and they have an inherent meaning as relative
   preferences for the competing objectives. This intuitive behavior makes
   the coordinates particularly useful as the basis for parametric models
   of the frontier and for conducting sensitivity studies and interactive
   trade-space exploration. The method is demonstrated on three
   mathematical example problems exhibiting different geometric properties
   and on a conceptual wing-sizing problem.}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo is a fast growing plant found worldwide that has high potential
   as an energy crop. This project evaluated the effectiveness of AFEX
   pretreatment for converting moso bamboo (Phyllostachys heterocycla var.
   pubescens) to fermentable sugars, both with and without pre-soaking in
   hydrogen peroxide. Pretreatment conditions including temperature, water
   loading, residence time, ammonia loading, and hydrogen peroxide loadings
   were varied to maximize hydrolysis yields. The optimal conditions for
   AFEX were 150 degrees C, 0.8 or 2.0 (w/w) water loading, 10-30 min
   residence time, and 2.0-5.0 (w/w) ammonia loading. The optimal
   conditions for H-AFEX were same AFEX conditions with 0.7-1.9 (w/w) 30\%
   (wt) hydrogen peroxide solutions loading. Using 15 FPU/g glucan
   cellulase and under optimal conditions, AFEX pretreatment achieved a
   theoretical sugars yield of 64.8-72.7\% and addition of hydrogen
   peroxide presoaking increased the yield to 83.4-92.1\%. It is about
   5-fold and 7-fold increase in sugars yield for AFEX-treated and
   H-AFEX-treated bamboo respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cochannel links in a Wireless LAN are separated across orthogonal time
   slots to avoid interference. With increasing density of links, time
   sharing the channel leads to severe capacity problems. In this paper, we
   identify a specific class of interference scenarios called asymmetric
   interference scenarios, where the nature of interference is different at
   the receivers of the concurrent signals. We show that, with appropriate
   handling, asymmetric interference allows each receiver to decode its
   intended reception successfully. We represent the signal combination at
   the receiver as a function f(c) and propose a solution called Symbiotic
   Coding (SC) such that f(c)(E-1(d(1); d(2)),E-2(d(1),d(2)) is equal to
   E-1(d(1),d(2)), where d(1) and d(2) are the intended and interfering
   data symbol sequences and E-1 is the encoder at sender 1 and E-2 at
   sender 2, respectively. SC, thus, enables successful simultaneous
   cochannel transmissions even if they result in a collision. The
   performance of SC scales with the number of interfering links achieving
   median throughput improvements of 30 and 86 percent over time sharing
   with two and three interfering links, respectively. We address
   fundamental challenges in realizing SC including synchronization, coding
   algorithms, extensions to different modulations. We also implement SC on
   software defined radios and demonstrate its practical feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{We present the field programmable array of analog and digital devices
   (FPAADD) as a novel implementation of a field programmable mixed-signal
   array (FPMA). The FPAADD is a hybrid combination of a field programmable
   analog array (FPAA) and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Unlike
   other FPMAs where the FPGA and FPAA portions are kept separate, this
   architecture closely integrates the two in a fine-grained interleaved
   array. Instead of using hard-coded data converters, the FPAADD
   synthesizes data converters out of its reconfigurable fabric. The analog
   and digital portions share a common global interconnect. Floating gate
   (FG) transistors are used as the switch and memory elements of the chip,
   providing better switch performance and power over traditional static
   random-access memory-based approaches. The precise programmability of
   the FG switches also allows for computation to take place in the
   interconnect. These key differences make the FPAADD much more general
   purpose than previous FPMA architectures. The FPAADD consists of 27 x 8
   array of 108 digital and 108 analog tiles and peripheral circuitry on 5
   x 5 mm(2) die fabricated in a 0.35-mu m CMOS process, and contains more
   than 130 000 FG transistors.}},

Abstract = {{Test case generation is among the most labour-intensive tasks in
   software testing. It also has a strong impact on the effectiveness and
   efficiency of software testing. For these reasons, it has been one of
   the most active research topics in software testing for several decades,
   resulting in many different approaches and tools. This paper presents an
   orchestrated survey of the most prominent techniques for automatic
   generation of software test cases, reviewed in self-standing sections.
   The techniques presented include: (a) structural testing using symbolic
   execution, (b) model-based testing, (c) combinatorial testing, (d)
   random testing and its variant of adaptive random testing, and (e)
   search-based testing. Each section is contributed by world-renowned
   active researchers on the technique, and briefly covers the basic ideas
   underlying the method, the current state of the art, a discussion of the
   open research problems, and a perspective of the future development of
   the approach. As a whole, the paper aims at giving an introductory,
   up-to-date and (relatively) short overview of research in automatic test
   case generation, while ensuring a comprehensive and authoritative
   treatment. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulated emission depletion (STED) can achieve optical
   superresolution, with the optical diffraction limit broken by the
   suppression on the periphery of the fluorescent focal spot. Previously,
   it is generally experimentally accepted that there exists an inverse
   square root relationship with the STED power and the resolution, but
   with arbitrary coefficients in expression. In this paper, we have
   removed the arbitrary coefficients by exploring the relationship between
   the STED power and the achievable resolution from vector optical theory
   for the widely used 0-2 pi vortex phase modulation. Electromagnetic
   fields of the focal region of a high numerical aperture objective are
   calculated and approximated into polynomials of radius in the focal
   plane, and analytical expression of resolution as a function of the STED
   intensity has been derived. As a result, the resolution can be estimated
   directly from the measurement of the saturation power of the dye and the
   STED power applied in the region of high STED power. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{Objective: Forces acting on mitral annular devices in the setting of
   ischemic mitral regurgitation are currently unknown. The aim of this
   study was to quantify the cyclic forces that result from mitral annular
   contraction in a chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation ovine model and
   compare them with forces measured previously in healthy animals.
   Methods: A novel force transducer was implanted in the mitral annulus of
   6 ovine subjects 8 weeks after an inferior left ventricle infarction
   that produced progressive, severe chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation.
   Septal-lateral and transverse forces were measured continuously for
   cardiac cycles reaching a peak left ventricular pressure of 90, 125,
   150, 175, and 200 mm Hg. Cyclic forces and their rate of change during
   isovolumetric contraction were quantified and compared with those
   measured in healthy animals.
   Results: Animals with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation exhibited a
   mean mitral regurgitation grade of 2.3 +/- 0.5. Ischemic mitral
   regurgitation was observed to decrease significantly septal-lateral
   forces at each level of left ventricular pressure (P < .01). Transverse
   forces were consistently lower in the ischemic mitral regurgitation
   group despite not reaching statistical significance. The rate of change
   of these forces during isovolumetric contraction was found to increase
   significantly with peak left ventricular pressure (P < .005), but did
   not differ significantly between animal groups.
   Conclusions: Mitral annular forces were measured for the first time in a
   chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation animal model. Our findings
   demonstrated an inferior left ventricular infarct to decrease
   significantly cyclic septal-lateral forces while modestly lowering those
   in the transverse. The measurement of these forces and their variation
   with left ventricular pressure contributes significantly to the
   development of mitral annular ischemic mitral regurgitation devices.}},

Title = {{Beam pattern improvement by compensating array nonuniformities in a
   guided wave phased array}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple data processing algorithm which can improve
   the performance of a uniform circular array based on guided wave
   transducers. The algorithm, being intended to be used with the
   delay-and-sum beamformer, effectively eliminates the effects of
   nonuniformities that can significantly degrade the beam pattern.
   Nonuniformities can arise intrinsically from the array geometry when the
   circular array is transformed to a linear array for beam steering and
   extrinsically from unequal conditions of transducers such as
   element-to-element variations of sensitivity and directivity. The
   effects of nonuniformities are compensated by appropriately imposing
   weight factors on the elements in the projected linear array. Different
   cases are simulated, where the improvements of the beam pattern,
   especially the level of the highest sidelobe, are clearly seen, and
   related issues are discussed. An experiment is performed which uses A0
   mode Lamb waves in a steel plate, to demonstrate the usefulness of the
   proposed method. The discrepancy between theoretical and experimental
   beam patterns is explained by accounting for near-field effects.}},

Title = {{Passive wireless antenna sensor for strain and crack
   sensing-electromagnetic modeling, simulation, and testing}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This research investigates a passive wireless antenna sensor designed
   for strain and crack sensing. When the antenna experiences deformation,
   the antenna shape changes, causing a shift in the electromagnetic
   resonance frequency of the antenna. A radio frequency identification
   (RFID) chip is adopted for antenna signal modulation, so that a wireless
   reader can easily distinguish the backscattered sensor signal from
   unwanted environmental reflections. The RFID chip captures its operating
   power from an interrogation electromagnetic wave emitted by the reader,
   which allows the antenna sensor to be passive (battery-free). This paper
   first reports the latest simulation results on radiation patterns,
   surface current density, and electromagnetic field distribution. The
   simulation results are followed with experimental results on the strain
   and crack sensing performance of the antenna sensor. Tensile tests show
   that the wireless antenna sensor can detect small strain changes lower
   than 20 mu epsilon, and can perform well at large strains higher than 10
   000 mu epsilon. With a high-gain reader antenna, the wireless
   interrogation distance can be increased up to 2.1 m. Furthermore, an
   array of antenna sensors is capable of measuring the strain distribution
   in close proximity. During emulated crack and fatigue crack tests, the
   antenna sensor is able to detect the growth of a small crack.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing is a fundamental function in cognitive radio networks
   for detecting the presence of primary users in licensed bands. The
   detection performance may be considerably compromised due to multipath
   fading and shadowing. To resolve this issue, cooperative sensing is an
   effective approach to combat channel impairments by cooperation of
   secondary users. This approach, however, incurs overhead such as delay
   for reporting local decisions and the increase of control traffic. In
   this paper, a reinforcement learning-based cooperative sensing (RLCS)
   method is proposed to address the cooperation overhead problem and
   improve cooperative gain in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. The
   proposed algorithm is proven to converge and capable of (1) finding the
   optimal set of cooperating neighbors with minimum control traffic, (2)
   minimizings the overall cooperative sensing delay, (3) selecting
   independent users for cooperation under correlated shadowing, and (4)
   excluding unreliable users and data from cooperation. Simulation results
   show that the RLCS method reduces the overhead of cooperative sensing
   while effectively improving the detection performance to combat
   correlated shadowing. Moreover, it adapts to environmental change and
   maintains comparable performance under the impact of primary user
   activity, user movement, user reliability, and control channel fading.}},

   concentrated through reverse osmosis. The water recovered is mostly
   recycled. By far, the most important economic variable is the value of
   the glucose. However, even if the glucose is assumed to be of no value

Abstract = {{Production of hydrogen (H-2) by splitting water using the electrolysis
   effect is a potential source of clean and renewable energy. However, it
   usually requires an external power source to drive the oxidation or

   development of this technology. Here, we fabricated a hybrid energy cell
   that is an integration of a triboelectric nanogenerator, a
   thermoelectric cell, and a solar cell, which can be used to
   simultaneously/individually harvest mechanical, thermal, and/or solar
   energies. The power output of the hybrid energy cell can be directly
   used for splitting water without an external power source. The volume of
   the produced H-2 has a linear relationship with the splitting time at a
   production speed of 4 x 10(-4) mL s(-1). Moreover, the produced energies
   can also be stored in a Li-ion battery for water splitting as well as

Abstract = {{Synthesis of S-doped activated carbons (ACs) by carbonization and
   simultaneous activation of S-based polymers was found to be an efficient
   route to produce porous carbons for double layer capacitors (EDLCs) with
   high specific energy and power densities combined with low
   self-discharge. Here we investigate for the first time the
   processing-structure-property relationships related to the formation of
   polythiophene-derived ACs for EDLC applications. Sulfide bridges present
   in the polymer precursor were found to depress the shrinkage of the
   smallest micropores during the carbonization process and allow for the
   enhanced ion transport within the produced AC electrodes. The cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) measurements on S-doped ACs produced at 800 and 850
   degrees C showed high specific capacitance (up to similar to 200 F
   g(-1)) and no significant self-discharge in neutral aqueous
   electrolytes. More importantly, these capacitance values remained
   virtually identical for a sweep rate increasing from 1 to 50 mV s(-1).
   The observed capacitance retention is quite remarkable for thick
   electrodes of similar to 200 mu m and a large AC particle size of 10-100
   mu m. It indicates great potential of the proposed synthesis technology
   for EDLCs operating at high frequencies and high currents. In the course
   of our systematic studies of AC performance in different electrolytes we
   found a strong correlation between the large pseudocapacitance and the
   significant self-discharge in ACs. We harness the difference between the
   characteristic times required to establish a double layer and that of
   the pseudocapacitive redox reactions and propose a simple method to
   estimate the fraction of pseudocapacitance. The proposed method is
   particularly valuable in cases when CV measurements do not show clear
   characteristic reduction-oxidation peaks.}},

Abstract = {{The fields of compressed sensing (CS) and matrix completion have shown
   that high-dimensional signals with sparse or low-rank structure can be
   effectively projected into a low-dimensional space (for efficient
   acquisition or processing) when the projection operator achieves a
   stable embedding of the data by satisfying the Restricted Isometry
   Property (RIP). It has also been shown that such stable embeddings can
   be achieved for general Riemannian submanifolds when random
   orthoprojectors are used for dimensionality reduction. Due to
   computational costs and system constraints, the CS community has
   recently explored the RIP for structured random matrices (e. g., random
   convolutions, localized measurements, deterministic constructions). The
   main contribution of this paper is to show that any matrix satisfying
   the RIP (i.e., providing a stable embedding for sparse signals) can be
   used to construct a stable embedding for manifold-modeled signals by
   randomizing the column signs and paying reasonable additional factors in
   the number of measurements, thereby generalizing previous stable
   manifold embedding results beyond unstructured random matrices. We
   demonstrate this result with several new constructions for stable
   manifold embeddings using structured matrices. This result allows
   advances in efficient projection schemes for sparse signals to be
   immediately applied to manifold signal models.}},

   characteristic with an overall frequency drift as low as 83 ppm over the
   industrial temperature range (-40 degrees C to 80 degrees C). Besides a

Title = {{Fundamental spray and combustion measurements of soy methyl-ester
   biodiesel}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{373-390}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Although biodiesel has begun to penetrate the fuel market, its effect on
   injection processes, combustion and emission formation under diesel
   engine conditions remains somewhat unclear. Typical exhaust measurements
   from engines running biodiesel indicate that particulate matter, carbon
   monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons are decreased, whereas nitrogen oxide
   emissions tend to be increased. However, these observations are the
   result of complex interactions between physical and chemical processes
   occurring in the combustion chamber, for which understanding is still
   needed. To characterize and decouple the physical and chemical
   influences of biodiesel on spray mixing, ignition, combustion and soot
   formation, a soy methyl-ester (SME) biodiesel is injected into a
   constant-volume combustion facility under diesel-like operating
   conditions. A range of optical diagnostics is performed, comparing
   biodiesel to a conventional \#2 diesel at the same injection and ambient
   conditions. Schlieren high-speed imaging shows virtually the same
   vapour-phase penetration for the two fuels, while simultaneous
   Mie-scatter imaging shows that the maximum liquid-phase penetration of
   biodiesel is higher than diesel. Differences in the liquid-phase
   penetration are expected because of the different boiling-point
   temperatures of the two fuels. However, the different liquid-phase
   penetration does not affect overall mixing rate and downstream
   vapour-phase penetration because each fuel spray has similar momentum
   and spreading angle. For the biodiesel and diesel samples used in this
   study, the ignition delay and lift-off length are only slightly less for
   biodiesel compared to diesel, consistent with the fuel cetane number (51
   for biodiesel, 46 for diesel). Because of the similarity in lift-off
   length, the differences in equivalence ratio distribution at the
   lift-off length are mainly affected by the oxygen content of the fuels.
   For biodiesel, the equivalence ratio is reduced, which, along with the
   fuel molecular structure and oxygen content, significantly affects soot
   formation downstream. Spatially resolved soot volume fraction
   measurements obtained by combining line-of-sight laser extinction
   measurements with planar laser-induced incandescence imaging show that
   the soot concentration can be reduced by an order of magnitude for
   biodiesel. These integrated measurements of spray mixing, combustion and
   quantitative soot concentration provide new validation data for the
   development of computational fluid dynamics spray, combustion and soot
   formation models suitable for the latest biofuels.}},

Abstract = {{A modal decomposition method for computing the solution to an
   eddy-current problem is presented. Modes are computed using the finite
   element method and the modes produced are simplified to a magnetic
   polarizability dyadic in the form of a singularity expansion. This
   reduced form is a very compact and easily-implemented model for the
   scatterer's reaction to an arbitrary magnetic field. Due to scaling
   properties, a single model can be applied to scatterers with different
   sizes and conductivities. The modal decomposition method could be used
   to compute a variety of parameterized simple models for canonical shapes
   to assist in algorithm design for clutter discrimination in buried
   object detection systems. The method is verified using analytically
   known formulas for the dyadic of a sphere and a loop. The code is then
   used to predict the behavior of cylinders with arbitrary conductivity
   and size, showing excellent agreement with a set of measured cylinders.

Abstract = {{The intermetallic compound (IMC) evolution in Cu pad/Sn-Ag-Cu solder
   interface and Sn-Ag-Cu solder/Ni pad interface was investigated using
   thermal shock experiments with 100-mu m-pitch flip-chip assemblies. The
   experiments show that low standoff height of solder joints and high
   thermomechanical stress play a great role in the interfacial IMC
   microstructure evolution under thermal shock, and strong cross-reaction
   of pad metallurgies is evident in the intermetallic growth. Furthermore,
   by comparing the IMC growth during thermal aging and thermal shock, it
   was found that thermal shock accelerates IMC growth and that kinetic
   models based on thermal aging experiments underpredict IMC growth in
   thermal shock experiments. Therefore, new diffusion kinetic parameters
   were determined for the growth of (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 using thermal shock
   experiments, and the Cu diffusion coefficient through the IMC layer was
   calculated to be 0.2028 mu m(2)/h under thermal shock. Finite-element
   models also show that the solder stresses are higher under thermal
   shock, which could explain why the IMC growth is faster and greater
   under thermal shock cycling as opposed to thermal aging.}},

Abstract = {{The difficulty of mixing chemically incompatible substances-in
   particular macromolecules and colloidal particles-is a canonical problem
   limiting advances in fields ranging from health care to materials
   engineering(1-4). Although the self-assembly of chemically different
   moieties has been demonstrated in coordination complexes, supramolecular
   structures, and colloidal lattices among other systems(5-18), the
   mechanisms of mixing largely rely on specific interfacing of chemically,
   physically or geometrically complementary objects. Here, by taking
   advantage of the steric repulsion between brush-like polymers tethered
   to surface-active species, we obtained long-range arrays of perfectly
   mixed macromolecules with a variety of polymer architectures and a wide
   range of chemistries without the need of encoding specific
   complementarity. The net repulsion arises from the significant increase
   in the conformational entropy of the brush-like polymers with increasing
   distance between adjacent macromolecules at fluid interfaces. This
   entropic-templating assembly strategy enables long-range patterning of
   thin films on sub-100 nm length scales.}},

   the framework of common quadratic Lyapunov functions from the theory of

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Technological innovations have driven the advancement of the surgical
   treatment of movement disorders, from the invention of the stereotactic
   frame to the adaptation of deep brain stimulation (DBS). Along these
   lines, this review will describe recent advances in inserting
   neuromodulation modalities, including DBS, to the target, and in the
   delivery of therapy at the target. Recent radiological advances are
   altering the way that DBS leads are targeted and inserted, by refining
   the ability to visualize the subcortical targets using high-field
   strength magnetic resonance imaging and other innovations, such as
   diffusion tensor imaging, and the development of novel targeting devices
   enabling purely anatomical implantations without the need for
   neurophysiological monitoring. New portable computed tomography scanners
   also are facilitating lead implantation without monitoring, as well as
   improving radiological verification of DBS lead location. Advances in
   neurophysiological mapping include efforts to develop automatic target
   verification algorithms, and probabilistic maps to guide target
   selection. The delivery of therapy at the target is being improved by
   the development of the next generation of internal pulse generators
   (IPGs). These include constant current devices that mitigate the
   variability introduced by impedance changes of the stimulated tissue
   and, in the near future, devices that deliver novel stimulation patterns
   with improved efficiency. Closed-loop adaptive IPGs are being tested,
   which may tailor stimulation to ongoing changes in the nervous system,
   reflected in biomarkers continuously recorded by the devices.
   Finer-grained DBS leads, in conjunction with new IPGs and advanced
   programming tools, may offer improved outcomes via current steering
   algorithms. Finally, even thermocoagulation-essentially replaced by
   DBS-is being advanced by new minimally-invasive approaches that may
   improve this therapy for selected patients in whom it may be preferred.
   Functional neurosurgery has a history of being driven by technological
   innovation, a tradition that continues into its future.}},

Abstract = {{In order to meet stringent temperature-control requirements in a
   high-speed airflow wind tunnel (HAWT) for thermal simulation under
   complicated work conditions such as thermal strength experiment of aero
   engine blade and dynamic calibration of high temperature thermal
   coupler, this paper proposes a novel cascade fuzzy-PID (C-Fuzzy-PID)
   compound control method for regulating the fuel-oil flow rate in the
   inner loop and temperature in the outer loop. The mathematical models
   that characterize the dynamics of the heat airflow temperature in the
   combustor and the fuel-oil flow rate for combustion are derived, upon
   which the improved PID control laws for the inner and outer loops are
   described. The former employs a fuzzy-PID controller with a predictor
   for controlling flow rate in the inner loop, which effectively overcomes
   influences according to its characteristics of large inertia and
   transport lag in fuel-oil supply system on the temperature responses.
   The latter combines disturbance compensation and a fuzzy-PID feedback
   law to suppress influences due to factors such as change in work
   conditions, disturbances, and time-varying parameter variations. The
   C-Fuzzy-PID method has been numerically investigated by comparing
   simulation results against two traditional PID-based methods, as well as
   experimentally validated confirming that the proposed control algorithm
   has strong robustness and excellent adaptability for temperature control
   of an HAWT.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2931-2945}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new low-complexity true-motion estimation (TME)
   algorithm is proposed for video processing applications, such as
   motion-compensated temporal frame interpolation (MCTFI) or
   motion-compensated frame rate up-conversion (MCFRUC). Regular motion
   estimation, which is often used in video coding, aims to find the motion
   vectors (MVs) to reduce the temporal redundancy, whereas TME aims to
   track the projected object motion as closely as possible. TME is
   obtained by imposing implicit and/or explicit smoothness constraints on
   the block-matching algorithm. To produce better quality-interpolated
   frames, the dense motion field at interpolation time is obtained for
   both forward and backward MVs; then, bidirectional motion compensation
   using forward and backward MVs is applied by mixing both elegantly.
   Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm for MCTFI is
   demonstrated against recently proposed methods and smoothness constraint
   optical flow employed by a professional video production suite.
   Experimental results show that the quality of the interpolated frames
   using the proposed method is better when compared with the MCFRUC
   techniques.}},

   R-KMC, rates or propensities are interval estimates instead of precise

   probability is developed. The weak convergence of the multi-event
   algorithm towards the traditional KMC is demonstrated with a generalized

Title = {{Generalized type III internal stress from interfaces, triple junctions

Abstract = {{The microstructure in polycrystalline materials consists of four types
   of geometric objects: grain cells, grain boundaries, triple junctions
   and vertex points. Each of them contributes to internal stress
   differently. Due to experimental limitations, the internal stresses
   associated with the microstructural components are difficult to acquire
   directly, particularly for polycrystalline materials with nanometerscale
   grain sizes. Using newly developed computational methods, we obtained
   the type III internal stress associated with each of these
   microstructural objects in a stress-free nanocrystalline Cu. We found
   significant variation of the internal stresses from grain to grain, and
   their magnitudes descended in the order of vertex point, triple
   junction, grain boundary and grain cell. We also examined the effect of
   grain size and temperature. The change in the internal stresses inside
   the grains is found to follow a scaling relation of Ad(-x), using the
   mean grain diameter d from our results. For pressure, we found x = 1 and
   the effective interface stress A similar to 1N m(-1), and for shear
   stress x = 0.75 and A similar to 14.12 N m(-1). On the other hand, the
   directly calculated interface stress is about 0.32-0.35 GPa for
   hydrostatic pressure and 12.45-12.60 GPa for von Mises shear stress. We
   discuss issues in treating the two-dimensional interface stress and
   one-dimensional triple junction line tension in nanocrystalline
   materials, as well as the potential impact of the type III internal
   stress on mechanical behavior of poly- and nano-crytalline materials.

Abstract = {{Propionic acid (PA) is an important chemical building block and is
   widely applied for organic synthesis, food, feedstuff, and
   pharmaceuticals. To date, the strains that can efficiently produce PA
   have included Propionibacterium thoenii, P. freudenreichii, and P.
   acidipropionici. In this report, we show that P. jensenii ATCC 4868 is
   also able to produce PA in much higher yields than the previously
   reported strains. To further improve the production capacity, a P.
   jensenii-Escherichia coli shuttle vector was developed for the metabolic
   engineering of P. jensenii. Specifically, a 6.9-kb endogenous plasmid,
   pZGX01, was isolated from P. acidipropionici ATCC 4875 and sequenced.
   Since the sequencing analysis indicated that pZGX01 could encode 11
   proteins, the transcriptional levels of the corresponding genes were
   also investigated. Then, a P. jensenii-Escherichia coli shuttle vector
   was constructed using the pZGX01 plasmid, the E. coli pUC18 plasmid, and
   a chloramphenicol resistance gene. Interestingly, not only could the
   developed shuttle vector be transformed into P. jensenii ATCC 4868 and
   4870, but it also could be transformed into freudenreichii ATCC 6207
   subspecies of P. freudenreichii. Finally, the glycerol dehydrogenase
   gene (gldA) from Klebsiella pneumoniae was expressed in P. jensenii ATCC
   4868 with the constructed shuttle vector. In a 3-liter batch culture,
   the PA production by the engineered P. jensenii ATCC 4868 strain reached
   28.23 +/- 1.0 g/liter, which was 26.07\% higher than that produced by
   the wild-type strain (22.06 +/- 1.2 g/liter). This result indicated that
   the constructed vector can be used a useful tool for metabolic
   engineering of P. jensenii.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a software control method that maximizes the
   sensing rate of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that are solely powered
   by ambient RF power. Unlike all other energy harvesting WSN systems,
   RF-powered systems present new challenges for energy management. A WSN
   node repeatedly charges and discharges at short intervals, depending on
   the energy intake. Typically in energy harvesting systems, a capacitor
   is used for energy storage because of its efficient charge and discharge
   performance and infinite recharge cycles. When the charging time is too
   short, a node is more likely to experience an energy shortage. On the
   contrary, if it is too long, more energy is lost because of leakage in
   the capacitor. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive duty cycle
   control scheme optimized for RF energy harvesting. This method maximizes
   the sensing rate by taking into account the leakage problem, a factor
   that has never been previously studied in this context. Our control
   scheme improves the efficiency by aggregate evaluation of operation
   reliability and leakage reduction.}},

Abstract = {{One-fourth of construction industry fatalities are caused by worker
   collisions with construction equipment. Nonvisible areas (blind spots)
   for equipment operators are contributing factors to many of these
   fatalities because equipment operators are unable to see ground
   personnel at certain locations around their equipment. Presented are the
   design and validation of a unique technique for measuring blind spots by
   using laser scanning data. The work demonstrates how the design of
   construction equipment impacts the visibility of its operator. The
   contribution of the developed technique to the body of knowledge is that
   it can precisely evaluate and compare different equipment models and
   design characteristics. The blind spot measurement data for several
   similar pieces of equipment provides design suggestions that increase
   operator visibility. By increasing operator visibility through advanced
   equipment design, safety can be promoted on construction sites and in
   any other work environment, particularly with nearby ground workforce

Abstract = {{Seismic performance evaluation of wharf structures constitutes the core
   of the vulnerability assessment of seaport infrastructure exposed to
   seismic events. Because this performance will depend on complex
   interactions between the surrounding potentially liquefiable soils and
   wharf foundation and structure, detailed and careful implementation of
   advanced modeling techniques is needed. These models are required to
   capture such highly nonlinear phenomena as permanent seaward deformation
   of embankment soils, soil-structure interaction in liquefiable soils,
   spread of plasticity in prestressed piles, and force-deformation of
   pile-deck connections. This study utilizes such modeling approaches to
   investigate the three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear response of a typical
   pile-supported container wharf structure in liquefiable embankment
   soils. Input excitations for this analysis consist of embankment soil
   deformations for a far-field and an impulsive near-field ground motion.
   These excitations are derived using two-dimensional (2D) plane strain
   free-filed analyses for transverse (seaward-landward) and vertical
   directions and a spectral matching technique for the longitudinal
   (parallel to shoreline) direction. Results of these 3D analyses show
   that the oscillating component of embankment deformations is the primary
   contributor to the maximum response of the piles sections and pile-deck
   connections, and that effects of permanent deformations of the
   embankment soil are much smaller. The analysis results also demonstrate
   the importance of the structure's 3D response characteristics, including
   longitudinal and torsional responses of the structure that are
   comparable to the transverse wharf responses during large amplitude
   oscillating embankment deformations owing to impulsive near-field
   motions. These important 3D response characteristics are not captured by
   more typical 2D wharf response analyses. Detailed comparisons of the
   responses of the 3D wharf model to corresponding responses from the 2D
   model of the wharf are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Computing systems should be designed to exploit parallelism in order to
   improve performance. In general, a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) can
   provide more parallelism than a CPU (Central Processing Unit), resulting
   in the wide usage of heterogeneous computing systems that utilize both
   the CPU and the GPU together. In the heterogeneous computing systems,
   the efficiency of the scheduling scheme, which selects the device to
   execute the application between the CPU and the GPU, is one of the most
   critical factors in determining the performance. This paper proposes a
   dynamic scheduling scheme for the selection of the device between the
   CPU and the GPU to execute the application based on the
   estimated-execution-time information. The proposed scheduling scheme
   enables the selection between the CPU and the GPU to minimize the
   completion time, resulting in a better system performance, even though
   it requires the training period to collect the execution history.
   According to our simulations, the proposed estimated-execution-time
   scheduling can improve the utilization of the CPU and the GPU compared
   to existing scheduling schemes, resulting in reduced execution time and
   enhanced energy efficiency of heterogeneous computing systems.}},

Abstract = {{A bioartifical pancreas (BAP) remains a promising approach for treating
   insulin-dependent diabetes. Several obstacles to the clinical
   implementation of a BAP remain, including hypoxia following
   implantation. Within native pancreatic islets, CXCL12 and glucagon-like
   peptide-1 (GLP-1) act in a paracrine fashion to promote the survival,
   function, and proliferation of -cells. This work sought to investigate
   if the presentation of CXCL12 and delivery of a GLP-1 receptor analog,
   Exendin-4 (Ex-4), alone and in combination, conferred pro-survival and
   insulinotropic effects on an encapsulated -cell line, TC-tet, cultured
   under hypoxic conditions of 7.6mmHg O2. Our findings indicate that
   presentation of CXCL12 in the encapsulation matrix completely abrogated
   apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Delivery of Ex-4 increased insulin
   secretion rate under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and
   additionally reduced apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore,
   presentation of CXCL12 combined with Ex-4 delivery significantly
   increased insulin secretion rate under hypoxic conditions compared to
   delivery of Ex-4 alone. These findings demonstrate that the presentation
   of CXCL12 combined with the delivery of Ex-4 may constitute a promising
   strategy for supporting -cell function and survival following
   transplantation. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 2292-2300. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Presence of retained austenite in two-phase steels can have a
   significant effect on the response of the material. The current
   state-of-the-art in multi-phase modeling of polycrystalline plasticity
   has limits on scaling, explicit phase modeling, and tracking multiple
   plasticity types. To address these issues, a hybrid material model is
   developed for high-carbon steels. The model can account for crystal
   plasticity of martensite and stress-assisted transformation from
   austenite to martensite in dual-phase high-carbon steel. The parameters
   of the model are calibrated to experimental stress-strain and volumetric
   transformation strain data. The combination of scalability and multiple
   phase representation gives a useful tool for the investigation of
   two-phase high-carbon steel behavior.}},

Title = {{Recovery from hind limb ischemia enhances rhBMP-2-mediated segmental
   bone defect repair in a rat composite injury model}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Although severe extremity trauma is often inclusive of skeletal and
   vascular damage in combination, segmental bone defect repair with
   concomitant vascular injury has yet to be experimentally investigated.
   To this end, we developed a novel rat composite limb injury model by
   combining a critically-sized segmental bone defect with
   surgically-induced hind limb ischemia (HLI). Unilateral 8 mm femoral
   defects were created alone (BD) or in combination with HLI (BD + HLI),
   and all defects were treated with rhBMP-2 via a hybrid biomaterial
   delivery system. Based on reported clinical and experimental
   observations on the importance of vascular networks in bone repair, we
   hypothesized that HLI would impair bone regeneration. Interestingly, the
   BD + HLI group displayed improved radiographic bridging, and
   quantitative micro-CT analysis revealed enhanced bone regeneration as
   early as week 4 (p < 0.01) that was sustained through week 12 (p <
   0.001) and confirmed histologically. This effect was observed in two
   independent studies and at two different doses of rhBMP-2. Micro-CT
   angiography was used to quantitatively evaluate vascular networks at
   week 12 in both the thigh and the regenerated bone defect. No
   differences were found between groups in total blood vessel volume in
   the thigh, but clear differences in morphology were present as the BD +
   HLI group possessed a more interconnected network of smaller diameter
   vessels (p < 0.001). Accordingly, while the overall thigh vessel volume
   was comparable between groups, the contributions to vessel volume based
   on vessel diameter differed significantly. Despite this evidence of a
   robust neovascular response in the thigh of the BD + HLI group,
   differences were not observed between groups for bone defect blood
   vessel volume or morphology. In total, our results demonstrate that a
   transient ischemic insult and the subsequent recovery response to HLI
   significantly enhanced BMP-2-mediated segmental bone defect repair,
   providing additional complexity to the relationship between vascular
   tissue networks and bone healing. Ultimately, a better understanding of
   the coupling mechanisms may reveal important new strategies for
   promoting bone healing in challenging clinical scenarios. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The low-shear viscosities of new oil and used (degraded) oil were

   generated over a range of shear stress important to EHL film forming.
   Mechanical shear degradation only affected the viscosity at low shear
   stress while the viscosity at high stress remained unchanged. A recently
   published film thickness equation for double-Newtonian shear-thinning,
   employing the measured rheology, predicts the surprising result that
   thickness of the EHL film was not changed by the degradation although
   the low-shear viscosities were reduced substantially. Colorimetric
   measurements of the film thicknesses validate the predictions. Concern
   over the permanent loss in viscosity due to degradation may be misplaced
   when addressing EHL films. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, magnesium hydroxide {[}Mg(OH)(2)] nanoparticles were
   successfully incorporated into ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
   (UHMWPE) to produce nanocomposite fibers with reduced flammability. To
   improve the dispersibility in processing solvent (decalin) and the
   compatibility with UHMWPE, the Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles were firstly
   modified with oleic acid. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   indicated that the oleic acid was covalently bonded on the surface of
   Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles and formed a coating layer. The modified
   Mg(OH)(2) could disperse evenly and stably in decalin. The
   UHMWPE/decalin solutions with different percentages of Mg(OH)(2) were
   gel-spun and then hot drawn to yield UHMWPE nanocomposite fibers. The
   addition of Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles altered the mechanical properties of
   the fibers by affecting their maximum draw ratio. High loading of the
   nanoparticles would decrease both strength and modulus of the fibers.
   The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis
   (DTA) under air flow demonstrated their flammability could be remarkably
   reduced. The starting thermal decomposition temperature was increased by
   30 degrees C. Their combustion peak temperatures were also increased
   significantly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of Sm (x) Tb1-x (TTA)(3)Phen (x = 1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1,
   0) complexes was synthesized by wet chemical method and characterized
   using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence
   spectroscopy. The IR absorption spectra indicate that
   alpha-thenoyltrifluoroacetone was coordinated to the rare earth ions and
   that chemical bonds were formed between rare earth ions and the nitrogen
   atoms in 1,10-Phenanthroline (Phen). The fluorescence spectra of the
   complexes indicate that the emission intensity of Sm3+ was enhanced by
   the addition of substitutive Tb3+. These data show that not only the
   ligands (TTA and Phen) but also Tb3+ could absorb and transmit energy to
   Sm3+ in the complexes. Formation of dual-core complexes appears to be
   responsible for co-fluorescence, which can greatly promote the
   illuminant ability of Sm (TTA)(3)Phen complex. After further
   encapsulation by SiO2, the Sm (x) Tb1-x (TTA)(3)Phen@SiO2 core-shell
   structure was very stable to UV light.}},

Abstract = {{The stator turn-to-turn short circuit is an important type of fault in
   automotive claw-pole generators. In a typical vehicle electric power
   system, the built-in rectifier of the generator makes it difficult to
   access the ac current or voltage information, rendering conventional
   sequence-component-based fault-detection methods useless. To detect such
   fault using only the available sensor information, a dynamic model of
   the claw-pole generator with stator turn faults is derived in this paper
   to analyze how the fault would interact with the connected battery and
   the static full-bridge rectifier and how it would affect the generator's
   output voltage and current. It is found that, in the rectified generator
   output current, the harmonic at one-third of the rectifier ripple
   frequency is a robust signature of the stator turn fault. The
   performance of the stator turn-fault detector is demonstrated by
   extensive experimental results. Although the fault detector is
   originally proposed for claw-pole generators, it is also applicable to
   most polyphase ac generators with a dc-link rectifier.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a 3D microstructure of a porous Ni-YSZ composite is
   reconstructed using a recently developed Monte Carlo methodology. The 3D
   reconstruction starts by analyzing 2D SEM micrographs of real composite
   materials, which yield initial nucleation sites for different phases.
   The so-called cellular automaton algorithm, which is observed in insect
   colonies and bacteria growth in nature, controls growth kinetics of the
   initial nuclei. After successful growth and completion of the
   reconstruction process, FEM simulations are applied to characterize
   elastic and thermal properties of the reconstructed material. A porous
   Ni-YSZ composite reconstructed by this method shows mechanical behavior
   in between full isotropic and full orthotropic with an average Young's
   moduli of 17 GPa at room temperature and 10.2 GPa at 1000 degrees C,
   which are consistent with experimentally reported values. The variation
   in effective shear and Poisson's moduli as a function of temperature is
   also studied. Thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient of
   the digital material are derived as functions of temperature; revealing
   a relatively isotropic property in thermal conductivity and an increase
   in anisotropy in thermal expansion coefficient by increasing
   temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this research work a new hybrid approach to spatio-temporal seismic
   clustering is proposed. The method builds upon a novel density based
   clustering scheme that explicitly takes into account earthquake's
   magnitude during the density estimation. The new density based
   clustering algorithm considers both time and spatial information during
   cluster formation. Therefore clusters lie in a spatio-temporal space. A
   hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm acts upon the identified
   clusters after dropping the time information in order to come up only
   with the spatial description of seismic events. The approach is
   demonstrated using data from the vicinity of the Hellenic seismic arc in
   order to enable its comparison with some of the state-of-the-art
   distinct seismic region identification methodologies. The presented
   results indicate that the combination of the two clustering stages could
   be potentially used for an automatic definition of major seismic
   sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{213}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with arousal
   dysregulation, and alterations of amygdala activity in response to
   emotional arousal have previously been reported. However, voluntary
   regulation of emotional affect, enabling appropriate neural response to
   different streams of stimuli, must also engage prefrontal regions, yet
   the impact of PCE on these prefrontal mechanisms has not been
   investigated. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of
   ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) in the modulation of amygdala
   reactivity and the mediation of effective emotional regulation. Based on
   these findings, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the present study compared functional
   activations of the vPFC as well as its structural connectivity with the
   amygdala between groups of PCE and control adolescents. In a working
   memory task with emotional distracters, the PCE adolescents exhibited
   less capability of increasing their vPFC activation in response to
   increased memory load, which corresponded with their less suppressed
   amygdala activation. Reduced structural connectivity between the vPFC
   and the amygdala was also observed from DTI measurement in the PCE
   group. In addition, correlations between amygdala activation and (i)
   vPFC activation, as well as (ii) amygdala-vPFC structural connectivity,
   were observed in the control but not in the PCE group. These data
   complement previous findings of the impact of PCE on the activity of the
   amygdala and extend our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms
   underlying the effect of PCE on arousal dysregulation reported in human
   and animal studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   6x10(6) for 60 mu m radius and degrees 2 x 10(7) for 240 mu m radius).
   The coupling between the silicon nitride microresonator and the
   underneath silicon waveguide is based on evanescent coupling with
   silicon dioxide as buffer. Selective coupling to a desired radial mode
   of the silicon nitride microresonator is also achievable using a pulley
   coupling scheme. In this work, a 60-mu m-radius silicon nitride

Abstract = {{Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have been attracting increasing
   research interests due to their unique material properties. However, the
   lack of a reliable large-scale production method impedes their practical
   applications. Here a facile, efficient, and scalable method for the
   fabrication of high-concentration aqueous dispersion of MoS2 nanosheets
   using combined grinding and sonication is reported. The 26.7 +/- 0.7
   mg/mL concentration achieved is the highest concentration in an aqueous
   solution reported up to now. Grinding generates pure shear forces to
   detach the MoS2 layers from the bulk materials. Subsequent sonication
   further breaks larger crystallites into smaller crystallites, which
   promotes the dispersion of MoS2 nanosheets in ethanol/water solutions.
   The exfoliation process establishes a new paradigm in the top-down
   fabrication of 2D nanosheets in aqueous solution. In the meantime,
   MoS2-based sensing film produced using this approach has successfully
   demonstrated the feasibility of a low-cost and efficient NH3 gas sensor
   using inkjet printing as a viable method.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl orange (MO) can be degraded by a photocatalytic process using
   TiO2 under UV irradiation. The photo-generated holes and electrons can
   migrate to the surface of TiO2 particles and serve as redox sources that
   react with adsorbed reactants, leading to the formation of superoxide
   radical anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals involved in the
   oxidation of dye pollution. Here, we fabricated a
   polytetrafluoroethylene-Al based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   whose electric power output can be used for enhancing the
   photodegradation of MO with the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles, because
   the TENG generated electric field can effectively boost the separation
   and restrain the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes.
   Due to the photoelectrical coupling, the degradation percentages of MO
   for 120 min with and without TENG assistance are 76\% and 27\%,
   respectively. The fabricated TENGs have potential applications in
   wastewater treatment, water splitting, and pollution degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Porous sol-gel generated TiO2 nanocolloids and their corresponding
   oxynitrides TiO2-xNx are investigated to evaluate the effects that
   accompany doping with iron (Fe-II) ions at high doping concentrations.
   The introduction of Fe-II at higher concentrations leads to an
   anatase-to-rutile conversion at room temperature for the seeded
   oxynitride nanocolloids and to a less crystalline state in the
   subsurface and bulk as suggested by Raman spectroscopy. Combinations of
   core level and valence band photoelectron spectroscopy are correlated
   with the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
   demonstrate a facile charge transfer from Fe-II to Ti-IV, producing
   Ti-III and Fe-III, and subsequently the transformation of Fe-II + Ti-III
   to Fe-III + Ti-II. This process is associated with the detectable
   formation of Ti(III) and Ti(II) at the surface of the titania-based
   nanoparticles. With significant visible light absorption, the
   photocatalytic activities of the iron-seeded titania systems are
   comparable to that of the iron-doped oxynitride TiO2-xNx as a function
   of doping concentration. The observations reported herein suggest that
   the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation and the enhancement of
   electron transfer can control the visible-light catalytic activity
   within the doped nanopartides to form Fe-II/Fe-III-codoped TiO2
   nanocolloids.}},

Abstract = {{Skin immunization is effective against a number of infectious diseases,
   including smallpox and tuberculosis, but is difficult to administer.
   Here, we assessed the use of an easy-to-administer microneedle (MN)
   patch for skin vaccination using an inactivated rotavirus vaccine (IRV)
   in mice. Female inbred BALB/c mice in groups of six were immunized once
   in the skin using MN coated with 5 mu g or 0.5 mu g of inactivated
   rotavirus antigen or by intramuscular (IM) injection with 5 mu g or 0.5
   mu g of the same antigen, bled at 0 and 10 days, and exsanguinated at 28
   days. Rotavirus-specific IgG titers increased over time in sera of mice
   immunized with IRV using MN or IM injection. However, titers of IgG and
   neutralizing activity were generally higher in MN immunized mice than in
   IM immunized mice; the titers in mice that received 0.5 mu g of antigen
   with MN were comparable or higher than those that received 5 mu g of
   antigen IM, indicating dose sparing. None of the mice receiving
   negative-control, antigen-free MN had any IgG titers. In addition, MN
   immunization was at least as effective as IM administration in inducing
   a memory response of dendritic cells in the spleen. Our findings
   demonstrate that MN delivery can reduce the IRV dose needed to mount a
   robust immune response compared to IM injection and holds promise as a
   strategy for developing a safer and more effective rotavirus vaccine for
   use among children throughout the world. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Measles vaccination programs would benefit from delivery methods that
   decrease cost, simplify logistics, and increase safety. Conventional
   subcutaneous injection is limited by the need for skilled healthcare
   professionals to reconstitute and administer injections, and by the need
   for safe needle handling and disposal to reduce the risk of disease
   transmission through needle re-use and needlestick injury. Microneedles
   are micron-scale, solid needles coated with a dry formulation of vaccine
   that dissolves in the skin within minutes after patch application. By
   avoiding the use of hypodermic needles, vaccination using a microneedle
   patch could be carried out by minimally trained personnel with reduced
   risk of blood-borne disease transmission. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate measles vaccination using a microneedle patch to address some
   of the limitations of subcutaneous injection. Viability of vaccine virus
   dried onto a microneedle patch was stabilized by incorporation of the
   sugar, trehalose, and loss of viral titer was less than 1
   log(10)(TCID50) after storage for at least 30 days at room temperature.
   Microneedle patches were then used to immunize cotton rats with the
   Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine strain. Vaccination using microneedles
   at doses equaling the standard human dose or one-fifth the human dose
   generated neutralizing antibody levels equivalent to those of a
   subcutaneous immunization at the same dose. These results show that
   measles vaccine can be stabilized on microneedles and that vaccine
   efficiently reconstitutes in vivo to generate a neutralizing antibody
   response equivalent to that generated by subcutaneous injection. (C)

Abstract = {{The modification of cellulose acetate (CA) films via grafting of
   vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) to -OH groups, with subsequent condensation
   of hydrolyzed methoxy groups on the slime to form a polymer network is
   presented. The technique is referred to as GCV-modification. The
   modified material maintains similar H2S/CH4 and CO2/CH4 selectivities
   compared to the unmodified material; however the pure CO2 and H2S
   permeabilities are 139 and 165 barrers, respectively, which are more
   than an order of magnitude higher than the neat polymer. The membranes
   were tested at feed pressures of up to 700 psia in a ternary 20 vol.
   \%H2S/20 vol. \% CO2/60 vol. \% CH4 mixture. Even under aggressive feed
   conditions, GCV-modified CA showed comparable selectivities and
   significantly higher permeabilities. Furthermore, GCV-modified membrane
   had a lower T-g, lower crystallinity, and higher flexibility than neat
   CA. The higher flexibility is due to the vinyl substituent provided by
   VTMS, thereby reducing brittleness, which could be helpful in an
   asymmetric membrane structure.}},

Abstract = {{Na-ion batteries represent an effective energy storage technology with
   slightly lower energy and power densities but potentially lower material
   costs than Li-ion batteries. Here, we report a new polyanionic
   intercalation cathode material of an unusual chemical class: sidorenkite
   (Na3MnPO4CO3). This carbonophosphate compound shows a high discharge
   capacity (similar to 125 mAh/g) and specific energy (374 Wh/kg). In situ
   X-ray diffraction measurement suggests that sidorenkite undergoes a
   solid solution type reversible topotactic structural evolution upon
   electrochemical cycling. Ex situ solid state NMR investigation reveals
   that more than one Na per formula unit can be deintercalated from the
   structure, indicating a rarely observed two-electron intercalation
   reaction in which both Mn2+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couples are
   electrochemically active.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims at proposing an innovative phase control
   methodology for semiactive tuned mass dampers (SA-TMDs) that intend to
   minimize the off-tuned problems associated with passive tuned mass
   dampers (P-TMDs). The phase control algorithm is first developed, the
   essential of which is to apply the variable friction force to slow down
   the mass block at specific moments when the phase lag of the SA-TMD with
   respect to the structure is different from 900, resulting in the SA-TMD
   back to the desired phase lag, i.e., -90 degrees phase deviation, so
   that the SA-TMD has the maximum power flow to reduce the structural
   vibration. The feasibility of the application of the phase control in
   SA-TMDs is verified by performing numerical analyses of a simplified
   Taipei 101 structure model with a SA-TMD subjected to sinusoidal loads
   and design level wind loads. The numerical simulation results show that
   the SA-TMD implemented with phase control can enable the mass block to
   vibrate in a manner with a phase lag close to the -90 degrees when the
   structure model is under sinusoidal excitations with frequencies
   different from the structural fundamental mode. The SA-TMD with phase
   control not only exhibits better performance than the optimal P-TMD in
   terms of suppressing the structural vibration, but also enhances its
   robustness, particularly when the SA-TMD is off-tuned to the structure.

Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Analog memristors that exhibit an electronic conductivity change in
   response to ionic motion have been simulated using the finite element
   method. Several physical mechanisms are considered for the
   redistribution of dopants within the device and all result in minimal
   resistance changes. The mechanisms considered that result in minimal
   resistance changes are initial ion concentration, hole mobility
   dependence on acceptor concentration, and geometry. In contrast, ion
   extraction results in a significant change in the simulated analog
   memristor resistance (many orders of magnitude). It is determined that
   if ions can be repeatedly cycled without damage to the crystal
   structure, ion extraction is the optimal analog ionic memristor
   operation mechanism. Given this conclusion, battery technology materials
   known for their robustness in spite of repeated ion
   extraction/replacement should be considered for reliable analog
   memristor applications. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the subsite-3 of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase)
   from Paenibacillus macerans was engineered to improve maltodextrin
   specificity for 2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G) synthesis.
   Specifically, the site-saturation mutagenesis of tyrosine 89, asparagine
   94, aspartic acid 196, and aspartic acid 372 in subsite-3 was separately
   performed, and three mutants Y89F (tyrosine -> phenylalanine), N94P
   (asparagine -> proline), and D196Y (aspartic acid -> tyrosine) produced
   higher AA-2G titer than the wild-type and the other mutants. Previously,
   we found the mutant K47L (lysine -> leucine) also had a higher
   maltodextrin specificity. Therefore, the four mutants K47L, Y89F, N94P,
   and D196Y were further used to construct the double, triple, and
   quadruple mutations. Among the 11 combinational mutants, the quadruple
   mutant K47L/Y89F/N94P/D196Y produced the highest AA-2G titer of 2.23
   g/L, which was increased by 85.8\% compared to that produced by the
   wild-type CGTase. The reaction kinetics of all the mutants were modeled,
   and the pH and thermal stabilities of all the mutants were analyzed. The
   structure modeling indicated that the enhanced maltodextrin specificity
   may be related with the changes of hydrogen bonding interactions between
   the side chain of residue at the four positions (47, 89, 94, and 196)
   and the substrate sugars. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent emission with a long lifetime (>1 s) from organic materials
   can only be observed at a low temperature, because of the significant
   nonradiative deactivation pathway that occurs at room-temperature (RT).
   If organic materials with persistent RT emission in air could be
   developed, they could potentially be utilized for a variety of
   applications. Here, organic host-guest materials with efficient
   persistent RT phosphorescence (RTP) are developed by minimizing the
   nonradiative deactivation pathway of triplet excitons. The nonradiative
   deactivation pathway is dependent on both nonradiative deactivation of
   the guest and quenching by diffusional motion of the host. The rigidity
   and oxygen barrier properties of the steroidal compound used as the host
   suppressed the quenching, and the aromatic hydrocarbon used as the guest
   is highly deuterated to minimize nonradiative deactivation of the guest.
   Red-green-blue persistent RTP with a lifetime >1 s and a quantum yield
   >10\% in air is realized for a pure organic material.}},

Abstract = {{A light-harvesting macromolecular assembly (PT-Ru) consisting of a
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) scaffold and pendant Ru(II) polypyridyl
   complexes that exhibits rapid and efficient formation of a long-lived
   charge-separated state is described here. Photoinduced electron transfer
   from the polymer backbone to Ru(II) was investigated by femtosecond
   transient absorption spectroscopy. Photoexcitation at 388 nm results in
   the excitation of both the polymer backbone and Ru(II) complexes, with
   relative excitation probabilities of 60 and 40\%, respectively. The
   dominant pathway (similar to 85\%) for decay of the polymer excited
   state is direct electron transfer from the polymer scaffold to Ru(II),
   forming a positive polaron and a reduced complex {[}Ru-II(L)(2)(L-)](+),
   denoted Ru(I). The charge-separated state PT+center dot-Ru(I) is
   long-lived, persisting for 20-60 mu s, and is attributed to the high
   mobility of holes on the polymer backbone, which facilitates spatial
   separation of the electron and hole, delaying recombination. The
   remaining 15\% of the polymer excited states undergo an alternate
   deactivation mechanism, possibly energy transfer to Ru(II), forming
   Ru(II){*}.Ru(II){*} formed by either direct excitation or energy
   transfer undergoes back energy transfer to the scaffold, forming the
   low-lying polymer triplet state on the nanosecond time scale.}},

Abstract = {{Tyrosyl radicals play essential roles in biological proton-coupled
   electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
   catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides and is vital in DNA
   replication in all organisms. Class Ia RNRs consist of alpha 2 and beta
   2 homodimeric subunits. In class Ia RNR, such as the E. coli enzyme, an
   essential tyrosyl radical (Y122O(center dot))-diferric cofactor is
   located in beta 2. Although Y122O(center dot) is extremely stable in
   free beta 2, Y122O(center dot) is highly reactive in the quaternary
   substrate-alpha 2 beta 2 complex and serves as a radical initiator in
   catalytic PCET between beta 2 and alpha 2. In this report, we
   investigate the structural interactions that control the reactivity of
   Y122O(center dot) in a model system, isolated E. coli beta 2.
   Y122O(center dot) was reduced with hydroxyurea (HU), a radical scavenger
   that quenches the radical in a clinically relevant reaction. In the
   difference FT-IR spectrum, associated with this PCET reaction, amide I
   (CO) and amide II (CN/NH) bands were observed. Specific C-13-labeling of
   the tyrosine C-1 carbon assigned a component of these bands to the
   Y122-T123 amide bond. Comparison to density functional calculations on a
   model dipeptide, tyrosine-threonine, and structural modeling
   demonstrated that PCET is associated with a Y122 rotation and a 7.2
   angstrom translation of the Y122 phenolic oxygen. To test for the
   functional consequences of this structural change, a proton inventory
   defined the origin of the large solvent isotope effect (SIB = 16.7 +/-
   1.0 at 25 degrees C) on this reaction. These data suggest that the
   one-electron, HU-mediated reduction of Y122O(center dot) is associated
   with two, rate-limiting (full or partial) proton transfer reactions. One
   is attributable to HU oxidation (SIE = 11.9, net H atom transfer), and
   the other is attributable to coupled, hydrogen-bonding changes in the
   Y122O(center dot)-diferric cofactor (SIB = 1.4). These results
   illustrate the importance of redox-linked changes to backbone and ring
   dihedral angles in high potential PCET and provide evidence for
   rate-limiting, redox-linked hydrogen-bonding interactions between
   Y122O(center dot) and the iron cluster.}},

Abstract = {{The study and optimization of nanofabrication techniques in
   nanotechnology research is often challenging because experiments are
   costly to conduct in terms of time and money. In particular, for a new
   system that has not been previously studied at length, it is a challenge
   to efficiently plan the first round of experiments in the region of
   interest near the process optimum, and there may be multiple process
   inputs that must be optimized simultaneously. A purely statistical
   approach to this challenge would apply a space-filling experimental
   design, or, alternatively, domain knowledge could be applied to guide
   the experimental design. However, both of these approaches may waste
   precious resources by failing to sample efficiently near the desired
   process output. In this work, a novel technique termed ``initial
   experimental design{''} (IED) is applied to combine the statistical and
   experimental approaches for planning the initial round of experiments
   for a new system that is related to a similar but nonidentical existing
   system. The new system is directed toward the deposition of iridium
   nanoparticles on a silicon wafer surface from an iridium
   hexafluoroacetylacetonate cyclooctadiene (Ir(hfac)(COD)) precursor in
   supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2), while the older, related system
   studies the deposition of silver nanoparticles on Si from Ag(hfac)(COD)
   in sc-CO2. The goal was to deposit 40 nm mean size Ir nanoparticles
   within a tolerance of 5 nm. The previous data of mean particle size vs
   temperature from the Ag(hfac) (COD) system were used in concert with
   expert opinions about the behavior of the new system, elicited via
   survey instrument, to efficiently plan the experiments in the new
   Ir(hfac)(COD) system. Four experts were surveyed for their conjectures
   on the design space and Arrhenius model structure for the new system. A
   unified model incorporating the experts' conflicting opinions was then
   built to use in the experimental design, which balanced a space-filling
   design with an objective-oriented design. The IED approach succeeded in
   directing experiments toward the desired process optimum at a
   temperature of 175 degrees C, although the variance of the prediction of
   the local mean Arrhenius model did not fall within the 5 nm tolerance
   for the local model chosen to fit the data. Moreover, an altogether
   unforeseen growth mode was also observed for the Ir(hfac)(COD) system
   that had not been previously observed in the Ag(hfac)(COD) system.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the potential effectiveness of metropolitan land
   cover change as a climate change adaptation strategy for managing rising
   temperatures in a large and rapidly warming metropolitan region of the
   United States. Through the integration of a mesoscale meteorological
   model with estimated land cover data for the Atlanta, Georgia region in
   2010, this study quantifies the influence of extensive land cover change
   at the periphery of a large metropolitan region on temperature within
   the city center. The first study to directly model a metropolitan scale
   heat transfer mechanism, we find both enhanced tree canopy and
   impervious cover hi the suburban zones of the Atlanta region to produce
   statistically significant cooling and warming effects in the urban core.
   Based on these findings, we conclude that urban heat island management
   both within and beyond the central developed core of large cities may
   provide an effective climate change adaptation strategy for large
   metropolitan regions.}},

Abstract = {{We compare electric and diesel urban delivery trucks in terms of
   life-cycle energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and total
   cost of ownership (TCO). The relative benefits of electric trucks depend
   heavily on vehicle efficiency associated with drive cycle, diesel fuel
   price, travel demand, electric drive battery replacement and price,
   electricity generation and transmission efficiency, electric truck
   recharging infrastructure, and purchase price. For a drive cycle with
   frequent stops and low average speed such as the New York City Cycle
   (NYCC), electric trucks emit 42-61\% less GHGs and consume 32-54\% less
   energy than diesel trucks, depending upon vehicle efficiency cases. Over
   an array of possible conditions, the median TCO of electric trucks is
   22\% less than that of diesel trucks on the NYCC. For a drive cycle with
   less frequent stops and high average speed such as the City-Suburban
   Heavy Vehicle Cycle (CSHVC), electric trucks emit 19-43\% less GHGs and
   consume 5-34\% less energy, but cost 1\% more than diesel counterparts.
   Considering current and projected U.S. regional electricity generation
   mixes, for the baseline case, the energy use and GHG emissions ratios of
   electric to diesel trucks range from 48 to 82\% and 25 to 89\%,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombus formation over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque cap can
   occlude an artery with fatal consequences. We describe a computational
   model of platelet transport and binding to interpret rate-limiting steps
   seen in experimental thrombus formation over a collagen-coated stenosis.
   The model is used to compute shear rates in stenoses with growing
   boundaries. In the model, moving erythrocytes influence platelet
   transport based on shear-dependent enhanced diffusivity and a nonuniform
   platelet distribution. Adhesion is modeled as platelet-platelet binding
   kinetics. The results indicate that observed thrombus growth rates are
   limited by platelet transport to the wall for shear rates up to 6000
   s(-1). Above 7000 s(-1), the thrombus growth rate is likely limited by
   binding kinetics (10(-4) m/s). Thrombus growth computed from these
   rate-limiting steps match the thrombus location and occlusion times for
   experimental conditions if a lag time for platelet activation is
   included. Using fitted parameters, the model is then used to predict
   thrombus size and shape at a higher Reynolds number flow consistent with
   coronary artery disease.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma is a disease with poor survival rates after diagnosis.
   Treatment of the disease involves debulking of the tumor, which is
   limited by the degree of invasiveness of the disease. Therefore, a
   treatment to halt the invasion of glioma is desirable for clinical
   implementation. There have been several candidate compounds targeting
   specific aspects of invasion, including cell adhesions, matrix
   degradation, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, but they have failed
   clinically for a variety of reasons. New targets against glioma invasion
   include upstream mediators of these classical targets in an effort to
   better inhibit invasion with more specificity for cancer. Included in
   these treatments is a new class of compounds inhibiting the generation
   of reactive oxygen species by targeting the NADPH oxidases. These
   compounds stand to inhibit multiple pathways, including nuclear factor
   kappa B and Akt. By conducting a screen of compounds thought to inhibit
   these pathways, a new compound to halt invasion was found that may have
   a beneficial effect against glioma, based on recent publications.
   Further, there are still limitations to the treatment of glioblastoma
   regardless of the discovery of new targets and compounds that should be
   addressed to better the therapies against this deadly cancer.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the controlled subdiffraction modulations of photosensitive
   polymer films that are induced by surface plasmon interference in
   striking contrast to well-known conventional microscopic gratings. The
   near-field light intensity patterns were generated at the nanoslits
   fabricated in a silver layer with the photosensitive polymer film placed
   above. We observed that the topographical modulations can be excited
   only when the polarization is perpendicular to the nanoslits. Moreover,
   we have shown that light with certain wavelengths resulted in a
   characteristic topographical pattern with the periodicity three times
   smaller than the wavelength of incoming light. A combination of
   experimental observations with simulations showed that the unique
   subdiffraction topographical patterns are caused by constructive
   interference between two counter-propagating surface plasmon waves
   generated at neighboring nanoslits in the metal layer beneath the
   photosensitive polymer film. The light intensity distribution was
   simulated to demonstrate strong dependency upon the slit array
   periodicity as well as wavelength and polarization of incoming light.}},

Abstract = {{A microresonator-based interfacial fatigue testing technique was used to
   investigate the subcritical delamination of atomic layer deposited
   alumina coatings along the sidewalls of deep-reactiveion tched
   monocrystalline silicon thin films. This technique ensures loading
   conditions relevant to microelectromechanical system devices, including
   kHz testing frequency and fully reversed cyclic stresses. Four different
   coating thicknesses (4.2, 12.6, 25, and 50 nm) were investigated in two
   environments (30 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity (RH) and 80 degrees
   C, 90\% RH). Fatigue damage, in the form of channel cracks and
   delamination of the alumina coating, was found to accumulate slowly over
   more than 1 x 10(8) cycles. The average delamination rates increase with
   increasing energy release rate amplitude for delamination, modeled with
   a power law relationship. In the harsher environment, the rates are
   roughly 1 order of magnitude higher. Additionally, a few tests under
   static load were conducted for which no delamination (or crack growth)
   occurred, demonstrating that the governing interfacial fatigue mechanism
   is cycle-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{We report a citrate-free synthesis of Ag nanoplates with an edge length
   of 50 nm that involved the reduction of AgNO3 by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
   (PVP) in ethanol at 80 degrees C under a solvothermal condition. Within
   a period of 4 h, greater than 99\% of the initially added AgNO3 could be
   converted into Ag nanoplates with excellent stability. To understand
   this remarkably simple and efficient process, we systematically
   investigated the roles played by various reaction parameters, which
   include the type of precursor, reducing powers of PVP and ethanol, molar
   ratio of PVP to AgNO3, solvent, involvement of O-2, and effects of
   pressure and temperature. Our results suggest a plausible mechanism that
   involves (i) fast reduction of AgNO3 to generate Ag multiple twinned
   particles (MTPs) via a thermodynamically controlled process, (ii)
   kinetically controlled formation of plate-like seeds and their further
   growth into small nanoplates in the presence of Ag+ ions at a low
   concentration, and (iii) complete transfer of Ag atoms from the MPTs to
   nanoplates via O-2-mediated Ostwald ripening. We demonstrated that the
   molar ratio of PVP to AgNO3 in ethanol plays an essential role in
   controlling the reduction rate for the formation of MTPs and plate-like
   seeds under the solvothermal condition, transformation kinetics, and
   final morphology taken by the Ag nanoplates. In particular, when the
   reaction temperatures were above the boiling point of ethanol, the
   pressure induced by a solvothermal process accelerated the oxidative
   etching of Ag MTPs to facilitate their complete conversion into
   nanoplates. The mechanistic insight could serve as a guideline to
   optimize the experimental parameters of a solvothermal synthesis to
   control the reduction kinetics and thus the formation of metallic
   nanocrystals with controlled shapes and in high yields and large
   quantities.}},

Abstract = {{This Article describes a facile approach to the synthesis of rutile
   nanostructures in the form of porous fibers or bundles of nanotubes by
   maneuvering the surface wettability of yarns made of polystyrene
   nanofibrils. Specifically, hierarchically porous fibers were obtained by
   hydrolyzing titanium tetraisopropoxide to form TiO2 nanoparticles in the
   void spaces among hydrophobic nanofibrils in each yarn. After
   calcination in air at 800 degrees C, the resultant fibers were comprised
   of many interconnected rutile nanoparticles whose diameters were in the
   range 20-80 nm. After converting the nanofibrils and yarns into
   hydrophilic surfaces through plasma treatment, however, the TiO2 formed
   conformal coatings on the surfaces of nanofibrils in each yarn during
   hydrolysis instead of just filling the void spaces among the
   nanofibrils. As a result, bundles of rutile nanotubes were obtained
   after the sample had been calcined in air at 800 degrees C. The
   thermodynamically stable rutile nanostructures were then explored as
   supports for Pt nanoparticles whose catalytic activity was evaluated
   using the reduction of p-nitrophenol by NaBH4. The Pt supported on
   porous rutile fibers exhibited a better performance than the Pt on
   rutile nanotubes in terms of both induction time (t(ind)) and apparent
   rate constant (k(app)).}},

Abstract = {{The residual stress (RS) and refractive index (RI) distributions of
   large-mode-area (LMA) erbium-doped fibers (EDFs) are measured for the
   first time using a high-resolution three-dimensional index-stress
   distribution measurement method. The effects of fiber manufacturing,
   cleaving, and arc fusion splicing of a commercially available LMA EDF
   are concurrently characterized at state-of-the-art stress, index, and
   spatial resolutions. RS induced via fiber manufacturing results in RI
   changes as large as 1.2 x 10(-4) RI units through the photo-elastic
   effect. The relaxation of RS within similar to 30 mu m of a cleaved
   end-face reverses the stress-induced RI changes formed during fiber
   manufacturing. After fusion splicing, an even larger stress-induced RI
   change of 3.5 x 10(-4) RI units results over an axial distance on the
   order of millimeters. The diffusion of core dopants reduces the maximum
   core RI by as much as 21.7\% along a transition region length of similar
   to 400 mu m. These measurements represent the first of many required to
   develop future ultra LMA EDFs where RS effects and dopant diffusion are
   absolutely critical for fiber design and performance.}},

Abstract = {{Piperlongumine (PL), isolated from the fruit of Long pepper, Piper
   longum, is a cancer-inhibiting compound that selectively kills tumor
   cells while sparing their normal counterparts. Here we evaluated the
   efficacy with which PL suppresses malignant B cells derived from a newly
   developed, double-transgenic mouse model of human endemic Burkitt
   lymphoma (BL), designated mCD40-LMP1/iMyc(E mu). PL inhibited tumor cell
   proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner and induced apoptosis
   of neoplastic but not normal B cells. Treatment with PL resulted in
   downregulation of EBV-encoded LMP1, cellular Myc, constitutive NF-kappa
   B activity, and a host of LMP1-Myc-NF-kappa B-regulated target genes
   including Aurka, Bcat1, Bub1b, Ccnb1, Chek1, Fancd2, Tfrc and Xrcc6. Of
   note, p21(Cip1)-encoding Cdkn1a was suppressed independent of changes in
   Trp53 mRNA levels and p53 DNA-binding activity. Considering the central
   role of the LMP1-NF-kappa B-Myc axis in B-lineage neoplasia, these
   findings further our understanding of the mechanisms by which PL
   inhibits B-lymphoma and provide a preclinical rationale for the
   inclusion of PL in new interventions in blood cancers. (c) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The biological formation of inorganic materials (biomineralization)
   often occurs in specialized intracellular vesicles. Prominent examples
   are diatoms, a group of single-celled eukaryotic microalgae that produce
   their SiO2 (silica)-based cell walls within intracellular silica
   deposition vesicles (SDVs). SDVs contain protein-based organic matrices
   that control silica formation, resulting in species specifically
   nanopatterned biosilica, an organic-inorganic composite material. So far
   no information is available regarding the molecular mechanisms of SDV
   biogenesis. Here we have investigated by fluorescence microscopy and
   subcellular membrane fractionation the intracellular transport of
   silaffin Sil3. Silaffins are a group of phosphoproteins constituting the
   main components of the organic matrix of diatom biosilica. We
   demonstrate that the N-terminal signal peptide of Sil3 mediates import
   into a specific subregion of the endoplasmic reticulum. Additional
   segments from the mature part of Sil3 are required to reach
   post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments. Further transport of Sil3 and
   incorporation into the biosilica (silica targeting) require protein
   segments that contain a high density of modified lysine residues and
   phosphoserines. Silica targeting of Sil3 is not dependent on a
   particular peptide sequence, yet a lysine-rich 12-14-amino acid peptide
   motif (pentalysine cluster), which is conserved in all silaffins,
   strongly promotes silica targeting. The results of the present work
   provide the first insight into the molecular mechanisms for biogenesis
   of mineral-forming vesicles from an eukaryotic organism.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the recombination kinetics and the density of states
   distribution in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells was
   undertaken using impedance spectroscopy measurements under varying
   levels of illuminations. Three organic polymer solar cells were
   investigated which differed only by the p-type polymer used in the
   active layers while the device architecture and acceptor molecule
   (PC70BM) were kept the same. We found that the density of states
   profiles for the three cells are similar and can be superimposed by a
   horizontal shift due to a difference between the polymers' HOMO and the
   PC70BM's LUMO levels. The recombination mechanisms for the three cells
   showed the same behavior, suggesting an important role of the acceptor
   in this process however, large differences in the absolute value of
   carrier lifetime tau(eff) related to the choice of the polymer are
   evident, indicating that the recombination kinetics depends on a
   combination of the properties of both materials and the morphology of
   their blend.}},

Abstract = {{Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million
   years(1). These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of
   total carbon fixation in some systems(2). They form blooms that can
   occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished
   by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths),
   rendering them visible from space(3). Although coccolithophores export
   carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they
   also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a
   complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or
   uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean(4). Here we report
   the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore
   Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional
   isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes
   distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical
   complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across
   strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a
   single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in
   different metabolic repertoires. Genome variability within this species
   complex seems to underpin its capacity both to thrive in habitats
   ranging from the equator to the subarctic and to form large-scale
   episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing physician performance is important for the purposes of
   measuring and improving quality of service and reducing healthcare
   delivery costs. In recent years, physician performance scorecards have
   been used to provide feedback on individual measures; however, one key
   challenge is how to develop a composite quality index that combines
   multiple measures for overall physician performance evaluation. A
   controversy arises over establishing appropriate weights to combine
   indicators in multiple dimensions, and cannot be easily resolved. In
   this study, we proposed a generic unsupervised learning approach to
   develop a single composite index for physician performance assessment by
   using non-negative principal component analysis. We developed a new
   algorithm named iterative quadratic programming to solve the numerical
   issue in the non-negative principal component analysis approach. We
   conducted real case studies to demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed method. We provided interpretations from both statistical and
   clinical perspectives to evaluate the developed composite ranking score

Abstract = {{Production of chemical concentration gradients on the submicrometer
   scale remains a formidable challenge, despite the broad range of
   potential applications and their ubiquity throughout nature. We present
   a strategy to quantitatively prescribe spatial variations in functional
   group concentration using ThermoChemical NanoLithography (TCNL). The
   approach uses a heated cantilever to drive a localized nanoscale
   chemical reaction at an interface, where a reactant is transformed into
   a product. We show using friction, force microscopy that localized
   gradients in the product concentration have a spatial resolution of
   similar to 20 nm where the entire concentration profile is confined to
   sub-180 nm. To gain quantitative control over the concentration, we
   introduce a chemical kinetics model of the thermally driven nanoreaction
   that shows excellent agreement with experiments. The comparison provides
   a calibration of the nonlinear dependence of product concentration
   versus temperature, which we use to design two-dimensional temperature
   maps encoding the prescription for linear and nonlinear gradients. The
   resultant chemical nanopatterns show high fidelity to the user-defined
   patterns, including the ability to realize complex chemical patterns
   with arbitrary variations in peak concentration with a spatial
   resolution of 180 nm or better. While this work focuses on producing
   chemical gradients of amine groups, other functionalities are a
   straightforward modification. We envision that using the basic scheme
   introduced here, quantitative TCNL will be capable of patterning
   gradients of other exploitable physical or chemical properties such as
   fluorescence in conjugated polymers and conductivity in graphene. The
   access to submicrometer chemical concentration and gradient patterning
   provides a new dimension of control for nanolithography.}},

Abstract = {{Tensile properties of gel-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PAN/carbon
   nanotube (CNT) fibers were studied as a function of temperature from
   -100 degrees C to 300 degrees C at a constant strain rate of 0.01/s.
   Tensile strength and modulus values at low temperature were as high as
   1.65 GPa and 44.4 GPa, respectively. The tensile strength and modulus of
   PAN fibers decreased with increasing temperature, while drawability
   dramatically increased in a narrow temperature window near ala,
   transition temperature. Three transitions, namely, gamma, beta(c), and
   alpha/alpha(c) transitions were observed by dynamic mechanical analysis.
   The relationships between tensile properties and thermal transitions,
   the effect of the addition of CNT, and the structure evolution during
   the elongation at temperatures above the PAN alpha/alpha(c) transition
   were investigated. Understanding of the drawing behavior of PAN and
   PAN/CNT is important so the highest property carbon fibers can be
   processed from these fibers. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{84}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{In rectilinear locomotion, snakes propel themselves using unidirectional
   travelling waves of muscular contraction, in a style similar to
   earthworms. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we film
   rectilinear locomotion of three species of snakes, including red-tailed
   boa constrictors, Dumeril's boas and Gaboon vipers. The kinematics of a
   snake's extension-contraction travelling wave are characterized by wave
   frequency, amplitude and speed. We find wave frequency increases with
   increasing body size, an opposite trend than that for legged animals. We
   predict body speed with 73-97\% accuracy using a mathematical model of a
   one-dimensional n-linked crawler that uses friction as the dominant
   propulsive force. We apply our model to show snakes have optimal wave
   frequencies: higher values increase Froude number causing the snake to
   slip; smaller values decrease thrust and so body speed. Other choices of
   kinematic variables, such as wave amplitude, are suboptimal and appear
   to be limited by anatomical constraints. Our model also shows that local
   body lifting increases a snake's speed by 31 per cent, demonstrating
   that rectilinear locomotion benefits from vertical motion similar to
   walking.}},

   Cancer Outcome Prediction-An Empirical Assessment}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{The promise of microarray technology in providing prediction classifiers
   for cancer outcome estimation has been confirmed by a number of
   demonstrable successes. However, the reliability of prediction results
   relies heavily on the accuracy of statistical parameters involved in
   classifiers. It cannot be reliably estimated with only a small number of
   training samples. Therefore, it is of vital importance to determine the
   minimum number of training samples and to ensure the clinical value of
   microarrays in cancer outcome prediction. We evaluated the impact of
   training sample size on model performance extensively based on 3
   large-scale cancer microarray datasets provided by the second phase of
   MicroArray Quality Control project (MAQC-II). An SSNR-based (scale of
   signal-to-noise ratio) protocol was proposed in this study for minimum
   training sample size determination. External validation results based on
   another 3 cancer datasets confirmed that the SSNR-based approach could
   not only determine the minimum number of training samples efficiently,
   but also provide a valuable strategy for estimating the underlying
   performance of classifiers in advance. Once translated into clinical
   routine applications, the SSNR-based protocol would provide great
   convenience in microarray-based cancer outcome prediction in improving
   classifier reliability.}},

   Flexibility on Molecular Diffusion in Zeolites: CH4 Diffusion in Eight

Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) and transition state theory (TST) methods are
   becoming efficient tools for predicting diffusion of molecules in
   nanoporous materials. The accuracy of predictions, however, often
   depends upon a major assumption that the framework of the material is
   rigid. This saves a considerable amount of computational time and is
   often the only method applicable to materials for which accurate force
   fields to model framework flexibility are not available. In this study,
   we systematically characterize the effect of framework flexibility on
   diffusion in four model zeolites (LTA, CHA, ERI, and BIK) that exhibit
   different patterns of window flexibility. We show that for molecules
   with kinetic diameters comparable to (or larger than) the size of the
   window the rigid framework approximation can produce order(s) of
   magnitude difference in diffusivities as compared to the simulations
   performed with a fully flexible framework. We also show that simple
   recipes to include the effect of framework flexibility are not generally
   accurate. To account for framework flexibility effects efficiently and
   reliably, we introduce two new methods in which the flexible structure
   is approximated as a set of discrete rigid snapshots obtained from
   simulations of dynamics of an empty framework, using either classical
   or, in principle, ab initio methods. In the first method, we perform MD
   simulations of diffusion in a usual manner but replace the rigid
   structure with a new random snapshot at a certain characteristic
   frequency corresponding to the breathing motion of the window, while
   keeping positions of adsorbate molecules constant. In the second method,
   we directly compute cage to cage hopping rates in each rigid snapshot
   using TST and average over a distribution of snapshots. Excellent
   agreement is obtained between diffusivities predicted with these two new
   methods and direct MD simulations using fully flexible structures. Both
   methods are orders of magnitude more efficient than the simulations with
   the fully flexible structure. The new methods are broadly applicable for
   fast and accurate predictions of both infinite dilution and finite
   loading diffusivities of simple molecules in zeolites and other
   nanoporous materials, generally without the need for an accurate
   flexible force field.}},

Title = {{Metabolic and Transcriptional Analysis of Acid Stress in Lactococcus
   lactis, with a Focus on the Kinetics of Lactic Acid Pools}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The effect of pH on the glucose metabolism of non-growing cells of L.
   lactis MG1363 was studied by in vivo NMR in the range 4.8 to 6.5.
   Immediate pH effects on glucose transporters and/or enzyme activities
   were distinguished from transcriptional/translational effects by using
   cells grown at the optimal pH of 6.5 or pre-adjusted to low pH by growth
   at 5.1. In cells grown at pH 5.1, glucose metabolism proceeds at a rate
   35\% higher than in non-adjusted cells at the same pH. Besides the
   upregulation of stress-related genes (such as dnaK and groEL), cells
   adjusted to low pH overexpressed H+-ATPase subunits as well as
   glycolytic genes. At sub-optimal pHs, the total intracellular pool of
   lactic acid reached approximately 500 mM in cells grown at optimal pH
   and about 700 mM in cells grown at pH 5.1. These high levels, together
   with good pH homeostasis (internal pH always above 6), imply
   intracellular accumulation of the ionized form of lactic acid (lactate
   anion), and the concomitant export of the equivalent protons. The
   average number, n, of protons exported with each lactate anion was
   determined directly from the kinetics of accumulation of intra-and
   extracellular lactic acid as monitored online by C-13-NMR. In cells
   non-adjusted to low pH, n varies between 2 and 1 during glucose
   consumption, suggesting an inhibitory effect of intracellular lactate on
   proton export. We confirmed that extracellular lactate did not affect
   the lactate: proton stoichiometry. In adjusted cells, n was lower and
   varied less, indicating a different mix of lactic acid exporters less
   affected by the high level of intracellular lactate. A qualitative model
   for pH effects and acid stress adaptation is proposed on the basis of
   these results.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing carbon dioxide emissions are generally believed to contribute
   to global warming. Developing new materials for capturing CO2 emitted
   from coal-fired plants can potentially mitigate the effect of these CO2
   emissions. In this study, we developed and optimized porous hollow fiber
   sorbents with both improved sorption capacities and rapid sorption
   kinetics by functionalizing aminosilane
   (N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminoisobutyldimethylmethoxysilane) to cellulose
   acetate hollow fibers as a ``proof of concept{''}. A lumen-side barrier
   layer was also developed in the aminosilane-functionalized cellulose
   acetate fiber sorbent to allow for facile heat exchange without
   significant mass transfer with the bore-side heat transfer fluid. The
   functionalized cellulose acetate fiber sorbents were characterized by
   pressure decay sorption measurements, multicomponent column
   chromatography, FT-IR, elemental analysis, and scanning electron
   microscopy. The carbon dioxide sorption capacity at 1 atm is 0.73 mmol/g
   by using the pressure decay apparatus. Multicomponent column
   chromatography measurements showed that aminosilane functionalized
   cellulose acetate fiber sorbent has a CO2 sorption capacity of 0.23
   mmol/g at CO2 partial pressure 0.1 atm and 35 degrees C in simulated
   flue gas. While this capacity is low, our proof of concept positions the
   technology to move forward to higher capacity with work that is
   underway. The presence of silicon and nitrogen elements in the elemental
   analysis confirmed the success of grafting along with FT-IR spectra
   which showed the absorbance peak (similar to 810 cm(-1)) for Si-C
   stretching. A crosslinked Neoprene material was used to form the
   lumen-side barrier layer. Preliminary data showed the required reduction
   in gas permeance to eliminate mixing between shell side and bore side
   fluid flows. Specifically the permeance was reduced from 10 000 GPUs for
   the neat fibers to 6.6 +/- 0.1 and 3.3 +/- 0.3 GPUs for the coated
   fibers. The selected lumen layer formation materials demonstrated strong
   resistance to water and oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes measurements of the response of bluff-body
   stabilized flames subjected to transverse acoustic waves. It is the
   first of a two-article series. The objective of this work was to extend
   prior studies of this nature to much higher Reynolds numbers and more
   severe environments that more closely mimic conditions encountered in
   applications. To this end, experiments were performed at flow velocities
   of 50m/s and 100m/s with inlet air temperatures ranging from 475-750K.
   Two different modes of acoustic excitation were applied, corresponding
   to velocity and pressure nodes/antinodes along the combustor centerline.
   High-speed imaging and phase-locked particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   were used to characterize the spatio-temporal flame front and velocity
   field response. The data show that the disturbance field and the flame
   front response amplitude exhibit a nonmonotonic spatial distribution
   with interference patterns. The phase of the flame front response at the
   forcing frequency varies nearly linearly with downstream distance, and
   corresponds to a phase speed that is slightly less than the mean flow
   velocity. Significantly, these results show that the key features of the
   flame's magnitude and phase characteristics are quite similar to those
   observed in much lower flow velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Ionophore antibiotics (IPAs) are polyether antimicrobials widely used in
   the livestock industry and may enter the environment via land
   application of animal waste and agricultural runoff. Information is
   scarce regarding potential transformation of IPAs under environmental
   conditions. This study is among the first to identify the propensity of
   IPAs to undergo acid-catalyzed transformation in mildly acidic aquatic
   systems and characterize the reactions in depth. The study focused on
   the most widely used monensin (MON) and salinomycin (SAL), and also
   included narasin (NAR) in the investigation. All three IPAs are
   susceptible to acid-catalyzed transformation. MON reacts much more
   slowly than SAL and NAR and exhibits a different kinetic behavior that
   is further evaluated by a reversible reaction kinetic model. Extensive
   product characterization identifies that the spiro-ketal group of IPAs
   is the reactive site for the acid-catalyzed hydrolytic transformation,
   yielding predominantly isomeric and other products. Toxicity evaluation
   of the transformation products shows that the products retain some
   antimicrobial properties. The occurrence of IPAs and isomeric
   transformation products is also observed in poultry litter and
   agricultural runoff samples. Considering the common presence of mildly
   acidic environments (pH 4-7) in soils and waters, the acid-catalyzed
   transformation identified in this study likely plays an important role
   in the environmental fate of IPAs.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the microbial activity in nature takes place at interfaces,
   which are often associated with redox discontinuities. One example is
   the oxic/anoxic interface where polluted groundwater interacts with the
   overlying vadose zone. We tested whether microbes in the vadose zone can
   use synthetic chemicals as electron donors and thus protect the
   overlying air and buildings from groundwater pollutants. Samples from
   the vadose zone of a site contaminated with chlorobenzene (CB),
   1,2-dichlorobenzene (12DCB), and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (14DCB) were packed
   in a multiport column to simulate the interface of the vadose zone with
   an underlying groundwater plume. A mixture of CB, 12DCB, and 14DCB in
   anoxic water was pumped continuously through the bottom of column to an
   outlet below the first sampling port to create an oxic/anoxic interface
   and a capillary fringe. Removal to below the detection limits by rapid
   biodegradation with rates of 21 +/- 1 mg of CB . m(-2) . d(-1), 3.7 +/-
   0.5 mg of 12DCB . m(-2) . d(-1), and 7.4 +/- 0.7 mg of 1.4 DCB . m(-2) .
   d(-1) indicated that natural attenuation in the capillary fringe can
   prevent the migration of CB, 12DCB, and 14DCB vapors. Enumeration of
   bacteria capable of degrading chlorobenzenes suggested that most of the
   biodegradation takes place within the first 10 cm above the saturated
   zone. Biodegradation also increased the upward flux of contaminants and
   thus enhanced their elimination from the underlying water. The results
   revealed a substantial biodegradation capacity for chlorinated aromatic
   compounds at the oxic/anoxic interface and illustrate the role of
   microbes in creating steep redox gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the fate of nitroaromatic explosives in the subsurface is
   challenging because contaminants are present in different phases (e.g.,
   bound to soil or sediment matrix or as solid-phase residues) and
   transformation takes place via several potentially competing pathways
   over time-scales of decades. We developed a procedure for
   compound-specific analysis of stable C, N, and H isotopes in
   nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) and characterized biodegradation of
   2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and two dinitrotoluene isomers (2,4-DNT and
   2,6-DNT) in subsurface material of a contaminated site. The type and
   relative contribution of reductive and oxidative pathways to the
   degradation of the three contaminants was inferred from the combined
   evaluation of C, N, and H isotope fractionation. Indicative trends of
   Delta delta N-15 vs Delta delta C-13 and Delta delta H-2 vs Delta delta
   C-13 were obtained from laboratory model systems for biodegradation
   pathways initiated via (i) dioxygenation, (ii) reduction, and (iii)
   CH3-group oxidation. The combined evaluation of NAC isotope
   fractionation in subsurface materials and in laboratory experiments
   suggests that in the field, 86-89\% of 2,4-DNT transformation was due to
   dioxygenation while TNT was mostly reduced and 2,6-DNT reacted via a
   combination of reduction and CH3-group oxidation. Based on historic
   information on site operation, our data imply biodegradation of 2,4-DNT
   with half-lives of up to 9-17 years compared to 18-34 years for
   cometabolic transformation of TNT and 2,6-DNT.}},

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are polypentapeptides that undergo
   hydrophobic collapse and aggregation above a specific transition
   temperature, T-t. ELP diblocks sharing a common core block (I60) but
   varying outer blocks (A80, P40) were designed, where T-t,T-I < T-t,T-A <
   T-t,T-P. The formation of approximate to 55 nm diameter mixed micelles
   from these ELP diblocks was verified using dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), multiangle light scattering (MALS) and fluorescence resonance
   energy transfer (FRET). To confer affinity to the blood circulating
   protein fibrinogen, a fibrinogen-binding tetrapeptide sequence (GPRP)
   was fused to A80-I60, while P40-I60 was fused to a non-binding control
   (GPSP). The self-assembling, peptide-displaying, mixed micelles exhibit
   temperature-modulated avidities for immobilized and soluble fibrinogen
   at 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C. In this initial proof-of-concept
   design, the engineered mixed micelles were shown to disengage fibrinogen
   at elevated temperatures. The modular nature of this system can be used
   for developing in vivo depot systems that will only be triggered to
   release in situ upon specific stimuli.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{944-956}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to controlling agent positions in
   single-leader networks to target points while explicitly taking agent
   homogeneity into account. When the capabilities of agents to accomplish
   tasks at each of the targets are identical, then the label of the target
   points may be permuted while still expressing the same intention. In
   single-leader networks which are not completely controllable, such a
   permutation of the target points may at times move a target closer to
   the system's reachable subspace, thereby allowing the network to surpass
   the limitations on controllability when homogeneity is not considered
   explicitly. To fully exploit this property in homogeneous networks, it
   is then necessary to find the permutation of a target point which brings
   it closest to the reachable subspace. However, finding this optimal
   permutation is shown to be in general a non-deterministic
   polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem. Specific network topologies are
   identified for when finding such an optimal permutation of a target
   point can be advantageous when controlling single-leader networks.
   Moreover, an alternate view of the problem of finding optimal
   permutations is presented in which clustering-based algorithms can be
   applied to find suboptimal solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells based on low bandgap
   polymer:fullerene blends are promising for next generation low-cost
   photovoltaics. While these solution-processed solar cells are compatible
   with large-scale roll-to-roll processing, active layers used for typical
   laboratory-scale devices are too thin to ensure high manufacturing
   yields. Furthermore, due to the limited light absorption and optical
   interference within the thin active layer, the external quantum
   efficiencies (EQEs) of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells are
   severely limited. In order to produce polymer solar cells with high
   yields, efficient solar cells with a thick active layer must be
   demonstrated. In this work, the performance of thick-film solar cells
   employing the low-bandgap polymer
   poly(dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione) (PDTG-TPD) was demonstrated.
   Power conversion efficiencies over 8.0\% were obtained for devices with
   an active layer thickness of 200 nm, illustrating the potential of this
   polymer for large-scale manufacturing. Although an average EQE > 65\%
   was obtained for devices with active layer thicknesses > 200 nm, the
   cell performance could not be maintained due to a reduction in fill
   factor. By comparing our results for PDTG-TPD solar cells with similar
   P3HT-based devices, we investigated the loss mechanisms associated with
   the limited device performance observed for thick-film low-bandgap
   polymer solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Context.-Participation in proficiency testing (PT) or external quality
   assessment (EQA) programs allows the assessment and comparison of test
   performance among different clinical laboratories and technologies. In
   addition to the approximately 2300 tests for individual genetic
   disorders, recent advances in technology have enabled the development of
   clinical tests that quickly and economically analyze the entire human
   genome. New PT/EQA approaches are needed to ensure the continued quality
   of these complex tests.
   Objectives.-To review the availability and scope of PT/EQA for molecular
   genetic testing for inherited conditions in Europe, Australasia, and the
   United States; to evaluate the successes and demonstrated value of
   available PT/EQA programs; and to examine the challenges to the
   provision of comprehensive PT/EQA posed by new laboratory practices and
   methodologies.
   Data Sources.-The available literature on this topic was reviewed and
   supplemented with personal experiences of several PT/EQA providers.
   Conclusions.-Proficiency testing/EQA schemes are available for common
   genetic disorders tested in many clinical laboratories but are not
   available for most genetic tests offered by only one or a few
   laboratories. Provision of broad, method-based PT schemes, such as DNA
   sequencing, would allow assessment of many tests for which formal PT is
   not currently available. Participation in PT/EQA improves the quality of
   testing by identifying inaccuracies that laboratories can trace to
   errors in their testing processes. Areas of research and development to
   ensure that PT/EQA programs can meet the needs of new and evolving
   genetic tests and technologies are identified and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid lattice-Boltzmann spectrin-link (LB-SL) method is used to
   simulate dense suspensions of red blood cells (RBCs) for investigating
   rheological properties of blood. RBC membranes are modelled using a
   coarse-grained SL method and are filled with a viscous Newtonian fluid
   solution with viscosity five times that of the suspending fluid.
   Relative viscosities, normal stress differences, and particle pressures
   are reported for a range of capillary numbers at a physiologically
   realistic haematocrit value of approximately 42.5 \%. Viscosity shear
   thinning is demonstrated for shear rates ranging from 14 to 440 s(-1)
   and is shown to be affected by the orientation and bending modulus of
   RBCs. The particle-phase pressure undergoes a change in sign from
   positive to negative as the shear rate is increased. The particle-phase
   normal stress tensor values show that there is a transition from
   compressive to tensile states in the flow direction as the shear rate is
   increased. The normal stress differences are notably different from
   those recently reported for deformable capsule suspensions using a
   similar methodology, which suggests that the bending stiffness and the
   biconcave shape of RBCs affect the rheology of blood.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge of membrane ultrafiltration technology for large-scale
   microalgal harvesting and recycling of used culture media is membrane
   fouling, and the chemical nature and molecular properties of fouling are
   not well understood. To determine possible membrane fouling mechanism, a
   bench-scale hollow fiber polyvinylchloride (PVC) ultrafiltration
   membrane unit was employed to harvest the unicellular green alga
   Chlorella zofingiensis grown in a flat plate photobioreactor. It
   revealed that Chlorella, bacteria, and dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   each clogged the membrane, and yet the most severe membrane fouling was
   caused by DOM, which was also found to be most difficult to remove from
   the membrane by periodical backwashing. DOM was further fractionated by
   high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) into three
   fractions, i.e., hydrophilic acid fraction (HPI-A), hydrophilic non-acid
   fraction (HPI-NA) and hydrophobic acid fraction (HPO-A), of which
   HPI-NA, particularly in a molecular weight range of 7-11 kDa, was the
   major foulants. The results also showed that a carbohydrate fraction of
   DOM caused greater membrane fouling than a protein fraction did. (C)

Abstract = {{A Swerling III/IV target is generally thought of as the sum of a
   dominant nonfluctuating reflector plus many smaller scatterers, and the
   many smaller scatterers are often thought of as having a combined
   voltage amplitude that is Rayleigh distributed (i.e., Swerling I/II). On
   the other hand, a Rician target is the result of a complex sum at
   baseband of a nonfluctuating object and a Rayleigh object. The Rician
   model is not easily reconciled with the standard four degree of freedom
   chi(2) distribution for the (power) amplitude of a Swerling III/IV
   target, and, indeed, we show here that no Swerling III/IV target is
   Rician. However, when the nonfluctuating or ``dominant{''} part of the
   Rician target is approximately 75\% of the total reflection, their
   dissimilarity is minimized (and is small). This phenomenon holds true
   when Gaussian receiver noise is involved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent increases in fuel prices and increased focus on aviation's
   environmental impacts have reignited focus on the open rotor engine
   concept. This type of architecture was extensively investigated in
   previous decades but was not pursued through to commercialization due to
   relatively high noise levels and a sudden, sharp decrease in fuel
   prices. More recent increases in fuel prices and increased government
   pressure from taxing carbon-dioxide production mean the open rotor is
   once again being investigated as a viable concept. Advances in
   aero-acoustic design tools have allowed industry and academia to
   re-investigate the open rotor with an increased emphasis on noise
   reduction while retaining the fuel burn benefits due to the increased
   propulsive efficiency. Recent research with conceptual level
   multidisciplinary considerations of the open rotor has been performed
   (Bellocq et al., 2010, ``Advanced Open Rotor Performance Modeling For
   Multidisciplinary Optimization Assessments,{''} Paper No. GT2010-2963),
   but there remains a need for a holistic approach that includes the
   coupled effects of the engine and airframe on fuel burn, emissions, and
   noise. Years of research at Georgia Institute of Technology have led to
   the development of the Environmental Design Space (EDS) (Kirby and
   Mavris, 2008, ``The Environmental Design Space,{''} Proceedings of the
   26th International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences). EDS serves to
   capture interdependencies at the conceptual design level of fuel burn,
   emissions, and noise for conventional and advanced engine and airframe
   architectures. Recently, leveraging NASA environmentally responsible
   aviation (ERA) modeling efforts, EDS has been updated to include an open
   rotor model to capture, in an integrated fashion, the effects of an open
   rotor on conventional airframe designs. Due to the object oriented
   nature of EDS, the focus has been on designing modular elements that can
   be updated as research progresses. A power management scheme has also
   been developed with the future capability to trade between fuel
   efficiency and noise using the variable pitch propeller system. Since
   the original GE open rotor test was performed using a military core,
   there is interest in seeing the effect of modern core-engine technology
   on the integrated open rotor performance. This research applies the
   modular EDS open rotor model in an engine cycle study to investigate the
   sensitivity of thermal efficiency improvements on open rotor
   performance, including the effects on weight and vehicle performance.
   The results are that advances in the core cycle are necessary to enable
   future bypass ratio growth and the trades between core operating
   temperatures and size become more significant as bypass ratio continues
   to increase. A general benefit of a 30\% reduction in block fuel is seen
   on a 737-800 sized aircraft.}},

Abstract = {{For sustainable engineering to contribute to sustainability, curricular

   Examining student perceptions of sustainability education can provide
   insights for benchmarking the current quality of a curriculum and for

   this study was to examine student interest in, knowledge of, and
   experiences related to sustainability in civil and environmental
   engineering (CEE) at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).
   A survey was developed and administered to students (n=153) enrolled in
   CEE capstone courses. The results indicated that although students are
   interested in sustainable development, there is potential for further
   enhancing sustainability learning. In addition, students reported that
   CEE courses strongly impacted their learning, which underscores the
   importance of curricular quality. Finally, although students were
   generally satisfied with CEE sustainability education, they cited the
   need for more guidance on integrating sustainability into the design
   process. Although this case study provides feedback to improve CEE
   sustainability education at Georgia Tech, it also serves as an example

Abstract = {{The Gulf Stream system features some of the fastest and most persistent
   currents in the Atlantic Ocean and has long been identified as a
   promising target for renewable ocean current energy. This study
   investigates the theoretical energy potential of ocean currents for the
   Gulf Stream system. A simplified analytical model is calibrated and
   utilized to represent the quasi-geostrophic balance in the North
   Atlantic subtropical circulation. The effect of turbines is included in
   the model as additional turbine drag force. The energy equation in the
   system is derived and analyzed both locally and basin-wide. Basin-wide,
   energy production from surface wind stress is balanced by energy
   dissipation from natural friction and turbines. However, the pressure
   gradient is playing an important role in redistributing the energy in
   the local energy balance. It is found that increasing turbine drag does
   not necessarily increase total energy dissipation from turbines. The
   maximum energy dissipation by turbines is estimated to be approximately
   44 GW, although electrical power output will be significantly reduced
   due to various engineering and technological constraints. The turbine
   drag has significant impact on the circulation system. The reduction of
   energy and volume fluxes in the circulation is featured for different
   levels of turbine drag. It is found that residual energy flux along the
   western boundary can be significantly reduced under the peak energy
   dissipation by turbines, while reduction of volume flux is less extreme.}},

Abstract = {{Connectivity requirements are a common component of forest planning
   models, with important examples arising in wildlife habitat protection.
   In harvest scheduling models, one way of addressing preservation
   concerns consists of requiring that large contiguous patches of mature
   forest are maintained. In the context of nature reserve design, it is
   common practice to select a connected region of forest, as a reserve, in
   such a way as to maximize the number of species and habitats protected.
   Although a number of integer programming formulations have been proposed
   for these forest planning problems, most are impractical in that they
   fail to solve reasonably sized scheduling instances. We present a new
   integer programming methodology and test an implementation of it on five
   medium-sized forest instances publicly available in the Forest
   Management Optimization Site repository. Our approach allows us to
   obtain near-optimal solutions for multiple time-period instances in
   fewer than four hours.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed ionic-electronic conductors in the family of
   LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-delta have been widely studied as cathode materials
   for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the long-term stability was

   coating of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-delta (LSM) on the performance of a porous
   La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode. When the thicknesses of the
   LSM coatings are appropriate, an LSM-coated LSCF electrode showed better
   stability and lower polarization (or higher activity) than the blank
   LSCF cathode without LSM infiltration. An anode-supported cell with an
   LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathode demonstrated at 825 degrees C a peak power
   density of similar to 1.07 W/cm(2), about 24\% higher than that of the
   same cell without LSM infiltration (similar to 0.86 W/cm(2)). Further,
   the LSM coating enhanced the stability of the electrode; there was
   little degradation in performance for the cell with an LSM-infiltrated
   LSCF cathode during 100 h operation.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Many analytic results for the connectivity, coverage, and capacity of
   wireless networks have been reported for the case where the number of
   nodes, n, tends to infinity (large-scale networks). The majority of
   these results have not been extended for small or moderate values of n;
   whereas in many practical networks, n is not very large. In this
   article, we consider finite (small-scale) wireless sensor networks. We
   first show that previous asymptotic results provide poor approximations
   for such networks. We provide a set of differences between small-scale
   and large-scale analysis and propose a methodology for analysis of
   finite sensor networks. Furthermore, we consider two models for such
   networks: unreliable sensor grids and sensor networks with random node
   deployment. We provide easily computable expressions for bounds on the
   coverage and connectivity of these networks. With validation from
   simulations, we show that the derived analytic expressions give very
   good estimates of such quantities for finite sensor networks. Our
   investigation confirms the fact that small-scale networks possess unique
   characteristics different from their large-scale counterparts,
   necessitating the development of a new framework for their analysis and
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Data collection is a common operation of wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs). The performance of data collection can be measured by its
   achievable network capacity. However, most existing works focus on the
   network capacity of unicast, multicast or/and broadcast. In this
   article, we study the snapshot/continuous data collection (SDC/CDC)
   problem under the physical interference model for randomly deployed
   dense WSNs. For SDC, we propose a Cell-Based Path Scheduling (CBPS)
   algorithm based on network partitioning. Theoretical analysis shows that
   its achievable network capacity is order-optimal. For CDC, a novel
   Segment-Based Pipeline Scheduling (SBPS) algorithm is proposed which
   combines the pipeline technique and the compressive data gathering
   technique. Theoretical analysis shows that SBPS significantly speeds up
   the CDC process and achieves a high network capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale highly ordered microchannels were spontaneously and rapidly
   created by simply drying the colloidal nanoparticle suspension on a
   rigid substrate. Interestingly, free evaporation of colloidal suspension
   yielded radially aligned microchannels, while constrained evaporation
   that was rendered by the use of confined geometries composed of either
   two nearly parallel plates or a slide placed perpendicular to a rigid
   substrate imparted the formation of periodic arrays of parallel
   microchannels in a controllable manner. The microchannels were formed as
   a result of the competition between stress relaxation due to crack
   opening that ruptured the film and stress increase due to the loss of
   solvent Quite intriguingly, these patterned microchannels can be
   exploited as templates to craft well-ordered metallic stripes. This
   facile and scalable approach may offer a new paradigm of producing
   microscopic patterns over large areas with unprecedented regularity at
   low cost that can serve as scaffolds for use in microelectronics and
   microfluidic-based biochips, among other areas.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a cylindrical rotating triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   based on sliding electrification for harvesting mechanical energy from
   rotational motion. The rotating TENG is based on a core-shell structure
   that is made of distinctly different triboelectric materials with
   alternative strip structures on the surface. The charge transfer is
   strengthened with the formation of polymer nanoparticles on surfaces.
   During coaxial rotation, a contact-induced electrification and the
   relative sliding between the contact surfaces of the core and the shell
   result in an ``in-plane{''} lateral polarization, which drives the flow
   of electrons in the external load. A power density of 36.9 W/m(2)
   (short-circuit current of 90 mu A and open-circuit voltage of 410 V) has
   been achieved by a rotating TENG with 8 strip units at a linear
   rotational velocity of 1.33 m/s (a rotation rate of 1000 r/min). The
   output can be further enhanced by integrating more strip units and/or
   applying larger linear rotational velocity. This rotating TENG can be
   used as a direct power source to drive small electronics, such as LED
   bulbs. This study proves the possibility to harvest mechanical energy by
   TENGs from rotational motion, demonstrating its potential for harvesting
   the flow energy of air or water for applications such as self-powered
   environmental sensors and wildlife tracking devices.}},

Abstract = {{Using the piezoelectric polarization charges created at the metal - GaN
   nanobelt (NB) interface under strain to modulate transport of local
   charge carriers across the Schottky barrier, the piezotronic effect is

   which the GaN NB strain-gated transistors (SGTs) have been fabricated.
   By further assembling and integrating GaN NB SGTs, universal logic
   devices such as NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR gates have been
   demonstrated for performing mechanical - electrical coupled piezotronic
   logic operations. Moreover, basic piezotronic computation such as
   one-bit binary addition over the input mechanical strains with
   corresponding computation results in an electrical domain by half-adder
   has been implemented. The strain-gated piezotronic logic devices may

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomass is the most promising feedstock for biofuels
   production. To enhance the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis,
   lignocellulosics needs to be pretreated to lower their recalcitrance.
   SO2-catalyzed steam explosion is an efficient and relatively
   cost-efficient pretreatment method for softwood. This work investigates
   the effects of steam explosion severity on the digestibility,
   accessibility, and crystallinity of Loblolly pine. Higher severity was
   found to increase the accessibility of the feedstock while also
   promoting nonselective degradation of carbohydrates. The adsorption
   behavior of Celluclast (R) enzymes on steam-exploded Loblolly pine
   (SELP) can be described by a Langmuir isotherm. Cellulose crystallinity
   was found to first increase and then decrease with increasing
   pretreatment severity. A linear relationship between initial hydrolysis
   rates and crystallinity index (CrI) of pretreated Loblolly pine was
   found; moreover, a strong correlation between X-ray diffraction
   intensities and initial rates was confirmed. The findings demonstrate
   the significance of CrI in enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated
   lignocellulosic biomass. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Computational vision-based flame detection has drawn significant
   attention in the past decade with camera surveillance systems becoming
   ubiquitous. Whereas many discriminating features, such as color, shape,
   texture, etc., have been employed in the literature, this paper proposes
   a set of motion features based on motion estimators. The key idea
   consists of exploiting the difference between the turbulent, fast, fire
   motion, and the structured, rigid motion of other objects. Since
   classical optical flow methods do not model the characteristics of fire
   motion (e.g., non-smoothness of motion, non-constancy of intensity), two
   optical flow methods are specifically designed for the fire detection
   task: optimal mass transport models fire with dynamic texture, while a
   data-driven optical flow scheme models saturated flames. Then,
   characteristic features related to the flow magnitudes and directions
   are computed from the flow fields to discriminate between fire and
   non-fire motion. The proposed features are tested on a large video
   database to demonstrate their practical usefulness. Moreover, a novel
   evaluation method is proposed by fire simulations that allow for a
   controlled environment to analyze parameter influences, such as flame
   saturation, spatial resolution, frame rate, and random noise.}},

Abstract = {{Lycopene is a phytochemical that belongs to a group of pigments known as
   carotenoids. It is red, lipophilic and naturally occurring in many
   fruits and vegetables, with tomatoes and tomato-based products
   containing the highest concentrations of bioavailable lycopene. Several
   epidemiological studies have linked increased lycopene consumption with
   decreased prostate cancer risk. These findings are supported by in vitro
   and in vivo experiments showing that lycopene not only enhances the
   antioxidant response of prostate cells, but that it is even able to
   inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and decrease the metastatic
   capacity of prostate cancer cells. However, there is still no clearly
   proven clinical evidence supporting the use of lycopene in the
   prevention or treatment of prostate cancer, due to the only limited
   number of published randomized clinical trials and the varying quality
   of existing studies. The scope of this article is to discuss the
   potential impact of lycopene on prostate cancer by giving an overview
   about its molecular mechanisms and clinical effects.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach is presented for obtaining fast robust
   three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of bioluminescent reporters
   buried deep inside animal subjects from multispectral images of surface
   bioluminescent photon densities. The proposed method iteratively acts
   upon the equations relating the multispectral data to the luminescent
   distribution with high computational efficiency to provide robust 3-D
   reconstructions. Unlike existing algebraic reconstruction techniques,
   the proposed method is designed to use adaptive projections that
   iteratively guide the updates to the solution with improved speed and
   robustness. Contrary to least-squares reconstruction methods, the
   proposed technique does not require parameter selection or optimization
   for optimal performance. Additionally, optimized schemes for
   thresholding, sampling, and ordering of the bioluminescence tomographic
   data used by the proposed method are presented. The performance of the
   proposed approach in reconstructing the shape, volume, flux, and depth
   of luminescent inclusions is evaluated in a multitude of phantom-based
   and dual-modality in vivo studies in which calibrated sources are
   implanted in animal subjects and imaged in a dual-modality
   optical/computed tomography platform. Statistical analysis of the errors
   in the depth and flux of the reconstructed inclusions and the
   convergence time of the proposed method is used to demonstrate its
   unbiased performance, low error variance, and computational efficiency.

Abstract = {{In the early stages of aeroshell shape design, it is important to strike
   an appropriate balance between analysis fidelity and computational
   effort. Because the prediction of aerodynamic heating for axisymmetric
   flows is significantly faster than for three-dimensional flows, it is
   advantageous to employ an axisymmetric analysis method. The current work
   couples an equivalent axisymmetric body technique with different
   axisymmetric analysis methods, using a series of axisymmetric bodies to
   approximate the three-dimensional heating. Three levels of fidelity are
   considered: 1) a Newtonian inviscid solution coupled with an
   axisymmetric integral boundary layer approach, 2) an Euler solution
   coupled with an axisymmetric integral boundary-layer approach, and 3) a
   Navier Stokes solution applied to each equivalent axisymmetric body.
   Approximate solutions for three-dimensional flows were compared with
   high-fidelity computational and experimental data, establishing the
   accuracy for various levels of fidelity. The multi-fidelity analysis
   showed that significant decreases in computational times could be
   achieved, at the same time maintaining sufficient accuracy to perform
   shape optimization.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{The propulsive-aerodynamic interactions of a vehicle undergoing
   supersonic retropropulsion are heavily dependent on the configuration of
   the nozzles and their integration with the vehicle. Knowledge of the
   interaction effects is gained from wind-tunnel results as well as
   computational fluid dynamics simulations. Because of the complex
   flowfield structures created by a vehicle employing supersonic
   retropropulsion, there are significant time and computational resource
   requirements to generate solutions for a particular configuration under
   specific flow conditions. Analytical flowfield models allow for
   preliminary information regarding flow structure to be available with
   minimal computational resources. By using these analytical models in the
   design process, the efficiency at which these studies can be performed
   can be improved by reducing the design space of nonfavorable designs and
   illustrating scenarios for higher-fidelity analysis. This paper proposes
   a method for analytically describing the plume boundaries present for
   two supersonic retropropulsion configurations: a single-nozzle and a
   three-nozzle configuration. The method is based on previous work on
   plume boundaries with modifications to account for the effects of a
   supersonic freestream. Comparisons with experimental data and
   computational simulations verify the model results for both
   configurations at Mach 2 and angle of attack of zero.}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed to evaluate the thermal conductivity of
   semiconducting compounds as a function of their atomistic structures
   during phase transformations induced by mechanical loading. The approach
   uses atomistic configurational information and interatomic interactions
   as input. The harmonic and anharmonic behaviors of phonons are captured
   through force constants which are sensitive to structural changes. The
   calculations focus on changes in thermal conductivity of GaN nanowires
   in response to deformation and phase transformation. Results show that
   the model yields results consistent with data obtained using the
   Green-Kubo method and is 50 times more efficient than calculations based
   on molecular dynamics. (C) 2013 Author(s). All article content, except

Abstract = {{Using long wave theory and direct numerical solutions of the
   Navier-Stokes equations, we investigate thermocapillary flows arising in
   a thin liquid film covering a heated solid substrate with non-uniform
   temperature in the form of traveling thermal waves. Our results indicate
   that unidirectionally propagating interfacial waves are formed in the
   liquid film. The interfacial waves transport liquid, thereby creating a
   net pumping effect. We show that the frequency of thermal waves leading
   to the most efficient pumping is defined by their wave length and weakly
   depends on other system parameters. The results are useful for designing
   new methods for transporting liquids in open microfluidic devices. (C)

Abstract = {{A complex role has been described for dendritic cells (DCs) in the
   potentiation and control of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.
   Resident vascular DCs are found in the intima of atherosclerosis-prone
   vascular regions exposed to disturbed blood flow patterns. Several
   phenotypically and functionally distinct vascular DC subsets have been
   described. The functional heterogeneity of these cells and their
   contributions to vascular homeostasis, inflammation, and atherosclerosis
   are only recently beginning to emerge. Here, we review the available
   literature, characterizing the origin and function of known vascular DC
   subsets and their important role contributing to the balance of immune
   activation and immune tolerance governing vascular homeostasis under
   healthy conditions. We then discuss how homeostatic DC functions are
   disrupted during atherogenesis, leading to atherosclerosis. The
   effectiveness of DC-based ``atherosclerosis vaccine{''} therapies in the
   treatment of atherosclerosis is also reviewed. We further provide
   suggestions for distinguishing DCs from macrophages and discuss
   important future directions for the field.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing concerns over limited petroleum resources and associated
   environmental problems are motivating the development of efficient cell
   factories to produce chemicals, fuels, and materials from renewable
   resources in an environmentally sustainable economical manner. Bacillus
   spp., the best characterized Gram-positive bacteria, possesses unique
   advantages as a host for producing microbial enzymes and industrially
   important biochemicals. With appropriate modifications to heterologous
   protein expression and metabolic engineering, Bacillus species are
   favorable industrial candidates for efficiently converting renewable
   resources to microbial enzymes, fine chemicals, bulk chemicals, and
   fuels. Here, we summarize the recent advances in developing Bacillus
   spp. as a cell factory. We review the available genetic tools,
   engineering strategies, genome sequence, genome-scale structure models,
   proteome, and secretion pathways, and we list successful examples of
   enzymes and industrially important biochemicals produced by Bacillus
   spp. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges in
   developing Bacillus spp. as a robust and efficient production host, and
   we discuss in the context of systems and synthetic biology the emerging
   opportunities and future research prospects in developing Bacillus spp.

Abstract = {{Glucosamine (GlcN), an amino sugar, is a compound derived from
   substitution of a hydroxyl group of a glucose molecule with an amino
   group. GlcN and its acetylated derivative, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc),
   have been widely used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries
   and are currently produced by acid hydrolysis of chitin (a linear
   polymer of GlcNAc) extracted from crab and shrimp shells. Microbial
   fermentation by filamentous fungi or recombinant Escherichia coli, as an
   alternative method for the production of GlcN and GlcNAc, is attracting
   increasing attention because it is an environmentally friendly process.
   Although the microbial production of GlcN and GlcNAc is hampered by low
   yield and high production cost, considerable advances have been made in
   recent years. Here we review the applications, commercial market, and

Abstract = {{Motivation: Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to an RNA
   molecule. Identifying DNA sequence motifs that signal the addition of
   poly(A) tails is essential to improved genome annotation and better
   understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and stability of mRNA.
   Existing poly(A) motif predictors demonstrate that information extracted
   from the surrounding nucleotide sequences of candidate poly(A) motifs
   can differentiate true motifs from the false ones to a great extent. A
   variety of sophisticated features has been explored, including
   sequential, structural, statistical, thermodynamic and evolutionary
   properties. However, most of these methods involve extensive manual
   feature engineering, which can be time-consuming and can require
   in-depth domain knowledge.
   Results: We propose a novel machine-learning method for poly(A) motif
   prediction by marrying generative learning (hidden Markov models) and
   discriminative learning (support vector machines). Generative learning
   provides a rich palette on which the uncertainty and diversity of
   sequence information can be handled, while discriminative learning
   allows the performance of the classification task to be directly
   optimized. Here, we used hidden Markov models for fitting the DNA
   sequence dynamics, and developed an efficient spectral algorithm for
   extracting latent variable information from these models. These spectral
   latent features were then fed into support vector machines to fine-tune
   the classification performance.
   We evaluated our proposed method on a comprehensive human poly(A)
   dataset that consists of 14 740 samples from 12 of the most abundant
   variants of human poly(A) motifs. Compared with one of the previous
   state-of-the-art methods in the literature (the random forest model with
   expert-crafted features), our method reduces the average error rate,
   false-negative rate and false-positive rate by 26, 15 and 35\%,
   respectively. Meanwhile, our method makes similar to 30\% fewer error
   predictions relative to the other string kernels. Furthermore, our
   method can be used to visualize the importance of oligomers and
   positions in predicting poly(A) motifs, from which we can observe a
   number of characteristics in the surrounding regions of true and false
   motifs that have not been reported before.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a fully integrated low-power transceiver for
   wideband near-field data transmission across inductive telemetry links
   based on pulse harmonic modulation (PHM). This PHM transceiver uses two
   narrow pulses with specific amplitudes and timing at the transmitter
   (Tx) to suppress intersymbol interference (ISI) at the receiver (Rx)
   high-Q LC tank to achieve high data rates (DRs) without reducing the
   inductive link quality factor to extend its bandwidth. This method
   significantly improves the range and selectivity of the link. The PHM Rx
   architecture is based on noncoherent energy detection utilizing a novel
   pulse-based automatic gain control circuit, which significantly reduces
   the power consumption (46\%) and ISI at short coupling distances. The
   PHM transceiver was fabricated in a 0.35-mu m standard CMOS process and
   achieved a measured DR of 20 Mb/s with a bit error rate of 8.7 x 10(-8)
   at a 10-mm distance using planar figure-8 coils. The PHM Tx and Rx power
   consumptions were 180 and 12.15 pJ/bit, respectively, at a 1.8-V supply

Abstract = {{During the past 30 years, one of the major accomplishments in ocean
   acoustics is the improvement of understanding seabed scattering,
   resulting from a significant effort of both at-sea measurement and
   theoretical modeling. {[}Jackson and Richardson: High-Frequency Seafloor
   Acoustics, 2007]. Benefiting from this accomplishment, this paper
   integrates the energy flux method for shallow-water (SW) reverberation
   {[}Zhou, (Chinese) Acta Acust. 5, 86-99 (1980)] with the physics-based
   seabed scattering models. This integration directly and intuitively
   results in general expressions for SW reverberation in the angular and
   modal domains. The latter expression is the same as the modal
   reverberation expression derived from the Green's function and boundary
   perturbation method by Tracey and Schmidt {[}IEEE J. Ocean. Eng. 22,
   317-331(1997)]. The integration also results in a simple relationship
   between the classic boundary scattering cross sections and the modal
   scattering matrix in SW waveguides. The bottom roughness spectrum and
   sediment volume scattering cross section at low grazing angles are
   inverted in a frequency range of 150-2500 Hz from the wideband
   long-range reverberation data by using the Biot seabed geoacoustic
   model. The results may offer some reference data sets for future
   analysis of the low-frequency seabed scattering mechanisms. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Effective communication between staff members is key to patient safety
   in hospitals. A variety of patient care activities including admittance,
   evaluation, and treatment rely on oral communication. Surprisingly,
   published information on speech intelligibility in hospitals is
   extremely limited. In this study, speech intelligibility measurements
   and occupant evaluations were conducted in 20 units of five different
   U.S. hospitals. A variety of unit types and locations were studied.
   Results show that overall, no unit had ``good{''} intelligibility based
   on the speech intelligibility index (SII > 0.75) and several locations
   found to have ``poor{''} intelligibility (SII < 0.45). Further, occupied
   spaces were found to have 10\%-15\% lower SII than unoccupied spaces on
   average. Additionally, staff perception of communication problems at
   nurse stations was significantly correlated with SII ratings. In a
   targeted second phase, a unit treated with sound absorption had higher
   SII ratings for a larger percentage of time as compared to an identical
   untreated unit. Taken as a whole, the study provides an extensive
   baseline evaluation of speech intelligibility across a variety of
   hospitals and unit types, offers some evidence of the positive impact of
   absorption on intelligibility, and identifies areas for future research.

Abstract = {{There are substantial uncertainties in the computational models
   currently used to predict the heating environment and the Thermal
   Protection System material response during Mars entry. Flight data are
   required to quantify and possibly reduce such uncertainties as well as
   improve current computational tools. The Mars Science Laboratory Entry,
   Descent, and Landing Instrumentation suite will provide a comprehensive
   set of flight data that will include subsurface temperature measurements
   of its Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator heatshield at different
   locations. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   time-dependent estimation of Mars Science Laboratory surface heating
   from simulated Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent, and Landing
   Instrumentation temperature data using inverse methods in the presence
   of random and bias measurement and model errors. The surface heat flux
   is indirectly reconstructed by estimating the discretized heat transfer
   coefficient profile as a function of time. Whole-time domain
   least-squares methods in conjunction with the Tikhonov regularization
   technique are applied to this problem. The performance of the estimation
   methods and the accuracy of the reconstructed surface conditions are
   investigated under different types of errors in the measurements, such
   as random noise and thermocouple lag. Furthermore, the effect of
   material property bias on the estimation of surface conditions is also
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal was to identify evolutionary conserved frame transitions in
   protein coding regions and to uncover an underlying functional role of
   these structural aberrations. We used the ab initio frameshift
   prediction program, GeneTack, to detect reading frame transitions in 206
   991 genes (fs-genes) from 1106 complete prokaryotic genomes. We grouped
   102 731 fs-genes into 19 430 clusters based on sequence similarity
   between protein products (fs-proteins) as well as conservation of
   predicted position of the frameshift and its direction. We identified
   4010 pseudogene clusters and 146 clusters of fs-genes apparently using
   recoding (local deviation from using standard genetic code) due to
   possessing specific sequence motifs near frameshift positions.
   Particularly interesting was finding of a novel type of organization of
   the dnaX gene, where recoding is required for synthesis of the longer
   subunit, tau. We selected 20 clusters of predicted recoding candidates
   and designed a series of genetic constructs with a reporter gene or
   affinity tag whose expression would require a frameshift event.
   Expression of the constructs in Escherichia coli demonstrated enrichment
   of the set of candidates with sequences that trigger genuine programmed
   ribosomal frameshifting; we have experimentally confirmed four new
   families of programmed frameshifts.}},

Abstract = {{The wall -potential (w), the potential at the shear plane of the
   electric double layer, depends on the properties of the BGE solution
   such as the valence and type of electrolyte, the pH and the ionic
   strength. Most of the methods estimate (w) from measurements of the EOF
   velocity magnitude u(eo), usually spatially averaged over the entire
   capillary. In these initial studies, evanescent-wave particle
   velocimetry was used to measure u(eo) in steady EOF for a variety of
   monovalent aqueous solutions to evaluate the effect of small amounts of
   divalent cations, as well as the pH and ionic strength of BGE solutions.
   In brief, the magnitude of the EOF velocity of NaCl-NaOH and borate
   buffer-NaOH solutions was estimated from the measured velocities of
   radius = 104 nm fluorescent polystyrene particles in 33 m fused-silica
   microchannels. The particle -potentials were measured separately using
   laser-Doppler micro-electrophoresis; (w) was then determined from u(eo).
   The results suggest that evanescent-wave particle velocimetry can be
   used to estimate (w) for a variety of BGE solutions, and that it can be
   used in the future to estimate local wall -potential, and hence spatial
   variations in zeta(w.)}},

Abstract = {{Prognostics involves the effective utilization of condition or
   performance-based sensor signals to accurately estimate the remaining
   lifetime of partially degraded systems and components. The rapid
   development of sensor technology, has led to the use of multiple sensors
   to monitor the condition of an engineering system. It is therefore
   important to develop methodologies capable of integrating data from
   multiple sensors with the goal of improving the accuracy of predicting
   remaining lifetime. Although numerous efforts have focused on developing
   feature-level and decision-level fusion methodologies for prognostics,
   little research has targeted the development of ``data-level{''} fusion
   models. In this paper, we present a methodology for constructing a
   composite health index for characterizing the performance of a system
   through the fusion of multiple degradation-based sensor data. This
   methodology includes data selection, data processing, and data fusion
   steps that lead to an improved degradation-based prognostic model. Our
   goal is that the composite health index provides a much better
   characterization of the condition of a system compared to relying solely
   on data from an individual sensor. Our methodology was evaluated through
   a case study involving a degradation dataset of an aircraft gas turbine
   engine that was generated by the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion
   System Simulation (C-MAPSS).}},

Abstract = {{The use of passive ultra high-frequency (UHF) radio frequency
   identification (RFID) integrated into plywood boards is proposed to
   enable the identification and tracking of individual plywood boards and
   end products of plywood. For the first time, tags are embeddable inside
   plywood by direct inkjet-printing tag antennas on pure birch veneer. The
   use of passive UHF RFID technology in the applications of plywood
   industry is discussed, two tag antenna designs for plywood are presented
   and the tag fabrication procedures are described. Furthermore, results
   from tag performance measurements performed in the authentic application
   environment as well as in anechoic conditions are presented and
   discussed. Measurements show that tags printed on veneer and embedded
   inside 2 mm thick plywood board exhibited theoretical read ranges from
   7.9 to 10.1 meters. The read ranges obtained meet the demands of the
   plywood industry and offer reliable identification even in challenging
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale Pt-Ni bimetallic octahedra with controlled sizes have been
   actively explored in recent years owning to their outstanding activity
   for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here we report the synthesis of
   uniform 9 nm Pt-Ni octahedra with the use of oleylamine and oleic acid
   as surfactants and W(CO)(6) as a source of CO that can promote the
   formation of \{111\} facets in the presence of Ni. Through the
   introduction of benzyl ether as a solvent, the coverage of both
   surfactants on the surface of resultant Pt-Ni octahedra was
   significantly reduced while the octahedral shape was still attained. By
   further removing the surfactants through acetic acid treatment, we
   observed a specific activity 51-fold higher than that of the
   state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst for the ORR at 0.93 V, together with a
   record high mass activity of 3.3 A mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9 V (the highest mass
   activity reported in the literature was 1.45 A mg(Pt)(-1)). Our analysis
   suggests that this great enhancement of ORR activity could be attributed
   to the presence of a clean, well-preserved (111) surface for the Pt-Ni
   octahedra.}},

Abstract = {{One of the limitations of thermal reconfiguration in silicon photonics
   is its slow response time. At the same time, there is a tradeoff between
   the reconfiguration speed and power consumption in conventional
   reconfiguration schemes that poses a challenge in improving the
   performance of microheaters. In this work, we theoretically and
   experimentally demonstrate that the high thermal conductivity of silicon
   can be exploited to tackle this tradeoff through direct pulsed
   excitation of the device silicon layer. We demonstrate 85 ns
   reconfiguration of 4 hmpm diameter microdisks, which is one order of
   magnitude improvement over the conventional microheaters. At the same
   time, 2.06 nm/mW resonance wavelength shift is achieved in these
   devices, which is in a par with the best microheater architectures
   optimized for low-power operation. We also present a system-level model
   that precisely describes the response of the demonstrated microheaters.
   A differentially addressed optical switch is also demonstrated that
   shows the possibility of switching in opposite directions (i.e.,
   OFF-to-ON and ON-to-OFF) using the proposed reconfiguration scheme. (C)

Abstract = {{Ring crack initiation loads on glass, using spherical Tungsten carbide
   (WC) and glass (G) indenters, are measured and analysed. Our
   measurements demonstrate that environmental humidity plays a key role in
   determining the load to fracture; experiments conducted without
   controlling this variable cannot be used to obtain material properties.
   The role of friction is explicitly considered for dissimilar (WC-G)
   elastic contacts. For this material pair, the stresses at fracture are
   well described by a boundary lubrication value of friction coefficient.
   The fracture loads are used in a fracture-mechanics formulation to
   calculate crack sizes on glass surfaces. The searched-area' concept for
   dissimilar contacts is described, and used to provide crack density
   values for these surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Hubs of rotating systems have a significant contribution to the total
   vehicle parasite drag. The complexity of hub configurations and of the
   flows around them leads to large uncertainty in drag prediction at the
   design stage, which inhibits the development of advanced concepts. A
   generic, modular hub configuration is used in a wind tunnel to
   deconstruct and resolve drag contributions, and to reduce the
   uncertainty in prediction and measurement. Predictions are made with the
   same configuration, including tunnel walls and support structure in flow
   field computations, using an overset, unstructured Navier-Stokes
   approach with mesh adaptation. A progression of results is presented;
   surface pressure calculations are used to compute integrated drag on the
   non-rotating and rotating configurations at various levels of assembly.
   These calculations are also used to extract interaction effects and
   causal physics. Experimental and computational wake velocity fields are
   compared for velocity deficits and shear layers. Measured and computed
   velocity profiles and turbulence spectra measurements in the hub near
   wake (0.5-1.0 hub diameters) correlate well when proper fidelity of
   grid, time step, and turbulence model are chosen. The wake spectral
   content is characterized by broadband turbulence in addition to large
   scale spectral content energizing the flow field. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microcosms containing sediment from an aquifer in Cambodia with
   naturally elevated levels of arsenic in the associated groundwater were
   used to evaluate the effectiveness of microbially mediated production of
   iron minerals for in situ As remediation. The microcosms were first
   incubated without amendments for 28 days, and the release of As and
   other geogenic chemicals from the sediments into the aqueous phase was
   monitored. Nitrate or a mixture of sulfate and lactate was then added to
   stimulate biological Fe(II) oxidation or sulfate reduction,
   respectively. Without treatment, soluble As concentrations reached 3.9
   +/- 0.9 mu M at the end of the 143-day experiment. However, in the
   nitrate- and sulfate-plus-lactate-amended microcosms, soluble As levels
   decreased to 0.01 and 0.41 +/- 0.13 mu M, respectively, by the end of
   the experiment. Analyses using a range of biogeochemical and
   mineralogical tools indicated that sorption onto freshly formed hydrous
   ferric oxide (HFO) and iron sulfide mineral phases are the likely
   mechanisms for As removal in the respective treatments. Incorporation of
   the experimental results into a one-dimensional transport-reaction model
   suggests that, under conditions representative of the Cambodian aquifer,
   the in situ precipitation of HFO would be effective in bringing
   groundwater into compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO)
   provisional guideline value for As (10 ppb or 0.13 mu M), although
   soluble Mn release accompanying microbial Fe(II) oxidation presents a
   potential health concern. In contrast, production of biogenic iron
   sulfide minerals would not remediate the groundwater As concentration
   below the recommended WHO limit.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the site-saturation engineering of lysine 47 in
   cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from Paenibacillus macerans
   was conducted to improve the specificity of CGTase towards maltodextrin,
   which can be used as a cheap and easily soluble glycosyl donor for the
   enzymatic synthesis of 2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G) by
   CGTase. When using maltodextrin as glycosyl donor, four mutants K47F
   (lysine -> phenylalanine), K47L (lysine -> leucine), K47V (lysine ->
   valine) and K47W (lysine -> tryptophan) showed higher AA-2G yield as
   compared with that produced by the wild-type CGTase. The transformation
   conditions (temperature, pH and the mass ratio of L-ascorbic acid to
   maltodextrin) were optimized and the highest titer of AA-2G produced by
   the mutant K47L could reach 1.97 g/l, which was 64.2 \% higher than that
   (1.20 g/l) produced by the wildtype CGTase. The reaction kinetics
   analysis confirmed the enhanced maltodextrin specificity, and it was
   also found that compared with the wild-type CGTase, the four mutants had
   relatively lower cyclization activities and higher disproportionation
   activities, which was favorable for AA-2G synthesis. The mechanism
   responsible for the enhanced substrate specificity was further explored
   by structure modeling and it was indicated that the enhancement of
   maltodextrin specificity may be due to the short residue chain and the
   removal of hydrogen bonding interactions between the side chain of
   residue 47 and the sugar at -3 subsite. Here the obtained mutant
   CGTases, especially the K47L, has a great potential in the production of
   AA-2G with maltodextrin as a cheap and easily soluble substrate.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of partitioning an area in the plane populated
   by a team of aerial/marine vehicles into a finite collection of
   non-overlapping sets. The sets of this partition are in an one-to-one
   correspondence with the vehicles under the following rule: each point in
   the given set of the partition can be reached by the corresponding
   vehicle in this set faster than any other vehicle in the presence of a
   spatiotemporal drift field. Consequently, a Voronoi-like partition
   results, which encodes the proximity relations between the vehicles and
   arbitrary points in the plane with respect to the minimum time-to-go.
   The construction of this Voronoi-like partition is based on its
   interpretation as the intersection of a forest of the cost (minimum
   time-to-go) surfaces emanating from each generator with their common
   lower envelope. The characterization of each cost surface is achieved by
   means of an efficient expansion scheme of the level sets of the minimum
   time-to-go function, which utilizes, in turn, the structure of the
   optimal synthesis of the minimum-time problem without resorting to
   exhaustive numerical techniques, e.g., fast marching methods. We examine
   the topological characteristics of the partition by using control/system
   theoretic concepts and tools. The theoretical developments are
   illustrated with a number of numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide emitted from existing coal-fired power plants is a major
   environmental concern due to possible links to global climate change. In
   this study, we expand upon previous work focused on
   aminosilane-functionalized polymeric hollow-fiber sorbents by
   introducing a new class of polyethyleneimine (PEI)-functionalized
   polymeric hollow-fiber sorbents for post-combustion carbon dioxide
   capture. Different molecular weight PEIs (M-n approximate to 600, 1800,
   10000, and 60000) were studied as functional groups on polyamide imide
   (PAI, Torlon) hollow fibers. This imide ring-opening modification
   introduces two amide functional groups and was confirmed by FTIR
   attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy. The carbon dioxide
   equilibrium sorption capacities of PEI-functionalized Torlon materials
   were characterized by using both pressure decay and gravimetric sorption
   methods. For equivalent PEI concentrations, PAI functionalized with
   lower molecular weight PEI exhibited higher carbon dioxide capacities.
   The effect of water in the ring-opening reaction was also studied. Up to
   a critical value, water in the reaction mixture enhanced the degree of
   functionalization of PEI to Torlon and resulted in higher carbon dioxide
   uptake within the functionalized material. Above the critical value,
   roughly 15\% w/w water, the fiber morphology was lost and the fiber was
   soluble in the solvent. PEI-functionalized (M-n approximate to 600) PAI
   under optimal reaction conditions was observed to have the highest CO2
   uptake: 4.9g CO2 per 100g of polymer (1.1mmolg(-1)) at 0.1bar and 35
   degrees C with dry 10\% CO2/90\% N-2 feed for thermogravimetric
   analysis. By using water-saturated feeds (10\% CO2/90\% N-2 dry basis),
   CO2 sorption was observed to increase to 6.0g CO2 per 100g of sorbent
   (1.4mmolg(-1)). This material also demonstrated stability in cyclic
   adsorption-desorption operations, even under wet conditions at which
   some highly effective sorbents tend to lose performance. Thus,
   PEI-functionalized PAI fibers can be considered as promising material
   for post-combustion CO2 capture.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous seismic velocity measurements use a special automated wave
   source and advanced post-processing analyses to provide fast, detailed,
   and reliable profiles of shear wave velocity (Vs) with depth.
   Conventional geophysical techniques such as crosshole tests (CHTs) and
   downhole tests (DHTs) in boreholes are slow because they have several
   required steps: (1) rotary drilling, (2) installation of casing and
   grouting, (3) inclinometer measurements (for CHTs), and (4) deployment
   of geophones for seismic readings. Direct-push technologies include the
   use of seismic cones and seismic dilatometers that offer DHT-type V-s
   data at intervals of 1 m or less without the need for drilling, casing,
   grouting, or separate field events. The recent development of a new
   portable autoseis source allows the generation of reliable and
   consistent shear waves either intermittently or as frequently as every 1
   to 10 s. Continuous shear wave measurements can provide improved
   detailing of the small-strain stiffness (G(0)) at frequent depth
   intervals and fast field production times. Appreciable sensitivity
   errors in V-s calculations can be experienced because of the extremely
   small time shifts between adjacent shear wave records, as well as
   significant signal noise due to vibration, external sources, and
   refracted waves. This paper details continuous-interval seismic
   piezocone testing and explains how to handle signal post-processing in
   both the time domain and the spectral frequency domain in order to
   obtain a reliable in situ V-s profile.}},

Abstract = {{We developed superhydrophobic (SH) silica/epoxy nanocomposite coating as
   an encapsulant to improve device reliability. The SH surface was
   generated by spin-coating of a silica/epoxy nanocomposite, followed by
   an oxygen reactive ion etching that exposes silica nanostructures for
   high surface roughness, and a subsequent hydrophobic treatment for low
   surface energy. As a result, a water contact angle of 161.2 degrees and
   a contact angle hysteresis of 1.7 degrees were achieved under an
   optimized condition. Such SH coating showed good stability under
   humidity at elevated temperatures and was applied on the triple track
   resistor (TTR) test coupons. It is found that the self-cleaning
   encapsulant successfully improves the test device reliability, and the
   coated TTR showed less degradation of resistance and leakage current in
   the temperature humidity bias test. In addition, the effect of different
   types of epoxy resin on reliability improvement was studied.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in neural interfacing technology are required to enable
   natural, thought-driven control of a prosthetic limb. Here, we describe
   a regenerative electrode design in which a polymer-based thin-film
   electrode array is integrated within a thin-film sheet of aligned
   nanofibers, such that axons regenerating from a transected peripheral
   nerve are topographically guided across the electrode recording sites.
   Cultures of dorsal root ganglia were used to explore design parameters
   leading to cellular migration and neurite extension across the
   nanofiber/electrode array boundary. Regenerative scaffold electrodes
   (RSEs) were subsequently fabricated and implanted across rat tibial
   nerve gaps to evaluate device recording capabilities and influence on
   nerve regeneration. In 20 of these animals, regeneration was compared
   between a conventional nerve gap model and an amputation model.
   Characteristic shaping of regenerated nerve morphology around the
   embedded electrode array was observed in both groups, and regenerated
   axon profile counts were similar at the eight week end point. Implanted
   RSEs recorded evoked neural activity in all of these cases, and also in
   separate implantations lasting up to five months. These results
   demonstrate that nanofiber-based topographic cues within a regenerative
   electrode can influence nerve regeneration, to the potential benefit of
   a peripheral nerve interface suitable for limb amputees.}},

Abstract = {{Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is among the most prevalent and
   significant valve problems in the Western world. Echocardiography plays
   a significant role in the diagnosis of degenerative valve disease.
   However, a simple and accurate means of quantifying MR has eluded both
   the technical and clinical ultrasound communities. Perhaps the best
   clinically accepted method used today is the 2-D proximal isovelocity
   surface area (PISA) method. In this study, a new quantification method
   using 3-D color Doppler ultrasound, called the field optimization method
   (FOM), is described. For each 3-D color flow volume, this method
   iterates on a simple fluid dynamics model that, when processed by a
   model of ultrasound physics, attempts to agree with the observed
   velocities in a least-squares sense. The output of this model is an
   estimate of the regurgitant flow and the location of its associated
   orifice.
   To validate the new method, in vitro experiments were performed using a
   pulsatile flow loop and different geometric orifices. Measurements from
   the FOM and from 2-D PISA were compared with measurements made with a
   calibrated ultrasonic flow probe. Results show that the new method has a
   higher correlation to the truth data and has lower inter- and
   intra-observer variability than the 2-D PISA method.}},

Title = {{Frame-based Poisson image restoration using a proximal linearized
   alternating direction method}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The restoration problem for Poissonian images, arising in medical and
   astronomical applications, is an active research area. The associated
   optimization models are quite challenging since the fidelity term of the
   problem is not a quadratic function and the regularizer is usually
   nonsmooth. Recently, the augmented Lagrangian-based alternating
   direction method has been proposed to solve the
   total-variation-regularized convex model, frame-based analysis model and
   frame-based synthesis model. In this paper, we propose a frame-based
   balanced Poisson image restoration model and a proximal linearized
   alternating direction (PLAD) method to solve the proposed model. Unlike
   the augmented Lagrangian-based alternating direction method, the
   proposed PLAD algorithm does not require any inner iterations or
   inverses due to the replacement of the quadratic term of the augmented
   function by the sum of its linearization and the proximal function. We
   establish global convergence under mild conditions. The proposed method
   is highly parallelizable and it is thus suitable for large-scale image
   restoration problems. Numerical results show that the proposed
   framework, i.e., frame-based balanced model and the PLAD method
   outperforms analysis and synthesis models for Poisson image restoration
   problems in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the flight simulation and control of a flexible aircraft
   in landing is presented. The discrete form of hybrid-state equations of
   motion in terms of quasi coordinates takes into account the coupling
   between elastic and rigid-body degrees of freedom and provides the
   framework for the controller design and simulation. The wings of the
   aircraft are modeled as cantilever beams undergoing bending and torsion
   about their elastic axis. Distributed variables are discretized in space
   using the Galerkin method, and unsteady aerodynamic forces are computed
   using strip theory and finite state induced-flow theory. A landing
   condition in which the elastic aircraft encounters a crosswind all the
   way before touchdown is considered. To design the control system,
   nonlinear coupled equations of motion are linearized about the trim
   condition and separated into two sets of decoupled equations, in which
   the elastic variables affect lateral-directional equations. The landing
   phase is divided into the final approach and flare phases and, for each
   phase, separate controllers are designed for longitudinal- and
   lateral-directional channels. An optimali-ntegral feedforward control
   scheme is implemented to accomplish the autolanding, while suppressing
   the wind effects on the flight path. The performance of the control
   system is examined through nonlinear simulation.}},

   prescribed target set in the presence of a stochastically varying wind.
   First, two analytically-derived control laws are presented. One control
   law does not consider the presence of the wind, whereas the other
   assumes that the wind is constant and known a priori. In the latter case
   it is assumed that the prevailing wind is equal to its mean value; no
   information about the variations of the wind speed and direction is
   available. Next, by employing numerical techniques from stochastic
   optimal control, feedback control strategies are computed. These
   anticipate the stochastic variation of the wind and drive the vehicle to
   its target set while minimizing the expected time of arrival. The
   analysis and numerical simulations show that the analytically-derived
   deterministic optimal control for this problem captures, in many cases,
   the salient features of the optimal feedback control for the stochastic
   wind model, providing support for the use of the former in the presence
   of light winds. On the other hand, the controllers anticipating the
   stochastic wind variation lead to more robust and more predictable
   trajectories than the ones obtained using feedback controllers for
   deterministic wind models.}},

Abstract = {{The invention of the steerable, gliding, ram-air parafoil enabled the
   possibility of precision, autonomous aerial payload delivery. Research
   and development work on guided airdrop systems has focused primarily on
   evolutionary improvements to the guidance algorithm, although the
   navigation and control algorithms have changed little since the initial
   autonomous systems were developed. Recent work has demonstrated the
   potential for dramatic improvements in landing accuracy through the
   incorporation of canopy incidence variation to achieve glide slope
   control for parafoils. The current work presents the development of a
   control law to implement glide slope control on an autonomous airdrop
   system. Autonomous landings with the control law in both simulation and
   flight test demonstrate an improvement in landing accuracy by a factor
   of two, though the improvement can be even greater in especially windy
   conditions. Finally, the ability to perform in-flight system
   identification to adapt internal control mappings to match flight data
   and provide dramatic improvements in landing accuracy when there is a
   significant discrepancy between the assumed and actual flight
   characteristics is demonstrated in both simulation and flight test.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents control algorithms for guidance and control of

   presented control and guidance algorithms are validated through
   experimentation on the Georgia Institute of Technology Twinstar twin

   include sudden loss of all aerodynamic actuators resulting in
   propulsion-only flight, 25\% of the left wing missing, sudden loss of
   50\% of the right wing and aileron in-flight, and injected actuator time
   delay. A state-dependent guidance logic is described that ensures the
   aircraft tracks feasible commands in the presence of faults. The
   commands are used by an outer-loop linear controller to generate
   feasible attitude commands. The inner-loop attitude control can be
   achieved by using either a linear attitude controller or a neural
   network-based model reference adaptive controller. The results indicate
   the possibility of using control methods to ensure safe autonomous

Title = {{Implementation of a multisource model for gold nanoparticle-mediated
   plasmonic heating with near-infrared laser by the finite element method}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The use of optically tunable gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in
   conjunction with near-infrared (NIR) laser has emerged as an attractive
   option for laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT), as it capitalizes on
   plasmonic heating of GNPs tuned to absorb light strongly in the NIR
   region. Previously, the authors developed a multisource model to predict
   the temperature change in a GNP-laden tissue-like medium illuminated by
   NIR laser and implemented it by a linear superposition (LS) method
   combining analytic and finite element method (FEM) solutions. While it
   is intuitive and straightforward, the LS approach might be somewhat
   cumbersome to implement for realistic LITT cases because it requires
   separate calculations of the temperature change due to individual GNP
   heat sources and the laser heat source. Therefore, the current
   investigation aimed to develop a simpler yet mathematically more elegant
   and computationally more efficient method solely based on FEM to
   implement the authors' multisource model.
   Methods: A multisource FEM model was developed to calculate the full
   spatiotemporal temperature distribution due to all heat sources (i.e.,
   individual GNPs and the laser heat source) by solving the heat diffusion
   equation with multiple heat sources using FEM. This model was tested for
   its validity using two computational phantoms, a two-layer GNP-laden
   cylindrical phantom and a breast phantom with a GNP-laden microcavity.
   For comparison, the results for the two phantom cases were also obtained
   from the LS method.
   Results: For the two-layer phantom case, the FEM approach resulted in a
   maximum temperature increase of 16.4 degrees C at a depth of 1.35 cm,
   2.5 mm below the interface between the two layers, while the LS method
   produced a maximum temperature increase of 16.7 degrees C at a depth of
   1.3 cm, 2 mm below the interface between the two layers. A comparison of
   the depth versus temperature changes obtained from the two approaches
   showed reasonably good agreement within 6\%. In the breast phantom case,
   the LS results show a maximum temperature increase of 16.35 degrees C at
   a depth of 2.17 cm, 0.3 mm away from the center of the cavity in the
   direction closer to the laser. The FEM results show the same
   characteristics as those obtained via the LS method with a maximum
   temperature increase of 16.2 degrees C at a depth of 2.16 cm, 0.4 mm
   away from the center of the cavity in the direction closer to the laser.
   The two methods produced good agreement within 2\% for the depth versus
   temperature distributions.
   Conclusions: The current multisource FEM model not only reproduced the
   results from the previous LS model, but also dramatically reduced
   computation time by 2 orders of magnitude, despite a generally more
   stringent requirement for computer memory. With further experimental
   validation, the FEM model can be used to predict the distinct plasmonic
   heating characteristics expected from NIR laser illumination of
   tissue-like media filled with GNPs, while offering the capability of
   handling heterogeneous spatial distribution of GNPs for realistic
   clinical cases. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Electron and x-ray diffraction are well-established experimental methods
   used to explore the atomic scale structure of materials. In this work, a
   computational method is implemented to produce virtual electron and
   x-ray diffraction patterns directly from atomistic simulations without a
   priori knowledge of the unit cell. This method is applied to study the
   structure of {[}0 1 0] symmetric tilt low-angle and large-angle grain
   boundaries in Ni. Virtual electron diffraction patterns and x-ray
   diffraction 2 theta line profiles show that this method can distinguish
   between low-angle grain boundaries with different misorientations and
   between low-angle boundaries with the same misorientation but different
   dislocation configurations. For large-angle Sigma 5 (2 1 0), Sigma 29 (5
   2 0) and Sigma 5 (3 1 0) coincident site lattice {[}0 1 0] symmetric
   tilt grain boundaries, virtual diffraction methods can identify the
   misorientation of the grain boundary and show subtle differences between

Abstract = {{Throughput limitation of wireless networks imposes many practical
   problems as a result of wireless media broadcast nature. The solutions
   of the problem are mainly categorized in two groups; the use of multiple
   orthogonal channels and network coding (NC). The networks with multiple
   orthogonal channels and possibly multiple interfaces can mitigate
   co-channel interference among nodes. However, efficient assignment of
   channels to the available network interfaces is a major problem for
   network designers. Existing heuristic and theoretical work unanimously
   focused on joint design of channel assignment with the conventional
   transport/IP/MAC architecture. Furthermore, NC has been a prominent
   approach to improve the throughput of unicast traffic in wireless
   multi-hop networks through opportunistic NC. In this paper we seek a
   collaboration scheme for NC in multi-channel/interface wireless
   networks, i.e., the integration of NC, routing and channel assignment
   problem. First, we extend the NC for multiple unicast sessions to
   involve both COPE-type and a new proposed scheme named as Star-NC. Then,
   we propose an analytical framework that jointly optimizes the problem of
   routing, channel assignment and NC. Our theoretical formulation via a
   linear programming provides a method for finding source-destination
   routes and utilizing the best choices of different NC schemes to
   maximize the aggregate throughput. Through this LP, we propose a novel
   channel assignment algorithm that is aware of both coding opportunities
   and co-channel interference. Finally, we evaluate our model for various
   networks, traffic models, routing and coding strategies over
   coding-oblivious routing.}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed to study the stress generation in a spherical
   particle subjected to lithium insertion. The model accounts for both the
   plastic deformation and the coexistence of lithium-poor and lithium-rich
   phases with a sharp and curved phase boundary. Such two-phase and
   inelastic deformation characteristics often arise during lithiation of
   crystalline particles with high capacity. A flexible sigmoid function is
   used to create the lithium profile with a step-like change in lithium
   concentration, mimicking a sharp phase boundary that separates a
   pristine core and a lithiated shell in the particle. The mechanics
   results, obtained by an analytic formulation and finite difference
   calculations, show the development of tensile hoop stress in the surface
   layer of the lithiated shell. This hoop tension provides the driving
   force of surface cracking, as observed by in situ transmission electron
   microscopy. The two-phase lithiation model is further compared with the
   single-phase one, which assumes a gradual and smooth variation in radial
   lithium distributions, and thus predicts only hoop compression in the
   surface layer of the particle. Furthermore, the effect of dilatational
   vs. unidirectional lithiation strains in the two-phase model is studied,
   thereby underscoring the critical role of anisotropy of lithiation
   strain in controlling stress generation in high-capacity electrodes for
   lithium ion batteries. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper a micromechanical model that incorporates single crystal
   constitutive relationships is used for studying the pseudoelastic
   response of polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMAs). In the
   micromechanical framework, the stress-free transformation strains of the
   possible martensite twinned structures, correspondence variant pairs
   (CVPs), obtained from the crystallographic data of NiTi are used, and
   the overall transformation strain is obtained by defining a set of
   martensitic volume fractions corresponding to active CVPs during phase
   transformation. The local form of the first law of thermodynamics is
   used and the energy balance relation for the polycrystalline SMAs is
   obtained. Generalized coupled thermomechanical governing equations
   considering the phase transformation latent heat are derived for
   polycrystalline SMAs. A three-dimensional finite element framework is
   used and different polycrystalline samples are modeled based on Voronoi
   tessellations. By considering appropriate distributions of
   crystallographic orientations in the grains obtained from experimental
   texture measurements of NiTi samples, the effects of texture and the
   tension-compression asymmetry in polycrystalline SMAs are studied. The
   interaction between the stress state (tensile or compressive), the
   number of grains and the texture on the mechanical response of
   polycrystalline SMAs is studied. It is found that the number of grains
   (or size) affects both the stress-strain response and the phase
   transformation propagation in the material. In addition to tensile and
   compressive loadings, textured and untextured NiTi micropillars with
   different sizes are also studied in bending. The coupled
   thermomechanical framework is used for analyzing the effect of loading
   rate and the phase transformation latent heat on the response of both
   textured and untextured samples. It is shown that the temperature
   changes due to the heat generation during phase transformation can
   affect the propagation of martensite in samples subjected to high strain
   rates. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nitroglycerin (NG) is a toxic explosive found as a contaminant of soil
   and groundwater. Several microbial strains are capable of partially
   reducing the NG molecule to dinitro or mononitroesters. Recently, a
   strain capable of growing on NG as the sole source of carbon and
   nitrogen (Arthrobacter sp. strain JBH1) was isolated from contaminated
   soil. Despite the widespread presence of microbial strains capable of
   transforming NG in contaminated soils and sediments, the extent of NG
   biodegradation at contaminated sites is still unknown. In this study
   column experiments were conducted to investigate the extent of microbial
   degradation of NG in saturated porous media, specifically after
   bioaugmentation with JBH1. Initial experiments using sterile, low
   sorptivity sand, showed mineralization of NG after bioaugmentation with
   JBH1 in the absence of sources of carbon and nitrogen other than NG.
   Results could be modeled using a first order degradation rate of 0.14
   d(-1). Further experiments conducted using contaminated soil with high
   organic carbon content (highly sorptive) resulted in column effluents
   that did not contain NG although high dinitroester concentrations were
   observed. Bioaugmentation with JBH1 in sediments containing strains
   capable of partial transformation of NG resulted in complete
   mineralization of NG and faster degradation rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A low-noise wideband receiver (Rx) is presented for a multichannel
   wireless implantable neural recording (WINeR) system that utilizes
   time-division multiplexing of pulse width modulated (PWM) samples. The
   WINeR-6 Rx consists of four parts: 1) RF front end; 2) signal
   conditioning; 3) analog output (AO); and 4) field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA) back end. The RF front end receives RF-modulated neural
   signals in the 403-490 MHz band with a wide bandwidth of 18 MHz. The
   frequency-shift keying (FSK) PWM demodulator in the FPGA is a
   time-to-digital converter with 304 ps resolution, which converts the
   analog pulse width information to 16-bit digital samples. Automated
   frequency tracking has been implemented in the Rx to lock onto the
   free-running voltage-controlled oscillator in the transmitter (Tx). Two
   antennas and two parallel RF paths are used to increase the wireless
   coverage area. BCI-2000 graphical user interface has been adopted and
   modified to acquire, visualize, and record the recovered neural signals
   in real time. The AO module picks three demultiplexed channels and
   converts them into analog signals for direct observation on an
   oscilloscope. One of these signals is further amplified to generate an
   audio output, offering users the ability to listen to ongoing neural
   activity. Bench-top testing of the Rx performance with a 32-channel
   WINeR-6 Tx showed that the input referred noise of the entire system at
   a Tx-Rx distance of 1.5 m was 4.58 mu V-rms with 8-bit resolution at 640
   kSps. In an in vivo experiment, location-specific receptive fields of
   hippocampal place cells were mapped during a behavioral experiment in
   which a rat completed 40 laps in a large circular track. Results were
   compared against those acquired from the same animal and the same set of
   electrodes by a commercial hardwired recording system to validate the
   wirelessly recorded signals.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature dependence of the low-frequency noise of 4H-silicon
   carbide (SiC) MOSFETs with nitrided oxides is reported over the
   temperature range 85-510 K. The 1/f noise decreases significantly with
   increasing measurement temperature. This decrease in noise results
   primarily from a decrease in the density of interface traps at
   increasing temperatures. The 1/f noise is also characterized after total
   ionizing dose irradiation and postirradiation annealing. No significant
   change in the 1/f noise is observed after the devices are irradiated to
   1 Mrad (SiO2) and then annealed under bias at elevated temperature.
   These results show that the 1/f noise in 4H-SiC MOSFETs is dominated by
   the interaction of channel carriers with slow interface traps at
   temperatures < 360 K and with border traps > 360 K. This result
   contrasts with most experience with Si/SiO2-based MOSFETs, and results
   from the wider bandgap and greater density of slow interface traps in
   SiC/SiO2-based MOSFETs than in Si/SiO2-based MOSFETs.}},

   is highly sensitive to the trajectory of an intruder aircraft relative
   to the ownship flown by the pilot. In realistic piloted simulations, a
   prescripted intruder trajectory will not reliably result in the relative
   dynamics that lead to a desired TCAS advisory. Further, the complexity
   of the TCAS logic requires a novel method for mapping trajectories to
   the range of possible advisories. We propose to use a rapidly exploring
   random tree algorithm in large-scale fast-time simulations to establish
   the mapping between the space of relative trajectories and TCAS
   advisories. These trajectories are then created in piloted simulations
   through guidance algorithms. Results demonstrate the ease of use and
   robustness of this method, and its potential for pilot training and for
   research and development.}},

Abstract = {{The total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), the current palliation of
   choice for single-ventricle heart defects, is typically created with a
   single cylindrical tunnel or conduit routing inferior vena caval (IVC)
   flow to the pulmonary arteries. Previous studies have shown the
   haemodynamic efficiency of the TCPC to be sub-optimal due to the
   collision of vena caval flow, thus placing an extra energy burden on the
   single ventricle. The use of a bifurcated graft as the Fontan baffle
   (i.e. the `Optiflo') has previously been proposed on the basis of
   theoretically improved flow efficiency; however, anatomical constraints
   may limit its effectiveness in some patients.
   In this study, an alternative approach to flow bifurcation is proposed,
   where a triangular insert is placed at the distal end of the IVC graft.
   The proof of concept for this design is demonstrated in two steps:
   first, determining the optimal insert size at a fixed Fontan graft size
   through a parametric study; then, characterizing the efficiency as a
   function of graft size when compared with a TCPC control. TCPC power
   loss and IVC flow distribution were the primary metrics of interest and
   were evaluated under both resting and simulated exercise conditions
   using an in-house computational fluid dynamics solver.
   Results demonstrated that there was an optimal insert size that improved
   efficiency compared with the TCPC. For an 18-mm Fontan baffle, TCPC
   power loss was 4.1 vs 3.7 mW with the optimal flow-divider. The optimal
   insert was then scaled up for a 20-mm graft, with a similar reduction in
   power loss observed. Flow distribution results were inconsistent, based
   on sensitivity to the placement of the insert within the baffle.
   This study demonstrated proof of concept that the flow-divider has the
   potential to reduce power loss and streamline IVC flow through the TCPC.
   An appropriate size for the insert in proportion to the Fontan baffle
   size was identified that reduced losses compared with a TCPC control
   under both resting and simulated exercise flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rosiglitazone (RSG) is an antidiabetic drug that has been associated
   with increased peripheral fractures, primarily in postmenopausal women.
   In this report, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of
   RSG-associated bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and determined
   whether changes in bone parameters associated with RSG administration
   are reversible on treatment cessation or preventable by coadministration
   with an antiresorptive agent. Nine-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats
   underwent OVX or sham operation. Sham-operated rats received oral
   vehicle only; OVX animals were randomized to receive vehicle, RSG,
   alendronate (ALN), or RSG plus ALN for 12 weeks. All treatment started
   the day after ovariectomy. After the 12-week treatment period, the OVX
   and RSG groups also underwent an 8-week treatment-free recovery period.
   Bone densitometry measurements, bone turnover markers, biomechanical
   testing, and histomorphometric analysis were conducted. Microcomputed
   tomography was also used to investigate changes in microarchitecture.
   RSG significantly increased deoxypyridinoline levels compared with OVX.
   Significant exacerbation of OVX-induced loss of bone mass, strength, and
   microarchitectural deterioration was observed in RSG-treated OVX animals
   compared with OVX controls. These effects were observed predominantly at
   sites rich in trabecular bone, with less pronounced effects in cortical
   bone. Coadministration of RSG and ALN prevented the bone loss associated
   with RSG treatment. Following cessation of RSG treatment, effects on
   bone mass and strength showed evidence of reversal. Thus, treatment of
   OVX rats with RSG results in loss of bone mass and strength, primarily
   at sites rich in trabecular bone, mainly due to increased bone
   resorption. These effects can be prevented by concomitant treatment with
   ALN and may be reversed following discontinuation of RSG.}},

Abstract = {{The free vibration response of a unidirectional sandwich panel with a
   compressible and incompressible core using the various computational
   models is presented and compared with closed-form elasticity solutions
   and finite element results. The mathematical formulations for various
   models along with the numerical investigation are presented in two
   parts. In the first part compressible core are considered using the
   elasticity closed-form solution and various high-order computational
   models such as the high-order sandwich panel theory (HSAPT) and the
   extended HSAPT model (EHSAPT). The second part is dedicated to
   incompressible cores and includes classical models, first-order and
   high-order shear deformable models, and zig-zag displacement pattern
   model, ordinary sandwich panel theory. The elasticity-based model
   serving as the benchmark solution (in first part) assumes isotropic,
   orthotropic, as well as layered core types. The mathematical formulation
   utilizes Hamilton's principle to derive the general equations of motion.
   A closed-form solution of the elasticity model is available only for a
   simply-supported panel and it is compared with all various models
   numerically. The numerical investigation includes: eigenfrequencies,
   displacement modes along the length and through the depth of panel, as
   well as stress modes through the depth of panel. The results of the
   various models are compared with the 2D elasticity solution and finite
   element results of ADINA. In general, the lower mode correlates well for
   all models while for the higher modes only the EHSAPT and the HSAPT with
   displacement formulation compared well.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant microelectronic interconnects are potential replacements for
   solder balls which accommodate this differential displacement by
   mechanically decoupling the die from the substrate or the substrate from
   the board and aim to improve overall reliability and life of the
   microelectronic system. Multi-path, fan-shaped compliant interconnect is
   being pursued at Georgia Tech as an alternate die-to-substrate or
   substrate-to-board interconnect. This multi-path fan-shaped interconnect
   has arcuate structures as well as vertical posts to provide in-plane and
   out-of-plane compliance, respectively. In this paper, we present the
   compliance values for the proposed interconnects using analytical
   formulations and finite-element simulations and compare these values
   using experimental data. The analytical formulations can be used for
   optimization of the geometry, because we can know the contribution of
   the parameters to the compliant values from the potential energy terms.
   Finite-element simulations can take elastic-plastic into consideration,
   while the analytical formulation cannot. They also help to validate our
   results because they were developed independently. It is seen that the
   scaled-up polymer interconnects will have a compliance of 0.1-0.15 mm/N
   in the out-of-plane direction and 0.05-0.15 mm/N in the in-plane
   directions. Also, it is seen that the results from finite-element
   simulations using 3D solid elements as well as beam elements agree
   against each other, and also against analytical models and experimental
   measurements. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (Pdia3) mediates many of
   the plasma membrane (PM)-associated rapid responses to 1
   alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1 alpha,25{[}OH](2)D-3). It is not well
   understood how Pdia3, which is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone,
   functions as a PM receptor for 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. We mutated 3 amino
   acids (K214 and R282 in the calreticulin interaction site and C406 in
   the isomerase catalytic site), which are important for Pdia3's ER
   chaperone function, and examined their role in responses to 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. Pdia3 constructs with and without the ER retention
   signal KDEL were used to investigate the PM requirement for Pdia3.
   Finally, we determined whether palmitoylation and/or myristoylation were
   required for Pdia3-mediated responses to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3.
   Overexpressing the Pdia3 R282A mutant in MC3T3-E1 cells increased PM
   phospholipase A2-activating protein, Rous sarcoma oncogene (c-Src), and
   caveolin-1 but blocked increases in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated
   protein kinase C (PKC) seen in cells overexpressing wild-type Pdia3
   (Pdia3(Ovr) cells). Cells overexpressing Pdia3 with K214A and C406S
   mutations had PKC activity comparable to untreated controls, indicating
   that the native response to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 also was blocked.
   Overexpressing Pdia3({[}-KDEL]) increased PM localization and augmented
   baseline PKC, but the stimulatory effect of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 was
   comparable to that seen in wild-type cultures. In contrast, 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 increased prostaglandin E2 in Pdia3({[}+/- KDEL])
   cells. Although neither palmitoylation nor myristoylation was required
   for PM association of Pdia3, myristoylation was needed for PKC
   activation. These data indicate that both the chaperone functional
   domains and the subcellular location of Pdia3 control rapid membrane
   responses to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3.}},

Abstract = {{III-nitride (III-N) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) are a
   less-explored electronic device technology due to the myriad research
   issues in material growth, device design and fabrication associated with
   these devices. For III-N HBTs, npn-GaN/InGaN heterostructures provide
   the benefits of mitigating the poor base electrical conductivity of
   p-type GaN and the problematic magnesium incorporation issues.
   Consequently, InGaN-base III-N HBTs are promising for next-generation
   high-power RF III-N systems. This paper will describe the current
   development status of npn GaN/InGaN HBTs grown either on sapphire or
   free-standing (FS) GaN substrates using optimized metalorganic chemical
   vapor deposition (MOCVD) and refined HBT processing techniques.
   Recombination current paths in GaN/InGaN HBTs are studied and
   small-signal equivalent circuits are developed. The extracted device
   model indicates that, with further device fabrication technique
   development, Johnson's figure of merit (JFOM) of GaN/InGaN HBTs can be
   as high as 5 THz V.}},

Abstract = {{Fluids are involved in practically all physiological activities of
   living organisms. However, biological and biorelated flows are hard to

   Recent advances in mesoscale simulations enable researchers to tackle
   problems that are central for the understanding of such flows.
   Furthermore, computational modeling effectively facilitates the
   development of novel therapeutic approaches. Among other methods,
   dissipative particle dynamics and the lattice Boltzmann method have
   become increasingly popular during recent years due to their ability to

Abstract = {{Engine-related improvements such as more efficient engine components,
   improved engine oils, and high-performance coating materials, need to be

   system during steady-state operation by considering the effects of
   temperature, load, oil degradation, surface roughness, and material
   properties. The model can be used either in theoretical modeling or
   integrated with finite element analysis. Based on a laboratory
   simulator, a three-body abrasive wear model has been developed to model
   the wear progression of the piston ring/cylinder bore system during
   steady state operation. The proposed novel abrasive wear model addresses
   the effects of temperature, lucid, oil degradation, surface roughness,

Abstract = {{This article introduces the use of a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
   instrument as a non-destructive tool to rapidly determine fluorochemical
   concentration on carpet fibers. Most portable XRF instruments are not
   capable of detecting the primary element in fluorochemicals, fluorine
   (F) directly. However, fluorochemicals may be combined with chemical
   taggants, which are measurable. When properly calibrated, the taggant
   concentrations are a proxy for the F level on carpet fibers, which in
   turn represents fluorochemical concentration. Results in this research
   showed that an accuracy of 150 +/- 50ppm of F can be achieved using a
   portable XRF instrument. This level and accuracy range is specified by
   manufacturers as an acceptable fluorochemical concentration on carpet
   fibers. Therefore, a portable XRF instrument can be used in place of the
   certified chemical burn test, thereby reducing the response time to
   obtain test results from hours for the chemical burn test to less than
   5min when using the portable XRF technology. This online measurement
   system for fluorochemical concentration can also be used as a practical
   means of determining fluorochemical distribution profiles across carpet
   samples. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We examined facial electromyography (fEMG) activity to dynamic,
   audio-visual emotional displays in individuals with autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) individuals. Participants
   viewed clips of happy, angry, and fearful displays that contained both
   facial expression and affective prosody while surface electrodes
   measured corrugator supercilli and zygomaticus major facial muscle
   activity. Across measures of average and peak activity, the TD group
   demonstrated emotion-selective fEMG responding, with greater relative
   activation of the zygomatic to happy stimuli and greater relative
   activation of the corrugator to fearful stimuli. In contrast, the ASD
   group largely showed no significant differences between zygomatic and
   corrugator activity across these emotions. There were no group
   differences in the magnitude and timing of fEMG response in the muscle
   congruent to the stimuli. This evidence that fEMG responses in ASD are
   undifferentiated with respect to the valence of the stimulus is
   discussed in light of potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms.}},

   screen-printed low-to-medium concentrator Si cells and validates it by
   fabricating some of the highest efficiency metal paste printed cells

   efficiency at any given concentration is a function of metal paste,
   contact parameters, number of fingers, and finger length due to the
   tradeoff between resistive and shadow losses. Consistent with the model
   calculations, first, 52 mm x 27 mm similar to 19\% cells were fabricated
   at similar to 5X (suns) with a Dupont 16 A paste and similar to 110 mu m
   wide 32 lines. Then, with improved 50 mu m wide direct extrusion printed
   fingers, >20\% efficient cells were achieved in the concentration range
   of 3-16X, along with a roadmap to similar to 21\% efficient cells. This
   approach provides excellent guidelines to design grid pattern and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{196-211}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We compare thermally and seismically induced sliding mechanisms of
   blocks that are separated from the rock mass by a tension crack and
   slide along a frictional interface. The rock slopes of Masada Mountain,
   Israel, are used to demonstrate our approach. Crack displacement coupled
   with thermal fluctuations is measured in the West slope of the mountain
   during two years (2009-11). Physical and mechanical lab tests provide
   the assumed depth of penetration of the heating front during seasonal
   cycles of exposure as well as the thermal expansion coefficient of the
   rock mass. These, along with the shear stiffness of the sliding
   interface, allow us to quantify the expected thermally induced
   displacement rate of blocks in Masada, through a proposed
   wedging-ratcheting failure mechanism. A distinct block in the East slope
   of the mountain exhibiting a tension crack opening of 200 mm was
   monitored for displacement and temperature during a single seasonal
   cycle in 1998. Based on the assumed seismicity of the region and the
   known topographic site effect, along with the laboratory measured
   frictional resistance and shear stiffness of the sliding interface, we
   subject the mapped geometry of the block in the East face to simulated
   cycles of earthquake vibrations utilizing the numerical, discrete
   element, discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) method. We find that
   for a time window of 5000 years, the observed 200 mm displacement of the
   East slope block is more likely to have been thermally, rather than
   seismically, controlled. This result implies that in climatic regions
   where the temperature amplitude over a seasonal cycle is sufficiently
   high, thermally induced displacements play an important role in rock
   slope erosion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aortic valve (AV) experiences a complex mechanical environment,
   which includes tension, flexure, pressure, and shear stress forces due
   to blood flow during each cardiac cycle. This mechanical environment
   regulates AV tissue structure by constantly renewing and remodeling the
   phenotype. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies have shown that
   pathological states such as hypertension and congenital defect like
   bicuspid AV (BAV) can potentially alter the AV's mechanical environment,
   triggering a cascade of remodeling, inflammation, and calcification
   activities in AV tissue. Alteration in mechanical environment is first
   sensed by the endothelium, which in turn induces changes in the
   extracellular matrix, and triggers cell differentiation and activation.
   However, the molecular mechanism of this process is not understood very
   well. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for advancing the
   development of effective medical based therapies. Recently, there have
   been some interesting studies on characterizing the hemodynamics
   associated with AV, especially in pathologies like BAV, using different
   experimental and numerical methods. Here, we review the current
   knowledge of the local AV mechanical environment and its effect on valve
   biology, focusing on in vitro and ex vivo approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Arteries manifest a remodeling response to long-term alterations in
   arterial pressure and blood flow by changing geometry, structure, and
   composition through processes driven by perturbations of the local
   stresses in the vascular wall from their baseline values. The objective
   of this study is twofold-to develop a general method for calculating the
   remodeling responses of an artery considered as a two-layered tube; and
   to provide results for adaptive and maladaptive remodeling of a coronary
   artery. By formulating an inverse problem of vascular mechanics, the
   geometrical dimensions and mechanical properties of an artery are
   calculated from a prescribed deformed configuration, stress field,
   structural stiffness, and applied load. As an illustrative example we
   consider a human LAD coronary artery in both a perfect and incomplete
   adaptive response to a sustained step-wise change in pressure and a
   maladaptive response due to impaired remodeling of adventitia. The
   results obtained show that adventitia plays an important role in
   vascular mechanics when an artery is subjected to high arterial
   pressure. In addition to its well-known short term function of
   preventing over-inflation of an artery, it seems reasonable to accept
   that the manner by which adventitia remodels in response to a chronic
   increase in pressure is essential for preserving normal arterial
   function or may lead to an increased risk of developing vascular
   disorders.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{For wireless mobile multihop relay (MMR) networks, we have chosen
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and time division
   duplex as a multiple access scheme and a duplex communication technique,
   respectively. We have also selected nontransparent relay stations
   (nt-RSs) as relay nodes to extend the MMR network coverage. Through the
   nt-RSs, far-off subscriber stations (SSs) or hidden SSs can communicate
   with a base station (BS) that is connected to backhaul networks. In
   these MMR networks, the way in which a BS and nt-RSs use OFDMA resources
   (e.g., OFDMA symbols and subcarriers) and share them might reduce system
   capacity and network throughput. Therefore, we proposed a new adaptive
   OFDMA frame structure for both the BS and the nt-RSs. The proposed
   scheme is the first approach that incorporates the adaptive technique
   for wireless MMR networks. Based on the proposed adaptive OFDMA frame
   structure, an adaptive OFDMA resource allocation for SSs within a BS as
   well as nt-RSs was proposed. To derive the maximum OFDMA resource that
   nt-RSs can be assigned and to synchronize access zones and relay zones
   between a superior station and its subordinate nt-RSs, three properties
   are introduced: a data relay property, a maximum balance property, and a
   relay zone limitation property. In addition, we propose max-min and
   proportional fairness schemes of the proposed adaptive frame structure.
   Our numerical analysis and simulations show that the proposed OFDMA
   allocation scheme performs better than the nonadaptive allocation scheme
   in terms of network throughput and fairness especially in the asymmetric
   distribution of subscriber stations between access zones and relay zones
   in the MMR networks. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the use of in vivo imaging of rabbit model of
   choroidal melanoma using high-frequency contrast-enhanced ultrasound
   (HF-CE-US) with two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) modes and
   to correlate the sonographic findings with histopathologic
   characteristics.
   Methods Five New Zealand white rabbits, which were immunosuppressed with
   daily cyclosporin A (CsA), were inoculated into their right eyes with
   aliquots of 1.5x10(6)/50 mu l of 92.1 human uveal melanoma cells
   cultured in RPMI. At week 4, the tumour-bearing eyes were imaged using
   high-frequency ultrasound (HF-US) with microbubble contrast agent to
   determine the 2D tumour size and relative blood volume and by 3D mode to
   determine tumour volume. Histologic tumour burden was quantified in
   enucleated eyes by ImageJ software, and mean vascular density (MVD) was
   determined by counting vascular channels in periodic acid Schiff (PAS)
   without haematoxylin sections.
   Results Using HF-CE-US, melanomas were visualised as relatively
   hyperechoic regions in the images. The correlation coefficients of
   sonographic size and volume compared with histologic area were 0.72 and
   0.70, respectively. The sonographic tumour relative blood volume
   correlated with the histologic tumour vascularity (r(2)=0.92, p=0.04).
   Conclusions There is a positive correlation between in vivo sonographic
   tumour volume/size and histologic tumour size in our rabbit choroidal
   melanoma model. HF-CE-US corresponds to MVD and blood volume.}},

Abstract = {{The thermomechanical response of HMX/Estane, a polymer-bonded explosive

   main objective of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of the

   they undergo mechanical and thermal processes subsequent to impact. A
   recently developed cohesive finite element method (CFEM) framework is
   used to study the microstructure-level response of PBX. The CFEM
   framework allows the contributions of individual constituents, fracture
   and frictional contact along failed crack surfaces to heating to be
   tracked and analyzed. Digitized micrographs of actual PBX materials are
   used. The issues studied include large deformation, thermomechanical
   coupling, failure in the forms of microcracks in both bulk constituents
   and along grain/matrix interfaces, and frictional heating. The focus is
   on the correlation between grain-level failure mechanisms and overall
   temperature rise in the PBX. The results are used to establish
   microstructure-response relations that can be used in the design of

Abstract = {{Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have paved a road for Secondary Users
   (SUs) to opportunistically exploit unused spectrum without harming the
   communications among Primary Users (PUs). In this paper, practical
   unicast and convergecast schemes, which are overlooked by most of the
   existing works for CRNs, are proposed. We first construct a cell-based
   virtual backbone for CRNs. Then prove that SUs have positive
   probabilities to access the spectrum and the expected one hop delay is
   bounded by a constant, if the density of PUs is finite. According to
   this fact, we proposed a three-step unicast scheme and a two-phase
   convergecast scheme. We demonstrate that the induced delay from our
   proposed Unicast Scheduling (US) algorithm scales linearly with the
   transmission distance between the source and the destination.
   Furthermore, the expected delay of the proposed Convergecast Scheduling
   (CS) algorithm is proven to be upper bounded by . To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first study of convergecast in CRNs. Finally, the
   performance of the proposed algorithms is validated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Potholes, as a severe type of pavement distress, are currently
   identified and assessed manually in pavement-maintenance programs. This
   manual process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing methods
   for automated pothole detection either rely on expensive and
   high-maintenance range sensors or make use of acceleration data, which
   only apply when the pothole is on the tires' path. The authors' previous
   work has proposed and validated a camera-based pothole-detection method.
   However, this method is limited to single frames and cannot determine
   the severity of potholes. This paper presents a novel method that
   addresses these issues by incrementally updating a representative
   texture template for intact pavement regions and using a vision tracker
   to reduce the computational effort, improve the detection reliability,
   and count potholes efficiently. The improved method was implemented and
   tested on real data. The results indicate a significant capability and
   performance increase of this method over its predecessor.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{726}},
Pages = {{261-284}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{By studying the dynamics of the streamwise pressure gradient at the
   wavefront of travelling interfacial waves, we investigate the formation
   and evolution of backflow regions for the sinusoidal and teardrop-shaped
   surface wave regimes of laminar falling liquid films. The magnitude of
   the wavefront streamwise pressure gradient grows as the flow inlet
   disturbance increases in amplitude and steepness. At large enough
   values, the adverse pressure gradient induces flow separation and
   subsequently backflow at the large-amplitude wavefront. The backflow
   region evolves from a closed circulation to an open vortex as the wave
   grows to saturation. The dynamics of the streamwise pressure gradient at
   the sinusoidal wavefront approaches a stable fixed point at saturation.
   Thus, the open vortex retains its structure as the wave continues
   downstream. The streamwise pressure gradient at the wavefront of the
   teardrop-shaped pulse evolves similarly to a time-periodic function with
   multiple minima/maxima. This phenomenon is a consequence of the
   interaction between the teardrop-shaped wave and newly formed preceding
   capillary waves. The nature of the teardrop pulse-capillary wave
   interaction is such that a decrease in magnitude of the streamwise
   pressure gradient at the teardrop-shaped wavefront is followed by an
   increase at the capillary wavefront and vice versa. The increased
   adverse pressure gradient at the capillary wavefront induces a second
   open vortex backflow, while the teardrop-shaped wavefront's open vortex
   reverts to a closed circulation. This interaction between the waves
   continues as the teardrop pulse-capillary wavetrain travels downstream,
   leading to multiple capillary waves and backflow regions.}},

Title = {{Monitoring and evaluation of self-healing in concrete using diffuse
   ultrasound}},
Journal = {{NDT \& E INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{36-44}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The progression of self-healing of cracked concrete is monitored in situ
   by diffuse ultrasound, in a novel application of this technique. The
   diffuse ultrasonic measurements are conducted on uncracked, tensile
   through-thickness cracked, and flexure partial-thickness cracked
   concrete specimens. Specimens made from three different mix designs are
   unbonded post-tensioned with a precompression force of 6.2 MPa that
   allows for the generation of cracks with widths less than 200 pm that
   should exhibit self-healing and are then exposed to a simulated marine
   environment. To estimate the extent of crack healing over time, two
   diffuse ultrasonic parameters are measured: an effective diffusivity and
   an arrival time of maximum energy (ATME). In addition, microscopic
   measurements of crack width on the specimen surface are taken over a 4
   month exposure time period. Initial cracking causes an increase in the
   ATME and a significant decrease in diffusivity as compared to those of
   the reference, uncracked control specimens. With the progress of
   self-healing, the ATME of both tensile and flexure cracked specimens
   decreases, while the diffusivity increases and recovers the initial
   values found in the uncracked control specimens. These changes in the
   ATME and diffusivity suggest autogenous healing of the cracks.
   Comparisons of experimental results for these two parameters show that
   the diffusivity predicts self-healing trends in a more effective way
   than the ATME. A simple model is used to evaluate healing rates in
   different concrete mixes. The healing rates determined for the three mix
   designs are consistent with the results of independent observations.
   Finally, it is concluded that the present diffuse ultrasonic method is
   capable of monitoring and evaluating the self-healing of concrete. (C)

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are known to interact
   electrostatically with positively charged growth factors to modulate
   signaling. Therefore, regulating the degree of sulfation of GAGs may be
   a promising approach to tailor biomaterial carriers for controlled
   growth factor delivery and release. For this study, chondroitin sulfate
   (CS) was first desulfated to form chondroitin, and resulting crosslinked
   CS and chondroitin hydrogels were examined in vitro for release of
   positively charged model protein (histone) and for their effect on
   cartilaginous differentiation of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs). Desulfation significantly increased the release of histone
   from chondroitin hydrogels (30.6 +/- 23 mu g released over 8 days,
   compared to natively sulfated CS with 20.2 +/- 0.8 mu g), suggesting
   that sulfation alone plays a significant role in modulating protein
   interactions with GAG hydrogels. MSCs in chondroitin hydrogels
   significantly upregulated gene expression of collagen II and aggrecan by
   day 21 in chondrogenic medium (115 +/- 100 and 23.1 +/- 7.9 fold
   upregulation of collagen II and aggrecan, respectively), compared to CS
   hydrogels and PEG-based swelling controls, indicating that desulfation
   may actually enhance the response of MSCs to soluble chondrogenic cues,
   such as TGF-beta 1. Thus, desulfated chondroitin materials present a
   promising biomaterial tool to further investigate electrostatic
   GAG/growth factor interactions, especially for repair of cartilaginous
   tissues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelial outgrowth cells (EOCs) have garnered much attention as a
   potential autologous endothelial source for vascular implants or in
   tissue engineering applications due to their ease of isolation and
   proliferative ability; however, how these cells respond to different
   hemodynamic cues is ill-defined. This study investigates the
   inflammatory and thrombotic response of baboon EOCs (BaEOCs) to four
   hemodynamic conditions using the cone and plate shear apparatus: steady,
   laminar shear stress (SS); pulsatile, nonreversing laminar shear stress
   (PS); oscillatory, laminar shear stress (OS); and net positive,
   pulsatile, reversing laminar shear stress (RS). In summary, endothelial
   nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA was significantly upregulated by SS
   compared to OS. No differences were found in the mRNA levels of the
   inflammatory markers intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),
   E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) between the
   shear conditions; however, OS significantly increased the number of
   monocytes bound when compared to SS. Next, SS increased the
   anti-thrombogenic mRNA levels of CD39, thrombomodulin, and endothelial
   protein-C receptor (EPCR) compared to OS. SS also significantly
   increased CD39 and EPCR mRNA levels compared to RS. Finally, no
   significant differences were detected when comparing pro-thrombotic
   tissue factor mRNA or its activity levels. These results indicate that
   shear stress can have beneficial (SS) or adverse (OS, RS) effects on the
   inflammatory or thrombotic potential of EOCs. Further, these results
   suggest SS hemodynamic preconditioning may be optimal in increasing the
   efficacy of a vascular implant or in tissue-engineered applications that
   have incorporated EOCs.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial enzymes have been used in a large number of fields, such as
   chemical, agricultural and biopharmaceutical industries. The enzyme
   production rate and yield are the main factors to consider when choosing
   the appropriate expression system for the production of recombinant
   proteins. Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in bacteria (e. g.,
   Escherichia coli, Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria), filamentous fungi
   (e. g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e. g., Pichia pastoris). The favorable
   and very advantageous characteristics of these species have resulted in
   an increasing number of biotechnological applications. Bacterial hosts
   (e. g., E. coli) can be used to quickly and easily overexpress
   recombinant enzymes; however, bacterial systems cannot express very
   large proteins and proteins that require post-translational
   modifications. The main bacterial expression hosts, with the exception
   of lactic acid bacteria and filamentous fungi, can produce several
   toxins which are not compatible with the expression of recombinant
   enzymes in food and drugs. However, due to the multiplicity of the
   physiological impacts arising from high-level expression of genes
   encoding the enzymes and expression hosts, the goal of overproduction
   can hardly be achieved, and therefore, the yield of recombinant enzymes
   is limited. In this review, the recent strategies used for the
   high-level expression of microbial enzymes in the hosts mentioned above
   are summarized and the prospects are also discussed. We hope this review
   will contribute to the development of the enzyme-related research field.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the diffuse reflection diameter and diffuse
   reflection radius problems for convex-quadrilateralizable polygons. In
   the usual model of diffuse reflection, a light ray incident at a point
   on the reflecting surface is reflected from that point in all possible
   inward directions. A ray reflected from a polygonal edge may graze that
   reflecting edge but an incident ray cannot graze the reflecting edge.
   The diffuse reflection diameter of a simple polygon P is the minimum
   number of diffuse reflections that may be needed in the worst case to
   illuminate any target point t from any point light source s inside P. We
   show that the diameter is upper bounded by 3n=10/4 in our usual model of
   diffuse reflection for convex-quadrilateralizable polygons. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first upper bound on diffuse reflection
   diameter within a fraction of n for such a class of polygons. We also
   show that the diffuse reflection radius of a convex-quadrilateralizable
   simple polygon with n vertices is at most 3n-10/8 under the usual model
   of diffuse reflection. In other words, there exists a point inside such
   a polygon from which 3n-10/8 usual diffuse reflections are always
   sufficient to illuminate the entire polygon. In order to establish these
   bounds for the usual model, we first show that the diameter and radius
   are n-4/2 and left perpendicularn-4/4right perpendicular respectively,

Abstract = {{Recombinant, elastin-like protein (ELP) polymers are of significant
   interest for the engineering of compliant, resilient soft tissues due to
   a wide range of tunable mechanical properties, biostability, and
   biocompatibility. Here, we enhance endothelial cell (EC) and mesenchymal
   stem cell compatibility with ELP constructs by addition of fibronectin
   (Fn) to the surface or bulk of ELP hydrogels. We find that cell
   adhesion, proliferation, and migration can be modulated by Fn addition.
   Adsorption of Fn to the hydrogel surface is more efficient than bulk
   blending. Surface immobilization of Fn by genipin crosslinking leads to
   stability without loss of bioactivity. Gels of varying mechanical
   modulus do not alter cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in the
   range we investigate. However, more compliant gels promote an EC
   morphology suggesting tubulogenesis or network formation, whereas
   stiffer gels promote cobblestone morphology. Multilayer structures
   consisting of thin ELP sheets reinforced with collagen microfiber are
   fabricated and laminated through the culture of MSCs at layer
   interfaces. High cell viability in the resulting three-dimensional
   constructs suggests the applicability of Fn to the design of strong,
   resilient artificial blood vessels and other soft tissue replacements.

Abstract = {{Compatibility equations of elasticity are almost 150 years old.
   Interestingly, they do not seem to have been rigorously studied, to
   date, for non-simply-connected bodies. In this paper we derive necessary
   and sufficient compatibility equations of nonlinear elasticity for
   arbitrary non-simply-connected bodies when the ambient space is
   Euclidean. For a non-simply-connected body, a measure of strain may not
   be compatible, even if the standard compatibility equations
   ({''}bulk{''} compatibility equations) are satisfied. It turns out that
   there may be topological obstructions to compatibility; this paper aims
   to understand them for both deformation gradient F and the right
   Cauchy-Green strain C = F (T) F. We show that the necessary and
   sufficient conditions for compatibility of deformation gradient F are
   the vanishing of its exterior derivative and all its periods, that is,
   its integral over generators of the first homology group of the material
   manifold. We will show that not every non-null-homotopic path requires
   supplementary compatibility equations for F and linearized strain e. We
   then find both necessary and sufficient compatibility conditions for the
   right Cauchy-Green strain tensor C for arbitrary non-simply-connected
   bodies when the material and ambient space manifolds have the same
   dimensions. We discuss the well-known necessary compatibility equations
   in the linearized setting and the CesA ro-Volterra path integral. We
   then obtain the sufficient conditions of compatibility for the
   linearized strain when the body is not simply-connected. To summarize,
   the question of compatibility reduces to two issues: i) an integrability
   condition, which is d(F dX) = 0 for the deformation gradient and a
   curvature vanishing condition for C, and ii) a topological condition.
   For F dx this is a homological condition because the equation one is
   trying to solve takes the form d phi = F dX. For C, however, parallel
   transport is involved, which means that one needs to solve an equation
   of the form dR/ ds = RK, where R takes values in the orthogonal group.
   This is, therefore, a question about an orthogonal representation of the
   fundamental group, which, as the orthogonal group is not commutative,
   cannot, in general, be reduced to a homological question.}},

Pages = {{95-105}},

Abstract = {{An approach was developed to predict the thermo-mechanical fatigue crack
   growth rates under typical gas turbine engine spectrum loading
   conditions. The material studied in the development of this model was a
   polycrystalline superalloy, Inconel 100. Load interaction effects were
   determined to have a major effect on the crack growth life. A yield zone
   load interaction life prediction model was modified to include
   temperature dependent properties. Multiple overload effects were
   included in the model to incorporate enhanced retardation compared to
   single overload retardation behavior. Temperature interaction effects
   were included and proved to be very important because of the wide
   temperature ranges to which turbine engine components are subjected. The
   effects of oxidation and temperature changes were accounted for in the
   model by accelerating crack growth in regions that had been previously
   affected by elevated temperatures. Experimental data of isolated, first
   order effects were used to calibrate and verify the model. Temperature
   dependent mechanical properties were determined and were essential in
   the model's development. Parametric studies were performed using this
   model to assess the sensitivity of specific crack growth variables on
   life predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By engineering the fiber/matrix interface, the properties of the

   effective surface area of the fiber/matrix interface, to facilitate
   additional stress transfer between fibers and matrix, by grafting carbon
   nanotubes on to carbon fibers (in the form of carbon fabric) by two
   different methods: (1) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and (2) a
   purely chemical method. With the CVD process, carbon nanotubes (CNT)
   were directly grown on carbon fiber substrate using chemical vapors. For
   the chemical method, CNT with carboxyl groups were grafted on
   functionalized carbon fiber via a chemical reaction. The morphology of
   CNT/carbon fibers was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   which revealed uniform coverage of carbon fibers with CNT in both of CVD
   method and chemical grafting method. CNT-grafted woven carbon fibers
   were used to make carbon/epoxy composites, and their mechanical
   properties were measured using three-point bending and tension tests
   which showed that those with CNT-grafted carbon fiber reinforcements
   using the CVD process has 11 \% higher tensile strength compared to
   those containing carbon fibers modified with the chemical method. Also,
   composites with CNT-grafted carbon fibers with chemical method showed 20
   \% higher tensile strength compared to composites with unmodified carbon
   fibers. The results of tensile test revealed that both CVD and chemical
   grafting could significantly improve the mechanical properties of the

Title = {{The impact of chronic blood-brain barrier breach on intracortical

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have allowed control of prosthetic
   limbs in paralyzed patients. Unfortunately, the electrodes of the BCI
   that interface with the brain only function for a short period of time
   before the signal quality on these electrodes becomes substantially
   diminished. To truly realize the potential of BCIs, it is imperative to
   have electrodes that function chronically. In order to elucidate the
   physiological determinants of a chronically functional neural interface,
   we studied the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in electrode
   function, because it is a key mediator of neuronal hemostasis. We
   monitored the status of the BBB and the consequences of BBB breach on
   electrode function using noninvasive imaging, electrophysiology,
   genomic, and histological analyses. Rats implanted with commercially
   available intracortical electrodes demonstrated an inverse correlation
   between electrode performance and BBB breach over a period of 16 weeks.
   Genomic analysis showed that chronically functional electrodes elicit an
   enhanced wound healing response. Conversely, in poorly functioning
   electrodes, chronic BBB breach led to local accumulation of neurotoxic
   factors and an influx of pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, which
   negatively affect neuronal health. These findings were further verified
   in a subset of electrodes with graded electrophysiological performance.
   In this study, we determine the mechanistic link between intracortical
   electrode function and failure. Our results indicate that BBB status is
   a critical physiological determinant of intracortical electrode function
   and can inform future electrode design and biochemical intervention
   strategies to enhance the functional longevity of BCIs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The theoretical relationship between the prediction variance of a
   Gaussian process model (GPM) and its mean square prediction error is
   well known. This relationship has been studied for the case when
   deterministic simulations are used in GPM, with application to design of
   computer experiments and metamodeling optimization. This article
   analyzes the error estimation of Gaussian process models when the
   simulated data observations contain measurement noise. In particular,
   this work focuses on the correlation between the GPM prediction variance
   and the distribution of prediction errors over multiple experimental
   designs, as a function of location in the input space. The results show
   that the error estimation properties of a Gaussian process model using
   stochastic simulations are preserved when the signal-to-noise ratio in
   the data is larger than 10, regardless of the number of training points
   used in the metamodel. Also, this article concludes that the
   distribution of prediction errors approaches a normal distribution with
   a variance equal to the GPM prediction variance, even in the presence of
   significant bias in the GPM predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Infraslow LFP correlates to resting-state fMRI BOLD signals}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{288-297}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The slow fluctuations of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD)
   signal in resting-state fMRI are widely utilized as a surrogate marker
   of ongoing neural activity. Spontaneous neural activity includes a broad
   range of frequencies, from infraslow (<0.5 Hz) fluctuations to fast
   action potentials. Recent studies have demonstrated a correlative
   relationship between the BOLD fluctuations and power modulations of the
   local field potential (LFP), particularly in the gamma band. However,
   the relationship between the BOLD signal and the infraslow components of
   the LFP, which are directly comparable in frequency to the BOLD
   fluctuations, has not been directly investigated. Here we report a first
   examination of the temporal relation between the resting-state BOLD
   signal and infraslow LFPs using simultaneous fMRI and full-band LFP
   recording in rat. The spontaneous BOLD signal at the recording sites
   exhibited significant localized correlation with the infraslow LFP
   signals as well as with the slow power modulations of higher-frequency
   LFPs (1-100 Hz) at a delay comparable to the hemodynamic response time
   under anesthesia. Infraslow electrical activity has been postulated to
   play a role in attentional processes, and the findings reported here
   suggest that infraslow LFP coordination may share a mechanism with the
   large-scale BOLD-based networks previously implicated in task
   performance, providing new insight into the mechanisms contributing to
   the resting state fMRI signal. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Uncertainties associated with meteorological inputs which are propagated
   through atmospheric chemical transport models may constrain their
   ability to replicate the effects of wildland fires on air quality. Here,
   we investigate the sensitivity of predicted fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) levels to uncertain wind fields by simulating the air quality
   impacts of two fires on an urban area with the Community Multiscale Air
   Quality modeling system (CMAQ). Brute-force sensitivity analyses show
   that modeled concentrations at receptors downwind from the fires are
   highly sensitive to variations in wind speed and direction.
   Additionally, uncertainty in wind fields produced with the Weather
   Research and Forecasting model was assessed by evaluating meteorological
   predictions against surface and upper air observations. Significant
   differences between predicted and observed wind fields were identified.
   Simulated PM2.5 concentrations at urban sites displayed large
   sensitivities to wind perturbations within the error range of
   meteorological inputs. The analyses demonstrate that normalized errors
   in CMAQ predictions attempting to model the regional impacts of fires on
   PM2.5 levels could be as high as 100\% due to inaccuracies in wind data.
   Meteorological drivers may largely account for the considerable
   discrepancies between monitoring site observations and predicted
   concentrations. The results of this study demonstrate that limitations
   in fire-related air quality simulations cannot be overcome by solely
   improving emission rates.}},

Abstract = {{A series of aminopropyl-functionalized silicas containing of primary,
   secondary, or tertiary amines is fabricated via silane-grafting on
   mesoporous SBA-15 silica and the utility of each material in the
   adsorption of volatile aldehydes from air is systematically assessed. A
   particular emphasis is placed on low-molecular-weight aldehydes such as
   formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are highly problematic volatile
   organic compound (VOC) pollutants. The adsorption tests demonstrate that
   the aminosilica materials with primary amines most effectively adsorbed
   formaldehyde with an adsorption capacity of 1.4 mmol(HCHO) g(-1) whereas
   the aminosilica containing secondary amines showed lower adsorption
   capacity (0.80 mmol(HCHO) g(-1)) and the aminosilica containing tertiary
   amines adsorbed a negligible amount of formaldehyde. The primary amine
   containing silica also successfully abated higher aldehyde VOC
   pollutants, including acetaldehyde, hexanal, and benzaldehyde, by
   effectively adsorbing them. The adsorption mechanism is investigated by
   C-13 CP MAS solid-state NMR and FT-Raman spectroscopy, and it is
   demonstrated that the aldehydes are chemically attached to the surface
   of aminosilica in the form of imines and hemiaminals. The high aldehyde
   adsorption capacities of the primary aminosilicas in this study
   demonstrate the utility of amine-functionalized silica materials for
   reduction of gaseous aldehydes.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium telluride (CdTe) tetrapods were synthesized via multiple

   Subsequently, tetrapod-shaped semiconducting inorganic-organic

   by directly grafting conjugated polymer ethynyl-terminated
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (i.e., P3HT-) onto azide-functionalized CdTe
   tetrapods (i.e., CdTe-N-3) via a catalyst-free click chemistry. The
   intimate contact between P3HT and CdTe tetrapod rendered the effective
   dispersion of CdTe tetrapods in nanocomposites and facilitated their
   efficient electronic interaction. The success of coupling reaction was
   confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The grafting density of P3HT chains on
   the CdTe tetrapods was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis. The
   photophysical properties of P3HT-CdTe tetrapod nanocomposites were
   studied using UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscopies. These
   intimate semiconducting conjugated polymer-tetrapod nanocomposites may
   offer a maximized interface between conjugated polymers and tetrapods

Abstract = {{The spall properties of rolled Al 5083-H116 plate are investigated using
   symmetric plate impact experiments over the stress range 1.5-6.2 GPa.
   Rear free surface velocity measurements made employing Velocity
   Interferometer System for Any Reflector interferometry reveal velocity
   profiles with clear signals of the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and
   velocity pullback, indicative of a transition from elastic to plastic
   behavior and spalling. Experiments were performed on samples obtained
   both through the thickness and along all of the three principal axes of
   the rolled plate. For impact through the thickness, the average values
   of the HEL and spall strength are 0.43 GPa and 0.81 GPa, respectively.
   Decreasing the flyer plate and sample thicknesses resulted in an
   increased spall strength value of 0.95 GPa, while the HEL remained the
   same. The spall strength along the longitudinal (rolling) direction was
   1.06 GPa versus 0.95 GPa for impact along either transverse direction.
   Spall damage for this impact direction often propagated away from the
   spall plane in the direction of impact and along the grain boundaries.
   For impact through the thickness, the fracture surface revealed a mixed
   mode of ductile and intergranular fracture that was not present for the
   fracture surface in the other two directions. This mixed fracture mode
   seems to correspond to a shoulder observed in the free surface velocity
   traces after the pullback. In all cases, cracked brittle inclusions were
   observed near the spall damage regions, indicating their role in
   nucleating voids during spall failure. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A nonrigid B-spline-based point-matching (BPM) method is proposed to
   match dense surface points. The method solves both the point
   correspondence and nonrigid transformation without features extraction.
   The registration method integrates a motion model, which combines a
   global transformation and a B-spline-based local deformation, into a
   robust point-matching framework. The point correspondence and deformable
   transformation are estimated simultaneously by fuzzy correspondence and
   by a deterministic annealing technique. Prior information about global
   translation, rotation and scaling is incorporated into the optimization.
   A local B-spline motion model decreases the degrees of freedom for
   optimization and thus enables the registration of a larger number of
   feature points. The performance of the BPM method has been demonstrated
   and validated using synthesized 2D and 3D data, mouse MRI and micro-CT
   images. The proposed BPM method can be used to register feature point
   sets, 2D curves, 3D surfaces and various image data.}},

Abstract = {{We study the role of individual reaction rates on engine performance,
   with an emphasis on the contribution of quantum tunneling. It is
   demonstrated that the effect of quantum tunneling corrections for the
   reaction HO2 + HO2 = H2O2 +O-2 can have a noticeable impact on the
   performance of a high-fidelity model of a compression-ignition (e.g.,
   diesel) engine, and that an accurate prediction of ignition delay time
   for the engine model requires an accurate estimation of the tunneling
   correction for this reaction. The three-dimensional model includes
   detailed descriptions of the chemistry of a surrogate for a biodiesel
   fuel, as well as all the features of the engine, such as the liquid fuel
   spray and turbulence. This study is part of a larger investigation of
   how the features of the dynamics and potential energy surfaces of key
   reactions, as well as their reaction rate uncertainties, affect engine
   performance, and results in these directions are also presented here.}},

Abstract = {{The detailed characterization of solution-derived nickel (II) oxide
   (NiO) hole-transporting layer (HTL) films and their application in high
   efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is reported. The NiO
   precursor solution is examined in situ to determine the chemical species
   present. Coordination complexes of monoethanolamine (MEA) with Ni in
   ethanol thermally decompose to form non-stoichiometric NiO.
   Specifically, the {[}Ni(MEA)2(OAc)]+ ion is found to be the most
   prevalent species in the precursor solution. The defect-induced Ni3+
   ion, which is present in non-stoichiometric NiO and signifies the p-type
   conduction of NiO, as well as the dipolar nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH)
   species are confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a polymer/fullerene photoactive
   layer blend composed of poly-dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione
   (pDTG-TPD) and {[}6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are
   fabricated using these solution-processed NiO films. The resulting
   devices show an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.8\%,
   which is a 15\% improvement over devices utilizing a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL.
   The enhancement is due to the optical resonance in the solar cell and
   the hydrophobicity of NiO, which promotes a more homogeneous
   donor/acceptor morphology in the active layer at the NiO/BHJ interface.
   Finally, devices incorporating NiO as a HTL are more stable in air than
   devices using PEDOT:PSS.}},

Abstract = {{ERK controls gene expression in development, but mechanisms that link
   ERK activation to changes in transcription are not well understood. We
   used high-resolution analysis of signaling dynamics to study
   transcriptional interpretation of ERK signaling during Drosophila
   embryogenesis, at a stage when ERK induces transcription of intermediate
   neuroblasts defective (ind), a gene essential for patterning of the
   nerve cord. ERK induces ind by antagonizing its repression by Capicua
   (Cic), a transcription factor that acts as a sensor of receptor tyrosine
   kinases in animal development and human diseases. A recent study
   established that active ERK reduces the nuclear levels of Cic, but it
   remained unclear whether this is required for the induction of Cic
   target genes. We provide evidence that Cic binding sites within the
   regulatory DNA of ind control the spatial extent and the timing of ind
   expression. At the same time, we demonstrate that ERK induces ind before
   Cic levels in the nucleus are reduced. Based on this, we propose that
   ERK-dependent relief of gene repression by Cic is a two-step process, in
   which fast reduction of repressor activity is followed by slower changes
   in nuclear localization and overall protein levels. This may be a common
   feature of systems in which ERK induces genes by relief of
   transcriptional repression.}},

Abstract = {{Dislocation nucleation is fundamental to mechanical properties of
   nanocrystalline (nc) materials. At grain size less than 100 nm,
   dislocations have been observed to nucleate predominantly from grain
   boundaries. Here, we report a process of dislocation generation
   originated hierarchically from different microstructural components in
   nc-copper from an atomistic simulation. We show that the sequential
   nucleation is dictated by the internal stress associated with the
   microstructural entities: First from the vertex points where internal
   stress is highest, next from triple junctions, and then from grain
   boundaries with lower internal stress. This connection suggests
   effective solutions for engineering mechanical properties of nc
   materials. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   robust to process variations. Using this technique, we have reduced the
   random variation of the resonance wavelength of 4 mu m diameter
   resonators by a factor of 6 to below 50 pm. The level of accuracy
   achieved in this work is adequate for most of the RF-photonic,
   interconnect, and optical signal processing applications. We also

Abstract = {{The California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change
   (CalNex) field study was conducted throughout California in May, June,
   and July of 2010. The study was organized to address issues
   simultaneously relevant to atmospheric pollution and climate change,
   including (1) emission inventory assessment, (2) atmospheric transport
   and dispersion, (3) atmospheric chemical processing, and (4)
   cloud-aerosol interactions and aerosol radiative effects. Measurements
   from networks of ground sites, a research ship, tall towers,
   balloon-borne ozonesondes, multiple aircraft, and satellites provided in
   situ and remotely sensed data on trace pollutant and greenhouse gas
   concentrations, aerosol chemical composition and microphysical
   properties, cloud microphysics, and meteorological parameters. This
   overview report provides operational information for the variety of
   sites, platforms, and measurements, their joint deployment strategy, and
   summarizes findings that have resulted from the collaborative analyses
   of the CalNex field study. Climate-relevant findings from CalNex include
   that leakage from natural gas infrastructure may account for the excess
   of observed methane over emission estimates in Los Angeles. Air-quality
   relevant findings include the following: mobile fleet VOC significantly
   declines, and NOx emissions continue to have an impact on ozone in the
   Los Angeles basin; the relative contributions of diesel and gasoline
   emission to secondary organic aerosol are not fully understood; and
   nighttime NO3 chemistry contributes significantly to secondary organic
   aerosol mass in the San Joaquin Valley. Findings simultaneously relevant
   to climate and air quality include the following: marine vessel
   emissions changes due to fuel sulfur and speed controls result in a net
   warming effect but have substantial positive impacts on local air
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Getting seismic data from the deep oceans usually involves ocean-bottom
   seismometers, but hydrophone arrays may provide a practical alternative
   means of obtaining vector data. We here explore this possibility using
   hydrophone stations of the International Monitoring System, which have
   been used to study icebergs and T-wave propagation among others. These
   stations consist of three hydrophones at about the depth of the deep
   sound channel in a horizontal triangle array with 2km sides. We use data
   from these stations in the very low-frequency regime (0.01-0.05Hz band)
   to demonstrate that these stations can also be used as water column
   seismometers. By differencing the acoustic pressure, we obtain vector
   quantities analogous to what a seismometer would record. Comparing
   processed hydrophone station records of the 2004 Great Sumatra-Andaman
   Earthquake with broadband seismograms from a nearby island station, we
   find that the differenced hydrophones are indeed a practical surrogate
   for seismometers.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of CCL15 Expression and Monocyte Adhesion to Endothelial

Abstract = {{CCL15, a member of the CC chemokine family, is a potent chemoattractant
   for leukocytes and endothelial cells (ECs). Given that chemokines play
   key roles in vascular inflammation, we investigated the effects of
   hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) on expression of human CCL15 and a role of
   CCL15 in upregulating ICAM-1 in ECs. We found that exposure of ECs to
   H/R increased expression of CCL15 and ICAM-1, which resulted in an
   increase in monocyte adhesivity to the ECs. Further studies revealed
   that knockdown of CCL15 or CCR1 attenuated expression of ICAM-1 in ECs
   after H/R, suggesting that expression of ICAM-1 is upregulated by CCL15.
   Stimulation of ECs with CCL15 significantly increased expression of
   ICAM-1 predominantly via the CCR1 receptor. We observed that
   phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 was stimulated by CCL15 treatment of
   ECs. Results from reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
   revealed that CCL15 activates transcription from the IFN-gamma
   activation site promoter and stimulates binding of STAT3 to the ICAM-1
   promoter. Our data also showed that CCL15 increased cell adhesion of
   human monocytes to ECs under static and shear-stress conditions.
   Pretreatment of these cells with inhibitors for JAK, PI3K, and AKT
   prevented the CCL15-induced expression of ICAM-1 and monocyte adhesion
   to ECs, suggesting the involvement of those signaling molecules in
   ICAM-1 gene activation by CCL15. The results suggest that CCR1 and its
   ligands may be a potential target for treating inflammatory diseases
   involving upregulation of cell adhesion molecules.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate 2 x 56 Gb/s two-channel
   polarization-division-multiplexing quadrature-phase-shift-keying signal
   delivery over 80 km single-mode fiber-28 and 2 m Q-band (33-50 GHz)
   wireless link, adopting antenna horizontal- (H-) and
   vertical-polarization (V-polarization) multiplexing. At the wireless
   receiver, classic constant-modulus-algorithm equalization based on
   digital signal processing can realize polarization demultiplexing and
   remove the crosstalk at the same antenna polarization. By adopting
   antenna polarization multiplexing, the signal baud rate and performance
   requirements for optical and wireless devices can be reduced but at the
   cost of double antennas and devices, while wireless transmission
   capacity can also be increased but at the cost of stricter requirements
   for V-polarization. The isolation is only about 19 dB when
   V-polarization deviation approaches 10 degrees, which will affect
   high-speed (>50 Gb/s) wireless delivery. (c) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Motivation: Abrupt reduction/resumption of thermal fluctuations of a
   force probe has been used to identify association/dissociation events of
   protein-ligand bonds. We show that off-rate of molecular dissociation
   can be estimated by the analysis of the bond lifetime, while the on-rate
   of molecular association can be estimated by the analysis of the waiting
   time between two neighboring bond events. However, the analysis relies
   heavily on subjective judgments and is time-consuming. To automate the
   process of mapping out bond events from thermal fluctuation data, we
   develop a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method.
   Results: The HMM method represents the bond state by a hidden variable
   with two values: bound and unbound. The bond association/dissociation is
   visualized and pinpointed. We apply the method to analyze a key
   receptor-ligand interaction in the early stage of hemostasis and
   thrombosis: the von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to platelet
   glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb alpha). The numbers of bond lifetime and
   waiting time events estimated by the HMM are much more than those
   estimated by a descriptive statistical method from the same set of raw
   data. The kinetic parameters estimated by the HMM are in excellent
   agreement with those by a descriptive statistical analysis, but have
   much smaller errors for both wild-type and two mutant VWF-A1 domains.
   Thus, the computerized analysis allows us to speed up the analysis and
   improve the quality of estimates of receptor-ligand binding kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques have become invaluable,
   high-throughput tools to study gene expression. However, the need to
   measure gene expression patterns quickly and affordably, useful for
   applications such as stem cell biomanufacturing requiring real-time
   observation and control, has not been adequately met by rapid qPCR
   instrumentation to date. We report a reverse transcription, microfluidic
   qPCR system and its application to DNA and RNA amplification
   measurement. In the system, an environmental control fixture provides
   mechanical and thermal repeatability for an infrared laser to achieve
   both accurate and precise open-loop temperature control of 1 mu l
   reaction volumes in a low-cost polymer microfluidic chip with concurrent
   fluorescence imaging. We have used this system to amplify serial
   dilutions of lambda-phage DNA (10(5)-10(7) starting copies) and RNA
   transcripts from the GAPDH housekeeping gene (5.45 ng total mouse
   embryonic stem cell RNA) and measured associated standard curves,
   efficiency (57\%), repeatability (similar to 1 cycle threshold), melting
   curves, and specificity. This microfluidic qRT-PCR system offers a
   practical approach to rapid analysis (similar to 1 h), combining the
   cost benefits of small reagent volumes with the simplicity of disposable
   polymer microchips and easy setup. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cel5A, an endoglucanase, was derived from the metagenomic library of
   vermicompost. The deduced amino acid sequence of Cel5A shows high
   sequence homology with family-5 glycoside hydrolases, which contain a
   single catalytic domain but no distinct cellulose-binding domain. Random
   mutagenesis and cellulose-binding module (CBM) fusion approaches were
   successfully applied to obtain properties required for cellulose
   hydrolysis. After two rounds of error-prone PCR and screening of 3,000
   mutants, amino acid substitutions were identified at various positions
   in thermotolerant mutants. The most heat-tolerant mutant, Cel5A\_2R2,
   showed a 7-fold increase in thermostability. To enhance the affinity and
   hydrolytic activity of Cel5A on cellulose substrates, the family-6 CBM
   from Saccharophagus degradans was fused to the C-terminus of the
   Cel5A\_2R2 mutant using overlap PCR. The Cel5A\_2R2-CBM6 fusion protein
   showed 7-fold higher activity than the native Cel5A on Avicel and filter
   paper. Cellobiose was a major product obtained from the hydrolysis of
   cellulosic substrates by the fusion enzyme, which was identified by
   using thin layer chromatography analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose-based paper remains a vital component of modern day society;
   however, its use is severely in certain applications because of
   hydrophilic and oleophilic properties. In this manuscript we present a
   novel method to create superamphiphobic paper by combining the control
   of fiber size and structure with plasma etching and fluoropolymer
   deposition. The heterogeneous nature of the paper structure is
   drastically different from that of artificially created superamphiphobic
   surfaces. By refining the wood fibers, smaller diameter fibers (fibrils)
   are created to support fluid droplets. After oxygen plasma etching and
   deposition of a fluoropolymer film, paper samples are able to support
   motor oil contact angles of 149 +/- 30 degrees, although these
   structures readily absorb n-hexadecane. Exchange of water in the pulp
   solution with sec-butanol provides, additional control over fiber
   spacing to create superamphiphobic substrates with contact angles >150
   degrees for water, ethylene glycol, motor oil, and n-hexadecane.}},

Abstract = {{Focal adhesions mediate force transfer between ECM-integrin complexes
   and the cytoskeleton. Although vinculin has been implicated in force
   transmission, few direct measurements have been made, and there is
   little mechanistic insight. Using vinculin-null cells expressing
   vinculin mutants, we demonstrate that vinculin is not required for
   transmission of adhesive and traction forces but is necessary for myosin
   contractility-dependent adhesion strength and traction force and for the
   coupling of cell area and traction force. Adhesion strength and traction
   forces depend differentially on vinculin head (V-H) and tail domains.
   V-H enhances adhesion strength by increasing ECM-bound integrin-talin
   complexes, independently from interactions with vinculin tail ligands
   and contractility. A full-length, autoinhibition-deficient mutant (T12)
   increases adhesion strength compared with V-H, implying roles for both
   vinculin activation and the actin-binding tail. In contrast to adhesion
   strength, vinculin-dependent traction forces absolutely require a
   full-length and activated molecule; V-H has no effect. Physical linkage
   of the head and tail domains is required for maximal force responses.
   Residence times of vinculin in focal adhesions, but not T12 or V-H,
   correlate with applied force, supporting a mechanosensitive model for
   vinculin activation in which forces stabilize vinculin's active
   conformation to promote force transfer.}},

   polystyrene (PS) yarns composed of bundles of nanofibrils by using a
   proper combination of solvent and relative humidity. We elucidated the
   mechanism responsible for the formation of this new morphology by
   systematically investigating the molecular interactions among the
   polymer, solvent(s), and water vapor. We demonstrated that vapor-induced
   phase separation played a pivotal role in generating the yarns with a
   unique structure. Furthermore, we discovered that the low vapor pressure
   of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was critical to the evolution of pores in
   the interiors. On the contrary, the relatively high vapor pressure of
   tetrahydrofuran (THF) hindered the formation of interior pores but
   excelled in creating a rough surface. In all cases, our results clearly
   indicate that the formation of either internal porosity or surface
   roughness required the presence of water vapor, a nonsolvent of the
   polymer, at a proper level of relative humidity. The exact morphology or
   pore structure was dependent on the speed of evaporation of the
   solvent(s) (DMF, THF, and their mixtures) as well as the interdiffusion
   and penetration of the nonsolvent (water) and solvent(s). Our findings
   can serve as guidelines for the preparation of fibers with desired
   porosity both internally and externally through electrospinning.}},

Abstract = {{Topologically disordered metallic glasses (MGs) are known for
   exceedingly high elastic limit (2\%-3\%) and large local deformation at
   the onset of yielding in the form of shear banding. However, the
   manifestation of the large elastic deformation has not been taken into
   consideration in understanding the overall mechanical responses. By
   applying a finite deformation theory to initially isotropic solids under
   uniaxial loading, we investigate the nonlinear elastic behavior and its
   effects on mechanical properties. We take bulk metallic glass (BMG)
   Zr52.5Ti5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10 as an example which is the only system by far
   with the experimentally measured nonlinear elastic constants up to the
   fourth order available for our theory. We show that the uniaxial loading
   breaks the isotropic symmetry of the MG and makes it transversely
   isotropic. We also predict the strain dependence of Poisson's ratio,
   Young's modulus, and anisotropic coefficients of the amorphous solids.
   Our work also gives the first estimate of the theoretical stress-strain
   relations and the elastic stability conditions under uniaxial loading
   from which we obtain the maximum tensile and compressive strengths and
   intrinsic deformation modes at the corresponding maximum stresses.
   Although depicting ideal scenarios, the theoretical results provide a
   useful reference for understanding mechanical response of MGs at large
   deformation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo generated deuterated bacterial cellulose, cultivated from 100\%
   deuterated glycerol in D2O medium, was analyzed for deuterium
   incorporation by ionic liquid dissolution and H-2 and H-1 nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR). A solution NMR method of the dissolved
   cellulose was used to determine that this bacterial cellulose had 85\%
   deuterium incorporation. Acetylation and H-1 and H-2 NMR of deuterated
   bacterial cellulose indicated near equal deuteration at all sites of the
   glucopyranosyl ring except C-6 which was partly deuterated. Despite the
   high level of deuterium incorporation no significant differences in the
   molecular and morphological properties were observed for the deuterated
   and protio bacterial cellulose samples. The highly deuterated bacterial
   cellulose presented here can be used as a model substrate for studying
   cellulose biopolymer properties via future small angle neutron
   scattering (SANS) studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The output of a piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) fabricated using ZnO
   nanowire arrays is largely influenced by the density of the surface
   charge carriers at the nanowire surfaces. Adsorption of gas molecules
   could modify the surface carrier density through a screening effect,
   thus, the output of the NG is sensitive to the gas concentration. Based
   on such a mechanism, we first studied the responses of an unpackaged NG
   to oxygen, H2S and water vapor, and demonstrated its sensitivity to H2S
   to a level as low as 100 ppm. Therefore, the piezoelectric signal
   generated by a ZnO NWs NG can act not only as a power source, but also
   as a response signal to the gas, demonstrating a possible approach as a
   self-powered active gas sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells composed of conjugated polymers
   (CPs) and inorganic nanocrystal (NC) semiconductors have garnered
   considerable attention as a potential alternative to traditional silicon
   solar cells due to the capacity of producing high-efficiency solar
   energy in a cost-effective manner. The combination of advantageous
   characteristics of CPs and NCs enables the construction of
   nanostructured high-performance, lightweight, flexible, large-area, and
   low-cost hybrid solar cells. However, it remains a grand challenge to
   control the film morphology and interfacial structure of such
   organic/inorganic semiconductor blends on the nanoscale. In this
   Perspective, we highlight the strategies of implementing close contact
   between CPs and NCs by tailoring the colloidal synthesis, the
   coordination reaction, and the chemical modification of CPs. As such,
   they offer promising opportunities for rationally controlling the phase
   separation between electron-donating CPs and electron-accepting NCs,
   increasing the interfacial areas between them, enhancing their
   electronic interaction, and thus substantially promoting the
   photovoltaic performance of the resulting organic-inorganic hybrid solar

Abstract = {{Understanding the topological configurations of chromatin may reveal
   valuable insights into how the genome and epigenome act in concert to
   control cell fate during development. Here, we generate high-resolution
   architecture maps across seven genomic loci in embryonic stem cells and
   neural progenitor cells. We observe a hierarchy of 3D interactions that
   undergo marked reorganization at the submegabase scale during
   differentiation. Distinct combinations of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF),
   Mediator, and cohesin show widespread enrichment in chromatin
   interactions at different length scales. CTCF/cohesin anchor long-range
   constitutive interactions that might form the topological basis for
   invariant subdomains. Conversely, Mediator/cohesin bridge short-range
   enhancer-promoter interactions within and between larger subdomains.
   Knockdown of Smc1 or Med12 in embryonic stem cells results in disruption
   of spatial architecture and downregulation of genes found in
   cohesin-mediated interactions. We conclude that cell-type-specific
   chromatin organization occurs at the submegabase scale and that
   architectural proteins shape the genome in hierarchical length scales.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags have been actively
   explored as a multiplexing platform for sensitive detection of
   biomolecules. Here, we report a new type of SERS tags that was
   fabricated by sequentially functionalizing dimers made of 50 nm Ag
   nanospheres with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid as the Raman reporter molecule,
   silica coating as a protective shell and antibody as a targeting ligand.
   These dimer-based tags give highly enhanced and reproducible Raman
   signals owing to the presence of a well-defined SERS hot spot at the
   junction between two Ag nanospheres in the dimer. The SERS enhancement
   factor (EF) of an individual dimer tag supported on a glass slide can
   reach a level as high as 4.3 x 10(6). In comparison, the EFs dropped to
   2.8 x 10(5) and 8.7 x 10(5), respectively, when Ag nanospheres and
   nanocubes with sizes similar to the spheres in the dimer were used to
   fabricate the tags using similar procedures. The SERS signals from
   aqueous suspensions of the dimer-based tags also showed high intensity
   and good stability. Potential use of the dimer-based tags was
   demonstrated by imaging cancer cells overexpressing HER2 receptors with
   good specificity and high sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{A mosaic of protected areas, including indigenous lands, sustainable-use
   production forests and reserves and strictly protected forests is the
   cornerstone of conservation in the Amazon, with almost 50 per cent of
   the region now protected. However, recent research indicates that
   isolation from direct deforestation or degradation may not be sufficient
   to maintain the ecological integrity of Amazon forests over the next
   several decades. Large-scale changes in fire and drought regimes
   occurring as a result of deforestation and greenhouse gas increases may
   result in forest degradation, regardless of protected status. How severe
   or widespread these feedbacks will be is uncertain, but the arc of
   deforestation in south-southeastern Amazonia appears to be particularly
   vulnerable owing to high current deforestation rates and ecological
   sensitivity to climate change. Maintaining forest ecosystem integrity
   may require significant strengthening of forest conservation on private
   property, which can in part be accomplished by leveraging existing
   policy mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We report buckling-driven delamination of carbon nanotube (CNT) forests
   from their growth substrates when subjected to compression. Macroscale
   compression experiments reveal local delamination at the CNT
   forest-substrate interface. Results of microscale flat punch
   indentations indicate that enhanced CNT interlocking at the top surface
   of the forest accomplished by application of a metal coating causes
   delamination of the forest from the growth substrate, a phenomenon not
   observed in indentation of as-grown CNT forests. We postulate that the
   post-buckling tensile stresses that develop at the base of the CNT
   forests serve as the driving force for delamination. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Nanoscale Nd-Fe-B particles were fabricated with room temperature
   coercivity of 4.9 kOe by attrition (stirred media) milling. For longer
   milling times, more than 80\% of the particles were less than 500 nm

   process. Anisotropy was demonstrated by field alignment, as shown by
   creation of strong texture in x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Limited
   peak broadening in XRD patterns indicates that attrition milling
   produces less deformation and amorphous material than high-energy
   milling. Compared to other magnetic nanoparticles, the higher coercivity
   is attributed to limited plastic deformation and larger sized particles.

Abstract = {{We study the locomotor mechanics of a small, lightweight robot
   (DynaRoACH, 10 cm, 25 g) which can move on a granular substrate of 3 mm
   diameter glass particles at speeds up to 5 body length/s, approaching
   the performance of certain desert-dwelling animals. To reveal how the
   robot achieves this performance, we used high-speed imaging to capture
   its kinematics, and developed a numerical multi-body simulation of the
   robot coupled to an experimentally validated simulation of the granular
   medium. Average speeds measured in experiment and simulation agreed
   well, and increased nonlinearly with stride frequency, reflecting a
   change in propulsion mode. At low frequencies, the robot used a
   quasi-static ``rotary walking{''} mode, in which the substrate yielded
   as legs penetrated and then solidified once vertical force balance was
   achieved. At high frequencies the robot propelled itself using the
   speed-dependent fluid-like inertial response of the material. The
   simulation allows variation of parameters which are inconvenient to
   modify in experiment, and thus gives insight into how substrate and
   robot properties change performance. Our study reveals how lightweight
   animals can achieve high performance on granular substrates; such

Abstract = {{The polyborosilazane (PBSZ) was employed as the sintering additive and
   the dense ZrB2 ultra-high temperature ceramic samples were fabricated by
   hot pressing at 1900 degrees C. The relative density of sintered
   ceramics is 96.4\%. The PBSZ was converted to amorphous SiBCN ceramics
   after sintering. Mass transfer process was significantly improved in the
   amorphous region among the ZrB2 grains. Densification temperature was
   reduced. The mechanical properties and high temperature oxidation
   resistance were also enhanced. The bending strength and fracture
   toughness of the ZrB2 ceramics were 241 +/- 10 MPa and 4.47 +/- 0.5 MPa
   m(1/2), respectively. The crack was deflected along the grain
   boundaries. During high-temperature oxidation process, the grain
   boundary at SiBCN ceramic was oxidized into borosilicate glass and the
   low viscous glass was extruded out and spread over the surface quickly.
   The continuous oxide coating formed on the ZrB2 ceramics surface
   prevented further oxidation. (C)2013 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All

Abstract = {{The coupled displacement process of fluid injection into a dense
   granular medium is investigated numerically using a discrete element
   method (DEM) code PFC2D((R)) coupled with a pore network fluid flow
   scheme. How a dense granular medium behaves in response to fluid
   injection is a subject of fundamental and applied research interests to
   better understand subsurface processes such as fluid or gas migration
   and formation of intrusive features as well as engineering applications
   such as hydraulic fracturing and geological storage in unconsolidated
   formations. The numerical analysis is performed with DEM executing the
   mechanical calculation and the network model solving the
   Hagen-Poiseuille equation between the pore spaces enclosed by chains of
   particles and contacts. Hydromechanical coupling is realized by data
   exchanging at predetermined time steps. The numerical results show that
   increase in the injection rate and the invading fluid viscosity and
   decrease in the modulus and permeability of the medium result in fluid
   flow behaviors displaying a transition from infiltration-governed to
   infiltration-limited and the granular medium responses evolving from
   that of a rigid porous medium to localized failure leading to the
   development of preferential paths. The transition in the fluid flow and
   granular medium behaviors is governed by the ratio between the
   characteristic times associated with fluid injection and hydromechanical
   coupling. The peak pressures at large injection rates when fluid leakoff
   is limited compare well with those from the injection experiments in
   triaxial cells in the literature. The numerical analysis also reveals
   intriguing tip kinematics field for the growth of a fluid channel, which
   may shed light on the occurrence of the apical inverted-conical features
   in sandstone and magma intrusion in unconsolidated formations.}},

Title = {{Thermal Characteristics of Open and Contained Data Center Cold Aisle}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cold aisle containment is used in raised floor, air cooled data centers
   to minimize direct mixing between the supplied cold air and the hot air
   exiting from the servers. The objective of such a system is to minimize
   the server inlet air temperatures. In this paper, large scale air
   temperature field measurements are performed to investigate the hot air
   entrainment characteristics in the cold aisle in both open and contained
   aisle conditions. Both under-provisioned and over-provisioned scenarios
   were examined. Thermal field measurements suggest significant
   improvement in the cold air delivery for the case with contained aisle
   as compared to open aisle. Even for an over-provisioned case with open
   aisle, hot air entrainment was observed from the aisle entrance;
   however, for the contained aisle condition, close to perfect cold air
   delivery to the racks was observed. For both under-provisioned and
   over-provisioned cases, the aisle containment tended to equalize the
   tile and rack air flow rates. Balance air is expected to be leaked into
   or out of the containment to makeup the flow rate difference for the
   contained aisle condition. The CFD modeling strategy at the aisle level
   is also discussed for open aisle condition. Our previous investigation
   for rack level modeling has shown that consideration of momentum rise
   above the tile surface improves the predictive capability as compared to
   the generally used porous jump model. The porous jump model only
   specifies a step pressure loss at the tile surface without any influence
   on flow field. The momentum rise above the tile surface was included
   using a modified body force model by artificially specifying a momentum
   source above the tile surface. The modified body force model suggested
   higher air entrainment and higher reach of cold air as compared to the
   porous jump model. The modified body force model was able to better
   capture hot air entrainment through aisle entrance and compared well
   with the experimental data for the end racks. The generally used porous
   jump model suggested lower hot air entrainment and under predicted the
   server inlet temperatures for end racks.}},

Title = {{Wideband Tunable Omnidirectional Infrared Absorbers Based on
   Doped-Silicon Nanowire Arrays}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The present study considers the directional and spectral radiative
   properties of vertically aligned, heavily doped silicon nanowires for
   applications as broadband infrared diffuse absorbers. The nanowire array
   is modeled as a uniaxial medium whose anisotropic dielectric function is
   based on an effective medium theory. The approximation model is verified
   by the finite-difference time-domain method. It is found that the
   radiative properties of this type of nanostructured material could be
   tailored by controlling the doping concentration, volume filling ratio,
   and length of the nanowires. Increasing the wire length yields a
   broadening of the absorption plateau, while increasing the doping
   concentration results in a shift of the plateau to shorter wavelengths.
   Moreover, two kinds of omnidirectional absorbers/emitters could be
   realized based on the doped-silicon nanowire arrays. The first one is a
   wavelength-tunable wideband absorber, which may be important for
   applications in thermal imaging and thermophotovoltaic devices. The
   second acts as a quasi-blackbody in the wavelength region from 3 to 17
   mu m and, therefore, is promising for use as an absorber in bolometers
   that measure infrared radiation and as an emitter in space cooling
   devices that dissipate heat into free space via thermal radiation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model-based computationally efficient method for
   detecting milling chatter in its incipient stages and for chatter
   frequency estimation by monitoring the cutting force signals. Based on a
   complex exponentials model for the dynamic chip thickness, the chip
   regeneration effect is amplified and isolated from the cutting force
   signal for early chatter detection. The proposed method is independent
   of the cutting conditions. With the aid of a one tap adaptive filter,
   the method is shown to be capable of distinguishing between chatter and
   the dynamic transients in the cutting forces arising from sudden changes
   in workpiece geometry and tool entry/exit. To facilitate chatter
   suppression once the onset of chatter is detected, a time domain
   algorithm is proposed so that the dominant chatter frequency can be
   accurately determined without using computationally expensive frequency
   domain transforms such as the Fourier transform. The proposed method is
   experimentally validated.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic fluctuations and geomorphic heterogeneity are expected to
   produce substantial variability in solute transport within rivers.
   However, this variability has not been sufficiently explored due to the
   limited availability of solute injection data in most rivers. Here, we
   analyzed 81 tracer injection breakthrough curves (BTCs) along Stringer
   Creek, a 5.5km(2) watershed in Montana. BTC measurements were obtained
   for three baseflow conditions at 27 reaches along a 2600m stream
   channel. BTCs in upstream reaches (first 1400m) had receding tails with
   shallow slopes, indicating high solute retention. Conversely, BTCs in
   downstream reaches (1400 to 2600m) had receding tails with steeper
   slopes, indicating low solute retention relative to upstream reaches.
   Difference in BTC tails along the stream channel coincided with changes
   in channel morphology and bedrock geology. Specifically, channel slope
   increases from 5-6\% (upstream) to 9\% (downstream), channel sinuosity
   decreases from a maximum of 1.32 (upstream) to 1.02 (downstream), and
   the underlying bedrock changes from sandstone (upstream) to
   granite-gneiss (downstream). Importantly, intrastream differences in BTC
   tails were distinctly observable only during the two lowest baseflow
   conditions. Spatial variability of BTC tail-slopes was most sensitive to
   changes in local discharge at low flow, and to changes in channel
   sinuosity at high flow. BTC tail-slopes varied temporally with local
   discharge and velocity at upstream reaches, but not at downstream
   reaches. These results suggest that local interactions between channel
   morphology and solute retention vary with hydrologic conditions, and
   that solute retention becomes more homogeneous at higher stream
   discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Operating cranes is challenging because payloads can experience large
   and dangerous oscillations. The oscillations are induced by both
   intentional motions commanded by the human operator and by external
   disturbances. Although significant progress has been achieved by using
   command shaping to reduce operator-induced vibration, less success has
   been achieved on reducing oscillations induced by external disturbances,
   such as wind. The disturbance-rejection task is more challenging because
   it requires accurate sensing of the crane payload. This study presents a
   combined command shaping and feedback control architecture. The input
   shaper eliminates the payload oscillation caused by human-operator
   commands, and the feedback controller reduces the effect of wind gusts.
   Simulations of a large range of motions are used to analyse the dynamic
   behaviour of boom cranes using the proposed controller. Experimental
   results obtained from a small-scale boom crane validate the simulated
   dynamic behaviour and the effectiveness of the controller.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction are a critical component that may
   dramatically enhance the performance of fuel cells and metal-air
   batteries, which may provide the power for future electric vehicles.
   Here we report a novel bio-inspired composite electrocatalyst, iron
   phthalocyanine with an axial ligand anchored on single-walled carbon
   nanotubes, demonstrating higher electrocatalytic activity for oxygen
   reduction than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst as well as exceptional
   durability during cycling in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations
   suggest that the rehybridization of Fe 3d orbitals with the ligand
   orbitals coordinated from the axial direction results in a significant
   change in electronic and geometric structure, which greatly increases
   the rate of oxygen reduction reaction. Our results demonstrate a new
   strategy to rationally design inexpensive and durable electrochemical
   oxygen reduction catalysts for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{Code-multiplexed transmitted reference (CM-TR) and code-shifted
   reference (CSR) have recently drawn attention in the field of
   ultra-wideband communications mainly because they enable noncoherent
   detection without requiring either a delay component, as in transmitted
   reference, or an analog carrier, as in frequency-shifted reference, to
   separate the reference and data-modulated signals at the receiver. In
   this paper, we propose a generalized code-multiplexing (GCM) system
   based on the formulation of a constrained mixed-integer optimization
   problem. The GCM extends the concept of CM-TR and CSR while retaining
   their simple receiver structure, even offering better bit-error-rate
   performance and a higher data rate in the sense that more data symbols
   can be embedded in each transmitted block. The GCM framework is further
   extended to the cases when peak power constraint is considered and when
   inter-frame interference exists, as typically occurs in high data-rate
   transmissions. Numerical simulations performed over demanding wireless
   environments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous popularity of smart phones and electronic tablets has
   spurred the explosive growth of high-rate multimedia services and
   promptly boomed energy consumption in wireless networks. Therefore,
   energy-efficient design in wireless networks is very important and is
   attracting more and more attention, just like the conventional
   spectral-efficient design. In this paper, we study energy-efficient
   design in downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
   networks with effective capacity-based delay provisioning for
   delay-sensitive traffic. By integrating information theory with the
   concept of effective capacity, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE)
   optimization problem with statistical delay provisioning, which is a
   complicated nonconvex combinatorial fractional programming problem. To
   solve the problem, we first relax it with an upper bound on the original
   one and then prove and exploit the quasiconcave property of the
   EE-versus-transmit power curve, which facilitates the optimal algorithm
   development. Then, we demonstrate that the resultant solution is quite
   close to the true optimal value when the number of subcarriers is larger
   than that of the users. We also analyze the tradeoff between EE and
   delay, the relationship between spectral-efficient and energy-efficient
   designs, and the impact of system parameters, including circuit power
   and delay exponents, on the overall performance. Numerical results show
   that the proposed energy-efficient design scheme greatly improves EE
   while maintaining the delay requirement.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3292-3305}},

Abstract = {{Arid regions are characterized by high variability in the arrival of
   rainfall, and species found in these areas have adapted mechanisms to
   ensure the capture of this scarce resource. In particular, the rooting
   strategies employed by vegetation can be critical to their survival.
   However, land surface models currently prescribe rooting profiles as a
   function of only the plant functional type of interest with no
   consideration for the soil texture or rainfall regime of the region
   being modeled. Additionally, these models do not incorporate the ability
   of vegetation to dynamically alter their rooting strategies in response
   to transient changes in environmental forcings or competition from other
   plant species and therefore tend to underestimate the resilience of
   these ecosystems. To address the simplicity of the current
   representation of roots in land surface models, a new dynamic rooting
   scheme was incorporated into the framework of the distributed
   ecohydrological model tRIBS+VEGGIE. The new scheme optimizes the
   allocation of carbon to the root zone to reduce the perceived stress of
   the vegetation, so that root profiles evolve based upon local climate
   and soil conditions. The ability of the new scheme to capture the
   complex dynamics of natural systems was evaluated by comparisons to
   hourly timescale energy flux, soil moisture, and vegetation growth
   observations from the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona.
   Robust agreement was found between the model and observations, providing
   confidence that the improved model is able to capture the
   multidirectional interactions between climate, soil, and vegetation at
   this site.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in colloidal inorganic nanocrystal synthesis and processing
   have led to the demonstration of organic-inorganic hybrid photovoltaic
   (PV) cells using low-cost solution processes from blends of conjugated
   polymer and colloidal nanocrystals. However, the performance of such
   hybrid PV cells has been limited due to the lack of control at the
   complex interfaces between the organic and inorganic hybrid active
   materials. Here we show that the efficiency of hybrid PV devices can be
   significantly enhanced by engineering the polymer-nanocrystal Interface
   with proper chemical treatment. Using two different conjugated polymers,
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and
   poly{[}2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta{[}2,1-b;3,4-b']-dithioph
   ene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), we show that treating
   the polymer:nanocrystal hybrid film In an ethanedithiol-containing
   acetonitrile solution can increase the efficiency of the hybrid PV
   devices by 30-90\%, and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.2 +/-
   0.3\% was obtained in the PCPDTBT: CdSe devices at 0.2 sun (AM 1.5G),
   which was slightly reduced to 4.7 +/- 0.3\% at 1 sun. The ethanedithiol
   treatment did not result in significant changes in the morphology and
   UV-vis optical absorption of the hybrid thin films; however, infrared
   absorption, NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies revealed the
   effective removal of organic ligands, especially the charged phosphonic
   acid ligands, from the CdSe nanorod surface after the treatment,
   accompanied by the possible monolayer passivation of nanorod surfaces
   with Cd-thiolates. We attribute the hybrid PV cell efficiency Increase
   upon the ethanedithiol treatment to the reduction in charge and exciton
   recombination sites on the nanocrystal surface and the simultaneous
   increase in electron transport through the hybrid film.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystals, despite their tiny sizes, contain thousands to millions of
   atoms. Here we show that the large number of atoms packed in each
   metallic nanocrystal can provide a huge gain in signal amplification for
   biomolecule detection. We have devised a highly sensitive, linear
   amplification scheme by integrating the dissolution of bound
   nanocrystals and metal-induced stoichiometric chromogenesis, and
   demonstrated that signal amplification is fully defined by the size and
   atom density of nanocrystals, which can be optimized through
   well-controlled nanocrystal synthesis. Further, the rich library of
   chromogenic reactions allows implementation of this scheme in various
   assay formats, as demonstrated by the iron oxide nanoparticle linked
   immunosorbent assay (ILISA) and blotting assay developed in this study.
   Our results indicate that, owing to the inherent simplicity, high
   sensitivity and repeatability, the nanocrystal based amplification
   scheme can significantly improve biomolecule quantification in both
   laboratory research and clinical diagnostics. This novel method adds a
   new dimension to current nanoparticle-based bioassays.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that supramolecular assembly and subsequent enhancement
   of charge transport characteristics of conjugated polymers can be
   facilitated simply by adding small amounts of a more volatile poor
   solvent, which can hydrogen bond with the majority solvent. Addition of
   up to 2 vol \% acetone to a precursor solution of poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) in chloroform leads to approximately a 4-fold increase in P3HT
   field-effect mobility. The improvement is associated with hydrogen
   bonding interactions between acetone and chloroform which decrease the
   evaporation rate of the mixed solvent. P3HT is less soluble In the
   binary solvent than in the more readily vaporized chloroform component,
   and this characteristic enables the supramolecular assembly of P3HT
   chains at the nanoscale. Two-dimensional molecular ordering of the
   polymer film was controlled by varying the quantity of poor solvent
   added to the precursor solution, and the correlation between
   field-effect mobility and molecular ordering was investigated. Hansen
   solubility parameters were used to systematically understand how the
   solvent mixture enhances the alignment and assembly of polymer chains
   and influences subsequent thin film properties. The value of the
   relative energy difference (RED) of the solvent with respect to P3HT
   increased from less than 1 to more than 1 during film formation, which
   indicates that the solvent characteristics are Initially those of a good
   solvent but transform into those of a poor dissolution medium. A
   mechanistic illustration of the molecular ordering process during film
   formation is postulated.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive
   transcription factor that activates several antioxidant and
   cytoprotective genes in response to oxidative stress. The role of Nrf2
   activators and the intracellular regulation of Nrf2 have been studied
   extensively. In comparison, little is known about the self-regulation of
   Nrf2 due to experimental techniques commonly used to synchronize
   cellular signaling. Here we report that endogenous Nrf2 was
   downregulated in the nucleus of HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells serum starved
   for 24 h. Nrf2 expression was rescued by the addition of unconditioned
   media irrespective of its serum content. No concomitant change was
   observed in the expression of the primary inhibitor of Nrf2, Kelch-like
   ECH-associated protein-1. Nrf2 was upregulated by tert-butyl
   hydroquinone, although there was limited increase in Nrf2 in conditioned
   media-treated cells as compared to unconditioned media-treated cells.
   Decreasing the fraction of conditioned media in culture resulted in a
   dose-dependent increase in Nrf2 protein level. Taken together, our data
   suggests the existence of a complex self-regulatory mechanism for
   endogenous Nrf2 signaling.}},

Title = {{Improving Playback Quality of Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming Systems by
   Joint Scheduling and Distributed Hash Table Based Compensation}},
Journal = {{CHINA COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{127-145}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming systems, video data may be lost since
   peers can join and leave the overlay network randomly, thereby
   deteriorating the video playback quality. In this paper we propose a new
   hybrid mesh and Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based P2P streaming system,
   called HQMedia, to provide high playback quality to users by maintaining
   high data dissemination resilience with a low overhead. In HQMedia,
   peers are classified into Super Peers (SP) and Common Peers (CP)
   according to their online time. SPs and CPs form a mesh structure, while
   SPs alone form a new Streaming DHT (SDHT) structure. In this hybrid
   architecture, we propose a joint scheduling and compensation mechanism.
   If any frames cannot be obtained during the scheduling phase, an
   SDHT-based compensation mechanism is invoked for retrieving the missing
   frames near the playback point. We evaluate the performance of HQMedia
   by both theoretical analysis and intensive simulation experiments on
   large-scale networks to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
   the proposed system. Numerical results show that HQMedia significantly
   outperforms existing mesh-based and treebased P2P live streaming systems
   by improving playback quality with only less than 1\% extra maintenance
   overhead.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{259}},
Pages = {{130-153}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a geometric discretization scheme for
   incompressible linearized elasticity. We use ideas from discrete
   exterior calculus (DEC) to write the action for a discretized elastic
   body modeled by a simplicial complex. After characterizing the
   configuration manifold of volume-preserving discrete deformations, we
   use Hamilton's principle on this configuration manifold. The discrete
   Euler-Lagrange equations are obtained without using Lagrange
   multipliers. The main difference between our approach and the mixed
   finite element formulations is that we simultaneously use three
   different discrete spaces for the displacement field. We explicitly
   derive the governing equations for the two-dimensional case, where the
   discrete spaces for the displacement field are constructed by P-1
   polynomials over primal meshes for incompressibility constraint, P-0
   polynomials over dual meshes for the kinetic energy, and P-1 polynomials
   over support volumes for the elastic energy, and the discrete space of
   the pressure field is constructed by P-0 polynomials over primal meshes.
   We test the efficiency and robustness of this geometric scheme using
   some numerical examples. In particular, we do not see any volume locking
   and/or checkerboarding of pressure in our numerical examples. This
   suggests that our choice of discrete solution spaces is compatible. (C)

Title = {{Controlled transitory stall on a pitching airfoil using pulsed actuation}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Transitory separation control of a static and pitching 2-D airfoil is
   investigated in wind tunnel experiments using pulsed actuation on time
   scales that are an order of magnitude shorter than the characteristic
   convective time scale T-conv. Actuation is provided by momentary
   {[}O(0.05T(conv))] pulsed jets that are generated by a spanwise array of
   combustion-based actuators integrated in the center segment of the
   airfoil. The flow field in the center plane above the airfoil and in its
   near wake is computed from high-resolution PIV measurements in multiple
   overlapping cross-stream frames that are obtained phase-locked to the
   actuation and allow for tracking of vorticity concentrations. A single
   actuation pulse leads to a strong transitory increase in the circulation
   about the airfoil that is manifested by a partial collapse of the
   separated flow domain and is accompanied by the shedding of a
   large-scale clockwise vortex, and the attachment and accumulation of the
   surface vorticity layer behind it. The slow relaxation of the flow
   following termination of pulsed actuation returns the airfoil to full
   stall within 10T(conv). It is shown that repetition of actuation pulses
   within T-conv can increase the streamwise extent of the attached flow
   domain, and the trapped vorticity leads to a substantial increase in the
   peak transitory circulation before the flow separates again when the
   actuation is terminated. The coupling of the pulsed actuation to the
   airfoil's motion enhances the actuation's control authority. Single
   pulse can significantly increase the lift over most of the oscillation
   cycle both at post-stall and at angles of attack that are below stall.
   Several actuation pulses distributed during the pitch oscillation cycle
   can momentarily extend the accumulation of vorticity and thus increase
   the transitory and cycle-averaged lift, and improve the airfoil's pitch
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating the piezotronic effect in p-type piezoelectric
   semiconductor is critical for developing a complete piezotronic theory
   and designing/fabricating novel piezotronic applications with more
   complex functionality. Using a low temperature solution method, we were
   able to produce ultralong (up to 60 mu m in length) Sb doped p-type ZnO
   nanowires on both rigid and flexible substrates. For the p-type nanowire
   field effect transistor, the on/off ratio, threshold voltage, mobility,
   and carrier concentration of 0.2\% Sb-doped sample are found to be
   10(5), 2.1 V, 0.82 cm(2).V-1.s(-1), and 2.6 X 10(17) cm(-3),
   respectively, and the corresponding values for 1\% Sb doped samples are
   10(4), 2.0 V, 1.24 cm(2).V-1.s(-1), and 3.8 X 10(17) cm(-3). We further
   investigated the universality of piezotronic effect in the as
   synthesized Sb-doped p-type ZnO NWs and reported for the first time
   strain gated piezotronic transistors as well as piezopotential-driven
   mechanical energy harvesting based on solution grown p-type ZnO NWs. The
   results presented here broaden the scope of piezotronics and extend the
   framework for its potential applications in electronics,
   optoelectronics, smart MEMS/NEMS, and human-machine interfacing.}},

Abstract = {{By combining contact-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning
   Kevin probe microscopy (SKPM), we demonstrated an in situ method for
   quantitative characterization of the triboelectrification process at the
   nanoscale. We systematically characterized the charge distribution,
   multifriction effect on charge transfer, as well as subsequent charge
   diffusion on the dielectric surface: (i) the SiO2 surface can be either
   positively or negatively charged through triboelectric process using
   Si-based AFM probes with and without Pt coating, respectively; (ii) the
   triboelectric charges accumulated from multifriction and eventually
   reached to saturated concentrations of (-150 +/- 8) mu C/m(2) and (105
   +/- 6) mu/m(2), respectively; (iii) the charge diffusion coefficients on
   SiO2 surface were measured to be (1.10 +/- 0.03) x 10(-15) m(2)/s for
   the positive charge and (0.19 +/- 0.01) x 10(-15) m(2)/s for the
   negative charges. These quantifications will facilitate a fundamental
   understanding about the triboelectric and de-electrification process,
   which is important for designing high performance triboelectric
   nanogenerators. In addition, we demonstrated a technique for
   nanopatterning of surface charges without assistance of external
   electric field, which has a promising potential application for directed
   self-assembly of charged nanostructures for nanoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an innovative design of a disk triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG) with segmental structures for harvesting rotational mechanical
   energy. Based on a cyclic in-plane charge separation between the
   segments that have distinct triboelectric polarities, the disk TENG
   generates electricity with unique characteristics, which have been
   studied by conjunction of experimental results with finite element
   calculations. The role played by the segmentation number is studied for
   maximizing output. A distinct relationship between the rotation speed
   and the electrical output has been thoroughly investigated, which not
   only shows power enhancement at high speed but also illuminates its
   potential application as a self-powered angular speed sensor. Owing to
   the nonintermittent and ultrafast rotation-induced charge transfer, the
   disk TENG has been demonstrated as an efficient power source for
   instantaneously or even continuously driving electronic devices and/or
   charging an energy storage unit. This work presents a novel working mode
   of TENGs and opens up many potential applications of nanogenerators for
   harvesting even large-scale energy.}},

   400 degrees C, because of the greater k temperature sensitivity of the

   literature data for the individual phases, and the concentration of
   phases from microstructures, correctly predicted temperature and phase
   concentration dependencies, but were lower than experimental results.
   The k of pure ZrB2 and SiC as a function of temperature were

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a simple correlation-based strategy for
   estimating the unknown delay and amplitude of a signal based on a small
   number of noisy, randomly chosen frequency-domain samples. We model the
   output of this ``compressive matched filter{''} as a random process
   whose mean equals the scaled, shifted autocorrelation function of the
   template signal. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we
   prove that the expected maximum deviation of this process from its mean
   decreases sharply as the number of measurements increases, and we also
   derive a probabilistic tail bound on the maximum deviation. Putting all
   of this together, we bound the minimum number of measurements required
   to guarantee that the empirical maximum of this random process occurs
   sufficiently close to the true peak of its mean function. We conclude
   that for broad classes of signals, this compressive matched filter will
   successfully estimate the unknown delay (with high probability and
   within a prescribed tolerance) using a number of random frequency-domain
   samples that scales inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio and only
   logarithmically in the observation bandwidth and the possible range of
   delays.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital television broadcasting standards has resulted in
   transmission of perpetually on wireless digital-TV signals over the air
   at wider bandwidths in ultrahigh-frequency bands for high-definition

   exploits the unique makeup of ambient digital-TV signals, and scavenges
   wireless power from them at distance of over 6.3 km from the TV
   broadcast source. The harvested wireless power is successfully used to
   power and sustain a 16-bit embedded microcontroller for sensing and
   machine-to-machine applications without the use of batteries. The E-WEHP
   uses a miniaturized planar log-periodic antenna and RF-dc charge-pump
   circuit with maximum sensitivities of -14.6 and -18.86 dBm and an
   embedded firmware-based power management scheme to power microcontroller

Abstract = {{Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) technology effectively merges the desirable
   attributes of conventional silicon-based CMOS manufacturing (high
   integration levels, at high yield and low cost) with the extreme levels
   of transistor performance attainable in classical III-V heterojunction
   bipolar transistors (HBTs). SiGe technology joins together on-die
   high-speed bandgap-engineered SiGe HBTs with conventional Si CMOS to
   form SiGe BiCMOS technology, including all the requisite RF passive
   elements and multi-level thick-Al metalization required for high-speed
   circuit design. Such an silicon-based integrated circuit technology
   platform presents designers with an ideal division of labor for
   realizing optimal solutions to many performance-constrained mixed-signal
   (analog + digital + RF) systems. The unique bandgap-engineered features
   of SiGe HBTs enable several key merits with respect to operation across
   a wide variety of so-called ``extreme environments{''}, potentially with
   little or no process modification, ultimately providing compelling
   advantages at the circuit and system level, across a wide class of
   envisioned commercial and defense applications. Here we give an overview
   of this interesting field, focusing primarily on the intersection of
   SiGe HBTs, and circuits built from them, with radiation-intense

Abstract = {{Four-layer multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) thin films were deposited
   via dropcasting (1 mg/mL MWNTs and 10 mg/mL SDBS) onto filter papers
   that vary in pore size (1, 5, 25, and 40 mu m) to determine the effect
   of the underlying substrate structure on the in-plane properties of the
   films. The films (<100 nm thick) were dried using vacuum filtration, and
   drying in a 65 degrees C heater with and without a ceramic heating
   board. DC resistance of the films ranged from 6 x 10(3) to 9.3 x 10(9)
   Omega. Impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed a low and a high
   frequency inductive response and two parallel R-C circuits for the more
   conducting thin films. High resistance films were fit by a single RC
   circuit with a constant-phase element. The differences in the in-plane
   electrical responses of the different MWNT films can be explained by the
   degree of carbon nanotube surface coverage, obtained as a result of
   using different pore size filter papers. The drying method utilized also
   affected the CNT network formation and its resultant electrical
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{The study focuses on understanding the interfacial interactions between
   graphite nanoplatelets (GNP) and polyamide 12 (PA12) in GNP/PA12
   nanocomposites and the influence of GNP on the glass transition and
   crystallization of PA12. A complex constrained phase, consisting of
   immobilized amorphous and transcrystalline region, of PA12 at the GNP
   surface was determined. Strong correlation between the tensile modulus
   and the glass transition temperature and the amount of constrained
   phase, assessed through the thermo-mechanical and crystallization
   behavior of the composites, was found. The presence of the
   transcrystalline region was confirmed by the nucleating ability of the
   GNP. The complex constrained phase provides a secondary reinforcing
   mechanism. GNP reinforces PA12 not only because it is stronger but
   because it significantly alters locally the physical properties of the
   polymer. In conclusion, a strong link between the nano-scale interfacial
   interactions, the physical properties of the polymer and the bulk
   properties of the composites is highlighted and explained. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The reductive amination of ketones to produce chiral amines is an
   important transformation in the production of pharmaceutical
   intermediates. Therefore, industrially applicable enzymatic methods that
   enable the selective synthesis of chiral amines could be very useful.
   Using a phenylalanine dehydrogenase scaffold devoid of amine
   dehydrogenase activity, a robust amine dehydrogenase has been evolved
   with a single two-site library allowing for the direct production of
   (R)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-propyl-2-amine from para-fluorophenylacetone with
   a kcat value of 6.85s-1 and a KM value of 7.75mM for the ketone
   substrate. This is the first example of a highly active amine
   dehydrogenase capable of accepting aliphatic and benzylic ketone
   substrates. The stereoselectivity of the evolved amine dehydrogenase was
   very high (>99.8\% ee) showing that high selectivity of the wild-type
   phenylalanine dehydrogenase was conserved in the evolution process. When
   paired with glucose/glucose dehydrogenase, NADH cofactor can be
   effficiently regenerated and the reaction driven to over 93\%
   conversion. The broad specificity, high selectivity, and near complete
   conversion render this amine dehydrogenase an attractive target for
   further evolution toward pharmaceutical compounds and subsequent
   application.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to understand how exfoliated graphite
   nanoplatelets (xGnP) alter the elastic response of semi-crystalline
   polymers and reveal the mechanisms responsible for the property
   enhancement observed in graphite reinforced polymer nanocomposites. The
   nanocomposites were made by coating of polyamide 12 (PA12) powder with
   xGnP followed by melt compounding and injection molding. The mechanical
   properties, including tensile strength and modulus, flexural strength,
   and thermo-mechanical properties such as the glass transition
   temperature (T-g) and loss modulus of the xGnP/PA12 nanocomposites, were
   determined as a function of the xGnP content. It was found that xGnP
   acted as nucleating agent for PA12 and significantly altered the
   physical properties of the polymers including T-g and crystallization
   characteristics. Morphological studies indicated formation of xGnP
   agglomerates at xGnP content as low as 3wt.\%. A strong correlation
   between the T-g and the tensile modulus in xGnPPA12 was determined

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for injecting human inputs into
   mixed-initiative interactions between humans and robots. The method is
   based on a model-predictive control (MPC) formulation, which inevitably
   involves predicting the system (robot dynamics as well as human input)
   into the future. These predictions are complicated by the fact that the
   human is interacting with the robot, causing the prediction method
   itself to have an effect on future human inputs. We investigate and
   develop different prediction schemes, including fixed and variable
   horizon MPCs and human input estimators of different orders. Through a
   search-and-rescue-inspired human operator study, we arrive at the
   conclusion that the simplest prediction methods outperform the more
   complex ones, i.e., in this particular case, less is indeed more.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm for coupled-cluster through perturbative triples
   {[}CCSD(T)] based on a 4-dressed Hamiltonian and the use of density
   fitting (DF) or Cholesky decomposition (CD) approximations for the
   construction and ` contraction of all electron repulsion integrals
   (ERIs). An efficient implementation of this algorithm is then used to
   explore whether preoptimized density fitting basis sets {[}specifically,
   the (aug-)cc-pVXZ-RI series designed for DF-MP2 computations] are
   suitable for DF-CCSD(T) computations and how they compare to the CD
   representation of the integrals. The code is also used to systematically
   explore the accuracy and efficiency of DF/CD combined with frozen
   natural orbitals (FNOs) to reduce computational costs. The mean absolute
   errors due to DF/CD in the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energies of
   11 van der Waals dimers are only 0.001 kcal mol(-1) for the preoptimized
   RI basis set and only 0.002 and 0.001 kcal mol(-1) for CD with cutoffs
   of 10(-4) and 10(-5), respectively. The very similar performance of the
   aug-cc-pVDZ-RI auxiliary set is a bit surprising considering that the
   numbers of CD vectors using these thresholds are, on average, 28\% and
   7396 larger than the dimension of the RI set. When FNOs are coupled with
   DF/CD, the DF/CD error is roughly an order of magnitude less than the
   FNO truncation error (at a conservative FNO occupation cutoff of
   10(-5)). Utilizing t(1)-dressed three-index integrals, which remove the
   explicit dependence of the doubles residual equations on the
   t(1)-amplitudes, results in a moderate performance acceleration for the
   CCSD portion of the algorithm. Moreover, the t(1)-dressing results in a
   simpler code which will be more amenable to parallelization. Utilizing
   both CD and FNO techniques, we observe a speedup of four times for the
   evaluation of the three-body contribution to the interaction energy for
   the benzene trirner described by an aug-cc-pVDZ basis set; the error
   incurred by the CD and FNO approximations in the three-body contribution
   is only 0.002 kcal mol(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the superimposed oscillating load while using the
   continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique on the extracted
   indentation stress strain (ISS) curves were systematically investigated
   using spherical nanoindentation tests performed on a variety of samples,
   using probes of 1 and 100 mu m radii. Particular care was afforded to
   the corrections that were needed on the load, displacement and stiffness
   signals to account for the effect of the superimposed oscillations. A
   decrease in the oscillation frequency from the commonly used 45 Hz
   caused the measured stiffness values to decrease. This resulted in
   questionable high strain hardening values in the ISS curves. The noise
   levels in the recorded stiffness signal were significantly higher while
   using an oscillation amplitude of 1 nm. It was concluded that these
   observations are artifacts of the machine dynamic control systems and do
   not represent the material's true behavior. The CMS signal with a 45 Hz
   oscillation frequency and 2 nm amplitude appears to produce most
   reasonable values of stiffness values and is therefore the best choice
   for reliably extracting ISS curves for the materials studied. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In boron carbide (B4C), the loss of crystallinity (i.e. amorphization)
   during high-pressure loading is known to result in reduced hardness and
   inferior ballistic performance. In this investigation, a systematic
   procedure is developed to evaluate the size and shape of the amorphized
   zone as well as the spatial distribution of the amorphization intensity
   beneath a Vickers indentation. This is accomplished by successive
   metallographic polishing and material removal from the indented surface
   at submicron depth increments and then scanning of each surface using
   micro-Raman spectrometry to construct a three-dimensional map of the
   amorphized zone. The amorphized zone in B4C extends to a depth of almost
   seven times the indentation depth. The self-similarity in stress fields
   at various depths is also confirmed from quantitative description of the
   Raman peaks for various loads. Damage evolution in the form of a Mescall
   zone and initiation of radial cracking from the amorphized zone were
   also observed. It is inferred that the amorphization process initiates
   as soon as the indenter tip makes contact with the B4C surface and
   thereafter the indenter penetrates into the weakened amorphized
   material. The implications of this observation and the utility of the
   quantitative information on the size and shape of the measured
   amorphized zone for calibration of multiscale models on structural
   changes in B4C are discussed. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3923-3935}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Using combined Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical
   microscopy, this paper suggests that breakaway oxidation of Zircaloy is
   caused by the change of circumferential stress sign from compressive to
   tensile, which triggers catastrophic cracks to propagate from the oxide
   free surface toward the oxide-metal interface. The stress sign changes
   at a critical oxide thickness, which depends on the circumferential
   stress at the interface. This biaxial interfacial stress is promoted by
   a lattice expansion stress that accompanies the tetragonal to monoclinic
   crystal phase transition. In contrast with current research in the
   literature, this allotropic transformation is suggested to be
   beneficial, not detrimental, because it contributes to retard the
   thresholds for the change of circumferential stress sign, and thus
   breakaway oxidation. The tetragonal phase was revealed to localize at
   the interface and adopt the shape of prismatic isosceles triangles
   detected at early stages of oxidation. These growth morphologies are
   consistent with a cationic oxidation mechanism. Upon phase transition,
   the monoclinic variant quickly dominates the oxide scale above the
   interfacial regions and forces the overall oxidation to proceed by an
   anionic diffusion mechanism. The results of Raman spectroscopy compared
   well with those of atomic force microscopy. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{We present a design methodology for an overlapping hexagonal planar
   spiral coil (hex-PSC) array, optimized for creation of a homogenous
   magnetic field for wireless power transmission to randomly moving
   objects. The modular hex-PSC array has been implemented in the form of
   three parallel conductive layers, for which an iterative optimization
   procedure defines the PSC geometries. Since the overlapping hex-PSCs in
   different layers have different characteristics, the worst case
   coil-coupling condition should be designed to provide the maximum power
   transfer efficiency (PTE) in order to minimize the spatial received
   power fluctuations. In the worst case, the transmitter (Tx) hex-PSC is
   overlapped by six PSCs and surrounded by six other adjacent PSCs. Using
   a receiver (Rx) coil, 20 mm in radius, at the coupling distance of 78 mm
   and maximum lateral misalignment of 49.1 mm (1/root 3 of the PSC radius)
   we can receive power at a PTE of 19.6\% from the worst case PSC.
   Furthermore, we have studied the effects of Rx coil tilting and
   concluded that the PTE degrades significantly when theta > 60 degrees
   Solutions are: 1) activating two adjacent overlapping hex-PSCs
   simultaneously with out-of-phase excitations to create horizontal
   magnetic flux and 2) inclusion of a small energy storage element in the
   Rx module to maintain power in the worst case scenarios. In order to
   verify the proposed design methodology, we have developed the EnerCage
   system, which aims to power up biological instruments attached to or
   implanted in freely behaving small animal subjects' bodies in long-term
   electrophysiology experiments within large experimental arenas.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the distribution of the considerable heat generated in the
   active region of high power AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
   (HEMTs) at the sub-micron length scales relevant to the failures being
   observed in these devices is crucial for understanding device
   performance and reliability. In addition, electrical bias conditions and
   structural characteristics such as field plates alter the electric field
   distribution and thermal path within the device leading to changes in
   the heat generation profile across the channel. This in turn influences
   the value and location of the device peak temperature and the channel to
   ambient (or case or base-plate) thermal resistance. The channel
   temperature distribution of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures with and without
   source connected field plates were examined via micro-Raman spectroscopy
   and coupled electro-thermal simulation. For both type of structures,
   high V-ds conditions lead to significantly higher channel temperature
   compared to that for low V-ds conditions for the same power dissipation
   level. This is important because the industry standard Arrhenius
   relation assumes the total power is sufficient to describe the device
   channel temperature and that the bias condition is irrelevant {[}1]. We
   explore the level of agreement between modeling and experiment, and also
   the extent to which variability in input parameters for the modeling
   affects model results. We show that operating bias condition has a
   significant role in device reliability by altering value and location of
   the peak temperature, which then alters the type and rate of thermally
   induced degradation taking place at critical locations such as the drain
   side corner of the gate. Specifically, care must be taken when
   extrapolating results of an accelerated life test to usage conditions at
   dissimilar bias conditions to consider if the results will be
   applicable. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   dual-responsive polystyrene (PS) microbeads with controlled sizes via
   dispersion polymerization is described. Three different luminophors are
   selected and directly introduced into the reaction system and thus

   manipulating the reaction conditions, including concentrations of the
   initiator and monomer, polarity of the reaction medium, and injection
   rate for the monomer, uniform PS microbeads with sizes ranging from 1 to
   5 m are obtained. When a light source centered at 365 nm is used to
   excite all the luminophors in the PS beads, three distinct and
   resolvable emission peaks corresponding well with the luminophors are
   observed. By taking advantage of their sensitive responses to both
   pressure and temperature, the PS beads can be utilized for quantitative
   measurements of these two stimulations simultaneously. The PS beads
   loaded with multiple luminophors have the ability to serve as building

Abstract = {{This study was conceived to evaluate the global scientific output of
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) research over the past 20 years and to
   assess the characteristics of the research patterns, tendencies, and
   methods in the papers. Data were based on the online version of Science
   Citation Index Expanded from 1992 to 2011. Publications referring to
   SOAs were assessed by distribution of the number of publications and
   times cited, source categories, source journals, author keywords, Key
   Words Plus, and the most cited publications in these years. By synthetic
   analysis of author keywords, Key Words Plus, titles, and abstracts, it
   was concluded that modeling is currently and will at least over the next
   decade continue to be the predominant research method to validate
   state-of-the-art knowledge of SOAs, and that the foci of SOA research
   will be the key precursors terpenes and isoprene, the mechanisms of
   oxidation and gas-phase reactions, and emission inventories.}},

Abstract = {{On 11 March 2011, a moment magnitude M (w) = 9.0 earthquake occurred off
   the Japan Tohoku coast causing catastrophic damage and loss of human
   lives. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, we conducted the
   reconnaissance survey in the city of Rikuzentakata, Japan. In comparison
   with three previous historical tsunamis impacting the same region, the
   2011 event presented the largest values with respect to the tsunami
   height, the inundation area and the inundation distance. A
   representative tsunami height of 15 m was recorded in Rikuzentakata,
   with increased heights of 20 m around rocky headlands. In terms of the
   inundation area, the 2011 Tohoku tsunami exceeded by almost 2.6 times
   the area flooded by the 1960 Chilean tsunami, which ranks second among
   the four events compared. The maximum tsunami inundation distance was
   8.1 km along the Kesen River, exceeding the 1933 Showa and 1960 Chilean
   tsunami inundations by factors of 6.2 and 2.7, respectively. The
   overland tsunami inundation distance was less than 2 km. The tsunami
   inundation height linearly decreased along the Kesen River at a rate of
   approximately 1 m/km. Nevertheless, the measured inland tsunami heights
   exhibit significant variations on local and regional scales. A
   designated ``tsunami control forest{''} planted with a cross-shore width
   of about 200 m along a 2 km stretch of Rikuzentakata coastline was
   completely overrun and failed to protect the local community during this
   extreme event. Similarly, many designated tsunami shelters were too low
   and were overwashed by tsunami waves, thereby failing to provide shelter
   for evacuees-a risk that had been underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Cell encapsulation in hydrogels is widely used in tissue engineering
   applications, including encapsulation of islets or other
   insulin-secreting cells in pancreatic substitutes. Use of adhesive,
   biofunctionalized hydrogels is receiving increasing attention as
   cell-matrix interactions in three-dimensional (3-D) environments can be
   important for various cell processes. With pancreatic substitutes,
   studies have indicated benefits of 3-D adhesion on the viability and/or
   function of insulin-secreting cells. As long-term storage of
   microencapsulated cells is critical for their clinical translation,
   cryopreservation of cells in hydrogels is being actively investigated.
   Previous studies have examined the cryopreservation response of cells
   encapsulated in non-adhesive hydrogels using conventional freezing
   and/or vitrification (ice-free cryopreservation); however, none have
   systematically compared the two cryopreservation methods with cells
   encapsulated within an adhesive 3-D environment. The latter would be
   significant, as evidence suggests adhesion influences the cellular
   response to cryopreservation. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   determine the response to conventional freezing and vitrification of
   insulin-secreting cells encapsulated in an adhesive biomimetic hydrogel.
   Recombinant insulin-secreting C2C12 myoblasts were encapsulated in
   oxidized RGD-alginate and cultured for 1 or 4 days post-encapsulation,
   cryopreserved, and assessed up to 3 days post-warming for metabolic
   activity and insulin secretion, and 1 day post-warming for cell
   morphology. Besides certain transient differences in the vitrified group
   relative to the fresh control, both conventional freezing and
   vitrification maintained the metabolism, secretory activity, and
   morphology of the recombinant C2C12 cells. Thus, due to a simpler
   procedure and slightly superior results, conventional freezing is
   recommended over vitrification for the cryopreservation of C2C12 cells
   encapsulated in oxidized, RGD-modified alginate. (C) 2013 Acta

Abstract = {{Outcomes after tendon repair are often unsatisfactory, despite
   improvements in surgical techniques and rehabilitation methods. Recent
   studies aimed at enhancing repair have targeted the paucicellular nature
   of tendon for enhancing repair; however, most approaches for delivering
   growth factors and cells have not been designed for dense connective
   tissues such as tendon. Therefore, we developed a scaffold capable of
   delivering growth factors and cells in a surgically manageable form for
   tendon repair. Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), along with
   adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), were incorporated into a
   heparin/fibrin-based delivery system (HBDS). This hydrogel was then
   layered with an electrospun nanofiber poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
   (PLGA) backbone. The HBDS allowed for the concurrent delivery of PDGF-BB
   and ASCs in a controlled manner, while the PLGA backbone provided
   structural integrity for surgical handling and tendon implantation. In
   vitro studies verified that the cells remained viable, and that
   sustained growth factor release was achieved. In vivo studies in a large
   animal tendon model verified that the approach was clinically relevant,
   and that the cells remained viable in the tendon repair environment.
   Only a mild immunoresponse was seen at dissection, histologically, and
   at the mRNA level; fiuorescently labeled ASCs and the scaffold were
   found at the repair site 9 days post-operatively; and increased total
   DNA was observed in ASC-treated tendons. The novel layered scaffold has
   the potential for improving tendon healing due to its ability to deliver
   both cells and growth factors simultaneously in a surgically convenient
   manner. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In color flow imaging, it is a challenging work to accurately extract
   blood flow information from ultrasound Doppler echoes dominated by the
   strong clutter components. In this paper, we provide an in-depth
   analysis of ridge ensemble empirical mode decomposition (R-EEMD) and
   compare it with the conventional empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
   framework. R-EEMD facilitates nonuniform and trial-dependent weights
   obtained by an optimization procedure during ensemble combination and
   results in less decomposition errors when compared with the conventional
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition techniques. A theoretic result is
   then extended to demonstrate that R-EEMD has an ability to solve the
   mode mixing problem frequently encountered in EMD and improve the
   decomposition performance with adequate noise strength when separating a
   composite two-tone signal. Based on the proposed R-EEMD framework, a
   novel clutter rejection filter for ultrasound color flow imaging is
   designed. In a series of simulations, the R-EEMD-based filter achieves a
   significant improvement on blood flow velocity estimation over the
   state-of-the-art regression filters and decomposition-based filters,
   such as eigen-based and EMD filters. An experiment on human carotid
   artery data also verifies that the R-EEMD algorithm achieves minimum
   clutter energy and maximum blood-to-clutter energy ratio among all the
   tested techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing can be used to produce structures which would be
   impossible to manufacture using traditional manufacturing processes. One
   application of this technology is for fabrication of customized,
   light-weight material called meso-scale lattice structure (MSLS), which
   is a type of cellular structure with dimensions in the range of 0.1 to
   10 mm. The problem to be addressed in this paper is how to efficiently
   synthesize MSLS with thousands of struts and, hence, thousands of design
   variables. A heuristic optimization method is presented for efficiently
   synthesizing large MSLS on complex shaped parts that reduces the
   multivariate optimization problem to a problem of only two variables.
   The heuristic is based on the observation that the stress distribution
   in a MSLS will be similar to the stress distribution in a solid body of
   the same overall shape. Based on local stress states, unit cells from a
   predefined unit-cell library are selected and sized to support those
   stress states. In this paper, the method is applied to design a strong,
   stiff and light-weight Micro Air Vehicle fuselage. Weight savings are
   demonstrated as a result.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible
   silicon-embedding techniques for on-chip integration of
   microelectromechanical-system devices with 3-D complex structures. By
   taking advantage of the ``dead volume{''} within the bulk of the silicon
   wafer, functional devices with large profile can be embedded into the
   substrate without consuming valuable die area on the wafer surface or
   increasing the packaging complexity. Furthermore, through-wafer
   interconnects can be implemented to connect the device to the circuitry
   on the wafer surface. The key challenge of embedding structures within
   the wafer volume is processing inside deep trenches. To achieve this
   goal in an area-efficient manner, straight-sidewall trenches are
   desired, adding additional difficulty to the embedding process. Two
   approaches to achieve this goal are presented in this paper, i.e., a
   lithography-based process and a shadow-mask-based process. The
   lithography-based process utilizes a spray-coating technique and
   proximity lithography in combination with thick epoxy processing and
   laminated dry-film lithography. The shadow-mask-based process employs a
   specially designed 3-D silicon shadow mask to enable simultaneous metal
   patterning on both the vertical sidewall and the bottom surface of the
   trench during deposition, eliminating multiple lithography steps and
   reducing the process time. Both techniques have been demonstrated
   through the embedding of the topologically complex 3-D toroidal
   inductors into the silicon substrate for power supply on-chip (PwrSoC)
   applications. Embedded 3-D inductors that possess 25 turns and a
   diameter of 6 mm in a silicon trench of 300-mu m depth achieve overall
   inductances of 45-60 nH, dc resistances of 290-400 m Omega, and quality
   factors of 16-17.5 at 40-70 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{He atom trapping in hetero-interphase materials is studied by atomistic
   simulations, focusing on the KSI and KSmin interfaces in Cu-Nb. If the
   bulk crystalline materials are defect free, single He atoms eventually
   become absorbed into the interfacial region via one of two different
   processes. In the first process, all He atoms arriving at the interface
   from the Cu side of the interface and some He atoms arriving from the Nb
   side, are trapped via the formation of a helium-vacancy (Hey) cluster in
   the second or third interfacial planes of the copper crystal. The
   immobile HeV cluster is found to be stable against dissociation and
   recombination. In the second case the He atoms are absorbed as
   interstitial atoms in one of the terminal planes. This process is
   dependent on the interstitial content of the interface and is found to
   be weak in the case of the KSI interface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Colloidal nanocrystals exhibit a wide range of size-and shape-dependent
   properties and have found application in myriad fields, incuding optics,
   electronics, mechanics, drug delivery and catalysis, to name but a
   few(1-3). Synthetic protocols that enable the simple and convenient
   production of colloidal nanocrystals with controlled size, shape and
   composition are therefore of key general importance(4,5). Current
   strategies include organic solution-phase synthesis(6), thermolysis of
   organometallic precursors(4,7), sol-gel processes(5), hydrothermal
   reactions(8) and biomimetic and dendrimer templating(9-11). Often,
   however, these procedures require stringent experimental conditions, are
   difficult to generalize, or necessitate tedious multistep reactions and
   purification. Recently, linear amphiphilic block co-polymer micelles
   have been used as templates to synthesize functional
   nanocrystals(12,13), but the thermodynamic instability of these micelles
   limits the scope of this approach. Here, we report a general strategy
   for crafting a large variety of functional nanocrystals with precisely
   controlled dimensions, compositions and architectures by using star-like
   block copolymers as nanoreactors. This new class of co-polymers forms
   unimolecular micelles that are structurally stable, therefore overcoming
   the intrinsic instability of linear block co-polymer micelles. Our
   approach enables the facile synthesis of organic solvent-and
   water-soluble nearly monodisperse nanocrystals with desired composition
   and architecture, including core-shell and hollow nanostructures. We
   demonstrate the generality of our approach by describing, as examples,
   the synthesis of various sizes and architectures of metallic,
   ferroelectric, magnetic, semiconductor and luminescent colloidal
   nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with multiple
   underlying metabolic and physical risk factors. Bone morphogenic protein
   4 (BMP4) expression is increased in endothelium in atherosclerosis-prone
   regions and is known to induce endothelial inflammation, endothelial
   dysfunction, and hypertension. BMP actions are mediated by 2 different
   types of BMP receptors (BMPRI and BMPRII). Here, we show a surprising
   finding that loss of BMPRII expression causes endothelial inflammation
   and atherosclerosis.
   Approach and Results-Using BMPRII siRNA and BMPRII+/- mice, we found
   that specific knockdown of BMPRII, but not other BMP receptors (Alk1,
   Alk2, Alk3, Alk6, ActRIIa, and ActRIIb), induced endothelial
   inflammation in a ligand-independent manner by mechanisms mediated by
   reactive oxygen species, nuclear factor-KappaB, and reduced nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases. Further, BMPRII+/- ApoE(-/-)
   mice developed accelerated atherosclerosis compared with BMPRII+/+
   ApoE(-/-) mice. Interestingly, we found that multiple proatherogenic
   stimuli, such as hypercholesterolemia, disturbed flow, prohypertensive
   angiotensin II, and the proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha), downregulated BMPRII expression in endothelium, whereas
   antiatherogenic stimuli, such as stable flow and statin treatment,
   upregulated its expression in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, BMPRII
   expression was significantly diminished in human coronary advanced
   atherosclerotic lesions. Also, we were able to rescue the endothelial
   inflammation induced by BMPRII knockdown by overexpressing the BMPRII
   wild type, but not by the BMPRII short form lacking the
   carboxyl-terminal tail region.
   Conclusions-These results suggest that BMPRII is a critical,
   anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic protein that is commonly targeted
   by multiple pro-and antiatherogenic factors. BMPRII may be used as a
   novel diagnostic and therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Although the cortical substrates of verbal working memory are reasonably
   well understood, less is known about the relative contribution of
   subcortical structures to verbal working memory. Therefore, in addition
   to elaboration of a model of verbal working memory by including a
   specific focus on basal ganglia, the purpose of this study also was to
   examine potential differences in neural function across the complete
   process of verbal working memory, from encoding through retrieval.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to observe regions of
   brain activation in neurologically normal participants during a task of
   verbal working memory. The expected frontal-parietal network was found
   to be active over the course of the verbal working memory task. The
   encoding portion of the task engaged left inferior frontal regions and
   bilateral caudate and thalamus. Bilateral medial thalamus and posterior
   cingulate regions were engaged during the maintenance phase of the task.
   Retrieval activated the left inferior frontal sulcus and posterior
   parietal/occipital regions. Findings are considered in light of current
   models of verbal working memory and subcortical structures. Published by

Abstract = {{Electrochemical cells (ECs) are devices that convert chemical energy
   into electricity through spontaneous oxidation-reduction reactions that
   occur separately at two electrodes through the transport of protons in
   the electrolyte solution and the flow of electrons in the external
   circuit. A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an effective device
   that converts mechanical energy into electricity using organic/polymer
   materials by a contact induced electrification process followed by
   charge separation. In this paper, we demonstrate the first integration
   of an EC and a TENG for simultaneously harvesting chemical and
   mechanical energy, and its application for powering a sensor and even
   personal electronics. An EC was fabricated using a Cu/NaCl solution/Al
   structure, on which a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with a
   micropyramid surface structure was used as the protection layer of the
   EC for anti-corrosion, anti-contamination and anti-mechanical damage. A
   TENG was fabricated based on a contact-and-separation process between
   the PDMS protection layer and the Al electrode layer of the EC. The
   output performance of the TENG can be increased by embedding BaTiO3
   nanoparticles into the PDMS film layer to enhance the dielectric
   property. Moreover, we also demonstrated that the produced hybrid
   energies can be stored in a Li-ion battery for lighting up 30 green
   LEDs.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based functional electronic devices endow a new era of
   applications in radio-frequency identification (RFID), sensors,
   transistors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). As an important
   component for building an all paper-based system that can work
   independently and sustainably, a paper-based power source is
   indispensable. In this study, we demonstrated a paper-based
   nanogenerator (pNG) that can convert tiny-scale mechanical energy into
   electricity. The pNG relies on an electrostatic effect, and the
   electrostatic charges on the paper were generated by the corona method.
   The instantaneous output power density of a single-layered pNG reached
   similar to 90.6 mW cm(-2) at a voltage of 110 V, and this
   instantaneously illuminated 70 LEDs. In addition, by sticking the pNG to
   a movable object, such as the page of a book, the power harvested from
   the mechanical action of turning the page can drive an LED, which
   presents its outstanding potential in building paper-based, self-powered
   systems and as active sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a fully integrated active voltage doubler in
   CMOS technology using offset-controlled high speed comparators for
   extending the range of inductive power transmission to implantable
   microelectronic devices (IMD) and radio-frequency identification (RFID)
   tags. This active voltage doubler provides considerably higher power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) and lower dropout voltage compared to its
   passive counterpart and requires lower input voltage than active
   rectifiers, leading to reliable and efficient operation with weakly
   coupled inductive links. The offset-controlled functions in the
   comparators compensate for turn-on and turn-off delays to not only
   maximize the forward charging current to the load but also minimize the
   back current, optimizing PCE in the high frequency (HF) band. We
   fabricated the active voltage doubler in a 0.5-mu m 3M2P std. CMOS
   process, occupying 0.144 mm(2) of chip area. With 1.46 V peak AC input
   at 13.56 MHz, the active voltage doubler provides 2.4 V DC output across
   a 1 k Omega load, achieving the highest PCE = 79\% ever reported at this
   frequency. In addition, the built-in start-up circuit ensures a reliable
   operation at lower voltages.}},

Abstract = {{Satisfying diverse customer needs leads to proliferation of product
   variants. It is imperative to model the coherence of functional, product

   variety management decisions, the SysML-based information models are
   further implemented as a variety coding information system. A case study
   of switchgear enclosure production reconfiguration system demonstrates
   that SysML-based information modeling excels in conducting requirements,
   structural, behavioral and constraints analysis and in performing
   trade-off study. In addition, it maintains semantic coherence along the
   design chain, keeps traceability across different levels of abstraction,

Abstract = {{Design chain management requires many decision makers throughout the
   product development process. It is critical to reduce complexity and
   uncertainty of the design process by correctly modeling subjective data
   associated with decision makers' preferences. This paper aims at using
   decision support to find optimal designs by modeling respondent
   preferences and trade-offs with consideration of uncertainty.
   Specifically, a simulation-based ranking methodology is implemented and
   incorporated with traditional conjoint analysis. This process
   facilitates a schematic decision support process by alleviating user
   fatigue. In addition, incorporation of uncertainty in the ranking
   process provides the capability of producing robust and reliable

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Railyards have the potential to influence local fine particulate matter
   (aerodynamic diameter 2.5 mu m; PM2.5) concentrations through emissions
   from diesel locomotives and supporting activities. This is of concern in
   urban regions where railyards are in proximity to residential areas.
   Northwest of Atlanta, Georgia, Inman and Tilford railyards are located
   beside residential neighborhoods, industries, and schools. The PM2.5
   concentrations near the railyards is the highest measured amongst the
   state-run monitoring sites (Georgia Environmental Protection Division,
   2012). http:// www. georgiaair.org/amp/report.php). The authors
   estimated fuel-based black carbon (BC) and PM2.5 emission factors for
   these railyards in order to help determine the impact of railyard
   activities on PM2.5 concentrations, and for assessing the potential
   benefits of replacing current locomotive engines with cleaner
   technologies. High-time-resolution measurements of BC, PM2.5, CO2, and
   wind speed and direction were made at two locations, north and south of
   the railyards. Emissions factors (i.e., the mass of BC or PM2.5 per
   gallon of fuel burned) were estimated by using the downwind/upwind
   difference in concentrations, wavelet analysis, and an event-based
   approach. By the authors' estimates, diesel-electric engines used in the
   railyards have average emission factors of 2.8 +/- 0.2 g of BC and 6.0
   +/- 0.5 g of PM2.5 per gallon of diesel fuel burned. A broader mix of
   railyard supporting activities appear to lead to average emission
   factors of 0.7 +/- 0.03 g of BC and 1.5 +/- 0.1 g of PM2.5 per gallon of
   diesel fuel burned. Railyard emissions appear to lead to average
   enhancements of approximately 1.7 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) of PM2.5 and
   approximately 0.8 +/- 0.01 mu g/m(3) of BC in neighboring areas on an
   annual average basis. Uncertainty not quantified in these results could
   arise mainly from variability in downwind/upwind differences,
   differences in emissions of the diverse zones within the railyards, and
   the influence of on-road mobile source emissions. Implications: In-use
   fuel-based black carbon and fine particulate emission factors for
   railyard activities were quantified by novel approaches using
   near-source high-time-resolution monitoring of ambient concentrations at
   two sites. Results can reduce the uncertainty in railyard emission
   inventories and the approach can be replicated and extended to assess
   trends and evaluate emission reduction alternatives. Supplemental
   Materials: Supplemental materials are available for this paper. Go to

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Unstructured three-dimensional fluid velocity data were interpolated
   using Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Data were
   generated to imitate the spatial resolution and experimental uncertainty
   of a typical implementation of defocusing digital particle image
   velocimetry. The velocity field associated with a steadily rotating
   infinite plate was simulated to provide a bounded, fully
   three-dimensional analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations,
   allowing for robust analysis of the interpolation accuracy. The spatial
   resolution of the data (i.e. particle density) and the number of RBFs
   were varied in order to assess the requirements for accurate
   interpolation. Interpolation constraints, including boundary conditions
   and continuity, were included in the error metric used for the
   least-squares minimization that determines the interpolation parameters
   to explore methods for improving RBF interpolation results. Even spacing
   and logarithmic spacing of RBF locations were also investigated.
   Interpolation accuracy was assessed using the velocity field, divergence
   of the velocity field, and viscous torque on the rotating boundary. The
   results suggest that for the present implementation, RBF spacing of 0.28
   times the boundary layer thickness is sufficient for accurate
   interpolation, though theoretical error analysis suggests that improved
   RBF positioning may yield more accurate results. All RBF interpolation
   results were compared to standard Gaussian weighting and Taylor
   expansion interpolation methods. Results showed that RBF interpolation
   improves interpolation results compared to the Taylor expansion method
   by 60\% to 90\% based on the average squared velocity error and provides
   comparable velocity results to Gaussian weighted interpolation in terms
   of velocity error. RMS accuracy of the flow field divergence was one to
   two orders of magnitude better for the RBF interpolation compared to the
   other two methods. RBF interpolation that was applied to vortex
   identification in experimental data showed reduced noise and reliable
   calculation of vortex ring geometry.}},

Abstract = {{This work extends our research on motion coordination of free-range
   vehicular systems based on concepts and results borrowed from resource
   allocation systems (RAS) theory, to vehicular systems with limited
   communication range among the vehicles. Similar to the earlier work, the
   employed model assumes the tessellation of the motion plane into cells,
   which are allocated to the traveling vehicles in a controlled manner
   that ensures collision-free and live motion. On the other hand, the
   limited communication range of the vehicles implies that full
   synchronization of their access to the considered cells is not possible
   any more, and yields new challenges for the deployed supervisory control
   policies. To enable the development of supervisory policies capable of
   providing the necessary partial synchronization of the cell allocation,
   we modify the structure of the adopted tessellation by allowing the
   concurrent occupation of a cell by up to two vehicles at a time, instead
   of only one, that was assumed earlier. This modification renders
   polynomially computable the relevant maximally permissive cell
   allocation policy, and it enables the implementation of this policy in
   the form of a distributed protocol that is feasible in the context of
   the communication constraints that are considered in this work. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The determinants and key mechanisms of cancer cell osteotropism have not
   been identified, mainly due to the lack of reproducible animal models
   representing the biological, genetic and clinical features seen in
   humans. An ideal model should be capable of recapitulating as many steps
   of the metastatic cascade as possible, thus facilitating the development
   of prognostic markers and novel therapeutic strategies. Most animal
   models of bone metastasis still have to be derived experimentally as
   most syngeneic and transgeneic approaches do not provide a robust
   skeletal phenotype and do not recapitulate the biological processes seen
   in humans. The xenotransplantation of human cancer cells or tumour
   tissue into immunocompromised murine hosts provides the possibility to
   simulate early and late stages of the human disease. Human bone or
   tissue-engineered human bone constructs can be implanted into the animal
   to recapitulate more subtle, species-specific aspects of the mutual
   interaction between human cancer cells and the human bone
   microenvironment. Moreover, the replication of the entire ``organ{''}
   bone makes it possible to analyse the interaction between cancer cells
   and the haematopoietic niche and to confer at least a partial human
   immunity to the murine host. This process of humanisation is facilitated
   by novel immunocompromised mouse strains that allow a high engraftment
   rate of human cells or tissue. These humanised xenograft models provide
   an important research tool to study human biological processes of bone
   metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor phase growth of gold, nickel and titanium metal nanoparticles on
   multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) buckypaper by sputtering was
   investigated. The size and distribution of nanoparticles was dependent
   on the intrinsic binding energy of the metal elements, but could be
   altered to mimic that of metals with different binding energies by in
   situ modification of the MWCNT surfaces by energetic metal ions or
   annealing of the buckypaper. A range of average gold particle diameters
   from approximately 5-30 nm could be produced depending on the intrinsic
   sputter process parameters (especially metal ion flux and kinetic
   energy) and defect density of the MWCNT surfaces, which could also be
   controlled by annealing prior to sputtering. The diameter of the MWCNTs
   had a significant influence on the geometry of the nanoparticles.
   Particles were elongated along the nanotube axis for tube diameters <30
   nm. Remarkably strong alignment of the particles along the nanotube axis
   was observed, especially for MWCNTs with higher defect densities. (C)

   underestimated by nearly 50\% using H-UPD on conventional
   (non-shape-controlled) PtNi/C. In addition to the effect from Ni, the
   shape/structure of the nanoparticles also made the calculation more
   complicated. The surface area could be underestimated by more than two
   times using H-UPD on octahedral PtNi/C compared to using Cu-UPD. Cu-UPD
   was demonstrated to be a more accurate method to estimate the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the impact of through-silicon-via (TSV) and
   shallow trench isolation (STI) stress on the timing variations of 3-D
   IC. We also propose the first systematic TSV-STI-stress-aware timing
   analysis and show how to optimize layouts for better performance. First,
   we generate a stress contour map with an analytical radial stress model
   for TSV. We also develop a stress model for STI from finite element
   analysis results. Then, depending on geometric relation between TSVs,
   STI, and transistors, the tensile and compressive stresses are converted
   to hole and electron mobility variations. Mobility-variation-aware cell
   library and netlist are generated and incorporated into an industrial
   engine for timing analysis of 3-D IC. We observe that TSV stress and STI
   stress interact with each other, and rise and fall time react
   differently to stress and relative locations with respect to both TSVs
   and STIs. Overall, TSV-STI-stress-induced timing variations can be as
   much as +/- 15\% at the cell level. Thus, as an application to layout
   optimization, we exploit the stress-induced mobility enhancement to
   improve performance of 3-D ICs. We show that stress-aware layout
   perturbation could reduce cell delay by up to 23.37\% and critical path
   delay by 6.67\% in our test case.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we utilize micro-Raman spectroscopy to measure
   temperature and stress in state-of-the-art AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. A rigorous
   discussion on the physical accuracy, precision, and precautions for
   diverse Raman thermometry methods is developed. Thermometry techniques
   utilizing shifts in a single Raman Stokes peak position underpredict the
   channel temperature due to induction of operational thermoelastic stress
   in operating devices. Utilizing the change in phonon linewidth by
   employing a proper reference condition gives true temperature results.
   Making use of frequency shifts in both the E-2(high) and A(1)(LO) phonon
   modes offers accurate and time-efficient means to determine the state of
   temperature and thermal stress in operating AlGaN/GaN HEMTs presuming
   that linear relations between phonon frequencies and temperature/stress
   are well determined. Useful applications of this method such as
   monitoring stress in GaN wafers between fabrication steps and Raman
   thermography on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{this paper, we consider the use of cooperative transmissions in multihop
   wireless networks to achieve Virtual Multiple Input Single Output
   (VMISO) links. Specifically, we investigate how the physical layer VMISO
   benefits translate into network level performance improvements. We show
   that the improvements are nontrivial (15 to 300 percent depending on the
   node density) but rely on two crucial algorithmic decisions: the number
   of cooperating transmitters for each link; and the cooperation strategy
   used by the transmitters. We explore the tradeoffs in making routing
   decisions using analytical models and derive the key routing
   considerations. Finally, we present Proteus, an adaptive diversity
   routing protocol that includes algorithmic solutions to the above two
   decision problems and leverages VMISO links in multihop wireless network
   to achieve performance improvements. We evaluate Proteus using NS2-based
   simulations with an enhanced physical layer model that accurately
   captures the effect of VMISO transmissions.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms leading to colonization of metastatic breast cancer cells
   (BCa) in the skeleton are still not fully understood. Here, we
   demonstrate that mineralized extracellular matrices secreted by primary
   human osteoblasts (hOBM) modulate cellular processes associated with BCa
   colonization of bone. A panel of four BCa cell lines of different
   bone-metastatic potential (T47D, SUM1315, MDA-MB-231, and the
   bone-seeking subline MDA-MB-231BO) was cultured on hOBM. After 3 days,
   the metastatic BCa cells had undergone morphological changes on hOBM and
   were aligned along the hOBM's collagen type I fibrils that were
   decorated with bone-specific proteins. In contrast, nonmetastatic BCa
   cells showed a random orientation on hOBM. Atomic force microscopy-based
   single-cell force spectroscopy revealed that the metastatic cell lines
   adhered more strongly to hOBM compared with nonmetastatic cells.
   Function-blocking experiments indicated that 1-integrins mediated cell
   adhesion to hOBM. In addition, metastatic BCa cells migrated
   directionally and invaded hOBM, which was accompanied by enhanced MMP-2
   and -9 secretion. Furthermore, we observed gene expression changes
   associated with osteomimickry in BCa cultured on hOBM. As such,
   osteopontin mRNA levels were significantly increased in SUM1315 and
   MDA-MB-231BO cells in a 1-integrindependent manner after growing for 3
   days on hOBM compared with tissue culture plastic. In conclusion, our
   results show that extracellular matrices derived from human osteoblasts
   represent a powerful experimental platform to dissect mechanisms
   underlying critical steps in the development of bone metastases.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to explore the potential use of
   Fe40Ni60/Polyamide 6 (PA6) nanocomposites in engineering applications by
   providing understanding of how the nanocrystalline (nc) metallic
   particles are altering physical properties of the polymer and the
   corresponding reinforcing mechanisms. This is the first study using nc
   Fe-Ni alloy, which has unique various properties, as a filler for
   polymers. nc Fe40Ni60 particles were chemically synthesized. The
   composites with various nanofiller loadings were made by compounding the
   materials, either by melt mixing (MM) or via solution mixing (SM), and
   injection molding. The results show that SM composites have remarkable
   mechanical and thermomechanical properties, but MM ones exhibit
   deteriorated properties. In addition, morphological and crystalline
   structure analyses indicate that there is good interfacial interaction
   between nanofiller and polymer only in SM composites. This is because
   the ferromagnetism of Fe-Ni alloy could be only overcome by intensive
   compounding. It is concluded that there are four competing factors
   determining the overall performance of SM composites: i) degree of
   agglomeration and particle distribution within PA6 matrix and physical
   structural changes that occurred in PA6 due to presence of alloy
   particles including ii) crystallinity; iii) ratio of gamma-form to
   alpha-form crystals; and iv) Glass transition temperature (Tg) of PA6.
   Overall, compared to other conventional nanoreinforcements for PA6, nc
   Fe-Ni alloy shows great promise and can lead to a new class of
   metal-polymer nanocomposites.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A negative capacitance shunt is a basic, analog, active circuit
   electrically connected to a piezoelectric transducer to control the
   vibrations of flexural bodies. The shunt circuit consists of a resistor
   and a synthetic negative capacitor to introduce a real and imaginary
   impedance on a vibrating mechanical system. The electrical impedance of
   the negative capacitance shunt modifies the effective modulus of the
   piezoelectric transducer to reduce the stiffness and increase the
   damping, which causes a decrease in amplitude of the vibrating structure
   to which the elements are bonded. To gain an insight into the
   electromechanical coupling and power output, the shunt and the
   electrical properties of the piezoelectric transducer are modeled using
   circuit modeling software. The power output of the model is validated
   with experimental measurements of a shunt connected to a piezoelectric
   transducer pair bonded to a vibrating aluminum cantilever beam. The
   model is used to select the passive components of the negative
   capacitance shunt to increase the efficiency and quantify the voltage

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Enhancement of structure-borne wave energy harvesting is investigated by
   exploiting metamaterial-based and metamaterial-inspired electroelastic
   systems. The concepts of wave focusing, localization, and funneling are
   leveraged to establish novel metamaterial energy harvester (MEH)
   configurations. The MEH systems transform the incoming structure-borne
   wave energy into electrical energy by coupling the metamaterial and
   electroelastic domains. The energy harvesting component of the work
   employs piezoelectric transduction due to the high power density and
   ease of application offered by piezoelectric materials. Therefore, in
   all MEH configurations studied in this work, the metamaterial system is
   combined with piezoelectric energy harvesting for enhanced electricity
   generation from waves propagating in elastic structures. Experiments are
   conducted to validate the dramatic performance enhancement in MEH
   systems as compared to using the same volume of piezoelectric patch in
   the absence of the metamaterial component. It is shown that MEH systems
   can be used for both broadband and tuned wave energy harvesting. The MEH
   concepts covered in this paper are (1) wave focusing using a
   metamaterial-inspired parabolic acoustic mirror (for broadband energy
   harvesting), (2) energy localization using an imperfection in a 2D
   lattice structure (for tuned energy harvesting), and (3) wave guiding
   using an acoustic funnel (for narrow-to-broadband energy harvesting). It
   is shown that MEH systems can boost the harvested power by more than an
   order of magnitude.}},

   investigated whether the overexpression of a phosphofructokinase (PFK),

   establish the pathway in this organism. Introduction of a
   pyrophosphate-dependent PFK, along with co-expression of homologous

   not result in an EMP flux to any appreciable level. However, the
   metabolism of glucose was impacted significantly. Eight percent of
   glucose was metabolized to form a new metabolite, dihydroxyacetone.
   Reducing flux through the ED pathway by as much as 40 \% through
   antisense of a key enzyme, ED aldolase, did not result in a fully
   functional EMP pathway, suggesting that the ED pathway, especially the
   lower arm, downstream from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is very rigid,

Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To discover principles of flipper-based terrestrial locomotion we study
   the mechanics of a hatchling sea turtle-inspired robot, FlipperBot
   (FBot), during quasi-static movement on granular media. FBot implements
   a symmetric gait using two servo-motor-driven front limbs with
   flat-plate flippers and either freely rotating or fixed wrist joints.
   For a range of gaits, FBot moves with a constant step length. However,
   for gaits with sufficiently shallow flipper penetration or sufficiently
   large stroke, per step displacement decreases with each successive step
   resulting in failure (zero forward displacement) within a few steps. For
   the fixed wrist, failure occurs when FBot interacts with ground
   disturbed during previous steps, and measurements reveal that flipper
   generated forces decrease as per step displacement decreases. The
   biologically inspired free wrist is less prone to failure, but
   slip-induced failure can still occur if FBot pitches forward and drives
   its leading edge into the substrate. In the constant step length regime,
   kinematic and force-based models accurately predict FBot's motion for
   free and fixed wrist configurations, respectively. When combined with
   independent force measurements, models and experiments provide insight
   into how disturbed ground leads to locomotory failure and help explain
   differences in hatchling sea turtle performance.}},

Abstract = {{The previously described cyclic pathway method for deposition of atomic

   Au1-4Pd2 bimetallic atomic clusters in polyaniline (PANI). The
   controlled deposition of predetermined atomic size clusters of metals
   has been examined by testing the electrochemical oxidation of n-propanol
   in 1 M NaOH. The oxidation peak currents from the cyclic voltammograms
   were found to follow the same trend as the changes of the calculated
   HOMO-LUMO gap energies. The FTIR signature of PANI for these films also
   followed the calculated trend. This study also looks at the effects of
   atomic arrangement in the atomic structure on the support matrix of
   PANI. The results presented here have shown that the cyclic pathway is a
   versatile method for the atomic deposition of single metal, bimetallic,

Abstract = {{This paper describes an intelligent controller that combines an
   auto-calibration state-trajectory-based control method with a simple
   algorithm that enables fault detection. The application of the
   controller to achieve intelligent electronic pressure control in a fluid
   power system is included. More specifically, the proposed control
   algorithm is designed to learn the inverse input-state map of an
   Electro-Hydraulic Poppet Valve (EHPV) with the aid of a Nodal Link
   Perceptron Network (NLPN). While in operation, the controller enforces
   the tracking of a desired hydraulic supply pressure profile at the same
   time that it learns the inverse input-state calibration map and monitors
   the latter for deviations from prescribed bounds. The tracking
   performance of the auto-calibration scheme is validated experimentally
   and the fault detection algorithm is explored via a computer simulation.

   Three-Dimensional Deformation using Two-Dimensional Digital Image
   Correlation}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Digital Image Correlation (DIC) provides a full-field non-contact
   optical method for accurate deformation measurement of materials,
   devices and structures. The measurement of three-dimensional (3D)
   deformation using DIC in general requires imaging with two cameras and a
   3D-DIC code. In the present work, a new experimental technique, namely,
   Diffraction Assisted Image Correlation (DAIC) for 3D displacement
   measurement using a single camera and 2D-DIC algorithm is presented. A
   transmission diffraction grating is placed between the specimen and the
   camera, resulting in multiple images which are then used to obtain
   apparent in-plane displacements using 2D-DIC. The true in-plane and
   out-of-plane displacements of the specimen are obtained from the
   apparent in-plane displacements and the diffraction angle of the
   grating. The validity and accuracy of the DAIC method are demonstrated
   through 3D displacement measurement of a small thin membrane. This
   technique provides new avenues for performing 3D deformation
   measurements at small length scales and/or dynamic loading conditions.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{GE-7031 varnish, a commonly used low-temperature adhesive and electrical
   insulator owing to its high thermal conductivity and mechanical strength
   at low temperatures, was used as a sample matrix for low-temperature
   powder X-ray diffraction measurements of the negative thermal expansion
   (NTE) material ScF3. When ScF3 powder was mixed with GE-7031 varnish, an
   unexpected cubic to rhombohedral phase transition in the ScF3 sample was
   observed at similar to 50 K, and it exhibited smaller low-temperature
   unit-cell volumes than samples without the varnish matrix. Experimental
   observations and quantitative estimates suggest that these anomalies are
   the result of stress induced by a thermal expansion mismatch between the
   varnish matrix (large positive coefficient of thermal expansion, CTE)
   and ScF3 (quite large negative CTE). The use of GE-7031 varnish as a
   sample matrix for low-temperature measurements should be approached with
   caution if a large thermal expansion mismatch is expected.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Formal functional assessment tools for use with older adults
   have been in widespread use since the 1960s. Instruments have been
   designed to assess a wide range of different aspects of a person's
   everyday life. This article seeks to document the evolution of the tools
   used in such a way as to inform the development of the field.
   Study Design and Setting: The Medline, CINHAL, and Science Direct
   databases were searched for relevant literature relating to the
   functional assessment of older adults. After analysis of initial
   results, a second-stage search was conducted to find literature relating
   to the use and validation of instruments found initially.
   Results: Four categories of functional assessment instruments were
   identified for the purposes of this article: basic activities of daily
   living (ADLs), instrumental ADL, global health scales, and
   performance-based tests of functional ability. These categories and
   several of the most widely used tools therein are discussed
   chronologically to document the evolution of the field.
   Conclusions: With the advancement of technology has come the possibility
   to perform functional assessments in new ways. This outline of the
   evolution of functional assessment should be of considerable use as
   researchers seek to design new functional assessments for older adults.

Abstract = {{There are quite a few studies investigating low Reynolds number
   turbulence models for predicting the near-wall flow over smooth walls.
   However, analogous work over rough walls is sparse despite the fact that
   many flows of practical interest, particularly in geophysical flows and
   hydraulic engineering, are over rough walls. This paper presents a
   priori and a posteriori evaluations of low Reynolds number
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)-based modeling approaches for
   flows over rough walls with the help of high-resolution large-eddy
   simulation (LES) data. The LES data allow the calculation of the
   vertical distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy, the dissipation
   rate, the specific dissipation rate, and the turbulent eddy viscosity,
   so that the assumptions inherent of RANS-based turbulence models can be
   tested a priori. A posteriori testing of the models through RANS
   simulations showed that the three low Reynolds turbulence models
   evaluated in this paper provide a fairly accurate prediction of the
   velocity profile, turbulent eddy viscosity, and wall shear stress. (C)

Title = {{Impacts of Climate Change on Scour-Vulnerable Bridges: Assessment Based

Abstract = {{More than 20\% of the bridges in the United States were built more than
   50 years ago, at a time in which intense precipitation events were much
   less common. However, very little work has been done on the use of scour
   risk-assessment models to assess how climate change increases bridge
   failure probabilities. This paper develops a risk-assessment framework
   based on HYRISK, a model developed to assess the probability of a bridge
   failure due to scour, and illustrates one way in which current
   engineering risk-assessment models can be used to quantify the
   additional risks and expected economic losses associated with a changing
   climate. Application of this framework to all bridges in the United
   States that carry vehicular traffic over water finds that economic
   losses due to climate change factors will increase by at least 15\% over
   current losses and that the expected number of annual bridge failures in
   the United States will increase by at least 10\% over current failures.
   Climate-based risk measures, such as those developed as part of this
   study, could be included in asset management systems to help state DOTs
   prioritize maintenance, operation, and replacement schedules. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The effect of the alpha-quartz-to-coesite silica phase transformation on
   the load-carrying and energy-dissipation capacities of
   ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) under dynamic loading with
   hydrostatic pressures of up to 10 GPa is evaluated. The model resolves
   essential deformation and failure mechanisms and provides a
   phenomenological account of the transformation. Four modes of energy
   dissipated are tracked, including inelastic deformation, distributed
   cracking, interfacial friction, and the energy dissipated through
   transformation of the quartz aggregate. Simulations are carried out over
   a range of volume fractions of the constituent phases. Results show that
   the phase transformation has a significant effect on the
   energy-dissipation capacity of UHPC for the conditions studied. Although
   transformation accounts for less than 2\% of the total energy
   dissipation, the transformation leads to a twofold increase in the crack
   density and yields almost an 18\% increase in the overall energy
   dissipation. Structure-response relations that can be used for materials
   design are established. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that the cloud computing industry faces many decision
   problems where operations research (OR) could add tremendous value. To
   this end, we provide an OR perspective on cloud computing in three ways.
   First, we compare the cloud computing process with the traditional pull
   supply chain and introduce the cloud IT supply chain as the system of
   moving information from suppliers to consumers through the cloud
   network. Second, based on this analogy, we organize the cloud computing
   decision space by identifying the problems that need to be solved by
   each player in the supply chain-namely, (1) cloud providers, (2) cloud
   consumers, and (3) cloud brokers. We list the OR problems of interest
   from each player's perspective and discuss the tools that may need to be
   developed to solve them. Third, we survey past and current research in
   this space and discuss future research opportunities in cloud computing

   degradation signals from both numerical experiments and a case study

Abstract = {{Patient-specific models of the heart's mitral valve (MV) exhibit
   potential for surgical planning. While advances in 3D echocardiography
   (3DE) have provided adequate resolution to extract MV leaflet geometry,
   no study has quantitatively assessed the accuracy of their modeled
   leaflets vs. a ground-truth standard for temporal frames beyond systolic
   closure or for differing valvular dysfunctions. The accuracy of a
   3DE-based segmentation methodology based on J-splines was assessed for
   porcine MVs with known 4D leaflet coordinates within a pulsatile
   simulator during closure, peak closure, and opening for a control,
   prolapsed, and billowing MV model. For all time points, the mean
   distance error between the segmented models and ground-truth data were
   0.40 +/- A 0.32 mm, 0.52 +/- A 0.51 mm, and 0.74 +/- A 0.69 mm for the
   control, flail, and billowing models. For all models and temporal
   frames, 95\% of the distance errors were below 1.64 mm. When applied to
   a patient data set, segmentation was able to confirm a regurgitant
   orifice and post-operative improvements in coaptation. This study
   provides an experimental platform for assessing the accuracy of an MV
   segmentation methodology at phases beyond systolic closure and for
   differing MV dysfunctions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of a MV
   segmentation methodology for the development of future surgical planning
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{A new whole-core transport method is described for 3-D hexagonal
   geometry. This is an extension of a stochastic-deterministic hybrid
   method which has previously been shown highly accurate and efficient for
   eigenvalue problems. Via Monte Carlo, it determines the solution to the
   transport equation in sub-regions of reactor cores, such as individual
   fuel elements or sections thereof, and uses those solutions to compose a
   library of response expansion coefficients. The information acquired
   allows the deterministic solution procedure to arrive at the whole core
   solution for the eigenvalue and the explicit fuel pin fission density
   distribution more quickly than other transport methods. Because it
   solves the transport equation stochastically, complicated geometry may
   be modeled exactly and therefore heterogeneity even at the most detailed
   level does not challenge the method.
   In this paper, the method is evaluated using comparisons with full core
   Monte Carlo reference solutions of benchmark problems based on
   gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor core designs. Solutions are given
   for core eigenvalue problems and the calculation of fuel pin fission
   densities throughout the core. Using a single processor, results are
   found in minutes for small cores, and in no more than a few hours for a
   realistically large core; attempts to optimize the computational speed
   by parallel computing or advanced acceleration schemes are left for
   future work. Typical eigenvalues calculated by the method differ from
   reference solutions by less than 0.1\%, and pin fission density
   calculations have average accuracy of well within 1\%, even for
   unrealistically challenging core configuration problems. This new method
   enables the accurate determination of core eigenvalues and flux shapes
   in hexagonal cores with efficiency far exceeding that of other transport
   methods. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Attainment of functional vascularization of engineered constructs is one
   of the fundamental challenges of tissue engineering. However, the
   development of an extracellular matrix in most tissues, including bone,
   is dependent upon the establishment of a well developed vascular supply.
   In this study a poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) salt-leached sponge was
   modified by incorporation of silk fibroin fibers to create a
   multicomponent scaffold, in an effort to better support endothelial cell
   colonization and to promote in vivo vascularization. Scaffolds with and
   without silk fibroin fibers were compared for microstructure, mechanical
   properties, ability to maintain cell populations in vitro as well as to
   permit vascular ingrowth into acellular constructs in vivo. We
   demonstrated that adding silk fibroin fibers to a PDLLA salt-leached
   sponge enhanced scaffold properties and heightened its capacity to
   support endothelial cells in vitro and to promote vascularization in
   vivo. Therefore refinement of scaffold properties by inclusion of
   materials with beneficial attributes may promote and shape cellular
   responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) affects one in every 400 children and adolescents
   in the US. Due to the limitations of exogenous insulin therapy and whole
   pancreas transplantation, pancreatic islet transplantation has emerged
   as a promising therapy for T1DM. However, this therapy is severely
   limited by donor islet availability and poor islet engraftment and
   function. We engineered an injectable bio-synthetic, polyethylene
   glycol-maleimide hydrogel to enhance vascularization and engraftment of
   transplanted pancreatic islets in a mouse model of T1DM. Controlled
   presentation of VEGF-A and cell-adhesive peptides within this engineered
   material significantly improved the vascularization and function of
   islets delivered to the small bowel mesentery, a metabolically relevant
   site for insulin release. Diabetic mice receiving islets transplanted in
   proteolytically degradable hydrogels incorporating VEGF-A exhibited
   complete reversal of diabetic hyperglycemia with a 40\% reduction in the
   number of islets required. Furthermore, hydrogel-delivered islets
   significantly improved weight gain, regulation of a glucose challenge,
   and intra-islet vascularization and engraftment compared to the clinical
   standard of islet infusion through the hepatic portal vein. This study
   establishes a simple biomaterial strategy for islet transplantation to
   promote enhanced islet engraftment and function. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Regeneration of bone requires the coordinated processes of angiogenesis
   and osteogenesis. These repair mechanisms are closely linked through
   both direct cell-cell contact and indirect paracrine signaling among
   osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and other cell types. The vasculature
   provides a source of nutrients, oxygen, metabolic substrates, and access
   for circulating cells that help to support new bone formation. The
   complexity of the endogenous signaling axis that promotes angiogenesis
   provides numerous opportunities for therapeutic intervention ranging
   from progenitor cell mobilization to endothelial proliferation and
   sprouting. Small molecules are particularly appealing for regenerative
   medicine applications because many exhibit extended in vivo stability,
   low cost, and scalable production. Innovative techniques for developing
   small molecules such as high throughput functional assays and
   broad-spectrum database analysis techniques have led to the development
   of new compounds and the identification of novel applications of
   existing drugs. In addition, rapid advances in biomaterials design and
   synthesis provide platforms to deliver therapeutic small molecules to
   sites of bone injury. This review presents an overview of current
   strategies for harnessing endogenous healing mechanisms using small
   molecules by targeting angiogenesis, osteogenesis, or both.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Tungsten is an important material for energy harvesting applications due
   to its high chemical and thermal stability; however, the difficulty in
   obtaining single-crystal films leads to a large variation in the optical
   properties. The present work focuses on the radiative and optical
   properties of thin tungsten films at wavelengths from 1 to 20 gm
   (wavenumbers from 10,000 to 500 cm(-1)), considering microstructural
   variations. Four films of a nominal thickness of 70 nm were deposited on
   silicon substrates using DC magnetron sputtering, and the effect of pre-
   and post-deposition treatments was investigated. Several analytical
   instruments were used to characterize the crystalline phases and
   microstructures, including X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The
   transmittance and reflectance of the film-substrate composites were
   measured at room temperature using a Fourier-transform infrared
   spectrometer. The dielectric function of each sample was obtained by
   fitting the measured radiative properties using the Drude-Lorentz
   dispersion model. The difference in the radiative properties between
   samples was analyzed and related to the crystalline phases and density.

Abstract = {{Gas adsorption and stability to liquid water, humid air, and acid gasses
   on metal organic frameworks have been studied using a high-throughput
   adsorption measurement system. Among the seven MOFs studied, Cu-HF,
   Zn-NDC, and Ni-NIC showed higher CO2/N-2 sorption selectivities, (8-12),
   than the other MOFs (similar to 4), mainly due to high CO2 adsorption.
   Long term (5 days) NO2 exposure, as well as exposure to liquid water,
   resulted in partial decomposition of the original structure of Zn-NDC
   with a corresponding 26-30\% decrease in CO2 adsorption capacity. No
   noticeable changes in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were observed for
   the other MOFs with small variations in adsorption capacities,
   indicating structural robustness to acid gas and liquid water.
   Short-term exposure to humid air (3 d) and acid gasses (2 d) caused a
   decrease in CO2 and N-2 adsorption capacity for Cu-HF and an increase in
   adsorption capacity for Ni-NIC. Measurements indicate that pore
   flexibility in Cu-HF, Zn-NDC, Ni-NIC and Cu-NH2 is modulated by
   temperature: large SF6 molecules are rejected from the pores at room
   temperature (as expected based on kinetic diameter), but N-2, which does
   adsorb internally at room temperature, is rejected from the pores at 77

Title = {{Tailoring Adipose Stem Cell Trophic Factor Production with
   Differentiation Medium Components to Regenerate Chondral Defects}},
Journal = {{TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent endeavors to use stem cells as trophic factor production sources
   have the potential to translate into viable therapies for damaged or
   diseased musculoskeletal tissues. Adipose stem cells (ASCs) can be
   differentiated into chondrocytes using the chondrogenic medium (CM), but
   it is unknown if this approach can optimize ASC growth factor secretion
   for cartilage regeneration by increasing the chondrogenic factor
   production, while decreasing angiogenic and hypertrophic factor
   production. The objective of this study was to determine the effects the
   CM and its components have on growth factor production from ASCs to
   promote cartilage regeneration. ASCs isolated from male Sprague-Dawley
   rats and cultured in monolayer or alginate microbeads were treated with
   either the growth medium (GM) or the CM for 5 days. In subsequent
   studies, ASC monolayers were treated with either the GM supplemented
   with different combinations of 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid-2-phosphate
   (AA2P), 100nM dexamethasone (Dex), 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor
   (TGF)-beta 1, and 100 ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-6 or with
   the CM excluding different combinations of AA2P, Dex, TGF-beta 1, and
   BMP-6. mRNA levels and growth factor production were quantified at 8 and
   24 h after the last media change, respectively. The CM increased
   chondrogenic factor secretion (TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 3, and insulin-like
   growth factor {[}IGF]-I) and decreased angiogenic factor production (the
   vascular endothelial growth factor {[}VEGF]-A, the fibroblast growth
   factor {[}FGF]-2). Microencapsulation in the GM increased production of
   the chondrogenic (IGF-I, TGF-beta 2) and angiogenic (VEGF-A) factors.
   AA2P increased secretion of chondrogenic factors (IGF-I, TGF-beta 2),
   and decreased angiogenic factor (VEGF-A) secretion, in addition to
   decreasing mRNA levels for factors associated with chondrocyte
   hypertrophy (FGF-18). Dex increased mRNA levels for hypertrophic factors
   (BMP-2, FGF-18) and decreased angiogenic factor secretion (VEGF-A).
   TGF-beta 1 increased angiogenic factor production (FGF-2, VEGF-A) and
   decreased chondrogenic factor mRNA levels (IGF-I, PTHrP). BMP-6
   increased hypertrophic mRNA levels (FGF-18) and chondrogenic factor
   production (TGF-beta 2). When ASC microbeads preconditioned with the CM
   were implanted in a focal cartilage defect and immobilized within an
   RGD-conjugated hydrogel, tissue infiltration from the edges of the
   defect and perichondrium was observed. These results show that
   differentiation media components have distinct effects on ASC's
   production of angiogenic, chondrogenic, and hypertrophic factors and
   that AA2P may be the most beneficial CM component for preconditioning
   ASCs to stimulate cartilage regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary studies have suggested that the reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) may be effective in inhibiting
   the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. In-depth cellular and molecular
   analyses were carried out to determine NAC's mode of action in
   inhibiting the growth of a well-characterized pancreatic cancer cell
   line (AsPC-1). Standardized assays were used to monitor cellular growth,
   apoptosis, levels of ROS, cellular senescence, migration, and
   invasiveness. Cell stiffness was measured using atomic force microscopy.
   Gene expression was monitored by quantitative PCR. NAC significantly
   inhibits the growth and metastatic potential of AsPC-1 cells by inducing
   cell- cycle arrest in G1 and subsequent cellular senescence and
   decreased invasiveness. These anticancer properties are associated with
   an unexpected increase in the intracellular concentrations of ROS. NAC
   does not decrease the susceptibility of AsPC-1 cells to the anticancer
   drugs gemcitabine, mitomycin C, and doxorubicin. NAC-induced changes in
   gene expression are consistent with the onset of
   mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. In conclusion, our findings
   indicate that NAC induces an integrated series of responses in AsPC-1
   cells that make it a highly promising candidate for development as a
   pancreatic cancer therapeutic. Anti-Cancer Drugs 24:504-518 (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Since the successful generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)
   from adult somatic cells using integrating-viral methods, various
   methods have been tried for iPSC generation using non-viral and
   non-integrating technique for clinical applications. Recently, various
   non-viral approaches such as protein, mRNA, microRNA, and small molecule
   transduction were developed to avoid genomic integration and generate
   stem cell-like cells from mouse and human fibroblasts. Despite these
   successes, there has been no successful generation of iPSC from bone
   marrow (BM)-derived hematopoietic cells derived using non-viral methods
   to date. Previous reports demonstrate the ability of polymeric micro and
   nanoparticles made from polyketals to deliver various molecules to
   macrophages. MicroRNA-loaded nanoparticles were created using the
   polyketal polymer PK3 (PK3-miR) and delivered to somatic cells for 6
   days, resulting in the formation of colonies. Isolated cells from these
   colonies were assayed and substantial induction of the pluripotency
   markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog were detected. Moreover, colonies
   transferred to feeder layers also stained positive for pluripotency
   markers including SSEA-1. Here, we demonstrate successful activation of
   pluripotency-associated genes in mouse BM-mononuclear cells using
   embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific microRNAs encapsulated in the acid
   sensitive polyketal PK3. These reprogramming results demonstrate that a
   polyketal-microRNA delivery vehicle can be used to generate various
   reprogrammed cells without permanent genetic manipulation in an
   efficient manner. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   investigate a set of important properties of Gadara nets, such as
   liveness, reversibility, and linear separability. We propose efficient
   algorithms for the verification of liveness of Gadara nets, and report
   experimental results on their performance. We also present modeling
   examples of real-world programs. The results in this paper lay the
   foundations for the development of effective control synthesis

Abstract = {{A Serial-Parallel Multistage Manufacturing Process (SP-MMP) may have
   multiple variation propagation modes in its production runs when process
   routes vary from part to part. Conventional methods that ignore such

   when the available engineering domain knowledge is insufficient to
   characterize the variation streams. This article proposes a data-driven
   method, piecewise linear regression trees, to interrelate the variables
   for an SP-MMP with multimode variation. A unified control chart system
   is developed to monitor the process considering modeling uncertainty.
   The application to a more generic multistage multimode process is
   discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed procedure is
   demonstrated in an application involving a wafer manufacturing process.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement strategy and sensor allocation have a direct impact on the
   product quality, productivity, and cost. This article studies the
   couplings or interactions between the optimal design of a sensor system
   and quality management in a manufacturing system, which can improve
   cost-effectiveness and production yield by considering sensor cost,
   process change detection speed, and fault diagnosis accuracy. Based on
   an established definition of sensor allocation in a Bayesian network, an
   algorithm named Best Allocation Subsets by Intelligent Search (BASIS) is
   developed in this article to obtain the optimal sensor allocation design
   at minimum cost under different specified Average Run Length (ARL)
   requirements. Unlike previous approaches reported in the literature, the
   BASIS algorithm is developed based on investigating a multivariate T 2
   control chart when only partial observations are available. After
   implementing the derived optimal sensor solution, a diagnosis ranking
   method is proposed to find the root cause variables by ranking all of
   the identified potential faults. Two case studies are conducted on a hot

Abstract = {{HIV positive patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
   have shown elevated incidence of a number of non-AIDS defining
   co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease. Given that HAART
   regimens contain a combination of at least three drugs, that disease
   management often requires adjustment of these regimens, and HIV,
   independent of HAART, also plays a role in development of
   co-morbidities, determining the role of specific HAART drugs and HIV
   infection itself from clinical data remains challenging. To characterize
   specific mediators and underlying mechanisms of disease, in vitro and in
   vivo animal models are required, in parallel with clinical data. Given
   its low cost azidothymidine (AZT) contributes to the backbone of a large
   proportion of HAART treated patients in the developing world where much
   of the global burden of HIV resides. The goal of this study was to test
   the hypothesis that AZT can lead to proatherogenic changes including the
   subclinical markers of arterial stiffening and intima-media thickening
   in mice. AZT (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered to wild-type FVB/N
   mice via oral gavage for 35 days. Cylindrical biaxial biomechanical
   tests on the common carotid arteries and suprarenal aortas exhibited
   arterial stiffening in AZT mice compared to controls. Multiphoton
   microscopy and histology demonstrated that AZT led to increased
   intima-media thickness. These data correlated with decreased elastin
   content and increased protease activity as measured by cathepsin
   zymography; no differences were observed in collagen content or
   organization, in vivo axial stretch, or opening angle. Thus, this study
   suggests the drug AZT has significant effects on the development of
   subclinical markers of atherosclerosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{459}},
Pages = {{114-120}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{The zeolite catalyzed gas phase alkylation of phenol with propylene is
   studied with an aim to maximize the production of 2-isopropylphenol
   instead of the usual focus with zeolites of producing the para product,
   in this case 4-isopropylphenol. The reaction pathway studies show that
   2-isopropylphenol and 4-isopropylphenol are the primary products of the
   alkylation reactions, as expected. Additionally, it is determined that
   3-isopropylphenol and 4-isopropylphenol do not participate in secondary
   reactions once they are formed, while 2-isopropylphenol and
   isopropylphenyl ether are more likely to de-alkylate than isomerize in
   secondary reactions. Of the zeolite topologies studied (FAU, BEA, MOR,
   MFI, TUN, MEL, MWW, MTT, CHA), maximum 2-isopropylphenol selectivity is
   obtained when the reactions are not restricted in the zeolite pores and
   the conversion occurs predominantly on the external surface. For
   intrazeolitic reactions, BEA zeolite maximizes the 2-isopropylphenol
   selectivity by balancing diffusion and steric limitations with secondary
   reactions producing di-alkylated products. The sensitivity of the
   product selectivity to zeolite pore size when the reaction occurs mainly
   in the pores suggests this reaction could be used as a test to estimate
   the pore size of an unknown zeolite. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To understand the influence of orthogonal conjugation pathways fused
   directly to pi-conjugated polymer backbones, we synthesized and studied
   three series of thiophene-based model compounds containing benzene,
   naphthalene, and anthracene pen-substituted central cores as
   representative acenes. These models were functionalized with methyl
   groups at the reactive thiophene positions in order to generate and
   observe oxidized species without complications from follow-up
   polymerization. The neutral monomers and their oxidized charged
   counterparts were subjected to cyclic voltammetry,
   spectroelectrochemistry, and EPR spectroscopy as appropriate, and these
   results were further corroborated with thorough density functional
   theory studies. This joint experimental and theoretical analysis allowed
   us to determine that benzene-based conjugated linkers led to more
   delocalized charge carriers on account of the quinoidal character
   maintained within the benzene core. In contrast, anthracene-based
   linkers displayed very localized carriers due to torsional strain
   between the adjacent aryl groups and to the local evolution of formal
   aromatic sextets on the benzo-fused rings orthogonal to the backbone in
   the quinoidal state. In some cases, the electronics of the
   thiophene-based substituent dominated the electronic properties of the
   oxidized species regardless of the nature of the central acene linker.
   These results highlight the dramatic influence that orthogonal
   conjugation pathways can exert on the electronic properties of
   pi-conjugated materials.}},

Title = {{Discrete variable representation in electronic structure theory:
   Quadrature grids for least-squares tensor hypercontraction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the application of molecular quadratures obtained from
   either standard Becke-type grids or discrete variable representation
   (DVR) techniques to the recently developed least-squares tensor
   hypercontraction (LS-THC) representation of the electron repulsion
   integral (ERI) tensor. LS-THC uses least-squares fitting to renormalize
   a two-sided pseudospectral decomposition of the ERI, over a
   physical-space quadrature grid. While this procedure is technically
   applicable with any choice of grid, the best efficiency is obtained when
   the quadrature is tuned to accurately reproduce the overlap metric for
   quadratic products of the primary orbital basis. Properly selected Becke
   DFT grids can roughly attain this property. Additionally, we provide
   algorithms for adopting the DVR techniques of the dynamics community to
   produce two different classes of grids which approximately attain this
   property. The simplest algorithm is radial discrete variable
   representation (R-DVR), which diagonalizes the finite auxiliary-basis
   representation of the radial coordinate for each atom, and then combines
   Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures and Becke atomic partitioning to
   produce the full molecular quadrature grid. The other algorithm is full
   discrete variable representation (F-DVR), which uses approximate
   simultaneous diagonalization of the finite auxiliary-basis
   representation of the full position operator to produce
   non-direct-product quadrature grids. The qualitative features of all
   three grid classes are discussed, and then the relative efficiencies of
   these grids are compared in the context of LS-THC-DF-MP2. Coarse Becke
   grids are found to give essentially the same accuracy and efficiency as
   R-DVR grids; however, the latter are built from explicit knowledge of
   the basis set and may guide future development of atom-centered grids.
   F-DVR is found to provide reasonable accuracy with markedly fewer points
   than either Becke or R-DVR schemes. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate dose calculation is a central component of radiotherapy
   treatment planning. A new method of dose calculation has been developed
   based on transport theory and validated by comparison to Monte Carlo
   methods. The coarse mesh transport method has been extended to allow
   coupled photon-electron transport in 3D. The method combines stochastic
   pre-computation with a deterministic solver to achieve high accuracy and
   precision. To enhance the method for radiotherapy calculations, a new
   angular basis was derived, and an analytical source treatment was
   developed. Validation was performed by comparison to DOSXYZnrc using a
   heterogeneous interface phantom composed of water, aluminum, and lung.
   Calculations of both kinetic energy released per unit mass and dose were
   compared. Good agreement was found with a maximum error and root mean
   square relative error of less than 1.5\% for all cases. The results show
   that the new method achieves an accuracy comparable to Monte Carlo.}},

Title = {{3-D microstructure reconstruction of polymer nano-composite using

Abstract = {{3-D reconstruction of Halloysite nanotube (HNT) polypropylene composite
   has been performed using two different methods. In the first method,
   several slices of the composite material were obtained using focused ion
   beam (FIB), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A representative
   volume element (RVE) of the real material's micro/nanostructures was
   then constructed by stacking these morphological images using VCAT (R)
   software. In the second method, SEM images of the nano-composite were
   used to extract statistical two-point correlation function (TPCF), for
   reconstruction of an RVE of the nano-composite.
   The resulting RVEs obtained from both methods were meshed for finite
   element (FE) simulation of deformation under tension and shear loadings.
   The FE results were then used to compute the stiffness tensor of the
   nano-composite.
   In the statistical approach, the TPCF was obtained from a none-Eigen
   microstructure which can partially reflect statistical information of
   the microstructure. The mechanical constants obtained from statistical
   RVEs using FEM approach shows a 5.7\% error compared with those obtained
   from real RVE, which could be attributed to the approximation using TPCF
   {[}1].
   It is concluded that the statistical method using TPCF alone can produce
   an approximate microstructure that should be modified using other
   statistical descriptor such as two-point cluster function and lineal
   path function to have better reconstruction of heterogeneous
   nano-composites {[}2]. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental insight into how low pressure adsorption properties are
   affected by chemical functionalization is critical to the development of
   next-generation porous materials for postcombustion CO2 capture. In this
   work, we present a systematic approach to understanding low pressure CO2
   affinity in isostructural metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using
   molecular simulations and apply it to obtain quantitative,
   molecular-level insight into interesting experimental low pressure
   adsorption trends in a series of pillared MOFs. Our experimental results
   show that increasing the number of nonpolar functional groups on the
   benzene dicarboxylate (BDC) linker in the pillared DMOF-1
   {[}Zn-2(BDC)(2)(DABCO)] structure is an effective way to tune the CO2
   Henrys coefficient in this isostructural series. These findings are
   contrary to the common scenario where polar functional groups induce the
   greatest increase in low pressure affinity through polarization of the
   CO2 molecule. Instead, MOFs in this isostructural series containing
   nitro, hydroxyl, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine functional groups
   result in little increase to the low pressure CO2 affinity. Strong
   agreement between simulated and experimental Henrys coefficient values
   is obtained from simulations on representative structures, and a
   powerful yet simple approach involving the analysis of the simulated
   heats of adsorption, adsorbate density distributions, and minimum energy
   0 K binding sites is presented to elucidate the intermolecular
   interactions governing these interesting trends. Through a combined
   experimental and simulation approach, we demonstrate how subtle,
   structure-specific differences in CO2 affinity induced by
   functionalization can be understood at the molecular-level through
   classical simulations. This work also illustrates how structure-property
   relationships resulting from chemical functionalization can be very
   specific to the topology and electrostatic environment in the structure
   of interest. Given the excellent agreement between experiments and
   simulation, predicted CO2 selectivities over N-2, CH4, and CO are also
   investigated to demonstrate that methyl groups also provide the greatest
   increase in CO2 selectivity relative to the other functional groups.
   These results indicate that methyl ligand functionalization may be a
   promising approach for creating both water stable and CO2 selective
   variations of other MOFs for various industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a closed-form solution is presented for bending analysis
   of shape memory alloy (SMA) beams. Two different transformation
   functions are considered: a J(2)-based model with symmetric
   tension-compression response, and a J(2)-I-1-based model for considering
   the tension-compression asymmetry that is observed in experiments. The
   constitutive equations are reduced to an appropriate form for studying
   the pseudoelastic bending response of SMAs. Closed-form expressions are
   given for the stress and martensitic volume fraction distributions in
   the cross section and the bending moment-curvature relation is obtained
   analytically. Both circular and rectangular cross sections are
   considered and several case studies are presented for testing the
   accuracy of the method and also the effect of taking into account the
   tension-compression asymmetry on the bending response of SMAs. The
   results of a three-point bending test on an SMA beam are presented and
   compared with the theoretical predictions. Using some experimental data
   on bending of a nickel-titanium micropillar the applicability of the
   present method in the micro scale is studied. It is shown that this
   method can be used for assessing the tensile properties of materials in
   this special case, where the compressive and bending responses are known
   from experiments while the tensile properties are very difficult to be
   measured experimentally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Instead of block copolymers that have been widely used in controlling
   thin film morphology, a mixture of two homopolymers has been used in
   this study to create desired nano- to microporous structure. By further
   modifying the nano-sized porous structured surface, a superhydrophobic
   surface was obtained. Experimentally, a chloroform solution containing a
   mixture of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) was first
   coated on glass slides. Because of the dissimilarity of PLA and PEO, a
   microphase separation happened and the PEO formed microdomains in the
   coating layer during the film drying. Because PEO is water soluble but
   PLA is water-insoluble, the PEO microdomains could be washed out with
   water but PLA remained, resulted in a porous and rough PLA film. By two
   or three layer coating and washing, nano-sized roughness was obtained. A
   thin layer of fluorinated acrylic resin was further deposited on the
   rough surface. Because of the synergistic effect of surface roughness
   and hydrophobic, a superhydrophobicicity layer was obtained. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The mechanisms influencing impact initiation of reactions in structural
   energetic materials formed by explosive compaction of pure Ni, Ta, or W
   powders mixed with Al powder are investigated in this work. High speed
   images of rod-on-anvil impact tests indicate that the energy
   requirements for initiating reaction in Ta+Al compacts are lower than
   those in W+Al, while no reaction at all is observed in Ni+Al under the
   tested conditions. Mesoscale simulations performed on actual
   microstructures reveal differences in the deformation behavior of the
   Ni+Al, Ta+Al, and W+Al compacts under similar impact conditions. In the
   Ni+Al and W+Al systems, the impact induced deformation is localized
   primarily in the Al constituent, while significant plastic deformation
   of both constituents is observed in Ta+Al, making it a more reactive
   system. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Li/Si undergoes significant softening in the form of rapid decreases in
   elastic modulus and yield stress as lithium concentration increases. To
   investigate how this lithiation-induced softening affects the fracture
   behavior of electrodes, we formulate a J-integral for coupled mechanical
   deformation and mass diffusion processes. This measure is used to
   analyze mechano-diffusional driving forces for fracture through
   simulations using a mixed finite element framework. Calculations show
   that under tensile loading, Li accumulates in front of crack tips,
   leading to an anti-shielding effect on the energy release rate. For a
   pre-cracked Li/Si thin-film electrode, it is found that the driving
   force for fracture is significantly lower when the electrode is operated
   at higher Li concentrations a result of more effective stress relaxation
   via global yielding. The results indicate that operation at higher
   concentrations is an effective means to minimize failure of thin-film
   Li/Si alloy electrodes. A design map for avoiding failure is developed.

Abstract = {{Materials with the cubic ReO3-type structure are, in principle,
   excellent candidates for negative thermal expansion (NTE). However, many
   such materials, including TaO2F, do not display NTE. It is proposed that
   local distortions away from the ideal structure, associated with the
   need to accommodate the different bonding requirements of the disordered
   O/F, contribute to the occurrence of near zero thermal expansion rather
   than NTE. The local structure of TaO2F is poorly described by an ideal
   cubic ReO3-type model with O and F randomly distributed over the
   available anion sites. A supercell model featuring -Ta-O-Ta-O-Ta-F-
   chains along < 1 0 0 >, with different Ta-O and Ta-F distances and O/F
   off axis displacements, gives much better agreement with pair
   distribution functions (PDFs) derived from total X-ray scattering data
   for small separations (<8 angstrom). Analyses of PDFs derived from
   variable temperature measurements (80 to 487 K), over different length
   scales, indicate an average linear expansion coefficient of close to
   zero with similar contributions from the geometrically distinct Ta-O-Ta
   and Ta-F-Ta links in TaO2F.}},

Title = {{Prediction of probabilistic ignition behavior of polymer-bonded
   explosives from microstructural stochasticity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Random variations in constituent properties, constituent distribution,
   microstructural morphology, and loading cause the ignition of explosives
   to be inherently stochastic. An approach is developed to computationally
   predict and quantify the stochasticity of the ignition process in
   polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under impact loading. The method, the
   computational equivalent of carrying out multiple experiments under the
   same conditions, involves subjecting sets of statistically similar
   microstructure samples to identical overall loading and characterizing
   the statistical distribution of the ignition response of the samples.
   Specific quantities predicted based on basic material properties and
   microstructure attributes include the critical time to ignition at given
   load intensity and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition
   occurs. The analyses carried out focus on the influence of random
   microstructure geometry variations on the critical time to ignition at
   given load intensity and the critical impact velocity below which no
   ignition occurs. Results show that the probability distribution of the
   time to criticality (t(c)) follows the Weibull distribution. This
   probability distribution is quantified as a function of microstructural
   attributes including grain volume fraction, grain size, specific
   binder-grain interface area, and the stochastic variations of these
   attributes. The relations reveal that the specific binder-grain
   interface area and its stochastic variation have the most influence on
   the critical time to ignition and the critical impact velocity below
   which no ignition is observed. For a PBX with 95\%
   octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine content, the
   computationally predicted minimum impact velocity for ignition is in the
   range of 54-63 ms(-1) depending on microstructure. This range is
   comparable to values measured experimentally for PBX9501 (53 ms(-1) by
   Chidester et al., ``Low amplitude impact testing and analysis of
   pristine and aged solid high explosives,{''} in Eleventh (International)
   Symposium on Detonation, ONR (1998), 33300. 60-84 ms(-1) by Gruau et

Abstract = {{Analytic energy gradients for the orbital-optimized second-order
   Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (OMP2) are presented. The OMP2 method
   is applied to difficult chemical systems, including those where spatial
   or spin symmetry-breaking instabilities are observed. The performance of
   the OMP2 method is compared with that of second-order Moller-Plesset
   perturbation theory (MP2) for investigating geometries and vibrational
   frequencies of the cis-HOOH+, trans-HOOH+, LiO2, C-3(+), and NO2
   molecules. For harmonic vibrational frequencies, the OMP2 method
   eliminates the singularities arising from the abnormal response
   contributions observed for MP2 in case of symmetry-breaking problems,
   and provides significantly improved vibrational frequencies for the
   above molecules. We also consider the hydrogen transfer reactions
   between several free radicals, for which MP2 provides poor reaction
   energies. The OMP2 method again exhibits a considerably better
   performance than MP2, providing a mean absolute error of 2.3 kcal
   mol(-1), which is more than 5 times lower than that of MP2 (13.2 kcal
   mol(-1)). Overall, the OMP2 method seems quite helpful for
   electronically challenging chemical systems such as symmetry-breaking
   molecules, hydrogen transfer reactions, or other cases where standard
   MP2 proves unreliable. For such systems, we recommend using OMP2 instead
   of MP2 as a more robust method with the same computational scaling. (C)

Abstract = {{Detailed density functional theory calculations have been performed to
   investigate the adsorption and diffusion of the Rh and Au adatom on the
   graphene moire superstructure on Ru(0001). The adsorption energies of
   each adatom in all of the non-equivalent C-top and C-6 ring center sites
   on the graphene moire have been calculated. The resulting potential
   energy surfaces encompass the entire graphene moire unit cell and shows
   that the adsorption of both Rh-1 and Au-1 is most stable in the fcc
   region on the graphene moire. The minimum-energy diffusion path between
   adjacent moire cells is identified to run mostly directly between the
   fcc and hcp regions for Au-1, but deviates toward the mound region for
   Rh-1. The global diffusion barrier is estimated to be 0.53 eV for Rh-1
   and 0.71 eV for Au-1, corresponding to a hopping rate between adjacent
   moire cells of similar to 10(3) s(-1) and similar to 1 s(-1) at 298 K,
   respectively. The consequences of different hopping rates to cluster
   nucleation have been explored by performing Monte Carlo-based
   statistical analysis, which suggests that diffusing species other than
   adatoms need to be taken into account to develop an accurate description
   of cluster nucleation and growth on this surface. (C) 2013 AIP
