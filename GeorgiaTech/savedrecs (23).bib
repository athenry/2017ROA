Abstract = {{This paper presents a general dc-link voltage balancing control method
   for multilevel inverters based on a generalized space vector pulse width
   modulation (SVPWM) scheme, with no requirements for additional
   auxiliary-power circuits. The SVPWM scheme generates all the available
   switching states and switching sequences based on two simple mappings,
   and calculates the duty cycles simply as for a two-level SVPWM, thus
   independent of the level of the inverter. The optimal switching sequence
   and optimal duty cycles for dc-link voltage balancing control are
   provided in the paper. Because all the measured signals are
   instantaneous values, the dc-link voltage balancing control method in
   the paper is suitable for any load without any assumption on the output
   current waveforms. The dc-link voltage balancing control in the paper is
   effective even when the capacitances of the dc-link capacitors of the
   multilevel inverter are not strictly equal or the voltage of the dc
   source of the multilevel inverter is fluctuating. Simulation results for
   a five-level inverter are given.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid water removal from a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell
   bipolar plate channel is critical for optimal performance and
   durability. A two-dimensional, two-phase computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) model was created to simulate water droplet formation and removal.
   The numerical domain consist of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) and channel.
   The polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) loading in the GDL was varied by
   changing the surface tension and contact angle. The effect of 10\%,
   15\%, and 20\% PTFE loading on the droplet detachment velocity and
   penetration pressure was studied. It was found that increasing the PTFE
   loading decreased the detachment velocity due to lower wetting at the
   GDL surface. However, increasing the PTFE loading had the consequence of
   raising the required capillary pressure to penetrate the GDL. This was
   due to initial spreading of the water below the GDL and the formation of
   local water paths, which was observed for the higher PTFE loadings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a rainfall-triggered landslide
   module within an existing physically based spatially distributed
   ecohydrologic model. The model, tRIBS-VEGGIE (Triangulated Irregular
   Networks-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator and Vegetation
   Generator for Interactive Evolution), is capable of a sophisticated
   description of many hydrological processes; in particular, the soil
   moisture dynamics are resolved at a temporal and spatial resolution
   required to examine the triggering mechanisms of rainfall-induced
   landslides. The validity of the tRIBS-VEGGIE model to a tropical
   environment is shown with an evaluation of its performance against
   direct observations made within the study area of Luquillo Forest.
   The newly developed landslide module builds upon the previous version of
   the tRIBS landslide component. This new module utilizes a numerical
   solution to the Richards' equation (present in tRIBS-VEGGIE but not in
   tRIBS), which better represents the time evolution of soil moisture
   transport through the soil column. Moreover, the new landslide module
   utilizes an extended formulation of the factor of safety (FS) to
   correctly quantify the role of matric suction in slope stability and to
   account for unsaturated conditions in the evaluation of FS.
   The new modeling framework couples the capabilities of the detailed
   hydrologic model to describe soil moisture dynamics with the infinite
   slope model, creating a powerful tool for the assessment of
   rainfall-triggered landslide risk.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new algorithm for multichannel blind deconvolution. Given
   the outputs of K linear time-invariant channels driven by a common
   source, we wish to recover their impulse responses without knowledge of
   the source signal. Abstractly, this problem amounts to finding a
   solution to an overdetermined system of quadratic equations. We show how
   we can recast the problem as solving a system of underdetermined linear
   equations with a rank constraint. Recent results in the area of low rank
   recovery have shown that there are effective convex relaxations to
   problems of this type that are also scalable computationally, allowing
   us to recover 100s of channel responses after a moderate observation
   time. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology with a
   numerical simulation of a passive ``noise imaging{''} experiment.}},

   substrate to be used for sensitive detection of an analyte. Here we

   the strong and reproducible hot spots formed at the corner sites of the
   AgNC in proximity to the AuMP surface, the new substrate showed high
   sensitivity and reproducibility. Using 1,4-benzenedithiol as a probe,
   the SERS enhancement factor of a typical ``AgNC on AuMP{''} substrate
   could reach a level as high as 4.7 x 10(7). In addition to the high
   sensitivity and reproducibility, the ``AgNC on AuMP{''} substrate also
   displayed very good stability. The potential use of the ``AgNC on

Abstract = {{Cardiac myofiber plays an important role in stress mechanism during
   heart beating periods. The orientation of myofibers decides the effects
   of the stress distribution and the whole heart deformation. It is
   important to image and quantitatively extract these orientations for
   understanding the cardiac physiological and pathological mechanism and
   for diagnosis of chronic diseases. Ultrasound has been wildly used in
   cardiac diagnosis because of its ability of performing dynamic and
   noninvasive imaging and because of its low cost. An extraction method is
   proposed to automatically detect the cardiac myofiber orientations from
   high frequency ultrasound images. First, heart walls containing
   myofibers are imaged by B-mode high frequency (>20 MHz) ultrasound
   imaging. Second, myofiber orientations are extracted from ultrasound
   images using the proposed method that combines a nonlinear anisotropic
   diffusion filter, Canny edge detector, Hough transform, and K-means
   clustering. This method is validated by the results of ultrasound data
   from phantoms and pig hearts.}},

Abstract = {{Designing a mechanically flexible catheter based volumetric ultrasonic
   imaging device for intravascular and intracardiac imaging is challenging
   due to small transducer area and limited number of cables. With a few
   parallel channels, synthetic phased array processing is necessary to
   acquire data from a large number of transducer elements. This increases
   the data collection time and hence reduces frame rate and causes
   artifacts due to tissue-transducer motion. Some of these drawbacks can
   be resolved by different array designs offered by CMUT-on-CMOS approach.
   We recently implemented a 2.1-mm diameter single chip 10 MHz dual ring
   CMUT-on-CMOS array for forward looking ICE with 64-transmit and
   56-receive elements along with associated electronics. These volumetric
   arrays have the small element size required by high operating
   frequencies and achieve sub mm resolution, but the system would be
   susceptible to motion artifacts. To enable real time imaging with high
   SNR, we designed novel arrays consisting of multiple defocused annular
   rings for transmit aperture and a single ring receive array. The annular
   transmit rings are utilized to act as a high power element by focusing
   to a virtual ring shaped line behind the aperture. In this case, image
   reconstruction is performed by only receive beamforming, reducing total
   required firing steps from 896 to 14 with a trade-off in image
   resolution. The SNR of system is improved more than 5 dB for the same
   frequency and frame rate as compared to the dual ring array, which can
   be utilized to achieve the same resolution by increasing the operating
   frequency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simple design code format for assigning design
   values of effective friction angle of clean sands from in-situ tests
   incorporating all sources of geotechnical uncertainty, including model
   uncertainty. New transformation models are proposed using a high-quality
   database of undisturbed sands. The quantitative characterization of
   uncertainty is pursued using a Bayesian hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   simulation framework. Design factors are calibrated using the posterior
   distributions output by the Bayesian framework. The effects of the
   aleatory and epistemic components of geotechnical uncertainty are
   discussed and assessed quantitatively. The paper concludes by
   demonstrating how to apply the results practically in geotechnical
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Two new conjugated polymers based on trifluoromethylated
   thieno{[}3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethyl carboxylate have been synthesized. The
   incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group at the 3-position of a
   thieno{[}3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethyl carboxylate unit has shown pronounced
   steric and electronic effects and significantly altered the optical and
   electrochemical properties of polymers. Trifluoromethylation reduces
   both the HOMO and the LUMO levels of new polymers compared with their
   non-trifluoromethylated counterparts. A relatively large trifluoromethyl
   group on the 3-position of thieno{[}3,4-b]thiophene can result in a
   significant twist of the conjugated main-chains from planarity and thus
   disrupt the effective conjugation in polymers with aryl repeating units.
   This steric hindrance can be relieved by using an alkynyl linker. Solar
   cell devices with PPDA-TTCF3 as a donor and PC61BM as an acceptor have
   been fabricated and evaluated.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{9747-9754}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional porous scaffolds are indispensable for regenerative
   medicine owing to their roles in providing physical supports and
   adjustable microenvironments for cells to attach, stretch, migrate,
   proliferate, and differentiate. In order to fulfill these roles, an
   ideal scaffold must possess certain properties such as appropriate pore
   size, porosity, and interconnectivity, among others. To this end, porous
   scaffolds with an inverse opal structure emerged. Unlike other scaffolds
   that are fabricated by stochastic porogen methods with random
   structures, an inverse opal scaffold is characterized by uniform and
   finely tunable pores and interconnecting windows, in addition to their
   highly reproducible structure among different batches of production. In
   this opinion article, we start with an analysis of the motivation for
   using the inverse opal scaffolds and an introduction to the fabrication
   method. We then highlight the advantages of such porous scaffolds over
   their counterparts with non-uniform structures through side-by-side
   comparisons. Finally, we offer some perspectives on the future
   directions, after discussions of two examples on the unique applications
   of the inverse opal scaffolds in regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Classical functional connectivity analysis of resting state fMRI data
   computed over the length of an entire scan implies stationarity for the
   signals and neglect changes in connectivity that occur on a much shorted
   scale. Recently, interest has been growing in dynamic analysis methods
   that can detect changes in connectivity on orders comparable with the
   cognitive process. Previous work showed that these changes in functional
   connectivity can be observed using classical sliding window techniques
   in human and animal subjects, although the hypothesis of stationarity on
   the data leads to suboptimal parcellations of the brain and to results
   that are dependent on the length of the chosen window. Recent techniques
   based on the wavelet and wavelet packet decomposition and clustering of
   resting state fMRI data overcome these obstacles with datadriven
   functional clusters based on temporal and spectral properties of the
   signals. The use of precise time-frequency techniques is important in
   the characterization of the dynamic properties of these clusters. The
   Stockwell transform offers good resolution in the time-frequency
   retaining at the same time the absolute phase information of the signal.
   In this work, we propose a study of the time frequency characteristics
   of wavelet-based functional clusters based on the Stockwell transform.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{160}},

Pages = {{F793-F797}},
Abstract = {{The effects of annealing time and humidity on fuel-cell performance and
   characteristics of solution cast Nafion membranes were investigated
   experimentally. Membranes cast from commercial Nafion dispersion were
   annealed at 120 degrees C for 10, 30 or 60 min in a dry or humid oven.
   Membrane electrode assemblies were made by applying a catalyst layer on
   cast and commercial membranes. Crystallinity, cell performance, membrane
   resistance, electrochemical active area, H-2 crossover current and
   ultimate tensile strength were measured. It has been found that all
   solution cast membranes perform similarly to the commercial membrane in
   fuel cells, except the membrane annealed for 10 min in the humid
   condition, which exhibited slightly worse performance at voltages below
   0.6 V. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of cast membranes annealed under
   dry conditions were found to be similar to commercial membrane; while
   XRD patterns for cast membranes annealed under humid conditions were
   found to be similar to un-annealed membrane. From tensile tests, it has
   been found that cast membranes annealed longer than 30 min in the dry
   condition have the similar strength as the commercial membrane. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Human-like motion is characterized by a straight or slightly curved
   trajectory with a smooth, bell-shaped end-point velocity. In order to
   achieve such a human-like point-to-point reaching motion with a robot,
   the best approach would be to create an actuation system that mimics key
   aspects of the human actuation system, specifically the nervous and
   musculoskeletal systems. The actuator type selected for the robot must
   be compliant and form force-generating subunits, much like human
   skeletal muscle. A key feature of human motion is the presence of motor
   variability and consequent errors in task performance. This suggests
   some form of randomness in the neuromuscular system. Harris and Wolpert
   first presented the concept of signal dependent noise (SDN), in which
   motor variability is caused by noise that is linearly proportional to
   the magnitude of the motor command. This can be modeled as
   multiplicative noise in the system. A straightforward implementation of
   SDN in a robot would require the introduction of a Gaussian noise
   generator; however, this is not preferable from a hardware perspective
   because it requires additional componentry. Further, no such extraneous
   noise generator has been found in the biological system. Therefore, an
   alternative, biologically inspired method of introducing SDN into the
   system was needed. Floating point quantization (FPQ), a popular
   numbering scheme in digital communications, appeared as a viable option
   which mimics aspects of Henneman's size principle of motor unit
   recruitment. This paper presents a non-uniform recruitment method for
   compliant actuator arrays. FPQ results in larger deviations from the
   original signal as amplitude increases, in the same manner as SDN.}},

Abstract = {{Signal and power integrity are crucial for ensuring high performance in
   high speed digital systems. As the operating frequency of digital
   systems increases, the power and ground bounce created by simultaneous
   switching noise (SSN) has become a limiting factor for the performance
   of these devices. SSN is caused by parasitic inductance that exists in
   the power delivery network (PDN), and voltage fluctuations on the power
   and ground rails can lead to reduced noise margins and can limit the
   maximum frequency of a digital device. A new PDN design has been
   suggested that achieves significantly reduced SSN {[}1] by replacing the
   power plane structure with a power transmission line (PTL). In this
   paper, a new power delivery scheme called Constant Voltage Power
   Transmission Line (CV-PTL) is shown to significantly reduce switching
   noise while also lowering power consumption. This concept has been
   demonstrated through theory, simulation, and measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic pressure ripple energy harvesters generate low-power
   electricity from off-resonance dynamic pressure excitation of
   piezoelectric elements. Improvements were made to hydraulic pressure
   ripple energy harvester prototype performance. Hydraulic systems
   inherently have a high energy intensity associated with the mean
   pressure and flow. Accompanying the mean pressure is dynamic pressure
   ripple, which is caused by the action of pumps and actuators. Pressure
   ripple is generally a deterministic source with a periodic time-domain
   behavior conducive to energy harvesting. An energy harvester prototype
   was designed for generating low-power electricity from pressure ripples.
   These devices generate low-power electricity from off-resonance dynamic
   pressure excitation. The power produced per volume of device was
   increased through decreasing the device size and adding an inductor to
   the system circuit. The prototype device utilizes a piezoelectric stack
   with high overall capacitance allowing for inductance matching without
   using a switching circuit. Initial testing with addition of an inductor
   produced over 2.1 mW, an increase of 78\% as compared to the device
   without the inductor. Two power output model simulations of a
   resistive-inductive circuit are analyzed: (1) ideal circuit case and (2)
   non-ideal circuit case with inductor internal resistance included.}},

Abstract = {{This article theoretically and experimentally studies deterministic and
   stochastic piezoelectric energy harvesting using a multilayer stack
   configuration for civil infrastructure system applications that involve
   large compressive loads, such as vehicular and foot loads acting upon
   pavements. Modeling of vibrational energy harvesters has been mostly
   focused on deterministic forms of mechanical excitation as in the
   typical case of harmonic excitation. In this paper, we present
   analytical and numerical modeling of piezoelectric energy harvesting
   from harmonic and random vibrations of multilayer piezoelectric stacks
   under axial compressive loading. The analytical electromechanical
   solution is based on the power spectral density (PSD) of random
   excitation and the voltage - to - pressure input frequency response
   function (FRF) of the harvester. The first one of the two numerical
   solution methods employs the Fourier series representation of the
   vibrational excitation history to solve the resulting ordinary
   differential equation (ODE), while the second method uses an
   Euler-Maruyama scheme to directly solve the governing electromechanical
   stochastic differential equation (SDE). The electromechanical model is
   validated through several experiments for a multilayer PZT-5H stack
   under harmonic and random excitations. The analytical predictions and
   numerical simulations exhibit very good agreement with the experimental
   measurements for a range of resistive loads and input excitation levels.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are light-emitting particles on the
   nanometer scale that have emerged as a new class of fluorescent labels
   for chemical analysis, molecular imaging, and biomedical diagnostics.
   Compared with traditional fluorescent probes, QDs have unique optical
   and electronic properties such as size-tunable light emission, narrow
   and symmetric emission spectra, and broad absorption spectra that enable
   the simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescence colors. QDs are
   also considerably brighter and more resistant to photobleaching than are
   organic dyes and fluorescent proteins. These properties are well suited
   for dynamic imaging at the single-molecule level and for multiplexed
   biomedical diagnostics at ultrahigh sensitivity. Here, we discuss the
   fundamental properties of QDs; the development of next-generation QDs;
   and their applications in bioanalytical chemistry, dynamic cellular
   imaging, and medical diagnostics. For in vivo and clinical imaging, the
   potential toxicity of QDs remains a major concern. However, the toxic
   nature of cadmium-containing QDs is no longer a factor for in vitro
   diagnostics, so the use of multicolor QDs for molecular diagnostics and
   pathology is probably the most important and clinically relevant
   application for semiconductor QDs in the immediate future.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical characteristics of organic aerosol (OA) are still poorly
   constrained. Here we present observation results of the degree of
   oxygenation of OA based on high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass
   spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS) measurements made at a coastal site in Hong
   Kong from late April to the end of May in 2011. Two foggy periods and
   one hazy period were chosen for detailed analysis to compare the changes
   in the degree of oxygenation of OA due to different processes. Using
   HR-ToF-AMS measured inorganic species as input, the Extended Aerosol
   Inorganic Model (E-AIM) predicted a fine-particle liquid water content
   (LWCfp) up to 85 mu g m(-3) during the foggy days. Particle
   concentration as measured by HR-ToF-AMS was up to 60 mu g m(-3) during
   the hazy days and up to 30 mu g m(-3) during the foggy days. The degree
   of oxygenation of OA, as indicated by several parameters including the
   fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectra (f(44)), the elemental ratio
   of oxygen to carbon (O:C), and the carbon oxidation state ((OS) over bar
   (c)), was evaluated against the odd oxygen (O-x) concentration, LWCfp,
   ionic strength (IS), and in situ pH (pH(is)). Observations suggest that
   the high concentration of OA (on average 11 mu g m(-3)) and the high
   degree of oxygenation (f(44) = 0.15, O:C=0.51, and (OS) over bar
   (c)=-0.31) during the hazy period were mainly due to gas-phase
   oxidation. During the foggy periods with low photochemical activities,
   the degree of oxygenation of OA was almost as high as that on the hazy
   days, and significantly higher than that during non-foggy/non-hazy days.
   However, the OA evolved quite differently in the two foggy periods. The
   first foggy period in late April saw a larger LWCfp and a lower O-x
   concentration and the OA were made up of similar to 20\% semi-volatile
   oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) as resolved by positive matrix
   factorization (PMF). In the second foggy period in mid-May, higher O-x
   concentration and lower LWCfp were observed, and the OA were found to
   contain > 50\% low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA). An
   examination of the particle characteristics (pH(is), IS, and LWCfp)
   suggests that partitioning may have been the dominating process through
   which oxygenated species were incorporated into the particle phase
   during the first foggy period, while oxidation in the aqueous phase
   dominated over gas-phase processes during the second foggy period.}},

   in tensile strength and a 54.40\% increase in strain were obtained with
   the addition of 1.5 wt\% of CGG. The bamboo fiber treated with CGG
   exhibited better thermal stability than the pure bamboo fiber. The
   surface morphologies of the unmodified and modified samples were
   analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed differences in the
   fine structure of fibers, showing coarser surfaces spread across the
   fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Stiffness and damping are conflicting requirements in many material
   systems. High stiffness is required in a wide range of structural
   components to provide sufficient robustness under demanding loading
   conditions. Simultaneously, a structure should be able to effectively
   mitigate shock and vibrations dynamically transmitted to it by the
   environment. While most conventional structures currently exhibit
   limited adaptability and damping capabilities, design strategies to
   simultaneously endow structural assemblies with high stiffness and high
   damping performance are proposed in this work. To this aim, a backbone
   structure suitable to meet stiffness requirements is combined with
   metamaterial inclusions able to provide fully-passive shock and
   vibration absorption. Viscoelastic resonant lattices with chiral
   topology are employed as inclusions, whose aim is to confine vibrational
   energy,pump it a way from the backbone structure,and dissipate it
   through viscoelastic damping. The lattices are composed by an
   elastomeric matrix with the desired chiral shape, and stiff resonating
   inclusions are inserted at nodal locations. Both finite element
   simulations and experimental tests demonstrate that periodic chiral
   assemblies give rise to wide frequency bandgaps. Low-frequency tuning of
   the assembly for effective suppression of the first resonant mode of a
   backbone structure represented by an aluminum box-beam is demonstrated
   both numerically and experimentally. The considered lightweight
   inclusion is a chiral matrix realized with castable rubber,featuring
   graded cylinder mass insertions. The proposed design methodology can be
   flexibly tailored to various frequency ranges and is applicable to both
   existing and novel structural components at different scales.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the scattering behavior of defects in
   composite plates. Scattering coefficients are of great importance for
   the estimation of wave-damage interaction, for the interpretation of
   recorded Lamb wave signals, and for the development of novel signal
   processing strategies. The anisotropy of composite laminates makes
   modeling of wave propagation and the numerical estimation of scattering
   coefficients particularly challenging. The paper studies numerical
   models of wave propagation in composites, and evaluates their predictive
   ability. These evaluations rely of full wave field measurements on
   selected composite plate specimens, through which information on
   dispersion and directionality of propagation are conveniently extracted.
   In addition, filtering in the frequency-wavenumber domain allows the
   extraction of scattered wave fields and the estimation of the scattering
   coefficients. Comparisons between numerical and experimental data
   highlight modeling challenges, illustrate mesh-driven directional
   propagation, and suggest an effective strategy for the estimation of the
   scattering coefficients through tests and FE modeling.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a geometric multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM),
   recently developed by the authors, is applied to the analysis of wave
   propagation in damaged plates. The proposed methodology is based on the
   formulation of both two-and three-dimensional multi-node (or multiscale)
   elements capable of describing small defects without resorting to
   excessive mesh refinements. Each multiscale element is equipped with a
   local mesh that is used to compute the interpolation functions of the
   element itself and to resolve the local fluctuations of the solution
   near the defect. The computed shape functions guarantee the continuity
   of the solution between multiscale and conventional elements. This
   allows using an undistorted discretization in the uniform portion of the
   domain while limiting the use of multiscale elements only in the
   vicinity of the defects. In this article the method is applied to
   evaluate the reflection coefficients due to cracks of different size and
   orientation in an otherwise homogeneous plate. Also, numerical
   simulations of wave-damage interaction are used to compute the
   scattering coefficients associated to three-dimensional defects in
   isotropic plates.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell tracking is a highly important subject. Current techniques
   based on nanoparticle-labeling, such as magnetic resonance imaging,
   fluorescence microscopy, and micro-computed tomography, are plagued by
   limitations including relatively low sensitivity or penetration depth,

   nanoparticles. Here we introduce a new class of contrast agents based on
   gold nanocages (AuNCs) with hollow interiors and porous walls to label
   human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for both in vitro and in vivo
   tracking using two-photon microscopy and photoacoustic microscopy. As
   demonstrated by the viability assay, the AuNCs showed negligible
   cytotoxicity under a reasonable dose, and did not alter the
   differentiation potential of the hMSCs into desired lineages. We were
   able to image the cells labeled with AuNCs in vitro for at least 28 days
   in culture, as well as to track the cells that homed to the tumor region
   in nude mice in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{A common use of mobile cranes is swinging a wrecking ball into
   structures to knock them down. This process is typically achieved by an
   experienced operator who moves the crane back and forth to increase the
   payload swing, thereby increasing the force at impact. This is a very
   challenging process, even for a highly-experienced crane operator. This
   paper analyzes a controller designed to aid the operator in achieving
   large-amplitude payload swings. The proposed controller is obtained by
   following a design method similar to input shaping. Usually, input
   shaping intercepts the operator's commands and modifies them so that
   they do not induce large oscillations. However, a similar method can be
   used to create commands that increase the oscillation. This paper
   illustrates the design process, then presents a series of operator
   studies that test the effectiveness of the controller in a small-scale
   wrecking application.}},

   convexity, is very fast. We then present results showing both a pair of

Abstract = {{Broadband, continuous-wave, electromagnetic induction sensors have been
   shown to perform well, but they usually use power inefficiently because
   of the power wasted in the linear amplifier used to drive the coils.
   Generally, much more power is dissipated in the power amplifier than in
   the coil in these systems. Methods for reducing this power are
   investigated using both linear and switched-mode amplifiers. Significant
   reductions in power dissipated by the linear amplifier are achieved by
   optimizing the signal used to drive the coil. Much greater reductions
   are achieved with the switched-mode amplifier using an optimized signal
   that has most of its energy in the desired frequencies for the sensor.
   Both of these techniques are shown to perform well in a prototype
   system.}},

Abstract = {{A broadband antenna system has been developed to use polarization
   diversity for ground penetrating radar (GPR) applications. The antenna
   system uses four, crossed, resistive-vee dipole (RVD) antennas operating
   bistaticly to measure the transmission and reception of multiple
   polarizations. The RVD was selected because it has low self clutter, low
   radar cross section and wideband performance. The RVD is linearly
   polarized, but other polarizations can be synthesized through the use of
   two orthogonal RVDs to transmit or receive orthogonal field components.
   The antenna system is able to distinguish rotationally symmetric and
   linear targets with its ability to transmit right-hand circularly
   polarized (RHCP) fields and receive both left-hand circularly polarized
   (LHCP) and RHCP scattered fields. A targets type can be identified by
   comparing the relative amplitudes of the received LHCP fields and RHCP
   fields. For example, the polarimetric antenna will be able to identify
   linear targets such as wires or pipes because linear targets scatter
   LHCP and RHCP fields in equal amounts. The configuration of the RVDs was
   optimized through simulation to achieve good circular polarization at
   close range and low coupling between the RVDs. Further simulations were
   performed which demonstrate that the polarimetric antenna provides
   sufficient information to identify linear targets from nonlinear ones,
   even at different target orientations. The polarimetric antenna was
   constructed and has been shown to also correctly detect and identify
   linear targets. Additional experiments revealed that the polarimetric
   antenna is effective for ground penetrating radar applications.}},

Abstract = {{The articular cartilage function is to allow the bones in a joint to
   move without causing excess friction and damage. When this cartilage
   becomes damaged, the supportive and lubricating mechanisms break down,
   leading to injuries which can be permanent or take extended periods of
   time for recovery. Because of its importance in general health and body
   mobility, the unique lubricating properties of cartilage have been
   studied for many decades. Many current theories exist to characterize
   the biphasic and triphasic nature of cartilage; however, an important
   reason that cartilage is so effective is its viscoelastic nature, which
   allows elastic and dissipative mechanisms to exist simultaneously. It is
   desired to derive the material properties of cartilage in order to
   better understand its mechanical effectiveness. Utilizing a CETR-UMT-3
   Tribometer, stress relaxation experiments will be performed on freshly
   harvested equine cartilage plugs that remain hydrated in a fluid bath.
   Viscoelastic models, such as the Prony series and fractional derivative,
   are applied to the experimental data to determine the storage and loss
   moduli of the sample explants. The storage and loss information
   characterizes the mechanical response of cartilage, and provides insight
   into the effectiveness and longevity of biological joints. A comparison
   will be made between joints that experience similar loads, but undergo
   different relative motions, to determine if the mechanical properties of
   cartilage are tailored to joint function. Osteoarthritic cartilage will
   also be explored for deviations in viscoelastic behavior compared to
   healthy cartilage. Ultimately, it is hoped that a viscoelastic
   characterization of articular cartilage will lead to insight into the
   precursors of osteoarthritis, more advanced prosthetics, and biomimetric
   applications such as the integration of flexible surfaces in mechanical
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{As the power to weight ratio demand on rotordynamic systems increases,
   susceptibility to transverse fatigue cracking of the shaft increases as
   well. The ability to detect cracks in an early stage of progression is
   imperative for minimizing off-line repair time. A vibration monitoring
   system proposed prior is developed herein, employing the 2X harmonic
   response component of the rotor tilt as a signature indicating a
   transverse shaft crack. To effectively capture the 2X response, the
   crack model must include the local nature of the crack, the depth of the
   crack, and the stiffness asymmetry inducing the gravity-forced 2X
   harmonic response. The transfer matrix technique is well-suited to
   incorporate these crack attributes due to its modular nature. Two
   transfer matrix models are proposed to predict the 2X harmonic response.
   The first model applies local crack flexibility coefficients determined
   using the strain energy release rate, while the second incorporates the
   crack as a rectangular notch to emulate a manufactured crack used in the
   experiments. Analytic results are then compared to experimental
   measurement of the rotor tilt gleaned from an overhung rotor test rig
   originally designed to test seal face dynamics. The test rig is
   discussed, and experimental 2X harmonic amplitudes of the rotor tilt are
   provided for shafts containing manufactured cracks of depths between
   zero and 40 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Georgia Institute of Technology researchers developed an idle detection
   and warning notification system that features Global Positioning
   System-based real-time tracking and a web-based user interface. Four
   hundred and eighty buses in the Cobb County (Georgia) School District
   were equipped with the idle detection system, and the research team
   provided bus dispatchers with a web-based system to track vehicle
   activity and provide notification of idle events exceeding 5 min. The
   idle detection and warning notification system can differentiate idling
   with engine on from key-on events with engine off, an important
   capability that sets it apart from previous systems that only detected
   key-on events. Idle reductions were monitored, and emissions and fuel
   savings were evaluated with the Environmental Protection Agency's MOVES
   (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator) model. The idle reduction that
   resulted from implementing the system was statistically significant-more
   than 6 min of idle reduction per bus per day. Greater idle reduction
   could be achieved with more stringent implementation of the system. The
   anti-idle program reduced total annual emissions of criteria pollutants
   (oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide) by 1.82
   tons and annual emissions of carbon dioxide by 533 tons. Implementation
   throughout the school district would conserve 6,400 gal of diesel fuel.
   Approximately 41,100 children riding the buses or attending schools
   served by the buses were positively affected by the idle reduction
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The gusset plates typically employed for connecting steel members to
   each other in the lateral load resisting systems are always an important
   part of truss bridges and braced frames. We can recognize that when
   considering the tragic collapse of the I-35W Minnesota highway bridge on
   August 1, 2007, the failure of gusset plates in particular leaded to
   destroy the whole structure. Many researchers have been increasingly
   interested in the adequate design of such critical panel points as
   motivated by this accident. In order to follow up on this research
   trend, this study is intended to examine design strength models on the
   basis of feasible failure patterns for the gusset plates, thereby
   calculating their strength capacities. In addition, the inelastic
   behavior of existing gusset plates is investigated through a series of
   detailed finite element (FE) analyses, and then strength models
   specified in the current design specifications are evaluated based on
   the FE analysis results. According to individual failure modes, safety
   and load rating factors deliberately applied to gusset plate design are
   finally assured by observing the distribution of plastic stresses on the
   gusset plate.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites composed of diblock copolymer/ferroelectric nanoparticles

   (NPs) within diblock copolymer nanodomains via judicious surface
   modification of ferroelectric NPs. Ferroelectric barium titanate
   (BaTiO3) NPs with different sizes that are permanently capped with
   polystyrene chains (i.e., PS-functionalized BaTiO(3)NPs) were first
   synthesized by exploiting amphiphilic unimolecular star-like
   poly(acrylic acid)-block-polystyrene (PAA-bPS) diblock copolymers as
   nanoreactors. Subsequently, PS-functionalized BaTiO3 NPs were
   preferentially sequestered within PS nanocylinders in the linear
   cylinder-forming polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA)
   diblock copolymer upon mixing the BaTiO3 NPs with PS-b-PMMA. The use of
   PS-b-PMMA diblock copolymers, rather than traditional homopolymers,
   offers the opportunity for controlling the spatial organization of
   PS-functionalized BaTiO3 NPs in the PS-b-PMMA/BaTiO3 NP nanocomposites.
   Selective solvent vapor annealing was utilized to control the nanodomain
   orientation in the nanocomposites. Vertically oriented PS nanocylinders
   containing PS-functionalized BaTiO3 NPs were yielded after exposing the
   PS-b-PMMA/BaTiO3 NP nanocomposite thin film to acetone vapor, which is a
   selective solvent for PMMA block. The dielectric properties of
   nanocomposites in the microwave frequency range were investigated. The
   molecular weight of PS-b-PMMA and the size of BaTiO3 NPs were found to
   exert an apparent influence on the dielectric properties of the
   resulting nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{At the microscale, cantilever vibrations depend not only on the
   microstructure's properties and geometry but also on the properties of
   the surrounding medium. In fact, when a microcantilever vibrates in a
   fluid, the fluid offers resistance to the motion of the beam. The study
   of the influence of the hydrodynamic force on the microcantilever's
   vibrational spectrum can be used to either (1) optimize the use of
   microcantilevers for chemical detection in liquid media or (2) extract
   the mechanical properties of the fluid. The classical method for
   application (1) in gas is to operate the microcantilever in the dynamic
   transverse bending mode for chemical detection. However, the performance
   of microcantilevers excited in this standard out-of-plane dynamic mode
   drastically decreases in viscous liquid media. When immersed in liquids,
   in order to limit the decrease of both the resonant frequency and the
   quality factor, alternative vibration modes that primarily shear the
   fluid (rather than involving motion normal to the fluid/ beam interface)
   have been studied and tested: these include in-plane vibration modes
   (lateral bending mode and elongation mode). For application (2), the
   classical method to measure the rheological properties of fluids is to
   use a rheometer. To overcome the limitations of this classical method,
   an alternative method based on the use of silicon microcantilevers is
   presented. The method, which is based on the use of analytical equations
   for the hydrodynamic force, permits the measurement of the complex shear
   modulus of viscoelastic fluids over a wide frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional chemically amplified resists have several issues that can
   potentially limit their capability for sub-40 nm imaging. One of the
   major issues at this size scale is that the mechanical strength of
   positive tone CARs limits the amount of stress they can withstand during
   development, rinse, and drying, thus leading to problems with pattern
   collapse due to the high capillary forces generated during drying. This
   problem is exasperated by the fact that linear polymers show
   dramatically reduced modulus at sub-50 nm features sizes. To improve on
   this problem, we have made a positive tone resist based on network
   depolymerization of molecular resists. The resist thermally cross-links
   after being spin cast into thin film form through reactions between
   vinyl ether groups and carboxylic acid groups. By cross-linking the
   resist to form a dense three dimensional polymer network, the mechanical
   strength of the resist is greatly improved compared to linear polymers.
   The network is depolymerized using an acid catalyzed reaction to create
   development contrast that allows for patterning of the resist via
   development in either aqueous base or organic solvent. One drawback of
   the current resist design is that the free carboxylic acids on the
   resist molecule appear to react in solution at room temperature with
   both the vinyl ether groups on adjacent molecules and with any added
   base quencher. These reactions cause reduced effectiveness of the base
   quencher and produce a noticeable resist shelf life problem. Despite
   these limitations, the material was used to compare the effect of
   development in aqueous base versus organic solvent. The resist
   formulated in this work showed a DUV sensitivity of 7 mJ/cm(2) and a
   contrast of 5.2 for development in either solvent or aqueous base. Under
   100 keV e-beam imaging, the material showed 40 nm resolution for both
   development types. In standard 0.26 N TMAH, the dose-to-size was 84 mu
   C/cm(2) with 3 sigma LER of 14.2 nm. Using methyl isobutyl ketone for
   organic solvent development, the dose-to-size was 104 mu C/cm(2) with 3
   sigma LER of 7.4 nm.}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative lithography technique, directed self-assembly (DSA) of
   block copolymers has shown to be promising for next generation high
   resolution patterning. PS-b-PMMA has been widely studied for its use as
   a block copolymer in directed self-assembly and has demonstrated
   patterned features down to size scales on the order of 20 nm pitch.
   However, due to the modest chi value for PS-b-PMMA (chi=0.038), this 20
   nm feature pitch representes roughly the limiting capability of
   PS-b-PMMA. To achieve smaller pitch features, new block copolymers with
   higher chi values must be developed for use in DSA lithography. Here,
   poly(styrene)-b-poly(hydroxyehtylmethacrylate) or PS-b-PHEMS is
   introduced as one possible such high chi polymer. PS-b-PHEMA with
   controlled Mw and PDI was successfully synthesized via ATRP and fully
   characterized by NMR, GPC and FTIR. As a first demonstration of sub-20
   nm pitch capability in PS-b-PHEMA, a 15 nm pitch size lamella structure
   in PS-b-PHEMA is shown. PS-b-PHEMA has good thermal stability, allowing
   it to be rapidly annealed thermally. PS-b-PHEMA also is shown to have
   improved etch contrast between the two blocks as compared to PS-b-PMMA.
   The chi value for PS-b-PHEMA is estimated to be 0.37 based on
   experimental pitch scaling studies, which is almost 10 times of the chi.

Abstract = {{Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) could enable high
   resolution patterning beyond the capabilities of current optical
   lithography methods via pitch multiplication from lower resolution
   primary lithographic patterns. For example, DSA could enable dense
   feature production with pitches less than 80 nm from patterns generated
   using 193 nm exposure tools without the need for double patterning or
   other schemes. According to theory, microphase separation of diblock
   copolymers occurs when the critical condition that chi N>10.5 is met
   while the pitch of the resulting polymer features scale as similar to
   N-2/3, where chi is the Flory Huggins interaction parameter and N is the
   total degree of polymerization for the diblock copolymer. In order to
   generate patterns with smaller pitches, N must be decreased while
   maintaining a chi N>10.5 to allow for phase separation. This requires
   utilization of polymers with higher chi values as N is decreased.
   Current materials, such as PS-b-PMMA, exhibit a relatively low chi value
   of similar to 0.04, which limits the practical pitch of DSA line-space
   patterns produced using PS-b-PMMA to approximately 20 nm. In this paper,
   we investigate alternative materials, namely
   poly(styrene)-b-poly(hydroxystyrene) (PS-b-PHOST), which exhibits a high
   chi value via hydrogen bonding interactions that can allow for
   production of sub-20nm pitch DSA patterns. In order to utilize any
   diblock copolymer for DSA, a neutral underlayer and a method for
   annealing the block copolymer are required. Here, a random copolymer,
   poly(styrene-co-hydroxystyrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate), is developed
   and reported for use as a neutral underlayer for PS-b-PHOST.
   Furthermore, a solvent annealing method for PS-b-PHOST is developed and
   optimized using ethyl acetate to allow for uniform microphase separation
   of PS-b-PHOST.}},

Abstract = {{A 10\% batch-to-batch variation in molecular weight for a low
   polydispersity block copolymer (BCP) used for DSA lithography could
   result in more than a 6\% change in critical dimension (CD). Therefore,
   there is a strong motivation and need to develop and understand methods
   for fine-tuning the domain size of DSA BCPs to meet the CD and pitch
   specifications that will be required for practical implementation of DSA
   processes. This study investigates two methods of fine-tuning the domain
   size of a specific batch of BCP through blending of the BCP with another
   polymer, either 1. a set of similar homopolymers (HPs) or 2. a similar
   BCP of different molecular weight. Each method was investigated and
   compared using a coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation. For
   BCP-HP blends, the domain size increases as the amount of HP increases
   because the HPs tend to slightly swell the BCP domains. A design
   heuristic was developed for guiding the determination of how much HP to
   add to obtain a desired pitch. For blends of different molecular weight
   BCPs, two different scaling regimes were identified; one regime is
   majority large chains and the other regime is majority small chains.
   Based on the simulation results, the domain scaling can be mapped across
   the full range of blends by simply measuring three points: the pure
   small chain domain size, the pure large chain domain size, and a 50/50
   blend of the small and large chains. Comparing the two different
   blending methodologies, BCP blending with other BCPs is a more versatile
   approach because it can be used to either increase or decrease the
   domain size of a base BCP while HP blending can only increase the domain
   size. HP blending is also potentially problematic because the HPs tends
   to aggregate in the middle of each block's half domain which can have a
   significant effect on CD uniformity due to the strong effect of local
   variations in the concentration of the HP and local variations in HP
   conformation. The use of BCP blends with other BCPs should be more
   favorable from a CD uniformity perspective because this approach is much
   less susceptible to initial local fluctuations than HP blends because
   all BCPs go to the A-B interface. The coarse grained molecular dynamics
   simulation is well suited for comparisons such as this and can produce
   design rules that are needed for experimental implementation of polymer
   blending with BCPs to tune domain size.}},

Abstract = {{A model has been developed for the simulation of block copolymer (BCP)
   directed self-assembly (DSA) based on a coarse grained polymer model
   that anneals using molecular dynamics. The model uses graphics
   processing units (GPUs) to perform the calculations; this combined with
   the coarse graining means simulations times approach the speed of other
   more commonly used simulation techniques for BCPs. The model is unique
   in how it treats the pure phase blocks interactions with themselves
   (i.e. A-A and B-B interactions) and their interactions with each other.
   This allows for simulations that can potentially more accurately capture
   the differences between the properties of each block such as density and
   cohesive energy. The model is fully described and used to examine some
   of the issues that are unique to DSA lithographic applications of BCPs.
   We describe a method to calculate chi for the off-lattice MD system
   based on observation of the order-disorder transitions (ODT) for
   different degrees of polymerization N. The model is used to examine the
   transient, complex, non-classical morphologies that can occur through
   film thickness during a DSA process. During the phase separation process
   from a mixed initial state, the BCPs first locally phase separate to
   form small aggregate type structures. These aggregates then coalesce
   into larger features that approach the size of the equilibrium domain.
   These features then shift to match the guiding pattern on the underlayer
   followed by the slow elimination of defects. We also studied how the
   guiding patterns work in chemo-epitaxy DSA. The guiding patterns have a
   strong immediate effect on the BCP film nearest the interface and induce
   locally aligned self-assembly. Over time, this induced pattern tends to
   propagate up through the thickness of the film until the film is
   uniformly aligned to the guiding pattern. We also clearly see that the
   observed morphology at the top of the film gives no indication of the
   morphology through the depth, especially during the transient portions
   of the self-assembly process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses two fundamental issues: (1) the connection between
   block copolymer polydispersity (as measured by a polydisperisty index
   (PDI)) and pattern LER/LWR limits and (2) the connection between block
   copolymer chi N value and pattern LER/LWR limits. In this work, we have
   used coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of BCP DSA to
   study the effect of block copolymer PDI on DSA properties including
   LER/LWR and patterning capability. It is observed that as PDI increases
   from 1 to values of similar to 1.3, there is little effect on pattern
   LER/LWR, and as PDI increases above similar to 1.3 the LER/LWR increases
   slowly with increasing PDI. This suggests that LER/LWR concerns are not
   a major determinant in terms of specifying block copolymer PDI
   requirements for DSA processes. Concerning chi N and LER/LWR, there is a
   sharp increase in roughness for chi N<30. Because of the sharp increase
   at such low chi N values, it is unlikely that BCP DSA processes for
   semiconductor manufacturing will be able to operate at low chi N values
   even though microphase separation still occurs at these low chi N
   values.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium alloys are used in a wide variety of aerospace, energy,
   industrial and biomedical applications, among other reasons, due to
   their superior properties. These properties are highly dependent of
   materials microstructure, i.e. texture, dislocation density and slip
   system activity. Therefore, in order to be able to design materials with
   certain properties it is crucial an understanding of the deformation
   process in terms of microstructural parameters. Microstructure evolution
   in warm rolled commercially pure titanium was investigated by means of
   X-ray diffraction and modeled with a crystal plasticity self-consistent
   scheme. Texture measurements and peak profile analysis were used to
   characterize the deformation texture and evaluate the relative activity
   of the various slips systems activated during the deformation process.
   The peak profile analysis data and the self-consistent predictions of
   texture evolution showed a good agreement with the experimental
   deformation texture evolution.}},

Abstract = {{On an onboard cone-beam CT (CBCT) system, the poly-energetic beam
   generated by current commercial x-ray tubes hardens as it penetrates the
   object. The beam-hardening effect results in CT image artifacts of up to
   100 HU, especially around dense objects (e.g. bones). We propose to
   insert a half-blocked beam filter between x-ray source and object, such
   that any ray passing through the object is filtered once from one of the
   opposite directions in a single full scan. The conventional data
   processing of dual energy imaging is then applied to obtain material
   decomposition as well as CT images with no beam-hardening artifacts. In
   this preliminary study, we demonstrate the method feasibility using
   computer simulations. The beam filter thickness is optimized to balance
   the CT number accuracy and the noise level on the reconstructed images
   via both analytical calculation and measurement of image noise. A
   calibration phantom is designed to obtain the decomposition function for
   energy selective imaging by projection measurements without the
   knowledge of x-ray spectrum and detector response. Using the optimized
   beam blocker and the calibration phantom, we simulate the data
   acquisition using scan settings of a commercial CBCT system. Our
   proposed approach significantly suppresses beam-hardening artifacts and
   reduces the image error from 65 HU to 9 HU in the selected regions of
   interest on a head phantom. The method also successfully decomposes bone
   and soft tissue, with 95\% accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass burning, the largest global source of elemental carbon (EC) and
   primary organic carbon (OC), is strongly associated with many subjects
   of great scientific concern, such as secondary organic aerosol and brown
   carbon which exert important effects on the environment and on climate
   in particular. This study investigated the relationships between
   levoglucosan and other biomass burning tracers (i.e., water soluble
   potassium and mannosan) based on both ambient samples collected in
   Beijing and source samples. Compared with North America and Europe,
   Beijing was characterized by high ambient levoglucosan concentrations
   and low winter to summer ratios of levoglucosan, indicating significant
   impact of biomass burning activities throughout the year in Beijing.
   Comparison of levoglucosan and water soluble potassium (K+) levels
   suggested that it was acceptable to use K+ as a biomass burning tracer
   during summer in Beijing, while the contribution of fireworks to K+
   could be significant during winter. Moreover, the levoglucosan to K+
   ratio was found to be lower during the typical summer period (0.21 +/-
   0.16) compared with the typical winter period (0.51 +/- 0.15).
   Levoglucosan correlated strongly with mannosan (R-2 = 0.97) throughout
   the winter and the levoglucosan to mannosan ratio averaged 9.49 +/-
   1.63, whereas levoglucosan and mannosan exhibited relatively weak
   correlation (R-2 = 0.73) during the typical summer period when the
   levoglucosan to mannosan ratio averaged 12.65 +/- 3.38. Results from
   positive matrix factorization (PMF) model analysis showed that about
   50\% of the OC and EC in Beijing were associated with biomass burning
   processes. In addition, a new source identification method was developed
   based on the comparison of the levoglucosan to K+ ratio and the
   levoglucosan to mannosan ratio among different types of biomass. Using
   this method, the major source of biomass burning aerosol in Beijing was
   suggested to be the combustion of crop residuals, while the contribution
   from softwood burning was also non-negligible, especially in winter.}},

Abstract = {{Alkyl chains are often attached to the periphery of semiconductor
   molecules to impart solubility and they represent a pervasive structural
   element in solution processable, organic photovoltaics (OPV). It is
   important to understand the effects of such substitutions on the
   morphology and performance of organic solar cells. This investigation
   focuses on determining structure-property correlations in OPV devices
   constructed with small-molecule, solution processable electron donors
   based on benzothiadiazole-dithienopyrrole, mixed with the electron
   acceptor PCBM. Two donor molecules with the same opto-electronic
   molecular properties but differing alkyl substituents - without (BD) or
   with (BD6) hexyl side chains - are studied. The resulting device data
   for fabricated solar cells, across a range of processing conditions, is
   compared to thin-film morphology, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and
   molecular dynamics simulations. Two device states of higher and lower
   performance, depending on the casting solvent, are obtained for the
   molecule without the side chains (BD); both states have amorphous
   mesoscale structure, but show subtle differences in the nanoscale phase
   separation. In contrast, for the molecule with side chains (BD6) devices
   have highly variable reproducibility and middling efficiency and
   photocurrent. The BD6 donor exhibits lower miscibility with PCBM, which
   correlates with the formation of a donor-enriched layer on the surface
   of the solar cell.}},

Title = {{An Improved Parametric Relaxation Approach to Blood Flow Signal
   Estimation with Single-Ensemble Samples in Color Flow Imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{309-317}},
Abstract = {{In color flow imaging, it is a challenging work to accurately extract
   blood flow information from ultrasound Doppler echoes dominated by
   strong clutter components. Conventional non-parametric estimators
   usually cause flow velocity estimation biases since clutter rejection
   filters often distort parts of blood flows or fail to suppress clutter
   adequately. In this paper, a parametric estimation framework called
   relaxation (RELAX) is proposed to directly extract blood flow
   information from raw ultrasound Doppler signals. RELAX constructs an
   exponential model to approximate single-ensemble ultrasound Doppler
   echoes and solves for its parameters in a decoupled manner The principal
   Doppler frequencies of the clutter and the blood flow obtained by RELAX
   are independent of the corresponding phase shifts. A parameter selection
   algorithm based on the energy ratio is proposed to determine the number
   of principal components. A series of simulations shows that the proposed
   RELAX approach can achieve accurate velocity estimation of blood flow.
   The mean overall errors obtained by RELAX are 30\% lower compared to
   those obtained using state-of-the-art non-parametric methods using
   eigen-decomposition based filters. RELAX also eliminates the effect
   caused by white noise and achieves an extremely low estimation variance
   of low-velocity blood flow (< 15cm/s) compared to those obtained using
   competing methods. Clinical experiment results show that the RELAX
   method leads to the highest blood flow energy and blood-to-clutter
   energy ratio among those obtained using the discussed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Seeking optimal solutions has been one of important tasks in engineering

   aggregating diverse criteria into one single objective function subject

   conflicting objectives. Such joint optimization of multiple competing
   optimization problems is very difficult, if not impossible, to be

   self-assembled into network-like morphologies via dewetting at the

   high photoluminescence (PL) as a result of successfully transferring the
   amorphous conjugated P3HT chains in the PI-PS-P3HT triblock copolymer
   from the solution state to the solid state. A model was proposed to
   illustrate the supramolecular organization of the PI-PS-P3HT monolayer.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a hydrophobic
   conjugated block copolymer at the air-water interface, from which the
   conjugated polymer-based monolayer with highly efficient PL formed by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method to extract depth from motion, texture
   and intensity. We first analyze the depth map to extract a set of depth
   cues. Then, based on these depth cues, we process the colored reference
   video, using texture, motion, luminance and chrominance content, to
   extract the depth map. The processing of each channel in the Y
   CRCB-color space is conducted separately. We tested this approach on
   different video sequences with different monocular properties. The
   results of our simulations show that the extracted depth maps generate a
   3D video with quality close to the video rendered using the ground truth
   depth map. We report objective results using 3VQM and subjective
   analysis via comparison of rendered images. Furthermore, we analyze the
   savings in bitrate as a consequence of eliminating the need for two
   video codecs, one for the reference color video and one for the depth
   map. In this case, only the depth cues are sent as a side information to
   the color video.}},

Journal = {{ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{176-180}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this project was to document the state of wheelchair
   cushions after everyday use by identifying signs of wear, fatigue, and
   failure. Visual inspection was done on 202 wheelchair cushions with
   average and median ages of 2.7 and 2 years, respectively. Most cushions
   were deemed to be ``clean{''} and the proportion did not change across
   age groups. A high proportion of cushion covers showed signs of wear
   with damage to fabric and seams being most prevalent. Foam cushions
   showed more signs of wear than viscous fluid or air cushions. More than
   60\% of foam cushions showed signs of permanent deformation, and in
   nearly half, the foam exhibited granulation or brittleness. About 15\%
   of the bladders used in viscous fluid or air cushions exhibited cracks
   or breaks in the material. In conclusion, a visual inspection of
   wheelchair cushions showed that most cushions appeared clean and were in
   good repair over a wide range of ages and usage patterns. While
   documenting signs of wear after use can help inform interventions and
   monitoring, research is needed to document changes in performance of
   wheelchair cushions overtime as a means to develop better replacement
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Early detection of prostate cancer is critical in maximizing the
   probability of successful treatment. Current systematic biopsy approach
   takes 12 or more randomly distributed core tissue samples within the
   prostate and can have a high potential, especially with early disease,
   for a false negative diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to
   determine the accuracy of a 3D ultrasound-guided biopsy system. Testing
   was conducted on prostate phantoms created from an agar mixture which
   had embedded markers. The phantoms were scanned and the 3D ultrasound
   system was used to direct the biopsy. Each phantom was analyzed with a
   CT scan to obtain needle deflection measurements. The deflection
   experienced throughout the biopsy process was dependent on the depth of
   the biopsy target. The results for markers at a depth of less than 20
   mm, 20-30 mm, and greater than 30 mm were 3.3 mm, 4.7 mm, and 6.2 mm,
   respectively. This measurement encapsulates the entire biopsy process,
   from the scanning of the phantom to the firing of the biopsy needle.
   Increased depth of the biopsy target caused a greater deflection from
   the intended path in most cases which was due to an angular incidence of
   the biopsy needle. Although some deflection was present, this system
   exhibits a clear advantage in the targeted biopsy of prostate cancer and
   has the potential to reduce the number of false negative biopsies for
   large lesions.}},

Abstract = {{The development of accurate force fields is vital for predicting
   adsorption in porous materials. Previously, we introduced a first
   principles-based transferable force field for CO2 adsorption in
   siliceous zeolites (Fang et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2012, 116, 10692). In
   this study, we extend our approach to CO2 adsorption in cationic
   zeolites which possess more complex structures. Na-exchanged zeolites
   are chosen for demonstrating the approach. These methods account for
   several structural complexities including Al distribution, cation
   positions and cation mobility, all of which are important for predicting
   adsorption. The simulation results are validated with high-resolution
   experimental measurements of isotherms and microcalorimetric heats of
   adsorption on well-characterized materials. The choice of
   first-principles method has a significant influence on the ability of
   force fields to accurately describe CO2-zeolite interactions. The PBE-D2
   derived force field, which performed well for CO2 adsorption in
   siliceous zeolites, does not do so for Na-exchanged zeolites; the PBE-D2
   method overestimates CO2 adsorption energies on multi-cation sites that
   are common in cationic zeolites with low Si/Al ratios. In contrast, a
   force field derived from the DFT/CC method performed well. Agreement was
   obtained between simulation and experiment not only for LTA-4A on which
   the force field fitting is based, but for other two common adsorbents,
   NaX and NaY.}},

Abstract = {{Power system state estimation has been used to filter raw measurement
   data, providing reliable and accurate real time model, i.e. the
   operating conditions of the system, mathematical model and network
   topology. Recently, as the power system operation and control focuses on
   the distribution system (e.g., Smart Grid) with high penetration of
   distributed renewable generators and various inverter-based smart
   devices, the modern power system requires a new approach of state
   estimation that can adapt to dynamic conditions of grids. We propose a
   new state estimation approach for this system that operates
   autonomously. The autonomous state estimation consists of two concepts:
   1) a robotic preprocessor that autonomously creates the network
   connectivity, states and measurement model and 2) state estimation. This
   paper applies the autonomous state estimation to extract the real-time
   model of Smart Grid and then to use the real-time model to perform
   diagnostic of the system. First the real-time model is validated with
   standard state estimation procedures, i.e. chi-square test for expected
   errors in the state estimates and confidence level of the validity of
   the real-time model. The validated real-time model is eventually used to
   assess whether the system operates within operating limits and to issue
   diagnostic in case system components operate near limits or exceed

   proposed diagnostic system using the Smart Grid Energy Systems, which
   include a PV system, a programmable load that can emulate the daily load

   1) the standby mode, 2) the inverter mode, and 3) the charger mode. The
   proposed approach is tested and verified with the Smart Grid Energy
   Systems, and proper test results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The energy storage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can be utilized by Smart
   Grid through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) that allows EVs to feed energy stored
   in their batteries back to the grid as needed. Combining V2G and the

   system called EV energy network. The main idea of this paper focus on
   how to schedule and allocate energy from energy sources to places where
   energy is needed. The features of energy route in EV energy network are
   analyzed and a greedy algorithm based on the hypergraph is presented.

   that WSNs have inherent causes of inefficiency due to the manner in
   which their sensors take measurements. We then use ideas from source

   show that the sensing functionality of a WSN with sensors that take

Abstract = {{Fluorescent microscopy has become an essential tool to study biological
   molecules, pathways and events in living cells, tissues and animals.
   Meanwhile even the most advanced confocal microscopy can only yield
   optical resolution approaching Abbe diffraction limit of similar to 200
   nm. This is still larger than many subcellular structures, which are too
   small to be resolved in detail. These limitations have driven the
   development of super-resolution optical imaging methodologies over the
   past decade.
   In stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, the excitation focus
   is overlapped by an intense doughnut-shaped spot to instantly de-excite
   markers from their fluorescent state to the ground state by stimulated
   emission. This effectively eliminates the periphery of the Point Spread
   Function (PSF), resulting in a narrower focal region, or
   super-resolution. Scanning a sharpened spot through the specimen renders
   images with sub-diffraction resolution. Multi-color STED imaging can
   present important structural and functional information for
   protein-protein interaction.
   In this work, we presented a two-color, synchronization-free STED
   microscopy with a Ti:Sapphire oscillator. The excitation wavelengths
   were 532nm and 635nm, respectively. With pump power of 4.6 W and sample
   irradiance of 310 mW, we achieved super-resolution as high as 71 nm.
   Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) proteins were imaged with our
   two-color CW STED for co-localization analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A 1-gigawatt space solar power satellite using a large array of
   individually pointable optical elements is identified as the key mass
   element of a large scale space solar power architecture using the Space
   Power Grid concept. The proposed satellite design enables a significant
   increase in specific power. Placed in sun-synchronous dynamic orbits
   near 2000km altitude, these satellites can maintain the constant solar
   view requirement of GEO-based architectures, while greatly reducing the
   beaming distance required, decreasing the required antenna size and in
   turn the overall system mass. The satellite uses an array of
   individually pointable optical elements (which we call a Mirasol
   Concentrator Array) to concentrate solar energy to an intensified feed
   target that feeds into the main heater of the spacecraft, similar
   conceptually to heliostat arrays. The spacecraft then utilizes Brayton
   cycle conversion to take advantage of non-linear power level scaling in
   order to generate high specific power values. Using phase array
   antennas, the power is then beamed at a millimeter wave frequency of
   220GHz down to Earth. The design of the Mirasol concentrator system will
   be described and a detailed mass estimation of the system is developed.
   The technical challenges of pointing the elements and maintaining
   constant solar view is investigated. An end-to-end efficiency analysis
   is performed. Subsystem designs for the spacecraft are outlined. A
   detailed mass budget is refined to reflect reductions in uncertainty of
   the spacecraft mass, particularly in the Mirasol system. One of the key
   mass drivers of the spacecraft is the active thermal control system. The
   design of a lightweight thermal control system utilizing graphene sheets
   is also detailed.}},

Abstract = {{This is an update of the Space Power Grid architecture for space-based
   solar power with an improved design of the collector/converter link, the
   primary heater and the radiator of the active thermal control system.
   The Space Power Grid offers an evolutionary approach towards
   TeraWatt-level Space-based solar power. The use of millimeter wave
   frequencies (around 220GHz) and Low-Mid Earth Orbits shrinks the size of
   the space and ground infrastructure to manageable levels. In prior work
   we showed that using Brayton cycle conversion of solar power allows
   large economies of scale compared to the linear mass-power relationship
   of photovoltaic conversion. With high-temperature materials permitting
   3600 K temperature in the primary heater, over 80 percent cycle
   efficiency was shown with a closed helium cycle for the 1GW converter
   satellite which formed the core element of the architecture. Work done
   since the last IEEE conference has shown that the use of waveguides
   incorporated into lighter-than-air antenna platforms, can overcome the
   difficulties in transmitting millimeter wave power through the moist,
   dense lower atmosphere. A graphene-based radiator design conservatively
   meets the mass budget for the waste heat rejection system needed for the
   compressor inlet temperature. Placing the ultralight Mirasol collectors
   in lower orbits overcomes the solar beam spot size problem of high-orbit
   collection. The architecture begins by establishing a power exchange
   with terrestrial renewable energy plants, creating an early revenue
   generation approach with low investment. The approach allows for
   technology development and demonstration of high power millimeter wave
   technology. A multinational experiment using the International Space
   Station and another power exchange satellite is proposed to gather
   required data and experience, thus reducing the technical and policy
   risks. The full-scale architecture deploys pairs of Mirasol sunlight
   collectors and Girasol 1 GW converter satellites to ramp up space solar
   power level to over 5.6 TeraWatts by year 50 from project start.
   Runway-based launch and landing are required to achieve the launch
   productivity as well as the cost reductions to enable such a large
   deployment on schedule. Advancements in the certainty of millimeter wave
   conversion technology and runway-based space access, are seen to be the
   outstanding issues in proceeding to full-scale Space Solar Power.}},

   transistor technology and a low-cost organic package made from liquid
   crystal polymer (LCP) is presented. In-package measurements of the power
   amplifier (PA) at 8 GHz show a P.A.E.(max) of >31\%, P-1dB of 20 dBm and
   gain of 11.42 dB. A 4x1 patch antenna array was also fabricated on the
   same platform. Though no thermal management was used, an effective
   isotropically radiated power (EIRP) in excess of 20 dBm at 10 GHz was
   measured for the transmitter module, consisting of only a single-stage
   PA and antenna array, thus demonstrating that even greater performance
   can be achieved in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of finding the median of three genomes is the key process in
   building the most parsimonious phylogenetic trees from genome
   rearrangement data. The median problem using Double-Cut-and-Join (DCJ)
   distance is NP-hard and the best exact algorithm is based on a
   branch-and-bound best-first search strategy to explore sub-graph
   patterns in Multiple BreakPoint Graph (MBG). In this paper, by taking
   advantage of the ``streaming{''} property of MBG, we introduce the
   ``footprint-based{''} data structure to reduce the space requirement of
   a single search nodes from O(v(2)) to O(v); minimize the redundant
   computation in counting cycles/paths to update bounds, which leads to
   dramatically decrease of workload of a single search node. Additional
   heuristic of branching strategy is introduced to help reducing the
   searching space. Last but not least, the introduction of a multi-thread
   shared memory parallel algorithm with two load balancing strategies
   bring in additional benefit by distributing search work efficiently
   among different processors. We conduct extensive experiments on
   simulated datasets and our results show significant improvement on all
   datasets. And we test our DCJ median algorithm with GASTS, a state of
   the art software phylogenetic tree construction package. On the real
   high resolution Drosophila data set, our exact algorithm run as fast as
   the heuristic algorithm and help construct a better phylogenetic tree.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of thickness anisotropy on the degenerate elliptical
   resonance modes of micro-hemispherical shell resonators (mu HSRs)
   created using the thermal oxidation process is investigated. This
   anisotropy arises from the variation in wet thermal oxide growth
   according to the exposed crystal planes of the single-crystal-silicon
   hemispherical mold used to generate the mu HSRs. It is shown that,
   despite the presence of thickness anisotropy, the degenerate resonance
   modes of oxide mu HSRs can exhibit zero intrinsic frequency split
   depending on the particular resonance mode and symmetry of the thickness
   anisotropy imparted from the underlying silicon wafer. Measured results
   verified by simultaneous electrical excitation on the 0 degrees and 45
   degrees axes demonstrate less than 94 Hz intrinsic m=3 frequency split
   for a 1240 mu m oxide mu HSR (limited by measurement conditions), which

Abstract = {{The mechanical and electrochemical properties of magnesium are favorable

   microfabrication has been limited to submicron-thick film technologies

   microfabrication approaches for thicknesses greater than 10 mu m: 1)
   laser-cutting and 2) chemical etching of 70-mu m-thick commercial
   magnesium foil; and 3) through-mold electroplating of magnesium from
   non-aqueous solution. The fabrication technologies are compared on
   minimum feature size, morphology, uniformity, composition and electrical
   resistivity. Preliminary results confirmed that the 50-mu m-thick
   electroplated material composition compared favorably with commercial
   magnesium foil. The measured electrical resistivities of commercial and
   electrodeposited magnesium were 5.3 mu Omega.cm and 8.7 mu Omega.cm,
   respectively. Thick magnesium microstructures can be fabricated through
   several means to serve a broad range of MEMS-based applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents batch microfabrication and experimental
   characterization of solenoid inductors with electrodeposited silver
   windings and laminated core. To enable high-frequency operation, the
   metallic magnetic core consists of multiple air-insulated, electroplated
   micron-thick permalloy (Ni80Fe20) laminations, with total core
   thicknesses up to tens of microns. The core is achieved by sequential
   electrodeposition of permalloy and copper, followed by selective removal
   of the copper, thereby releasing the core laminations. Electroplated
   silver is selected as winding material for its low resistivity and to
   withstand the copper etching required during core release. Release of
   the core laminations is the final inductor fabrication step, reducing
   potential process-induced damage to the core. Two inductors sharing one
   laminated core in a transformer geometry are fabricated, and exhibit
   inductances of approximately 100 nH at 5 MHz, resulting in an inductance
   density of 29 nH/mm(2). This process demonstrates processing
   compatibility of using silver windings with highly-laminated,

Title = {{Stabilizing biocatalysts}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{6534-6565}},
Abstract = {{The area of biocatalysis itself is in rapid development, fueled by both
   an enhanced repertoire of protein engineering tools and an increasing
   list of solved problems. Biocatalysts, however, are delicate materials
   that hover close to the thermodynamic limit of stability. In many cases,
   they need to be stabilized to survive a range of challenges regarding
   temperature, pH value, salt type and concentration, co-solvents, as well
   as shear and surface forces. Biocatalysts may be delicate proteins,
   however, once stabilized, they are efficiently active enzymes. Kinetic
   stability must be achieved to a level satisfactory for large-scale
   process application. Kinetic stability evokes resistance to degradation
   and maintained or increased catalytic efficiency of the enzyme in which
   the desired reaction is accomplished at an increased rate. However,
   beyond these limitations, stable biocatalysts can be operated at higher
   temperatures or co-solvent concentrations, with ensuing reduction in
   microbial contamination, better solubility, as well as in many cases
   more favorable equilibrium, and can serve as more effective templates
   for combinatorial and data-driven protein engineering. To increase
   thermodynamic and kinetic stability, immobilization, protein
   engineering, and medium engineering of biocatalysts are available, the
   main focus of this work. In the case of protein engineering, there are
   three main approaches to enhancing the stability of protein
   biocatalysts: (i) rational design, based on knowledge of the
   3D-structure and the catalytic mechanism, (ii) combinatorial design,
   requiring a protocol to generate diversity at the genetic level, a
   large, often high throughput, screening capacity to distinguish `hits'
   from `misses', and (iii) data-driven design, fueled by the increased
   availability of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of equivalent
   functionality.}},

Abstract = {{A recent development in prosthetics is the osseointegrated fixation
   (OF), with improvements in comfort, fatigue, hip movement, and ease of
   prosthetic attachment reported. However, little information is available
   regarding muscle function. This study reports on selected gait
   parameters of the residual limb during the stance phase of level
   overground walking, focusing on muscle activity. Five males with
   transfemoral amputation (TFA) with OFs were recruited. Ground reaction
   force (GRF), lower-limb kinematics, and surface electromyography (sEMG)
   from residual-limb muscles were recorded. sEMG data were also collected
   from a group of 10 nondisabled male subjects. Interstance variability of
   gait parameters was assessed by coefficient of multiple correlations.
   Repeatability of GRF and hip kinematics was high, whereas repeatability
   of the sEMG was low for four of the five individuals with TFA.
   Interstance variability of the sEMG for gluteus medius (GMED) was
   significantly greater in the group with TFA. The main difference in sEMG
   between the groups was the phase, with GMED and adductor magnus
   displaying greater differences than their counterparts in the

Abstract = {{Direct observation of developmental and physiological changes in certain
   model organisms over time has been technically challenging. In the model
   organism Caenorhabditis elegans, these studies require frequent or
   continuous imaging at physiologically benign conditions. However,
   standard methods use anaesthetics, glue, or microbeads, which prevent
   animals from feeding during the experiment. Thus, the animals' normal
   physiological function may be affected over time. Here we present a
   platform designed for dynamic studies of C. elegans. The system is
   capable of immobilizing only the animals' bodies under benign conditions
   and without physical deformation. Simultaneously, the animals' heads
   remain free to move and feed for the duration of the experiment. This
   allows for high-resolution and high-magnification fluorescent imaging of
   immobilized and feeding animals. The system is very easy to fabricate,
   set up, and operate, and should be widely applicable to many problems in
   developmental and physiological studies.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a facile synthesis of Pd-Ir bimetallic
   nanostructures in the forms of core-shell octapods and alloyed
   nanocages. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of Pd
   nanocubes as the sacrificial templates and interplay of two different
   processes: the galvanic replacement between an Ir precursor and the Pd
   nanocubes and the co-reduction of Pd2+ and Ir3+ by ethylene glycol. The
   galvanic replacement played a dominant role in the initial stage,
   through which Pd atoms were dissolved from the side faces whereas Ir
   atoms were deposited at the corner sites to generate Pd-Ir core-shell
   octapods. As the concentration of Pd2+ in the reaction mixture was
   increased, co-reduction of Pd2+ and Ir3+ occurred in the late stage of
   synthesis. The resultant Pd and Ir atoms were deposited onto the
   octapods while the Pd atoms in the interiors continued to be etched away
   due to the galvanic replacement, finally leading to the formation of
   Pd-Ir alloyed nanocages. The octapods and nanocages were then evaluated
   as catalysts for the selective generation of hydrogen from the
   decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. The nanocages exhibited better
   selectivity for hydrogen generation than octapods (66\% versus 29\%),
   which can be attributed to the presence of an alloyed, porous structure
   on the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional fluid-coupled contact ultrasonic methods suffer from large
   variability, which is known to originate from a number of sources such
   as the coupling variation and the surface roughness at the
   transducer/specimen interface. The inherently small higher-harmonic
   signals can be significantly influenced by these changes in contact
   conditions, especially in nonlinear ultrasonic measurements. For this
   reason, the noncontact generation and detection techniques are very
   attractive. This research first focuses on the noncontact optical
   generation of tone-burst surface acoustic wave signals in a metallic
   specimen. Two methods that use laser light as an optical source are
   compared for generating surface acoustics waves in 5 MHz range. Both the
   shadow mask and diffraction grating are used to convert the circular
   laser beam into a periodic excitation pattern on the specimen. The
   generated signals are detected by a wedge transducer at a fixed location
   while the location of the excitation is varied. Then the harmonic
   contents in the generated signals and the repeatability of the methods
   are evaluated. Finally, the developed method is used to characterize the
   acoustic nonlinearity of aluminum (Al 6061) and steel (A36). The results
   on the aluminum samples show that the measurements based on the shadow
   mask excitation are repeatable in the ablative regime.}},

Abstract = {{Many nondestructive evaluation techniques employ surface-mounted
   piezoelectric transducers to produce Lamb waves to interrogate
   structures. However, the multimodal nature of the Lamb waves can make it
   difficult to obtain meaningful information from signal processing
   strategies that assume a single mode is present. This problem is
   typically addressed by a combination of narrowband excitations and
   careful transducer selection, which can result in acceptable mode purity
   at specific frequencies. Here a Lamb wave mode decomposition technique
   for two-element annular transducers is described, which is based upon
   the method developed by Yeum et al. {[}Wave Motion 48 p. 358, 2011]. The
   proposed technique performs the mode separation via constrained least
   squares optimization on time windowed direct arrivals from different
   transmitter-receiver element pairs. This method is advantageous for two
   reasons: (1) chirp excitations are utilized, allowing mode decomposition
   to be performed at multiple frequencies using a single set of signals,
   and (2) quadrature signals are included, which improves phase matching
   and thus can result in improved mode purity.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their ability to travel relatively long distances with low
   attenuation, guided waves are being considered as a tool for the
   detection of defects in plate-like structures for aerospace, civil, and
   petrochemical applications. When a guided wave encounters a defect, a
   scattered field related to the characteristics of the defect is
   generated. The far field scattering behavior can be described by a
   scattering matrix that quantifies the amplitude of the scattered signal
   as a function of incident and scattered angles. Because of the mode and
   frequency dependence of guided waves interacting with defects, the
   scattering matrix is typically defined for specific guided wave modes
   (incident and scattered) at a designated frequency. Prior work has
   utilized finite element modeling and full wavefield scanning to estimate
   scattering matrices, but these approaches may be impractical because of
   either computational requirements or experimental issues. Here, we
   propose a methodology for estimating a scattering matrix based upon
   limited experimental data recorded from a spatially distributed
   transducer array. After applying baseline subtraction to extract changes
   in received signals resulting from the introduction of a scatterer, we
   further process differenced signals to obtain a limited number of
   scattering matrix data points corresponding to the incident and
   scattered angles for each transducer pair. We perform radial basis
   function interpolation of these initial points to estimate the complete
   scattering matrix and evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method via
   experiments with a glued-on linear scatterer.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear ultrasonic method of second harmonic generation is used to
   detect multiple levels of damage on a single specimen. There is a
   breadth of research in the literature that measures the second harmonic
   and the resulting nonlinear parameter to monitor increasing amounts of
   uniform damage, but for this method to be applicable as an in situ
   technique, it must be able to scan an area of a structure with varying
   amounts of damage over a region. To investigate this, an aluminum alloy
   sample is shot-peened to two intensity levels along its length, to
   produce different sections of cold work and residual stress as a
   function of spatial location. Previous research has shown that the
   residual stress and cold work introduced in a material from shot peening
   causes an increase in the nonlinear parameter. Rayleigh waves are
   generated in the sample and the first and second harmonic amplitudes are
   measured at increasing propagation distances that encompass an undamaged
   section and two sections, each with different levels of shot peening.
   Results show that the nonlinear parameter increases as the Rayleigh
   wedge sensor is scanned over the shot peening sections.}},

Abstract = {{There is a well-recognized need within the structural health monitoring
   community to interrogate large, complex structures in a rapid, reliable,
   and cost-effective fashion. Ultrasonic guided waves hold promise because
   these waves have been shown to travel long distances and remain
   sensitive to both surface and subsurface features, even in complex
   structures. Distributed arrays of permanently attached, inexpensive
   piezoelectric transducers are perhaps the most effective means for
   performing guided wave structural health monitoring; however, guided
   wave signals recorded from these arrays are very complex and can be
   difficult to interpret. Current imaging algorithms used to interpret
   recorded guided waves address the complexity by considering only the
   direct-path propagation between each sensor and points of interest on
   the structure. Built-up structures that contain multiple features, such
   as stiffeners, ribs, cut-outs and fasteners, compound the difficulty of
   interpretation by substantially increasing the number of multi-path
   echoes and even precluding direct-path propagation between many portions
   of the structure. This work addresses the inherent challenges of working
   with complex structures by leveraging, rather than ignoring, the
   multi-path echoes present in ultrasonic guided wave signals through the
   use of experimentally estimated Green's functions. The proposed approach
   is validated using experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Cold rolled carbon steel 1018C is widely used in pressurized fuel
   pipelines. In these structures, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) can pose
   a significant problem because cracks initiate late in the lifetime and
   often unexpectedly, but grow fast once they get started. To ensure a
   safe operation it is crucial that any damage can be detected before the
   structural stability is reduced by large cracks. In the early stages of
   SCC, microstructural changes occur which in many cases increase the
   acoustic nonlinearity of the material. Therefore, an initially
   monochromatic Rayleigh wave is distorted and measurable higher harmonics
   are generated. Different levels of stress corrosion cracking is induced
   in five specimens. For each specimen, nonlinear ultrasonic measurements
   are performed before and after inducing the damage. For the
   measurements, oil coupled wedge transducers are used to generate and
   detect tone burst Rayleigh wave signals. The amplitudes of the received
   fundamental and second harmonic waves are measured at varying
   propagation distances to obtain a measure for the acoustic nonlinearity
   of the specimens. The results show a damage-dependent increase in
   nonlinearity for early stages of damage, indicating the feasibility of
   this nonlinear ultrasonic method to detect the initiation of stress
   corrosion cracking.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative studies of nondestructive evaluation methods have shown that
   nonlinear ultrasonic techniques are more sensitive than conventional
   linear methods to changes in material microstructure and the associated
   small-scale damage. Many of the material degradation processes such as
   carbonation in concrete, corrosion in metals, etc., initiate at the
   surface. In such cases, ultrasonic Rayleigh surface waves are especially
   appropriate for detection and characterization of damage since their
   energy is concentrated in the top layer of the test object. For the
   civil engineering infrastructure, only a limited number of field
   applicable nonlinear ultrasonic techniques have been introduced. In this
   paper a nonlinear ultrasonic measurement technique based on the use of
   Rayleigh waves is developed and used to characterize carbonation in
   concrete samples. This work develops a collinear mixing technique for
   concrete structures. Wedge transducer is used for the generation and an
   accelerometer for the detection of the fundamental and nonlinearity
   modulated ultrasonic signal components. The measurements are made by
   varying the input voltage and along the propagation distance. The slope
   of the normalized modulation amplitudes is taken as the nonlinearity
   parameter. Concrete samples with two different levels of damage are
   examined, and the difference of the two fundamental frequencies is used
   to quantify damage state.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data have demonstrated that damage induced by alkali-silica
   reaction (ASR) in concrete, even in its very early stage, can cause
   changes in the acoustic nonlinearity parameter beta. This provides a
   means to characterize ASR damage in concrete nondestructively. However,
   there is currently no model that explains the relationship between the
   acoustic nonlinearity parameter and ASR damage. In this work, we present
   a micromechanics-based chemo-mechanical model that relates the acoustic
   nonlinearity parameter to ASR damage. The mechanical part of the model
   is developed based on a modified version of the generalized
   self-consistent theory. The chemical part of the model accounts for two
   opposing diffusion processes. One is the diffusion of alkali ions in the
   pore solution into aggregates, and the other is the permeation of ASR
   gel from the aggregate surface into the surrounding porous cement
   matrix. Furthermore, a fracture model is used to simulate crack
   initiation and growth, so that the crack density and total expansion can
   be obtained. Finally, the acoustic nonlinearity parameter is determined
   as a function of exposure time by accounting for the gel pressure and
   the crack density. This model provides a way to quantitatively predict
   the changes in the acoustic nonlinearity parameter due to ASR damage,
   which can be used to guide experimental measurements for nondestructive
   evaluation of ASR damage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an accelerated variant of the hybrid proximal
   extragradient (HPE) method for convex optimization, referred to as the
   accelerated HPE (A-HPE) framework. Iteration-complexity results are
   established for the A-HPE framework, as well as a special version of it,
   where a large stepsize condition is imposed. Two specific
   implementations of the A-HPE framework are described in the context of a
   structured convex optimization problem whose objective function consists
   of the sum of a smooth convex function and an extended real-valued
   nonsmooth convex function. In the first implementation, a generalization
   of a variant of Nesterov's method is obtained for the case where the
   smooth component of the objective function has Lipschitz continuous
   gradient. In the second implementation, an accelerated Newton proximal
   extragradient (A-NPE) method is obtained for the case where the smooth
   component of the objective function has Lipschitz continuous Hessian. It
   is shown that the A-NPE method has a O(1/k(7/2)) convergence rate, which
   improves upon the O(1/k(3)) convergence rate bound for another
   accelerated Newton-type method presented by Nesterov. Finally, while
   Nesterov's method is based on exact solutions of subproblems with cubic
   regularization terms, the A-NPE method is based on inexact solutions of
   subproblems with quadratic regularization terms and hence is potentially
   more tractable from a computational point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Buckled monolayers of diameter-tunable microgel spheres constitute a
   soft-matter model system for studying geometric frustration in
   hard-condensed-matter antiferromagnetic materials. In the plane, the
   spheres self-assemble to form a triangular lattice. By considering the
   free volume available to two spheres slightly out of the plane, one
   finds an effective antiferromagnetic interaction; each pair of
   neighboring spheres prefers to be one up and one down. However, the
   topology of the triangular lattice prevents all pairs from
   simultaneously satisfying this rule. The micrometer length scale of the
   spheres enables direct visualization of the `spin' dynamics at the
   single-particle level. These dynamics exhibit glassiness, which
   originates from the in-plane lattice distortions that partially relieve
   frustration and produce ground states with zigzagging stripes.}},

Abstract = {{Design methodologies such as Razor {[}3,4] minimize power dissipation by
   slowing down circuits so as to eliminate timing slacks to the point
   where occasional timing errors are observed. The main challenge here is
   the design of efficient mechanisms to detect and recover from these
   infrequent errors without loss of functionality. We present a design for
   widely used Wallace multipliers where, because of the highly skewed
   input based statistical distribution in completion delays, the potential
   for power and performance gains is significantly higher. Clock periods
   can be potentially reduced by a factor of 2 or more, with very rare
   timing errors for random input distributions. For error recovery we
   present a novel approach that latches and holds logic values at key
   internal circuit nodes during every clock cycle beyond the next clock
   edge. This allows generation of the correct outputs for that clock
   period one clock cycle later in case of a timing error. Meanwhile, very
   fast error evaluation, exploiting a unique characteristic of carry
   ripple addition, allows this hold to be quickly released if an error is
   not detected, ensuring no impact on the circuit timing in error free
   operation. Our approach is shown to deliver comparable performance to
   the fastest multipliers at substantially reduced power and hardware
   costs.}},

Abstract = {{It has been established in prior research that significant power can be
   saved by dynamically trading off the performance of individual RF
   modules for power consumption across changing channel conditions. It has
   also been shown that the control law that reconfigures the RF front end
   must take into account the process corners from which the RF devices are
   selected in order to trade off performance for power in an optimal
   manner (minimum energy/bit at prescribed data throughput). Design of
   such an optimal control law is virtually intractable due to the
   complexity of simulating the RF front end across all possible channel
   and device process conditions. Hence, existing control algorithms are
   based on a coarse sampling of the channel x process space, suffer from
   modelling inaccuracies and are inherently sub-optimal from a performance
   vs. power perspective. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a RF front
   end control methodology that is optimized during real-time operation,
   does not require up-front simulation across all channel x process
   conditions and is not susceptible to simulation inaccuracies. This
   results in far more robust/optimal control as opposed to current
   practice. A simulated annealing (SA) based framework for process
   optimization is proposed along with the use of built-in sensors for
   monitoring of performance and power. Simulation results and hardware
   data are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation of RF/mixed-signal circuits is challenging due
   to the need to excite all possible operational modes of the DUT in order
   to establish equivalence between its specified and observed behaviors
   and to ensure that the DUT does not produce any unexpected behaviors
   that can lead to system failure. In this research, we first develop a
   methodology for determining if the DUT contains behaviors that are not
   explicitly included in its behavioral model. A complex (optimized) test
   waveform is applied to the DUT and its test response signature is
   captured. It is seen that in the presence of unexpected DUT behaviors,
   the residual error in the test response signature from that defined by
   the model, cannot be minimized below a certain threshold by manipulating
   the model parameters in any way. If however, it is determined that the
   model is adequate but the signature is different from the expected, then
   a procedure is developed for determining which sub module is responsible
   for the difference (i.e. causes the system level specifications to be
   different from that specified by the behavioral model). Experiments on
   an RF transceiver are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed validation and diagnosis approach.}},

Abstract = {{Traces derived from the real-world mobile network traffic show
   significant inter-client redundancy among packets. This has inspired new
   solutions to reduce the amount of redundancy present in the data in
   order to manage the explosive traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel
   approach to leverage this redundancy by employing a novel network
   compression technique using wireless helper nodes. A Helper node
   provides the side information, that it obtained via overhearing, to
   mobile clients and assists the wireless gateway to more effectively
   compress each new packet when serving every new client. We investigate
   the potential benefits of wireless network compression from an
   information-theoretic point of view. We also describe a coding mechanism
   which adapts the two-part coding scheme to wireless network compression.
   We optimize this coding scheme to achieve minimum cost communication in
   the network. We also characterize the trade-off between the number of
   bits sent by the wireless gateway and the number of bits sent by the
   helper to a client.}},

Abstract = {{Server consolidation and application consolidation through
   virtualization are key performance optimizations in cloud-based service
   delivery industry. In this paper, we argue that it is important for both
   cloud consumers and cloud providers to understand the various factors
   that may have significant impact on the performance of applications
   running in a virtualized cloud. This paper presents an extensive
   performance study of network I/O workloads in a virtualized cloud
   environment. We first show that current implementation of virtual
   machine monitor (VMM) does not provide sufficient performance isolation
   to guarantee the effectiveness of resource sharing across multiple
   virtual machine instances (VMs) running on a single physical host
   machine, especially when applications running on neighboring VMs are
   competing for computing and communication resources. Then we study a set
   of representative workloads in cloud-based data centers, which compete
   for either CPU or network I/O resources, and present the detailed
   analysis on different factors that can impact the throughput performance
   and resource sharing effectiveness. For example, we analyze the cost and
   the benefit of running idle VM instances on a physical host where some
   applications are hosted concurrently. We also present an in-depth
   discussion on the performance impact of colocating applications that
   compete for either CPU or network I/O resources. Finally, we analyze the
   impact of different CPU resource scheduling strategies and different
   workload rates on the performance of applications running on different
   VMs hosted by the same physical machine.}},

Title = {{Hemodynamic Features in Stenosed Coronary Arteries: CFD Analysis Based
   on Histological Images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Histological images from the longitudinal section of four diseased
   coronary arteries were used, for the first time, to study the pulsatile
   blood flow distribution within the lumen of the arteries by means of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Results indicate a strong dependence
   of the hemodynamics on the morphology of atherosclerotic lesion.
   Distinctive flow patterns appear in different stenosed regions
   corresponding to the specific geometry of any artery. Results show that
   the stenosis affects the wall shear stress (WSS) locally along the
   diseased arterial wall as well as other adjacent walls. The maximum
   magnitude of WSS is observed in the throat of stenosis. Moreover, high
   oscillatory shear index (OSI) is observed along the stenosed wall and
   the high curvature regions. The present study is capable of providing
   information on the shear environment in the longitudinal section of the
   diseased coronary arteries, based on the models created from
   histological images. The computational method may be used as an
   effective way to predict plaque forming regions in healthy arterial
   walls.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{4368-4374}},
Abstract = {{The conduction development mechanism of silicone-based electrically
   conductive adhesives (Silo-ECAs) is studied. The reduction of
   surfactants on silver flakes by hydride in the silicone backbone and the
   subsequent sintering of the generated silver nanoparticles between
   micron-sized silver flakes are found to be the major contributor to the
   conductivity development in Silo-ECAs; this is in contrast with the
   mechanism observed in most polymer-metal ECAs, where the curing
   shrinkage of the polymer matrix is the major cause of conductivity
   development. The conductivity development in Silo-ECAs ceases when the
   polymer curing is completed. Hence, in order to enhance the resulting
   electrical conductivity, the curing process is prolonged by using a
   long-chain prepolymer, lowering the platinum catalyst concentration, or
   adding curing inhibitors. A bulk resistivity of 8.82 x 10(-5) Omega cm
   is achieved, which is 55\% lower than the best values reported
   previously for Silo-ECAs.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{2834-2839}},
Abstract = {{Contemporary lab-chip devices require efficient, high-performance mixing
   capability. A series of artificial cilia with embedded magnetic
   particles was fabricated to achieve precise flow manipulation through
   magnetically driven control. These fabricated structures were actuated
   in a homogeneous magnetic field generated by a built-in magnetic coil
   system for various beating cycles inside a microchannel. Three
   representative trajectories, namely, circular motion, back-and-forth
   oscillation, and a figure-of-eight pattern, of artificial cilia were
   designed and generated to mimic the motion of actual cilia. Homogeneous
   mixing of two highly viscous (>25 centipoise) dyed solutions by using
   the figure-of-eight trajectory achieved a mixing efficiency of
   approximately 86\%. The underlying relationship between ciliated
   structures and the induced flow fields was further elucidated by
   performing a hydrodynamic analysis with micro-particle image
   velocimetry. In addition, a numerical modeling method which used a fluid
   structure interaction module was applied to provide quantitative 3D
   illustrations of induced flow patterns, including vortical structures
   and vortex core locations. The results reveal that both the magnitude
   and distribution of induced vortices primarily affect the mixing
   performance of two viscous flow streams. By using magnetically
   controlled artificial cilia along with the presented analytical
   paradigms, a new active flow mixing strategy was suggested to
   efficiently transport/agitate flows for microfluidics and biomedical
   applications.}},

Title = {{Artificial Neural Networks in Mammography Interpretation and Diagnostic
   Decision Making}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Screening mammography is the most effective means for early detection of
   breast cancer. Although general rules for discriminating malignant and
   benign lesions exist, radiologists are unable to perfectly detect and
   classify all lesions as malignant and benign, for many reasons which
   include, but are not limited to, overlap of features that distinguish
   malignancy, difficulty in estimating disease risk, and variability in
   recommended management. When predictive variables are numerous and
   interact, ad hoc decision making strategies based on experience and
   memory may lead to systematic errors and variability in practice. The
   integration of computer models to help radiologists increase the
   accuracy of mammography examinations in diagnostic decision making has
   gained increasing attention in the last two decades. In this study, we
   provide an overview of one of the most commonly used models, artificial
   neural networks (ANNs), in mammography interpretation and diagnostic
   decision making and discuss important features in mammography
   interpretation. We conclude by discussing several common limitations of
   existing research on ANN-based detection and diagnostic models and
   provide possible future research directions.}},

Title = {{Printed electrically conductive composites: conductive filler designs
   and surface engineering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{4052-4069}},
Abstract = {{Enormous efforts have been made towards the next generation of flexible,
   low-cost, environmentally benign printed electronics. In this regard,
   advanced materials for the printed conductive lines and interconnects
   are of significant importance. To improve efficiency and effectiveness,
   for several decades, conductive fillers have been filled into
   dispersants, which lead to the so-called electrically conductive
   composites (ECCs), which are a key material to the printed electronics
   varying from substituting the traditional solders to finding new
   applications in the blooming field of flexible printed electronics. ECCs
   in various formulations have converged in the current efforts to develop
   platforms with the desired specifications of electrical and thermal
   conductance, mechanical strength, and others. This platform is highly
   versatile and valuable for the emerging novel electronic devices, which
   emphasize tailoring processing conditions to cater to the key functional
   materials to optimize outcomes. The properties obtained can facilitate
   decisions about modifications to treatment. Noble metal fillers, such as
   silver flakes, have long been studied as active fillers for the ECCs.
   Owing to the recent progress in nanotechnology and surface
   modifications, many new avenues have opened for them. By taking
   advantage of the well-developed surface chemistry of these materials,
   researchers are enhancing their electrical conductivity, which is
   essential for broader applications. In recent years, the advances of
   ECCs have benefited the development of the applications of
   optoelectronics, e-papers, electromagnetic shielding, clinical
   diagnosis, radio frequency devices, etc. Despite the various advantages
   that they can offer over the traditional technologies, their
   limitations, e. g. low electrical conductivity, poor impact strength,
   increased contact resistance at elevated temperatures and humidity
   aging, have been considered as the major obstacles. In this feature
   article, we introduce the surface engineering techniques of the
   conductive filler materials that we and others have developed, with an
   emphasis on how these techniques influence the performance of the ECCs,
   especially for the improvement of the filler-to-filler electron transfer
   in the resin dispersants, some of which have potentially been
   approaching the theoretical upper limit of what they can reach in
   electrical conductivity. We and others have developed a set of chemical
   and engineering methods to modify the conductive fillers, enabling
   tailor-made surface functionalities and charges. These features, in
   turn, can be harnessed to adjust the electrical property and reliability
   of the ECCs, and further, to cater to various novel printed electronics,
   based on e. g. low temperature processing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a symptom complex noticed commonly
   among high altitude travelers. The occurrence of AMS depends on multiple
   factors that have been studied extensively. However, AMS in individuals
   with neurological impairments has not been considered in detail. A total
   of 168 subjects, including active controls, inactive controls, and those
   with spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain
   injury (TBI), were studied at the National Veterans Winter Sports Clinic
   in Snowmass, Colorado, from 2007 to 2009 for the occurrence of AMS. Lake
   Louise Score was used to quantify symptoms. A higher than anticipated
   occurrence of AMS (42.85\%) among the study population was noted, with
   significantly higher Lake Louis Scores among athletes with neurological
   impairments. Disability group, prior history of AIMS, and prior
   occurrence of headache at high altitude could be used as predictors for
   the development of AMS symptoms. More research is warranted specifically
   targeting the interaction between factors affecting AMS and the
   pathophysiology of neurological impairments like SCI and TBI to further
   our understanding about prophylactic medications and treatments for AMS,
   especially because many military personnel with neurological impairments
   continue on Active Duty.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{8878-8889}},
Abstract = {{Interaction of p3 (A beta(17-42)) peptides with cell membranes is
   crucial for the understanding of amyloid toxicity associated with
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). Such p3-membrane interactions are considered
   to induce the disruption of membrane permeability and integrity, but the
   exact mechanisms of how p3 aggregates, particularly small p3 oligomers,
   induce receptor-independent membrane disruption are not yet completely
   understood. Here, we investigate the adsorption, orientation, and
   surface interaction of the p3 pentamer with lipid bilayers composed of
   both pure zwitterionic POPC (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) and
   mixed anionic POPC-POPG (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol) (3 : 1)
   lipids using explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD
   simulation results show that the p3 pentamer has much stronger
   interactions with mixed POPC-POPG lipids than pure POPC lipids,
   consistent with experimental observation that Ab adsorption and
   fibrillation are enhanced on anionic lipid bilayers. Although
   electrostatic interactions are main attractive forces to drive the p3
   pentamer to adsorb on the bilayer surface, the adsorption of the p3
   pentamer on the lipid bilayer with C-terminal beta-strands facing toward
   the bilayer surface is a net outcome of different competitions between
   p3 peptides-lipid bilayer and ions-p3-bilayer interactions. More
   importantly, Ca2+ ions are found to form ionic bridges to associate
   negatively charged residues of p3 with anionic headgroups of the lipid
   bilayer, resulting in A beta-Ca2+-PO4- complexes. Intensive Ca2+ bound
   to the lipid bilayer and Ca2+ ionic bridges may lead to Ca2+ hemostasis
   responsible for neuronal dysfunction and death. This work provides
   insights into the mutual structure, dynamics, and interactions of both A
   beta peptides and lipid bilayers at the atomic level, which expand our
   understanding of the complex behavior of amyloid-induced membrane
   disruption.}},

Journal = {{ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{P275-P281}},
Abstract = {{Low temperature plasma-based subtractive etching of Ag and Au films was
   demonstrated and results compared to those of similar studies for Cu
   etching. Ag and Au were etched in H-2 plasmas at 10 degrees C at rates
   of 33 nm/min and 26 nm/min, respectively. These rates were higher than
   those reported for Cu etching in H-2 plasmas. Such results suggest that
   metal reaction with hydrogen to form hydrides plays an important role in
   the plasma etch process for these Group 11 metals. Unlike Cu, etch rates
   of Ag and Au increased with an increase in etchant species (He and Ar)
   atomic mass. Comparison of Ag etch rates using H-2, He, and Ar plasmas
   with those of Cu indicates that momentum transfer during the etch
   process plays a more significant role in Ag etching than in Cu etching.
   In addition, the higher etch rate of Au relative to Cu in an H-2 plasma,
   indicates the importance of chemical reaction between H-2 and Au in the
   Au etching mechanism. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

   decreasing the molecular weight of the ionomer improves fuel cell
   performance. Finally, higher fuel cell performance was observed with
   quinuclidinium head groups on the anionic ionomer, in comparison to the
   more traditional trimethyl ammonium cation. The improvements in
   performance appear to be due to improved mass transport of reactants and

Abstract = {{Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2-NPs) are increasingly used in
   polishing, engine enhancement agents and many other products. Even
   though the acute toxicity of CeO2-NPs to plants has been investigated,
   the long-term effects of CeO2-NPs in the environment are still unknown.
   The main objective of this study was to investigate whether the
   treatment of tomato plants with relatively low concentrations of
   CeO2-NPs (10 mg L-1) through their lifecycle would affect the seed
   quality and the development of second generation seedlings. The results
   indicated that second generation seedlings grown from seeds collected
   from treated parent plants with CeO2-NPs (treated second generation
   seedlings) were generally smaller and weaker, as indicated by their
   smaller biomass, lower water transpiration and slightly higher reactive
   oxygen species content. An interesting phenomenon noticed in the study
   was that the second generation seedlings grown from treated seeds
   developed extensive root hairs compared with the control second
   generation seedlings (seedlings grown from seeds collected from
   untreated parent plants) regardless of the treatment. Treated second
   generation seedlings also accumulate a higher amount of ceria than
   control second generation seedlings under the same treatment conditions
   even though such differences are not statistically significant.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we study the sensitivity of cloud droplet number
   concentration to aerosol characteristics in the framework of a Global
   Circulation Model (GCM) by using the newly developed adjoints of a
   number of physically based droplet activation parameterizations. The
   adjoint sensitivities of these activation parameterizations were
   implemented in the Community Atmospheric Model version 5, which includes
   interactive aerosols and detailed cloud microphysics. These simulations
   exhibit clear patterns of high-sensitivity areas to aerosol number
   concentration coinciding with relatively clean environments, as well as
   continental and relatively polluted areas showing saturation with
   respect to aerosol load changes. Furthermore, in order to identify
   process-level discrepancies between the activation schemes in the
   absence of feedbacks, aerosol input fields from the Global Modeling
   Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model were used to drive off-line
   comparisons between the sensitivities of the droplet number predicted by
   these parameterizations against predictions with detailed numerical
   simulations of the activation process. Important differences were
   observed particularly in their response to number concentration and
   hygroscopicity of fine and coarse mode aerosols. Overall, the
   parameterizations were capable of capturing the response of droplet
   concentrations to perturbations in aerosol number concentration, and
   updraft velocity better than to chemical composition variations.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol particles in the marine boundary layer include primary organic
   and salt particles from sea spray and combustion-derived particles from
   ships and coastal cities. These particle types serve as nuclei for
   marine cloud droplet activation, although the particles that activate
   depend on the particle size and composition as well as the
   supersaturation that results from cloud updraft velocities. The Eastern
   Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (E-PEACE) 2011 was a targeted
   aircraft campaign to assess how different particle types nucleate cloud
   droplets. As part of E-PEACE 2011, we studied the role of marine
   particles as cloud droplet nuclei and used emitted particle sources to
   separate particle-induced feedbacks from dynamical variability. The
   emitted particle sources included shipboard smoke-generated particles
   with 0.05-1 mu m diameters (which produced tracks measured by satellite
   and had drop composition characteristic of organic smoke) and combustion
   particles from container ships with 0.05-0.2 mu m diameters (which were
   measured in a variety of conditions with droplets containing both
   organic and sulfate components) {[}1]. Three central aspects of the
   collaborative E-PEACE results are: (1) the size and chemical composition
   of the emitted smoke particles compared to ship-track-forming cargo ship
   emissions as well as background marine particles, with particular
   attention to the role of organic particles, (2) the characteristics of
   cloud track formation for smoke and cargo ships, as well as the role of
   multi-layered low clouds, and (3) the implications of these findings for
   quantifying aerosol indirect effects. For comparison with the E-PEACE
   results, the preliminary results of the Stratocumulus Observations of
   Los-Angeles Emissions Derived Aerosol-Droplets (SOLEDAD) 2012 provided
   evidence of the cloud-nucleating roles of both marine organic particles
   and coastal urban pollution, with simultaneous measurements of the
   effective supersaturations of the clouds in the California coastal
   region.}},

   ambient aerosols, the rate of which is strongly affected by the
   condensation (or mass accommodation) coefficient, alpha(c). Estimates of
   alpha(c) for droplet growth from activation of ambient particles vary
   considerably and represent a critical source of uncertainty in estimates
   of global cloud droplet distributions and the aerosol indirect forcing
   of climate. An analysis of ten globally relevant data sets of cloud
   condensation nuclei is used to constrain alpha(c), and find that rapid
   activation kinetics (alpha(c) > 0.1) is uniformly prevalent. This means
   that uncertainty in water vapor accommodation on droplets is less than
   previously thought and resolves a long-standing issue in cloud physics.}},

Abstract = {{Light-alloy castings often exhibit variability in the fracture sensitive
   properties such as ductility that does not necessarily correlate to the
   global average microstructural parameters such as dendrite cell size and
   porosity volume fraction in the three-dimensional microstructure.
   Nonetheless, in numerous such cases, the variability in the fracture
   sensitive properties does correlate to the variability in the local
   distributions of microstructural features and processing defects because
   the fracture path preferentially goes through the regions containing
   large concentrations of the defects and/or microstructural extrema. This
   paper presents the results of a detailed quantitative metallography and
   quantitative fractography based investigation of the relationships
   between microstructure and variability in uniaxial tensile ductility of
   the tensile test specimens drawn from very large size Al alloy
   automotive component castings fabricated using tilt-pour permanent-mold
   casting process. The percent tensile ductility e shows strong
   quantitative correlation with the area fraction of the porosity f in the
   corresponding fracture surfaces, which can be represented by the
   following power-law relationship, where e(0) and n are empirical

Abstract = {{Providing tools to achieve a high level of safety transportation is the
   important objective in VANETs research. Hence, most of the works are
   devoted to developing safety-message dissemination algorithms. However,
   non-safety applications can also contribute to the network efficiency by
   exchanging traffic information. To support these applications, VANETs
   adopt the wireless access in the vehicular environment (WAVE) to
   guarantee the quality of service (QoS) using four different access
   categories. However, the WAVE could not provide the QoS to the users due
   to the collisions caused by the small contention-window size for the top
   priority traffic when top-priority traffic is dominant. Therefore, this
   small contention-window size setting for the prioritization induces
   severe performance degradation. In this paper, the Dynamic
   Service-Channels Allocation (DSCA) method is proposed to maximize
   throughput by dynamically assigning different service channels to the
   users. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulation works suggest that
   the DSCA improves the average throughput by 22\% over the uniform
   channel allocation method. Moreover, the DSCA can be easily implemented
   in real devices without any protocol modifications.}},

Abstract = {{We present an LED light source for use with standard clinical endoscopes
   to enable visualization of tissues labeled with quantum dots (QDs).
   QD-assisted endoscopy may improve the outcome of surgical endoscopic
   procedures by identifying specific tissue types. QDs offer several
   advantages over current fluorescent stains due to their high target
   selectivity, long-lasting fluorescence, large excitation and narrow
   emission bands, and multiplexing capabilities. The prototype presented
   is compact, modular in design, and was built at low cost making it
   competitive with commercially available light sources. The device's
   efficiency is evaluated by measuring light intensity at discreet
   locations and by successfully illuminating a chicken tissue sample
   non-specifically labeled with a 250nM or 500nM QD solution. Ultimately,
   this device serves as a step towards incorporating QDs into real time,
   image-guided surgical procedures.}},

Title = {{Droplet number uncertainties associated with CCN: an assessment using
   observations and a global model adjoint}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4235-4251}},
Abstract = {{We use the Global Modelling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model
   with a cloud droplet parameterisation adjoint to quantify the
   sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration to uncertainties in
   predicting CCN concentrations. Published CCN closure uncertainties for
   six different sets of simplifying compositional and mixing state
   assumptions are used as proxies for modelled CCN uncertainty arising
   from application of those scenarios. It is found that cloud droplet
   number concentrations (N-d) are fairly insensitive to the number
   concentration (N-a) of aerosol which act as CCN over the continents
   (partial derivative lnN(d)/partial derivative lnN(a) similar to 10-30
   \%), but the sensitivities exceed 70\% in pristine regions such as the
   Alaskan Arctic and remote oceans. This means that CCN concentration
   uncertainties of 4-71\% translate into only 1-23\% uncertainty in cloud
   droplet number, on average. Since most of the anthropogenic indirect
   forcing is concentrated over the continents, this work shows that the
   application of Kohler theory and attendant simplifying assumptions in
   models is not a major source of uncertainty in predicting cloud droplet
   number or anthropogenic aerosol indirect forcing for the liquid,
   stratiform clouds simulated in these models. However, it does highlight
   the sensitivity of some remote areas to pollution brought into the
   region via long-range transport (e. g., biomass burning) or from
   seasonal biogenic sources (e. g., phytoplankton as a source of
   dimethylsulfide in the southern oceans). Since these transient processes
   are not captured well by the climatological emissions inventories
   employed by current large-scale models, the uncertainties in
   aerosol-cloud interactions during these events could be much larger than
   those uncovered here. This finding motivates additional measurements in
   these pristine regions, for which few observations exist, to quantify
   the impact (and associated uncertainty) of transient aerosol processes
   on cloud properties.}},

Title = {{Aerosol mixing state, hygroscopic growth and cloud activation efficiency
   during MIRAGE 2006}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{5049-5062}},
Abstract = {{Observations of aerosol hygroscopic growth and CCN activation spectra
   for submicron particles are reported for the T1 ground site outside of
   Mexico City during the MIRAGE 2006 campaign. kappa-Kohler theory is used
   to evaluate the characteristic hygroscopicity parameter, kappa{*}, for
   the CCN active aerosol population using both size-resolved HTMDA and
   size-resolved CCNc measurements. Organic mass fractions (f(org)) are
   evaluated from size-resolved aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS)
   measurements, from which predictions of the hygroscopicity parameter are
   compared against kappa{*}. Strong diurnal changes in aerosol water
   uptake parameters and aerosol composition are observed. We find that new
   particle formation (NPF) events are correlated with an increased
   kappa{*} and CCN-active fraction during the daytime, with greater impact
   on smaller particles. During NPF events, the number concentration of 40
   nm particles acting as CCN at 0.51\%+/- 0.06\% supersaturation can
   surpass by more than a factor of two the corresponding concentrations of
   100 nm particles. We also find that at 06:00-08:00 LT throughout the
   campaign, fresh traffic emissions result in substantial changes to the
   chemical distribution of the aerosol, with on average 65\% externally
   mixed fraction for 40 nm particles and 30\% externally mixed fraction
   for 100 nm particles, whereas at midday nearly all particles of both
   sizes can be described as ``internally mixed{''}. Average activation
   spectra and growth factor distributions are analyzed for different time
   periods characterizing the daytime (with and without NPF events), the
   early morning ``rush hour{''} and the entire campaign. We show that
   kappa{*} derived from CCNc measurements decreases as a function of size
   during all time periods, while the CCN-active fraction increases as a
   function of size. Size-resolved AMS measurements do not predict the
   observed trend for kappa{*} versus particle size, which can be
   attributed to unresolved mixing state and the presence of refractory
   material not measured by the AMS. Measured kappa{*} typically ranges
   from 0.2 to 0.35, and organics typically make up 60-85\% of the aerosol
   mass in the size range studied. We show that kappa(AMS) is able to
   describe CCN concentrations reasonably well, provided mixing-state
   information is available, especially at the highest CCN concentrations.
   This is consistent with other CCN studies carried out in urban
   environments, and is partly due to the fact that the highest CCN
   concentrations occur during the daytime when the aerosol is internally
   mixed. During the early morning rush hour, however, failing to account
   for the aerosol mixing state results in systematic overestimation of CCN
   concentrations by as much as 50-100\% on average.}},

Title = {{A Model of Job Activity Description for Workplace Accommodation
   Assessment}},
Journal = {{ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-124}},
Abstract = {{Workplace accommodations to enable employees with disabilities to
   perform essential job tasks are an important strategy ways for
   increasing the presence of people with disabilities in the labor market.
   However, assessments, which are crucial to identifying necessary
   accommodations, are typically conducted using a variety of methods that
   lack consistent procedures and comprehensiveness of information. This
   can lead to the rediscovery of the same solutions over and over,
   inability to replicate assessments and a failure to effectively meet all
   of an individual's accommodation needs.
   To address standardize assessment tools and processes, a taxonomy of
   demand-producing activity factors is needed to complement the taxonomies
   of demand-producing person and environment factors already available in
   the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
   (ICF). The purpose of this article is to propose a hierarchical model of
   accommodation assessment based on level of specificity of job activity.
   While the proposed model is neither a taxonomy nor an assessment
   process, the seven-level hierarchical model provides a conceptual
   framework of job activity that is the first step toward such a taxonomy
   as well as providing a common language that can bridge the many
   approaches to assessment. The model was designed and refined through
   testing against various job examples. Different levels of activity are
   defined to be easily linked to different accommodation strategies.
   Finally, the levels can be cross-walked to the ICF, which enhances its
   acceptability, utility and universality.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Elemental potassium has been extensively used as an indicator of biomass
   burning in the source apportionment of PM2.5. We present a method to
   estimate the fraction of potassium associated with biomass burning (K-b)
   based on a linear regression with iron that can be applied at any site
   where PM2.5 chemical speciation is available. The estimated fraction has
   a significantly greater correlation with levoglucosan (R-2=0.63), an
   organic tracer of biomass burning, than total potassium (R-2=0.39). We
   explore temporal and spatial variability of K-b over a period of six
   years in the Atlanta area. K-b is larger in spring when biomass burning
   activity is more prevalent and during weekends due to the use of
   fireplaces in winter and outdoor charcoal cooking in summer. K-b is the
   predominate form of potassium for the rural site in this study. The use
   of K-b in a receptor model results in a lower fraction of PM2.5
   apportioned to biomass burning and a greater fraction to mobile sources
   when compared to the use of total K. Results suggest that K-b is a good
   indicator of biomass burning.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to determine a semiconductor's band edge positions is
   important for the design of new photocatalyst materials. In this paper,
   we introduced an experimental method based on Kelvin probe force
   microscopy to determine the conduction and valence band edge energies of
   semiconductor nanomaterials, which has rarely been demonstrated. We
   tested the method on six semiconductor nanoparticles (alpha-Fe2O3, CeO2,
   Al2O3, CuO, TiO2, and ZnO) with known electronic structures. The
   experimentally determined band edge positions for a-Fe2O3, Al2O3, and
   CuO well matched the literature values with no statistical difference.
   Except CeO2, all other metal oxides had a consistent upward bias in the
   experimental measurements of band edge positions because of the
   shielding effect of the adsorbed surface water layer. This experimental
   approach may outstand as a unique alternative way of probing the band
   edge energy positions of semiconductor materials to complement the
   current computational methods, which often find limitations in new
   synthetic or complex materials. Ultimately, this work provides
   scientific foundation for developing experimental tools to probe
   nanoscale electronic properties of photocatalytic materials, which will
   drive breakthroughs in the design of novel photocatalytic systems and
   advance the fundamental understanding of material properties.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of population and socio-economic activities has escalated
   the water demand for various purposes and put stress on existing water
   resources across the world, in particular in arid and semi-arid
   countries. Hence, managing the optimum use of water resources is a
   crucial issue and it is imperative to adopt realistic policies to ensure
   water is used more efficiently in various sectors. This paper presents
   an optimization analysis to determine monthly operating rules for the
   Doroudzan Reservoir located in southern Iran. Different strategies under
   limited water availability conditions have been analyzed by running an
   optimization model based on observed and synthetic inflow data, and the
   performance indicators of each strategy are presented. Each strategy
   includes a minimum requirement release in the optimization process and
   results in a specific operation policy. In this study, LINGO is applied
   to determine optimum operational parameters and the synthetic inflows
   are generated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The results
   demonstrated that the applied methods could efficiently optimize the
   current operation policy of an existing reservoir in a single-objective
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{Multiplicative noise naturally appears in coherent imaging systems, such
   as synthetic aperture radar. Due to the edge preserving feature of total
   variation (TV), variational models with TV regularization show good
   performance for multiplicative denoising. Recently proposed augmented
   Lagrangian frameworks with the Gauss-Seidel method are efficient for
   solving multiplicative denoising variational models with TV. But recent
   algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian require inner iterations or
   an inverse involving the Laplacian operator at each iteration. In this
   paper, we propose efficient algorithms for TV regularized convex
   variational models. Our proposed algorithms do not require any inner
   iteration or the inverse involving the Laplacian operator by using a
   linearization scheme and a proximal function. We establish global
   convergence under a Lipschitz continuous assumption on the gradient of
   the fidelity term when a correction step is used. Numerical results show
   that our proposed algorithms overall outperform the augmented Lagrangian
   based state-of-the-art algorithms for multiplicative denoising problems.}},

Abstract = {{Aortic valve disease and atherosclerosis tend to coexist in most
   patients with cardiovascular disease; however, the causes and mechanisms
   of disease development in heart valves are still not clearly understood.
   To understand the contributions of the magnitude of cyclic strain (5\%
   hypotension, 10\% physiological, and 15\% hypertension) in
   calcification, we used a model system of tissue-engineered collagen gels
   containing human aortic smooth muscle cells and human aortic valvular
   interstitial cells, both isolated from noncalcific heart transplant
   tissue. The compacted collagen gels were cultured in osteogenic media
   for 3 weeks in a custom-designed bioreactor and all assessments were
   performed at the end of the culture period. The major finding of this
   study is that bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 and BMP-4 and
   transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA expression significantly changed
   in response to the magnitude of applied strain in valvular cells, while
   the lowest expression was observed for the representative physiological
   strain. On the other hand, mRNA expression in vascular cells did not
   vary in response to the magnitude of strain. Regarding BMP-2 and BMP-4
   protein expression determined by immunostaining, trends were similar to
   mRNA expression in vascular and valvular cells, where only valvular
   cells showed a varied protein expression depending on the magnitude of
   the strain applied. Our results suggest that cellular differences exist
   between vascular and valvular cells in their response to altered levels
   of cyclic strain during calcification. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cells are attractive candidates as a cell source for
   regenerative medicine and tissue engineering therapies. Current methods
   of differentiation result in low yields and impure populations of target
   phenotypes, with attempts for improved efficiency often comparing
   protocols that vary multiple parameters. This basic science study
   focused on a single variable to understand the effects of
   two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) culture on directed
   differentiation. We compared mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
   differentiated on collagen type I-coated surfaces (SLIDEs), embedded in
   collagen type I gels (GELs), and in suspension as embryoid bodies (EBs).
   For a systematic analysis in these studies, key parameters were kept
   identical to allow for direct comparison across culture configurations.
   We determined that all three configurations supported differentiation of
   ESCs and that the kinetics of differentiation differed greatly for cells
   cultured in 2D versus 3D. SLIDE cultures induced overall differentiation
   more quickly than 3D configurations, with earlier expression of
   cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins. For 3D culture as GELs
   or EBs, cells clustered similarly, formed complex structures and
   promoted differentiation towards cardiovascular phenotypes. GEL culture,
   however, also allowed for contraction of the collagen matrix. For
   differentiation towards fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells which
   actively remodel their environment, GEL culture may be particularly
   beneficial. Overall, this study determined the effects of dimensionality
   on differentiation and helps in the rational design of protocols to
   generate phenotypes needed for tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

   excellent robustness and could stably scavenge energy from the motion of

Abstract = {{The rate of many chemical and energy transformation processes depends on
   the kinetics of charge and mass transfer in porous electrodes, but
   rational design of efficient nanostructured electrodes is hindered by an
   inability to quantify effects of micro/nano-structures of real devices.
   Here we report a framework for detailed simulations conformal to 3D
   micro/nano-scale reconstructions of porous structures, obtained from
   phase-sensitive x-ray nanotomography, using COMSOL and iso2mesh packages
   coordinated with custom code for automated feature recognition, meshing,
   refinement, equation assignment, and solution. This computational
   framework is illustrated in visualizing 3D surface activity of an
   operating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrode under low and high bias
   along two important transport pathways (bulk and surface), showing the
   effect of local nanostructured morphology on global electrochemical
   response and demonstrating cathodic activation of bulk La1-xSrxMnO3
   +/-delta (LSM). The methodology is flexible with possibilities for
   superimposition of mechanical, thermal, and other processes and for
   incorporation of inputs from multi-scale calculations. It has potential
   to serve as a platform for rational design of complex nanostructured
   hetero-foam devices with desired functionalities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The operations and support (O\&S) activities of aerospace vehicles
   involve the maintenance process to repair and replace broken parts and
   the logistics system which replenishes spares in the inventory. O\&S
   cost represents the majority of the vehicle life cycle cost, and there
   are various research efforts focused on reducing it. Improvements to
   maintenance and logistics systems are expensive to perform in real life,
   so creating a modeling and simulation (M\&S) environment capable of
   analyzing these systems allows for the testing of efficient changes.
   These systems operate on well-defined procedures and rules, and they can
   be modeled using discrete event simulation (DES).
   A DES environment, Virtual Environment for Operations and support
   Process Simulation (VE-OPS), is being developed for maintenance and
   logistics analysis using an object-oriented programming language.
   Generic class variables are defined for simulation objects such as
   vehicles and for maintenance and logistics process steps such as vehicle
   assessment and repairs. In the simulation, the vehicle and part objects
   are passed from one process to the next. This environment structure
   provides flexibility to tailor the model to specific applications while
   reducing the burden of recreating it for different projects, and by
   using an open source language such as Python, it can be shared with
   other researchers and freely deployed on multiple machines. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The current trend in system of systems design is to explore larger and
   more diverse alternative spaces earlier in the design process. However,
   the ability to do so is constrained by the efficiency of the models used
   during the process. Previous research has suggested that aggregation
   function based models for calculating the overall performance of a
   system of systems concept can be a very effective way to explore such
   alternative spaces efficiently. However, such modeling frameworks
   require the creation of the aggregation functions and as of yet no
   method or framework has been proposed for choosing the functions that
   properly model anything but the simplest system of systems. This
   research surveys existing aggregation methods from the perspective of
   system of systems modeling, and attempts to find families of aggregation
   functions that are well suited for modeling relevant types of
   alternatives and metrics. The goal is ultimately to populate an
   aggregation based modeling framework with the correct aggregation
   functions given all the desired alternative types and metrics of
   performance. This paper takes the first steps in developing the
   framework by identifying candidate functions and methods which may be
   appropriate for an aggregation-based approach. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The corrective maintenance process can be decomposed into failure and
   repair processes. Creating a model to capture the corrective maintenance
   process then requires an accurate estimate of the behavior of these
   constituent processes. For systems composed of many individual parts,
   information about failure and repair behavior is more likely to be
   available at the component level than the system level. Depending on the
   number of components that comprise the system, modeling each part may
   become computationally burdensome; in addition, some few components may
   account for a large portion of the overall system failures.
   In such a situation, one solution to the modeling burden is aggregation:
   the mathematical assimilation of many component distributions into a
   single representative distribution for the group. This paper describes
   how aggregation may be performed for such a system and how an algorithm
   may be developed to automate the process. Next, it describes how to
   simulate an aggregated distribution using a pseudo-random number
   generator and finally demonstrates these concepts for a sample problem.
   The first section of the paper introduces corrective maintenance
   modeling and aggregation; the second section describes aggregation for
   corrective maintenance; the third explains how to simulate the
   aggregated distribution; the fourth demonstrates aggregation; and the
   fifth discusses limitations of the method and concludes. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The aerospace supply chain network has evolved and become more complex
   over the years. New methods are needed to design and analyze the system,
   and to establish the interactions between aircraft (product) design and
   supply chain (process) design. This paper aims to introduce a strategic
   multi-product, multi-period design model for the manufacturing of an
   aircraft wing-box with a planning horizon of the full program duration.
   The supply chain systems consist of a number of external suppliers,
   candidate manufacturing sites, and a number of customers at fixed
   locations. The design model is a mixed-integer linear programming
   optimization routine that minimizes the total time-discounted network
   cost. The model generates a system configuration that specifies the
   location and capacity of the manufacturing sites, the material flow, and
   the transportation routes within the network. The model is implemented
   using open-source tools, and has a comprehensive and flexible data
   structure to support the decision-making process during the early
   aircraft design stages. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The configuration of complex systems to improve their efficiency
   (reward), risk, or a combination of both performance measures has long
   been a goal of systems engineering. This research focuses on designing
   supply chain systems where a large number of discrete configurations
   exist. The uncertainty of the future is modeled as a set of scenarios.
   The risk of the system is modeled as the standard deviation of the
   profits of the various scenarios, while the efficiency or reward of the
   system is computed as the expected value of the scenario profits. A
   configuration for which no other configuration exists that has both
   higher reward and lower risk is said to be Pareto-optimal. An optimizing
   algorithm that efficiently identifies all Pareto-optimal configurations
   of a supply chain is presented. A common risk mitigation strategy for
   supply chains is to increase the overall capacity of the supply chain by
   either constructing more facilities or by increasing the capacity of
   individual facilities. We then show through a numerical example, that
   this strategy does not always have the desired effect of reducing the
   risk. This observation is a new and counterintuitive managerial insight.

   The improved ``Jumping Snake{''} algorithm is used to extract feature
   points for lip model implementation, which makes the novel algorithm
   more accurate and flexible. It is also made more robust with the
   introduction of geometric constraints. Experiments show that this
   approach with geometric constraints provides satisfactory results. It
   can also serve as an initial attempt for further applications.}},

Abstract = {{Facilitating production process planning for product families, process
   platform planning (P-3) has been well recognized as an effective means
   of achieving production efficiency. To support decision making in P-3
   automation, this study adopts graph rewriting systems to 1) organize
   large volumes of product and process data and 2) model production
   process planning reasoning. The model developed represents the
   structural and behavioral aspects of process platforms as family graphs
   and related graph transformations, respectively. In view of its modeling
   advantage, the system is formally defined using PROGRES. It includes
   meta, generic, and instance models at three different levels of
   abstraction. Meta models are defined for family graphs to generalize the
   patterns common,to planning production processes for different product
   families; generic models are defined to describe entities pertaining to
   production processes of specific product families; instance models
   represent production processes producing product variants in a family.
   The graph rewriting system-based P-3 model is applied to textile
   spindles' production process planning. The results obtained have

Abstract = {{Background Increasingly, modern engineers are designing miniature
   devices that integrate complex activities, actions, processes, or
   operations involving many steps, persons, and equipment; a good example
   is a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device. The design of such devices is
   cognitively demanding and requires the generation of multiple model
   representations, which are used in an iterative fashion to analyze and
   improve prototype designs. Purpose This study addresses two questions:
   How are various representations and prototypes used in the iterative
   design and building of a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device in a systems
   biology laboratory? In this design process, what cognitive functions did
   the representations serve? Design/Method This case study employed mixed
   methods. We utilized the standard ethnographic methods of participant
   observation, open-ended interviewing of participants, and artifact
   collection in an integrated systems biology research lab. Data were
   analyzed using open and axial coding. We also used cognitive-historical
   analysis to collect and analyze data from traditional historical sources
   (publications, grant proposals, laboratory notebooks, and technological
   artifacts) to recover how the salient representational, methodological,
   and reasoning practices were developed and used by the researchers.
   Results The device design involved complex interactions among mental
   models, computational models, and building and testing prototypes;
   tagging and visualizations were used to query and validate the
   prototypes as well as the computational models; all these were
   integrated to meet stringent experimental and fabrication constraints.
   Integration takes place across many different kinds of representations.
   The building of external representations helped not just to off-load
   cognitive load but also to add detail and constraints to the mental
   model. Conclusions Representational fluency and flexibility are required
   to manage the complexity of modern bioengineered devices. To support the
   development of such fluency and flexibility, engineering students must
   understand the function and the use of such representations, an
   instructional goal that has implication for new models of learning.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with the Zr6O4(OH)(4) secondary building
   unit (SBU) have been of particular interest for potential commercial and
   industrial uses because they can be easily tailored and are reported to
   be chemically and thermally stable. However, we show that there are
   significant changes in chemical and thermal stability of Zr6O4(OH)(4)
   MOFs with the incorporation of different organic linkers. As the number
   of aromatic rings is increased from one to two in 1,4-benzene
   dicarboxylate (UiO-66, ZrMOF-BDC) and 4,4 `-biphenyl dicarboxylate
   (UiO-67, ZrMOF-BPDC), the Zr6O4(OH)(4) SBU becomes more susceptible to
   chemical degradation by water and hydrochloric acid. Furthermore, as the
   linker is replaced with 2,2 `-bipyridine-5,5 `-dicarboxylate
   (ZrMOF-BIPY) the chemical stability decreases further as the MOF is
   susceptible to chemical breakdown by protic chemicals such as methanol
   and isopropanol. The results reported here bring into question the
   superior structural stability of the UiO-67 analogs as reported by
   others. Furthermore, the degradation mechanisms proposed here may be
   applied to other classes of MOFs containing aromatic dicarboxylate
   organic linkers, in order to predict their structural stability upon
   exposure to solvents.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel way of fabricating solid-state, flexible,

   Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes

   MFC to serve as separator layer. The specific capacitance was calculated
   to be 154.5 mF cm(-2) at 20 mV s(-1) from cyclic voltammetry. This value
   is significantly higher than most flexible supercapacitors reported in
   the literature. The paper-based supercapacitors have excellent
   mechanical properties compared to the conventional liquid or gel based
   soft supercapacitors, with tensile strength being 1 MPa and Young's
   modulus being 123 MPa. Moreover, the specific capacitance remained the

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{3912-3917}},
Abstract = {{We report on the formation of hierarchical nanostructures of Au, PtOx,
   FexOy and PdOx using a hybrid technique by combining laser interference
   ablation (LIA) and block copolymer phase separation (BCPS). Different
   types of hierarchical arrays can be obtained including square,
   triangular, linear and circular arrays by varying the loading time of
   the block co-polymer with metallic salts, and the laser interference
   technique. The primary ordering of the as-generated nanoarrays (30-100
   nm) is tunable by changing either the composition of the block copolymer
   spun from solution or by changing other parameters that affect the phase
   separation kinetics of the block copolymer, while the secondary ordering
   of the features can be tuned from 200 nm to 2 mu m, by changing the
   angle of convergence of the laser beams on the patterned substrate. Such
   a robust method can be applied to the fabrication of other metallic and
   ceramic materials including Ag, Co, and Ni (O) and has potential use in
   the large scale fabrication of hierarchical arrays of catalysts that can
   be used to grow germanium, silicon nanowires using the
   vapour-liquid-solid growth (VLS) technique. The as-generated arrays can
   also find use in optical as well as sensor applications for biodetection

Abstract = {{This paper examines the manual control of systems with oscillatory
   dynamics. Tracking performance is improved by using input shaping to
   suppress command-induced oscillation. An operator study tested tracking
   behavior using controlled elements with both low-frequency (1.25 rad/s)
   and high-frequency (5 rad/s) oscillatory modes. After each experimental
   trial, measures of tracking performance and subjective task difficulty
   were recorded, and frequency-domain control characteristics were
   computed. Results showed that the high-frequency oscillatory mode did
   not greatly decrease the tracking performance from the nonoscillatory
   case; thus, input shaping did not produce a significant improvement in
   the tracking performance. However, input shaping did cause a decrease in
   the average subjective task difficulty and made the system closely
   resemble McRuer's ``crossover model.{''} For the low-frequency case, the
   addition of input shaping significantly improved the tracking
   performance and reduced the tracking difficulty. These results
   demonstrate that input shaping can greatly improve the continuous
   tracking ability of human-machine systems that have oscillatory modes.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex
   (pMHC) molecule by the T-cell receptor (TCR) determines T-cell
   selection, development, differentiation, fate, and function. Despite
   intensive studies on the structures, thermodynamic properties, kinetic
   rates, and affinities of TCR-pMHC interactions in the past two decades,
   questions regarding the functional outcome of these interactions, i.e.
   how binding of the ab TCR heterodimer with distinct pMHCs triggers
   different intracellular signals via the adjacent CD3 components to
   produce different T-cell responses, remain unclear. Most kinetic
   measurements have used surface plasmon resonance, a three-dimensional
   (3D) technique in which fluid-phase receptors and ligands are removed
   from their cellular environment. Recently, several two-dimensional (2D)
   techniques have been developed to analyze molecular interactions on live
   T cells with pMHCs presented by surrogate antigen-presenting cells or
   supported planar lipid bilayers. The insights from these in situ
   analyses have provided a sharp contrast of the 2D network biology
   approach to the 3D reductionist approach and prompted rethinking of our
   current views of T-cell triggering. Based on these insights, we propose
   a mechanochemical coupled triggering hypothesis to explain why the in
   situ kinetic parameters differ so much from their 3D counterparts, yet
   correlate so much better with T-cell functional responses.}},

   Hydrolysis of Cornstarch}},
Journal = {{AICHE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-83}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cationic polyacrylamides (c-PAMs) bind to starch granules and decrease
   the temperature for the onset of gelatinization by 8 degrees C. c-PAM
   increases the binding of alpha-amylase to cornstarch; the rate of
   cornstarch hydrolysis also increases. By analogy to previous work on the
   c-PAM promoted hydrolysis of cellulose, it is proposed that the polymer
   reduces the charge on the surface of starch through a charge-patch
   mechanism. Because both enzyme and substrate are negatively charged, the
   bound c-PAM reduces the charge repulsion experienced by the approaching
   enzyme, which leads to stronger enzyme-substrate binding and faster
   hydrolysis. Overall, the c-PAM reduces enzyme dose by up to 62\% under
   the conditions used. There is a mirror image relationship between the
   viscosity of the medium and the hydrolysis rate, which allows
   optimization of these parameters with enzyme and c-PAM dosage. Low c-PAM

Abstract = {{The NASA DC-8 aircraft characterized the aerosol properties, chemical
   composition, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations of the
   summertime Arctic during the 2008 NASA Arctic Research of the
   Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARC-TAS)
   campaign. Air masses characteristic of fresh and aged biomass burning,
   boreal forest, Arctic background, and anthropogenic industrial pollution
   were sampled. Observations were spatially extensive (50-85 degrees N and
   40-130 degrees W) and exhibit significant variability in aerosol and CCN
   concentrations. The chemical composition was dominated by highly
   oxidized organics (66-94\% by volume), with a water-soluble mass
   fraction of more than 50 \%. The aerosol hygroscopicity parameter,
   kappa, ranged between kappa = 0.08-0.32 for all air mass types.
   Industrial pollution had the lowest kappa of 0.08 +/- 0.01, while the
   Arctic background had the highest and most variable kappa of 0.32 +/-
   0.21, resulting from a lower and more variable organic fraction. Both
   fresh and aged (long-range transported) biomass burning air masses
   exhibited remarkably similar kappa (0.18 +/- 0.13), consistent with
   observed rapid chemical and physical aging of smoke emissions in the
   atmosphere, even in the vicinity of fresh fires. The organic
   hygroscopicity (kappa(org)) was parameterized by the volume fraction of
   water-soluble organic matter (epsilon(WSOM)), with a kappa = 0.12, such
   that kappa(org) = 0.12 `` WSOM. Assuming bulk (size-independent)
   composition and including the kappa(org) parameterization enabled CCN
   predictions to within 30\% accuracy for nearly all environments sampled.
   The only exception was for industrial pollution from Canadian oil sands
   exploration, where an external mixture and size-dependent composition
   was required. Aerosol mixing state assumptions (internal vs. external)
   in all other environments did not significantly affect CCN predictions;
   however, the external mixing assumption provided the best results, even
   though the available observations could not determine the true degree of
   external mixing and therefore may not always be representative of the
   environments sampled. No correlation was observed between kappa(org) and
   O: C. A novel correction of the CCN instrument supersaturation for water
   vapor depletion, resulting from high concentrations of CCN, was also
   employed. This correction was especially important for fresh biomass
   burning plumes where concentrations exceeded 1.5x10(4) cm(-3) and
   introduced supersaturation depletions of >= 25 \%. Not accounting for
   supersaturation depletion in these high concentration environments would
   therefore bias CCN closure up to 25\% and inferred kappa by up to 50 \%.}},

   heat transfer of water on copper surfaces has been conducted. The
   nanostructures on copper surfaces have been created by an

   copper surfaces show an increase in the CLIP of up to 142\% and an
   increase in the HTC of 33\% over that of a mirror-finished plain copper
   surface. Calculations for nucleation site density and active nucleation
   site diameter reveal a direct correlation between these factors and the
   HTC, as well as the CLIP. More interestingly, a contact angle study and
   active nucleation site calculation on the tested surfaces show that
   there are strong connections between the contact angle reduction and
   active nucleation site increase, and CLIP enhancement and HTC raise,
   which confirm the contact angle mechanism of CLIP and active nucleation

Abstract = {{Natural silk fibers were used as the template to synthesis biomorphic
   ZnO fibers. Silk fibers were first immersed into a Zn(NO3)(2) solution
   and then sintered in air at high temperatures to produce the final ZnO
   fibers. Their microstructures, phases, and synthesis process were
   analyzed. The results show that these synthesized fibers retained the
   morphologies of silk faithfully. The sintering temperatures had the
   effect on the continuity of the biomorphic fibers. The crystallite sizes
   of these biomorphic ZnO are in nano scale. The fabrication process of
   biomorphic ceramic included the formation of ZnO and removal of their
   silk templates. The ZnO formed before the removal of the silk-template,
   so that the fibrous morphology of the silk could be retained to this
   ZnO. The method of using bio-template could provide a new idea for the
   design of oxide fiber.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the monotone inclusion problem consisting of
   the sum of a continuous monotone map and a point-to-set maximal monotone
   operator with a separable two-block structure and introduce a framework
   of block-decomposition prox-type algorithms for solving it which allows
   for each one of the single-block proximal subproblems to be solved in an
   approximate sense. Moreover, by showing that any method in this
   framework is also a special instance of the hybrid proximal
   extragradient (HPE) method introduced by Solodov and Svaiter, we derive
   corresponding convergence rate results. We also describe some instances
   of the framework based on specific and inexpensive schemes for solving
   the single-block proximal subproblems. Finally, we consider some
   applications of our methodology to establish for the first time (i) the
   iteration-complexity of an algorithm for finding a zero of the sum of
   two arbitrary maximal monotone operators and, as a consequence, the
   ergodic iteration-complexity of the Douglas-Rachford splitting method
   and (ii) the ergodic iteration-complexity of the classical alternating
   direction method of multipliers for a class of linearly constrained
   convex programming problems with proper closed convex objective

Abstract = {{We investigate the operating voltage constraints and hot carrier
   reliability (HCR) of 45-nm SOI RF nMOSFETs and cascode cores built from
   these devices. The devices were implemented with both ``floating{''}
   body and ``contacted{''} body schemes. It is shown through experimental
   results that floating-body (FB) devices have greater hot carrier
   degradation compared with body-contacted (BC) devices. Cascode cores
   designed with two FB devices (FB-FB), with one BC device and one FB
   device (BC-FB), and with two BC devices (BC-BC), were also investigated.
   The trade-offs in the dc versus radio-frequency (RF) performance versus
   the HCR of these cascode cores were assessed. The cascode cores have a
   much longer reliability lifetime compared with a single device operating
   under similar stress conditions. The BC-BC cascode core is shown to have
   a much longer reliability lifetime compared with BC-FB and FB-FB cascode
   core topologies. The physical mechanisms behind the observed hot carrier
   degradation in these devices and cascode cores are explored using
   calibrated technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Taken
   together, these results suggest some important implications for
   realizing high-performance and high-reliability RF circuit designs using

Abstract = {{The thermal response of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
   directly correlates with the overall performance and reliability of
   these devices. In general, a hot spot develops near the drain end of the
   gate electrode during power dissipation. The device channel temperature
   was examined via micro-Raman spectroscopy under various bias conditions
   where power dissipation levels were identical. Under these bias
   conditions, difference in internal states (sheet carrier density and
   electric field distribution) within the device alters the heat
   generation profile across the channel. High V-ds conditions lead to
   significantly higher channel temperature compared to that for low V-ds
   conditions although the power dissipation is kept constant. Experimental
   results show similar to 13 degrees C deviation between V-ds = 45 V and
   V-ds = 7 V cases when the power dissipation is 4.5 W/mm. This suggests
   that bias conditions may have a relatively significant impact on device
   reliability and that this effect must be considered when building
   thermal models of devices under operation or undergoing accelerated life
   testing.}},

Title = {{Cu Interconnect Limitations and Opportunities for SWNT Interconnects at

Abstract = {{The historical understanding of the interconnect problem in electronics
   has been that the penalty due to the performance degradation of
   interconnects with technology scaling would be most severe for long
   interconnects at the global level. At the nanoscale, however, the nature
   of the interconnect problem changes and paves the way for new
   opportunities. This is because of the fact that the metal resistivity at
   small interconnect dimensions drastically increases due to size effects.
   In this paper, it is shown that the historical trend of achieving
   smaller interconnect latency for short local-and intermediate-level
   interconnects will not hold true for future technology nodes. This paper
   investigates new opportunities that rise as a consequence of this
   radical change in the nature of the interconnect problem. Contrary to
   the previous publications, which have indicated that individual
   single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) interconnects are too resistive for
   high-performance CMOS applications and must be used in bundles, this
   paper demonstrates that they can offer significant delay and
   energy-per-bit improvements in high-performance circuits at the end of
   the roadmap. Performances of various design scenarios that comprise one
   or a few parallel individual SWNT interconnects are compared against the
   performance of the conventional Cu/low-k interconnect technology at
   future technology nodes using delay, energy per bit, and energy-delay
   product as metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Analog LiNbO2 memristors are characterized using potentiodynamic
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is shown that LiNbO2-based
   devices exhibit analog memristive and meminductive or memcapacitive
   behavior depending on the applied frequency. The impedance spectra are
   fit to a circuit model whose elements correspond to ionic and electronic
   effects in the bulk and at the electrode-semiconductor interface. By
   separating out the bulk and interfacial effects, it is shown that the
   majority of the ionic movement in the cation-based analog memristor is
   at the interfaces. It is also shown that ionic capacitance results from
   a drift field-driven phase shift between the ac bias and the ionic
   motion, whereas the ionic inductance phase shift results from diffusion
   relaxation. Thus, to maximize resistance changes due to this ionic
   movement, analog memristors should be fabricated with negligible bulk
   dimensions.}},

Title = {{Sustainability assessment at the transportation planning level:
   Performance measures and indexes}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{10-21}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{While the definition of a sustainable transportation system is varied,
   there is emerging consensus that transportation system sustainability
   should capture attributes of system effectiveness and system impacts on
   economic development, environmental integrity, and social quality of
   life. Sustainability assessment can be incorporated at the planning
   level in order to influence decision making, and support policies that
   affect regional sustainability. This paper reviews methodologies that
   can be applied in sustainability assessment in transportation planning
   in order to shed light on the procedures being used to incorporate
   sustainability more effectively in the planning process. Using data from
   the Atlanta Metropolitan Region, the study identifies performance
   measures based on sustainability issues and regional goals and evaluates
   proposed transportation and land use alternatives. The study evaluates
   and discusses several performance measures and aggregates them into
   indexes representing four parameters of sustainability: system
   effectiveness, environmental, economic, and social impacts, to enable
   visualization and assessment of tradeoffs and dominance for the
   competing alternatives. This study is potentially useful to agencies
   interested in understanding the range of tools being used for
   sustainability assessment, expanding or refining their performance
   measures to capture sustainability in transportation planning, and using
   them in evaluating tradeoffs among competing alternatives as well as in
   identifying dominant alternatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{50-59}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cross-layer collision-tolerant (CT) media access
   control (MAC) scheme is proposed for wireless networks. Unlike
   conventional MAC schemes that discard and retransmit signals colliding
   at a receiver, the CT-MAC extracts the salient information from the
   colliding signals with a new on-off accumulative transmission (OOAT)
   scheme in the physical layer. Users employing OOAT deliver information
   to the base station (BS) through uncoordinated on-off transmissions of
   multiple identical sub-symbols (accumulative transmission). Silence
   periods are inserted between sub-symbols inside a frame to reduce
   collision probability and render a special signal structure for physical
   layer detection. Algebraic properties of the on-off transmission
   patterns, which are represented as cyclic-shifted binary vectors, are
   analyzed, and the results provide guidelines on the design of OOAT
   systems and other systems that rely on cyclic-shifted binary vectors.
   Then, we demonstrate that the structure of the on-off transmission
   patterns enables a sub-optimum iterative detection method, which
   improves performance by iteratively exchanging extrinsic soft
   information between a forward and a backward soft interference
   cancellation (SIC). Both analytical and simulation results show that the
   new CT-MAC with OOAT scheme significantly outperforms many existing
   cross-layer MAC schemes in terms of the number of users supported and
   the normalized throughput.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that projectiles equipped with liquid payloads
   experience large destabilizing moments induced by internal motion of the
   fluid. For some configurations, these moments may lead to catastrophic
   flight instabilities. This paper explores how payload geometry, fluid
   spin-up rate, and the magnitude of launch perturbations affect the
   flight trajectories of projectiles with a liquid payload, including
   projectile instability. A dynamic simulation model is used in which a
   projectile rigid-body dynamics representation incorporates liquid
   moments generated from linearized Navier-Stokes predictions. A novel
   feature of this simulation is its use of linear filtering within the
   model, which determines fast- and slow-mode angle-of-attack
   contributions at each time step to be used in computation of liquid
   moments. Example cases and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate how
   design factors and launch perturbations affect the projectile's tendency
   to exhibit flight instability. The paper concludes with a summary of
   advantageous design characteristics that are likely to mitigate the
   effects of destabilizing liquid moments.}},

Abstract = {{The seventh U.S.Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena was
   held in Shima, Japan, from December 11 to 14, 2011. The goals of this
   joint seminar were to provide a critical assessment of the state of the
   art and future directions in the field of nanoscale transport phenomena
   and energy conversion processes, to foster U.S.Japan collaborations, and
   to provide international exposure to a new generation of scientists in
   this field. Issues discussed in the joint seminar were organized in 10
   topical sessions, including (1) nanoscale thermophysical measurements;
   (2) optical characterization; (3) thermal and molecular transport; (4)
   phonon transport modeling; (5) energy storage and conversion; (6)
   nanoscale fluidics and phase change phenomena; (7) biological and
   organic systems; (8) interfacial thermal transport; (9) novel
   thermoelectric and thermal management materials; and (10) nanocarbon
   materials and devices. In addition to these topical sessions, the joint
   seminar featured an opening plenary session and a closing plenary
   session as well as an expert panel, where leading experts provided
   critical assessment of the past progress and addressed future directions
   in the field. In addition, an evening poster session provided
   opportunities for graduate and postdoc students to present their latest
   research results. About 35 researchers from Japan and 31 researchers
   from the United States participated in the meeting. The meeting was
   organized by S. Maruyama, K. Fushinobu, L. Shi, and J. Lukes together
   with about 20 other participants who served as session chairs. Summaries
   of different sessions of the seminar were prepared by the session and
   conference chairs and are collected into this report.}},

Abstract = {{Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) replenishment is a collaboration between
   a supplier and its customers, where the supplier is responsible for
   managing the customers' inventory levels. In the VMI setting we
   consider, the supplier exploits synergies between customers, e. g.,
   their locations, usage rates, and storage capacities, to reduce
   distribution costs. Due to the intricate interactions between customers,
   calculating a fair cost-to-serve for each customer is a daunting task.
   However, cost-to-serve information is useful when marketing to new
   customers or when revisiting routing and delivery quantity decisions. We
   design mechanisms for this cost allocation problem and determine their
   characteristics both analytically and computationally.}},

Abstract = {{For surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates with
   nonspherical symmetry, it is critical to correlate spectroscopy
   measurements with imaging by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   However, the deposition of carbon resulting from e-beam exposure during
   SEM imaging contaminates the surface of nanoparticles, potentially
   preventing their further functionalization with Raman probe molecules.
   In addition, the deposited carbon leads to unwanted background SERS
   signals. In this study, we systematically investigated the deposition of
   carbon during SEM imaging and examined how it affects the
   functionalization of nanoparticles with probe molecules and impacts the
   detection of SERS signals. Significantly, we found that the carbon could
   be removed or replaced from the surface of Ag nanoparticles through
   chemical or physical means, rendering the nanoparticles the capability
   for correlated SEM/SERS studies.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{52-63}},

Abstract = {{The structural assessment of welded joints requires that the weld metal
   and the heat-affected zone (HAZ) have adequate fracture toughness
   values. The measurement of these quantities is still controversial due
   to the inhomogeneous properties of the welds, which affects standardized
   methodologies. This work presents local measurements of the fracture
   toughness of the heat-affected zones from welded steel pipes. Fracture
   tests were performed inside the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using
   small specimens, allowing the direct measurement of the crack tip
   opening displacement (CTOD) on the surface. CTODs of approximately half
   a millimeter were attained for crack growth of about one-tenth of a
   millimeter before the crack crossed the fusion line. Three methods for
   computing the CTOD were compared, and the differences among the results
   were discussed. Furthermore, the surface strain field, calculated by
   measuring the distortion of a regular grid, showed evidence of an
   influence of HAZ inhomogeneity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{272-281}},
Abstract = {{Poly(arylene ether sulfone)-based ionomers with sulfonate groups of
   varying acidity (perfluoroalkyl sulfonate, aryl sulfonate and alkyl
   sulfonate) were synthesized via borylation of aromatic C-H bonds and
   Suzuki coupling with sulfonated phenyl bromides. Properties of the
   ionomers, such as thermal stability, water uptake, ion exchange
   capacity, morphology and proton conductivity, were analyzed with respect
   to the effect of the sulfonate group. Superacidic fluoroalkyl sulfonated
   ionomers displayed much higher conductivity at low relative humidity
   than less acidic aryl and alkyl sulfonated ionomers in spite of their
   lower ion exchange capacities. The water uptake of the membranes
   correlated with their IEC, regardless of the acid group identity. The
   membranes with fluoroalkyl and alkyl sulfonate groups had similar
   hydration numbers as a function of RH, but the hydration number of the
   aromatic sulfonate sample was greater than the other polymers. Ionic
   domain structure analysis by atomic force microscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that all
   of the aromatic ionomers in this study had a small, disorganized phase
   structure. These results demonstrate that the primary influence on the
   proton conductivity of these randomly sulfonated copolymers is the acid
   strength while the nanoscale domain structure plays a secondary role in
   the low RH proton transport.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of distributed convergence to efficient outcomes
   in coordination games through dynamics based on aspiration learning. Our
   first contribution is the characterization of the asymptotic behavior of
   the induced Markov chain of the iterated process in terms of an
   equivalent finite-state Markov chain. We then characterize explicitly
   the behavior of the proposed aspiration learning in a generalized
   version of coordination games, examples of which include network
   formation and common-pool games. In particular, we show that in generic
   coordination games the frequency at which an efficient action profile is
   played can be made arbitrarily large. Although convergence to efficient
   outcomes is desirable, in several coordination games, such as
   common-pool games, attainability of fair outcomes, i.e., sequences of
   plays at which players experience highly rewarding returns with the same
   frequency, might also be of special interest. To this end, we
   demonstrate through analysis and simulations that aspiration learning
   also establishes fair outcomes in all symmetric coordination games,
   including common-pool games.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3651-3660}},
Abstract = {{The assembly of cubic hollow microcapsules in an aqueous buffer solution
   had been studied in comparison with the traditional spherical
   microcapsules with both microcapsules assembled from identical
   components and having identical surface charges. We observed that the
   cubic microcapsules mainly form the highly compacted ``boxed{''}
   clusters with a number of microcubes controlled by ionic strengths in a
   sharp contrast to the spherical microcapsules for which the random
   branched chain structures are generally favored. The assembled spherical
   microcapsules create a large number of openings with extensive internal
   surface areas while the cubic microcapsules build close, compacted
   aggregates with densely packed units. The dimensions of the ``boxed{''}
   clusters from similarly charged cubic microcapsules are greatly
   stabilized by strong facet-to-facet interactions and can be tuned in a
   wide range by changing ionic strength. The chain spherical microcapsules
   are mobile and capable of reconfiguration due to the lower hydrophobic
   energy of attraction in contrast to compact, stable aggregates of cubic
   microcapsules. The dramatic differences in assembly of microcapsules
   with similar nature but different shapes point that the aggregation
   behavior in such dispersions might be dominated by shape geometry and
   alternation of facet-to-facet interactions.}},

Title = {{Salt-specific effects in aqueous dispersions of carbon nanotubes}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{3712-3719}},
Abstract = {{Tremendous progress has been made to stabilize carbon nanotube
   dispersions using surfactants, although many questions await answer to
   design surfactant formulations that selectively stabilize nanotubes
   mono-dispersed in diameter and chirality. Stimulated by recent
   experimental observations {[}J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2010, 132, 16165-16175],
   we attempt here to quantify how changing the counter-ion (Cs+ instead of
   Na+) affects the morphology of dodecyl sulfate surfactants adsorbed on
   carbon nanotubes. Using atomistic molecular dynamics we simulated
   aqueous cesium dodecyl sulfate (CsDS) adsorbed on (6,6), (12,12), and
   (20,20) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at ambient conditions.
   When compared to results for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), our results
   suggest that surface aggregates with Cs+ ions, compared to Na+, yield a
   more compact coverage of the nanotubes at the surfactant surface
   coverage of 0.25 nm(2) per headgroup, with the surfactant heads extended
   towards the bulk aqueous solution, and prevent water from accessing the
   nanotube surface. These morphological results suggest that CsDS should
   be more effective than SDS at stabilizing aqueous carbon nanotubes
   dispersions. More importantly, these results were obtained only for the
   (6,6) nanotubes simulated. For the wider nanotubes our simulations show
   limited, if any, differences in the morphology of the surfactant
   aggregates when the Na+ ions are substituted with Cs+ ones. To validate
   our results we measured experimental UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra for
   aqueous carbon nanotubes with diameters similar to that of (6,6) and of
   (12,12) nanotubes stabilized by SDS at increasing salt concentration
   (CsCl vs. NaCl). The results are indicative of changes in the surfactant
   self-assembled structure on the narrow nanotubes in the presence of Cs+
   ions, while data for the wider tubes only suggest salt-screening effects
   for both Na+ and Cs+ ions. The different salt-specific behavior observed
   for the surfactants adsorbed on narrow vs. wide carbon nanotubes could
   be exploited for the selective stabilization of mono-dispersed carbon
   nanotube samples, although a surfactant more effective than SDS should
   be used.}},

   aerosol}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2283-2297}},
Abstract = {{In a series of smog chamber experiments, the cloud condensation nuclei
   (CCN) activity of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from
   ozonolysis of beta-caryophyllene was characterized by determining the
   CCN derived hygroscopicity parameter, kappa(CCN), from experimental
   data. Two types of CCN counters, operating at different temperatures,
   were used. The effect of semi-volatile organic compounds on the CCN
   activity of SOA was studied using a thermodenuder.
   Overall, SOA was only slightly CCN active (with kappa(CCN) in the range
   0.001-0.16), and in dark experiments with no OH scavenger present,
   kappa(CCN) decreased when particles were sent through the thermodenuder
   (with a temperature up to 50 degrees C).
   SOA was generated under different experimental conditions: In some
   experiments, an OH scavenger (2-butanol) was added. SOA from these
   experiments was less CCN active than SOA produced in experiments without
   an OH scavenger (i.e. where OH was produced during ozonolysis). In other
   experiments, lights were turned on, either without or with the addition
   of HONO (OH source). This led to the formation of more CCN active SOA.
   SOA was aged up to 30 h through exposure to ozone and (in experiments
   with no OH scavenger present) to OH. In all experiments, the derived
   kappa(CCN) consistently increased with time after initial injection of
   beta-caryophyllene, showing that chemical ageing increases the CCN
   activity of beta-caryophyllene SOA. kappa(CCN) was also observed to
   depend on supersaturation, which was explained either as an evaporation
   artifact from semi-volatile SOA (only observed in experiments lacking
   light exposure) or, alternatively, by effects related to chemical
   composition depending on dry particle size.
   Using the method of Threshold Droplet Growth Analysis it was also
   concluded that the activation kinetics of the SOA do not differ
   significantly from calibration ammonium sulphate aerosol for particles
   aged for several hours.}},

Title = {{Sequentially pulsed fluid delivery to establish soluble gradients within
   a scalable microfluidic chamber array}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a microfluidic chamber array that generates soluble
   gradients using sequentially pulsed fluid delivery (SPFD). SPFD produces
   stable gradients by delivering flow pulses to either side of a chamber.
   The pulses on each side contain different signal concentrations, and
   they alternate in sequence, providing the driving force to establish a
   gradient via diffusion. The device, herein, is significant because it
   demonstrates the potential to simultaneously meet four important needs
   that can accelerate and enhance the study of cellular responses to
   signal gradients. These needs are (i) a scalable chamber array, (ii) low
   complexity fabrication, (iii) a non-shearing microenvironment, and (iv)
   gradients with low (near zero) background concentrations. The ability to
   meet all four needs distinguishes the SPFD device from flow-based and
   diffusion-based designs, which can only achieve a subset of such needs.
   Gradients are characterized using fluorescence measurements, which
   reveal the ability to change the curvature of concentration profiles by
   simple adjustments to pulsing sequence and flow rate. Preliminary
   experiments with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells demonstrate cell viability and
   indicate migrational and morphological responses to a fetal bovine serum
   gradient. Improved and expanded versions of this technology could form
   the basis of high-throughput screening tools to study cell migration,
   development, and cancer. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Based on systematic first principles calculations, we investigate Sr
   surface segregation (SSS) in La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-d (LSCF) (a typical
   perovskite ABO(3) compound), a bottleneck causing efficiency degradation
   of solid oxide fuel cells. We identify two basic thermodynamic driving
   forces for SSS and suggest two possible ways to suppress SSS: applying
   compressive strain and reducing surface charge. We show that compressive
   strain can be applied through doping of larger elements and surface
   coating; surface charge can be reduced through doping of higher-valence
   elements in the Sr- and B-site or lower-valence elements in the La-site
   and introducing surface A-site vacancies. The net effect of oxygen
   vacancy is to enhance SSS because its effect of increasing surface
   charge overrides its effect of inducing compressive strain, while Co
   substitution of Fe always enhances SSS because it induces tensile strain
   as well as increases surface charge. Our results explain the recent
   experimental observation of SSS suppression in LSCF by a
   La1-xSrxMnO3-delta (LSM) coating.}},

Abstract = {{A series of well-defined copolymer brushes, PS-g-P3HT, composed of a
   hydrophobic coil-like PS backbone and densely grafted rod-like P3HT side
   chains were successfully synthesized by a combination of the
   quasi-living Grignard metathesis (GRIM) method, reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), and click reaction. The
   molecular weight distribution of the resulting PS-g-P3HT copolymer
   brushes was rather narrow (polydispersity index, PDI < 1.2). The
   grafting efficiency was very high (i.e., the efficiency of all click
   reactions >96\%). The self-assembly of PS-g-P3HT at the air/water
   interface was explored using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Quite
   intriguingly, circular domain arrays composed of the non-crystallized
   P3HT nanofibers were observed at high surface pressure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of lane-changing in driver behavior
   by measuring (i) the induced transient behavior and (ii) the change in
   driver characteristics, i.e., changes in driver response time and
   minimum spacing. We find that the transition largely consists of a
   pre-insertion transition and a relaxation process. These two processes
   are different but can be reasonably captured with a single model. The
   findings also suggest that lane-changing induces a regressive effect on
   driver characteristics: a timid driver (characterized by larger response
   time and minimum spacing) tends to become less timid and an aggressive
   driver less aggressive. We offer an extension to Newell's car-following
   model to describe this regressive effect and verify it using vehicle
   trajectory data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-92}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Data interoperability between computer-aided design (CAD) systems
   remains a major obstacle in the information integration and exchange in
   a collaborative engineering environment. The use of CAD data exchange
   standards causes the loss of design intent such as construction history,
   features, parameters, and constraints, whereas existing research on
   feature-based data exchange only focuses on class-level feature
   definitions and does not support instance-level verification, which
   causes ambiguity in data exchange. In this paper, a hybrid ontology
   approach is proposed to allow for the full exchange of both feature
   definition semantics and geometric construction data. A shared base
   ontology is used to convey the most fundamental elements of CAD systems
   for geometry and topology, which is to both maximize flexibility and
   minimize information loss. A three-branch hybrid CAD feature model that
   includes feature operation information at the boundary representation
   level is constructed. Instance-level feature information in the form of
   the base ontology is then translated to local ontologies of individual
   CAD systems during the rule-based mapping and verification process. A
   combination of the Ontology Web Language (OWL) and Semantic Web Rule
   Language (SWRL) is used to represent feature classes and properties and
   automatically classify them by a reasoner in the target system, which
   requires no knowledge about the source system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A volatility basis set (VBS) approach for the simulation of secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA) formation is incorporated in the online coupled
   atmospheric model system COSMO-ART and applied over Europe during the
   EUCAARI May 2008 campaign. Organic aerosol performance is improved when
   compared to the default SOA module of COSMO-ART (SORGAM) against high
   temporal resolution aerosol mass spectrometer ground measurements. The
   impact of SOA on the overall radiative budget was investigated. The mean
   direct surface radiative cooling averaged over Europe is -1.2 Wm(-2),
   representing approximately 20\% of the total effect of aerosols on the
   radiative budget. However, responses are not spatially correlated with
   the radiative forcing, due to the nonlinear interactions among changes
   in particle chemical composition, water content, size distribution and
   cloud cover. These interactions initiated by the effect of SOA on
   radiation are found to result even in a positive forcing in specific
   areas. Further model experiments showed that the availability of
   nitrogen oxides slightly affects SOA production, but that the aging rate
   constant used in the VBS approximation and boundary concentrations
   assumed in the model should be carefully selected. The aging of SOA is
   found to reduce hourly nitrate levels by up to 30 \%, while the
   condensation of inorganic species upon pre-existing, SOA-rich particles
   results in a monthly average increase of 5\% in sulfate and ammonium
   formation in the accumulation mode.}},

Abstract = {{An alkaline -amylase gene from alkaliphilic Alkalimonas amylolytica was
   synthesized based on the preferred codon usage of Escherichia coli and
   Pichia pastoris, respectively, and then was expressed in the according
   heterologous host, E. coli BL21 (DE3) and P. pastoris GS115. The
   alkaline -amylase expressed in E. coli was designated AmyA, whereas that
   produced by P. pastoris was designated AmyB. The specific activity of
   AmyA and AmyB was 16.0 and 16.6 U/mg at pH 9.5 and 50 degrees C,
   respectively. The optimal pH and pH stability of AmyA and AmyB were
   similar, whereas the optimum temperature and thermal stability of AmyB
   were slightly enhanced compared with those of AmyA. The AmyA and AmyB
   had a similar melting temperature of 64 degrees C and the same catalytic
   efficiency (kcat/Km) of 2.0 x 106 L/(mol min). AmyA and AmyB were
   slightly activated by 1 mM Co2+, Ca2+, or Na+, but inhibited by all
   other metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Cu2+). Tween 80
   or Tween 60 (10\% (w/v)) had little influence on the stability of AmyA
   and AmyB, while the 10\% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate caused the
   complete loss of AmyA and AmyB activities. The AmyA and AmyB were stable
   in the presence of solid detergents (washing powder), while were less
   stable in liquid detergents. Under the optimal conditions in 3-L
   bioreactor, the extracellular AmyB activity reached 600 U/mL, which was
   about 10 times as that of AmyA. These results indicated that P. pastoris
   was a preferable host for alkaline -amylase expression and the produced
   alkaline -amylase had a certain application potential in solid
   detergents. (c) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{An asymmetric cell based on a proton conductor,
   BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb), with a well-defined patterned Pt
   electrode was prepared to study the kinetics and mechanism of the
   hydrogen oxidation reaction under typical conditions for fuel cell
   operation and hydrogen separation, including operating temperature and
   hydrogen partial pressure. Steady-state polarization curves were
   carefully analyzed to determine the apparent exchange current density,
   limiting current density, and charge transfer coefficients. The
   empirical reaction order, as estimated from the dependence of electrode
   polarization (R-p) and exchange current density on the partial pressure
   of hydrogen (P-H2), varied from 0.55 to 0.71. The results indicate that
   hydrogen dissociation contributes the most to the rate-limiting step of
   the hydrogen oxidation reaction taking place at the Pt-BZCYYb interface.
   At high current densities, surface diffusion of electroactive species
   appears to contribute to the rate-limiting step as well.}},

Abstract = {{A phase stability diagram of ruthenium-zirconium oxide (Ru-Sn-O) was

   analyses of the prepared films based on X-ray diffraction and

Abstract = {{The formation of a stable vascular network in a scaffold is one of the
   most challenging tasks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
   Despite the common use of porous scaffolds in these applications, little
   is known about the effect of pore size on the neovascularization in
   these scaffolds. Herein is fabricated poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)
   inverse opal scaffolds with uniform pore sizes of 79, 147, 224, and 312
   mu m in diameter and which are then used to systematically study
   neovascularization in vivo. Histology analyses reveal that scaffolds
   with small pores (<200 mu m) favor the formation of vascular networks
   with small vessels at high densities and poor penetration depth. By
   contrast, scaffolds with large pores (>200 mu m) favor the formation of
   vascular networks with large blood vessels at low densities and deep
   penetration depth. Based on the different patterns of vessel ingrowth as
   regulated by the pore size, a model is proposed to describe
   vascularization in a 3D porous scaffold, which can potentially serve as
   a guideline for future design of porous scaffolds.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Pages = {{778-785}},
Abstract = {{Physical mixtures of organic semiconductors are increasingly used for
   the development of new materials in thin film, organic electronic
   applications and their electronic properties are strongly affected by
   their morphology. Here, we report on studies of blends of an
   electron-donating small molecule, BTD-DTP, with the electron-acceptor
   polymer PNDI-2T and the correlations between their thermal behaviour,
   intermixing and thin film structure. A significant depression of the
   PNDI-2T melting point (DT - 111 degrees C) is observed upon increasing
   the small molecule content. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS)
   and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) of thin films of varying composition
   show an increase in the small molecule crystalline phase and reduction
   in the crystallite orientation distribution, as the small molecule to
   polymer ratio reaches similar to 50 : 50 wt. The domain sizes of the
   small molecule and polymer crystalline phases reach a minimum at the 50
   : 50 wt ratio as well, suggesting the formation of the phases leads to
   mutual limitation of their crystalline domain size. Comparison of the
   bulk and thin film properties shows a divergence in behaviour of the
   small molecule, which in the bulk exhibits only a monotonic decrease in
   melting point with addition of polymer, but which has an increase in
   crystallinity, from 20 to 50 wt\% PNDI-2T content.}},

Abstract = {{A series of dihalo- and bis-aroyl-substituted
   benzo{[}1,2-b:6,5-b']dithiophene-4,5-diones were synthesized, and their
   electronic, electrochemical, and electrical properties investigated.
   Synthetic strategies to increase (i) the conjugation length of the base
   molecular structure - through introduction of thiophene units bearing
   electronically neutral substituents (hydrogen or alkyl groups) or strong
   electron-withdrawing pentafluorobenzoyl group(s) - and (ii) the electron
   affinity - by moving to a benzo{[}1,2-d:4,3-d']bis(thiazole)-4,5-dione
   structure - were developed. Molecular packing in the single crystal was
   studied by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis, and this
   information was subsequently used in the determination of the electronic
   band structures, densities of states (DOS), effective transfer
   integrals, and effective charge-carrier masses via density functional
   theory (DFT) methods. The charge-carrier transport properties of the
   benzo{[}1,2-b:6,5-b']dithiophene-4,5-dione and
   benzo{[}1,2-d:4,3-d']bis(thiazole)-4,5-dione derivatives were

   field-effect transistors (OFETs) via both solution-processed and
   vacuum-deposited films.
   2,7-Bis-pentafluorobenzoyl-benzo{[}1,2-b:6,5-b']dithiophene-4,5-dione
   (10a) exhibited field-effect behavior with an average electron mobility
   mu(e) = 4.4 (+/- 1.7) x 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) when the active layer was
   vacuum-deposited, and a larger mu(e) = 6.9 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) when
   the active layer was solution-processed. These results are in stark
   contrast with the DFT-determined electronic band structure and effective
   mass, which indicate that the material possesses good intrinsic
   charge-carrier transport characteristics. The combined results reveal
   the importance of thin-film processing and that further processing
   refinements could lead to improved device performance. Only one material
   with benzo{[}1,2-d:4,3-d']bis(thiazole)-4,5-dione core,
   2,7-bis-(4-n-hexyl-thiophene-2-yl)-benzo{[}1,2-d:4,3-d']bis(thiazole)-4,
   5-dione (19d), showed average mu(e) = 8.2 x 10(-5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in
   OFET with solution-processed active layer. Unexpectedly, measurable hole
   transport was observed for
   2,7-bis-(5-n-nonyl-thiophen-2-yl)-benzo{[}1,2-b:6,5-b']dithiophene-4,5-d
   ione (19b) (mu(h) = 8.5 x 10(-5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and

Abstract = {{Through-silicon vias (TSVs), being one of the key enabling technologies
   for three dimensional (3D) integrated circuit (IC) stacking, silicon
   interposer technology, and advanced wafer level packaging (WLP), has
   attracted tremendous interest throughout the semiconductor industry.
   However, limited work addresses TSV reliability issue, and even less
   experimental failure analysis has been reported in the literatures.
   In this paper, TSV samples have been fabricated and tested under
   thermal-shock test from -55 degrees C to 125 degrees C. Various
   experimental techniques have been used to carry out the failure
   mechanism analysis. Both Cu/SiO2 interfacial separations and SiO2/Si
   cohesive cracking were identified at various locations along the
   Cu/SiO2/Si interfaces. Finite-element based fracture analysis models
   have also been developed to understand the interfacial/cohesive crack
   initiation and propagation. A centered finite difference approach (CFDA)
   based on Griffith's energy balance has been developed for the
   axisymmetric crack propagation analysis. Also, the virtual crack closure
   technique (VCCT) has been applied for the axisymmetric
   interfacial/cohesive crack analysis. Both methods match perfectly with
   each other for linear elastic analysis, and agree well for
   elastic-plastic analysis. The fracture analysis results match the
   experimental observations, and also provide insight on the reason behind
   different failure mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Characterization of Hall effect thruster propellant distributors with
   flame visualization}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A novel method for the characterization and qualification of Hall effect
   thruster propellant distributors is presented. A quantitative
   measurement of the azimuthal number density uniformity, a metric which
   impacts propellant utilization, is obtained from photographs of a
   premixed flame anchored on the exit plane of the propellant distributor.
   The technique is demonstrated for three propellant distributors using a
   propane-air mixture at reservoir pressure of 40 psi (gauge) (377 kPa)
   exhausting to atmosphere, with volumetric flow rates ranging from 15-145
   cfh (7.2-68 l/min) with equivalence ratios from 1.2 to 2.1. The
   visualization is compared with in-vacuum pressure measurements 1 mm
   downstream of the distributor exit plane (chamber pressure held below
   2.7 x 10(-5) Torr-Xe at all flow rates). Both methods indicate a
   non-uniformity in line with the propellant inlet, supporting the
   validity of the technique of flow visualization with flame luminosity
   for propellant distributor characterization. The technique is applied to
   a propellant distributor with a manufacturing defect in a known location
   and is able to identify the defect and characterize its impact. The
   technique is also applied to a distributor with numerous small orifices
   at the exit plane and is able to resolve the resulting non-uniformity.
   Luminosity data are collected with a spatial resolution of 48.2-76.1 mu
   m (pixel width). The azimuthal uniformity is characterized in the form
   of standard deviation of azimuthal luminosities, normalized by the mean
   azimuthal luminosity. The distributors investigated achieve standard
   deviations of 0.346 +/- 0.0212, 0.108 +/- 0.0178, and 0.708 +/- 0.0230
   mean-normalized luminosity units respectively, where a value of 0
   corresponds to perfect uniformity and a value of 1 represents a standard
   deviation equivalent to the mean. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy is optimal only when tumor
   cells are subjected to a maximum drug exposure. To increase the
   intratumoral drug concentration and thus the efficacy of chemotherapy, a
   thermoresponsive bubble-generating liposomal system is proposed for
   triggering localized extracellular drug delivery. The key component of
   this liposomal formulation is the encapsulated ammonium bicarbonate
   (ABC), which is used to create the transmembrane gradient needed for a
   highly efficient encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX). At an elevated
   temperature (42 degrees C), decomposition of ABC generates CO2 bubbles,
   creating permeable defects in the lipid Mayer that rapidly release DOX
   and instantly increase the drug concentration locally. Because the
   generated CO2 bubbles are hyperechogenic, they also enhance ultrasound
   imaging. Consequently, this new liposomal system encapsulated with ABC
   may also provide an ability to monitor a temperature-controlled drug
   delivery process.}},

Abstract = {{A nondestructive way to achieve remote, reversible, light-controlled
   tunable permeability of ultrathin shell microcapsules is demonstrated in
   this study. Microcapsules based on poly\{{[}2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]
   trimethylammonium iodide\} (PMETAI) star polyelectrolyte and poly(sodium
   4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) were prepared by a layer-by-layer (LbL)
   technique. We demonstrated stable microcapsules with controlled
   permeability with the arm number of a star polymer having significant
   effect on the assembly structure: the PMETAI star with 18 arms shows a
   more uniform and compact assembly structure. We observed that in
   contrast to regular microcapsules from linear polymers, the permeability
   of the star polymer microcapsules could be dramatically altered by
   photoinduced transformation of the trivalent hexacyanocobaltate ions
   into a mixture of mono- and divalent ions by using UV irradiation. The
   reversible contraction of PMETAI star polyelectrolyte arms and the
   compaction of star polyelectrolytes in the presence of multivalent
   counterions are considered to cause the dramatic photoinduced changes in
   microcapsule properties observed here. Remarkably, unlike the current
   mostly destructive approaches, the light-induced changes in microcapsule
   permeability are completely reversible and can be used for
   light-mediated loading/unloading control of microcapsules.}},

   thermal and mechanical energies. Using aligned ZnO nanowire arrays grown
   on the flexible polyester (PET) substrate, a ZnO poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) heterojunction solar cell was designed for harvesting solar
   energy. By integrating the NGs and the solar cells, a hybrid energy cell
   was fabricated to simultaneously harvest three different types of
   energies. With the use of a Li-ion battery as the energy storage, the
   harvested energy can drive four red light-emitting diodes (LEDs).}},

Abstract = {{A combined conformal coating and gas/solid reaction process has been
   used for the first time to convert porous anodic alumina templates into
   robust, freestanding, multi-wall titania nanotube (MWTNT) arrays that
   resist appreciable nanotube bundling upon drying. A sol-gel infiltration
   process was first used to apply a thin conformal titania coating to the
   alumina templates. After selective etching to generate a gap between the
   template and the titania coating, exposed alumina was converted into
   nanocrystalline titania via reaction with titanium tetrafluoride gas and
   then with humid oxygen. After selective dissolution of residual
   aluminum-bearing phases and drying, freestanding, non-agglomerated,
   wellaligned MWTNT arrays were generated (i.e., with coating-derived
   inner titania tubes resting inside reaction-derived outer titania
   tubes). When incorporated as aligned electrodes in dye-sensitized solar
   cells, the dye loading and power conversion efficiencies were higher by
   factors of 2.2 and 1.8, respectively, than for solar cells with
   single-wall titania nanotube array electrodes. By controlling the
   conditions used for alumina template formation, sol-gel coating, and
   gas/solid reaction, this hybrid process may be used to generate robust,
   uniformly aligned MWTNT arrays with dimensions and functional
   chemistries tailored for a variety of electrical, optical, chemical, or
   biochemical applications.}},

Title = {{Assemblies of silver nanocubes for highly sensitive SERS chemical vapor
   detection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2777-2788}},
Abstract = {{We suggest that silver nanocube (AgNC) aggregates within cylindrical
   pores (PAM-AgNC) can be employed as efficient nanostructures for highly
   efficient, robust, tunable, and reusable surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) substrates for trace level organic vapor detection
   which is a challenging task in chemical detection. We demonstrate the
   ability to tune both the detection limit and the onset of signal
   saturation of the substrate by switching the adsorption behavior of
   AgNCs between highly aggregated and more disperse by varying the number
   of adsorption-mediating polyelectrolyte bilayers on the pore walls of
   the membrane. The different AgNC distributions show large differences in
   the trace vapor detection limit of the common Raman marker benzenethiol
   (BT) and a widely used explosive binder N-methyl-4-nitroaniline (MNA),
   demonstrating the importance of the large electromagnetic field
   enhancement associated with AgNC coupling. The SERS substrate with
   highly aggregated AgNCs within the cylindrical pores allows for
   consistent trace detection of mid ppb (similar to 500) for BT analyte,
   and a record limit of detection of low ppb (similar to 3) for MNA vapors
   with an estimated achievable limit of detection of approximately 600
   ppt. The dispersed AgNC aggregates do not saturate at higher ppb
   concentrations, providing an avenue to distinguish between higher ppb
   concentrations and increase the effective range of the SERS substrate
   design. A comparison between the AgNC substrate and an electroless
   deposition substrate with silver quasi-nanospheres (PAM-AgNS) also
   demonstrates a higher SERS activity, and better detection limit, by the
   nanocube aggregates. This is supported by FDTD electromagnetic
   simulations that suggest that the higher integrated electromagnetic
   field intensity of the hot spots and the large specific interfacial
   areas impart greatly improved SERS for the AgNCs. Moreover, we
   demonstrated that the AgNC substrate can be reused multiple times
   without significant loss of SERS activity which opens up new avenues for
   in-field monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{A longstanding aim in the development of electrolytes has been to find
   dopants that give high proton conductivity coupled with good chemical

   conduction. We used first-principles calculations to address this topic
   in doped BaZrO3 with efficient methods to examine a wide range of
   possible dopants (Y, In, Ga, Sc, Nd, Al, Tl, Sm, Dy, La, Pm, Er, and
   Ho). These calculations correctly identify the doped BaZrO3 materials
   that are already known to have favorable properties, but also identify a
   number of promising materials that have not been examined previously. We
   investigated the physical origins of the trends in chemical stability
   and proton mobility among the different dopants. Our data allows us to
   consider several possible physical descriptors for characterizing doped
   perovskites as proton conductors.}},

   Density functional theory (DFT) approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the kaolinite surfaces and their
   interaction with beta-D-glucose and cellobiose using density functional
   theory calculations. We found that their molecular adsorption energy on
   kaolinite depends on i) the characteristics of the kaolinite surfaces
   such as the hydroxylated (001) surface or the siloxane (00 \$\$(1) over
   bar) surface and ii) a molecular orientation of the monomer on the
   surface. The adsorption energy of the beta-D-glucose and the cellobiose
   on the hydroxylated (001) surface are significantly greater (almost
   200\%) than that on the siloxane (00 \$\$(1) over bar) surface since the
   hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bond more efficiently than the oxygen
   in siloxane group. Through Mulliken population analysis, we found that
   the hydrogen bond formation induces charge redistribution of the
   kaolinite surfaces. Therefore, the hydroxylated (001) surface undergoes
   more significant charge redistribution due to more hydrogen bond
   formation with adsorbate molecules in comparison to the siloxane (00
   \$\$(1) over bar) surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Ring-Opening of 1,2-Epoxyhexane with Methanol}},
Journal = {{CHEMCATCHEM}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The regioselective ring-opening of 1,2-epoxyhexane with methanol as a
   nucleophile is studied using an array of different molecular Co-III
   catalysts, specifically trans-Co-III-salen-X (1-X; X = Cl-, OTs-, BF4-,
   SbF6-, PF6-), cis/trans-Co-III-salen-SbF6, Co-III-salphen-SbF6, and
   Co-III-porphyrin-SbF6. Catalytic studies show the nature of the ligand
   and counterion both play a significant role in influencing reaction
   rates, and to a lesser extent, the regioselectivity of the ring-opening
   reaction, with Co-III-porphyrin-SbF6 as the most active and
   Co-III-salphen-SbF6 the least active soluble molecular catalysts. Unlike
   in the classical epoxide hydrolytic kinetic resolution reaction,
   non-coordinating, non-nucleophilic counterions proved most effective,
   and trans-Co-III-salen-Cl, which gives very high initial rates in
   hydrolytic kinetic resolution, shows very low activity in epoxide
   ring-opening with methanol. Supported soluble and insoluble
   unsymmetrical trans-Co-III-salen-X catalysts are, thus, synthesized to
   evaluate cooperativity and stability of the Co-III-salen species towards
   epoxide ring-opening with methanol. Soluble supported
   trans-Co-III-salen-X (X=SbF6 and OTs) shows better activity and
   selectivity in the title reaction than monomeric trans-Co-III-salen-SbF6
   catalyst because of the cooperativity introduced through the catalyst
   design. The stability of insoluble catalysts is evaluated by catalytic
   recycling experiments. The supported insoluble catalysts successfully
   are recovered and reused up to 5 times, showing reduced activity but
   unchanged selectivity after each cycle. Deactivation is attributed to
   several different causes based on elemental analysis and UV/Vis
   spectroscopic analysis of the used catalysts, with counterion and cobalt
   loss playing major roles.}},

Abstract = {{A series of squaraine-based sensitizers with various p bridges and
   anchors were prepared and examined in dye-sensitized solar cells. The
   carboxylic anchor group was attached onto a squaraine dye through p
   bridges with and without an ethynyl spacer. DFT studies indicate that
   the LUMO is delocalized throughout the dyes, whilst the HOMO resides on
   the squaraine core. The dye that incorporates a
   4,4-di-n-hexyl-cyclopentadithiophene group that is directly attached
   onto the p bridge, JD10, exhibits the highest power conversion
   efficiency in a DSC; this result is attributed, in part, to the
   deaggregative properties that are associated with the gem-di-n-hexyl
   substituents, which extend above and below the p-conjugated dye plane.
   Dye JD10 demonstrates a power-conversion efficiency of 7.3?\% for
   liquid-electrolyte dye-sensitized solar cells and 7.9?\% for cells that
   are co-sensitized by another metal-free dye, D35, which substantially
   exceed the performance of any previously tested squaraine sensitizer. A
   panchromatic incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency curve is
   realized for this dye with an excellent short-circuit current of 18.0
   mA?cm-2. This current is higher than that seen for other squaraine dyes,
   partially owing to a high molar absorptivity of >5?000?M-1?cm-1 from 400
   nm to the long-wavelength onset of 724 nm for dye JD10.}},

Abstract = {{An important factor determining the performance of delay tolerant
   networks (DTNs) is packet delivery delay. In this paper, we study the
   block delivery delay of DTN with the epidemic routing scheme based on
   random linear network coding (RLNC). First, simulations show that the
   influence of relay buffer size on the delivery delay is not as strong in
   RLNC-based routing as it is in replica-based routing. With this
   observation,we can simplify the performance analysis by constraining the
   buffer of the relay node to just one size. Then we derive the cumulative
   distribution function (CDF) of block delivery delay with difference
   equations. Finally, we validate the correctness of our analytical
   results by simulations.}},

Title = {{Quantitative screening of genes regulating tryptophan hydroxylase
   transcription in Caenorhabditis elegans using microfluidics and an
   adaptive algorithm}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{372-380}},
Abstract = {{Forward genetic screening via mutagenesis is a powerful method for
   identifying regulatory factors in target pathways in model organisms
   such as the soil-dwelling free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
   (C. elegans). Currently manual microscopy is the standard technique for
   conducting such screens; however, it is labor-intensive and
   time-consuming because screening requires imaging thousands of animals.
   Recently microfluidic chips have been developed to increase the
   throughput of some of such experiments; nonetheless, most of these chips
   are multilayer devices and complicated to fabricate and therefore prone
   to failure during fabrication and operation. In addition, most sorting
   decisions are made manually and the criteria used for sorting are
   subjective. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simple
   single-layer microfluidic device and an adaptive algorithm to make
   sorting decisions. The one-layer device greatly improves the
   reliability, while quantitative analysis with the adaptive algorithm
   allows for the identification of mutations that generate subtle changes
   in expression, which would have been hard to detect by eye. The
   screening criterion is set based on the mutagenized population, not
   separate control populations measured prior to actual screening
   experiments, to account for stochasticity and day-to-day variations of
   gene expression in mutagenized worms. Moreover, during each experiment,
   the threshold is constantly updated to reflect the balance between
   maximizing sorting rate and minimizing false-positive rate. Using this
   system, we screened for mutants that have altered expression levels of
   tryptophan hydroxylase, a key enzyme for serotonin synthesis in a CaMKII
   gain-of-function background. We found several putative mutants in this
   screen. Furthermore, this microfluidic system and quantitative analysis
   can be easily adapted to study other pathways in C. elegans.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel geodesic-active-contour-based (GAC-based) variational

   ventricles and the epicardium in short-axis magnetic resonance (MR)
   images. For the right ventricle, the myocardial wall is typically very
   thin and hard to identify using the resolution of existing MR scanners.
   We propose to use two level sets to identify both the endocardial wall
   by pushing away one level-set function from another, in the setting of
   the edge-driven GAC model with a new edge detection function. Existing
   edge detection functions have strict restrictions on the location of
   initial contours. We develop a new edge detection function that relaxes
   this restriction and propose an iterative method that uses a sequence of
   edge detection functions to minimize the energy of our model
   successively. Experimental results are presented to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{We assess the accuracy of basis set truncations based on natural
   orbitals determined by second-order perturbation theory for computing
   noncovalent interaction energies with coupled cluster through
   perturbative triples {[}CCSD(T)]. We consider two methods for
   truncation: (i) the usual frozen natural orbital approach (FNO) in which
   the basis set truncation occurs before the iterative CCSD computation
   {[}FNO CCSD(T)] and (ii) an approach in which the truncation occurs only
   for the perturbative triples contribution {[}CCSD+FNO(T)]. The errors
   incurred are comparable for both methods and are small enough for the
   methods to be used for benchmark-quality studies of noncovalent
   interactions. For the FNO CCSD(T) method with a modest natural orbital
   occupation tolerance of 10(-5), the mean absolute error in the
   interaction energies for the S22 data set in an aug-cc-pVDZ basis set is
   only 0.012 kcal mol(-1) versus canonical CCSD(T) values. The same method
   exhibits a mean absolute error of 0.020 kcal mol(-1) for the S11 data

Abstract = {{Selecting a suitable project manager for construction projects is one of
   the most important decisions made by construction firms. In the
   traditional approach, interviews are conducted by senior managers of the
   company, who consider the project requirements and the candidates'
   capabilities. However, interviewing candidates is usually time consuming
   and there is the risk of impaired judgment, leading to human error.
   Decision-making support systems are therefore very useful. In previous
   work, the authors proposed a fuzzy system to address the issues
   described above (Rashidi et al. 2011). In this paper, a simpler robust
   model is presented. The advantages of this new model lie in its
   simplicity and the fact that it is not necessary to consider many
   criteria in the selection procedure when using this model. This model
   only requires 15 fields of candidate information. In the development of
   this model, the first step is construction of an initial fuzzy model
   based on all the criteria that may be considered when selecting a
   project manager. The significance of the coefficients of the criteria
   are then determined. In the next step, the model is optimized by
   changing the number of fuzzy rules and reducing the number of criteria.
   Finally, the most appropriate model is chosen on the basis of the least
   number of criteria required to obtain accurate results. To show the
   model's capability, it is used in real interviews. The obtained results
   indicate the high accuracy of the model in predicting the output, that
   is, the best candidate in the interviews.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method is proposed for the minimum-time travel of a
   fixed-wing aircraft along a prescribed geometric path. The method checks
   the feasibility of the path, namely, whether it is possible for the
   aircraft to travel along the path without violating the state or control
   constraints. If the path is feasible, the method subsequently finds a
   semi-analytical solution of the speed profile that minimizes the travel
   time along the path. The optimal speed profile is then used to time
   parameterize the path and generate the state trajectory along with the
   control histories via inverse dynamics. Two algorithms for the
   time-optimal parameterization are proposed. Numerical examples are
   presented to demonstrate the validity, numerical accuracy, and
   optimality of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the opportunities for managing uncertainty in
   simulation-based design of multiscale systems are explored using
   constructs from information management and robust design. A
   comprehensive multiscale design problem, the concurrent design of
   material and product is used to demonstrate our approach. The desired
   accuracy of the simulated performance is determined by the trade-off
   between computational cost for model refinement and the benefits of
   mitigated uncertainty from the refined models. Our approach consists of
   integrating: (i) a robust design method for multiscale systems and (ii)
   an improvement potential based approach for quantifying the cost-benefit
   trade-off for reducing uncertainty in simulation models. Specifically,
   our approach focuses on allocating resources for reducing model
   parameter uncertainty arising due to insufficient data from simulation
   models. Using this approach, system level designers can efficiently
   allocate resources for sequential simulation model refinement in
   multiscale systems. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006186]}},

Abstract = {{McKay JL, Welch TD, Vidakovic B, Ting LH. Statistically significant
   contrasts between EMG waveforms revealed using wavelet-based functional
   ANOVA. J Neurophysiol 109: 591-602, 2013. First published October 24,
   2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00447.2012.-We developed wavelet-based functional
   ANOVA (wfANOVA) as a novel approach for comparing neurophysiological
   signals that are functions of time. Temporal resolution is often
   sacrificed by analyzing such data in large time bins, increasing
   statistical power by reducing the number of comparisons. We performed
   ANOVA in the wavelet domain because differences between curves tend to
   be represented by a few temporally localized wavelets, which we
   transformed back to the time domain for visualization. We compared
   wfANOVA and ANOVA performed in the time domain (tANOVA) on both
   experimental electromyographic (EMG) signals from responses to
   perturbation during standing balance across changes in peak perturbation
   acceleration (3 levels) and velocity (4 levels) and on simulated data
   with known contrasts. In experimental EMG data, wfANOVA revealed the
   continuous shape and magnitude of significant differences over time
   without a priori selection of time bins. However, tANOVA revealed only
   the largest differences at discontinuous time points, resulting in
   features with later onsets and shorter durations than those identified
   using wfANOVA (P < 0.02). Furthermore, wfANOVA required significantly
   fewer (similar to 1/4x; P < 0.015) significant F tests than tANOVA,
   resulting in post hoc tests with increased power. In simulated EMG data,
   wfANOVA identified known contrast curves with a high level of precision
   (r(2) = 0.94 +/- 0.08) and performed better than tANOVA across noise
   levels (P < < 0.01). Therefore, wfANOVA may be useful for revealing
   differences in the shape and magnitude of neurophysiological signals
   (e.g., EMG, firing rates) across multiple conditions with both high
   temporal resolution and high statistical power.}},

Title = {{Trajectory mining from anonymous binary motion sensors in Smart
   Environment}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{346-356}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{One of the key applications of Smart Environment (which is deployed with
   anonymous binary motion sensors {[}1,2]) is user activity behavior
   analysis. The necessary prerequisite to finding behavior knowledge of
   users is to mine trajectories from the massive amount of sensor data.
   However, it becomes more challenging when the Smart Environment has to
   use only non-invasive and binary sensing because of user privacy
   protection. Furthermore, the existing trajectory tracking algorithms
   mainly deal with tracking object either using sophisticated invasive and
   expensive sensors {[}3,4], or treating tracking as a Hidden Markov Model
   (HMM) which needs adequate training data set to obtain model's parameter
   {[}5]. So, it is imperative to propose a framework which can distinguish
   different trajectories only based on collected data from anonymous
   binary motion sensors. In this paper, we propose a framework - Mining
   Trajectory from Anonymous Binary Motion Sensor Data (MiningTraMo) - that
   can mine valuable and trust-worthy motion trajectories from the massive
   amount of sensor data. The proposed solution makes use of both temporal
   and spatial information to remove the system noise and ambiguity caused
   by motion crossover and overlapping. Meanwhile, MiningTraMo introduces
   Multiple Pairs Best Trajectory Problem (MPBT), which is inspired by the
   multiple pairs shortest path algorithm in {[}6], to search the most
   possible trajectory using walking speed variance when there are several
   trajectory candidates. The time complexity of the proposed algorithms
   are analyzed and the accuracy performance is evaluated by some designed
   experiments which not only have ground truth, but also are the typical
   situation for real application. The mining experiment using real history
   data from a smart workspace is also finished to find the user's behavior
   pattern. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2403-2411}},
Abstract = {{Oligonucleotides hold great promise as a recognition-based biomaterials
   assembly and disassembly tool. Chemically modified oligonucleotides such
   as locked nucleic acids (LNA) provide the added advantage of nuclease
   resistance. In the current study, we focus on programming the assembly
   and disassembly of LNA-linked colloidal particles as a function of
   sequence composition. We find that incorporation of LNA residues
   (similar to 30\%) into either one or both primary hybridization partner
   strands results in a higher duplex density than for isosequential DNA
   strands. Mismatched primary hybridization partners with sequence length
   of 11-15 bases have similar initial primary duplex densities. The
   displacement of mismatched strands by 15 base-long, perfectly matched
   competitive target strands, however, does depend on the base length of
   the original mismatched partner strand. Confocal microscopy confirms
   that substantial colloidal assembly occurs for both perfectly matched
   and mismatched LNA sequences that are 9 bases in length. Extensive
   disassembly for the mismatched case is then triggered through the
   introduction of 15 base-long competitive target strands. Our work
   demonstrates that LNA can be used to programmatically assemble and
   disassemble colloidal particles.}},

Abstract = {{The load-carrying and energy dissipation capacities of ultra-high
   performance concrete (UHPC) under dynamic loading are evaluated in
   relation to microstructure composition at strain rates on the order of
   10(5) s(-1) and pressures of up to 10 GPa. Analysis focuses on
   deformation and failure mechanisms at the mesostructural level. A
   cohesive finite element framework that allows explicit account of
   constituent phases, interfaces, and fracture is used. Three modes of
   energy dissipation are tracked, Le., inelastic deformation, distributed
   cracking, and interfacial friction. Simulations are carried out over a
   range of volume fractions of constituent phases. Results show that (1)
   volume fractions of the constituents have more influence on the
   energy-dissipation than load-carrying capacity, (2) inelastic
   deformation is the source of over 70\% of the energy dissipation, and
   (3) the presence of porosity changes the role of fibers in the
   dissipation process. Microstructure-behavior relations are established
   to facilitate materials design for target-specific applications. (C)

Abstract = {{The environmental risk assessment of toxic chemicals in stream water
   requires the use of a low cost standardized toxicity bioassay. Here, a
   biosensor for detection of toxic chemicals in stream water was studied
   using sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in continuous mode. The biosensor
   depends on the ability of SOB to oxidize sulfur particles under aerobic
   conditions to produce sulfuric acid. The reaction results in an increase
   in electrical conductivity (EC) and a decrease in pH. The biosensor is
   based on the inhibition of SOB in the presence of toxic chemicals by
   measuring changes in EC and pH. We found that the SOB biosensor can
   detect Cr6+ at a low concentration (50 ppb) which is lower than many
   whole-cell biosensors. The effect of organic material in real stream
   water on SOB activity was studied. Due to the presence of mixotrophic
   SOB, we found that the presence of organic matter increases SOB activity
   which decreases the biosensor start up period. Low alkalinity (22 mg L-1
   CaCO3) increased effluent EC and decreased effluent pH which is optimal
   for biosensor operation. While at high alkalinity (820 mg L-1 CaCO3, the
   activity of SOB little decreased. We found that system can detect 50 ppb
   of Cr6+ F at low alkalinity (22 mg L-1 CaCO3) in few hours while,
   complete inhibition was observed after 35 h of operation at high
   alkalinity (820 mg L-1 CaCO3. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   The control of the migration interval is studied considering a 256-core

Abstract = {{Existing antenna and array systems for 60-GHz wireless personal area
   network communications suffer from inherent poor radiation at grazing
   angles. This limitation is overcome in this work with a highly
   integrated antenna module that combines both broadside and end-fire
   radiators in a single multilayer organic package. Liquid crystal polymer
   and Rogers RO3003 are used to implement a small form factor (12.5 mm x
   10 mm x 1.3 mm) antenna architecture. The co-designed broadside and
   end-fire antennas are characterized and measured for operation in the
   57-66-GHz frequency range. Measured boresight gains of 8.7 and 10.9 dBi
   are achieved for the broadside and end-fire antennas while maintaining
   35-45-dB isolation between both antennas. The numerically estimated
   radiation efficiency is found to be 92.5\% and 78.5\% for the broadside
   and end-fire elements. These antennas are orthogonally polarized and
   suitable for frequency reuse. Integrated circuits are mounted inside
   recessed cavities to realize a fully active antenna module with beam
   switching or simultaneous radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first publication of a single package multilayer integration of
   millimeter-wave active antennas with both azimuth and elevation

Abstract = {{Safavynia SA, Ting LH. Sensorimotor feedback based on task-relevant
   error robustly predicts temporal recruitment and multidirectional tuning
   of muscle synergies. J Neurophysiol 109: 31-45, 2013. First published
   October 24, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00684.2012.-We hypothesized that motor
   outputs are hierarchically organized such that descending temporal
   commands based on desired task-level goals flexibly recruit muscle
   synergies that specify the spatial patterns of muscle coordination that
   allow the task to be achieved. According to this hypothesis, it should
   be possible to predict the patterns of muscle synergy recruitment based
   on task-level goals. We demonstrated that the temporal recruitment of
   muscle synergies during standing balance control was robustly predicted
   across multiple perturbation directions based on delayed sensorimotor
   feedback of center of mass (CoM) kinematics (displacement, velocity, and
   acceleration). The modulation of a muscle synergy's recruitment
   amplitude across perturbation directions was predicted by the projection
   of CoM kinematic variables along the preferred tuning direction(s),
   generating cosine tuning functions. Moreover, these findings were robust
   in biphasic perturbations that initially imposed a perturbation in the
   sagittal plane and then, before sagittal balance was recovered,
   perturbed the body in multiple directions. Therefore, biphasic
   perturbations caused the initial state of the CoM to differ from the
   desired state, and muscle synergy recruitment was predicted based on the
   error between the actual and desired upright state of the CoM. These
   results demonstrate that that temporal motor commands to muscle
   synergies reflect task-relevant error as opposed to sensory inflow. The
   proposed hierarchical framework may represent a common principle of
   motor control across motor tasks and levels of the nervous system,
   allowing motor intentions to be transformed into motor actions.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-assisted Chemical Etching of silicon has recently emerged as a
   powerful technique to fabricate 1D, 2D, and 3D nanostructures in silicon
   with high feature fidelity. This work demonstrates that out-of-plane
   rotational catalysts utilizing polymer pinning structures can be
   designed with excellent control over rotation angle. A plastic
   deformation model was developed establishing that the catalyst is driven
   into the silicon substrate with a minimum pressure differential across
   the catalyst thickness of 0.4-0.6 MPa. Force-displacement curves were
   gathered between an Au tip and Si or SiO2 substrates under acidic
   conditions to show that Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO)
   based forces are capable of providing restorative forces on the order of
   0.2-0.3 nN with a calculated 11-18 MPa pressure differential across the
   catalyst. This work illustrates that out-of-plane rotational structures
   can be designed with controllable rotation and also suggests a new model
   for the driving force for catalyst motion based on DLVO theory. This
   process enables the facile fabrication of vertically aligned thin-film
   metallic structures and scalloped nanostructures in silicon for

Abstract = {{Sperm and eggs are essential cells for reproduction and fertility in
   mammals. Lack of sperm production is one of the leading causes of
   infertility, a major and growing problem in the developed world
   affecting 13 to 18\% of reproductive-age couples. The birth of the first
   test tube baby by in vitro fertilization marked an advance in
   infertility treatment. Later on, several important new techniques called
   assisted reproductive technologies were developed to help couples who
   experience infertility. One limiting factor is the requirement of
   reproductive cells (gametes) for use in in vitro fertilization. For
   azoospermic men lacking sperm cells, producing gametes in vitro could be
   a new window to overcome infertility. In the past few years, several
   reports have been published on generating germ cells from stem cells,
   one of the epitomes of which was the report on functional in
   vitro-derived (IVD) germ cells. These mature haploid sperm cells from
   mouse embryonic stem cells were capable of egg fertilization and
   producing live offspring. In tandem with previous advancements in germ
   cell research, development of new technologies based on IVD gametes will
   change the future of infertility and provide a new basis for the
   establishment of novel therapeutic approaches to cure more complicated
   conditions of infertility. In addition, IVD gametogenesis provides an
   accessible system for studying the specification and differentiation of
   sperm cells and related processes such as meiosis, morphogenesis, and
   motility.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic plastic deformation in columnar-grained copper in which
   preferentially oriented nanoscale twins are embedded is studied by
   experimental testing, crystal plasticity modeling and molecular dynamics
   simulations. The dominant deformation mechanism can be effectively
   switched among three dislocation modes, namely dislocation glide in
   between the twins, dislocation transfer across twin boundaries, and
   dislocation-mediated boundary migration, by changing the loading
   orientation with respect to the twin planes. The controllable switching
   of deformation mechanisms not only leads to a marked dependence of yield
   strength on loading orientation, but also induces a strong orientation
   dependence of strain hardening that can be critical for retaining
   tensile ductility. These results demonstrate a new route for tailoring
   both nanostructure and loading to control the deformation mechanisms in
   order to achieve the desired mechanical properties in engineering
   materials. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dendrimers feature a defined number of terminal groups that may bind RNA
   or be functionalized with bioactive molecules. These competing uses of
   terminal groups may create an impasse if the requisite density of
   ligands depletes the number of terminal groups for binding sufficient
   RNA, or vice versa. A novel dendrimeric platform is needed that
   maintains high ligand density while retaining sufficient
   microRNA-binding terminal groups. Here we present a dendrimeric
   ``bowtie{''} consisting of one-half devoted to microRNA binding and the
   other half to ligand presentation. We demonstrate its suitability as a
   transfection agent by delivering miR-126 to human vascular endothial
   cells (HUVECs) via polyarginine- and RGD-modified bowties and evaluating
   the downstream effects on proliferation and tube formation. Our findings
   indicate that the bowtie elicits desired responses and may possess
   superior delivery properties compared to nondecorated dendrimeric
   materials. The bowtie system thereby provides a new design model for
   developing dendrimeric delivery vehicles for RNAi therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{As environmental issues threaten the widespread use of fossil fuels,
   Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles are explored as an alternative to

   passenger fatalities and injuries. The most probable causes of failure
   of the CNG vehicles are fire and vessel fracture. In this research, the
   cause of vessel failure is investigated through formal inspection and
   engineering test procedures. Specifically, the failure mechanism will be
   identified by fractography, and the material properties of a reference
   part will be investigated through the instrumented indentation

Abstract = {{N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are critical regulators of host
   defense in phagocytes and are also expressed in epithelia. FPR signaling
   and function have been extensively studied in phagocytes, yet their
   functional biology in epithelia is poorly understood. We describe a
   novel intestinal epithelial FPR signaling pathway that is activated by
   an endogenous FPR ligand, annexin A1 (ANXA1), and its cleavage product
   Ac2-26, which mediate activation of ROS by an epithelial NADPH oxidase,
   NOX1. We show that epithelial cell migration was regulated by this
   signaling cascade through oxidative inactivation of the regulatory
   phosphatases PTEN and PTP-PEST, with consequent activation of focal
   adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. In vivo studies using intestinal
   epithelial specific Nox1(-/-IEC) and AnxA1(-/-) mice demonstrated
   defects in intestinal mucosal wound repair, while systemic
   administration of ANXA1 promoted wound recovery in a NOX1-dependent
   fashion. Additionally, increased ANXA1 expression was observed in the
   intestinal epithelium and infiltrating leukocytes in the mucosa of
   ulcerative colitis patients compared with normal intestinal mucosa. Our
   findings delineate a novel epithelial FPR1/NOX1-dependent redox
   signaling pathway that promotes mucosal wound repair.}},

Abstract = {{As-built spatial data are useful in many construction-related
   applications, such as quality control and progress monitoring. These
   data can be collected using a number of imaging and time-of-flight-based
   (e. g., laser scanning) sensor methods. Each application will demand a
   particular level of data accuracy and quality, yet little information is
   available to help engineers choose the most cost-effective approach.
   This paper presents an analytical and quantitative comparison of
   photogrammetric, videogrammetric, and time-of-flight-based methods. This
   comparison is done with respect to accuracy, quality, time efficiency,
   and cost. To this end, representative image-based three-dimensional
   reconstruction software and commercially available hardware (two cameras
   and a time-of-flight-based laser scanner) are evaluated. Spatial data of
   typical infrastructure (two bridges and a building) are collected under
   different settings. The experimental parameters include camera type,
   resolution, and shooting distance for the imaging sensors. By comparing
   these data with the ground truth collected by a total station, it is
   revealed that video/photogrammetry can produce results of moderate
   accuracy and quality but at a much lower cost as compared to laser
   scanning. The obtained information is useful to help engineers make
   cost-effective decisions and help researchers better understand the
   performance impact of these settings for the sensor technologies. DOI:

Abstract = {{We report an array of polymeric nanowires for effectively immobilizing
   biomolecules on biochips owing to the large surface area. The nanowires
   were fabricated in predesigned patterns using an inductively coupled
   plasma (ICP) etching process. Microfluidic biochips integrated using the
   substrates with arrays of nanowires and polydimethylsiloxane channels
   have been demonstrated to be effective for detecting antigens, and a
   detection limit of antigens at 0.2 mu g mL(-1) has been achieved, which
   is improved by a factor of 50 compared to that based on flat substrates
   without the nanowires. In addition, the high sensitivity for clinical
   detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody has also been
   demonstrated, showing a 20 times enhancement in fluorescent signal
   intensity between the samples with positive and negative HIV.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between nanoparticles (NPs) and DNA is of significance
   for both application and implication research of NPs. In this study, a
   single-molecule imaging technique based on atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   was employed to probe the NP-DNA interactions with quantum dots (QDs) as
   model NPs. Reproducible high-quality images of single DNA molecules in
   air and in liquids were acquired on mica by optimizing sample
   preparation conditions. Furthermore, the binding of QDs to DNA was
   explored using AFM. The DNA concentration was found to be a key factor
   influencing AFM imaging quality. In air and liquids, the optimal DNA
   concentration for imaging DNA molecules was approximately 2.5 and 0.25
   mu g/mL, and that for imaging DNA binding with QDs was 0.5 and 0.25 mu
   g/mL, respectively. In the presence of QDs, the DNA conformation was
   altered with the formation of DNA condensates. Finally, the fine
   conformation of QD-DNA binding sites was examined to analyze the binding
   mechanisms. This work will benefit investigations of NP-DNA interactions
   and the understanding of the structure of NP-DNA bioconjugates. See

Abstract = {{Historical and in-service pavement layer data along with pavement
   maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (MR\&R) history is
   critical information for developing a reliable and accurate pavement
   performance model that is indispensably necessary for the support of a
   pavement management system. The conventional homogeneous segmentation
   method for pavement layer data repository has the problem of excessive
   segmentation, which may result in inefficient data storage and
   incomplete data. To address this issue, a spatiotemporal block model is
   proposed to eliminate the need of homogeneous segmentation, and thus
   avoid the excessive segmentation and the creation of tiny pavement
   segments. Three time factors are defined for each pavement layer block
   to maintain the temporal information of a pavement layer structure. A
   depth-first-search (DFS)-based cluster searching algorithm is used for
   reconstruction and visualization of pavement structures as well as for
   data manipulation. A case study is presented to demonstrate the
   application developed using the proposed model and algorithms. The
   computing time and merits of the proposed methodology are also

Title = {{Evaluation of enantiopure and non-enantiopure Co(III)-salen catalysts

   of racemic epichlorohydrin}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A-CHEMICAL}},

Abstract = {{Hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) resolves racemic epoxides using
   water as the nucleophile and is most often catalyzed by chiral
   Co(III)-salens.(1) Previous studies have shown that the counter-ion of
   the Co(III)-salen has a direct effect on rate of HKR: when catalyzed by
   a 50:50 mix of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-OH and (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-SbF6, the
   fastest HKR rates occurred. It has further been shown that the
   enantioselectivity is primarily associated with the reaction of
   (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-OH on the activated epoxide. Based on the
   aforementioned origin of selectivity, a catalyst containing a 50:50 mix
   of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-OH and (+/-)-trans-Co(III)-salen-SbF6 could, in
   principle, give high activities and enantioselectivities for HKR
   comparable to a mixed counter-ion system containing both
   (R,R)-Co(III)-salens. Here, a series of experiments are described that
   demonstrate that highly selective catalysis is only achieved using 100\%
   enantiopure ligand, and mixtures of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen and
   (+/-)-trans-Co(III)-salen yield lower activity and selectivity. Control
   experiments demonstrate this is due to rapid counter-ion scrambling
   under reaction conditions, precluding the possibility of effectively
   co-utilizing enantiopure (expensive) and racemic (inexpensive) catalysts
   with differing counter-ions. The mechanistic investigations resolving
   the counter-ion scrambling are consistent with the currently accepted
   mechanism for catalysis, involving cooperative activity of two
   Co(III)-salen species that activate the epoxide and water in the
   reaction. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   known approaches, the unfrustrated lattices can be further locked in
   place allowing for the removal of the applied magnetic field and
   processing without disrupting the initial order with different

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{2221-2228}},
Abstract = {{Flame propagation of aluminum-ice (ALICE) mixtures is studied
   theoretically and experimentally. Both a mono distribution of nano
   aluminum particles and a bimodal distribution of nano-and micron-sized
   aluminum particles are considered over a pressure range of 1-10 MPa. A
   multi-zone theoretical framework is established to predict the burning
   rate and temperature distribution by solving the energy equation in each
   zone and matching the temperature and heat flux at the interfacial
   boundaries. The burning rates are measured experimentally by burning
   aluminum-ice strands in a constant-volume vessel. For stoichiometric
   ALICE mixtures with 80 nm particles, the burning rate shows a pressure
   dependence of r(b) = aP(n), with an exponent of 0.33. If a portion of 80
   nm particles is replaced with 5 and 20 mu m particles, the burning rate
   is not significantly affected for a loading density up to 15-25\% and
   decreases significantly beyond this value. The flame thickness of a
   bimodal-particle mixture is greater than its counterpart of a
   mono-dispersed particle mixture. The theoretical and experimental

Title = {{Seismic risk mitigation of building structures: The role of risk
   aversion}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{11-19}},
Abstract = {{Risk mitigation decisions for civil infrastructure exposed to rare
   natural and manmade hazards are often impacted by risk aversion, a
   behavioral phenomenon in which the decision maker's perception and
   judgment of risk are systematically distorted, resulting in decisions
   that might be viewed as excessively conservative when compared to those
   from a traditional minimum expected cost analysis. Risk aversion is
   believed to be especially significant if the decision maker is
   confronted with a low-probability event with catastrophic consequences.
   Most consequence-based decision models, including those based on minimum
   expected lifecycle cost, have supported engineering decisions in many
   contexts but address the influence of risk perception on those decisions
   only to a limited degree. This study is aimed at exploring how decisions
   regarding structural safety are affected by the attitudes of the
   decision-maker toward risk using decision models, such as cumulative
   prospect theory, that allow risk-averse behaviors to be modeled. The
   nature of risk aversion is highlighted through two examples, the first
   involving seismic retrofit and the second related to aseismic design of
   a frame. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex group of alkyl-substituted acyclic,
   monocyclic and polycyclic carboxylic acids present in crude oil, oil
   sands process water and tailings ponds, as well as in refinery
   wastewater. Bioassays were performed to investigate the
   biotransformation potential and inhibitory effect of a commercial NA
   mixture to nitrification, denitrification and
   fermentation/methanogenesis using mixed cultures not previously exposed
   to NAs. NAs inhibited nitrification in a mixed aerobic
   heterotrophic/nitrifying culture at concentrations as low as 80 mg NA/L,
   whereas, an enriched nitrifying culture was only affected at 400 mg
   NA/L. The lower nitrification inhibition in the latter assay is
   attributed to the higher population size of nitrosofying and nitrifying
   bacteria compared to the mixed heterotrophic/nitrifying culture. The NA
   mixture was not inhibitory to denitrifiers up to 400 mg/L. At higher NA
   concentrations, cell lysis was pronounced and lysis products were the
   main source of degradable carbon driving denitrification in culture
   series prepared without an external carbon source. In the presence of a
   degradable external carbon source, no difference was observed in nitrate
   reduction rates or nitrogen gas production at all NA concentrations
   tested. Methanogenesis was completely inhibited at NA concentrations
   equal to or higher than 200 mg/L. Methanogenic culture series amended
   with 80 mg NAIL were transiently inhibited and methane production in
   culture series prepared with NAs and an external carbon source or NAs
   only recovered in 136 and 41 days, respectively. Accumulation of
   volatile fatty acids was observed at inhibitory NA concentrations;
   however, carbon dioxide production was not affected by NAs, indicating
   that fermentation and acidogenesis were not affected by NAs. NAs were
   not degraded under nitrate-reducing or fermentative/methanogenic
   conditions used in the present study, regardless of the presence or not
   of another, degradable carbon/energy source. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex group of alkyl-substituted acyclic,
   monocyclic and polycyclic carboxylic acids present in oil sands process
   waters, crude oil, refinery wastewater and petroleum products. Crude
   oil, desalter brine, influent, activated sludge mixed liquor and
   effluent refinery samples were received from six United States
   refineries. The total acid number (TAN) of the six crudes tested ranged
   from 0.12 to 1.5 mg KOH/g crude oil and correlated to the total NA
   concentration in the crudes. The total NA concentration in the desalter
   brine, influent, activated sludge mixed liquor and effluent samples
   ranged from 4.2 to 40.4, 4.5 to 16.6, 9.6 to 140.3 and 2.8 to 11.6 mg
   NA/L, respectively. The NAs in all wastewater streams accounted for less
   than 16\% of the total COD, indicating that many other organic compounds
   are present and that NAs are a minor component in refinery wastewaters.
   Susceptibility tests showed that none of the activated sludge
   heterotrophic microcosms was completely inhibited by NAs up to 400 mg/L.
   Growth inhibition ranging from 10 to 59\% was observed in all microcosms
   at and above 100 mg NA/L. NAs chronically-sorbed to activated sludge
   mixed liquor biomass and powdered activated carbon (PAC) were
   recalcitrant and persistent. More than 80\% of the total NAs remained in
   the solid phase at the end of the 10-day desorption period (five
   successive desorption steps). Throughout a 90-day incubation period, the
   total NA concentration decreased by 33 and 51\% in PAC-free and
   PAC-containing mixed liquor microcosms, respectively. The lower
   molecular weight fraction of NAs was preferentially degraded in both
   mixed liquors. The persistence of the residual, higher molecular weight
   NAs is likely a combination of molecular recalcitrance and decreased
   bioavailability when chronically-sorbed to the biomass and/or PAC. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work, the site saturation mutagenesis of tyrosine 195, tyrosine
   260 and glutamine 265 in the cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase)
   from Paenibacillus macerans was conducted to improve the specificity of
   CGTase for maltodextrin, which can be used as a cheap and easily soluble
   glycosyl donor for the synthesis of 2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid
   (AA-2G). Specifically, the site-saturation mutagenesis of three
   sites-tyrosine 195, tyrosine 260, and glutamine 265-was performed, and
   it was found that the resulting mutants (containing the mutations Y195S
   {[}tyrosine -> serine], Y260R {[}tyrosine -> arginine], and Q265K
   {[}glutamine -> lysine]) produced higher AA-2G yields than the wild type
   and the other mutant CGTases when maltodextrin was used as the glycosyl
   donor. Furthermore, double and triple mutations were introduced, and
   four mutants (containing Y195S/Y260R, Y195S/Q265K, Y260R/Q265K, and
   Y260R/Q265K/Y195S) were obtained and evaluated for the capacity to
   produce AA2G. The Y260R/Q265K/Y195S triple mutant produced the highest
   titer of AA-2G at 1.92 g/liter, which was 60\% higher than that (1.20
   g/liter) produced by the wild-type CGTase. The kinetics analysis of
   AA-2G synthesis by the mutant CGTases confirmed the enhanced
   maltodextrin specificity, and it was also found that compared with the
   wild-type CGTase, all seven mutants had lower cyclization activities and
   higher hydrolysis and disproportionation activities. Finally, the
   mechanism responsible for the enhanced substrate specificity was
   explored by structure modeling, which indicated that the enhancement of
   maltodextrin specificity may be related to the changes of hydrogen
   bonding interactions between the side chain of residue at the three
   positions (195, 260, and 265) and the substrate sugars. This work adds
   to our understanding of the synthesis of AA-2G and makes the
   Y260R/Q265K/Y195S mutant a good starting point for further development
   by protein engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The field electron emission of carbon nanotubes has been heavily studied
   over the past two decades for various applications, such as in display
   technologies, microwave amplifiers, and spacecraft propulsion. However,
   a commercializable lightweight and internally gated electron source has
   yet to be realized. This work presents the fabrication and testing of a
   novel internally gated carbon nanotube field electron emitter. Several
   specific methods are used to prevent electrical shorting of the gate
   layer, a common failure for internally gated devices. A unique design is
   explored where the etch pits extend into the silicon substrate and
   isotropic etching is used to create a lateral buffer zone between the
   gate and carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are self-aligned to and
   within 10 microns from the gate, which creates large electric fields at
   low potential inputs. Initial tests confirm high field emission
   performance with an anode current density (based on total area of the
   device) of 293 mu A cm(-2) and a gate current density of 1.68 mA cm(-2)

Abstract = {{Frameshift (FS) prediction is important for analysis and biological
   interpretation of metagenomic sequences. Since a genomic context of a
   short metagenomic sequence is rarely known, there is not enough data
   available to estimate parameters of species-specific statistical models
   of protein-coding and non-coding regions. The challenge of ab initio FS
   detection is, therefore, two fold: (i) to find a way to infer necessary
   model parameters and (ii) to identify positions of frameshifts (if any).
   Here we describe a new tool, MetaGeneTack, which uses a heuristic method
   to estimate parameters of sequence models used in the FS detection
   algorithm. It is shown on multiple test sets that the MetaGeneTack FS
   detection performance is comparable or better than the one of earlier
   developed program FragGeneScan.}},

   these systems to dynamically adjust their actuating, sensing, and
   networking capabilities based on physical constraints, such as power
   levels. Furthermore, it allows for sensing and control algorithms to
   migrate to different platforms, which gives multi-agent control
   application designers the ability to adjust sensing and control as the
   network evolves. This paper describes the design and implementation of
   our software system and demonstrates its successful application on
   robots and sensor nodes, which dynamically modify their operational

Abstract = {{We consider a two-station tandem queue loss model where customers arrive
   to station 1 according to a Poisson process. A gatekeeper who has
   complete knowledge of the number of customers at both stations decides
   to accept or reject each arrival. A cost c(1) is incurred if a customer
   is rejected, while if an admitted customer finds that station 2 is full
   at the time of his service completion at station 1, he leaves the system
   and a cost c(2) is incurred. Assuming exponential service times at both
   stations, an arbitrary but finite buffer size at station 1 and a buffer
   size of one at station 2, we show that the optimal admission control
   policy for minimizing the long-run average cost per unit time has a
   simple structure. Depending on the value of c(2) compared to a threshold
   value c({*}), it is optimal to admit a customer at the time of his
   arrival either only if the system is empty or as long as there is space
   at station 1. We also provide the closed-form expression of c({*}),
   which depends on the service rates at both stations, the arrival rate
   and c(1).}},

Abstract = {{Dimensional integrity has a significant impact on the quality of the
   final products in multistation assembly processes. A large body of
   research work in fault diagnosis has been proposed to identify the root
   causes of the large dimensional variations on products. These methods
   are based on a linear relationship between the dimensional measurements
   of the products and the possible process errors, and assume that the
   number of measurements is greater than that of process errors. However,
   in practice, the number of measurements is often less than that of
   process errors due to economical considerations. This brings a
   substantial challenge to the fault diagnosis in multistation assembly
   processes since the problem becomes solving an underdetermined system.
   In order to tackle this challenge, a fault diagnosis methodology is
   proposed by integrating the state space model with the enhanced
   relevance vector machine (RVM) to identify the process faults through
   the sparse estimate of the variance change of the process errors. The
   results of case studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology can
   identify process faults successfully.}},

Abstract = {{Computer models are widely used to simulate real processes. Within the
   computer model, there always exist some parameters which are
   unobservable in the real process but need to be specified in the model.
   The procedure to adjust these unknown parameters in order to fit the
   model to observed data and improve predictive capability is known as
   calibration. Practically, calibration is typically done manually. In
   this paper, we propose an effective and efficient algorithm based on the
   stochastic approximation (SA) approach that can be easily automated. We
   first demonstrate the feasibility of applying stochastic approximation
   to stochastic computer model calibration and apply it to three
   stochastic simulation models. We compare our proposed SA approach with
   another direct calibration search method, the genetic algorithm. The
   results indicate that our proposed SA approach performs equally as well
   in terms of accuracy and significantly better in terms of computational
   search time. We further consider the calibration parameter uncertainty
   in the subsequent application of the calibrated model and propose an
   approach to quantify it using asymptotic approximations.}},

Abstract = {{Single sensor digital cameras use color filter arrays to capture a
   subset of the color data at each pixel coordinate. Demosaicing or color
   filter array (CFA) interpolation is the process of estimating the
   missing color samples to reconstruct a full color image. In this paper,
   we propose a demosaicing method that uses multiscale color gradients to
   adaptively combine color difference estimates from different directions.
   The proposed solution does not require any thresholds since it does not
   make any hard decisions, and it is noniterative. Although most suitable
   for the Bayer CFA pattern, the method can be extended to other mosaic
   patterns. To demonstrate this, we describe its application to the Lukac
   CFA pattern. Experimental results show that it outperforms other
   available demosaicing methods by a clear margin in terms of CPSNR and
   S-CIELAB measures for both mosaic patterns.}},

Abstract = {{As scaling DRAM cells becomes more challenging and energy-efficient DRAM
   chips are in high demand, the DRAM industry has started to undertake an
   alternative approach to address these looming issues-that is, to
   vertically stack DRAM dies with through-silicon-vias (TSVs) using 3-D-IC
   technology. Furthermore, this emerging integration technology also makes
   heterogeneous die stacking in one DRAM package possible. Such a
   heterogeneous DRAM chip provides a unique, promising opportunity for
   computer architects to contemplate a new memory hierarchy for future
   system design. In this paper, we study how to design such a
   heterogeneous DRAM chip for improving both performance and energy
   efficiency. In particular, we found that, if we want to design an SRAM
   row cache in a DRAM chip, simple stacking alone cannot address the
   majority of traditional SRAM row cache design issues. In this paper, to
   address these issues, we propose a novel floorplan and several
   architectural techniques that fully exploit the benefits of 3-D stacking
   technology. Our multi-core simulation results with memory-intensive
   applications suggest that, by tightly integrating a small row cache with
   its corresponding DRAM array, we can improve performance by 30\% while
   saving dynamic energy by 31\%.}},

Abstract = {{A new physical parameter is presented and it is applied to damage
   detection to address the two main challenges in the field of
   vibration-based structural health monitoring: the sensitivity of
   detection and the requirement of data of the baseline state. The
   parameter is also shown to be not affected by noise in the detection
   ambience. Assuming the damaged structure to be a linear system, its
   response can be expressed as the summation of the responses due to the
   undamaged and the damaged part. If the part of the response due to the
   damage is isolated, it forms what can be regarded as the damage
   signature. In this paper, the occurrence of damage signature is
   investigated when the damaged structure is excited at one of its natural
   frequencies, and it is called partial-mode contribution. The existence
   of damage signature as partial-mode contribution is first verified using
   an analytical derivation. Thereupon, its existence is ascertained using
   finite element models and by doing experiments. The limits of size of
   the damage that can be determined using the method are also
   investigated. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007080]}},

Abstract = {{An error is introduced by the conventional approach of applying beam
   theory in the presence of interiorly applied loads. This error arises
   from neglecting the influence of the precise distribution of surface
   tractions and body forces on the warping displacements. This paper
   intends to show that beam theory is capable of accounting for this
   influence on warping and accomplishes this by the variational asymptotic
   method. Correlations between elasticity solutions and beam solutions
   provide not only validations of beam solutions, but also illustrate the
   resulting errors from the conventional approach. Correlations are

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation supervision has emerged as a new application of wireless
   sensor networks (WSN), with unique communication, signal processing and
   hardware design requirements. It is a broad and complex
   interdisciplinary research area on which more than one hundred papers
   have been published by several research communities (electronics,
   bio-mechanical, control and computer science). In this paper, we present
   WSN for rehabilitation supervision with a focus on key scientific and
   technical challenges that have been solved as well as interdisciplinary
   challenges that are still open. We thoroughly review existing projects
   conducted by several research communities involved in this exciting
   field. Furthermore, we discuss the open research issues and give
   directions for future research works. Our aim is to gather information
   that encourage engineers, clinicians and computer scientists to work
   together in this field to tackle the arising challenges. We believe that
   bridging researchers with different scientific backgrounds could have a
   significant impact on the development of WSN for rehabilitation and
   could improve the way rehabilitation is provided today. (C) 2012

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there have been rapid advances in network
   infrastructure and technologies for end-user communication. However,
   because of network dynamics and resource limitation, providing scalable
   end-user communication services is challenging when the applications are
   utilized on a large-scale. To address this challenge, a replica-aided
   load balancing scheme (RALB) is proposed for enabling the nodes in an
   overlay networks to support the communication applications for a large
   number of users. This paper makes three unique contributions. First, we
   study the existing load balancing schemes and identify their weakness in
   handling time-varying workloads with frequent load fluctuations. Second,
   we introduce a sophisticated cost model for load balancing cost
   estimation, which captures the dependencies between the factors (e.g.,
   the load, message number, and link latency). Third, we propose a
   performance tuning technique to minimize the load balancing cost. The
   extensive experiments show that RALB effectively reduces the load
   imbalance and eliminates the load balancing cost when compared to the
   existing load balancing schemes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The dielectric relaxation properties of poly( methylmethacrylate)
   (PMMA), polystyrene-block-poly (methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) diblock
   copolymers and PS/PMMA blends were investigated by broadband dielectric
   spectroscopy in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz and
   temperature range from -40 to 150 degrees C. By parametric fitting
   techniques, an alpha relaxation process associated with the glass
   transition, the secondary beta relaxation process due to localized
   motions of side groups, and the conductivity at low frequencies were
   identified and modeled for all samples. Based on the modeling results,
   the characteristic relaxation time, fragility index, activation
   energies, and relaxation strength of PMMA and PS-b-PMMA diblock
   copolymers were compared. It was found that the structural alpha
   relaxation of the copolymers was suppressed compared with that of PMMA.
   The covalent chemical bonds that link PS and PMMA blocks in the diblock
   copolymers are therefore assumed to dominate over the PMMA-PMMA, PMMA-PS
   and PS-PS bonds that exist in the PMMA and PS/PMMA samples, accounting
   for the suppression of the cooperative structural alpha relaxation and
   for larger activation energies of the localized beta relaxation of the
   diblock copolymers. Further, the activation energy barriers of localized
   beta relaxations in the copolymers are observed to increase, above the
   glass transition temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the continuous theory of defects in nonlinear elastic solids, it is
   known that a distribution of disclinations leads, in general, to a
   non-trivial residual stress field. To study this problem, we consider
   the particular case of determining the residual stress field of a
   cylindrically symmetric distribution of parallel wedge disclinations. We
   first use the tools of differential geometry to construct a Riemannian
   material manifold in which the body is stress-free. This manifold is
   metric compatible, has zero torsion, but has non-vanishing curvature.
   The problem then reduces to embedding this manifold in Euclidean 3-space
   following the procedure of a classical nonlinear elastic problem. We
   show that this embedding can be elegantly accomplished by using Cartan's
   method of moving frames and compute explicitly the residual stress field
   for various distributions in the case of a neo-Hookean material.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful fingerprint
   vibrational spectroscopy with a single-molecule detection limit, but its
   applications are generally restricted to `free-electron-like' metal
   substrates such as Au, Ag and Cu nanostructures. We have invented a
   shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS)
   technique, using Au-core silica-shell nanoparticles (Au@SiO2 NPs), which
   makes SERS universally applicable to surfaces with any composition and
   any morphology. This protocol describes how to prepare shell-isolated
   nanoparticles (SHINs) with different well-controlled core sizes (55 and
   120 nm), shapes (nanospheres, nanorods and nanocubes) and shell
   thicknesses (1-20 nm). It then describes how to apply SHINs to Pt and Au
   single-crystal surfaces with different facets in an electrochemical
   environment, on Si wafer surfaces adsorbed with hydrogen, on ZnO
   nanorods, and on living bacteria and fruit. With this method, SHINs can
   be prepared for use in similar to 3 h, and each subsequent procedure for
   SHINERS measurement requires 1-2 h.}},

Abstract = {{Database annotations of prokaryotic genomes and eukaryotic mRNA
   sequences pay relatively low attention to frame transitions that disrupt
   protein-coding genes. Frame transitions (frameshifts) could be caused by
   sequencing errors or indel mutations inside protein-coding regions.
   Other observed frameshifts are related to recoding events (that evolved
   to control expression of some genes). Earlier, we have developed an
   algorithm and software program GeneTack for ab initio frameshift finding
   in intronless genes. Here, we describe a database (freely available at
   http://topaz.gatech.edu/GeneTack/db.html) containing genes with
   frameshifts (fs-genes) predicted by GeneTack. The database includes 206
   991 fs-genes from 1106 complete prokaryotic genomes and 45 295
   frameshifts predicted in mRNA sequences from 100 eukaryotic genomes. The
   whole set of fs-genes was grouped into clusters based on sequence
   similarity between fs-proteins (conceptually translated fs-genes),
   conservation of the frameshift position and frameshift direction (-1,
   +1). The fs-genes can be retrieved by similarity search to a given query
   sequence via a web interface, by fs-gene cluster browsing, etc. Clusters
   of fs-genes are characterized with respect to their likely origin, such
   as pseudogenization, phase variation, etc. The largest clusters contain
   fs-genes with programed frameshifts (related to recoding events).}},

Abstract = {{The stabilization, translation and degradation of RNA are regulated by
   interactions between trans-acting factors, such as microRNA and
   RNA-binding proteins (RBP). In order to investigate the relationships

   tetravalent RNA imaging probes (MTRIPs), targeted to sequences near RBP
   binding sites, with proximity ligation and rolling circle amplification
   (RCA). Using this method, we detected and quantified, with
   single-interaction sensitivity, the localization and frequency of
   interactions of the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV)
   nucleocapsid protein (N) with viral genomic RNA (gRNA). We also

Title = {{Response of non-premixed flames to bulk flow perturbations}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{963-971}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the dynamics of non-premixed flames responding to
   bulk velocity fluctuations, and compares the dynamics of the flame sheet
   position and spatially integrated heat release to that of a premixed
   flame. The space-time dynamics of the non-premixed flame sheet in the
   fast chemistry limit is described by the stoichiometric mixture fraction
   surface, extracted from the solution of the Z-equation. This procedure
   has some analogies to premixed flames, where the premixed flame sheet
   location is extracted from the G = 0 surface of the solution of the
   G-equation. A key difference between the premixed and non-premixed flame
   dynamics, however, is the fact that the non-premixed flame sheet
   dynamics are a function of the disturbance field everywhere, and not
   just at the reaction sheet, as in the premixed flame problem. A second
   key difference is that the non-premixed flame does not propagate and so
   flame wrinkles are convected downstream at the axial flow velocity,
   while wrinkles in premixed flames convect downstream at a vector sum of
   the flame speed and axial velocity. With the exception of the flame
   wrinkle propagation speed, however, we show that that the solutions for
   the space-time dynamics of the premixed and non-premixed reaction sheets
   in high velocity axial flows are quite similar. In contrast, there are
   important differences in their spatially integrated unsteady heat
   release dynamics. Premixed flame heat release fluctuations are dominated
   by area fluctuations, while non-premixed flames are dominated by mass
   burning rate fluctuations. At low Strouhal numbers, the resultant
   sensitivity of both flames to flow disturbances is the same, but the
   non-premixed flame response rolls off slower with frequency. Hence, this
   analysis suggests that non-premixed flames are more sensitive to flow
   perturbations than premixed flames at O(1) Strouhal numbers. (C) 2012

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1527-1535}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes measurements and correlations of turbulent
   consumption speeds, S-T,S-GC, of hydrogen/carbon monoxide (H-2/CO) fuel
   mixtures over a range of conditions. This work is set within the broader
   context of understanding the sensitivity of the turbulent flame speed to
   chemical kinetic and diffusive properties of the reactive mixture.
   Turbulent consumption speed data were obtained at mean flow velocities,
   turbulence intensities (u'(rms)/S-L,S-0), equivalence ratios and
   pressures ranging from 4-50 m/s, 5-45, 0.5-0.8, and 1-10 atm,
   respectively. Experiments were conducted where the mixture equivalence
   ratio, phi, was adjusted at each fuel composition to have nominally the
   same calculated un-stretched laminar flame speed, S-L,S-0. Consistent
   with prior studies, these data show both fuel composition and pressure
   effects on the turbulent flame speed. For example, measured S-T,S-GC
   values of the 90/10 H-2/CO are about 3 times larger than CH4 blends
   having the same S-L,S-0, turbulence intensity, and operating conditions.
   Similarly, the 5 atm data have S-T,S-GC values that are consistently
   about 1.8 times larger than the 1 atm data, at identical conditions and
   fuel compositions. These data are correlated with a scaling law derived
   from quasi-steady leading points concepts using detailed kinetics
   calculations of highly stretched flames. For a given pressure, these
   scalings do an excellent job in scaling data obtained across the H-2/CO
   fuel composition and equivalence ratio range. However, the pressure
   sensitivities are not captured by this scaling, which may be more
   fundamentally a reflection of the non-quasi-steady nature of the flame
   leading points. In support of this argument, we show that the spread in
   the data can largely be correlated with the ratio of a leading point
   chemical time scale to a flow time scale. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Abstract = {{We present electroelastic modeling, analytical and numerical solutions,
   and experimental validations of piezoelectric energy harvesting from
   broadband random vibrations. The modeling approach employed herein is
   based on a distributed-parameter electroelastic formulation to ensure
   that the effects of higher vibration modes are included, since broadband
   random vibrations, such as Gaussian white noise, might excite higher
   vibration modes. The goal is to predict the expected value of the power
   output and the mean-square shunted vibration response in terms of the
   given power spectral density (PSD) or time history of the random
   vibrational input. The analytical method is based on the PSD of random
   base excitation and distributed-parameter frequency response functions
   of the coupled voltage output and shunted vibration response. The first
   of the two numerical solution methods employs the Fourier series
   representation of the base acceleration history in an ordinary
   differential equation solver while the second method uses an
   Euler-Maruyama scheme to directly solve the resulting electroelastic
   stochastic differential equations. The analytical and numerical
   simulations are compared with several experiments for a brass-reinforced
   PZT-5H bimorph under different random excitation levels. The simulations
   exhibit very good agreement with the experimental measurements for a
   range of resistive electrical boundary conditions and input PSD levels.
   It is also shown that lightly damped higher vibration modes can alter
   the expected power curve under broadband random excitation. Therefore,
   the distributed-parameter modeling and solutions presented herein can be
   used as a more accurate alternative to the existing
   single-degree-of-freedom solutions for broadband random vibration energy
   harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Increased tissue stiffness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions
   (EMTs) are two seemingly discrete hallmarks of fibrotic diseases.
   Despite recent findings highlighting the influence of tissue mechanical
   properties on cell phenotype, it remains unclear what role increased
   tissue stiffness has in the regulation of previously reported
   fibronectin-mediated EMTs associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
   Nano-indentation testing of lung interstitial spaces showed that in vivo
   cell-level Young's moduli increase with the onset of fibrosis from
   similar to 2 to similar to 17 kPa. In vitro, we found that stiff, but
   not soft, fibronectin substrates induce EMT, a response dependent on
   cell contraction-mediated integrin activation of TGF beta. Activation or
   suppression of cell contractility with exogenous factors was sufficient
   to overcome the effect of substrate stiffness. Pulse-chase experiments
   indicate that the effect of cell contractility is dose-and
   time-dependent. In response to low levels of TGF beta on soft surfaces,
   either added exogenously or produced through thrombin-induced
   contraction, cells will initiate the EMT programme, but upon removal
   revert to an epithelial phenotype. These results identify matrix
   stiffness and/or cell contractility as critical targets for novel
   therapeutics for fibrotic diseases. Copyright (C) 2012 Pathological

Abstract = {{Knowledge of workforce productivity and activity is crucial for
   determining whether a construction project can be accomplished on time
   and within budget. Significant work has been done on improving and
   assessing productivity and activity at task, project, or industry
   levels. Task level productivity and activity analysis are used
   extensively within the construction industry for various purposes,
   including cost estimating, claim evaluation, and day-to-day project
   management. The assessment is mostly performed through visual
   observations and after-the-fact analyses even though previous studies
   show automatic translation of operations data into productivity
   information and provide spatial information of resources for specific
   construction operations. An original approach is presented that
   automatically assesses labor activity. Using data fusion of
   spatio-temporal and workers' thoracic posture data, a framework was
   developed for identifying and understanding the worker's activity type
   over time. This information is used to perform automatic work sampling
   that is expected to facilitate real-time productivity assessment.

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{107-122}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A literature review revealed several major shortcomings in the analysis
   of construction equipment operations data, for example, the lack of
   using realistic or real-time positioning data that can feed into an
   equipment operations analysis or simulation model. This paper presents
   technology and algorithms that have the potential in aiding the
   automated assessment of construction site equipment operations.
   Utilizing commercially available low-cost global positioning system
   (GPS) devices enables the continuous data logging of equipment location
   in addition to simultaneously recording timestamps. However, before any
   such spatio-temporal equipment data can be reliably collected on
   construction sites, the error rate of the GPS devices had to be
   evaluated. Data analysis methods and rules for monitoring construction
   site equipment operations and activity were then defined. A detailed
   software interface was finally created that allows a user to set,
   analyze, and visualize several important equipment parameters towards
   achieving the goal of creating more realistic equipment operation
   analysis and potential for inclusion in simulation models. Results from
   field experiments show that the developed technology is able to identify
   and track equipment activity- and safety-related information
   automatically for job site performance and layout decision making,
   respectively. The presented work will aid construction project managers
   in making better decisions to plan, manage, and control
   equipment-related work tasks on construction sites. Published by

Abstract = {{Construction safety is a national and worldwide issue. This paper
   contributes in solving this problem by applying automated safety rule
   checking to Building Information Models (BIM). Algorithms that
   automatically analyze a building model to detect safety hazards and

   involving fall related hazards. As BIM is changing the way construction
   can be approached, the presented work and case studies extend BIM to
   include automated hazard identification and correction during
   construction planning and in certain cases, during design. A rule-based
   engine that utilizes this framework is implemented on top of a
   commercially available BIM platform to show the feasibility of the
   approach. As a result, the developed automated safety checking platform
   informs construction engineers and managers by reporting, why, where,
   when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related
   accidents before construction starts. The safety area reviewed is fall
   protection. An example case study of such a system is also provided.

Abstract = {{The energy harvesting efficiency is of tremendous importance for the
   realization of a high output-power nanogenerator serving as the basis
   for self-powered electronics. Here we report that the device performance
   of a sound-driven piezoelectric energy nanogenerator (SPENG) is
   remarkably improved by controlling both the carrier density and the
   interfacial energy in a semiconducting ZnO nanowire (NW), thereby
   achieving its intrinsic efficiency limits. A SPENG with
   carrier-controlled ZnO NWs exhibits excellent energy harvesting
   characteristics with an average power density of 0.9 mW cm(-3), as well
   as a near 50 fold increase in both output voltage and current compared
   to those of a conventional ZnO NW. In addition, we demonstrate for the
   first time that an optimized SPENG is large enough and very suitable to
   drive electrophoretic ink displays based on voltage-drive systems. This
   fundamental progress makes it possible to fabricate high performance
   nanogenerators for viable industrial applications in portable/wearable
   personal electronics such as electronic papers and smart identity cards.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient purification of hydrogen from high temperature mixed gas

   in the large-scale production of hydrogen from gasification of coal or

   statistical methods to systematically predict hydrogen permeability
   through amorphous ternary Zr-Cu-T films (T = 17 elements) and other
   selected amorphous materials. These results greatly expand the range of
   amorphous materials that have been considered as hydrogen purification
   membranes. More importantly, we demonstrate that relatively simple
   descriptions of the site binding energies in these amorphous materials
   can account for the key observations from our detailed first-principles
   calculations. This outcome significantly reduces the computational
   effort required in future screening of materials in this application and
   also places bounds on the ultimate performance of these materials.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to evaluate the effective modulus of carbon
   nanotube (CNT) reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites based on

   built and subjected to tensile loading. The thickness and stiffness of
   CNT/PP interphase, dispersion and distribution of CNTs within the PP
   matrix, their alignment with respect to the applied load and their
   waviness are characterized using atomic force microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy of the CNT/PP composites made by melt mixing and
   injection molding. The modulus predicted numerically is in good
   agreement with that obtained experimentally, according to ASTM D638. The
   proposed elaborated numerical model can provide the lower and upper

Abstract = {{The hydrogenation of biomass pyrolysis oils to upgraded biofuels,
   especially the aliphatic compounds with a low boiling range has
   attracted significant research attention. However, compared with the
   water soluble phase of pyrolysis oils, the water insoluble parts are
   relatively difficult to upgrade due to the complex high molecular weight
   aromatic structures. To solve this problem, a two step hydrogenation of
   water insoluble pyrolysis oil (heavy oil) produced from pyrolysis of
   pine wood ethanol organosolv lignin (EOL) at 600 degrees C for 30 min
   was examined. Ru/C was used as the catalyst and water was used as the
   dispersant for the heavy oil and hydrogenation products. The carbon
   conversion yields for the first and second step hydrogenation are 35\%
   and 33\% (overall molar\% of carbon content in the heavy oil),
   respectively. The products of first step of hydrogenation are primarily
   aromatic molecules which are produced from the hydrolytic cleavage of
   ether bond and methoxy groups in the heavy oils. Further hydrogenation
   was shown to covert the insoluble heavy oils (weight average molecular
   weight is 265 g/mol) to the aliphatic alcohols and other aliphatic
   components which could be used as renewable gasoline. As far as we know,
   this is the first reported effort to upgrade water insoluble parts of
   lignin pyrolysis oil to the total aliphatic components by aqueous phase
   hydrogenation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{A seeded growth method is reported for synthesis of MCM-48 membranes on
   alpha-alumina supports, thereby extending the seeded growth technique
   used for zeolite membranes to mesoporous silica membrane synthesis. The
   surface properties of the MCM-48 membranes are then modified by
   silylation with hexamethyldisilazane. The physicochemical properties of
   these membranes are characterized by multiple techniques. X-ray
   diffraction demonstrates that the structure of the MCM-48 membranes is
   maintained after surfactant removal and silylation. In comparison to
   MCM-48 membranes previously synthesized by the in situ growth technique,
   much less silica infiltration into the alumina support is observed by
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The pore structure of the MCM-48
   membranes is assessed by direct nitrogen physisorption measurements on
   membrane samples, demonstrating that a large accessible pore volume is
   available for molecular permeation and pore modification to tailor
   selectivity. The gas permeation properties of the calcined and silylated
   MCM-48 membranes are consistent with a Knudsen-like mechanism, albeit
   with a substantial influence of gas-solid interactions in the mesopores.
   The silylated MCM-48 membranes are evaluated for pervaporative
   separation of ethanol (EtOH), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and ethyl
   acetate (EA) from their dilute aqueous solutions (5 wt\%). The membranes
   showed pervaporative separation factors in the range of 5-35 and organic
   fluxes in the range of 0.03-0.22 kg-m(-2)h(-1) at 303 K. The intrinsic
   selectivities (water/organic permeability ratios) of the silylated
   membranes are 6 (water/EtOH), 10 (water/MEK), and 26 (water/EA)
   respectively, in comparison to selectivities of 66, 450, and 3900 for
   the unmodified membranes, at 303 K. The selective separation of
   organic/water mixtures with MCM-48 membranes is attributed to both the
   organophilic nature of the surface and the effective pore size of the
   silylated mesopores. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon molecular sieves (CMS) can be formed into higher performance
   membranes for gas separation with high selectivities without sacrificing
   productivity by tuning the pyrolysis temperature and atmosphere. The
   presence of trace amount of oxygen in pyrolysis atmospheres allows
   tuning of the separation performance of CMS membranes. Despite these
   advantages, current CMS membranes would benefit from simultaneous higher
   productivities and selectivities. The present report introduces a new
   aspect to the oxygen doping method, where higher temperature and a trace
   amount of oxygen are used (with balanced argon) in a secondary step
   after pyrolysis (Dual Temperature Secondary Oxygen Doping, DTSOD) for
   enhancing the separation performance of CMS membranes for the O-2/N-2
   gas pair while maintaining the high membrane permeance. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Laughter is an important para-linguistic cue that can be useful in
   gauging the affective state of the speaker. In this paper, we present an
   approach to detecting laughter in children's speech using acoustic
   features in the spectral and prosodic domains. Feature selection was
   performed using the information gain-based technique and a
   speaker-independent validation using a support vector machine (SVM), an
   accuracy of 94.43\% was observed, which was a 12.48\% absolute
   improvement over the baseline result of 81.95\%. For us to explore
   generalization properties, the models of speech and laughter were tested
   on a completely different database of adult-child interactions known as
   the Multimodal Dyadic Behavior Dataset (MDBD). The accuracy using the
   earlier trained models was 70.58\%. Even though the children in this
   database were toddlers (less than three years old), the results suggest
   that the predictive power of the selected features generalizes well to
   different forms of children's laughter.}},

Abstract = {{An HMM/DNN framework is proposed to address the issues of short-word
   detection. The first-stage keyword hypothesizer is redesigned with a
   context-aware keyword model and a 9 state filler model to reduce the
   miss rate from 80\% to 6\% and increase the figure-of-merit (FOM) from
   6.08\% to 21.88\% for short words. The hypothesizer is followed by a
   MLP-based second-stage keyword verifier to further reduce its putative
   hits. To enhance short word detection, three new techniques, including
   an HMM-based feature transfonnation for the MLPs, knowledge-based
   features, and deep neural networks, are incorporated into redesigning
   the verifier. With a set of nine short keywords from the TIMIT set the
   best FOM we had achieved for the proposed KWS system was 42.79\%, which
   is comparable with that of 42.6\% for long content words and much better
   than the FOM of 18.4\% for short keywords reported in previous research

   incorporated. For manner of articulation, six attribute detectors
   trained with an American English corpus (WSJO) are utilized to rescore
   hypothesized phones in word lattices obtained by a baseline ASR system.
   For the prosodic structure, models trained with an unsupervised joint
   prosody labeling and modeling (PLM) technique using WSJO are used in
   lattice rescoring. Experimental results on the American English WSJ word
   recognition task of the Nov92 test set show that the proposed approach
   significantly outperforms the baseline system that does not use
   articulatory and prosodic information. The results also demonstrate the
   effectiveness and usefulness of the PLM technique in constructing
   prosodic models for American English ASR.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical framework is proposed to address the issues of modeling
   different type of words in keyword spotting (KWS). Keyword models are
   built at various levels according to the availability of training set
   resources for each individual word. The proposed approach improves the
   performance of KWS even when no training speech is available for the
   keywords. It also suggests an easier way to collect training data for
   these resource-limited words. Experimental results show that the
   proposed framework improves performance in KWS in a figure-of-merit
   (FOM) metric regardless of the number of training instances for each
   keyword. For words with abundant speech data, the proposed method
   exploits the training data better than the conventional modeling
   technique and boosts the system FOM from 9.79\% to 42.78\%. For words
   with a small amount of training data, the new method increases the
   system FOM from 29.05\% to 49.06\%. Even for keywords without any
   training examples, the new modeling scheme improves the system FOM from
   60.96\% to 66.51\%.}},

Abstract = {{Speech can potentially be used to identify individuals from a distance

   distances for the enrollment and verification speech samples can
   potentially introduce new challenges for speaker recognition systems.
   This paper describes a data collection, referred to as the Standoff
   Multi-Microphone Speech Corpus, which allows investigation of the impact
   of recording distance mismatch on the performance of speaker recognition
   systems. Additionally, a supervised method for linear subspace
   decomposition was evaluated in an effort to mitigate the effects of
   recording distance mismatch. The results of this study indicate that
   mismatched recording distances have a consistent negative impact on
   performance of a standoff speaker recognition system; however, subspace
   decomposition techniques may be able to reduce the penalty observed with
   mismatched recording distances.}},

   lesson based on the student's learning style, musical background, or
   preference and quantitative assessment of the student's performance
   (whether as an online-instructor or self-taught through online videos).
   In particular, we discuss two solutions with specific applications.
   First, we propose a method for automating music lessons for learning how
   to play pre-recorded songs via existing music information retrieval
   (MIR) techniques for adaptability to various learning styles. Secondly,
   we propose a method for automating the assessment of rhythmic structures
   (such as tremolo, vibrato, etc.) via quantitative metrics of comparing
   modulation spectral features. We then list some resources and software
   that are currently available to integrate these methods to enhance

Abstract = {{The need to quantify aleatory and epistemic uncertainties has been
   widely recognized in the engineering applications. Aleatory uncertainty
   arises from inherent randomness, whereas epistemic uncertainty is due to
   the lack of knowledge. Traditionally uncertainty has been quantified by
   probability measures and the two uncertainty components are not readily
   differentiated. Intervals naturally capture the systematic error during
   data acquisition. We develop a new feature extraction and
   backpropagation neural network in the context of generalized interval
   theory, where all parameters are in the form of a generalized interval.
   Calculation of generalized interval based on the Kaucher arithmetic is
   greatly simplified in this application. To demonstrate the new
   framework, this paper provides a case study of recognizing the cutting
   states in the manufacturing process. The stable, transition, and chatter
   state states are recognized by the generalized backpropagation neural
   network (GBPNN) model. The results show that the proposed method has a
   good recognition performance.}},

   discuss the overall system approach and the forms of multi-modal verbal
   and nonverbal (i.e. gestural) cues used by the robotic agent. Results
   derived from 20 children, age 13 through 18, engaging with the robot
   during a tablet-based algebra exam show that, while various forms of

Abstract = {{Three dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) have emerged as a
   promising solution to continue device scaling. They can be realized
   using Through Silicon Vias (TSVs), or monolithic integration using
   Monolithic Inter-tier vias (MIVs), an emerging alternative that provides
   much higher via densities. In this paper, we provide a framework for
   floorplanning existing 2D IP blocks into 3D-ICs using MIVs. We take the
   floorplanning solution all the way through place-and-route and report
   post-layout metrics for area, wirelength, timing, and power consumption.
   Results show that the wirelength of TSV-based 3D designs outperform 2D
   designs by upto 14\% in large-scale circuits only. MIV-based 3D designs,
   however, offer an average wirelength improvement of 33\% for a wide
   range of benchmark circuits. We also show that while TSV-based 3D cannot
   improve the performance and power unless the TSV capacitance is reduced,
   MIV-based 3D offers significant reduction of upto 33\% in the longest
   path delay and 35\% in the inter-block net power.}},

Abstract = {{In 3D ICs, block-level designs provide various advantages over designs
   done at other granularity such as gate-level because they promote the
   reuse of IP blocks. In this paper, we study block-level 3D-IC designs,
   where the footprint of the dies in the stack are different. This happens
   in case of die-to-wafer bonding, which is more popular choice for
   near-term low-cost 3D designs. We study design quality tradeoffs among
   three different ways to place through-silicon vias (TSVs): TSV-farm,
   TSV-distributed, and TSV-whitespace. In our holistic approach, we use
   wirelength, power, performance, temperature, and mechanical stress
   metrics to conduct comprehensive comparative studies on the three design
   styles. In addition, we provide analysis on the impact of TSV size and
   pitch on the design quality of these three styles.}},

   introduced for both signal and dummy thermal TSVs with the consideration

   clock-tree synthesis as a case-study to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed TSV model, one nonlinear programming-based clock-skew reduction
   problem is formulated to allocate thermal TSVs for clock-skew reduction
   under non-uniform temperature distribution. With a number of 3D
   clock-tree benchmarks, experiments show that under the nonlinear
   electrical-thermal TSV model, insertion of thermal TSVs can effectively
   reduce temperature-gradient introduced clock-skew by 58.4\% on average,
   and has 11.6\% higher clock-skew reduction than the result under linear

Abstract = {{Expected Patch Log Likelihood (EPLL) framework using Gaussian Mixture
   Model (GMM) prior for image restoration was recently proposed with its
   performance comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms. However, EPLL
   uses generic prior trained from offline image patches, which may not
   correctly represent statistics of the current image patches. In this
   paper, we extend the EPLL framework to an adaptive one, named A-EPLL,
   which not only concerns the likelihood of restored patches, but also
   trains the GMM to fit for the degraded image. To efficiently estimate
   GMM parameters in A-EPLL framework, we improve a recent
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by exploiting specific
   structures of GMM from image patches, like Gaussian Scale Models.
   Experiment results show that A-EPLL outperforms the original EPLL
   significantly on several image restoration problems, like inpainting,
   denoising and deblurring.}},

   such exact knowledge, a self-interested bidder will find it profitable
   to either misreport her private information or not participate at the

   based on the agents' class is a useful preprocessing step for

   investigate whether it is possible to apply an exogenous control signal
   to a heterogeneous network of agents, such that these agents form
   clusters of the same class of agents. We demonstrate that if each agent
   belongs to one of M ``weight{''} classes and executes a weighted, forced

   signal that separates the network into M clusters corresponding to the M
   classes of agents.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the compression of a sequence from a mixture
   of K parametric sources. Each parametric source is represented by a
   d-dimensional parameter vector that is drawn from Jeffreys' prior. The
   output of the mixture source is a sequence of length n whose parameter
   is chosen from one of the K source parameter vectors uniformly at
   random. We are interested in the scenario in which the encoder and the
   decoder have a common side information of T sequences generated
   independently by the mixture source (which we refer to as
   memory-assisted universal compression problem). We derive the minimum
   average redundancy of the memoryassisted universal compression of a new
   random sequence from the mixture source and prove that when K = O n d 2
   (1-o) for some o > 0, the side information provided by the previous
   sequences results in significant improvement over the universal
   compression without side information that is a function of n, T, and d.
   On the other hand, as K grows, the impact of the side information
   becomes negligible. Specifically, when K = n d 2 (1+ o) for some o > 0,
   optimal memory-assisted universal compression almost surely offers
   negligible improvement over the universal compression without side
   information. Index Terms-Universal Lossless Compression; Side
   Information; Redundancy-Capacity Theorem; Mixture Source.}},

Abstract = {{This is a student-led paper summarizing a case study on how present-day
   engineering students learn what is needed to innovate solutions, going
   well beyond what is usually taught in course lectures. It is set in the
   context of an aerospace engineering school in an American university,
   with typically large class sizes and a school culture that emphasizes
   research and instruction. Three projects are included in the study,
   progressing in level of complexity. There was some commonality in
   participants between the three. The first is a large open-ended advanced
   concept development exercise in an upper-division course. The second is
   a Capstone Design course. The third is a professional society's
   international level vehicle design team competition. The results show
   where and how students acquired the knowledge, skills, confidence and
   experience to build through the years and reach a level where they could
   innovate and perform with excellence at the level of the international
   competition. The case study is aimed to benefit instructors who are
   interested in improving the depth of their courses as well as improving
   their students' ability to innovate in a meaningful way.}},

   Tutoring Program against other Truss Programs}},

Abstract = {{Mechanix is a sketch recognition program that was developed at Texas
   A\&M University. Mechanix provides an efficient and effective means for
   engineering students to learn how to draw truss free-body diagrams
   (FBDs) and solve truss problems. The Mechanix interface allows for
   students to sketch these FBDs, as they normally would by hand, into a
   tablet computer; a mouse can also be used with a regular computer
   monitor. Mechanix is able to provide immediate and intelligent feedback
   to the students, and it tells them if they are missing any components of
   the FBD. The program is also able to tell students whether their solved
   reaction forces or member forces are correct or not without actually
   providing the answers. A recent and exciting feature of Mechanix is the
   creative design mode which allows students to solve open-ended truss
   problems; an instructor can give their students specific minimum
   requirements for a truss/bridge, and the student uses Mechanix to solve
   and create this truss. The creative design feature of Mechanix can check
   if the students' truss is structurally sound, and if it meets the
   minimum requirements stated by the instructor.
   This paper presents a study to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages
   of using Mechanix in the classroom as a supplement to traditional
   teaching and learning methods. Mechanix is also tested alongside an
   established and popular truss program, WinTruss, to see how learning
   gains differ and what advantages Mechanix offers over other truss
   analysis software. Freshman engineering classes were recruited for this
   experiment and were divided into three conditions: a control condition
   (students who were not exposed to Mechanix or WinTruss and did their
   assignments on paper), a Mechanix condition (students who used Mechanix
   in class and for their assignments, and a WinTruss condition (students
   who used the WinTruss program for their assignments). The learning gains
   among these three groups were evaluated using a series of quantitative
   formal assessments which include a statics concepts inventory, homework
   sets, quizzes, exam grades and truss/bridge creative design solutions.
   Qualitative data was also collected through focus groups for all three
   conditions to gather the students' impressions of the programs for the
   experimental group and general teaching styles for the control group.
   Results from previous evaluations show Mechanix highly engages students
   and helps them learn basic truss mechanics. This evaluation will be
   compared with previous evaluations to show that Mechanix continues to be
   a great tool for enhancing student learning.}},

Abstract = {{Hands-on activities can improve student understanding of STEM topics
   dramatically, and laboratories are the most common implementation of
   hands-on learning. However, most experiments are performed in dedicated
   laboratories, which may be costly and inaccessible to students, and the
   labs may not be timely with respect to when students learn the
   associated theoretical concepts. Mobile hands-on labs are ones that use
   equipment that is affordable and portable, so that students can own the
   equipment and do the labs anywhere anytime. This paper presents three
   models of implementation of mobile hands-on education: a limited number
   of small, in-class labs given in lecture-based courses; full-scale labs
   done on student-owned equipment; and studio classes. These models were
   all implemented in Electrical and Computer Engineering programs, though
   the modules are also used in K-12 outreach activities.}},

Abstract = {{The Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering/Science (SURE) program,
   initiated in 1992, is a ten-week summer program for junior and senior
   level undergraduates from U. S. institutions. The overall goal of the
   program is to expose underrepresented students to engineering research,
   and as a direct consequence, interest them in opportunities available
   through graduate study. Participating students are paired with faculty
   and graduate student social mentors. During their stay, students attend
   weekly seminars on emerging research in engineering fields, enrichment
   and academic development activities, and social events. Students
   conclude the program with research presentations to their peers and
   faculty and graduate student mentors. During the past twenty years, 502
   students participated in the program. These students were selected from
   a pool of 2,554 applicants. A comprehensive assessment program for SURE
   has been developed and implemented. The assessment process is driven by
   the overall program objective to provide participants a meaningful
   research experience and to increase the likelihood that participants
   will attend graduate school in engineering. This model identifies three
   cohorts from which data is collected. Each data source provides unique
   information that contributes to a comprehensive analysis of the impact
   and experiences of program participants and to an understanding of the
   academic trends of all SURE program applicants. The pre-and postprogram
   surveys include a series of questions about participants' perceived
   impact of SURE on planned graduate school attendance and research
   interests. The faculty advisor survey includes questions about the
   contribution the students made to their research programs, whether or
   not their student would succeed in graduate school, the quality of the
   students' oral and written project presentations, and how the program
   could be improved in future years. The Longitudinal Survey of Former
   SURE Participants addresses the primary objective of the SURE program to
   motivate participating students to attend graduate school in
   engineering. Respondents were asked a variety of questions about their
   academic decisions after participating in the SURE program. Detailed
   data about graduate school attendance, degree attainment, and major was
   collected. Questions were included to obtain feedback about their
   co-curricular activities and the environment of their undergraduate
   institutions. Another set of questions referred to sources of
   encouragement that students might have had when deciding to attend
   graduate school. Thus far, the program has been tremendously successful
   in attaining its objectives. It is shown that about 75\% of the students
   who participate in the program attend graduate school after receiving
   their B.S. degrees.}},

Abstract = {{This is a student-led paper describing a multi-year hands-on project.
   The low-cost Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) is a research and
   development testbed, aimed to refine analyses, design features and
   construction techniques that will go into devices suitable for use by a
   family. The testbed integrates knowledge from various disciplines and is
   used to build experience and capabilities. This paper describes how the
   student team, mostly undergraduates, participating in this project have
   been learning what they need to make progress, and to make the
   innovations necessary for success. The paper traces the evolution of the
   multi-year student project, and summarizes recent experience of the team
   that is taking the design to field test readiness. Issues such as safety
   training, development and usage of skills in using hands-on and
   analytical tools, and the process of team organization and progress
   monitoring, are all discussed. Prior work on these topics is extracted
   and summarized as appropriate. The educational aspects of the project
   are then discussed, in the context of the resources and practices that
   we have been developing, to facilitate innovation in multidisciplinary
   endeavors.}},

   The need and approach to advance the depth of comprehension and the

   taken, and data on student performance over the past two years. The
   portfolio of student confirms the excellence demonstrated in tests.
   However, the end-of semester course evaluation and the present
   administrative processes project a negative attitude and severe
   impediments to implementing advancing learning. Pointed comments from
   the better-performing students reveal intense frustration with the
   perceived dilution of work ethic and degree requirements, and cites the
   damage being done to institutions, the industry and the morale of the
   best students by such practices. The innovative aspects of the course
   aimed to advance learning are tabulated with their benefits to the

   educational platform, which has been deployed in the sophomore-level
   introductory Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with the goal of developing
   DSP problem solving skills and comprehension. We discuss it in the
   context of recent research on learning which supports the importance of
   repeated concept retrieval practice, with an emphasis on relevance

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for engaging students with visual
   impairments to learn computer programming through our multi-modal
   feedback system and carefully devised curriculum using a robotic

   interests in the fields of engineering such as computer science and
   robotics. The multi-modal feedback system includes multiple haptic and
   auditory signals that are designed to transfer distinctly defined
   messages during the robot's actions. The curriculum consists of a set of
   task-based tutorials for learning basic programming functions to control
   the robot, as well as intriguing challenge activities such as games.
   This system and curriculum have been deployed in five camps for middle
   and high school students with visual impairments over four different
   cities over two years. We explain the details of our system and the
   activities during the camps, and present the results that show positive
   impacts of our approach in students' interest in computer science and

Abstract = {{Over the past decade and more, many engineering schools have been
   working to implement effective oral presentation in their instruction.
   But the problem of engineering students' lack of oral presentation
   skills persists. During the past three years at Georgia Tech, we have
   built, tested and implemented a set of tools designed to improve student
   presentation skills. The tools are based on empirical research (in
   particular, input from executives with engineering degrees) and include
   a scoring system listing 19 skills, a teachers' guide and a description
   of the ``wow{''} performance for each skill. All instructional materials
   will be available at the presentation.
   In this paper we provide insights into the process of building a
   presentation scoring system for engineers. In part one of the study, we
   describe feedback collected about the scoring system by various
   stakeholders (faculty, administrators, graduate students, undergraduate
   students). We describe the categories of comments, such as which segment
   of the skill was focused on by the respondents when they were rating the
   skill, for example, although the definition for Relevant Details
   included concrete details and details familiar to the audience, the
   respondents focused only on the quality of the details. Overall, these
   comments indicated some skills are rated more consistently than others
   among different raters. Second, we describe how we gathered reactions
   from different stakeholders to the feedback in part one. We provide the
   categories of the comments and examples, such as in complete consensus,
   all respondents agree that the skill of Appropriate Language is easy to
   rate.
   We also describe our current work to improve the inter-rater reliability
   of some of the skills we have identified. We are using a modified Delphi
   method to improve the inter-rater reliability and are in the process of
   implementing the revised suite of tools in three very different
   engineering departments (Industrial, Biomedical, and Aerospace) at
   Georgia Tech. The Delphi method is a process of structured communication
   designed to aid a group of individuals in coming to consensus about a
   complex issue. Our communication process involves two rounds of feedback
   from various stakeholders: faculty, students, teaching assistants, and
   executives.
   Finally, we summarize how the stakeholder suggestions were used to
   modify the Norback \& Utschig Presentation Scoring System, reducing it
   from 19 skills to 13 skills. For example, the definition for the skill
   of Personal Presence (which includes energy, inflection, eye contact and
   movement) was changed to include three of the four, with inflection
   being moved into the skill of Vocal Quality.}},

Abstract = {{Engineers have a predictable way of working. A text (T) or verbal
   description of a problem is translated into a diagram (D) which
   bootstraps the creation of a symbolic/mathematical (S) model for further
   analysis. Learning to solve problems in this particular way is a major
   goal for engineering education. The research presented in this paper
   focuses specifically on the text to diagram translation and the
   particularized representations utilized within a course on conservation
   principles. Previous research on student-generated diagrams revealed
   that, at the beginning of the course, students are not able to construct
   useful diagrams that follow the conservation laws. This result led to
   the general question of whether students can recognize useful, correct
   diagrams; more specifically: 1) Given a set of diagrams, are students
   able to distinguish between effective and ineffective diagrams? and 2)
   How do students' judgments compare with those of an expert? To answer
   these questions, we conducted an exploratory study of students' ranking
   of a set of diagrams for a complex, multi-unit problem. We compared them
   to those of an expert using Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient in a
   cluster analysis. These findings are complimented by results from the
   post-exercise class discussion regarding criteria for a good diagram and
   have important implications for teaching and for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Many assistive tasks involve manipulation near the care-receiver's body,
   including self-care tasks such as dressing, feeding, and personal
   hygiene. A robot can provide assistance with these tasks by moving its
   end effector to poses near the care-receiver's body. However, perceiving
   and maneuvering around the care-receiver's body can be challenging due
   to a variety of issues, including convoluted geometry, compliant
   materials, body motion, hidden surfaces, and the object upon which the
   body is resting (e.g., a wheelchair or bed). Using geometric
   simulations, we first show that an assistive robot can achieve a much
   larger percentage of end-effector poses near the care-receiver's body if
   its arm is allowed to make contact. Second, we present a novel system
   with a custom controller and whole-arm tactile sensor array that enables
   a Willow Garage PR2 to regulate contact forces across its entire arm
   while moving its end effector to a commanded pose. We then describe
   tests with two people with motor impairments, one of whom used the
   system to grasp and pull a blanket over himself and to grab a cloth and
   wipe his face, all while in bed at his home. Finally, we describe a
   study with eight able-bodied users in which they used the system to
   place objects near their bodies. On average, users perceived the system
   to be safe and comfortable, even though substantial contact occurred
   between the robot's arm and the user's body.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, robot-assisted rehabilitation has gained momentum as a
   viable means for improving outcomes for therapeutic interventions. Such
   therapy experiences allow controlled and repeatable trials and
   quantitative evaluation of mobility metrics. Typically though these
   robotic devices have been focused on rehabilitation within a clinical
   setting. In these traditional robot-assisted rehabilitation studies,
   participants are required to perform goal-directed movements with the
   robot during a therapy session. This requires physical contact between
   the participant and the robot to enable precise control of the task, as
   well as a means to collect relevant performance data. On the other hand,
   non-contact means of robot interaction can provide a safe methodology
   for extracting the control data needed for in-home rehabilitation. As
   such, in this paper we discuss a contact and non-contact based method
   for upper-arm rehabilitation exercises that enables quantification of
   upper-arm movements. We evaluate our methodology on upper-arm
   abduction/adduction movements and discuss the advantages and limitations
   of each approach as applied to an in-home rehabilitation scenario.}},

Abstract = {{There has been little research that studies the effect of partitioning
   on parallel simulation of multicore systems. This paper presents our
   study of this important problem in the context of Null-message-based
   synchronization algorithm for parallel multicore simulation. This paper
   focuses on coarse grain parallel simulation where each core and its
   cache slices are modeled within a single logical process (LP) and
   different partitioning schemes are only applied to the interconnection
   network. In this paper we show that encapsulating the entire on-chip
   interconnection network into a single logical process is an impediment
   to scalable simulation. This baseline partitioning and two other schemes
   are investigated. Experiments are conducted on a subset of the PARSEC
   benchmarks with 16-, 32-, 64-and 128-core models. Results show that the
   partitioning scheme has a significant impact on simulation performance
   and parallel efficiency. Beyond a certain system scale, one scheme
   consistently outperforms the other two schemes, and the performance as
   well as efficiency gaps increases as the size of the model increases
   -with up to 4.1 times faster speed and 277\% better efficiency for
   128-core models. We explain the reasons for this behavior, which can be
   traced to the features of the Null-message-based synchronization
   algorithm. Because of this, we believe that, if a component has
   increasing number of inter-LP interactions with increasing system size,
   such components should be partitioned into several sub-components to
   achieve better performance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in same-frequency/same-time full-duplex radio frequency
   communication has led to the study of self-interference cancellation
   methods for a co-located transmitter and receiver pair. So far,
   important practical aspects of self-interference cancellation have not
   been considered, such as receiver amplifier saturation and dynamic
   range, which extend the minimum distance between transmit and receive
   antennas without sufficient interference isolation. Further, current
   solutions lack significant self-interference attenuation for wideband
   signals. In this paper, a method for canceling a passband
   self-interference signal using adaptive filtering in the digital domain
   is presented. Based on acoustic active noise cancellation foundations, a
   cancellation signal is created that destructively combines with the
   undesired self-interference signal in the passband, taking into account
   differences in the complex passband nature of RF signals versus the
   baseband nature of acoustic signals. The efficacy of this interference
   cancellation scheme is compared to other self-interference cancellation
   architectures in the literature including digital as well as other
   active passband approaches. It is shown that for high-power wideband
   transmission signals, this adaptive active analog cancellation method
   effectively reduces the self-interference signal while satisfying
   practical constraints set by transceiver hardware. It is also shown that
   this approach decreases the minimum distance between the transmit and
   receive antennas or allows higher transmission power, thereby extending
   the range of a full-duplex device.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain equalization (FDE) is a low-complexity approach to
   remove the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) introduced by
   propagation over a frequency-selective channel. In this paper, we
   present a novel receiver architecture for frequency-domain equalization
   of multi-h continuous phase modulation (CPM). The receiver front-end is
   a matched-filter bank, which is derived from a Laurent decomposition of
   the signal. A circulant-matrix model obtained for the samples of the
   matched filter is used to perform the equalization in frequency domain.
   It is shown that receiver complexity can be reduced by allowing a slight
   degradation in performance. The reduction in the complexity of the
   equalizer is proposed by dropping the FDE branches corresponding to
   low-energy Laurent pulses. It is observed that the loss in performance
   is acceptable even when a few significant branches are considered.
   Simulation results are presented for the IRIG-106 aeronautical telemetry
   dual-h CPM waveform.}},

Abstract = {{In LTE uplink systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access
   (SC-FDMA) has been employed. In SC-FDMA, orthogonal frequency resources
   are assigned to different users to avoid intra-cell interference.
   However, inter-cell interference (ICI) caused by the users in
   neighboring cells significantly deteriorates the performance.
   Cooperation among base stations must be used to deal with ICI for
   multi-cell systems. In this paper, we investigate multi-cell scheduling
   in SC-FDMA for LTE uplink. We propose a novel cooperative scheduling
   algorithm that takes inter-cluster and intra-cluster interference into
   account. We first perform coordinated scheduling and then link
   adaptation to select modulation and coding scheme (MCS). Simulation
   results show that the proposed algorithm has significant gains over the
   single-cell proportional fair (PF) scheduling algorithm on both
   cell-edge and average throughput. It also outperforms the existing
   cooperative algorithm under full pathloss compensation and fractional
   open-loop power control (OLPC).}},

Abstract = {{The energy consumption reduction in cellular systems is important from
   both economic and environmental perspectives. Nearly 80\% of the energy
   in cellular systems is consumed by the Radio Access Network (RAN). In
   recent years, much research has been done to reduce the energy
   consumption in the RAN. However, existing models fail to capture the
   spatio-temporal variability of traffic demands, bit rate and power
   requirements, as well as the peculiarities in the energy consumption
   from different hardware components in a base station (BS). In this
   paper, a new RAN energy consumption model for multi-layer
   infrastructure-based heterogeneous wireless systems (IbHWS) is proposed.
   It captures all the aforementioned factors and accurately addresses the
   characteristics of IbHWS, where cellular systems are a particular case.
   A low-complexity algorithm is proposed to minimize the RAN's energy
   consumption, and to satisfy all traffic demands in space and time. Based
   on extensive simulation results across a wide range of scenarios, the
   energy savings from this algorithm were on average 26\%.}},

Abstract = {{The consensus problem appears frequently in the coordination of
   muItiagent systems in science and engineering and involves the agreement
   of networked agents upon certain quantities of interest. In this paper,
   we focus on a new consensus protocol for networked multiagent systems.
   The proposed control protocol consists of a standard term capturing
   relative position information and a new term capturing neighboring
   velocity information. In particular, the addition of the latter term
   results in an increase of the rate of system convergence while
   maintaining a fixed graph structure and without increasing the maximum
   eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Furthermore, in certain cases, it is
   shown that the maximum singular value of the graph Laplacian is not
   increased. This departs from the traditional view that the Fiedler
   eigenvalue, a function of graph structure, governors the system's rate
   of convergence. In addition, it is shown that a connected and undirected
   graph topology acts as a weighted complete graph topology with the
   addition of this latter term to a standard consensus protocol. A
   comparative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the advantages
   of this new consensus protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Most current Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) methods rely on
   parametric adaptive elements, in which the number of parameters of the
   adaptive element are fixed a-priori, often through expert judgment.
   Examples of such adaptive elements are the commonly used Radial Basis
   Function Networks (RBFNs) with pre-allocated centers allocated based on
   the expected operating domain. A severe limitation of such RBFN MRAC
   methods is that if the system operates outside of the expected operating
   domain, such adaptive elements can become non-effective, thus rendering
   the adaptive controller only semi-global in nature. This paper treats
   system uncertainties as distributions over functions and proposes
   Gaussian Process based adaptive elements. We show that these Bayesian
   nonparametric adaptive elements guarantee good closed loop performance
   with minimal prior domain knowledge of the uncertainty through
   stochastic stability arguments. Online implementable GP inference method
   are evaluated in simulations and compared with RBFN adaptive controllers
   with pre-allocated centers. The results indicate that GP-MRAC overcomes
   the limitations of MRAC employing RBFN with fixed parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Two-wheeled inverted pendulums can be used as personal transporters.
   Their maneuverability and small footprint give them desirable properties
   for this application. However, they are intrinsically unstable and their
   dynamic response can be significantly different depending on what type
   of person is riding the transporter. Therefore, the feedback controller
   that stabilizes the machine must be robust to these dynamic variations.
   In this paper, dynamic characteristics of a Segway i2 are investigated.
   The variation in the dynamic properties as a function of the rider
   parameters of weight and center of mass height is reported. It is shown
   that the pitching frequency changes significantly as a function of rider
   weight and center of mass height.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of implementing a principal's decision
   truthfully in a private-value, correlated environment in which agents
   receive information over time. This setting comprises a deviation from
   the literature of dynamic mechanism design that typically employs the
   assumption that the distribution of an agent's private signal is
   independent of other agents' private information history conditional on
   past public decisions. We derive sufficient conditions for designing
   monetary transfers that guarantee implementation of the desired policy
   in a periodic ex post incentive compatible equilibrium. For risk neutral
   agents in a finite state, finite action Markovian environment this set
   of sufficient conditions reduces to a finite set of linear inequalities.
   This is an appealing feature given that the agent is faced with a
   partial observation stochastic optimization problem with progressively
   increasing information state. The class of mechanisms considered in our
   methodology include the dynamic VCG algorithm that has been developed
   for the case where agents' dynamics are coupled only through the
   principal's decision. Besides implementing the desired policy, the
   principal may want to impose specifications on the expected revenue or
   model her uncertainty regarding her knowledge of agents' perceived
   environment. We show how our conditions for periodic ex post incentive
   compatibility can be incorporated as part of a robust optimization
   approach to policy implementation that takes these additional
   requirements into account.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a general class of stochastic optimal control problems for
   which the problem of designing optimal linear feedback gains is convex.
   The class of problems includes arbitrary time varying linear systems and
   costs that are mixtures of exponentiated quadratics. This allows us to
   model problems with quadratic state costs and linear constraints on
   states and state transitions. Further, convexity in the feedback gains
   lets us impose arbitrary convex constraints or penalties on the feedback
   matrix: Thus we can model problems like distributed control (by imposing
   a sparsity structure on the feedback matrix) and variable-stiffness
   control (by applying time-varying penalties to feedback gain matrices).
   We show that the convex optimization problem can be solved efficiently
   by using the structure of the matrices involved. Finally, we present an
   application of these ideas to a practical problem arising in distributed
   control of power systems.}},

Abstract = {{The setup of learning in networked systems is a collection of decision
   making components with local information and limited communication
   interacting to balance a collective objective with local incentives.
   This talk presents a tutorial overview of learning in such settings from
   a game theoretic perspective. While game theory is well known for its
   traditional role as a modeling framework in social sciences, it is
   seeing growing interest as a design approach for distributed
   architecture control. In game theoretic learning, the focus shifts away
   from equilibrium solution concepts and towards the dynamics of how
   decision makers reach equilibrium. This talk presents a sampling of
   results in game theoretic learning from its origins as a
   ``descriptive{''} model for social systems to its ``prescriptive{''}
   role as an approach to designing networked control. The talk presents
   also presents various examples from distributed coordination.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a power-aware sleep scheduling scheme for a
   randomly deployed wireless sensor network comprising of sensors with
   varying footprints, akin to those of RF-or radar-based sensors. For this
   scheme, we first relate the performance of a sensor to its available
   power and then extend this relationship to the performance of the entire
   network. Then, to compensate for the effects of decrease in available
   power, we propose probabilistic scheduling controllers that maintain a
   desired probability of event detection. The key novelty in this work as
   compared to our previous work is that the proposed scheduling controller
   does not make any assumptions about the power decay model, which makes
   it suitable for practical implementation. Moreover, the proposed
   controller can also take care of increase in available power which is
   possible in practical systems with energy harvesting technologies. In
   addition to maintaining desired event detection probability, the
   proposed scheme is completely decentralized since it requires neither
   any global information nor any local communication for computing the
   control parameter at any time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the issue of activity scheduling of sensors in
   heterogeneous wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs), thereby
   proposing an energy-efficient data collection scheme in such networks.
   In order to extend the lifetime of heterogeneous WSANs, sensors are
   activated and deactivated under certain constraints throughout the
   network operations. Here, we propose a coordination framework in which
   actors exchange information with each other and decide about the
   availability of redundant sensors that are eventually deactivated to
   save energy. In particular, let there be r different types of sensors
   with each sensor observing a particular sensing parameter. Under the
   initial deployment of sensors and actors within some field of
   observation, if an actor v receives information regarding k different
   sensing parameters, either directly from sensors or through other
   actors, then our scheme determines a small subset of sensors that are
   sufficient to provide information regarding the same k sensing
   parameters to v.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a robust plume tracking strategy using mobile sensor networks
   in three dimensional (3D) fields. Inspired by the plume tracking
   behavior of blue crabs, we propose a stochastic model of plume spikes
   detected by sensing agents based on the Poisson counting process, which
   enables us to transform the turbulent plume field detected by sensing
   agents to a continuously-differential field, the minimum of which is
   considered as a source in the field, and shares the same location with
   the plume source. The transformation allows us to design and analyze
   source-seeking algorithms in smooth fields instead of in turbulent
   fields with higher fluctuation spatially and temporally. Inspired by
   fish schools that seek darker (shaded) regions in environments with
   complex lighting variations, we develop a distributed source-seeking
   algorithm using mobile sensor networks without explicit gradient
   estimation. The velocity of each agent is designed using only the
   measurements taken by the agent and the relative positions to its
   neighboring agents. We prove that, using this design, the moving
   direction of a three-agent group will converge to the opposite gradient
   direction of the field, thus, the group moves towards a source in the
   field. We also prove that the tracking system is input-to-state stable
   (ISS), indicating that the system is robust to disturbances. We then
   generalize the design to N-agent groups, and demonstrate the strategy in
   both smooth fields and turbulent fields in simulations.}},

Abstract = {{It is often very difficult for human operators to control cranes due to

   is made even harder by awkward control interfaces. Portable touchscreen
   devices offer the opportunity to improve the control interface by
   replacing traditional push-button pendent and joystick-based
   controllers. This paper presents several classes of touchscreen
   interfaces that are coupled with an oscillation-supressing control
   system. Some interfaces are further augmented with a rotating reference
   frame of control that changes the control directions based on the
   direction that the touchscreen controller is pointing. Results from
   operator studies demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{We design an estimator for the position of a rocket car. The scheme is
   based on a novel idea of delay measurements in a realistic scenario.
   Ultrasonic sensors are used to give the measurement of the delay. The
   delay depends implicitly on the state of the system. This gives rise to
   a time delay system with a state-dependent delay which is a challenging
   research avenue. The central theme is to use inversion of the delay
   model and to extract the state vector given the delay. The overall
   system is nonlinear because of the state-dependent delay. We design an
   asymptotic observer for estimating the position of the system using
   delay information. We call or refer to this new technique as Delay
   Injection. We show that the error dynamics involve a time-varying delay
   instead of a state-dependent delay and this makes the problem tractable.
   A brief outline of the nonlinear observation for the autonomous system
   is also given. Though rocket car is a particular motivating example, the
   approach presented in this article can be used for the on-line
   estimation of states of generic systems from state-dependent delays
   affecting the system dynamics. Simulation results are given at the end
   which demonstrate the effectiveness, validity and usefulness of the

Abstract = {{Singular control has been extensively studied for the linear-quadratic
   regulator problem for achieving asymptotic stability of controlled
   linear systems with cheap control. In this paper, the singular control
   problem is extended to guarantee a weaker form of closed-loop stability,
   namely, semistability, which is of paramount importance for consensus
   control of network dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that the
   optimal state-feedback controller for the semistable linear-quadratic
   regulator problem can be solved using an algebraic Riccati equation.
   This result allows us to address the semistable singular control problem
   and obtain several expressions for the minimum cost of a semistabilizing
   singular controller. In particular, after establishing connections
   between Qui and Davison's formula for the minimum cost of a cheap
   controller and our results, we prove that the cost of a semistabilizing
   singular controller is zero if and only if the controlled system is
   minimum phase and right invertible.}},

Abstract = {{Networked multi-agent systems are widely modeled as graphs where the
   agents are represented as nodes and edges exist between the agents that
   interact directly. In this setting, the degree of a node is the number
   of edges incident to it. For such systems, degree regularity (uniformity
   of degree across the nodes) typically provides desirable properties such
   as robustness and fast mixing time. As such, a key task is to achieve
   degree regularization in a decentralized manner. In this paper, we
   present a locally applicable rule that achieves this task. For any

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of optimizing the (long-term)
   performance of operations that are modeled by Generalized Stochastic
   Petri nets. The proposed methodology employs the representational power
   of the GSPN framework in order to articulate an explicit trade-off
   between the computational tractability of the formulated problem and the
   operational efficiency of the derived solutions. On the other hand, the
   solution of the considered formulations is based on recent results
   regarding the sensitivity analysis of Markov reward processes. A more
   expansive treatment of the presented results, together with a case study
   that highlights the relevance of the considered problem and the efficacy
   of the proposed methodology, can be found in a companion document that

Abstract = {{When Perturbation Analysis (PA) yields unbiased sensitivity estimators
   for expected-value performance functions in discrete event dynamic
   systems, it can be used for performance optimization of those functions.
   However, when PA is known to be unbiased, the complexity of its
   estimators often does not scale with the system's size. The purpose of
   this paper is to suggest an alternative approach to optimization which
   balances precision with computing efforts by trading off complicated,
   unbiased PA estimators for simple, biased approximate estimators.
   Furthermore, we provide guidelines for developing such estimators, that
   are largely based on the Stochastic Flow Modeling framework. We suggest
   that if the relative error (or bias) is not too large, then optimization
   algorithms such as stochastic approximation converge to a (local)
   minimum just like in the case where no approximation is used. We apply
   this approach to an example of balancing loss with buffer-cost in a
   finite-buffer queue, and prove a crucial upper bound on the relative
   error. This paper presents the initial study of the proposed approach,
   and we believe that if the idea gains traction then it may lead to a
   significant expansion of the scope of PA in optimization of discrete
   event systems.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the light extraction efficiency is one of the key technologies
   for high brightness LED packaging, and is of great importance for the
   semiconductor illumination industry. Due to the large refractive index
   (RI) difference between LED chip and outside medium, the light will be
   trapped in the LED, convert into heat, and further lower the conversion
   efficiency. Encapsulants such as epoxy and silicone are usually added to
   decrease the RI contrast and increase the angle of light escape cone.
   But the RI is usually limited to 1.45 to 1.55. Higher RI particles can
   be added to further increase the RI of LED encapsulant. The particle
   size should be controlled smaller than one tenth of the visible light
   wavelength, in order to reduce Rayleigh scattering. In this study, we
   prepared TiO2 nanoparticles/silicone nanocomoposites as LED encapsulant.
   The dispersion of nanoprticles was further improved through silane
   treatment. As a result, the RI of nanocomposites increased from 1.54 to
   1.62 at 589 nm wavelength with 5 wt\% filler loading while maintaining
   high relative transmittance.}},

Abstract = {{The MapReduce programming model, along with its open-source
   implementation - Hadoop - has provided a cost effective solution for
   many data-intensive applications. Hadoop stores data distributively and
   exploits data locality by assigning tasks to where data is stored. In
   many cases, however, accessing remote data (rack-local and off-rack) is
   inevitable. In this paper we are evaluating the possibility of improving
   the remote data accessing performance by streaming data from multiple
   available replicas. The proposed design consists of a circular buffer, a
   slice reader and a enhanced DataNode. Such system is capable of adapting
   to both the static performance variance caused by network topology as
   well as dynamic variance caused by congestion. Extensive experiments
   show that mutil-source streaming can significantly improve the
   throughput of remote data access and accelerate the related map tasks by
   10\%-20\%. In some imbalanced environment, the proposed system can even
   achieve as much as 4x speedup.}},

Abstract = {{We consider disruption tolerant networks (DTNs) wherein a direct
   communication path from a source to a destination via multiple hops does
   not exist due to both mobility and sparseness of the nodes. Hence,
   mobile nodes will deliver messages from source to destination using a
   ``store, carry, and forward{''} strategy. In this paper, our goal is to
   analytically study the packet latency in such networks for a two-hop
   unicast scenario with Bernoulli packet arrivals at the source. We
   exploit an embedded Markov chain approach combined with our novel
   iterative estimation technique to study both network delay and queuing
   delay. Constraints posed by both the limited node buffer size and
   contention between nodes for wireless channel are also considered to
   obtain a more realistic model. Finally, our results are validated using
   simulations for a random-walk on a two-dimensional grid mobility model.}},

Abstract = {{A Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is used as a Virtual Backbone (VB) for
   efficient routing and broadcasting in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).
   Currently, almost all existing works focus on constructing Minimum-sized
   CDS under the Deterministic Network Model (DNM). However, due to the
   existence of many probabilistic lossy links in WSNs, it is more
   practical to obtain a VB under the realistic Probabilistic Network Model
   (PNM). Moreover, load-balance factor cannot be neglected when
   constructing a VB to prolong network lifetime. Hence, in this paper, we
   propose a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to construct a
   Load-Balanced Virtual Backbone under PNM (LBVBP). Through simulations,
   we demonstrate that our proposed methods extend network lifetime by 65\%
   on average compared with the existing state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) present a variety of new
   research challenges. Recently, a magneto-inductive (MI) waveguide
   technique has been proposed to cope with the very harsh propagation

   transmission range, which can be quite limited if relays are not
   deployed. In this paper, tree-based WUSNs are considered with sensors

   technology to alleviate the spectrum shortage and under-utilization

   However, little attention has been paid to data aggregation problem, one
   of the most important communication protocols in wireless networks due
   to its efficiency in both energy conservation and latency reduction. In
   this paper, we investigate the minimum latency data aggregation
   scheduling problem in CRNs. Considering the difficulty of this problem,
   two practical distributed algorithms under the Unit Disk Graph

Abstract = {{A theoretical and experimental investigation of the nonlinear behaviors

   radio-over-fiber (RoF) system is presented for the first time. A
   closed-form theoretical analysis is proposed to characterize and

   modulator (MZM). Nonlinear behaviors of the intra-band XM between the
   in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components of a single-band vector signal,
   as well as the inter-band XM between multiband combinations of scalar
   and vector signals are investigated, and consistent agreement has been
   verified between the theory and experiments. It was confirmed that
   scalar signals only suffer from inter-band XM; whereas vector signals
   suffer from both intra-and inter-band XMs. Intra-band XM induces
   constellation compression to vector signals; while inter-band XM induces
   eye diagram degradation to scalar signals, as well as nonlinear
   constellation scaling to vector signals. Moreover, QPSK shows superior
   tolerance to MZM nonlinearity than higher order QAM formats due to it
   intrinsic resistance to intra-band XM.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) systems can provide illumination and
   communication simultaneously by way of light emitting diodes (LEDs). The
   communication function is achieved by employing simple and low-cost
   intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) schemes. Brightness
   control and flicker mitigation are two main challenges for the
   illumination function. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   has been considered for VLC for its ability to boost data rates.
   However, OFDM waveforms have high peak-to-average power ratio, and will
   be clipped if its magnitude is beyond the dynamic range of LEDs.
   Clipping can cause the performance degradation of communication as well
   as illumination. In this paper, we will propose an iterative clipping
   method considering brightness control and flicker mitigation. We will
   investigate the performance in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM) as
   well as computational complexity. We will formulate the EVM minimization
   problem as a convex optimization problem to compare with the iterative
   clipping method.}},

Abstract = {{Small cells are redefining the traditional cellular system concepts.
   Coordination among small cells offers several benefits in terms of
   utilizing existing network infrastructure to support advanced
   interference management, mobility management as well as self-organizing
   (SON) functions. In this work, the problem of handover management is
   studied. The coordination between small cells is generally not
   considered in many existing handover management solutions resulting in
   increased handover cost, session interruption time and core network
   overload. To this end, a novel local anchor-based architecture for
   coordinated small cells is proposed in this paper based on which three
   handover schemes are presented. A mathematical framework is developed to
   analyze the performance of the proposed schemes and Markov models are
   utilized to obtain closed-form expressions for key handover parameters
   including handover cost and session interruption time. Numerical results
   show savings of about 60\% in the signaling cost, about 50\% in the data
   forwarding cost and more importantly about 80\% in the handover
   interruption time compared to existing schemes based on coordinated
   small cells.}},

Abstract = {{Small Cells (SCs) have emerged as one of the main solutions to the
   exponential growth of data in mobile networks. Still, some key

   operations: Location Updates (LUs) and paging. The standard solution for
   location management provided by 3GPP defines LU and paging with Tracking
   Area List (TAL) granularity. However, these procedures are no longer
   appropriate in SCs for two reasons: first, smaller coverage areas
   increase mobility among cells; second, backhaul capacity limitations set
   tighter restrictions on the signaling load. In this paper, two schemes
   for location update and paging are proposed, namely, X2-Interface-based
   scheme with SC updates and X2-Interface-based scheme with Tracking Area
   (TA) updates. These schemes reduce paging through the use of a local
   anchor to keep track of users' location inside the TAL. Furthermore, the
   processing cost is reduced by allowing connectivity among SCs through
   the X2 interface. The numerical results show that the proposed solutions
   reduce the total cost associated with location update and paging in
   relation to the 3GPP-based scheme with TAL granularity.}},

Abstract = {{Information-theoretic secret-key generation often requires the
   legitimate users to know the eavesdropper's statistics, which might not

   channel model with unknown and arbitrarily varying channel states at the
   eavesdropper. We first develop an achievable secret-key rate in the case
   of finite alphabets. We then extend the result to multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) channels with continuous alphabets. In this case,
   we show that a positive secret-key rate, optimal in terms of secure
   degrees of freedom, is achievable if the eavesdropper has strictly less

Abstract = {{Traditionally, a coordination scheme of circuit breakers (CBs),
   reclosers, and sectionalizers using time current curves has been widely
   used for radial networks with a single supply site or loop networks with
   two distribution feeders tied by a normally open tie recloser. However,
   conventional schemes that rely only on current information reclose onto
   a fault. This major drawback occurs when a normally open tie recloser
   closes onto the other supply of the system because the load side
   recloser closest to the fault location is not able to locate the fault
   condition. This paper proposes a new circuit breaker, recloser, and
   sectionalizer coordination scheme, referred to as the voltage, current,
   and time (VIT) scheme. Integral parts of the VIT scheme are
   strategically applied counters and timers on the protection devices. The
   VIT protection devices can detect a fault condition from both upstream
   and downstream of a fault location and assist in isolating only the
   faulted part of the circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated and in-core implementations of Big Data applications
   typically require large amounts of host and accelerator memory as well
   as efficient mechanisms for transferring data to and from accelerators
   in heterogeneous clusters. Scheduling for heterogeneous CPU and GPU
   clusters has been investigated in depth in the high-performance
   computing (HPC) and cloud computing arenas, but there has been less
   emphasis on the management of cluster resource that is required to
   schedule applications across multiple nodes and devices. Previous
   approaches to address this resource management problem have focused on
   either using low-performance software layers or on adapting complex data
   movement techniques from the HPC arena, which reduces performance and
   creates barriers for migrating applications to new heterogeneous cluster
   architectures.
   This work proposes a new system architecture for cluster resource
   allocation and data movement built around the concept of managed Global
   Address Spaces (GAS), or dynamically aggregated memory regions that span
   multiple nodes. We propose a software layer called Oncilla that uses a
   simple runtime and API to take advantage of non-coherent hardware
   support for GAS. The Oncilla runtime is evaluated using two different
   high-performance networks for microkernels representative of the TPC-H
   data warehousing benchmark, and this runtime enables a reduction in
   runtime of up to 81\%, on average, when compared with standard
   disk-based data storage techniques. The use of the Oncilla API is also
   evaluated for a simple breadth-first search (BFS) benchmark to
   demonstrate how existing applications can incorporate support for
   managed GAS.}},

Abstract = {{A hidden-node problem is one of the major challenges that cause severe
   performance degradation in wireless adhoc networks. Even though RTS/CTS
   (Request To Send / Clear To Send) exchange can remove the hidden-node
   problem, the inefficiency of exchanging the RTS/CTS has brought
   attentions to many researchers. While most of these efforts have been
   focused on the theoretical analysis, very little efforts were given to
   the verification of proposed models through real-world experiments.
   Random-bit error is another important factor that deteriorates the
   network performance in wireless environments. Through rigorous
   real-world experiments, this paper demonstrates a feasible methodology
   to enhance network throughput in the existence of hidden nodes by using
   optimal fragments. Our previous analytical model that incorporates the
   impact by random-bit error and hidden nodes on the throughput is
   validated under various real-world environments. These experimental
   results will provide a solid foundation to the research communities in
   solving the hidden-node problem in noisy MANET environments.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of research has been done in the last several years on
   information centric networking (ICN), where named data items, rather
   than end host identities, are the primary routable entities. Several
   prototypes have been proposed, but all face daunting concerns in the
   areas of performance, complexity, backwards compatibility, and user
   security and privacy. We propose a protocol which creates
   globally-unique data item names and embeds these names, plus associated
   metadata, into an IPv6 header. We then show how this allows the use of
   the IPsec suite of protocols to mitigate user privacy and security
   concerns. Next, we show that using RFC-compliant IPv6 datagrams as the
   named content allows content routing to be done using standard gateway
   protocols and also ensures backwards compatibility with unmodified
   networks. Lastly, we give an example of how the CLIP header's structure
   will simplify the design of automatic caches in the network.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an error-correcting system that combines polar codes with
   turbo equalization for partial response channels. The successive
   cancellation decoder, originally proposed by Arikan for polar codes,
   does not produce the soft outputs needed for turbo processing. The
   belief propagation decoder, on the other hand, requires many iterations
   and has high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a
   soft-input soft-output variant of the successive cancellation decoder
   that produces the soft information required for turbo architectures,
   while keeping the computational complexity low. Numerical results show
   that the proposed decoder performs better than the hard-output
   successive cancellation decoder and the belief propagation decoder in

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the cross layer design and optimization for
   delay quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning in spectrum sharing
   femtocell networks. Our goal is to find the optimal resource allocation
   policy to maximize the throughput for each femtocell user, addressing
   the co-channel interference problem in the physical layer and the
   individual statistical delayQoS guarantee problem from the upper layers.
   The statistical delay-QoS requirement is characterized by the QoS
   exponent. By integrating the concept of effective capacity, the
   cross-layer optimization problem is formulated as an effective capacity
   maximization game. With partial dual decomposition, this game is solved
   through a hierarchical structure. Specifically, we derive the optimal
   power allocation policy for femtocell users and design a distributed
   algorithm to obtain the Nash Equilibrium (N.E.). Numerical results show
   that the proposed policy can efficiently improve the performance of the
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative transmission (CT), in which spatially separated wireless
   nodes collaborate to form a virtual antenna array or virtual
   multiple-input-multiple-output (VMISO) link, is an effective technique
   to mitigate multi-path fading by spatial diversity. In this paper, we
   study the disparities in path losses between the randomly placed relay
   nodes in a transmit cluster and the destination nodes. Many authors
   assume that the elements in a virtual antenna array are co-located, even
   though they are spread out. In this paper, we show that a
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) penalty of up to 3dB should be included when
   making this assumption. By the high-SNR approximation of the outage
   rates, we show that the performance degradation caused by the path-loss
   disparity can be characterized equivalently by log-normal shadowing.
   Moreover, we derive the upper and lower bounds of the real outage
   probabilities in closed forms based on the log-normal shadowing model,
   by which we can estimate the SNR penalty of the co-located assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Smallcell technology is gaining significance as part of the
   next-generation cellular systems due to their performance benefits in
   terms of increased network capacity and improved indoor and local
   coverage. Hybrid access smallcells, which provide service to both indoor
   as well as neighboring users, adopt adhoc policies to guarantee
   performance benefits to indoor home users in the presence of external
   neighboring users. Such policies must be able to stabilize user queues
   as well as to provision performance benefits in terms of delay and
   throughput, especially for the indoor users. As a result, classification
   of user data in terms of traffic type and user type is required to
   effectively achieve the differentiated QoS performance.
   In this paper, a traffic-aware utility function is proposed, which takes
   into account for the user's priority index and traffic characteristics
   to efficiently provide differentiated QoS benefits to users served under
   an OFDMA hybrid smallcell. The problem of the traffic-aware utility
   based scheduling under power constraints is posed as an optimization
   objective and an optimal algorithm for the scheduling problem is
   presented. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves QoS
   performance benefits in terms of throughput and delay.}},

Abstract = {{Hashing techniques have been intensively investigated in the design of
   highly efficient search engines for large-scale computer vision
   applications. Compared with prior approximate nearest neighbor search
   approaches like tree-based indexing, hashing-based search schemes have
   prominent advantages in terms of both storage and computational
   efficiencies. Moreover, the procedure of devising hash functions can be
   easily incorporated into sophisticated machine learning tools, leading
   to data-dependent and task-specific compact hash codes. Therefore, a
   number of learning paradigms, ranging from unsupervised to supervised,
   have been applied to compose appropriate hash functions. However, most
   of the existing hash function learning methods either treat hash
   function design as a classification problem or generate binary codes to
   satisfy pairwise supervision, and have not yet directly optimized the
   search accuracy. In this paper, we propose to leverage listwise
   supervision into a principled hash function learning framework. In
   particular, the ranking information is represented by a set of rank
   triplets that can be used to assess the quality of ranking. Simple
   linear projection-based hash functions are solved efficiently through
   maximizing the ranking quality over the training data. We carry out
   experiments on large image datasets with size up to one million and
   compare with the state-of-the-art hashing techniques. The extensive
   results corroborate that our learned hash codes via listwise supervision
   can provide superior search accuracy without incurring heavy
   computational overhead.}},

   applied input pressure to the lungs is in general nonnegative and cannot

   with bounded nonnegative control inputs is proposed. The controller only
   uses output information (i.e., the total volume of the lungs) and
   automatically adjusts the applied input pressure so that the system is
   able to track a given reference signal in the presence of parameter
   uncertainty (i.e., modelling uncertainty of the lung resistances and
   lung compliances) and system disturbances. Controllers for both matched
   and unmatched uncertainty are presented. Specifically, a Lyapunov-based
   approach is presented for the stability analysis of the system and the
   proposed control framework is applied to a two-compartment lung model to
   show the efficacy of the proposed control method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the motivation for and accomplishments to date in
   our ongoing effort to develop an integrated G-band SiGe radiometer for
   use in large-scale production of remote sensing CubeSats. The
   constrained nature of these platforms necessitates the use of highly

   production, assembly, and testing. The high speeds of emerging
   4th-generation SiGe BiCMOS technologies makes these platforms realistic
   targets for >100 GHz applications for the first time. The high
   integration level, fabrication economy-of-scale, low 1/f noise, built-in
   total-dose radiation tolerance, and attractive thermal properties of
   these technologies make them ideal for this application. Ultra-low noise
   SiGe LNA designs which show the potential of these technologies for use
   in high-quality radiometers are presented. Future designs will increase
   integration levels, with the ultimate goal being a full

Abstract = {{Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data has revolutionized the landslide
   assessment in a rugged vegetated terrain. It enables the
   parameterization of morphology and vegetation of the instability slopes.
   Vegetation characteristics are by far less investigated because of the
   currently available accuracy and density ALS data and paucity of field
   data validation. We utilized a high density ALS (HDALS) data with 170
   points m(-2) for characterizing disrupted vegetation induced by
   landslides by means of a variable window filter and the
   SkelTre-skeletonisation. Tree analyses in landslide areas resulted in
   relatively low height, small crown and more irregularities, whereas
   these peculiarities are not so obvious in the healthy forests. The
   statistical tests unveiled the clear differences between the extracted
   parameters in landslide and non-landslide zones and supported the field
   evidences. We concluded that HDALS is a promising tool to geometrically
   retrieve disrupted woody vegetation structures and can be good
   bioindicator to landslide activity.}},

Abstract = {{Broadband, continuous-wave, electromagnetic induction sensors have been
   shown to perform well, but they usually use more power than a pulsed
   induction sensor because of the power wasted in the linear amplifier
   used to drive the coils. Generally, much more power is dissipated in the
   power amplifier than in the coils in these systems. Methods for reducing
   this power are investigated using both linear and switched-mode
   amplifiers. Significant reductions in the power dissipated by the linear
   amplifier are achieved by optimizing the signal used to drive the coil.
   Much greater reductions are achieved with a switched-mode amplifier
   using an optimized signal that has most of its energy in the desired
   frequencies for the sensor. Both of these techniques are shown to
   perform well in a prototype system.}},

Abstract = {{THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD.
   Molecular communication between biological entities is a new paradigm in
   communications. Recently, we studied molecular communication between two
   nodes formed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior
   of bacteria, we used a population of them in each node. The reliability
   of such communication systems depends on both the maximum concentration
   of molecules that a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver
   node as well as the number of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum
   concentration of molecules falls with distance which makes the
   communication to the far nodes nearly impossible. In order to alleviate
   this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a molecular relaying
   node. The relay node can resend the message either by the different or
   the same type of molecules as the original signal from the transmitter.
   We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the relay
   node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the
   receiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the
   type of molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the
   range of concentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the
   effective number of bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of
   sense and forward relaying, we obtain the resulting improvement in
   channel capacity. We conclude that multi-type molecular relaying
   outperforms the single-type relaying. In the second scenario, we study
   the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary signaling scheme. We show
   that this relaying strategy increases the reliability of M-ary
   communication significantly.}},

   optimal coding rate, it is known that the encoder output is not uniform
   in variational distance, which yet might be desirable in some security
   schemes. In the case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
   sources, uniformity in divergence might be achieved if a uniformly
   distributed sequence, called seed, of length d(n) negligible compared to
   the message length n, is shared between the encoder and the decoder. We
   show that the optimal scaling of d(n) that jointly ensures an optimal
   coding rate and a uniform encoder output in divergence, is roughly on
   the order of root n. We also develop a near optimal achievability scheme
   using invertible extractors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a transformer-based quadrature generation scheme,
   which converts the RF input signal into the quadrature output signals.
   By employing multi-turn coil structure and new capacitive phase
   compensation on the through and coupling ports, the presented scheme can
   be implemented in a very compact footprint with high quality quadrature
   signal, making it feasible for cellular applications. Compared to
   conventional quadrature generation methods, this scheme provides
   low-loss, wide bandwidth, and most importantly robustness to process
   variations. As a proof-of-concept design example, we demonstrate a 2 GHz
   8-turn transformer-based quadrature generation block implemented in a
   standard 65 nm CMOS process. The whole design only occupies 280 mu m by
   280 mu m chip area. The detailed design parameters and the simulation
   results including quadrature balance, passive loss, input matching, and
   Monte-Carlo results under process variations are all presented.}},

Abstract = {{One way to gain a more comprehensive picture of the complex function of
   a cell is to study the transcriptome. A promising technology for
   studying the transcriptome is RNA sequencing, an application of which is
   to quantify elements in the transcriptome and to link quantitative
   observations to biology. Although numerous quantification algorithms are
   publicly available, no method of systematically assessing these
   algorithms has been developed. To meet the need for such an assessment,
   we present an approach that includes (1) simulated and real datasets,
   (2) three alignment strategies, and (3) six quantification algorithms.
   Examining the normalized root-mean-square error, the percentage error of
   the coefficient of variation, and the distribution of the coefficient of
   variation, we found that quantification algorithms with the input of
   sequence alignment reported in the transcriptomic coordinate usually
   performed better in terms of the multiple metrics proposed in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative transmission (CT), in which spatially separated wireless
   nodes collaborate to form a virtual antenna array or virtual
   multiple-input-single-output (VMISO) link, is an effective technique to
   enhance the system performance by spatial diversity. In this paper, we
   study the link asymmetry issue of the VMISO links between two
   neighboring CT clusters, which can be used to design higher-layer CT
   algorithms such as routing and medium access control (MAC). While many
   authors simplify analysis on CT-based networks with co-located
   approximation that ignores disparate path losses in VMISO links by
   assuming colocated cooperators, this paper studies the impact of
   disparate path losses on link asymmetry by allowing the relay locations
   to be random. We identify two main factors of the VMISO link asymmetry,
   which do not appear in the conventional SISObased networks: exclusive
   signal detection only at a single node and path-loss disparity. The link
   asymmetry level is evaluated by using the correlation and the ratio of
   two signal powers in the forward and reverse directions, which presents
   the distinct characteristics of the VMISO links compared to the
   conventional SISO links. Moreover, the simulation results show how the
   VMISO link asymmetry changes depending on various system parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed estimation algorithms in a large Wireless Sensor
   Network (WSN) with a star topology. The local estimates computed by each
   sensor must be collected in a fixed amount of time by the network's
   Fusion Center (FC) and processed to produce a global estimate. When the
   amount of time available is not sufficient to collect a local estimate
   from every node, a strategy that enables the most reliable estimates to
   be collected first must be developed. In this paper, we develop such an
   algorithm for a WSN whose FC uses a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator
   (BLUE) and collects the local estimates on a collision channel. The
   proposed schemes use population splitting that is based on the
   reliabilities of the local estimates. The time available for data
   collection is divided into frames and each frame is subdivided into
   slots. The slots in the first frame are used to collect the most
   reliable local estimates; the next frame of slots is used to collect the
   next most reliable set of local estimates; etc. As the performance of
   the schemes depends on the reliability thresholds, the number of bits
   representing the estimates, and the number of time slots in a frame, we
   formulate time-constrained optimization problems and derive methods to
   obtain the optimal values of these parameters. An interesting result
   shows that the optimal reliability thresholds do not maximize the
   channel's throughput.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors present for the first time a 94 GHz flip-chip

   The LNA is a custom design in a 0.13 mu m SiGe BiCMOS process, and
   features a four stage common-emitter topology. The measured on-wafer
   gain equals 17.2 dB and the noise figure is below 7 dB at 94 GHz with a
   3dB bandwidth of 18 GHz and a power consumption of 24 mW. For the
   packaging, the flip-chip technique is utilized on a flexible,
   light-weight LCP substrate material. Measured results show that the
   packaged LNA provides 15.9 dB gain (at the same power consumption), only
   1.3 dB lower than the on-wafer case. These results demonstrate the
   suitability of the LCP as a substrate material, and the low-loss

Abstract = {{Detection of buried radioactive objects faces challenges such as low
   energy counts and strong background clutters due to the burial of the
   targets. Classical detection methods such as the constrained energy
   minimization (CEM) and the RX method, when applied separately, may not
   be able to yield satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose to
   combine detection results from individual detectors through decision
   fusion, so that improved detection performance may be achieved. For a
   given data set, different detection methods are employed to yield binary
   decisions ({''}radiation{''} or ``non-radiation{''}) separately. Then
   the decisions are fused using majority voting. In addition, the scores
   generated from each detector (before yielding binary decisions) are also
   utilized to assist the fusion process. The proposed method is
   demonstrated to improve over the individual detectors using survey data
   collected on simulation targets.}},

   etched into the head region of the resonator to locally deposit
   chemically sensitive polymers by ink-jet printing. This permits the

   detecting mass loading and (b) are not strained during the in-plane
   vibrations of the resonator. As a result of the second point, even 5-mu
   m thick polymer coatings on resonators with a 9-12 mu m silicon
   thickness barely affect the Q-factor in air. This translates into higher
   frequency stability and ultimately higher sensor resolution compared to
   uniformly coated devices.}},

   are applied to the vicinity of the supporting post at the base of a
   hemispherical resonator, a region which has not been previously studied
   for this purpose. Our study shows the four-nodal point elliptical
   wineglass modes are highly sensitive to strain modifications around the

Abstract = {{The estimated covariance matrix is a building block for many algorithms,
   including signal and image processing. The Co-variance Method is an
   estimator for the covariance matrix, favored both as an estimator and in
   view of the convenient properties of the matrix that it produces.
   However, the considerable computational requirements limit its use. We
   present a novel computation algorithm for the covariance method, which
   dramatically reduces the computational complexity (both ALU operations
   and memory access) relative to previous algorithms. It has a small
   memory footprint, is highly parallelizable and requires no
   synchronization among compute threads. On a 40-core X86 system, we
   achieve 1200X speedup relative to a straightforward single-core
   implementation; even on a single core, 35X speedup is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse approximation is an optimization program that produces
   state-of-the-art results in many applications in signal processing and
   engineering. To deploy this approach in real-time, it is necessary to
   develop faster solvers than are currently available in digital. The
   Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) is a dynamical system designed to
   solve the class of sparse approximation problems in continuous time. But
   before implementing this network in analog VLSI, it is essential to
   provide performance guarantees. This paper presents new results on the
   convergence of the LCA neural network. Using recentlydeveloped methods
   that make use of the Lojasiewicz inequality for nonsmooth functions, we
   prove that the output and state trajectories converge to a single fixed
   point. This improves on previous results by guaranteeing convergence to
   a singleton even when the optimization program has infinitely many and
   nonisolated solution points.}},

Abstract = {{The leading problem of adopting caches into multicore computing systems
   is twofold: cache worsens execution time unpredictability (that
   challenges supporting real-time multimedia applications) and cache is
   power hungry (that challenges energy constraints). Recently published
   articles suggest that using cache locking improves timing
   predictability. However, increased cache activities due to aggressive
   cache locking make the system consume more energy and become less
   efficient. In this paper, we investigate the impact of multicore cache
   parameters and cache locking on performance and power consumption for
   real-time multimedia applications. We consider an Intel Xeon-like
   multicore architecture with two-level cache memory hierarchy and use two
   popular multimedia applications: recently introduced H.265/HEVC (for
   improved video quality and data compression ratio) and H.264/AVC (the
   network friendly video coding standard). Experimental results suggest
   that cache optimization has potential to improve multicore performance
   by decreasing cache miss rate down to 36\% and save power consumption up
   to 33\%. It is observed that H.265/HEVC has significant performance
   advantage on multicore system over H.264/AVC for smaller cache memories.}},

Abstract = {{The resonant characteristics of laterally vibrating rectangular
   hammerhead microcantilevers in viscous liquid media are investigated.
   The rectangular hammerhead microcantilever is modeled as an
   Euler-Bernoulli beam (stem) and a rigid body (head). A modified
   semi-analytical expression for the hydrodynamic function in terms of the
   Reynolds number, Re, and aspect ratio, h/b, is proposed to rapidly
   evaluate the sensing characteristics. Using this expression, the
   resonance frequency, quality factor and normalized surface mass
   sensitivity are investigated as a function of the dimensions of the
   microcantilever and liquid properties. Guidelines for design of
   hammerhead microcantilever geometry are proposed to achieve efficient
   sensing platforms for liquid-phase operation. The improvement in the
   sensing area and characteristics are expected to yield higher
   sensitivity of detection and improved signal-to-noise ratio in
   liquid-phase chemical sensing applications.}},

   steady-state waiting-time process for the M/M/1 queue with a server

   in-depth investigations of the underlying molecular and genetic
   mechanisms of disease progression. Biomaterials have also been utilized
   to improve cancer detection methods through the development of
   biomaterials-based contrast agents and molecular probes specific for
   cancer. Finally, biomaterials have made a significant impact in the
   development of therapeutics for cancer treatment. In this chapter, we

   challenge of information sharing and technical communication during the
   CBDM product development process. Specifically, we model a CBDM system
   as a socio-technical network. The research questions are: (1) What
   measures can be used to analyze the socio-technical network generated by
   CBDM? (2) How to detect communities/clusters and key actors in the
   socio-technical network? To answer these questions, a social network
   analysis (SNA) approach is formulated to analyze the socio-technical
   network generated by CBDM systems. The results indicate that SNA allows
   for visualizing collaborative relationship patterns of actors as well as
   detecting the community structure of CBDM systems.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic alloys of uranium show great potential as transmutation fuels
   that could be used to burn long-lived and high-heat-producing minor
   actinides and fission products in nuclear reactors. In fuels, fission
   and radiation damage result in the production of a large number of
   intrinsic point defects and extrinsic fission atoms. Radiation damage
   and diffusion (processes heavily dependent on point defects), as well as
   fission product behavior, are important to the understanding of the
   behavior of these metallic fuel alloys. Of the fission products, fission
   gases Xe, Kr, and the decay product He are of special importance, as
   they migrate and form bubbles detrimentally affecting fuel properties.
   In this work, several systems of body-centered-cubic (gamma) U are
   examined through a semi-empirical interatomic potential based on the
   modified embedded-atom method. The vacancy formation energy is analyzed
   as a function of pressure and is used to determine the stable vacancy
   formation energy at ambient conditions. The vacancy formation energy as
   a function of temperature is analyzed for high-temperature systems.
   Interatomic potentials are developed and implemented in the
   investigation of He, Xe, and Kr point defects in the gamma phase of
   uranium. For all fission gases studied, the most energetically favorable
   location is the substitutional position, with helium having the lowest
   formation energies of the species investigated.}},

Title = {{Differential transport function of lymphatic vessels in the rat tail
   model and the long-term effects of Indocyanine Green as assessed with
   near-infrared imaging}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Near-infrared (NIR) imaging has emerged as a novel imaging
   modality for assessing lymphatic function in vivo. While the technique
   has provided quantitative data previously unavailable, questions remain
   in regards to the spatiotemporal capabilities of the approach. We
   address three of the more important issues here using the rodent tail,
   one of the most widely utilized in vivo model systems in the lymphatic
   literature. Specifically we demonstrate (1) the transient vs. steady
   state response of lymphatics to tracer injection, (2) the functional
   characteristics of multiple collecting vessels draining the same tissue
   space in parallel, and (3) the long-term consequences of fluorescent
   tracers on lymphatic function to repeated functional measurements.
   Methods: Rat tails were imaged with NIR and metrics of function were
   calculated for both collecting vessels that drain the tail. A nitric
   oxide donor cream (GTNO) was applied to the tail. Additionally, two
   different NIR dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and LI-COR IRDye 800CW PEG,
   were utilized for function imaging at the time of initial injection and
   at 1, 2, and 4 week follow-up time points after which both draining
   lymph nodes were harvested.
   Results and Discussion: Significant differences were found between the
   two collecting vessels such that the vessel first showing fluorescence
   (dominant) produced enhanced functional metrics compared to the second
   vessel (non-dominant). GTNO significantly reduced lymphatic function in
   the non-dominant vessel compared to the dominant. ICG remained visible
   in the tail for 2 weeks after injection and was accompanied by
   significant losses in lymphatic function and enlarged draining lymph
   nodes. The Licor tracer also remained visible for 2 weeks. However, the
   dye produced significantly lower effects on lymphatic function than ICG,
   and lymph nodes were not enlarged at any time point, suggesting that
   this may be a more appropriate contrast agent for longitudinal lymphatic
   imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitance-voltage (C-V) response of III-V MOS devices has been a
   subject of increased research and debate over the past decade. Attempts
   to correlate chemical states to the observed electrical response in
   addition to simulation and modeling have led to great advances in the
   understanding of these systems. Here, we present our observations on the
   electrical and physical characteristics of III-V based devices. The C-V
   response is fundamentally different than that of Si-based devices owing
   to the tunneling of charge carriers into distributed trap states. Our
   investigations suggest that these trap states are caused by a disordered
   chemical region associated with the III-V semiconductor (Disorder
   Induced Gap States, DIGS) and not due to defects in the high-k
   dielectric (border traps).}},

Abstract = {{The retreating blades of rotorcraft operated at high advance ratios will
   experience reverse flow through a sector encompassing a wide range of
   blade azimuth angles. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the blade
   aerodynamic loads under these conditions. This is a limiting factor when
   trying to improve the flight speed envelope of helicopters. Previous
   studies and work have used two-dimensional aerodynamic approaches for
   the reverse flow area, making the assumption that aerodynamic forces
   behave similar in magnitude but opposite in direction. There have been
   no 3-dimensional considerations being taken into account nor was vortex
   induced lift considered. We hypothesize that the reverse blade flow
   field includes phenomena similar to the formation of a leading edge
   vortex on highly-swept, sharp-edges delta wings. An approach is being
   developed to understand aerodynamic contributions to blade loading
   beyond linear theory, where vortex-induced lift might be significant.
   Rotor blades at highly yawed angles relative to the wind can be thought
   of as very low aspect ratio wings. Since reverse airfoils are thought of
   as sharp edges, theoretically it should stand that a reverse finite wing
   at high yawed angles could be considered as a slender delta wing. The
   main aim of this work is to progress towards testing this above
   hypothesis. Experimental data is collected from a scaled version of a
   rotor blade exposed to the reverse flow at various azimuth positions
   representing the retreating side of the disc, in a 1.07mx1.07m low
   turbulence wind tunnel.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic-dynamic interaction of a load slung from a helicopter in
   flight can lead to divergent oscillations. In this paper; interactions
   between degrees of freedom are explored through fundamental simulation
   and wind tunnel experiments of generic shapes. Video analysis of the
   behavior of loads in a wind tunnel provides insights into dynamic
   behavior, and reveals the difference in behavior of the same model
   between wind tunnels of different sizes. A compound pendulum motion in a
   plane orthogonal to a steady freestream is first studied. Even with
   proximate walls, a purely symmetric single degree of freedom.
   oscillation does not amplify. The addition of an out-of-phase force as a
   simplified model for yaw effects, leads to amplification or damping
   under some conditions. Wall effects amplify this interaction further
   This level of simulation enables guidance to develop metrics for
   unsteady wall interference in dynamic testing. Results to-date set the
   context for future work in refining the aerodynamic and dynamic models,
   including tether and vehicle dynamics. Incorporation of quasi-steady and
   unsteady loads data from wind tunnel measurements and computational
   fluid dynamics would enable prediction of the linear superposition stage
   leading towards divergence. Comparison of simulaiton results to measured
   parameters from wind tunnel experiments shows relative agreement.}},

   explored in this work via a plane-strain elastostatic analysis. A rigid
   pin of prescribed geometry is placed in contact with an elastic slab and
   translated horizontally under conditions of constant load. An intrinsic
   static coefficient of friction is prescribed, which limits the ratio of
   shear stress to contact pressure at each location within the interface.
   Additionally, the surface of the elastic slab is given a desired
   undulation to simulate the effects of surface roughness. As the pin is
   translated horizontally, a lateral reaction force (i.e., friction force)
   is developed and is observed to grow nearly linearly with increasing
   lateral displacement. At a critical point, a substantial portion of the
   interface experiences slip, leading to a large decrease in the friction
   force and thereby revealing a stick-slip behavior. It is found that the
   overall (macroscopic) static friction coefficient can be significantly
   less than the intrinsic friction coefficient and that the presence of
   even a small amount of roughness can have a large effect on the friction
   force.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of charging electric vehicles(EV) while they are
   cruising on highways is explored. Such a technology would break through
   the `range anxiety' barrier to mass adoption of EVs. Developments in
   emerging energy technologies for automotive radar and other
   applications, have made possible the implementation of wireless
   millimeter wave beamed power. The rapid advances in the ability to
   accurately beam and receive power in the 70 to 225 GHz frequency range
   using solid state components suggests that it will become possible in
   the near future to beam sufficient power to perform such charging
   applications. Unlike short-range wireless inductive charging, beamed
   cruise charging is aimed to work on vehicles traveling as fast as 100
   kph on straight segments of the highway, similar to cruise toll lanes
   used today. Subsequent versions may use aerostats or towers to beam
   power, enabling power delivery on curved roads in mountainous regions.
   The paper will survey related prior work and set out preliminary sizing
   and business case calculations, followed in the final paper by trade
   studies to perform a first level optimization. We also discuss the
   architectural requirements, charging rates and perform a sustainability}},

Abstract = {{Photostrictive materials are lanthanum-modified lead zirconatetitanate
   (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti) O-3 ceramics doped with WO3, called PLZT, exhibit large
   photostriction under uniform illumination of high-energy light.
   Photostrictive materials are ferrodielectric ceramics that have a
   photostrictive effect. Photostriction arises from a superposition of the
   photovoltaic effect, i.e. the generation of large voltage from the
   irradiation of light, and the converse-piezoelectric effect, i.e.
   expansion or contraction under the voltage applied. Photostrictive
   materials offer the potential for actuators with many advantages over
   traditional transducing electromechanical actuators made of shape memory
   alloys and electroceramics (piezoelectric and electrostrictive).
   Drawback of traditional actuators is that they require hard-wired
   connections to transmit the control signals which introduce electrical
   noise into the control signals; on the other hand PLZT actuators offer
   non-contact actuation, remote control, and are immune from
   electric/magnetic disturbances.
   The main goal of the research work is to investigate the feasibility of
   utilizing photostrictive materials as an optical actuator for
   Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) applications. In this
   investigation process both experimental and computational approaches
   have been implemented. In the experimental part of this research, a test
   set-up has been designed and developed to measure the photostriction
   effect of a PLZT thin film on a silicon wafer as smart beams. The
   experimental set-up includes high pressure short arc xenon lamp with
   lamp housing, power supply, lamp igniter, hot mirror, band pass filters,
   optical chopper, and laser sensor with sensor head and controller.1 mu m
   PLZT thin film on the silicon wafer sample has been tested as a
   cantilever beam with different light intensities, and focusing the light
   at the different locations on the PLZT cantilever beam. The experiment
   has been performed for continuous and pulses of lights focusing on the
   PLZT optical actuator. An optical chopper was used to make pulses of
   light on the PLZT cantilever beam. Also, a computational finite element
   method useful for design of systems incorporating thin film
   photostrictive actuators has already been developed by the authors. The
   element has been implemented in an in-house finite element code. This
   derived finite element for continuous illumination of light on the
   photostrictive thin film has been used to investigate the application of
   photostrictive actuators for the different structures and various
   boundary conditions of microbeams with various actuator locations and
   length intensities. A successful conclusion of these tasks will affirm
   the potential of the PLZT optical actuator to use in the MEMS devices.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) yield system level
   performance improvements by providing high-bandwidth communication as
   well as opportunity for heterogeneous integration. It is envisioned that
   an area array of 3D stacked ICs can be interconnected using dense
   fine-pitch electrical and photonic interconnects on a silicon
   interposer. This paper presents a mechanically robust ``thick{''}
   silicon interposer with novel electrical through-silicon vias (TSVs) and
   optical TSVs. The novel electrical TSVs described include polymer-clad
   TSVs and polymer-embedded vias. An advantage of using thick silicon
   interposer is that microchannels can be integrated in the thick silicon
   interposer to transfer a coolant to the 3D ICs with interlayer
   microfluidic heat sink or for the direct integration of a microfluidic
   heat-sink in the silicon interposer. However, as the thickness of
   silicon interposer increases, TSV electrical parasitics increase.
   Moreover, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between
   the copper TSV and silicon causes reliability issues. To reduce TSV
   capacitance as well as to reduce TSV stresses, polymer-clad electrical
   TSVs were fabricated. Using the same photodefinable polymer used for the
   cladding of electrical TSVs, optical TSVs were fabricated and

Abstract = {{Thermal transport in microelectronic devices spans length scales from
   tens of nanometers to hundreds of millimeters. One of the major
   challenges in maintaining quality and reliability in today's
   microelectronic devices comes from the ever increasing level of
   integration in the device fabrication as well as the high level of
   current densities that are carried through the microchip during
   operation. Consequently, significant opportunities for energy efficiency
   exist at various levels of the length scale hierarchy by optimization of
   thermal management resources.
   In this study, we developed a computationally efficient and accurate
   multi-scale reduced order transient thermal methodology consisting of
   hybrid implementation of two different multi-scale approaches: 1.
   ``Progressive Zoom-in{''} method and 2. ``Proper Orthogonal
   Decomposition (POD){''} technique. The suggested approach provides the
   ability to predict different thermal scenarios based on one
   representative thermal scenario, while maintaining the desired spatial
   and temporal accuracy. In this paper, a Flip Chip Ball Grid Array
   (FCBGA) package was considered for hybrid modeling. To demonstrate the
   capability of POD method in predicting different thermal scenarios, the
   chip is divided into ten function blocks. Each of these blocks had a
   different randomly generated dynamic power source. To validate this
   methodology, the results were compared with a finite element (FE) model
   developed in COMSOL(R). The behavior of the POD model was in good
   agreements with the corresponding FE model. This close correlation
   provides the capability of predicting other thermal scenarios based on a
   smaller sample set which can significantly decrease the computational
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) stacking is an emerging trend for future high
   performance microsystems. The stacking of chips increases the power
   density significantly, with associated thermal concerns. For interior
   tiers in a 3D stack, the surface area for the heat removal is further
   reduced. Also, realistic power maps on active tiers produce highly
   non-uniform patterns, with maximum heat fluxes 5-10 times the average
   values. Conventional air-cooled heat sinks cannot meet these thermal
   requirements. In this paper, a compact thermal model of a multi-layer
   chip stack subjected to the realistic power map was developed. Inter
   layer pin fins were modeled on the back of the chips, with water as the
   coolant. It was found that the compact model ran ten times faster than
   the full computational fluid dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) model, with
   errors within 5\%. The compact model was then used to analyze the
   thermal characteristics of 4 layer stacked dual core Penryn
   microprocessors, with a total power of 172.4 W. The non-uniform power
   map produced maximum heat flux of 300 W/cm(2) in the hot spots. The
   results show that at a pressure drop of 20 kPa and inlet water
   temperature of 20 degrees C, the temperature of the bottom tier is
   higher than the other three tiers and the maximum temperature of the
   bottom layer is 56 degrees C. This is because the bottom layer thermal
   management only depends on one-sided pin fin cooling, while the other
   layers have double-sided cooling. A dual pass channel configuration
   reduced the maximum temperature to 50 degrees C. Overall, the interlayer
   pin fin cooling was found to be a very effective thermal management
   method for 3D stacked die packaging.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can significantly improve the net power
   consumption and battery life of the mobile devices or high performance
   devices by generating power from the waste heat of these devices. Recent
   advancements show that the ultrathin thermoelectric devices can be
   fabricated and integrated within a microelectronic package. This paper
   first investigates the power generation by a single ultrathin TEG
   embedded within a micro-electronic package considering several key
   factors such as load resistance, chip heat flux, and proximity of the
   TEG to chip. We observe that the power generation from TEGs increases
   with increasing background heat flux on chip or when TEGs are moved
   closer to the chip. After the investigation of a single TEG, an array of
   embedded TEGs is considered in order to analyze the influence of
   multiple TEGs on total power generation and conversion efficiency.
   Increasing the number of TEGs from one to nine increase the useful power
   generation from 72.9 mW to 378.4 mW but decreases the average conversion
   efficiency from 0.47\% to 0.32\%. This suggests that average power
   generated per TEG gradually decrease from 72.9 mW to 42.0 mW when number
   of TEGs is increased from one to nine. However; the total useful power
   generated using nine TEGs is significant and emphasize the benefits of
   using embedded TEGs to reduce net power consumption in electronics

Abstract = {{Effective air flow distribution through perforated tiles is required to
   efficiently cool servers in a raised floor data center. We present
   detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of air flow through
   a perforated tile and its entrance to the adjacent server rack. The
   realistic geometrical details of the perforated tile, as well as of the
   rack are included in the model. Generally models for air flow through
   perforated tiles specify a step pressure loss across the tile surface,
   or porous jump model based on the tile porosity. An improvement to this
   includes a momentum source specification above the tile to simulate the
   acceleration of the air flow through the pores, or body force model. In
   both of these models geometrical details of tile such as pore locations
   and shapes are not included. More details increase the grid size as well
   as the computational time. However, the grid refinement can be
   controlled to achieve balance between the accuracy and computational
   time. We compared the results from CFD using geometrical resolution with
   the porous jump and body force model solution as well as with the
   measured flow field using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments.
   We observe that including tile geometrical details gives better results
   as compared to elimination of tile geometrical details and specifying
   physical models across and above the tile surface. A modification to the
   body force model is also suggested and improved results were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we utilize electron-phonon Monte Carlo simulations of
   AlGaN/GaN HEMTs to determine the energy loss rate of electrons in the
   channel of the transistor as a function of bias conditions. Intense
   energy transfer from electrons to phonons is observed near the gate edge
   on the drain side of such devices where the peak electric, field exists.
   This intense energy exchange results in nanometer sized hotspots in the
   vicinity of the gate edge. In order to account for effects of ballistic
   phonon transport on temperature near the hotspots, a non-gray Discrete
   Ordinates Method (DOM) is used as a numerical solver for the phonon
   Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). The non-gray model accounts for
   dispersion effects of GaN by splitting the dispersion curve of GaN into
   a finite number of frequency bands. The phonons in each frequency band
   are assumed to have the same properties with the other phonons in the
   same band and the relaxation times between these bands are calculated.
   The results show how energy is redistributed among the available phonon
   bands and demonstrates which modes are most effective at transporting
   the thermal energy. Finally, the hotspot temperature predictions
   obtained by the model are compared to temperatures obtained by gray and
   continuum modeling approaches to show the discrepancies between
   different techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured materials are a relatively new class of materials that
   exhibit advanced mechanical properties, thus improving performance and
   capabilities of products, with potential applications in the automotive,
   aerospace and defense industries. Among the severe plastic deformation
   (SPD) methods currently used for achieving nanoscale structures,
   accumulative roll bonding (ARB) is the most favorable method to produce
   grain refinement for continuous production of metallic sheets at a bulk
   scale.
   In this article, a model that describes the evolution of material
   strength due to processing via accumulative roll bonding was developed.
   ARB experiments were conducted on CP-Ti Grade 2 at a selected set of
   conditions. The results showed significant grain refinement in the
   microstructure (down to similar to 120 nm) and a two-fold increase in
   tensile strength as compared to the as-received material. The developed
   model was validated using the experimental data, and exhibited a good
   fit over the entire range of ARB processing cycles. To further validate
   the model and ensure its robustness for a wider array of materials
   (beyond CP-Ti), a review of efforts on ARB processing was carried out
   for five other materials with different initial microstructures,
   mechanical properties, and even crystalline structures. The model was
   still able to capture the strengthening trends in all considered
   materials. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{A 1-D macro-homogeneous model of the PEMFC is presented with the ability
   to simulate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The model is
   shown to reproduce the inductive loop seen at low frequencies at
   moderate to high current densities. Based on the model, this feature of
   EIS can be assigned to modulation of membrane conductivity due to water
   buildup. In addition, the model is compared to experimental polarization
   data and EIS at low oxygen concentrations to evaluate the oxygen
   reduction reaction kinetics at high overpotential and oxygen transport
   limitations under non-condensing conditions. The results suggest that a
   lower reaction order and dual Tafel slope may be necessary to best
   describe experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations in the field of nanotechnology have potential to improve
   industrial productivity and performance. One promising applications of
   this emerging technology is using nanofluids with enhanced thermal
   properties. Nanofluids, engineered colloidal suspensions consisting of
   nano-sized particles (less than 100nm) dispersed in a basefluid, have
   shown potential as industrial cooling fluids due to the enhanced heat
   transfer characteristics. Experiments are conducted to compare the
   overall heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop of water vs.
   nanofluids in a laboratory scale industrial type shell and tube heat
   exchanger. Three mass particle concentrations, 2\%, 4\% and 6\%, of
   SiO2-water nanofluids are formulated by dispersing 20 nm diameter nano
   particles in desalinated water. Nanofluid and tap water are then
   circulated in the cold and hot loops, respectively, of the heat
   exchanger to avoid direct particle deposition on heater surfaces.
   Interestingly, experimental result show both augmentation and
   deterioration of heat transfer coefficient for nanofluids depending on
   the flow rate through the heat exchangers. This trend is consistent with
   an earlier reported observation for heat transfer in micro channels.
   This trend may be explained by the counter effect of the changes in
   thermo-physical properties of fluids together with the fouling on the
   heat exchanger surfaces. The measured pressure drop in the nanofluids
   flow shows an increase when compared to that of basefluid that could
   limit the use of nanofluids in heat exchangers for industrial
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in
   various critical domains like health care, critical infrastructure, and
   climate monitoring, where application builders have diversified
   development needs. Independent of the functionalities provided by the
   WSN applications, many of the developers use visualization, simulation,
   and programming tools. However, these tools are designed as separate
   stand-alone applications, which force developers to use multiple tools.
   This situation often poses confusion and hampers an efficient
   development experience. To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools,
   we have designed a new extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and
   open-source framework called PROVIZ, which is an integrated
   visualization and programming framework. In this paper, we explain the
   various features of PROVIZ's visualization and programming framework and
   discuss how PROVIZ can be used as a visual debugging tool to aid in
   providing a software fix.}},

   (ICAs) containing Metallized Polymer Spheres (MPS) with a diameter of 30
   mu m and 115 mu m as conductive fillers have been investigated, denoted
   ICA-30 mu m and ICA-15 mu m, respectively. The MPS are coated with an
   approximately 150 rim thick layer of Ag. The coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) below Tg for ICA-30 mu m and ICA-15 mu m was found to be
   50 ppm/degrees C and 53 ppm/degrees C, respectively. DMA measurements
   show a relatively large increase in loss modulus when 30 mu m MPS are
   added to the epoxy matrix. The thermal conductivity with different
   volume fillings of MPS for both ICA-30 mu m and ICA-15 mu m has been
   investigated. Thermal conductivity of the ICA was modeled by using the
   Pal model for core-shell particles with reasonable accuracy especially
   at lower volume fillings. A thermal conductivity of 1 W/mK can be
   achieved by using approximately 1.4 vol\% of silver. Using ICA with
   conventional silver flakes/particles, approximately 16 vol\% of silver
   has to be used to achieve the corresponding thermal conductivity, which
   clearly illustrates the cost benefits of using ICA with MPS.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of optimising contact tank design through numerical model
   simulations, results are presented herein of an experimental and
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study in a scaled laboratory model.
   Three-dimensional numerical simulations of flow and transport
   characteristics were conducted using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes
   equation approach. Experimental results were obtained through Acoustic
   Doppler Velocimetry measurements and a series of conservative tracer
   experiments. Focus is given on turbulent structures and undesirable flow
   patterns that lead to a reduced disinfection efficiency, through
   phenomena such as short circuiting and recirculation zones. The
   laboratory data analysis indicates extensive three-dimensionality as a
   result of the current inlet geometry with a confirmed negative impact on
   the disinfection performance of the contact tank model, as demonstrated
   by Residence Time Distribution curves. Disinfection performance is
   evaluated through hydraulic efficiency indicators commonly used in the
   industry to monitor field-scale disinfection facilities. Correlations
   between CFD and experimental data confirm the adequate reproduction of
   hydrodynamic conditions and reinforce the predictive capabilities of
   numerical models as tools to simulate field scale tanks or optimize
   existing designs.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of wave climate, extreme ocean events, turbulence, and the
   energy dissipation of breaking and non-breaking waves are closely
   related to the measurements of the ocean surface. To gauge and analyze
   ocean waves on a computer, we reconstruct their 3-D model by utilizing
   the concepts of stereoscopic reconstruction and variational
   optimization. This technique requires a pair of calibrated cameras
   cameras whose parameters are estimated for the mathematical projection
   model from space to an image plane to take videos of the ocean surface
   as input. However, the accuracy of camera parameters, including the
   orientations and the positions of cameras as well as the internal
   specifications of optics elements, are subject to environmental factors
   and manual calibration errors. Because the errors of camera parameters
   magnify the errors of the 3-D reconstruction after projection, we
   propose a novel algorithm that refines camera parameters, thereby
   improving the accuracy of variational 3-D reconstruction. We design a
   multivariate error function that represents discrepancies between
   captured images and the re-projection of the reconstruction onto the
   images. As a result of the iteratively diminished error function, the
   camera parameters and the reconstruction of ocean waves evolve to
   optimal values. We demonstrate the success of our algorithm by comparing
   the reconstruction results with the refinement procedure to those
   without it and show improvements in the statistics and spectrum of the
   wave reconstruction after the refinement procedure.}},

   vision systems has focused on investigating sea states with wavelengths
   in the range of 0.01 in to 1 m. In this work, we present two modern
   stereo variational approaches, viz, the disparity and graph methods, for
   the estimation of the ocean surface displacements over larger spatial
   scales of 10 to 100 m. The disparity method estimates the disparity
   between images as an intermediate step toward retrieving the depth of
   the waves with respect to the cameras, and the graph method estimates
   the ocean surface displacements directly in 3-D space. The pros and cons
   of both methods are compared and their performance is evaluated using
   experimental video data collected at an offshore platform in the Black

Abstract = {{A new variant of the hot embossing process has been conducted with
   amorphous PEEK films as a model material. Constant Temperature Embossing
   (CTE) utilizes the crystallizing nature of amorphous polymers such as
   poly (ether ether ketone) (PEEK), poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
   and poly (ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) when heated above their glass
   transition temperature to eliminate the thermal cycling. The key process
   parameters such as embossing temperature and embossing time depend on
   the thermal behavior of the amorphous PEEK film. Embossing studies were
   conducted using silicon tools with microchannel arrays of different
   aspect ratios, and the films were characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy and optical profilometry. The process enables a simple
   isothermal embossing process for polymers that have a glass transition
   temperature well above the room temperature and also with a wide
   temperature gap between the glass transition temperature and melting
   point.}},

Abstract = {{Passive, heat actuated devices can offer simple and energy-efficient
   options for a variety of end uses. An ejector pump is one such device
   that provides reasonable pressure head with no electrical input or
   moving parts. Useful for a wide range of applications from nuclear
   reactor cooling to vapor compression in waste-heat-driven heat pumping
   and work recovery systems, the flow phenomena inside an ejector must be
   understood to achieve improvements in component design and efficiency.
   In an effort to obtain insights into the flow phenomena inside an
   ejector, and to evaluate the effectiveness of commonly used
   computational tools in predicting these conditions, this study presents
   a set of shadowgraph images of flow inside a large-scale air ejector,
   and compares them to computational simulations of the same flow.
   On-design and off-design conditions are considered where the suction
   flow is choked and not choked, respectively. The computational
   simulations used for comparison apply k-epsilon RNG and k-omega SST
   turbulence models available in ANSYS FLUENT to 2D, locally-refined
   rectangular meshes for ideal gas air flow. Experimental and
   computational results show that on-design ejector operation is predicted
   with reasonable accuracy, but accuracy with the same models is not
   adequate at off-design conditions. This is attributed to an inability of
   turbulence models to predict shock/expansion interaction with the motive
   jet boundary, as well as the strength and position of flow features.
   Exploration of local flow features shows that the k-co SST model
   predicts the location of flow features, as well as global inlet mass
   flow rates, with greater accuracy. It is concluded that to provide a
   rigorous validation of turbulence models for the application of modeling
   ejector flow, it is necessary to rely on off-design data where more
   complex phenomena occur, such as flow separation, strong boundary
   layer/shock interaction, and unsteady flow. Such validation will help
   refine turbulence models for future ejector design purposes, and allow
   for more efficient ejector operation.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, raised floor data centers operate using controllers that
   only maintain constant data center space conditions (i.e. supply air
   temperatures or return air temperatures) at the Computer Room Air
   Conditioning (CRAC) Unit level with the intention of providing enough
   cooling for the servers. The objective of this paper is to explore the
   framework required to design a controller that regulates server CPU
   temperatures by specifying the supply air temperature of the CRAC. The
   controller will be an addition to the existing controller used by the
   CRAC to regulate supply air temperatures. In the discrete-time domain,
   implementation and the performance of the modified integral action
   controller is analyzed and other important parameters are compared. As a
   preliminary attempt, the controller will be designed for a standard 44U
   cabinet with 42 ``1U{''} servers, where the machines will execute a
   prescribed compute load variation: (1) step increase in all compute
   loads and (2) scaled down representation for a rack of servers using
   utilization trends from one of Google's data centers. Ultimately, the
   development of this controller is motivated by the growing interest in
   Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) where the IT level and
   facility level information are both used to intelligently plan and

   of the annulus, and the stagnation point of the vortex breakdown region.
   This paper discusses the flame and flow topologies that exist in these
   flows. These results illustrate the importance of the sensitivity of
   flame configurations to geometric (such as centerbody size and shape,
   combustor diameter, exhaust contraction) and operational (e.g., bulkhead
   temperature, preheat temperature, fuel air ratio) parameters. We
   particularly emphasize the centerbody shape as differentiating between
   two different families of flame shapes. Results are shown illustrating
   the time averaged and instantaneous flame shape and flow fields, using
   high speed PIV, OH-PLIF, and luminosity imaging.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first of two parts, and describes measurements of the
   response of a transversely forced, single nozzle, swirling flame. This
   study is motivated by combustion instabilities coupling with azimuthal
   combustor modes. Two different forcing configurations are applied, where
   the flame/nozzle are located at a pressure node and anti-node,
   respectively. High speed velocimetry and chemiluminescence measurements
   were made of the forced and unforced flow in multiple orthogonal planes,
   revealing both the axial and azimuthal development of the unsteady flow.
   Spectra and azimuthal mode decompositions of these data show the
   dominance of the m=1 helical mode in the unforced flow. Depending upon
   the nature of the forcing, the flow response at the forcing frequency
   can be dominated by the axisymmetric, m=0 mode, or the m=1 mode. These
   results clearly show that the dominant fluid mechanic structures
   exciting flames during transverse instabilities varies from nozzle to
   nozzle, depending upon the phase characteristics of the acoustic
   excitation field. Part II of this paper uses these time averaged and
   fluctuating measurements as inputs to a flame response model of the
   unsteady global heat release fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many studies in the past which have evaluated the
   potential fuel savings benefits of various engine technologies applied
   simultaneously to a gas turbine engine. Coupled with the inclusion of
   new engine technology is almost always a change to the engine cycle
   design in order to maximize the full benefits of the technology. Current
   research focuses on the trends in benefits due to potential technologies
   and cycle design changes and identifies which specific technology areas
   can be targeted to reduce risk relative to meeting performance goals.
   The results are used to identify high priority technologies that
   increase the chances of meeting performance metrics. Such investigations
   can add value to government and industry entities that are engaging in
   aviation technology development programs attempting to simultaneously
   meet reduction goals for noise and fuel burn.
   Jet and fan noise are primary sources of noise on current engine
   architectures. Noise suppression technologies can be applied to current
   engine designs to suppress sources of noise thereby reducing the noise
   impact of the engine. Similarly, the engine cycle can be changed to
   reduce noise and fuel burn. The critical link is that feasible engine
   cycles are tightly coupled to the subsystem technologies applied to
   various engine components. This leads to two critical questions. First,
   what part of the engine cycle is key to simultaneously meeting noise and
   fuel burn goals? This inevitably leads to one of three areas, the
   propulsor (BPR), the core (OPR), or the transmission mechanism between
   the core and propulsor. The other question is: which subsystem
   technologies are crucial to achieve the necessary core, propulsor, or
   power transmission improvements?
   To answer these questions, this study examines and quantifies the
   potential benefits in technologies developed for both noise source
   reduction and thermal / propulsive efficiency increases. Trade studies
   on the potential impacts of each of the technologies are performed to
   capture the sensitivity on fuel burn and noise from changes to assumed
   benefits of the engine cycle and applied subsystem technologies. It will
   be demonstrated that a geared transmission is the primary enabler to
   simultaneously meeting performance goals. Should the geared transmission
   fall short, other areas of improvement simply cannot overcome the
   shortfall in fuel burn and noise.}},

Abstract = {{There are currently numerous government and industry entities engaging
   in aviation technology development programs {[}1,2,3]. Due to the number
   of technologies being investigated there exists an understandable desire
   to rank technologies in order to identify the most beneficial ones.
   Historically, this has been done through the use of ``waterfall{''} or
   technology stack-up charts {[}4].One purpose of such waterfall charts is
   to show the amount of benefit each technology provides to the integrated
   system. This approach is valid, and extremely useful, for verifying the
   modeling of such technologies; however, there are shortcomings in using
   a waterfall chart to assess the relative contribution of individual
   technologies to the overall system level benefit. This is due to several
   considerations that are not taken into account when developing
   conventional technology ranking charts. For example, the relative impact
   of each technology can be highly dependent on the order in which
   technologies are applied, the system the technology is applied to, the
   relative design changes that occur either before or after the technology
   is applied, and other technologies that are present on the system. In
   order to explore these characteristics this paper uses propulsion
   technologies since there are strong interactions between the various
   components of an engine. Engine technologies also commonly rely upon
   enabling technologies which provide less benefit, but without them the
   larger ``bigger hitting{''} technologies are not feasible.
   This research explores and quantifies the issues associated with several
   conventional methods of creating technology ranking charts. Propulsion
   technologies targeting both thermal and propulsive efficiency are
   applied to a baseline aircraft and engine configuration. Several
   conventional technology ranking and stack-up techniques are applied in
   order to evaluate how the relative impacts of individual technologies
   vary greatly depending on the assessment method. In all cases the same
   technology packages are applied such that the final benefit is the same,
   regardless of ranking method. It is suggested that a range of currently
   used ranking techniques all used to determine a more robust estimate of
   the impact.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that there are advantages in moving towards
   non-pneumatic engine secondary systems. Such systems are used primarily
   to provide pressurization, cabin climate control, and de-icing; however,
   as bypass ratios continue to grow and engine cores become more
   efficient, the engine fan diameter is increased and core size is
   diminished. As a consequence, pneumatic off-takes require a larger
   percentage of the core flow leading to larger performance penalties. One
   current solution is to drive the aircraft environmental control systems
   (ECS) with large engine driven electric compressors rather than to use
   high pressure air from the core. Since cores are generally less
   sensitive to electrical power off-takes than to pneumatic off-takes this
   results in a smaller performance penalty. {[}1] Using electrical air
   compressors also ensures fresh, clean air is delivered to the ECS
   thereby eliminating the risk of engine bleed contaminated cabin air.
   This research uses the Environmental Design Space (EDS) to examine the
   feasibility of recovering engine core exhaust heat to perform useful
   work within the aircraft. EDS serves to capture interdependencies at the
   conceptual design level of fuel burn, emissions, and noise for
   conventional and advanced engine and airframe architectures {[}2].
   Recovering exhaust heat is accomplished through a novel concept that
   makes use of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC).The concept is similar in
   principle to heat recovery steam generators used in power plant
   applications to improve combined cycle efficiency {[}3]. The main
   difference is the ORC system is relatively lightweight and appropriate
   for use onboard an aircraft. The waste heat in this application is used
   to generate electricity to drive external air compressors to supply flow
   to the ECS. As a result pneumatic bleeds within the engine can be
   eliminated, thereby eliminating growing performance penalties associated
   with shrinking core size and increased fan diameters. An ORC is
   considered because ORC cycles are ideal for extracting low grade heat.
   As an additional benefit the ORC vapor cycle can use the fan inlet and
   wing leading edge anti-ice devices as a condensation heat transfer
   mechanism that could also allow the system to provide anti-icing
   capabilities, further reducing engine pneumatic off-takes. The current
   research focuses on the system as applied the ORC concept to a CFM56
   sized engine and has analytically demonstrated from a 0.9\% to a 2.5\%
   benefit in vehicle fuel burn relative to a conventional, pneumatically
   driven ECS. Actual fuel burn savings are dependent on the net
   installation weight of the ORC cycle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for developing a control oriented
   analytical linear model of a turbofan engine at both equilibrium and
   non-equilibrium conditions. This scheme provides improved accuracy over
   the commonly used linearization method based on numerical perturbation.
   Linear coefficients are obtained by evaluating at current conditions
   analytical expressions which result from differentiation of simplified
   nonlinear expressions. Residualization of the fast dynamics states are
   utilized since the fast dynamics are outside of the primary control
   bandwidth. Analytical expressions based on the physics of the
   aerothermodynamic processes of a gas turbine engine facilitate a
   systematic approach to the analysis and synthesis of model based
   controllers. In addition, the use of analytical expressions reduces the
   computational effort, enabling linearization in real time at both
   equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions to enable more accurate
   capture of system dynamics during aggressive transient maneuvers. The
   methodology is formulated and applied to a separate flow twin spool
   turbofan engine model in the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation
   (NPSS) platform. The derived linear model is validated against the full

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to establish a condition monitoring regimen
   capable of diagnosing the depth and location of a transverse fatigue
   crack in a rotordynamic system. The success of an on-line crack
   diagnosis regimen hinges on the accuracy of the crack model used. The
   model should account for the depth of the crack and the localization of
   the crack along the shaft. Negating the influence of crack location on
   system response ignores a crucial component of real cracks. Two gaping
   crack models are presented; the first simulates a finite-width
   manufactured notch, while the second models an open fatigue crack. An
   overhung rotordynamic system is modeled, imitating an available
   rotordynamic test rig. Four degree-of-freedom equations of motion for
   both crack models are presented and discussed, along with corresponding
   transfer matrix techniques. Free and forced response analyses are
   performed, with emphasis placed on results applicable to condition
   monitoring. It is demonstrated that two identifiers are necessary to
   diagnose the crack parameters: the 2X resonance frequency and the
   magnitude of the 2X component of the rotor angular response at
   resonance. First, a contour plot of the 2X resonant shaft speed versus
   crack depth and location is generated. The magnitude of the 2X component
   of the rotor's angular response along the desired contour is obtained,
   narrowing the possible pairs of crack location/depth to either one or
   two possibilities. Practical aspects of the diagnosis procedure are then
   discussed.}},
