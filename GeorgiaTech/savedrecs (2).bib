Abstract = {{The development of practical and effective gas-solid contactors is an
   important area in the development of CO2 capture technologies. Target
   CO2 capture applications, such as post-combustion carbon capture and
   sequestration (CCS) from power plant flue gases or CO2 extraction
   directly from ambient air (DAC), require high flow rates of gas to be
   processed at low cost. Extruded monolithic honeycomb structures, such as
   those employed in the catalytic converters of automobiles, have
   excellent potential as structured contactors for CO2 adsorption
   applications because of the low pressure drop imposed on fluid moving
   through the straight channels of such structures. Here, we report the
   impregnation of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), an effective aminopolymer
   reported commonly for CO2 separation, into extruded monolithic alumina
   to form structured CO2 sorbents. These structured sorbents are first
   prepared on a small scale, characterized thoroughly, and compared with
   powder sorbents with a similar composition. Despite consistent
   differences observed in the filling of mesopores with PEI between the
   monolithic and powder sorbents, their performance in CO2 adsorption is
   similar across a range of PEI contents. A larger monolithic cylinder (1
   inch diameter, 4 inch length) is evaluated under conditions closer to
   those that might be used in large-scale applications and shows a similar
   performance to the smaller monoliths and powders tested initially. This
   larger structure is evaluated over five cycles of CO2 adsorption and
   steam desorption and demonstrates a volumetric capacity of 350 mol(CO2)
   m(monolith)(-3) and an equilibration time of 350 min under a 0.4 ms(-1)
   linear flow velocity through the monolith channels using 400 ppm CO2 in
   N-2 as the adsorption gas at 30 degrees C. This volumetric capacity
   surpasses that of a similar technology considered previously, which
   suggested that CO2 could be removed from air at an operating cost as low
   as \$100 per ton.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography using prospective gating
   requires that data be acquired during intervals of minimal cardiac
   motion to obtain diagnostic images of the coronary vessels free of
   motion artifacts. This work is intended to assess B-mode
   echocardiography as a continuous-time indication of these quiescent
   periods to determine if echocardiography can be used as a
   cost-efficient, non-ionizing modality to develop new prospective gating
   techniques for cardiac CT. These new prospective gating approaches will
   not be based on echocardiography itself but on CT-compatible modalities
   derived from the mechanics of the heart (e.g. seismocardiography and
   impedance cardiography), unlike the current standard electrocardiogram.
   To this end, echocardiography and retrospectively-gated CT data were
   obtained from ten patients with varied cardiac conditions. CT
   reconstructions were made throughout the cardiac cycle. Motion of the
   interventricular septum (IVS) was calculated from both echocardiography
   and CT reconstructions using correlation-based, deviation techniques.
   The IVS was chosen because it (1) is visible in echocardiography images,
   whereas the coronary vessels generally are not, and (2) has been shown
   to be a suitable indicator of cardiac quiescence. Quiescent phases were
   calculated as the minima of IVS motion and CT volumes were reconstructed
   for these phases. The diagnostic quality of the CT reconstructions from
   phases calculated from echocardiography and CT data was graded on a
   four-point Likert scale by a board-certified radiologist
   fellowship-trained in cardiothoracic radiology. Using a Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test, no significant difference in the diagnostic quality of
   the coronary vessels was found between CT volumes reconstructed from
   echocardiography- and CT-selected phases. Additionally, there was a
   correlation of 0.956 between the echocardiography-and CT-selected
   phases. This initial work suggests that B-mode echocardiography can be
   used as a tool to develop CT-compatible gating techniques based on
   modalities derived from cardiac mechanics rather than relying on the ECG
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{Inspection and imaging through scattering layers is a decades-old
   problem in optics. Unlike x-ray and ultrasonic imaging techniques,
   time-domain spectroscopy methods can provide detailed chemical and
   structural information of subsurfaces along with their depth. Although
   high-resolution time-of-flight measurement in time-domain spectroscopy
   provides 3D information, unfortunately it also induces an unwanted
   sensitivity to misalignments of the system and distortion of the layers
   themselves. Such high sensitivity to alignment and sample surface is a
   well known problem in time-domain and interferometric imaging, and is a
   major concern when the alignment error is comparable to the pulse
   wavelength. Here, we propose and implement an algorithmic framework
   based on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization to remove
   such unwanted distortions from time-domain images. The method allows for
   recovery of the original sample texture in spite of the presence of
   temporal-spatial distortions. We address a blind-demodulation problem
   where, based on several observations of the sample texture modulated by
   undesired sweep distortions, the two classes of signals are separated
   with minimal damage to the main features. The performance of the method
   is examined in both synthetic and real data in the case of a terahertz
   time-domain system, and the successful reconstructions are demonstrated.
   The proposed general scheme can be implemented to advance inspection and
   imaging applications in THz and other time-resolved spectral imaging
   modalities. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A gravitational-wave (GW) transient was identified in data recorded by
   the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)
   detectors on 2015 September 14. The event, initially designated G184098
   and later given the name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By
   prior arrangement, preliminary estimates of the time, significance, and
   sky location of the event were shared with 63 teams of observers
   covering radio, optical, near-infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths
   with ground- and space-based facilities. In this Letter we describe the
   low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the sky localization of
   the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the follow-up
   observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates
   Network circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities,
   the GW sky localization coverage, the timeline, and depth of the
   observations. As this event turned out to be a binary black hole merger,
   there is little expectation of a detectable electromagnetic (EM)
   signature. Nevertheless, this first broadband campaign to search for a
   counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source represents a milestone and
   highlights the broad capabilities of the transient astronomy community
   and the observing strategies that have been developed to pursue neutron
   star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EM data and
   results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papers by
   the individual teams.}},

Abstract = {{How cells sense their mechanical environment and transduce forces into
   biochemical signals is a crucial yet unresolved question in
   mechanobiology. Platelets use receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb),
   specifically its alpha subunit (GPIb alpha), to signal as they tether
   and translocate on von Willebrand factor (VWF) of injured arterial
   surfaces against blood flow. Force slows VWF-GPIb alpha dissociation
   (catch bond) and unfolds the GPIb alpha leucine-rich repeat domain
   (LRRD) and juxtamembrane mechanosensitive domain (MSD). How these
   mechanical processes trigger biochemical signals remains unknown. Here
   we analyze these extracellular events and the resulting intracellular
   Ca2+ on a single platelet in real time, revealing that LRRD unfolding
   intensifies the Ca2+ signal analogously whereas MSD unfolding determines
   the Ca2+ type digitally. The >30nm macroglycopeptide separating the two
   domains transmits VWF-GPIb alpha bond lifetime prolonged by LRRD
   unfolding to enhance MSD unfolding cooperatively at an optimal force,
   which may serve as a design principle for a generic mechanosensory
   machine.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomers are a type of actuator materials that exhibit
   excellent performance as artificial muscles, but a high driving voltage
   is required for their operation. By using the amazingly high output
   voltage generated from a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a thin film
   dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) can be directly driven by the
   contact-separation motion of TENG, demonstrating a self-powered
   actuation system. A TENG with a tribo surface area of 100 cm(2) can
   induce an expansion strain of 14.5\% for the DEA samples (electrode
   diameter of 0.6 cm) when the system works stably within the
   contact-separation velocity ranging from 0.1 to 10 cm s(-1). Finally,
   two simple prototypes of an intelligent switch and a self-powered
   clamper based on the TENG and DEA are demonstrated. These results prove
   that the dielectric elastomer is an ideal material to work together with
   TENG and thereby the fabricated actuation system can potentially be
   applied to the field of electronic skin and soft robotics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel automated system for real-time measurements of
   water-soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) ions in atmospheric particles.
   Detection of SRP is based on molybdenum blue chemistry with Sn(II)
   chloride dihydrate reduction. The instrumentation consists of one
   particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS) coupled with a 250 cm path length
   liquid waveguide capillary cell (LWCC) and miniature fiber optic
   spectrometer, with detection wavelength set at 690 nm. The detection
   limit was 0.4 nM P, equivalent to 0.03 nmol P m(-3) in atmospheric
   particles. Comparison of SRP in collocate PM2.5 aerosol filter sampling
   with the PILS-LWCC on line system were in good agreement (n = 49, slope
   = 0.84, R-2 = 0.78). This novel technique offers at least an order of
   magnitude enhancement in sensitivity over existing approaches allowing
   for SRP measurements of unprecedented frequency (8 min), which will lead
   to greater understanding of the sources and impacts of SRP in
   atmospheric chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperbranched polyglycerol-block-polystyrene copolymers, denoted
   HPG-b-PS, are synthesized and employed as a new and effective
   unimolecular template for synthesizing colloidal gold (Au)
   nanoparticles. The coordination of noble metal precursors with polyether
   within the inner HPG core and subsequent in situ reduction enables the
   formation of well dispersed and stable PS-capped Au nanoparticles. The
   inner HPG core is produced via ring opening multibranching
   polymerization (ROMBP and subsequently converted into atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP) macroinitiators for the controlled growth
   of polystyrene (PS) arms possessing low polydispersity (PDI < 1.31). An
   initial investigation into the templating parameters of HPG-b-PS was
   undertaken by producing templates with different arm numbers (98 and
   117) and different PS chain lengths (i.e., molecular weight = 3500-13400
   g/mol). It was found that the PS chain length and solvent conditions
   affect the quality of the resulting PS capped colloidal Au
   nanoparticles. This work demonstrates, for the first time, a simple,
   lower-cost approach for templating nonpolar solvent-soluble PS-capped Au
   nanoparticles on the order of 10-30 nm in diameter.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamics and historical relevance of a jetting thermometer made of
   Chinese zisha ceramic}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Following a recent trend of scientific studies on artwork, we study here
   the thermodynamics of a thermometer made of zisha ceramic, related to
   the Chinese tea culture. The thermometer represents a boy who
   ``urinates{''} shortly after hot water is poured onto his head. Long
   jetting distance is said to indicate that the water temperature is hot
   enough to brew tea. Here, a thermodynamic model describes the jetting
   phenomenon of that pee-pee boy. The study demonstrates how thermal
   expansion of an interior air pocket causes jetting. A thermodynamic
   potential is shown to define maximum jetting velocity. Seven
   optimization criteria to maximize jetting distance are provided,
   including two dimensionless numbers. Predicted jetting distances, jet
   durations, and temperatures agree very well with infrared and optical
   measurements. Specifically, the study confirms that jetting distances
   are sensitive enough to measure water temperature in the context of tea
   brewing. Optimization results show that longer jets are produced by
   large individuals, with low body mass index, with a boyhood of medium
   size inclined at an angle pi/4. The study ends by considering the
   possibility that ceramic jetting artifacts like the pee-pee boy might
   have been the first thermometers known to mankind, before Galileo
   Galilei's thermoscope.}},

Abstract = {{All-solid-state sodium batteries, using solid electrolyte and abundant
   sodium resources, show great promise for safe, low-cost, and large-scale

   low-cost synthetic methods. Achieving the combination of these
   properties is a grand challenge for the synthesis of sulfide-based solid
   electrolytes. Design of the solid electrolyte Na3SbS4 is described,
   realizing excellent air stability and an economic synthesis based on
   hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory. This new solid electrolyte

Abstract = {{A coupled force-restore model of surface soil temperature and moisture
   (FRMEP) is formulated by incorporating the maximum entropy production
   model of surface heat fluxes and including the gravitational drainage
   term. The FRMEP model driven by surface net radiation and precipitation
   are independent of near-surface atmospheric variables with reduced
   sensitivity to the uncertainties of model input and parameters compared
   to the classical force-restore models (FRM). The FRMEP model was
   evaluated using observations from two field experiments with contrasting
   soil moisture conditions. The modeling errors of the FRMEP predicted
   surface temperature and soil moisture are lower than those of the
   classical FRMs forced by observed or bulk formula based surface heat
   fluxes (bias 1 similar to 2 degrees C versus similar to 4 degrees C,
   0.02m(3)m(-3) versus 0.05m(3)m(-3)). The diurnal variations of surface
   temperature, soil moisture, and surface heat fluxes are well captured by
   the FRMEP model measured by the high correlations between the model
   predictions and observations (r0.84). Our analysis suggests that the
   drainage term cannot be neglected under wet soil condition. A 1year
   simulation indicates that the FRMEP model captures the seasonal
   variation of surface temperature and soil moisture with bias less than 2
   degrees C and 0.01m(3)m(-3) and correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.9
   with observations, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, simulation, and validation experiments
   of a passive (battery-free) wireless frequency doubling antenna sensor
   for strain and crack sensing. Since the length of a patch antenna
   governs the antenna's resonance frequency, a patch antenna bonded to a
   structural surface can be used to measure mechanical strain or crack
   propagation by interrogating resonance frequency shift due to antenna
   length change. In comparison with previous approaches such as radio
   frequency identification, the frequency doubling scheme is proposed as a
   new signal modulation approach for the antenna sensor. The proposed
   approach can easily distinguish backscattered passive sensor signal (at
   the doubled frequency 2 f) from environmental electromagnetic
   reflections (at original reader interrogation frequency f). To
   accurately estimate the performance of the frequency doubling antenna
   sensor, a multi-physics coupled simulation framework is proposed to aid
   the sensor design while considering both the mechanical and
   electromagnetic behaviors. Two commercial software packages, COMSOL and
   Advanced Design System (ADS), are combined to leverage the features from
   each other. The simulated performance of the frequency doubling antenna
   sensor is further validated by experiments. The results show that the
   sensor is capable of detecting small strain changes and the growth of a
   small crack.}},

Abstract = {{CD8(+) T cells develop increased sensitivity following Ag experience,
   and differences in sensitivity exist between T cell memory subsets. How
   differential TCR signaling between memory subsets contributes to
   sensitivity differences is unclear. We show in mouse effector memory T
   cells (T-EM) that >50\% of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase
   (Lck) exists in a constitutively active conformation, compared with <
   20\% in central memory T cells (T-CM). Immediately proximal to Lck
   signaling, we observed enhanced Zap-70 phosphorylation in T-EM following
   TCR ligation compared with T-CM. Furthermore, we observed superior
   cytotoxic effector function in T-EM compared with T-CM, and we provide
   evidence that this results from a lower probability of T-CM reaching
   threshold signaling owing to the decreased magnitude of TCR-proximal
   signaling. We provide evidence that the differences in Lck constitutive
   activity between CD8(+) T-CM and T-EM are due to differential regulation
   by SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (Shp-1) and C-terminal Src
   kinase, and we use modeling of early TCR signaling to reveal the
   significance of these differences. We show that inhibition of Shp-1
   results in increased constitutive Lck activity in T-CM to levels similar
   to T-EM, as well as increased cytotoxic effector function in T-CM.
   Collectively, this work demonstrates a role for constitutive Lck
   activity in controlling Ag sensitivity, and it suggests that
   differential activities of TCR-proximal signaling components may
   contribute to establishing the divergent effector properties of T-CM and
   T-EM. This work also identifies Shp-1 as a potential target to improve
   the cytotoxic effector functions of T-CM for adoptive cell therapy
   applications.}},

Title = {{Role of integrin alpha 7 beta 1 signaling in myoblast differentiation on
   aligned polydioxanone scaffolds}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{44-54}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The aligned structural environment in skeletal muscle is believed to be
   a crucial component in functional muscle regeneration. Myotube formation
   is increased on aligned biomaterials, but we do not fully understand the
   mechanisms that direct this enhanced fusion. Previous studies indicate
   that the alpha 7 integrin subunit is upregulated during myoblast
   differentiation, suggesting that signaling via alpha 7 beta 1 mediates
   the effect of alignment. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of
   an in vitro model using random and aligned polydioxanone (PDO) matrices
   and C2C12 myoblasts. We measured expression and production of myoblast
   markers: paired box-7 (Pax7), myogenic differentiation factor-1 (MyoD),
   myogenin (MyoG), myogenic factor-6 (Myf6), and myosin heavy chain
   (MyHC). To examine the role of alpha 7 beta 1 signaling, we measured
   expression and production of alpha 7, alpha 5, and beta 1 and myoblast
   markers in wild type cells and in cells silenced for alpha 7 and
   assessed effects of silencing on myogenic differentiation. Downstream
   signaling via ERK1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) was
   examined using a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor. Alignment increased mRNAs
   and protein for early (MyoD) and late (MyoG, MyHC) myoblast markers in
   comparison to non-aligned matrices, and these levels corresponded with
   increased alpha 7 protein. alpha 7-silencing reduced MyoG and MyHC
   protein in cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene and aligned PDO
   matrices compared to wild type cells. Inhibition of ERK1/2 blocked
   effects of alignment. These data suggest that alignment regulates
   myogenic differentiation via alpha 7 beta 1 integrin signaling and
   ERK1/2 mediated gene expression.
   Statement of Significance
   Muscle regeneration in severe muscle injuries is complex, requiring a
   sequence of events to promote healing and not fibrosis. Aligned
   biomaterials that recapitulate muscle environments hold potential to
   facilitate regeneration, but it is important to understand
   cell-substrate signaling to form functional muscle. A critical component
   of muscle signaling is integrin alpha 7 beta 1, where mice lacking alpha
   7 exhibit a dystrophic phenotype and impaired regeneration. Here, we
   report the role of alpha 7 beta 1 signaling in myoblast differentiation
   on aligned biomaterials.
   alpha 7-silenced myoblasts were found to regulate myogenic
   differentiation and demonstrate defective fusion. Our data shows reduced
   levels of myogenin and myosin heavy chain protein, while MyoD remains
   unchanged. These results support the hypothesis that alpha 7 beta 1
   signaling plays a role in substrate-dependent tissue engineering
   strategies. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A life prediction method for the CFRP composite hydrogen storage vessel
   under cyclic fatigue loading and high temperature conditions was
   proposed based on the integration of micromechanics of failure (MMF) and

   the elastic solution of the cylindrical laminates subjected to internal
   pressure is obtained based on the classical laminate theory. Then, the
   MMF is used to calculate the constituent strength from ply strength at
   various temperatures, and the matrix fatigue master curves are
   constructed accordingly by using TTSP. Finally, a life prediction
   procedure using the constituent master curves is described and applied
   in the MATLAB software to predict the long-term fatigue life of the
   composite vessel. The reliability of MMF based methodology is also
   discussed by comparing the predicted results with the experimental ones.

Abstract = {{2,4-Dinitroanisole (DNAN), a low sensitivity replacement for TNT, is a
   key component of a new class of melt cast formulations designed for use
   in insensitive munitions. It is therefore essential that its fate and
   transport in the environment be assessed before its large scale
   implementation. Several recent studies have described reductive
   biotransformation pathways leading to dead-end products. Recently a
   Nocardioides strain, JS1661 was isolated based on its ability to
   mineralize DNAN via the 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) pathway. However, its
   potential for degrading DNAN under environmentally relevant conditions
   was not examined. Therefore we evaluated the aerobic biodegradation of
   DNAN by JS1661 in non-sterile soil, aqueous media and in a fluidized bed
   bioreactor over a wide range of DNAN concentrations. DNAN was completely
   degraded under all tested conditions with little or no accumulation of
   DNP and almost stoichiometric release of nitrite. Furthermore, when DNAN
   was used as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, the accumulation of
   nitrite was dramatically reduced. The results of the study revealed the
   robustness of the strain over a range of loading rates in various
   physical environments suggesting that it could provide the basis for
   waste treatment, bioremediation and bioaugmentation applications. (C)

Title = {{Post-combustion carbon dioxide capture via 6FDA/BPDA-DAM hollow fiber

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{510}},

Abstract = {{Post-combustion carbon dioxide capture has the greatest near-term
   potential compared to other technological pathways to mitigate CO2
   emissions. The hybrid membrane and cryogenic distillation process
   developed at American AirLiquide allows sub-ambient temperature (-50
   degrees C to -20 degrees C) CO2 capture to be cost effective. In
   previous work, Matrimid (R) hollow fiber membranes with so-called
   ``nodular{''} selective layers were successfully formed and showed a
   combination of high selectivity and high permeance at temperatures below
   -20 degrees C. Despite good performance, considering the low CO2
   concentration and large volume of flue gas to be treated, the permeance
   of the ``nodular{''} Matrimid (R) fibers still required improvement. In
   this work, a new membrane material with higher fractional free volume
   than Matrimid, 6FDA/BPDA-DAM (1:1), was investigated for sub-ambient
   temperature (SAT) CO2 capture. Defect free 6FDA/BPDA-DAM hollow fiber
   membranes were successfully formed; however, the bare fibers lost
   selectivity at temperatures below 0 degrees C, possibly due to the
   development of minor defects in the thin selective layer. This problem
   was corrected by post-treatment with polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS). The
   PDMS post-treated 6FDA/BPDA-DAM hollow fiber membranes displayed much
   higher permeance than the Matrimid (R) fibers with a high selectivity.
   The high selectivity is presumably due to additional polymer backbone
   rigidity at SAT conditions combined with possible local chain
   orientation; and the high permeance is believed to be a result of
   hindered packing of the polymer backbone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   degradation of the remanent polarization and overall piezoelectric
   response, as well as pinching of the polarization hysteresis curves and
   creation of multiple peaks in the permittivity-electric field curves
   post irradiation. The samples with oxide electrodes, however, were
   largely impervious to the same radiation dose, with less than 5\% change
   in any of the functional characteristics. The results suggest a
   radiation-induced change in the defect population or defect energy in
   PZT with metallic top electrodes, which substantially affects motion of
   internal interfaces such as domain walls. Additionally, the differences
   observed for stacks with different electrode materials implicate the
   ferroelectric-electrode interface as either the predominant source of
   radiation-induced effects (Pt electrodes) or the site of healing for
   radiation-induced defects (IrO2 electrodes). Published by AIP

Title = {{A method for distinguishing between propagons, diffusions, and locons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{The majority of intuition on phonon transport has been derived from
   studies of homogenous crystalline solids, where the atomic composition
   and structure are periodic. For this specific class of materials, the
   solutions to the equations of motions for the atoms (in the harmonic
   limit) result in plane wave modulated velocity fields for the normal
   modes of vibration. However, it has been known for several decades that
   whenever a system lacks periodicity, either compositional or structural,
   the normal modes of vibration can still be determined (in the harmonic
   limit), but the solutions take on different characteristics and many
   modes may not be plane wave modulated. Previous work has classified the
   types of vibrations into three primary categories, namely, propagons,
   diffusions, and locons. One can use the participation ratio to
   distinguish locons, from propagons and diffusons, which measures the
   extent to which a mode is localized. However, distinguishing between
   propagons and diffusons has remained a challenge, since both are
   spatially delocalized. Here, we present a new method that quantifies the
   extent to which a mode's character corresponds to a propagating mode,
   e.g., exhibits plane wave modulation. This then allows for clear and
   quantitative distinctions between propagons and diffusons. By resolving
   this issue quantitatively, one can now automate the classification of
   modes for any arbitrary material or structure, subject to a single
   constraint that the atoms must vibrate stably around their respective
   equilibrium sites. Several example test cases are studied including
   crystalline silicon and germanium, crystalline silicon with different
   defect concentrations, as well as amorphous silicon, germanium, and
   silica. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The increased demand for bulk hydrocarbons necessitates research into
   increasingly sustainable, energy-efficient catalytic processes. Owing to
   intricately designed structure-property correlations, SAPO-34 has become
   established as a promising material for the low temperature ethanol
   dehydration to produce ethylene. However, further optimization of this
   process requires a precise knowledge of the reaction mechanism at a
   molecular level. In order to achieve this a range of spectroscopic
   characterization techniques are required to probe both the interaction
   with the active site, and also the wider role of the framework. To this
   end we employ a combination of in situ infra-red and neutron scattering
   techniques to elucidate the influence of the surface ethoxy species in
   the activation of both diethyl ether and ethanol, towards the improved
   formation of ethylene at low temperatures. The combined conclusions of
   these studies is that the formation of ethylene is the rate determining
   step, which is of fundamental importance towards the development of this
   process and the introduction of bio-ethanol as a viable feedstock for
   ethylene production.}},

Abstract = {{Microscaled self-rolling construct sheets from silk protein material
   have been fabricated, containing a silk bimorph composed of silk
   ionomers as an active layer and cross-linked silk fisheet as the passive
   layer. The programmable morphology was experimentally explored along
   with a computational simulation to understand the mechanism of shape
   reconfiguration. The neutron reflectivity shows that the active silk
   ionomers layer undergoes remarkable swelling (eight times increase in
   thickness) after deprotonation while the passive silk fi-sheet retains
   constant volume under the same conditions and supports the bimorph
   construct. This selective swelling within the silk-on-silk bimorph
   microsheets generates strong interfacial stress between layers and
   out-of-plane forces, which trigger autonomous self -rolling into various
   3D constructs such as cylindrical and helical tubules. The experimental
   observations and computational modeling confirmed the role of
   interfacial stresses and allow programming the morphology of the 3D
   constructs with particular design. We demonstrated that the biaxial
   stress distribution over the 2D planar films depends upon the lateral
   dimensions, thickness and the aspect ratio of the microsheets. The
   results allow the fine-tuning of autonomous shape transformations for
   the further design of complex micro origami constructs and the silk
   based rolling/unrolling structures provide a promising platform for
   polymer -based biomimetic devices for implant applications.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonaceous nanomaterials with uniform pore size are potential solid
   sorbents in various industrial applications, such as gas purification
   and water treatment, because of their easily tunable pore diameter and
   morphology. However, the carbon-based sorbents are greatly limited in
   CO2 capture, because of their weak interaction with CO2 (physical
   adsorption in nature). This work reports the amino functionalizalion of
   micronized and nanosized mesoporous carbons for CO2 capture. Two
   strategies, i.e., physical impregnation with branched polyethylenimine
   (PEI) and chemical grafting of ethylenediamine, are used to
   functionalize mesoporous carbon microparticles (MCMs) with a particle
   size of 100-200 pan. The amine-grafted MCMs (NH2-MCMs) show little
   advantage over PEI-impregnated MCMs (PEI/MCMs) in CO2 adsorption
   capacities, because of their similar surface functional groups and
   textural properties. In addition, mesoporous carbon nanospheres (MCNs)
   with a sphere size of 850-1000 nm are prepared by a silica-assisted
   self-assembly method for comparison with MCMs. The PEI-impregnated MCNs
   (PEI/MCNs) have higher CO2 adsorption capacities and amine efficiencies
   than PEI/MCMs at the same PEI loading, indicating a more efficient
   utilization of the incorporated PEI in the nanosized carbon spheres. The
   best performing PEI/MCNs adsorbent shows a CO2 capacity of 1.97 mmol-CO2
   g(-1) at 75 degrees C, which is more than three times that of PEI/MCMs.}},

   Identification of a reaction network can be achieved by estimating a
   sparse parameter matrix containing the reaction network structure and
   kinetics information. Stochastic dynamics of a biochemical reaction
   network system is usually modeled by a chemical master equation (CME)
   describing the time evolution of probability distributions for all
   possible states. This paper considers closed monomolecular reaction
   systems for which an exact analytical solution of the corresponding
   chemical master equation can be derived. The estimation method presented
   in this paper incorporates the closed-form solution into a regularized
   maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for which model complexity is
   penalized. A simulation result is provided to verify performance
   improvement of regularized MLE over least-square estimation (LSE), which
   is based on a deterministic mass-average model, in the case of a small
   population size. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Revealing Rate Limitations in Nanocrystalline Li4Ti5O12 Anodes for
   High-Power Lithium Ion Batteries}},

Abstract = {{Li4Ti5O12 is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries due to
   its high safety, excellent cycling stability, environmental
   friendliness, and low cost. Strategies of incorporation with a
   conductive component (such as carbon) and constructing nano-structure
   are frequently adopted to improve the rate-capability of Li4Ti5O12 by
   means of enhancing the electronic conductivity and promoting the lithium
   ion transport within electrodes, respectively. However, which charge
   carrier transport process is the limiting step for Li4Ti5O12 electrode
   reactions still remains unclear, and this limits the abilities to
   rationally design high performance Li4Ti5O12 materials. In this work,
   the nanosized Li4Ti5O12 and Li4Ti5O12/C materials are prepared with
   nearly identical particle size and morphology. The results demonstrate
   that the synthesized single phase Li4Ti5O12 delivers a higher specific
   capacity and superior rate-capability than Li4Ti5O12/C composite. As
   such, in contrast to a popular belief, it is lithium ion transport that
   restricts kinetics of the electrochemical reactions on Li4Ti5O12. The
   synthesized single phase Li4Ti5O12 shows a specific capacity of
   approximate to 160 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and 130 mAhg(-1) at 50 C rates,
   respectively. This rate-capability is the best reported for Li4Ti5O12
   anodes. The single phase Li4Ti5O12 also demonstrated remarkable
   stability at high-temperature (50 degrees C), showing cycling life of
   over 4000 cycles at 1 C.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) approaches based on range-separated
   hybrid functionals are currently methods of choice for the description
   of the charge-transfer (CT) states in organic donor/acceptor solar
   cells. However, these calculations are usually performed on small-size
   donor/acceptor complexes and as result do not account for electronic
   polarization effects. Here, using a pentacene/C-60 complex as a model
   system, we discuss the ability of long-range corrected (LCR) hybrid
   functionals in combination with the polarizable continuum model (PCM) to
   determine the impact of the solid-state environment on the CT states.
   The CT energies are found to be insensitive to the interactions with the
   dielectric medium when a conventional time-dependent DFT/PCM (TDDFT/PCM)
   approach is used. However, a decrease in the energy of the CT state in
   the framework of LRC functionals can be obtained by using a smaller
   range-separated parameter when going from an isolated donor/acceptor
   complex to the solid-state case.}},

Abstract = {{Improving volumetric energy density is one of the major challenges in
   nanostructured carbon electrodes for electrochemical energy storage
   device applications. Herein, a simple hydrothermal oxidation process of
   single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks in dilute nitric acid is
   reported, enabling simultaneous physical densification and chemical
   functionalization of the as-assembled randomly-packed SWNT films. After
   the hydrothermal oxidation process, the density of the SWNT films
   increases from 0.63 to 1.02 g cm(-3) and a considerable amount of
   redox-active oxygen functional groups are introduced on the surface of
   the SWNTs. The functionalized SWNT films are used as positive electrodes
   against Li metal negative electrodes for potential Li-ion capacitors or
   Li-ion battery applications. The functionalized SWNT electrodes deliver
   high volumetric as well as gravimetric capacities, 154 Ah L-1 and 152
   mAh g(-1), respectively, owing to the surface redox reactions between
   the introduced oxygen functional groups and Li ions. In addition, these
   electrodes exhibit a remarkable rate-capability by retaining its high
   capacity of 94 Ah L-1 (92 mAh g(-1)) at a high discharge rate of 10 A
   g(-1). These results demonstrate the simple hydrothermal oxidation
   process as an attractive strategy for improving the volumetric
   performance of nanostructured carbon electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Seed-mediated syntheses utilizing facet-selective surface passivation
   provide the necessary chemical controls to direct noble metal
   nanostructure formation to a predetermined geometry. The foremost
   protocol for the synthesis of (111)-faceted Ag octahedra involves the
   reduction of metal ions onto pre-existing seeds in the presence of
   citrate and ascorbic acid. It is generally accepted that the capping of
   (111) facets with citrate dictates the shape while ascorbic acid acts
   solely as the reducing agent. Herein, a citrate-based synthesis is
   demonstrated in which the presence or absence of ascorbic acid is the
   shape-determining factor. Reactions are carried out in which Ag+ ions
   are reduced onto substrate-immobilized Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt seeds.
   Syntheses lacking ascorbic acid, in which citrate acts as both the
   capping and the reducing agent, result in a robust nanocube growth mode
   able to withstand wide variations in the concentration of reactants,
   reaction rates, seed material, seed orientation and faceting, pH, and
   substrate material. If, however, ascorbic acid is included in these
   syntheses, then the growth mode reverts to one that advances the
   octahedral geometry. The implication of these results is that citrate,
   or one of its oxidation products, selectively caps (100) facets, but
   where this capability is compromised by ascorbic acid.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of anode-supported solid oxide cells is often limited by
   gas transport in the thick anode substrate. In this study,
   anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with a cell configuration of
   Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC)vertical bar SDC vertical bar Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3
   (SSC)-SDC are fabricated by a combination of phase-inversion
   tape-casting, direct drop-coating on the green anode, and co-firing. The
   porous anode substrate is composed of a thin skin layer, a thick
   finger-like porous layer, and a thin sponge-like porous layer. The skin
   layer with fine pores offers extended three-phase boundaries (TPBs) at
   the electrolyte/anode interface while the finger like porous
   layer/support provides pore channels for efficient mass transport. Dense
   SDC electrolyte membranes with a thickness of similar to 15 mu m are
   obtained at a relatively low co-firing temperature (1400 degrees C) due
   to the large sintering shrinkage of the green anodes. Peak power
   densities of 0.608 Wcm(-2) at 600 degrees C and 0.789 Wcm(-2) at 650
   degrees C have been demonstrated using humidified (3 vol. \% water
   vapor) H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, suggesting that the
   triple-layered anode effectively decreases the anode polarization
   resistance and thus enhances the cell performance. (C) 2016 Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for
   beta-Bi2O3 photocatalyst that was modified with 32 elements. Our focus
   was to design visible light responsive photocatalysts for selective
   reduction of chlorinated organic compounds (COCs) in water. The wanted
   photocatalysts should have (1) a moderate adsorption potential for COCs;
   (2) a wide adsorption spectrum for harvesting visible light; and (3) a
   reduction potential enough to destroy COCs. Based on these assumptions,
   a combined grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulation study was used to investigate the adsorption and
   diffusion behaviors of COCs in 32 modified beta-Bi2O3 ; a
   Becke-three-parameter-Lee-Yand-Par (B3LYP) DFT method was used to
   calculate the energy band structures and redox potentials of different
   modified beta-Bi2O3 . Sequentially, these modified beta-Bi2O3 were
   synthesized by solvothermal method, and the photo-reactivity of them
   were quantified in terms of the conduction band (CB) electron reduction
   using pentachlorophenol (PCP), trichloroethylene (TCE), and
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) as model COCs. The results
   demonstrated that the adsorption, photoabsorption, and photo-reactivity
   of modified beta-Bi2O3 appear to be a complex function of the
   periodicity of 32 doped elements, which can be explained by the
   structural changes on the crystalline form and energy band structure.
   Based on this principle, a series of competent photocatalysts were
   believed to be efficient on the reduction of COCs. We designed and
   synthesized: (1) Ti-beta-Bi2O3 photocatalyst that performed best on
   reduction of PCP (37.2 mu mol L-1) with apparent quantum yield
   (phi(PCP)) of 1.20\%; (2) Sr-beta-Bi2O3 photocatalyst for TCE (76.2 mu
   mol L-1) reduction (phi(TCE) 1.03\%); and, (3) Zr-beta-Bi2O3
   photocatalyst for HCH (27.5 mol mu L-1) reduction (phi(HCH) 0.67\%). (C)

Abstract = {{Aerosol iron was examined in Saharan dust plumes using a combination of
   iron near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and wet-chemical
   techniques. Aerosol samples were collected at three sites located in the
   Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and Bermuda to characterize iron at
   different atmospheric transport lengths and time scales. Iron(III)
   oxides were a component of aerosols at all sampling sites and dominated
   the aerosol iron in Mediterranean samples. In Atlantic samples, iron(II
   and III) sulfate, iron(III) phosphate, and iron(II) silicates were also
   contributors to aerosol composition. With increased atmospheric
   transport time, iron(II) sulfates are found to become more abundant,
   aerosol iron oxidation state became more reduced, and aerosol acidity
   increased. Atmospheric processing including acidic reactions and
   photoreduction likely influence the form of iron minerals and oxidation
   state in Saharan dust aerosols and contribute to increases in
   aerosol-iron solubility.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we detail how the morphology of a nanomaterial affects its
   environmental lifetime in aquatic ecosystems. In particular, we focus on
   the cube and particle nanostructures of Ag and age them in various
   aquatic mediums including synthetic hard water, pond water, and
   seawater. Our results show that in the synthetic hard water and pond
   water cases, there was little difference in the rate of morphological
   changes as determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. However, when these
   samples were analyzed with transmission electron microscopy, radically
   different mechanisms in the loss of their original nanostructures were
   observed. Specifically, for the nanocube we observed that the corners of
   the cubes had become more rounded, whereas the aged nanoparticles formed
   large aggregates. Most interestingly, when the seawater samples were
   analyzed, the nanocubes showed a substantially higher stability in
   maintaining the nano length scale in comparison to nanoparticles
   overtime. Moreover, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   analysis allowed us to determine that Ag+ ions diffused away from both
   the edge and from the faces of the cube, whereas the nanoparticle
   rapidly aggregated under the harsh seawater conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel selective denitrification process, referred as O-3-ethanol
   oxidation method, was developed by injecting O-3 and ethanol mixtures
   into the simulated flue gas duct. The organic radicals, generated
   through the ethanol oxidation by O-3, can oxidize NO into NO2, and
   finally into important industrial raw, namely, nitrate organics or
   aqueous nitrate acids. The residual ethanol in the tail can be recycled.
   The CO32-, HCO3- and SO2 in the flue gas hardly exhibit any effect on
   the NOX removal. Compared to the conventional O-3 oxidation method, the
   present method shows higher selective oxidation of NO, higher NOX
   removal and less O-3 consumption as well as proves lower initial
   investment and operating costs with more compact equipment. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend several well-known document listing problems to
   the case when documents contain a substring that approximately matches
   the query pattern. We study the scenario when the query string can
   contain a wildcard symbol that matches any alphabet symbol; all
   documents that match a query pattern with one wildcard must be
   enumerated. We describe a linear space data structure that reports all
   documents containing a substring Pin O(vertical bar P vertical bar +
   sigma root logloglog n + docc) time, where sigma is the alphabet size
   and docc is the number of listed documents. We also describe a succinct
   solution for this problem, as well as a solution for an extension of
   this problem. Furthermore our approach enables us to obtain an O (n
   sigma)-space data structure that enumerates all documents containing
   both a pattern P-1 and a pattern P-2 in the special case when P-1 and
   P-2 differ in one symbol. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An active controller for a UAV helicopter carrying a slung load is
   described in this paper. The objective of the controller is to allow the
   UAV to safely transport a slung load and to place it precisely on a
   moving ground platform such as a moving truck or a ship. In order to
   fulfill this objective, an active slung load controller is synthesized
   that forms an outer loop in providing trajectory commands to an existing
   automatic flight control system (AFCS) of an unmanned helicopter. The
   synthesized controller consists of three sub-components; first a target
   position tracker which generates position tracking commands, second a
   load oscillation controller which generates load oscillation damping
   commands, and third an adaptive neural network which compensates for
   uncertainties associated with flight environment and/or modeling errors.
   A linear proportional-plus-derivative (PD) controller is used for the
   target position tracking control. A nonlinear controller based on
   feedback linearization of the slung load dynamics is used for the load
   oscillation control. A single hidden layer neural network with an
   adaptive gain update is used for uncertainty compensation. The proposed
   controller is evaluated in simulations within the Georgia Tech UAV
   Simulation Tool (GUST) and inflight tests using the GTMax UAV helicopter
   test-bed. Both simulation and flight test results are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in dampening of
   load oscillations while simultaneously reducing position errors relative
   to a virtual moving ground platform, in the presence of random ground
   vehicle motion, wind gusts, and modeling errors.}},

Abstract = {{A compelling confluence of technology and application trends in which
   the cost, execution time, and energy of applications are being dominated
   by the memory system is driving the industry to 3D packages for future
   microarchitectures. However, these packages result in high heat fluxes
   and increased thermal coupling challenging current thermal solutions.
   Conventional design approaches utilize design margins that correspond to
   worst case temperatures and process corners leading to a significant
   impact on system level performance. This paper advocates a design
   approach based on microarchitecture adaptation to device-level
   temperature-dependent delay variations to realize average case
   performance that is superior to which can be achieved by using worst
   case design margins. We demonstrate this approach with adaptation
   principles for the last level cache (LLC) in a 3D many-core
   architecture. We propose and evaluate two adaptation mechanisms. In the
   first case, the access time to the LLC from the L1 tracks the LLC's
   temperature-delay variations. In the second case, the processor DVFS
   state tracks the LLC temperature as a negative feedback. Compared to a
   worst case design baseline, the full system simulation results show that
   both approaches increase the IPC by over 20 percent, and improve the
   energy efficiency by up to 3 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term experiments indicate that seawater acidification can cause a
   decrease in the rate of calcification by coccolithophores, but the
   relationship between carbonate chemistry and coccolithophore
   calcification rate in natural assemblages is still unclear. During the
   Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, we measured primary production,
   calcification, coccolithophore abundance, particulate inorganic carbon
   (PIC) concentration, and the parameters of the carbonate system, along
   basin-scale transects in the tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific
   oceans. Euphotic layer-integrated calcification and mean cell-specific
   calcification in the euphotic layer ranged between 2-10 mgC m(-2) d(-1)
   and 5-20 pgC cell(-1) d(-1), respectively. We found a significant
   relationship between primary production and calcification, such that the
   calcification to primary production (CP/PP) ratio was relatively
   invariant among ocean basins, with an overall mean value of 0.05 +/-
   0.04. Extrapolating this value to the entire ocean would result in a
   global pelagic calcification rate of 2.4 PtC yr(-1). The mean PIC
   concentration in surface waters was 1.8 +/- 1.6 mgC m(-3) and its
   turnover time averaged 20 d. We combined our data of calcification,
   primary production, and carbonate chemistry from Malaspina 2010 with
   those obtained during two previous cruises in the northern Arabian Sea.
   Both the CP/PP ratio and cell-specific calcification were largely
   constant across a wide range of calcite saturation state (1.5-6.5),
   {[}HCO3-]/{[}H+] (0.08-0.24; mol: mu mol), and pH (7.6-8.1), which
   indicates that calcification by natural coccolithophore assemblages was
   independent of carbonate chemistry. Our results suggest that
   coccolithophore calcification, at least in tropical regions, may not be
   decreasing in the currently acidifying ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Layered black phosphorus has triggered enormous interest since its
   recent emergence. Compared to most other two-dimensional materials,
   black phosphorus features a moderate band gap and pronounced in-plane
   anisotropy, which stems from the unique atomic-puckering crystal
   structure. The future potential of black phosphorus in optoelectronics
   demands a deeper understanding of its unique anisotropic behavior. In
   particular, the phase information on light when interacting with the
   material is imperative for many applications in the optical regime. In
   this work we have comprehensively studied a wide range of optical
   anisotropic properties of black phosphorus, including the Raman
   scattering, extinction spectra, and phase retardance by utilizing
   conventional spectral measurements and a uniquely developed
   interferometric spectroscopy and imaging technique. The phase retardance
   of light passed through black phosphorus is exploited in conjunction
   with polarization interferometric techniques to demonstrate an optical
   contrast an order of magnitude higher than a purely polarization-based
   measurement could offer.}},

Abstract = {{The use of intra/inter-cellular calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling for
   molecular communication (MC) is investigated in this paper. In
   particular, the elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration upon
   the external excitation, i.e., Ca2+ wave generation, and the
   intercellular propagation of Ca2+ wave over consecutive cells are
   studied for information transmission. The main objective of this paper
   is to develop a linear channel model for intra/inter-cellular Ca2+ MC.
   In this context, the end-to-end Ca2+ MC system is studied under three
   blocks: the wave generation, the gap junctional (intercellular)
   propagation, and the intracellular propagation. The wave generation
   block captures the intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathway including the
   release of Ca2+ from the organelles and the buffers inside a cell, and
   the intake from the extracellular space. The gap junctional
   (intercellular) propagation block captures the Ca2+ transition through
   the gap junctions between the touching cells. The intracellular
   propagation block defines the effect of the cytoplasmic diffusion. Using
   the developed blocks for the different biophysical phenomena, the
   end-to-end channel gain and delay formulas are derived. Furthermore, the
   bit error probability is studied to reveal the impact of the detection
   threshold. This work provides the basis for the modeling, analysis and
   the design of Ca2+ MC systems.}},

   compare the four probability sky maps produced for the
   gravitational-wave transient GW150914, and provide additional details of
   the EM follow-up observations that were performed in the different
   bands.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz (0.06-10 THz) band communication is envisioned as a key
   technology to satisfy the increasing demand for ultrahigh-speed wireless
   links. In this paper, a distance-aware bandwidth-adaptive resource
   allocation scheme is developed for THz band communication networks,
   which has the objective to improve the distance. The proposed scheme
   captures the unique channel peculiarities including the relationship
   between the distance and the bandwidth, and strategically utilizes the
   spectrum to enable multiple ultrahigh-speed links. Based on the
   developed scheme, the subwindows of the THz spectrum, the modulations,
   and the transmit power are adaptively allocated, for both single-user
   and multiuser communications. The numerical results show that the
   developed resource allocation scheme improves the distances and
   exploitation of the THz spectrum significantly. Specifically, 10 Gb/s
   can be supported at 4 m in the multipath channel, while 100 Gb/s is
   achieved up to 21 m in the line-of-sight transmission with the use of 20
   dB gain antennas. Furthermore, in the multiuser network, 14 10 Gb/s
   links can be supported simultaneously in the multipath channel. With the
   use of 20 dB gain antennas, 13 100 Gb/s links can be supported at the
   same time. Moreover, the developed resource allocation scheme
   outperforms the existing millimeter-wave systems and the nonadaptive
   scheme. This paper achieves the design objective and contributes to
   enable multiple ultrahigh-speed links in the THz band communication
   network.}},

Title = {{Collaborative Investigation of the Aerodynamic Behavior of Airfoils in
   Reverse Flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HELICOPTER SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Two (static and dynamic) fundamental models of the flow over airfoils in
   the reverse flow region of a helicopter in forward flight are
   investigated experimentally and computationally at Reynolds numbers of
   O(10(5)). The first model examines the time-averaged and unsteady flow
   resulting from a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil held at a static
   angle of attack. Computational tools successfully predict the presence
   of three unsteady wake regimes and time-averaged airloads measured
   experimentally at the University of Maryland (UMD). A second model is
   investigated by pitching a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil through
   deep dynamic stall in reverse flow. Both experimental and computational
   results reveal flow separation at the sharp leading edge for shallow
   angles of attack, leading to the early formation of a reverse flow
   dynamic stall vortex. Subsequent flow features in the pitching cycle
   (i.e., a trailing edge vortex and a secondary dynamic stall vortex) are
   also captured by the numerical simulation, although the timing and
   strength of some of these features do not align completely with
   experiment. This work gives fundamental insight into the aerodynamic
   behavior of airfoils in reverse flow, improves understanding of the
   complex nature of the reverse flow region, and demonstrates a promising
   new computational tool for simulating this unique flow regime.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the effect of temperature, pressure, and time on the
   magnitude of induced auxetic response in post-manufacture-processed
   needle-punched nonwovens. Different combinations of these processing
   parameters - temperatures ranging from room temperature to above the
   glass transition temperature (T-g) of constituent fibers, pressure of
   0.49 or 2.45 MPa, and duration of 4 or 24 h - were used to process these
   nonwovens. This resulted in some permanent compression (defined as
   ``compression set{''}) and in out-of-plane auxetic behavior of the
   fabric, both of which were found to be proportional to the severity of
   the processing conditions employed. Milder processing conditions were
   found to be insufficient in producing significant compression set and
   hence produced little or no auxetic response. Using micro-CT and optical
   video microscopy techniques, it was found that the processing conditions
   caused the fiber bundles present in needle-punched nonwovens to assume a
   buckled/tilted state, which opened up during mechanical extension and
   hence were instrumental in the observed thickness increase. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{To delineate the influence of hemodynamic force on cell adhesion
   processes, model in vitro fluidic assays that mimic physiological
   conditions are commonly employed. Herein, we offer a framework for
   solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to estimate the forces resulting from
   fluid flow near a plane acting on a sphere that is either stationary or
   in free flow, and we compare these results to a widely used theoretical
   model that assumes Stokes flow with a constant shear rate. We find that
   while the full three-dimensional solutions using a parabolic velocity
   profile in CFD simulations yield similar translational velocities to
   those predicted by the theoretical method, the CFD approach results in
   approximately 50\% larger rotational velocities over the wall shear
   stress range of 0.1-5.0 dynes cm(-2). This leads to an approximately
   25\% difference in force and torque calculations between the two
   methods. When compared with experimental measurements of translational
   and rotational velocities of microspheres or cells perfused in
   microfluidic channels, the CFD simulations yield significantly less
   error. We propose that CFD modelling can provide better estimations of
   hemodynamic force levels acting on perfused microspheres and cells in
   flow fields through microfluidic devices used for cell adhesion dynamics
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid wing-body configurations, such as the N2A-EXTE, have the
   potential to meet NASA Environmentally Responsible AviationN + 2 goals.
   These configurations have redundant elevons typically spanning the
   entire trailing edge of the wing, for which the large areas result in
   the generation of large hinge moments. To ensure aircraft stability with
   a reduced static margin, high control surface deflection rates may also
   be required. The combination of large actuation loads and rates results
   in significant actuation power requirements, which affect both fuel burn
   and the sizing of the actuation subsystem. In the early design phases,
   there is significant uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the
   actuation power, which may depend on the vehicle's static margin, the
   design and designated roles of the redundant control surfaces, actuator
   design parameters, and the intensity of encountered atmospheric
   turbulence. The objective of this paper is to present a methodical
   approach for assessing this uncertainty and relating it to aspects of
   the vehicle and actuation system design. Doing so will facilitate
   decision-making in early vehicle design. Following the sizing and
   optimization of electric actuators to meet the actuation requirements of
   the N2A-EXTE hybrid wing-body configuration's control surfaces, the
   power consumption of these actuators was evaluated in cruise conditions
   under the following scenarios: 1) varying atmospheric turbulence, 2)
   varying vehicle center of gravity, 3) varying control surface
   utilization, and 4) varying actuator design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The physical mechanisms that govern the electrical interaction between
   the Hall-effect-thruster electrical circuit and the conductive
   vacuum-facility walls are not fully understood. As a representative test
   bed, an Aerojet Rocketdyne T-140 Hall-effect thruster is operated at
   3.05 kW and a xenon mass flow rate of 11.6 mg/s with a vacuum facility
   operating neutral pressure of 7.3 x 10(-6) torr, corrected for xenon.
   Two electrical witness plates, representative of the facility chamber
   walls, are placed 2.3 m radially outward from thruster centerline and
   4.3 m axially downstream from the thruster exit plane. The cathode is
   radially translated from 18.1 to 77.8 cm away from the thruster
   centerline. At each cathode position, the discharge current and the
   electrical waveform of the radial and axial plates are simultaneously
   measured. As the cathode radial position changes from 18.1 to 77.8 cm
   from the thruster centerline, the discharge-current oscillation
   frequency decreases between 17 and 35\% for the electrically grounded
   thruster-body case, and between 15 and 23\% for the electrically
   floating thruster-body case. The analysis of the electron current
   collected by the radial plate suggests that electrons directly sourced
   from the cathode impinge on the radial plate at large cathode positions.
   Overall, the results of this work show that the chamber walls act as an
   artificial electrical boundary condition that keeps the
   Hall-effect-thruster plume plasma potential to within certain bounds.}},

Abstract = {{Blind deconvolution (BD), the resolution of a signal and a filter given
   their convolution, arises in many applications. Without further
   constraints, BD is ill-posed. In practice, subspace or sparsity
   constraints have been imposed to reduce the search space, and have shown
   some empirical success. However, the existing theoretical analysis on
   uniqueness in BD is rather limited. In an effort to address the still
   open question, we derive sufficient conditions under which two vectors
   can be uniquely identified from their circular convolution, subject to
   subspace or sparsity constraints. These sufficient conditions provide
   the first algebraic sample complexities for BD. We first derive a
   sufficient condition that applies to almost all bases or frames. For BD
   of vectors in C-n, with two subspace constraints of dimensions m(1) and
   m(2), the required sample complexity is n >= m(1)m(2). Then, we impose a
   sub-band structure on one basis, and derive a sufficient condition that
   involves a relaxed sample complexity n >= m(1) + m(2)-1, which we show
   to be optimal. We present the extensions of these results to BD with
   sparsity constraints or mixed constraints, with the sparsity level
   replacing the subspace dimension. The cost for the unknown support in
   this case is an extra factor of 2 in the sample complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Air-insulated switchgear cabinet plays a critical role in entire power
   transmission and distribution system. Its stability directly affects the
   operational reliability of the power system. And the on-line gas
   detection method, which evaluates the insulation status of insulation
   equipment by detecting the decomposition components of filled air in
   cabinet, becomes an innovative way to ensure the running stability of
   air-insulated switchgear cabinet. In order to study the characteristic
   gas types and production regularity of decomposition components under
   partial discharge, three insulation defects: needle-plate, air-gap and
   impurity defect are proposed to simulate the insulation defects under
   partial discharge in air-insulated switchgear cabinet. Firstly, the
   generation pathways and mechanism of composition components are
   discussed. Then CO and NO2 are selected as the characteristic
   decomposition components to characterize the partial discharge due to
   their high concentration and chemical stability. Based on the different
   change regularity of CO and NO2 concentration under different insulation
   defect, it provides an effective way to evaluate and predict the
   insulation defect type and severity in the field. (C) 2016 Author(s).

Abstract = {{Objective: The combination of phenomic data from electronic health
   records (EHR) and clinical data repositories with dense biological data
   has enabled genomic and pharmacogenomic discovery, a first step toward
   precision medicine. Computational methods for the identification of
   clinical phenotypes from EHR data will advance our understanding of
   disease risk and drug response, and support the practice of precision
   medicine on a national scale.
   Methods: Based on our experience within three national research
   networks, we summarize the broad approaches to clinical phenotyping and
   highlight the important role of these networks in the progression of
   high-throughput phenotyping and precision medicine. We provide
   supporting literature in the form of a non-systematic review.
   Results: The practice of clinical phenotyping is evolving to meet the
   growing demand for scalable, portable, and data driven methods and
   tools. The resources required for traditional phenotyping algorithms
   from expert defined rules are significant. In contrast, machine learning
   approaches that rely on data patterns will require fewer clinical domain
   experts and resources.
   Conclusions: Machine learning approaches that generate phenotype
   definitions from patient features and clinical profiles will result in
   truly computational phenotypes, derived from data rather than experts.
   Research networks and phenotype developers should cooperate to develop
   methods, collaboration platforms, and data standards that will enable
   computational phenotyping and truly modernize biomedical research and
   precision medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an analysis of pressure transients in conduits that
   includes effects of variable conduit diameter and contrasts in fluid
   material properties. The analysis considers pressure applied to the
   outside of a submerged conduit, as well as that transmitted along the
   submerged conduit's interior with potential applications such as
   analysis of submerged pipelines or tubing in oil wells or in wells used
   in solution mining.
   In this work, we present a method for monitoring the dissolution of
   carbonate rock with acid to create a cavern for storing natural gas.
   This process includes an acid injection pipe and a brine production pipe
   submerged in the fluid-filled cavern. The motivation is to characterize
   the geometry of the cavern by analyzing pressure transients traveling
   down the acid injection pipe, interacting with the walls of the cavern
   and compressing the brine pipe, and traveling to a pressure transducer
   in the brine pipe. The conventional water-hammer equations were modified
   to include the pressure applied to the outside of a submerged conduit,
   and the resulting boundary value problems were solved with perturbation
   analysis. The results show that peak pressure at an observation point
   decreases more than one order of magnitude when the cavern diameter
   increases one order of magnitude. This suggests that the proposed
   approach is sensitive to cavern diameter. Consideration of the external
   loading provides a potential mechanism for locating an interface between
   fluids of different properties, such as the interface between acid/CO2
   mixture and underlying brine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data in the
   substantia nigra (SN) using a more consistent region of interest (ROI)
   defined by neuromelanin-sensitive MRI in order to assess Parkinson's
   disease (PD) related changes in diffusion characteristics in the SN.
   Methods: T-1-weighted and DTI data were obtained in a cohort of 37
   subjects (17 control subjects and 20 subjects with PD). The subjects in
   the PD group were clinically diagnosed PD patients with an average
   Unified Parkinsonian Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III score of 23.2 +/-
   9.3. DTI data were analyzed using SN ROIs defined by
   neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and, for comparison, with ROIs defined on
   T-2-weighted images (b = 0 images). Results: Compared with control
   subjects, significantly lower fractional anisotropy was observed in PD
   in the neuromelanin SN ROI but not in the ROI derived from the
   T-2-weighted image. This decrease was largest in the rostral and lateral
   portions of the neuromelanin volume, which were found to have more
   hypointensity in the T-2-weighted image and, presumably, higher iron
   content in the PD group. In addition, a larger decrease in fractional
   anisotropy was seen in the SN region of interest on the side
   contralateral to the side exhibiting more severe symptoms. These results
   indicate that the use of neuromelanin sensitive MRI to define the ROI in
   the SN for analyzing DTI data leads to more significant results,
   enhancing the robustness of DTI study and DTI based biomarkers of PD.

Abstract = {{Emerging millimeter-wave ( mmWave) and Terahertz ( THz) systems is a
   promising revolution for next-generation wireless communications. In
   this paper, we study an indoor multi-user mmWave and sub-THz system with
   large antenna arrays, where two different types of architecture, the
   fully-connected structure and the array-of-subarray structure, are
   investigated. Specifically, the Doherty power amplifier ( PA) is adopted
   to improve the PA efficiency of the system, and the associated nonlinear
   system power consumption models with insertion power loss are developed.
   By capturing the characteristics of the mmWave and sub-THz channels, we
   design different hybrid beamforming schemes for the two structures with
   low complexity. We further compare the achievable rates of the two
   structures and show that, with the insertion loss, the achievable rate
   of the array-of-subarray structure is generally larger than that of the
   fully-connected structure. Moreover, we propose the optimal power
   control strategies for both structures to maximize the energy efficiency
   of the system and demonstrate that the energy efficiency of the
   array-of-subarray structure outperforms that of the fully-connected
   structure. Simulation results are provided to compare and validate the
   performance of the two structures, where the array-of-subarray structure
   shows a great advantage over the fully-connected structure in both
   spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional mobile data offloading transfers cellular users to WiFi
   networks to relieve the cellular system from the pressure of the
   ever-increasing data traffic load. However, the spectrum utilization of
   the WiFi network is bound to suffer from potential packet collisions due
   to its contention-based access protocol, especially when the number of
   competing WiFi users grows large. To tackle this problem, we propose
   transfering some WiFi users to be served by the LTE system, in contrast
   to the traditional mobile data offloading which effectively offloads LTE
   traffic to the WiFi network. Meanwhile, leveraging the emerging LTE in
   unlicensed spectrum ( LTE-U) technology, some unlicensed spectrum
   resources may be allocated to the LTE system in compensation for
   handling more WiFi users. In this way, a win-win situation would be
   generated since LTE can generally achieve better performance than WiFi
   due to its capability of centralized co-ordination. To facilitate it,
   three important challenging issues are addressed in the paper: which
   WiFi users should be transferred; how many WiFi users need to be
   transferred; and how much unlicensed resources should be relinquished to
   the LTE-U network. We investigate three different user transfer schemes
   according to the availability of channel state information ( CSI): the
   random transfer, the distance-based transfer, and the CSI-based
   transfer. In each scheme, the minimum required amount of unlicensed
   resources under a given transferred user number is analyzed.
   Furthermore, we utilize the Nash bargaining solution ( NBS) to develop
   joint user transfer and unlicensed resource allocation strategy to
   fulfill the win-win situation for both networks, whose performance is
   demonstrated by numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the retirement planning question that a single taxpayer or
   couple faces when determining an amount to save for retirement and the
   type of retirement account in which to allocate the assets.
   Additionally, taxpayers can choose to convert savings from one account
   type, such as a traditional individual retirement arrangement (IRA),
   into another, such as a Roth IRA; all such choices have both immediate
   and long-term tax consequences. We give the rationale for applying
   stochastic optimization in this setting and explain how such an
   optimization model can be constructed as a multiple-stage stochastic
   linear or mixed-integer program. Optimized Financial Systems implements
   such a model and uses it to advise clients; we demonstrate the
   approach's benefits by examining its recommendations both for test data
   and in a case study based on an actual customer.}},

Abstract = {{The inhalable particles from vehicle exhaust can cause DNA damage to
   exposed organisms. Research on DNA damage is primarily focused on the
   influence of specific pollutants on certain species or the effect of
   environmental pollution on human beings. To date, little research has
   quantitatively studied the relationship between roadside pollution and
   DNA damage. Based on an investigation of the roadside pollution in
   Beijing, Euonymus japonicus leaves of differing ages grown in
   heavily-polluted sections were chosen as biomonitors to detect DNA
   damage using the comet assay technique. The percentage of DNA in the
   tail and tail moment was chosen as the analysis index based on SPSS data
   analysis. The roadside samples showed significantly higher levels of DNA
   damage than non-roadside samples, which increased in older leaves, and
   the DNA damage to Euonymus japonicus leaf cells was positively
   correlated with haze -aggravated roadside pollution. The correlation
   between damage and the Air Quality Index (AQI) are 0.921 (one-year-old
   leaves), 0.894 (two -year -old leaves), and 0.878 (three-year-old
   leaves). Over time, the connection between DNA damage and AQI weakened,
   with the sensitivity coefficient for 6year 1 being larger than 6year 2
   and 6year 3. These findings support the suitability and sensitivity of
   the comet assay for surveying plants for an estimation of DNA damage
   induced by environmental genotoxic agents. This study might be applied
   as a preliminary quantitative method for Chinese urban air pollution
   damage assessment caused by environmental stress.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that optimizing network topology by switching on and
   off transmission lines improves the efficiency of power delivery in
   electrical networks. In fact, the USA Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Section
   1223) states that the United States should ``encourage, as appropriate,
   the deployment of advanced transmission technologies{''} including
   ``optimized transmission line configurations.{''} As such, many authors
   have studied the problem of determining an optimal set of transmission
   lines to switch off to minimize the cost of meeting a given power demand
   under the direct current (DC) model of power flow. This problem is known
   in the literature as the Direct-Current Optimal Transmission Switching
   Problem (DC-OTS). Most research on DC-OTS has focused on heuristic
   algorithms for generating quality solutions or on the application of
   DC-OTS to crucial operational and strategic problems such as contingency
   correction, real-time dispatch, and transmission expansion. The
   mathematical theory of the DC-OTS problem is less well developed. In
   this work, we formally establish that DC-OTS is NP-Hard, even if the
   power network is a series-parallel graph with at most one load/demand
   pair. Inspired by Kirchoff's Voltage Law, we provide a cycle-based
   formulation for DC-OTS, and we use the new formulation to build a
   cycle-induced relaxation. We characterize the convex hull of the
   cycle-induced relaxation; this characterization provides strong valid
   inequalities that can be used in a cutting-plane approach to solve the
   DC-OTS. We give details of a practical implementation, and we show
   promising computational results on standard benchmark instances.}},

Abstract = {{-strengthened nickel-based superalloys are developed for
   high-performance systems such as jet engines, internal combustion
   engines, and gas turbines. Their excellent properties are given by
   specifically designed microstructure. Unfortunately, the structure is
   deformed during machining. Too much deformation generated results in
   components with low mechanical integrity and reduced in-service life.
   Experimental investigations indicated that the machining affected zone
   or subsurface damage formation for nickel-based superalloys is an
   atypical phenomenon; its dependence on the process parameters is
   fundamentally different from the conventional materials. This research
   investigates subsurface damage formation in orthogonal cutting tests
   performed on nickel-based superalloys, followed by empirical and
   numerical modeling. The simulations are used to estimate the depth of
   the subsurface damage and are compared with the experimental results.
   The knowledge can then be applied to select optimum cutting parameters
   for an acceptable depth of subsurface damage.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, neem tree (Azadirachta indica) extract (NTE) has been reported
   to have various antitumor activities against gastric, breast, prostate,
   and skin cancer, respectively. The current study was designed to
   evaluate the effect of NTE on hepatic cancer in a mouse model. The
   possible side effects elicited by NTE were also evaluated. The
   components in NTE were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS). H22 cells-bearing Kumming mice were generated by
   injecting H22 cells subcutaneously into the right forelimb armpit of the
   mice. Then the mice were treated daily for 27 days with NTE (150, 300,
   and 600 mg/kg body weight) by intragastric administration, using
   carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, 1\%) as blank control and cyclophosphamide
   (CTX, 20 mg/kg) as positive control. The antitumor effect of NTE was
   evaluated by assessment of survival rate, body weight, tumor volume and
   weight, tumor histology, thymus and spleen indexes, and liver histology.
   The tumor weight and volume in groups of NTE and CTX were significantly
   lower than those in the CMC group. The survival rate in the NTE group
   receiving the high dose (600 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that
   in the CTX and CMC groups. Compared with CTX, NTE was observed to have a
   tumor-specific cytotoxicity without impairing the normal liver tissue.
   Additionally, the higher indexes of thymus and spleen indicated that NTE
   could facilitate the growth of immune organs. The results indicate that
   NTE is a promising candidate for the antitumor treatment with high
   efficacy and safety.}},

   assays. We identified specific up-regulation of chemokine receptor CXCR4
   on both mouse and human macrophages and characterized in vivo expression
   of CXCR4 in a resolving model of murine peritonitis. Using adoptive
   transfer and AMD3100 blocking, we confirmed a role for CXCR4 in
   macrophage egress to draining lymphatics. Collectively these data
   provide an important mechanistic link between efferocytosis and

Title = {{Directional acuity of whole-body perturbations during standing balance}},
Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{77-82}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The ability to perceive the direction of whole-body motion during
   standing may be critical to maintaining balance and preventing a fall.
   Our first goal was to quantify kinesthetic perception of whole-body
   motion by estimating directional acuity thresholds of support-surface
   perturbations during standing. The directional acuity threshold to
   lateral deviations in backward support-surface motion in healthy, young
   adults was quantified as 9.5 +/- 2.48 degrees using the psychometric
   method (n = 25 subjects). However, inherent limitations in the
   psychometric method, such as a large number of required trials and the
   predetermined stimulus set, may preclude wider use of this method in
   clinical populations. Our second goal was to validate an adaptive
   algorithm known as parameter estimation by sequential testing (PEST) as
   an alternative threshold estimation technique to minimize the required
   trial count without predetermined knowledge of the relevant stimulus
   space. The directional acuity threshold was estimated at 11.7 +/- 3.88
   from the PEST method (n = 11 of 25 subjects, psychometric threshold =
   10.1 +/- 3.18) using only one-third the number of trials compared to the
   psychometric method. Furthermore, PEST estimates of the direction acuity
   threshold were highly correlated with the psychometric estimates across
   subjects (r = 0.93) suggesting that both methods provide comparable
   estimates of the perceptual threshold. Computational modeling of both
   techniques revealed similar variance in the estimated thresholds across
   simulations of about 1 degrees. Our results suggest that the PEST
   algorithm can be used to more quickly quantify whole-body directional
   acuity during standing in individuals with balance impairments. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Harvesting biomechanical energy in vivo is an important route in
   obtaining sustainable electric energy for powering implantable medical
   devices. Here, we demonstrate an innovative implantable triboelectric
   nanogenerator (iTENG) for in vivo biomechanical energy harvesting.
   Driven by the heartbeat of adult swine, the output voltage and the
   corresponding current were improved by factors of 3.5 and 25,
   respectively, compared with the reported in vivo output performance of
   biomechanical energy conversion devices. In addition, the in vivo
   evaluation of the iTENG was demonstrated for over 72 h of implantation,
   during which the iTENG generated electricity continuously in the active
   animal. Due to its excellent in vivo performance, a self-powered
   wireless transmission system was fabricated for real-time wireless
   cardiac monitoring. Given its outstanding in vivo output and stability,
   iTENG can be applied not only to power implantable medical devices but
   also possibly to fabricate a self-powered, wireless healthcare
   monitoring system.}},

Title = {{Harvesting Broad Frequency Band Blue Energy by a
   Triboelectric-Electromagnetic Hybrid Nanogenerator}},
Journal = {{ACS Nano}},

Abstract = {{Ocean wave associated energy is huge, but it has little use toward world
   energy. Although such blue energy is capable of meeting all of our
   energy needs, there is no effective way to harvest it due to its low
   frequency and irregular amplitude, which may restrict the application of
   traditional power generators. In this work, we report a hybrid
   nanogenerator that consists of a spiral-interdigitated-electrode
   triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG) and a wrap-around electromagnetic
   generator (W-EMG) for harvesting ocean energy. In this design, the STENG
   can be fully isolated from the external environment through packaging
   and indirectly driven by the noncontact attractive forces between pairs
   of magnets, and W-EMG can be easily hybridized. Notably, the hybrid
   nanogenerator could generate electricity under either rotation mode or
   fluctuation mode to collect energy in ocean tide, current, and wave
   energy due to the unique structural design. In addition, the
   characteristics and advantages of outputs indicate that the S-TENG is
   irreplaceable for harvesting low rotation speeds (<100 rpm) or motion
   frequencies (<2 Hz) energy, which fits the frequency range for most of
   the water wave based blue energy, while WEMG is able to produce larger
   output at high frequencies (>10 Hz). The complementary output can be
   maximized and hybridized for harvesting energy in a broad frequency
   range. Finally, a single hybrid nanogenerator unit was demonstrated to
   harvest blue energy as a practical power source to drive several LEDs
   under different simulated water wave conditions. We also proposed a blue
   energy harvesting system floating on the ocean surface that could
   simultaneously harvest wind, solar, and wave energy. The proposed hybrid
   nanogenerator renders an effective and sustainable progress in practical
   applications of the hybrid nanogenerator toward harvesting water wave
   energy offered by nature.}},

Abstract = {{We report single-component ultrathin reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
   nanomembranes fabricated via nonconventional layer-by-layer assembly
   (LbL) of graphene oxide flakes, using organic solvent instead of water
   to provide strong complementary interactions and to ensure the uniform
   layered growth. This unique approach does not require regular polymeric
   from the assembly process or intermediate surface chemical modification.
   The resulting ultrastrong freestanding graphene oxide (rGO) LbL
   nanomembranes with a very low thickness of 3 nm (three GO monolayers)
   can be transferred over a large surface area across tens of square
   centimeters by using a facile surface-tension-assisted release
   technique. These uniform and ultrasmooth nanomembranes with high
   transparency (up to 93\% at 550 nm) and high electrical conductivity (up
   to 3000 S/m) also exhibit outstanding mechanical strength of 0.5 GPa and
   a Young's modulus of 120 GPa, which are several times higher than that
   of other reported regular rGO films. Furthermore, up to 94 wt \% of
   silver nanoplates can be sandwiched between 5 nm GO layers to construct
   a flexible freestanding protected noble metal monolayer with
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering properties. These flexible rGO/Ag/rGO
   nanomembranes can be transferred and conformally coat complex surfaces
   and show a cleaner Raman signature, enhanced wet stability, and lower
   oxidation compared to bare Ag nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{The currently low delivery efficiency and limited tumor penetration of
   nanoparticles remain two major challenges of cancer nanomedicine. Here,
   we report a class of pH-responsive nanoparticle superstructures with
   ultrasensitive size switching in the acidic tumor microenvironment for
   improved tumor penetration and effective in vivo drug delivery. The
   superstructures were constructed from amphiphilic polymer directed
   assembly of platinum-prodrug conjugated polyamido-amine (PAMAM)
   dendrimers, in which the amphiphilic polymer contains ionizable tertiary
   amine groups for rapid pH-responsiveness. These superstructures had an
   initial size of similar to 80 nm at neutral pH (e.g., in blood
   circulation), but once deposited in the slightly acidic tumor
   microenvironment (pH similar to 6.5-7.0), they underwent a dramatic and
   sharp size transition within a very narrow range of acidity (less than
   0.1-0.2 pH units) and dissociated instantaneously into the dendrimer
   building blocks (less than 10 nm in diameter). This rapid size-switching
   feature not only can facilitate nanoparticle extravasation and
   accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention effect but also
   allows faster nanoparticle diffusion and more efficient tumor
   penetration. We have further carried out comparative studies of
   pH-sensitive and insensitive nanostructures with similar size, surface
   charge, and chemical composition in both multicellular spheroids and
   poorly permeable BxPC-3 pancreatic tumor models, whose results
   demonstrate that the pH-triggered size switching is a viable strategy
   for improving drug penetration and therapeutic efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Perfectly ordered states are targets in diverse molecular to microscale
   systems involving, for example, atomic clusters, protein folding,
   protein crystallization, nanoparticle superlattices, and colloidal
   crystals. However, there is no obvious approach to control the assembly
   of perfectly ordered global free energy minimum structures;
   near-equilibrium assembly is impractically slow, and faster
   out-of-equilibrium processes generally terminate in defective states.
   Here, we demonstrate the rapid and robust assembly of perfect crystals
   by navigating kinetic bottlenecks using closed-loop control of electric
   field mediated crystallization of colloidal particles. An optimal policy
   is computed with dynamic programming using a reaction coordinate based
   dynamic model. By tracking real-time stochastic particle configurations
   and adjusting applied fields via feedback, the evolution of unassembled
   particles is guided through polycrystalline states into single domain
   crystals. This approach to controlling the assembly of a target
   structure is based on general principles that make it applicable to a
   broad range of processes from nano- to microscales (where tuning a
   global thermodynamic variable yields temporal control over thermal
   sampling of different states via their relative free energies).}},

   the faulty cells. Next, the physical location of the failure sites
   within SRAM cells is determined. There are some fault sites for
   different mechanisms which result in exactly the same electrical failure
   signature. For these faulty sites, the cause of failure probabilities
   for each wearout mechanism is estimated by matching the observed failure
   rate from BIST and the failure rate distribution computed by simulation
   and as a function of circuit use scenarios. The estimation of wearout
   distributions is helpful in determining the wearout limiting mechanisms

Abstract = {{The reactions of dihydroxyfumarate with glyoxylate and formaldehyde
   exhibit a unique pH-controlled mechanistic divergence leading to
   different product suites by two distinct pathways. The divergent
   reactions proceed via a central intermediate
   (2,3-dihydroxy-oxalosuccinate, 3, in the reaction with glyoxylate and
   2-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-3-oxosuccinate, 14, in the reaction with
   formaldehyde). At pH 7-8, products (7, 8, and 15) exclusively from a
   decarboxylation of the intermediate are observed, while at pH 13-14,
   products (9, 10, and 16) solely derived from a hydroxide-promoted
   fragmentation of the intermediate are formed. The decarboxylative and
   fragmentation pathways are mutually exclusive and do not appear to
   coexist under the range of pH (7-14) conditions investigated. Herein, we
   employ a combination of quantitative C-13 NMR measurements and density
   functional theory calculations to provide a rationale for this pH-driven
   reaction divergence. These rationalizations also hold true for the
   reactions of dihydroxyfumarate produced in situ by the catalytic
   cyanide-mediated dimerization of glyoxylate. In addition, the
   non-enzymatic decarboxylation and fragmentation transformations of these
   central intermediates (3 and 14) appear to have intriguing parallels to
   the enzymatic reactions of oxalosuccinate and formation of glyceric acid
   derivatives in extant metabolism - the high and low pH mimicking the
   precise control exerted by the enzymes over reaction pathways. Copyright

Abstract = {{Background: Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) play a vital role in the
   medical care of newborns and infants. There is expected to be a shortage
   of NNPs in the near future.
   Purpose: To assess the present NNP workforce and study the impact of
   potential policy changes to alleviate forecasted shortages.
   Methods: We modeled the education and workforce system for NNPs.
   Forecasting models were combined with optimal decision-making to derive
   best-case scenario admission levels for graduate and undergraduate
   programs.
   Discussion: Under the best-case scenario for the current system, the
   shortage of NNPs is expected to last 10 years. We analyzed the impact of
   improving the certification examination passing rate, increasing the
   annual growth rate of master's programs, and reducing the workforce
   annual attrition rate. We found that policy changes may reduce the
   forecasted shortage to 4 years.
   Conclusion: Present forecasts of demand for NNPs indicate that the
   existing workforce and education system will be unable to satisfy the
   growing demand. Policy changes may reduce the expected shortage and
   potentially improve access to care for newborns and infants.}},

   Perovskite}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Organometal halide perovskites exhibit not only extraordinary electronic
   properties but also interesting ionic responses due to the ease of
   forming and moving native defects in the perovskite lattice. In this
   work such dual (electronic and ionic) conduction property is exploited
   to fabricate a thin film electrochemical capacitor (EC) based on
   organolead triiodide perovskite. The EC cells show excellent cyclability
   with stable capacitance output beyond 10 000 cycles. By performing
   electrochemical characterizations on the cells with different
   electrolytes and perovskite thickness, it is found that the perovskite
   layer serves not only as an electrode but also a solid electrolyte.
   Through circuit modeling of the electrochemical impedance spectra, the
   density of mobile ions (i.e., ionic native defects) in the perovskite
   films is extracted and is found to be lower than those estimated from
   perovskite electronic devices, e.g., solar cells. The result suggests
   that the ion formation and transport processes in organometal halide
   perovskites may largely be activated by the current of free charge
   carriers as well as specific interface defects.}},

   interdiffusion between PBC and LSCF grains is further investigated by
   transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron
   microscopy combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy. The

Abstract = {{This brief presents a nonisolated multilevel linear amplifier with
   nonlinear component (LINC) power amplifier (PA) implemented in a
   standard 0.18-mu m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process.
   Using a nonisolated power combiner, the overall power efficiency is
   increased by reducing the wasted power at the combined out-phased
   signal; however, the efficiency at low power still needs to be improved.
   To further improve the efficiency of the low-power (LP) mode, we propose
   a multiple-output power-level LINC PA, with load modulation implemented
   by switches. In addition, analysis of the proposed design on the system
   level as well as the circuit level was performed to optimize its
   performance. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed
   technique maintains more than 45\% power-added efficiency (PAE) for peak
   power at 21 dB for the high-power mode and 17 dBm for the LP mode at 600
   MHz. The PAE for a 6-dB peak-to-average ratio orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing modulated signal is higher than 24\% PAE
   in both power modes. To the authors' knowledge, the proposed
   output-phasing PA is the first implemented multilevel LINC PA that uses
   quarter-wave lines without multiple power supply sources.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling limits on all-spin logic (ASL) are theoretically studied using
   the spin circuit theory and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
   equation under the macrospin approximation. It is found that as ASL
   circuits are scaled, the device delay significantly increases due to a
   stronger dipole coupling between the input and the output magnets. The
   effect of the dipole interaction can be mitigated by increasing the
   input current and by using smaller magnets with stronger material
   anisotropy and weaker saturation magnetization. Furthermore, the
   presence of the leakage current modifies the device delay. Finally, both
   delay and energy of ASL dramatically increase as the shunt path is
   shortened. Possible solutions to eliminate the leakage current and the
   shunt path are discussed.}},

   every i is an element of \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} and every vertex v is an

   It follows that G has fractional domatic number at least 5/2. This is

Abstract = {{Artificial photosynthesis relies on the availability of semiconductors
   that are chemically stable and can efficiently capture solar energy.
   Although metal oxide semiconductors have been investigated for their
   promise to resist oxidative attack, materials in this class can suffer
   from chemical and photochemical instability. Here we present a
   methodology for evaluating corrosion mechanisms and apply it to bismuth
   vanadate, a state-of-the-art photoanode. Analysis of changing morphology
   and composition under solar water splitting conditions reveals chemical
   instabilities that are not predicted from thermodynamic considerations
   of stable solid oxide phases, as represented by the Pourbaix diagram for
   the system. Computational modelling indicates that photoexcited charge
   carriers accumulated at the surface destabilize the lattice, and that
   self-passivation by formation of a chemically stable surface phase is
   kinetically hindered. Although chemical stability of metal oxides cannot
   be assumed, insight into corrosion mechanisms aids development of
   protection strategies and discovery of semiconductors with improved
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Both cells and ants belong to the broad field of active matter, a novel
   class of non-equilibrium materials composed of many interacting units
   that individually consume energy and collectively generate motion or
   mechanical stresses. However cells and ants differ from fish and birds
   in that they can support static loads. This is because cells and ants
   can be entangled, so that individual units are bound by transient links.
   Entanglement gives cells and ants a set of remarkable properties usually
   not found together, such as the ability to flow like a fluid, spring
   back like an elastic solid, and self-heal. In this review, we present
   the biology, mechanics and dynamics of both entangled cells and ants. We
   apply concepts from soft matter physics and wetting to characterize
   these systems as well as to point out their differences, which arise
   from their differences in size. We hope that our viewpoints will spur
   further investigations into cells and ants as active materials, and
   inspire the fabrication of synthetic active matter.}},

Abstract = {{Solar cells fabricated on boron (B)-doped Czochralski (Cz) Si wafers in
   the photovoltaic industry are known to suffer from light-induced
   degradation (LID) in efficiency. This paper reports on promising
   LID-free large-area indium (In)-doped Cz Si solar cells. Two different
   commercial-grade B-doped Cz materials were included for comparison. To
   study the impact of LID on the cell structure, ion-implanted large-area
   (239 and 242.22 cm(2)) screen-printed full aluminum (Al) back-surface
   field (BSF) baseline cells, as well as higher performance passivated
   emitter rear cells (PERC) with oxide passivation and local Al BSF, were
   fabricated. In-doped PERC cells achieved 20.3\% efficiency, while the
   B-doped cells gave efficiencies of 20.7\% and 20.5\% from low- (2
   Omega.cm) and high-resistivity (6.2 Omega.cm) substrates, respectively.
   It was found that initial efficiency of In-dopedPERCcells was similar to
   0.2\% lower due to lower bulk lifetime and higher back-surface
   recombination velocity. However, In-doped PERC cells showed no LID and
   surpassed the B-doped PERC cell efficiency by 0.3-0.5\% after 0.8-sun
   48-h illumination at 37 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{The effect on normal incidence acoustic impedance of a non-circular
   orifice shape is examined relative to a circular orifice. The impedance
   of an adjustable porosity perforate, formed from two identical
   perforates sliding over each other, is measured. As the orifice shape
   becomes more non-circular, the measured impedance is found to deviate
   from the predicted results for a circular orifice of the same area.
   Several isolated orifices of the same open area but different shapes are
   tested and compared with a circular orifice. Both low incident sound
   pressure levels using broadband noise and high incident sound pressure
   levels using sinusoidal tones are used to evaluate the impedance
   performance of these isolated orifices. One orifice mimics the unique
   shape produced by the adjustable perforate and results in a smaller
   attached mass (or mass end correction) compared with a round orifice.
   This is consistent with the perforate impedance results. The unique
   orifice shape does not appear to have measurable differences in acoustic
   normal resistance at high incident sound pressure levels. However, since
   the attached mass plays a key role in determining the peak absorption
   frequency of resonant liners, the reduction in attached mass relative to
   a circular orifice has implications where these types of orifices are
   used.}},

Abstract = {{Craniosynostosis occurs in approximately 1 in 2,000 children and results
   from the premature fusion of >= 1 cranial sutures. If left untreated,
   craniosynostosis can cause numerous complications as related to an
   increase in intracranial pressure or as a direct result from cranial
   deformities, or both. More than 100 known mutations may cause syndromic
   craniosynostosis, but the majority of cases are nonsyndromic, occurring
   as isolated defects. Most cases of craniosynostosis require complex
   cranial vault reconstruction that is associated with a high risk of
   morbidity. While the first operation typically has few complications,
   bone rapidly regrows in up to 40\% of children who undergo it. This
   resynostosis typically requires additional surgical intervention, which
   can be associated with a high incidence of life-threatening
   complications. This article reviews work related to the dental and
   maxillofacial implications of craniosynostosis and discusses clinically
   relevant animal models related to craniosynostosis and resynostosis. In
   addition, information is provided on the imaging modalities used to
   study cranial defects in animals and humans.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the effects of turning process parameters on
   recrystallization behavior in Al alloy 7075. To realize this purpose,
   samples were machined under different cutting speeds and material feed
   rates at two extreme levels. Microscopy imaging reveals that activation
   of dynamic recrystallization or grain growth depends on the combination
   of applied cutting parameters. Increasing the cutting speed intensifies
   recrystallization, while the feed rate governs the grain growth.
   Adjusting the cutting parameters enables one to obtain a desired average
   grain size below the machined surface, up to a similar to 180 mu m
   depth. The average grain size of the initial material was 31.6 mu m. The
   imposed processing parameters successfully yielded average grain sizes
   in the range from 19 to 44 mu m. Additionally, a computational framework
   work consisting of finite-element analysis (FEA) coupled with
   kinetic-based modeling of recrystallization was developed, which is
   capable of following the trend of change in the average grain size and
   acceptably predicts the evolved average grain size.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous response and resistance of cancer cells to
   chemotherapeutic drugs pose a significant challenge for successful
   cancer treatments. In this study, an integrated experimental and
   theoretical analysis of cellular drug transport was developed. The
   experimental platform, called tumor-microenvironment-on-chip (T-MOC), is
   a microfluidic platform where cancer cells were cultured within a
   three-dimensional extracellular matrix perfused with interstitial fluid.
   Three types of human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and
   SUM-159PT) were cultured on this T-MOC platform, and their drug response
   and resistance to doxorubicin were characterized by time-lapse
   quantitative fluorescence microscopy. To study the effects of
   nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery, the transport and action of
   doxorubicin encapsulated nanoparticles were also examined. Based on the
   experimental data obtained, a theoretical model was developed to
   quantify and ultimately predict the cellular transport processes of
   drugs cell-type specifically. The results demonstrate that the cellular
   drug transport can be cell type-specifically quantified by rate
   constants representing the uptake and efflux of doxorubicin across the
   cellular membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) transistors are among the most
   developed nanoelectronic devices for high-performance computing
   applications. While p-type SWCNT transistors are easily achieved through
   adventitious adsorption of atmospheric oxygen, n-type SWCNT transistors
   require extrinsic doping schemes. Existing n-type doping strategies for
   SWCNT transistors suffer from one or more issues including environmental
   instability, limited carrier concentration modulation, undesirable
   threshold voltage control, and/or poor morphology. In particular,
   commonly employed benzyl viologen n-type doping layers possess large
   thicknesses, which preclude top-gate transistor designs that underlie
   high-density integrated circuit layouts. To overcome these limitations,
   we report here the controlled n-type doping of SWCNT thin-film
   transistors with a solution-processed pentamethylrhodocene dimer. The
   charge transport properties of organorhodium-treated SWCNT thin films
   show consistent n-type behavior when characterized in both Hall effect
   and thin-film transistor geometries. Due to the molecular-scale
   thickness of the organorhodium adlayer, large-area arrays of top-gated,
   n-type SWCNT transistors are fabricated with high yield. This work will
   thus facilitate ongoing efforts to realize high-density SWCNT integrated
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Short-range communication between cells is required for the survival of
   multicellular organisms. One mechanism of chemical signaling between
   adjacent cells employs surface displayed ligands and receptors that only
   bind when two cells make physical contact. Ligand receptor complexes
   that form at the cell cell junction and physically bridge two cells
   likely experience mechanical forces. A fundamental challenge in this
   area pertains to mapping the mechanical forces experienced by ligand
   receptor complexes within such a fluid intermembrane junction. Herein,
   we describe the development of ratiometric tension probes for direct
   imaging of receptor tension, clustering, and lateral transport within a
   model cell cell junction. These probes employ two fluorescent reporters
   that quantify both the ligand density and the ligand tension and thus
   generate a tension signal independent of clustering. As a
   proof-of-concept, we applied the ratiometric tension probes to map the
   forces experienced by the T-cell receptor (TCR) during activation and
   showed the first direct evidence that the TCR-ligand complex experiences
   sustained pN forces within a fluid membrane junction. We envision that
   the ratiometric tension probes will be broadly useful for investigating
   mechanotransduction in juxtacrine signaling pathways.}},

   permits the achievement of a range window about 60 times larger than the

Abstract = {{Uncertainty estimation plays an important role in source apportionment
   models such as the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. In this
   study, synthetic datasets were generated and analyzed using PMF with
   specified uncertainties at different levels to investigate the impact of
   uncertainty inputs on the results of PMF model, as well as the benefits
   and risks of emphasizing on certain species. The results showed that:
   (1) uncertainties for the PMF model should be estimated based on
   characteristics of the dataset being analyzed; (2) emphasizing on
   correct tracers will improved model performance; and (3) emphasizing on
   unsuitable tracers may lead to disruptive consequences that might not be
   captured by the Q metric. Tests were also performed on collected ambient
   PM2.5 samples and similar conclusions were drawn: emphasizing on correct
   tracers was shown to improve the separation of important source
   categories from mixed sources. When emphasizing on incorrect tracers, a
   counterfeit factor of Fe industrial source was extracted, which are
   inconsistent with field observations. Results from this study provide
   insights on how uncertainties should be estimated for the PMF model.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of construction, indoor localization of mobile construction
   resources remains a universal challenge. Although discussions have
   focused on the tracking accuracy and affordability of indoor
   localization technologies, few efforts have focused on practical
   criteria such as ease of use, latency, and data visualization and remote
   sharing. To close this gap in knowledge, this study introduces a
   building information modeling (BIM) and cloud-enabled radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) localization system. The system consists of three
   main components: the passive RFID localization system, the BIM
   visualization system, and the cloud computing system. The proposed
   system is tested in a full-scale implementation on an actual
   construction site. The test was designed and conducted to evaluate the
   localization accuracy, data latency, and real-time data processing and
   visualization for remote monitoring. A comprehensive analysis is made of
   various practical issues based on the test results and panel discussion.
   The findings in this study indicate that the BIM and cloud-enable RFID
   indoor localization solution has a great potential in practical
   applications such as site security control, safety management, asset
   management, and productivity monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional bluff body aerodynamics are pertinent across a broad
   range of engineering disciplines. In three-dimensional bluff body flows,
   shear layer behaviour has a primary influence on the surface pressure
   distributions and, therefore, the integrated forces and moments. There
   currently exists a significant gap in understanding of the flow around
   canonical three-dimensional bluff bodies such as rectangular prisms and
   short circular cylinders. High-fidelity numerical experiments using a
   hybrid turbulence closure that resolves large eddies in separated wakes
   close this gap and provide new insights into the unsteady behaviour of
   these bodies. A time-averaging technique that captures the mean shear
   layer behaviours in these unsteady turbulent flows is developed, and
   empirical characterizations are developed for important quantities,
   including the shear layer reattachment distance, the separation bubble
   pressure, the maximum reattachment pressure, and the stagnation point
   location. Many of these quantities are found to exhibit a universal
   behaviour that varies only with the incidence angle and face shape (flat
   or curved) when an appropriate normalization is applied.}},

Title = {{A Lagrangian study of turbulent mixing: forward and backward dispersion
   of molecular trajectories in isotropic turbulence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{799}},
Pages = {{352-382}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Statistics of the trajectories of molecules diffusing via Brownian
   motion in a turbulent flow are extracted from simulations of stationary
   isotropic turbulence, using a postprocessing approach applicable in both
   forward and backward reference frames. Detailed results are obtained for
   Schmidt numbers (Sc) from 0.001 to 1000 at Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers
   up to 1000. The statistics of displacements of single molecules compare
   well with the earlier theoretical work of Saffman (J. Fluid Mech. vol.
   8, 1960, pp. 273-283) except for the scaling of the integral time scale
   of the fluid velocity following the molecular trajectories. For
   molecular pairs we extend Saffman's theory to include pairs of small but
   finite initial separation, which is in excellent agreement with
   numerical results provided that data are collected at sufficiently small
   times. At intermediate times the separation statistics of molecular
   pairs exhibit a more robust Richardson scaling behaviour than for the
   fluid particles. The forward scaling constant is very close to 0.55,
   whereas the backward constant is approximately 1.53-1.57, with a weak
   Schmidt number dependence, although no scaling exists if Sc << 1 at the
   Reynolds numbers presently accessible. An important innovation in this
   work is to demonstrate explicitly the practical utility of a Lagrangian
   description of turbulent mixing, where molecular displacements and
   separations in the limit of small backward initial separation can be
   used to calculate the evolution of scalar fluctuations resulting from a
   known source function in space. Lagrangian calculations of the
   production and dissipation rates of the scalar fluctuations are shown to
   agree very well with Eulerian results for the case of passive scalars
   driven by a uniform mean gradient. Although the Eulerian-Lagrangian
   comparisons are made only for Sc similar to O(1), the Lagrangian
   approach is more easily extended to both very low and very high Schmidt
   numbers. The well-known scalar dissipation anomaly is accordingly also
   addressed in a Lagrangian context.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine messenger RNA (mRNA)
   levels of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands, receptors, and
   soluble inhibitors in cells isolated from single-suture synostoses from
   fused coronal, me topic, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures.
   METHODS Cells were isolated from bone collected from patients undergoing
   craniotomies at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Real-time polymerase
   chain reaction was used to examine mRNA levels in cells isolated from
   fused sutures or patent sutures in comparison with levels in normal bone
   from the same patient.
   RESULTS Cells isolated from fused sutures in cases of sagittal and
   coronal synostosis highly expressed BMP2, while cells isolated from
   fused metopic or lambdoid synostosis expressed high BMP4. Noggin, a BMP
   inhibitor, was lower in fused sutures and had high expression in patent
   sutures.
   CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that BMPs and inhibitors play a
   significant role in the regulation of suture fusion as well in the
   maintenance of patency in the normal suture.}},

Abstract = {{Large craniofacial defects require efficient bone replacements which
   should not only provide good aesthetics but also possess stable
   structural function. The proposed work uses a novel multiresolution
   topology optimization method to achieve the task. Using a compliance
   minimization objective, patient-specific bone replacement shapes can be
   designed for different clinical cases that ensure revival of efficient
   load transfer mechanisms in the mid-face. In this work, four clinical
   cases are introduced and their respective patient-specific designs are
   obtained using the proposed method. The optimized designs are then
   virtually inserted into the defect to visually inspect the viability of
   the design . Further, once the design is verified by the reconstructive
   surgeon, prototypes are fabricated using a 3D printer for validation.
   The robustness of the designs are mechanically tested by subjecting them
   to a physiological loading condition which mimics the masticatory
   activity. The full-field strain result through 3D image correlation and
   the finite element analysis implies that the solution can survive the
   maximum mastication of 120 lb. Also, the designs have the potential to
   restore the buttress system and provide the structural integrity. Using
   the topology optimization framework in designing the bone replacement
   shapes would deliver surgeons new alternatives for rather complicated
   mid-face reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Children with congenital heart diseases have increased morbidity and
   mortality, despite various surgical treatments, therefore warranting
   better treatment strategies. Here we investigate the role of age of
   human pediatric cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) on ventricular
   remodeling in a model of juvenile heart failure. hCPCs isolated from
   children undergoing reconstructive surgeries were divided into 3 groups
   based on age: neonate (1 day to 1 month), infant (1 month to 1year), and
   child (1 to 5 years). Adolescent athymic rats were subjected to sham or
   pulmonary artery banding surgery to generate a model of right
   ventricular (RV) heart failure. Two weeks after surgery, hCPCs were
   injected in RV musculature noninvasively. Analysis of cardiac function 4
   weeks post-transplantation demonstrated significantly increased
   tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and RV ejection fraction and
   significantly decreased wall thickness and fibrosis in rats transplanted
   with neonatal hCPCs compared with saline-injected rats. Computational
   modeling and systems biology analysis were performed on arrays and gave
   insights into potential mechanisms at the microRNA and gene level.
   Mechanisms including migration and proliferation assays, as suggested by
   computational modeling, showed improved chemotactic and proliferative
   capacity of neonatal hCPCs compared with infant/child hCPCs. In vivo
   immunostaining further suggested increased recruitment of stem cell
   antigen 1-positive cells in the right ventricle. This is the first study
   to assess the role of hCPC age in juvenile RV heart failure.
   Interestingly, the reparative potential of hCPCs is age-dependent, with
   neonatal hCPCs exerting the maximum beneficial effect compared with
   infant and child hCPCs.}},

   identify physicochemical phenomena in each stage. In the first stage,
   the particle is heated to the melting temperature of the aluminum core.
   Key processes are heat and mass transfer between the gas and particle
   surface and diffusion of mass and energy inside the particle. The second
   stage begins upon melting of the aluminum core. Melting results in
   pressure buildup, thereby facilitating mass diffusion and/or cracking of
   the oxide layer. Melting is followed by polymorphic phase
   transformations, which also results in the formation of openings in the
   oxide layer. These provide pathways for the molten aluminum to react
   with the oxidizing gas; the ensuing energy release results in ignition
   of nano-aluminum particles. For large micron-sized particles, ignition
   is not achieved due to their greater volumetric heat capacity. In the
   third stage, nanoparticles undergo vigorous self-sustaining reactions
   with the oxidizing gas. Reactions typically occur heterogeneously in the
   particle and the burning rate is controlled by chemical kinetics. For
   large micron-sized particles, polymorphic phase transformations result
   in the formation of a crystalline oxide layer. The oxide layer melts and
   particle ignition is achieved. In the fourth stage, the large
   micron-sized particle burns through gas-phase or surface reactions,
   depending on the oxidizer and pressure. The burning rate is controlled
   by mass diffusion through the gas-phase mixture. (C) 2016 The Combustion

Abstract = {{The authors derive a measure suitable for identifying sensor placements
   that yield high target classification rates in a distributed radar
   environment. A distance measure is derived as an approximation lower
   bound of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two probable
   target classes. A relationship between the KL divergence approximation
   and probability of correct classification (PCC) is demonstrated and used
   to identify sensor placements likely to yield higher PCC values. Two
   algorithms are proposed, optimal and approximate, for identifying good
   placements of a single transmitter and two receivers. A physics-based
   scattering model is employed to generate reflectivity data suitable for
   multi-sensor, multi-static classification analysis. KL and PCC data sets
   are analysed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distance
   measure and algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Various micro-scale surface texturing techniques have been used to
   control surface topography; however, conventional protocols are
   inherently difficult to adapt in large surface area applications.
   Micro-scale material removal methods based on superimposed tool
   modulation offer advantages for overcoming this challenge through
   direct-write processing. In this study, the ability to prescribe
   micro-scale textures of controlled size and morphology by control of
   underlying process parameters in vibration/modulation-assisted machining
   is demonstrated. Novel surface textures including protrusions (ribs and
   fins) and depressions (dimples) were generated, and corresponding
   geometric surface models were developed. The tribological performance of
   dimple-type textures was characterized by lubricated ball-on-flat wear
   testing. The dimple-type surface textures resulted in a substantial
   reduction in wear factor for two material systems, brass and an aluminum
   alloy. The effect of the texturing process on surface and subsurface
   microstructure was measured using electron microscopy. Heterogeneities
   in crystallographic texture and grain size along the textured surface
   were linked to local variations in machining conditions during surface
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the pore structures of ancient Chinese bricks. Two
   building groups consisting of seven ancient masonry buildings were
   examined: the Longmen Temple Group and Songyue Temple Group, both
   located in central China. The brick ages were examined by carbon-14
   isotope measurements, the micro constituents by X-ray fluorescence
   experiments, and the pore structural characteristics by mercury
   intrusion porosimetry and saturation coefficient determination. The pore
   diameter rates of change were measured, calculated and analyzed. From
   the mercury intrusion porosimetry data, a linear relationship between
   the volume change of a sample and its age was determined for pores with
   diameters of 1-5 mu m. The environmental vicissitudes caused the volumes
   of pores whose diameters are less than 1 mu m to decrease and those of
   pores with diameters of 1-5 mu m to increase. The change in the void
   volume as a function of pore size alters the material's original
   porosity. Understanding the mechanics of how the pore structure of
   bricks changes over time sheds light on the relationship between
   material performance and environmental vicissitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging of cellular electric potential via calcium-ion sensitive
   contrast agents is a useful tool, but current techniques lack sufficient
   depth penetration. We explore contrast-enhanced photoacoustic (PA)
   imaging, using Arsenazo III dye, to visualize cardiac myocyte
   depolarization in vitro. Phantom results show strong linearity of PA
   signal with dye concentration (R-2 > 0.95), and agree spectrally with
   extinction measurements with varying calcium concentration. Cell studies
   indicate a significant (>100-fold) increase in PA signal for dye-treated
   cells, as well as a 10-fold increase in peak-to-peak variation during a
   30 s window. This suggests contrast-enhanced PA imaging may have
   sufficient sensitivity and specificity for depth-resolved visualization
   of tissue depolarization in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of this study is to characterize the interfacial
   interactions between silica nanoparticles and polypropylene and to
   investigate how the surface properties and morphology of the silica
   nanoparticles affect the elastic response of the silica-polypropylene
   composites. The composites were prepared by melt compounding and
   injection molding. Both non-functionalized and
   dimethyldichlorosilane-functionalized silica nanoparticles were used.
   Three-component composites were also prepared by including selected
   formulations of both poly(propylene-g-maleic anhydride) copolymer
   (PPgMA) and different types of silica. It was found that both silica
   types are nucleating agents for PP and significantly alter its
   crystallization behavior. A strong correlation between the glass
   transition temperature (T-g) and the tensile modulus in silica-PP
   nanocomposites indicated the presence of a secondary reinforcing
   mechanism that is the pinning of the polymer chains on the silica
   surface. The presence of a complex constrained phase, represented by
   immobilized amorphous and transcrystalline phases, forming at the filler
   surface, was assessed by modulated differential scanning calorimetry and
   dynamic mechanical analysis. Finally, the interfacial interactions were
   correlated to the tensile and viscoelastic properties using the
   theoretical models proposed by Pukanszky and Sumita et al.,
   respectively, and comparing the predictions of the models to
   experimental results. POLYM. COMPOS., 37:2018-2026, 2016. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Among all types of ultraviolet radiation, UVA rays are the most
   prevalent and can penetrate clouds and glass. In this article, we report
   the fabrication of a novel silicone/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite that
   has outstanding performance in shielding the harmful UVA light. We
   prepared wurtzite ZnO nanoparticles of three growth durations and
   dispersed them in a transparent silicone matrix via solution mixing. Our
   results exhibit a red shift in the absorption peak of the nanocomposites
   when compared with ZnO colloidal dispersions and decreasing the growth
   duration of ZnO nanoparticles could improve the UVA-shielding properties
   of the nanocomposite. In addition, the nanocomposite presents good shear
   adhesion strength over 10.5 MPa on glass substrate. The excellent
   optical and mechanical properties of the novel nanocomposite make it
   highly promising for automobile window coatings. POLYM. COMPOS.,

Abstract = {{Motivated by the challenge of developing control software provably
   meeting specifications for real-world problems, this paper applies
   formal methods to adaptive cruise control (ACC). Starting from a linear
   temporal logic specification for ACC, obtained by interpreting relevant
   ACC standards, we discuss in this paper two different control software
   synthesis methods. Each method produces a controller that is
   correct-by-construction, meaning that trajectories of the closed-loop
   systems provably meet the specification. Both methods rely on
   fixed-point computations of certain set-valued mappings. However, one of
   the methods performs these computations on the continuous state space
   whereas the other method operates on a finite-state abstraction. While
   controller synthesis is based on a low-dimensional model, each
   controller is tested on CarSim, an industry-standard vehicle simulator.
   Our results demonstrate several advantages over classical control design
   techniques. First, a formal approach to control design removes potential
   ambiguity in textual specifications by translating them into precise
   mathematical requirements. Second, because the resulting closed-loop
   system is known a priori to satisfy the specification, testing can then
   focus on the validity of the models used in control design and whether
   the specification captures the intended requirements. Finally, the set
   from where the specification (e.g., safety) can be enforced is
   explicitly computed and thus conditions for passing control to an
   emergency controller are clearly defined.}},

Abstract = {{Many systems require a human in the control loop. When the controlled
   system has flexibility, the human can have significant difficulties
   operating the machine. Input-shaping control has been shown to improve
   the control of flexible systems by reducing system vibration. However,
   it may negatively affect the control of the driven base or vehicle that
   the operator is directly controlling. This brief presents a new type of
   input shaper that modifies the operator's command less than traditional
   input shapers, thereby improving the control of the driven base. A
   manual tracking experiment compared the tracking performance and
   subjective difficulty using both the new and traditional input shapers.
   Input shapers generally improved the tracking performance of the
   system's flexible element, and the new input shapers did not
   significantly degrade tracking of the system's driven base.}},

Abstract = {{Electric, thermal, and mechanical strain fields drive the degradation of
   AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). The resulting
   mechanical strains within the devices are particularly important.
   However, a lack of high-resolution measurements of device deformation
   has limited progress in understanding the related phenomena. This paper
   presents the atomic force microscope measurements of thermomechanical
   deformation of AlGaN/GaN HEMT devices during pulsed operation. We
   investigate the devices with various operating conditions: drain-source
   voltage, V-DS, of 0-50 V; drain-source power of 0-6 W/mm; and operating
   frequency of 55-400 kHz. As V-DS increases, thermomechanical deformation
   decreases, especially in the region above the gate. An
   electrothermomechanical model closely matches with and helps to explain
   the measurements. According to the model, the maximum periodic tensile
   thermal stress, which occurs at the drain-side edge of the gate
   footprint, is 55\% larger for V-DS = 10 V than for V-DS = 48 V for the
   same device power. The maximum tensile thermal stress in the device
   depends on the gate temperature and not the maximum device temperature.
   As V-DS increases, the hotspot moves away from the gate, leading to
   lower gate temperature rise and lower tensile thermal stress.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Dietary practices in Kenya often fail to provide adequate
   nutrition during the first 1000 days of life, from conception to 2 years
   of age. We developed and qualitatively assessed the acceptability of
   easy-to-use dietary tools consisting of a marked bowl, slotted spoon and
   illustrated counselling card to support appropriate dietary practices
   during pregnancy, exclusive breast-feeding and complementary feeding of
   children aged 6-24 months.
   Design We conducted qualitative research to assess community
   acceptability and obtain feedback on the design of the dietary tools.
   Setting This research took place in urban and rural communities in
   Western Kenya.
   Subjects We conducted twelve focus group discussions with community
   members (mothers, husbands, mothers-in-law, community leaders) and five
   interviews with government nutritionists to assess acceptability and
   obtain recommendations on design and delivery of the tools. We conducted
   24-28 d of user testing with fourteen pregnant women, fourteen
   breast-feeding women and thirty-two mothers with infants aged 6-18
   months.
   Results Tools were positively received by communities. Mothers perceived
   improvements in their own and their children's food intakes including
   quantity, frequency, consistency and diversity. Many attributed
   perceived own and child's weight gain and/or increased energy to tool
   use. A minority reported using the bowl for other activities (n 9) or
   not using the bowl due to food insecurity (n 5).
   Conclusions Results suggest that such tools have the potential to
   positively impact maternal and child dietary practices. Future work
   should quantitatively assess the impact on diet and nutrition outcomes
   and the underlying behavioural domains associated with changes.}},

   matrix of calcifying cells, which contain matrix processing enzymes and
   regulate the extracellular environment via action of these enzymes. It
   is unknown whether MVs are also exosomic mediators of cell-cell
   communication via transfer of RNA material, and specifically, microRNA
   (miRNA). We investigated the presence of RNA in MVs isolated from
   cultures of costochondral growth zone chondrocytes. Our results showed
   that the average yield of MV RNA was 1.93 +/- 0.78 ng RNA/10(4) cells,
   which was approximately 0.1\% of the parent cell's total RNA. MV RNA was
   well protected from RNase by the lipid membrane and was highly enriched
   in small RNA molecules compared to cells. Moreover, coding and
   non-coding small RNA5 in MVs were in proportions that differed from
   parent cells. Enrichment of specific miRNAs was consistently observed in
   all three miRNA detection platforms that we used, suggesting that miRNAs
   are selectively packaged into MVs. MV-enriched miRNAs were related to
   different signaling pathways associated with bone formation. This study
   suggests a significant role for MVs as ``matrisomes{''} in cell-cell
   communication in cartilage and bone development via transfer of specific
   miRNAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. Allrights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Photovoltaic (PV) Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) estimates are widely
   utilized by decision makers to predict the long-term cost and benefits
   of solar PV installations, but fail to consider local climate, which
   impacts PV panel lifetime and performance. Specific types of solar PV
   panels are known to respond to climate factors differently. Mono-,
   poly-, and amorphous-silicon (Si) PV technologies are known to exhibit
   varying degradation rates and instantaneous power losses as a function
   of operating temperature, humidity, thermal cycling, and panel soiling.
   We formulate an extended LCOE calculation, which considers PV module
   performance and lifespan as a function of local climate. The LCOE is
   then calculated for crystalline and amorphous Si PV technologies across
   several climates. Finally, we assess the impact of various policy
   incentives on reducing the firm's cost of solar deployment when
   controlling for climate. This assessment is the first to quantify
   tradeoffs between technologies, geographies, and policies in a unified
   manner. Results suggest crystalline Si solar panels as the most
   promising candidate for commercial-scale PV systems due to their low
   degradation rates compared to amorphous, technologies. Across
   technologies, we note the strong ability of investment subsidies in
   removing uncertainty and reducing the LCOE, compared to production
   incentives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use the graphical processing unit (GPU) to perform dynamic fracture
   simulation using adaptively refined and coarsened finite elements and
   the inter-element cohesive zone model. Due to the limited memory
   available on the GPU, we created a specialized data structure for
   efficient representation of the evolving mesh given. To achieve maximum
   efficiency, we perform finite element calculation on a nodal basis
   (i.e., by launching one thread per node and collecting contributions
   from neighboring elements) rather than by launching threads per element,
   which requires expensive graph coloring schemes to avoid concurrency
   issues. These developments made possible the parallel adaptive mesh
   refinement and coarsening schemes to systematically change the topology
   of the mesh. We investigate aspects of the parallel implementation
   through microbranching examples, which has been explored experimentally
   and numerically in the literature. First, we use a reduced-scale version
   of the experimental specimen to demonstrate the impact of variation in
   floating point operations on the final fracture pattern. Interestingly,
   the parallel approach adds some randomness into the finite element
   simulation on the structured mesh in a similar way as would be expected
   from a random mesh. Next, we take advantage of the speedup of the
   implementation over a similar serial implementation to simulate a
   specimen whose size matches that of the actual experiment. At this
   scale, we are able to make more direct comparisons to the original
   experiment and find excellent agreement with those results.}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Free-standing 3D carbonaceous materials offer many advantages and
   therefore hold great potential for a wide range of applications.
   However, the synthesis of these materials often involves complicated
   processes that may lead to low yields and high costs. In this study,
   this issue is addressed through developing a facile, scalable, and
   cost-effective synthesis strategy. Nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous
   carbon foam (HP-CF) is fabricated by annealing of soft-template-tasted
   melamine foam, and its application for supercapacitors is highlighted.
   The HP-CF integrates a large number of macropores and micropores, thus
   providing sufficient space for ion transport while offering a large
   amount of surface sites for energy storage, thanks to which the HP-CF
   exhibits a high capacitance of 238 F g(-1) (or 11.9 F cm(-3)). In
   addition, the HP-CF performs greatly when acting as the mechanical
   support for pseudocapacitive materials such as NiCo2S4 and Fe2O3, based
   on which an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, can also be described as
   aqueous battery) is assembled. The ASC exhibits a high energy density of
   93.9 Wh kg(-1) (or 3.55 mWh cm(-3)) and a high power density of 21.1 kW
   kg(-1) (or 799 mW cm(-3)), among the highest reported values for ASCs.

   exposure assessment}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{94-113}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This research is motivated by the need to improve transportation policy
   analysis through the development of a holistic framework to evaluate
   transportation externalities. Traditionally, transportation planning has
   been focused primarily on the improvement of transportation
   infrastructure and network performance and little attention has been
   paid to the resulting externalities that negatively impact public
   health. The paper presents a holistic analysis framework that enables
   policy makers analyze the chain effect of transportation demand on air
   quality and population health exposure. Holism is achieved by
   incorporating the interactions between transportation demand, network
   performance measurement, vehicular emissions, air quality modeling and
   population exposure assessment. The eventual impact of vehicular
   emissions on population is measured through the use of an intake
   fraction metric, which measures the fraction of pollutant inhaled by an
   exposed population over a defined period of time. The proposed framework
   takes advantage of the existing state-of-the-art domain specific models
   so there is no need to re-invent the wheels. Instead, the focus of the
   this research is to provide a prescriptive process of addressing data
   gaps and resolution matching between these models as well as other
   models alike. The proposed population exposure assessment incorporates
   key parameters including different microenvironments and inhalation
   rates not accounted for in the existing literature of exposure
   assessment. The entire framework is evaluated with the three city
   sub-region of Maricopa County in Arizona. Further investigations
   demonstrate the importance of differentiating microenvironments and
   inhalation rates to properly capturing population exposure. (C) 2016

Title = {{Routing aspects of electric vehicle drivers and their effects on network
   performance}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{246-266}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the routing aspects of battery electric vehicle
   (BEV) drivers and their effects on the overall traffic network
   performance. BEVs have unique characteristics such as range limitation,
   long battery recharging time, and recuperation of energy lost during the
   deceleration phase if equipped with regenerative braking system (RBS).
   In addition, the energy consumption rate per unit distance traveled is
   lower at moderate speed than at higher speed. This raises two
   interesting questions: (i) whether these characteristics of BEVs will
   lead to different route selection compared to conventional internal
   combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), and (ii) whether such route
   selection implications of BEVs will affect the network performance. With
   the increasing market penetration of BEVs, these questions are becoming
   more important. This study formulates a multi-class dynamic user
   equilibrium (MCDUE) model to determine the equilibrium flows for mixed
   traffic consisting of BEVs and ICEVs. A simulation-based solution
   procedure is proposed for the MCDUE model. In the MCDUE model, BEVs
   select routes to minimize the generalized cost which includes route
   travel time, energy related costs and range anxiety.cost, and ICEVs to
   minimize route travel time. Results from numerical experiments
   illustrate that BEV drivers select routes with lower speed to conserve
   and recuperate battery energy while ICEV drivers select shortest travel
   time routes. They also illustrate that the differences in route choice
   behavior of BEV and ICEV drivers can synergistically lead to reduction
   in total travel time and the network performance towards system optimum
   under certain conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is developed to analyze a new solar thermochemical
   reactor using liquid metal as a heat transfer fluid. Reaction kinetics
   for both reduction and oxidation in two-step redox cycles using a metal
   oxide are modeled by fitting to experimental data. The transient model
   includes the heat and mass transfer and reaction kinetics for an
   analysis of the efficiency and to elucidate limiting factors. The
   reactor can achieve an efficiency of 20\% for the conversion of thermal
   to chemical energy for our base design. For this design, the removal of
   oxygen during the reduction step was determined to be the bottleneck to
   achieve a higher efficiency. In a sensitivity analysis, the optimal
   reaction temperature can be found considering the trade-off between fast
   reaction kinetics and materials compatibility.}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Examining the way in which animals, including those in captivity,
   interact with their environment is extremely important for studying
   ecological processes and developing sophisticated animal husbandry. Here
   we use the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) to quantify the degree of
   sharing of salivary, skin, and fecal microbiota with their environment
   in captivity. Both species richness and microbial community composition
   of most surfaces in the Komodo dragon's environment are similar to the
   Komodo dragon's salivary and skin microbiota but less similar to the
   stool-associated microbiota. We additionally compared host-environment
   microbiome sharing between captive Komodo dragons and their enclosures,
   humans and pets and their homes, and wild amphibians and their
   environments. We observed similar host-environment microbiome sharing
   patterns among humans and their pets and Komodo dragons, with high
   levels of human/pet- and Komodo dragon-associated microbes on home and
   enclosure surfaces. In contrast, only small amounts of
   amphibian-associated microbes were detected in the animals'
   environments. We suggest that the degree of sharing between the Komodo
   dragon microbiota and its enclosure surfaces has important implications
   for animal health. These animals evolved in the context of constant
   exposure to a complex environmental microbiota, which likely shaped
   their physiological development; in captivity, these animals will not
   receive significant exposure to microbes not already in their enclosure,
   with unknown consequences for their health.
   IMPORTANCE Animals, including humans, have evolved in the context of
   exposure to a variety of microbial organisms present in the environment.
   Only recently have humans, and some animals, begun to spend a
   significant amount of time in enclosed artificial environments, rather
   than in the more natural spaces in which most of evolution took place.
   The consequences of this radical change in lifestyle likely extend to
   the microbes residing in and on our bodies and may have important
   implications for health and disease. A full characterization of
   host-microbe sharing in both closed and open environments will provide
   crucial information that may enable the improvement of health in humans
   and in captive animals, both of which experience a greater incidence of
   disease (including chronic illness) than counterparts living under more
   ecologically natural conditions.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented view
   into cellular heterogeneity, yet they pose new challenges in data
   analysis and interpretation. In this protocol, we describe the use of
   Spanning-tree Progression Analysis of Density-normalized Events (SPADE),
   a density-based algorithm for visualizing single-cell data and enabling
   cellular hierarchy inference among subpopulations of similar cells. It
   was initially developed for flow and mass cytometry single-cell data. We
   describe SPADE's implementation and application using an open-source R
   package that runs on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows systems. A typical
   SPADE analysis on a 2.27-GHz processor laptop takes similar to 5 min. We
   demonstrate the applicability of SPADE to single-cell RNA-seq data. We
   compare SPADE with recently developed single-cell visualization
   approaches based on the t-distribution stochastic neighborhood embedding
   (t-SNE) algorithm. We contrast the implementation and outputs of these
   methods for normal and malignant hematopoietic cells analyzed by mass
   cytometry and provide recommendations for appropriate use. Finally, we
   provide an integrative strategy that combines the strengths of t-SNE and
   SPADE to infer cellular hierarchy from high-dimensional single-cell

Abstract = {{Slot die coating is a pre-metered process commonly used for producing
   thin and uniform films. It is an important film fabrication method for
   applications where precise coating is required. A major concern in slot
   die coating processes is how to determine the operating limits to set
   the appropriate range of operating parameters, including coating speed,
   flow rate, vacuum pressure, coating gap, liquid viscosity and surface
   tension, etc. Operating limits directly determine the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the process. In this article, the current state of
   academic research on operating limits in slot die coating processes is
   reviewed. Specifically, the theories, mechanisms, and empirical
   conclusions related to the limits on vacuum pressure, the low-flow
   limit, the limit of wet thickness for zero-vacuum-pressure cases, the
   limit of dynamic wetting failure, and the limits of coating speed for a
   specific flow rate are reviewed. The article concludes with some
   recommendations for future work. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Increasing availability of micro-computed tomography (A mu CT) as a
   structural imaging gold-standard is bringing unprecedented geometric
   detail to soft tissue modeling. However, the utility of these advances
   is severely hindered without analogous enhancement to the associated
   kinematic detail. To this end, labeling and following discrete points on
   a tissue across various deformation states is a well-established
   approach. Still, existing techniques suffer limitations when applied to
   complex geometries and large deformations and strains. Therefore, we
   herein developed a non-destructive system for applying fiducial markers
   (minimum diameter: 500 A mu m) to soft tissue and tracking them through
   multiple loading conditions by A mu CT. Using a novel applicator to
   minimize adhesive usage, four distinct marker materials were resolvable
   from both tissue and one another, without image artifacts. No impact on
   tissue stiffness was observed. A mu CT addressed accuracy limitations of
   stereophotogrammetry (inter-method positional error 1.2 +/- A 0.3 mm,
   given marker diameter 1.9 +/- A 0.1 mm). Marker application to ovine
   mitral valves revealed leaflet Almansi areal strains (45 +/- A 4\%)
   closely matching literature values, and provided radiographic access to
   previously inaccessible regions, such as the leaflet coaptation zone.
   This system may meaningfully support mechanical characterization of
   numerous tissues or biomaterials, as well as tissue-device interaction
   studies for regulatory standards purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Gram-negative bacteria are distinguished in part by a second, outer
   membrane surrounding them. This membrane is distinct from others,
   possessing an outer leaflet composed not of typical phospholipids but
   rather large, highly charged molecules known as lipopolysaccharides.
   Therefore, modeling the structure and dynamics of proteins embedded in
   the outer membrane requires careful consideration of their native
   environment. In this review, we examine how simulations of such
   outer-membrane proteins have evolved over the last two decades,
   culminating most recently in detailed, highly accurate atomistic models
   of the outer membrane. We also draw attention to how the simulations
   have coupled with experiments to produce novel insights unattainable
   through a single approach. This article is part of a Special Issue
   entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C. Gumbart and Sergei Noskov.

Abstract = {{In this study, the interfacial and mechanical properties of cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNC) coated glass fiber/epoxy composites were investigated
   as a function of the CNC content on the surface of glass fibers (GF).
   Chopped GF rovings were coated with CNC by immersing the GF in CNC (0-5
   wt\%) aqueous suspensions. Single fiber fragmentation (SFF) tests showed
   that the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) increased by similar to 69\%
   in composites produced with CNC coated GF as compared to uncoated GF,
   suggesting an enhancement of stress transfer across the GF/matrix
   interface. The role of CNC coatings on the tensile, flexural, and
   thermo-mechanical properties of the CNC-coated GF/epoxy composites was
   investigated. Incorporation of 0.17 wt\% CNC in the composite resulted
   in increases of similar to 10\% in both elastic modulus and tensile
   strength, and 40 and 43 \% in flexural modulus and strength
   respectively. In conclusion CNC coatings on GF alter the GF/matrix
   interface resulting in improvement of the mechanical performance of the
   corresponding composites.}},

Title = {{Mesh refinement schemes for the concurrent atomistic-continuum method}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{144-152}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Most concurrent multiscale methods that employ domain decomposition
   divide the simulation domain into atomistic and continuum subdomains
   such that nanoscale defects are described at atomistic resolution while
   a continuum treatment is employed elsewhere. An example is the
   concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) method. While dislocations can
   nucleate and migrate in the continuum domain in CAC, they are restricted
   to prescribed slip planes along interelement boundaries. In this paper,
   we extend the original CAC method by implementing mesh refinement
   schemes in a straightforward manner to accommodate a 3-D dislocation
   network and curved dislocation migration. CAC simulation results are
   validated by comparing to their equivalent fully atomistic simulations.
   Augmented with an adaptive mesh refinement scheme, a brittle-to-ductile
   transition in dynamic fracture response of single crystalline FCC Cu is
   accurately predicted using CAC simulations. Differing from most
   multiscale methods, the complexity of the geometric topologies during
   mesh refinement is avoided in this approach because CAC does not require
   interelement compatibility. The extended CAC method is expected to apply
   in multiscale modeling of more complex dislocation activities in
   crystalline materials up to mu m scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{For particular cell-based therapies, it may be required to culture
   mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) aggregates with growth factors to promote
   cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Heparin, a negatively charged
   glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is known to play an important role in
   sequestration of positively charged growth factors and, when
   incorporated within cellular aggregates, could be used to promote local
   availability of growth factors. We have developed a heparin-based cell
   coating and we believe that the electrostatic interaction between native
   heparin and the positively charged growth factors will result in (1)
   higher cell number in response to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and
   2) greater chondrogenic differentiation in response to transforming
   growth factor-1 (TGF-1), compared to a desulfated heparin coating.
   Results revealed that in the presence of FGF-2, by day 14,
   heparin-coated MSC aggregates increased in DNA content 8.5 +/- 1.6 fold
   compared to day 1, which was greater than noncoated and desulfated
   heparin-coated aggregates. In contrast, when cultured in the presence of
   TGF-1, by day 21, desulfated heparin-coated aggregates upregulated gene
   expression of collagen II by 86.5 +/- 7.5 fold and collagen X by 37.1
   +/- 4.7 fold, which was higher than that recorded in the noncoated and
   heparin-coated aggregates. These observations indicate that this coating
   technology represents a versatile platform to design MSC culture systems
   with pairings of GAGs and growth factors that can be tailored to
   overcome specific challenges in scale-up and culture for MSC-based
   therapeutics. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

Abstract = {{Low molecular weight polar organics are commonly observed in spacecraft
   environments. Increasing concentrations of one or more of these
   contaminants can negatively impact Environmental Control and Life
   Support (ECLS) systems and/or the health of crew members, posing
   potential risks to the success of manned space missions. Ambient plasma
   ionization mass spectrometry (MS) is finding effective use as part of
   the analytical methodologies being tested for next-generation space
   module environmental analysis. However, ambient ionization methods
   employing atmospheric plasmas typically require relatively high
   operation voltages and power, thus limiting their applicability in
   combination with fieldable mass spectrometers. In this work, we
   investigate the use of a low power microplasma device in the microhollow
   cathode discharge (MHCD) configuration for the analysis of polar
   organics encountered in space missions. A metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
   structure with molybdenum foil disc electrodes and a mica insulator was
   used to form a 300 mu m diameter plasma discharge cavity. We demonstrate
   the application of these MIM microplasmas as part of a versatile
   miniature ion source for the analysis of typical volatile contaminants
   found in the International Space Station (ISS) environment, highlighting

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-116}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient scheme to filter structures out of
   ground structures, which is implemented using a nested elastic
   formulation for compliance minimization. The approach uses physical
   variables and allows control of the minimum ratio between the minimum
   and maximum areas in the final topology. It leads to a singular problem
   which is solved using a Tikhonov regularization on the structural
   problem (rather than on the optimization problem). The filter allows a
   multiple choice solution in which the user can control the global
   equilibrium residual in the final structural topology and limit
   variations of the objective function between consecutive iterations
   (e.g., compliance). As a result, an unambiguous discrete solution is
   obtained where all the bars that belong to the topology have
   well-defined finite areas. This filter feature, with explicit control of
   member areas, allows the user (e.g., engineer or architect) to play with
   different alternatives prior to selecting a specific structural
   configuration. Examples are provided to illustrate the properties of the
   present approach and the fact that the technique does not always lead to
   a fully stressed design. The method is efficient in the sense that the
   finite element solution is computed on the filtered structure (reduced
   order model) rather than on the full ground structure.}},

Abstract = {{The size of a fracture within a rock mass can be obtained using data
   sampled from boreholes or exposed surfaces. In this study, fracture
   sizes are estimated using data from multiple boreholes. The fractures
   are assumed to be elliptical, all having the same aspect ratio, but not
   necessarily occurring parallel to each other. Formulae for estimating
   the mean and standard deviation of the characteristic fracture size are
   developed by considering the number of intersections between the
   fractures and the boreholes. A method is proposed to infer the
   probability density function of the fracture size from the number of
   fractures, which is obtained by random sampling of fractures in adjacent
   boreholes; the fracture distribution is assumed to follow the form of a
   fractal, exponential, or lognormal distribution. The performance of the
   method is validated using Monte Carlo simulations with different inputs
   of size distribution, fracture density, orientation, and mean fracture
   size. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pigmented coating with high near-infrared reflectance against solar
   irradiation is drawing more and more attention in recent years
   considering both aesthetic and thermal aspects. In this study, a new
   approach of using double-layer pigmented coating with different volume
   fractions of CuO submicron particles is proposed to achieve better
   performance. Comparison of the calculated spectral reflectance of the
   double-layer coating with the uniformly pigmented coating (single layer)
   shows that the double layer coating with a higher volume fraction in the
   upper layer can significantly reflect the solar irradiation especially
   in the near-infrared region while maintaining the same color appearance.
   Furthermore, coatings with different volume fraction distributions,
   thicknesses, particle diameters, as well as substrate conditions are

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The effect of humic acid (HA) or fulvic acid (FA) on reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) generation by six metal-oxide nanoparticles (NPs) and
   their toxicities toward Escherichia coli was investigated under UV
   irradiation. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) decreased (OH)-O-center dot
   generation by TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3, with FA inhibiting (OH)-O-center dot
   generation more than HA. The generated (OH)-O-center dot in NPs/DOM
   mixtures was higher than the measured concentrations because DOM
   consumes (OH)-O-center dot faster than its molecular probe. None of
   NPs/FA mixtures produced O-2(center dot-). The generated O-2(center
   dot-) concentrations in NPs/HA mixtures (except Fe2O3/HA) were higher
   than the sum of O-2(center dot-) concentrations that produced as NPs and
   HA were presented by themselves. Synergistic O-2(center dot-) generation
   in NPs/HA mixtures resulted from O-2 reduction by electron transferred
   from photoionized HA to NPs. DOM increased O-1(2) generation by TiO2,
   CuO, CeO2, and SiO2, and FA promoted O-1(2) generation more than HA.
   Enhanced O-1(2) generation resulted from DOM sensitization of NPs. HA
   did not increase O-1(2) generation by ZnO and Fe2O3 primarily because
   released ions quenched O-1(2) precursor ((3)HA{*}). Linear correlation
   was developed between total ROS concentrations generated by NPs/DOM
   mixtures and bacterial survival rates (R-2 >= 0.80). The results implied
   the necessity of considering DOM when investigating the photoreactivity
   of NPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{72-84}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Photo- and physically realistic techniques are often insufficient for
   visualization of fluid flow simulations, especially for 3D and
   time-varying studies. Substantial research effort has been dedicated to
   the development of non-photorealistic and illustration-inspired
   visualization techniques for compact and intuitive presentation of such
   complex datasets. However, a great deal of work has been reproduced in
   this field, as many research groups have developed specialized
   visualization software. Additionally, interoperability between
   illustrative visualization software is limited due to diverse processing
   and rendering architectures employed in different studies. In this
   investigation, a framework for illustrative visualization is proposed,
   and implemented in MarmotViz, a ParaView plug-in, enabling its use on a
   variety of computing platforms with various data file formats and mesh
   geometries. Region-of-interest identification and feature-tracking
   algorithms incorporated into this tool are described. Implementations of
   multiple illustrative effect algorithms are also presented to
   demonstrate the use and flexibility of this framework. By providing an
   integrated framework for illustrative visualization of CFD data,
   MarmotViz can serve as a valuable asset for the interpretation of
   simulations of ever-growing scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   rural and urban Southeast US}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{95-104}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Measurements of wavelength dependent aerosol light absorption
   coefficients were carried out as part of the Southern Oxidant and
   Aerosol Study (SOAS) during the summer of 2013 to determine the
   contribution of light absorbing organic carbon (BrC) to total aerosol
   light absorption in a rural location (Centreville, AL) and an urban area
   (Atlanta, GA). The light absorption coefficients in the near UV and
   visible wavelengths were measured for both ambient air, as well as
   ambient air heated in a thermal denuder to 200 degrees C to remove the
   semi-volatile organic compounds. Atlanta measurements show dominance of
   semi-volatile brown carbon with an average absorption angstrom exponent
   (AAE) of 1.4 before heating and about 1.0 after heating. In urban
   Atlanta, a decrease of about similar to 35\% in the light absorption
   coefficient at 370 nm after heating indicates that light absorbing
   organic compounds are a substantial fraction of the light absorption
   budget. Furthermore, a considerable increase in the fraction of light
   absorption by the semi-volatile aerosol occurs during the daytime,
   likely linked with photochemistry. Measurements at rural Centerville, on
   the other hand, do not show any major change in AAE with values before
   and after heating of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. Overall the results
   suggest that photochemical aged urban emissions result in the presence
   of light absorbing BrC, while at rural locations which are dominated by
   aged aerosol and local biogenic emissions (based, on measurements of
   Angstrom exponents) BrC does not significantly contribute to light
   absorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{43-52}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a spatially resolved stochastic cluster dynamics (SRSCD)
   model for radiation damage accumulation in metals is implemented using a
   synchronous parallel kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. The parallel
   algorithm is shown to significantly increase the size of representative
   volumes achievable in SRSCD simulations of radiation damage
   accumulation. Weak scaling performance of the method is tested in two
   cases: (1) an idealized case of Frenkel pair diffusion and annihilation,
   and (2) a characteristic example problem including defect cluster
   formation and growth in alpha-Fe. For the latter case, weak scaling is
   tested using both Frenkel pair and displacement cascade damage. To
   improve scaling of simulations with cascade damage, an explicit cascade
   implantation scheme is developed for cases in which fast-moving defects
   are created in displacement cascades. For the first time, simulation of
   radiation damage accumulation in nanopolycrystals can be achieved with a
   three dimensional rendition of the microstructure, allowing
   demonstration of the effect of grain size on defect accumulation in
   Frenkel pair-irradiated alpha-Fe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A paradigm for higher-order polygonal elements in finite elasticity
   using a gradient correction scheme}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{216-251}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated that polygonal elements possess great
   potential in the study of nonlinear elastic materials under finite
   deformations. On the one hand, these elements are well suited to model
   complex microstructures (e.g. particulate microstructures and
   microstructures involving different length scales) and incorporating
   periodic boundary conditions. On the other hand, polygonal elements are
   found to be more tolerant to large localized deformations than the
   standard finite elements, and to produce more accurate results in
   bending and shear. With mixed formulations, lower order mixed polygonal
   elements are also shown to be numerically stable on Voronoi-type meshes
   without any additional stabilization treatment. However, polygonal
   elements generally suffer from persistent consistency errors under mesh
   refinement with the commonly used numerical integration schemes. As a
   result, non-convergent finite element results typically occur, which
   severely limit their applications. In this work, a general gradient
   correction scheme is adopted that restores the polynomial consistency by
   adding a minimal perturbation to the gradient of the displacement field.
   With the correction scheme, the recovery of optimal convergence for
   solutions of displacement-based and mixed formulations with both linear
   and quadratic displacement interpolants is confirmed by numerical
   studies of several boundary value problems in finite elasticity. In
   addition, for mixed polygonal elements, the various choices of the
   pressure field approximations are discussed, and their performance on
   stability and accuracy are numerically investigated. We present
   applications of those elements in physically-based examples including a
   study of filled elastomers with interphasial effect and a qualitative
   comparison with cavitation experiments for fiber reinforced elastomers.

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The compressive response of sandwich plates with polyvinyl chloride
   (PVC) foam cores and aluminum facesheets to water-based impulsive
   loading is analyzed using an instrumented impulsive loading apparatus
   called the underwater shock loading simulator (USLS) and a fully-dynamic
   3-D computational framework. The loading conditions analyzed are similar
   to those in underwater blasts. The study focuses on the overall
   deformation, strain recovery and impulse transmission which are
   quantified as functions of structural attributes such as core density,
   front and backface masses, and incident impulsive load intensity.
   Measurements obtained using high-speed digital imaging and pressure and
   force sensors allow the computational models to be calibrated and
   verified. Quantitative loading-structure-performance maps are developed
   between the response variables and structural and load attributes. The
   results reveal that core density has the most pronounced influence on
   core compressive strain and impulse transmission. Specifically, for
   severe impulse intensities, a 100\% increase in core density leads to a
   200\% decrease in compressive strain and a 500\% increase in normalized
   transmitted impulse. On the other hand, structures with low density
   cores are susceptible to collapse at high impulse intensities.
   Additionally, the compressive strains and transmitted impulses increase
   monotonically as the mass of the frontface increases, but are unaffected
   by backface mass. For the same core density, a 100\% increase in
   facesheet thickness leads to a 25\% and 50\% increase in the core strain
   and normalized transmitted impulse, respectively. The results and
   performance maps are useful for designing marine structures with
   restricts, such as hull sections and pipelines backed by water or
   machinery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a general framework for determining the effect of
   communication delays on the convergence of certain distributed frequency
   regulation (DFR) protocols for prosumer-based energy systems, where
   prosumers are serving as balancing areas. DFR relies on iterative and
   distributed optimization algorithms to obtain an optimal feedback law
   for frequency regulation. But, it is, in general, hard to know
   beforehand how many iterations suffice to ensure stability. This paper
   develops a framework to determine a lower bound on the number of
   iterations required for two distributed optimization protocols. This
   allows prosumers to determine whether they can compute stabilizing
   control strategies within an acceptable time frame by taking
   communication delays into account. The efficacy of the method is
   demonstrated on two realistic power systems.}},

Abstract = {{A Pickering emulsion liquid membrane (PELM) stabilized by oleic
   acid-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles has been prepared and used to extract
   phenolic compound from wastewater. Compared to traditional emulsion
   liquid membrane (ELM), nano-Fe3O4 particle-stabilized PELM can be easily
   demulsified after extraction under magnetic field, which could greatly
   improve the reutilization of oil phase and reduce the energy consumption
   of ELM operation. Practically, our PELM contains tri-n-butyl phosphate
   as a carrier, corn oil as a liquid membrane, and sodium hydroxide as a
   stripping agent. The stability of Pickering emulsion was investigated
   under different homogenization speeds and characterized by centrifugal
   stability method. Reutilization of emulsifier and oil phase exhibited
   comparable extraction efficiency after three cycles of remediation, and
   no significant change on the particle property was observed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent IAEA circulars and policy papers have sought to implement
   safeguards when any purified aqueous uranium solution or uranium oxides
   suitable for isotopic enrichment or fuel fabrication exists. Under the
   revised policy, IAEA Policy Paper 18, the starting point for nuclear
   material under safeguards was reinterpreted, suggesting that purified
   uranium compounds should be subject to safeguards procedures no later
   than the first point in the conversion process. In response to this
   technical need, a combination of simulation models and experimental
   measurements were employed to develop and validate concepts of
   nondestructive assay monitoring systems in a natural uranium conversion
   plant (NUCP). In particular, uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)(2)) solution
   exiting solvent extraction was identified as a key measurement point
   (KMP), where gamma-ray spectroscopy was selected as the process
   monitoring tool. The Uranyl Nitrate Calibration Loop Equipment (UNCLE)
   facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was employed to simulate the
   full-scale operating conditions of a purified uranium-bearing aqueous
   stream exiting the solvent extraction process in an NUCP. Nondestructive
   assay techniques using gamma-ray spectroscopy were evaluated to
   determine their viability as a technical means for drawing safeguards
   conclusions at NUCP5, and if the IAEA detection requirements of 1
   significant quantity (SQ) can be met in a timely way. This work
   investigated gamma-ray signatures of uranyl nitrate circulating in the
   UNCLE facility and evaluated various gamma-ray detector sensitivities to
   uranyl nitrate. These detector validation activities include assessing
   detector responses to the uranyl nitrate gamma-ray signatures for
   spectrometers based on sodium iodide, lanthanum bromide, and high-purity
   germanium detectors. The results of measurements under static and
   dynamic operating conditions at concentrations ranging from 10-90 g U/L
   of natural uranyl nitrate are presented. A range of gamma-ray lines is
   examined, including attenuation for transmission measurement of density
   and concentration. It was determined that transmission-corrected
   gamma-ray spectra provide a reliable way to monitor the U-235
   concentration of uranyl nitrate solution in transfer pipes in NUCP5.
   Furthermore, existing predictive and analysis methods are adequate to
   design and realize practical designs. The Cs-137 transmission source
   employed in this work is viable but not optimal for U-235 densitometry
   determination. Validated simulations assessed the viability of Ba-133
   and Co-57 as alternative densitometry sources. All three gamma-ray
   detectors are viable for monitoring natural uranium feed; although
   high-purity germanium is easiest to interpret, it is, however, the least
   attractive as an installation instrument. Overall, for monitoring
   throughput in a facility such as UNCLE, emulating the uranium
   concentration and pump speeds of the Springflelds conversion facility in
   the United Kingdom, an uncertainty of less than 0.17\% is required in
   order to detect the diversion of 1 SQ of uranyl nitrate through changes
   in uranium concentration over an accountancy period of one year with a
   detection probability of 50\%. Although calibrated gamma-ray detection
   systems are capable of determining the concentration of uranium content
   in NUCPs, it is only in combination with verifiable operator
   declarations and supporting data, such as flow rate and enrichment, that
   safeguards conclusions can be drawn. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on the interaction of
   ultrasonic guided waves with delamination in the web-flange interface of
   a co-cured, co-bonded composite T-joint. A complex interaction of waves
   is induced, first, by one, and, later, by two piezoceramic wafer(s)
   bonded on the inner surface of the flange. The flange surface velocity
   distributions are reconstructed from the scanning laser Doppler
   velocimeter (LDV) measurements to study the effect of a delamination
   overlapping the web-flange interface. The surface-bonded piezoelectric
   actuator(s) placed remotely on the flange produce primarily
   anti-symmetric wave incidence to the delamination. A two-stage wave mode
   conversion process, one due to the web and joint filler, and the other
   due to the delamination underneath the flange is observed. First, we
   address the problem of identification of delamination by ultrasonic
   contrast imaging of the web-flange interface using a single actuator.
   This study is extended further to enhance the ultrasonic contrast
   imaging at the web-flange interface using a standing wave. A
   quantitative methodology based on mode conversion strength is developed
   to monitor different structural features like free-edge, web-flange
   interface and delamination. The results show the complex nature of the
   conversion of flexural waves to in-plane waves through the deltoid and
   along the web-flange interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we implement the first comprehensive quantification of
   the perfect de-anonymizability and partial de-anonymizability of
   real-world social networks with seed information under general
   scenarios, which provides the theoretical foundation for the existing
   structure-based de-anonymization attacks and closes the gap between
   de-anonymization practice and theory. Based on our quantification, we
   conduct a large-scale evaluation of the de-anonymizability of 24
   real-world social networks by quantitatively showing the conditions for
   perfectly and partially de-anonymizing a social network, how
   de-anonymizable a social network is, and how many users of a social
   network can be successfully de-anonymized. Furthermore, we show that
   both theoretically and experimentally, the overall structural
   information-based de-anonymization attack can be more powerful than the
   seed-based de-anonymization attack, and even without any seed
   information, a social network can be perfectly or partially
   de-anonymized. Finally, we discuss the implications of this paper. Our
   findings are expected to shed on research questions in the areas of
   structural data anonymization and de-anonymization and to help data
   owners evaluate their structural data vulnerability before data sharing
   and publishing.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in studying biological systems in natural
   settings, in which experimental stimuli are less artificial and behavior
   is less controlled. In primate vision research, free viewing of complex
   images has elucidated novel neural responses, and free viewing in humans
   has helped discover attentional and behavioral impairments in patients
   with neurological disorders. In order to fully interpret data collected
   from free viewing of complex scenes, it is critical to better understand
   what aspects of the stimuli guide viewing behavior. To this end, we have
   developed a novel viewing behavior model called a Biased Correlated
   Random Walk (BCRW) to describe free viewing behavior during the
   exploration of complex scenes in monkeys. The BCRW can predict fixation
   locations better than bottom-up salience. Additionally, we show that the
   BCRW can be used to test hypotheses regarding specific attentional
   mechanisms. For example, we used the BCRW to examine the source of the
   central bias in fixation locations. Our analyses suggest that the
   central bias may be caused by a natural tendency to reorient the eyes
   toward the center of the stimulus, rather than a photographer's bias to
   center salient items in a scene. Taken together these data suggest that
   the BCRW can be used to further our understanding of viewing behavior
   and attention, and could be useful in optimizing stimulus and task
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Sputter deposition of the thin film memristor material, lithium niobite

   investigated resulting in variations in the deposition rate, film
   crystallinity, oxygen to niobium ratio, and mean niobium oxidation

   large area LiNbO2 films at low substrate temperature useful in

Abstract = {{A novel design of liquid catalyzed fuel cell (LCFC), which uses
   polyoxometalates (POMs) as the photo catalyst and charge carrier has
   been reported previously. In this paper, the adaptability of biomass
   fuels (e.g., glycerol and glucose) to the LCFC and corresponding cell
   performance were studied in detail here. An interesting finding that
   greatly differs from conventional fuel cell is that high molecular
   weight fuels rather than small molecule fuels (e.g., methanol and
   ethylene glycol) are favored by the novel LCFC with respect to the power
   densities. The power output of LCFC strongly depends on the number and
   structure of hydroxyl groups in the biomass fuels. The evidence of
   UV-Vis and H-1 NMR spectra shows that the preassociation between POM and
   alcohol fuels, which determines the photoelectrochemical reaction
   pathway of POM, is enhanced as the number of hydroxyl increases.
   Experimental results also demonstrate that more hydroxyl groups in the
   molecules lead to faster photoelectrochemical reaction between POM and
   fuels, higher reduction degree of POM, and further higher power output
   of LCFC. Our study reveals that biomass-based polyhydroxyl compounds
   such as starch, hemicellulose and cellulose are potential
   high-performance fuels for LCFC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We demonstrate significantly enhanced conversion and selectivity in
   high-temperature propane dehydrogenation (PDH) membrane reactors via the
   synthesis and use of small-pore SAPO-34 zeolite membranes. The reduction
   of SAPO-34 membrane thickness to similar to 1 mu m levels while
   maintaining good H-2 selectivity is challenging. Initial reductions in
   membrane thickness were achieved using a single structure-directing
   agent (SDA) and concentrated precursor solution, leading to a large
   permeance increase and good H-2/hydrocarbon selectivity. We further show
   that thinner (similar to 1 mu m) SAPO-34 membranes can be fabricated on
   a large area (similar to 18 cm(2)) tubular ceramic supports by the use
   of both base and salt forms of the SDA to independently control the SDA
   concentration and pH. EDX analysis and elemental mapping confirmed the
   formation of micrometer-thin (similar to 1 mu m) SAPO-34 zeolite
   membrane layers on alpha-alumina tubular supports. Micrometer-thin
   SAPO-34 membranes reach propylene selectivities greater than 80\% as
   well as high propane conversions (65-75\% at weight hourly space
   velocities of 0.1-0.5 h(-1)), because of their efficient removal of
   hydrogen generated in the PDH reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Emissions from 15 agricultural fires in the southeastern U.S. were
   measured from the NASA DC-8 research aircraft during the summer 2013
   Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate
   Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS) campaign. This study reports a
   detailed set of emission factors (EFs) for 25 trace gases and 6 fine
   particle species. The chemical evolution of the primary emissions in
   seven plumes was examined in detail for similar to 1.2 h. A Lagrangian
   plume cross-section model was used to simulate the evolution of ozone
   (O-3), reactive nitrogen species, and organic aerosol (OA). Observed EFs
   are generally consistent with previous measurements of crop residue
   burning, but the fires studied here emitted high amounts of SO2 and fine
   particles, especially primary OA and chloride. Filter-based measurements
   of aerosol light absorption implied that brown carbon (BrC) was
   ubiquitous in the plumes. In aged plumes, rapid production of O3,
   peroxyacetyl nitrate ( PAN), and nitrate was observed with Delta
   O-3/Delta CO,Delta PAN/Delta NOy, and Delta nitrate/Delta NOy reaching
   similar to 0.1,similar to 0.3,and similar to 0.3. For five selected
   cases, the model reasonably simulated O3 formation but underestimated
   PAN formation. No significant evolution of OA mass or BrC absorption was
   observed. However, a consistent increase in oxygen-to-carbon (O/C)
   ratios of OA indicated that OA oxidation in the agricultural fire plumes
   was much faster than in urban and forest fire plumes. Finally, total
   annual SO2, NOx, and CO emissions from agricultural fires in Arkansas,
   Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri were estimated (within a factor of
   similar to 2) to be equivalent to similar to 2\% SO2 from coal
   combustion and similar to 1\% NOx and similar to 9\% CO from mobile
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{Superconducting magnets enable precise control of nuclear and electron
   spins, and are used in experiments that explore biological and
   condensed-matter systems, and fundamental atomic particles. In
   high-precision applications, a common view is that slow (<1 Hz) drift of

   We report on previously undocumented higher-frequency field noise
   (10-200 Hz) that limits the coherence time of Be-9(+) electron-spin
   qubits in the 4.46-T field of a superconducting magnet. We measure a
   spin-echo T-2 coherence time of similar to 6 ms for the Be-9(+)
   electron-spin resonance at 124 GHz, limited by part-per-billion
   fractional fluctuations in the magnet's homogeneous field. Vibration
   isolation of the magnet improved T-2 to similar to 50 ms.}},

   impedance. The results show heat treatment RGO has high graphitization
   degree, less surface oxygen-containing groups, good charge-discharge
   efficiency and stable life cycle. The chemical reduced RGO has
   single-graphene structure, high specific surface area, high specific
   capacitance and low internal resistance. The ascorbic acid reduction RGO
   exhibits good comprehensive electrochemical performance: Its specific

Abstract = {{Generation of entropy and transfer of heat during forced convection of a
   nanofluid through a partially filled porous channel are investigated
   theoretically. The problem includes a fully developed flow in a channel
   with a central porous insert and under constant heat flux boundary
   condition. The system is assumed to be under local thermal
   non-equilibrium and the solid and nanofluid phases can feature internal
   heat generations. Darcy-Brinkman model of momentum transfer along with
   the two-equation thermal energy transport and two different fundamental
   porous-fluid interface models are utilised to analyse the heat transfer
   problem. Analytical expressions are developed for the temperature
   fields, Nusselt number and, the local and total entropy generations. The
   subsequent parametric study reveals the strong influences of the
   pertinent parameters and the utilised porous-nanofluid interface models.
   In keeping with others, the results show considerable increases in the
   Nusselt number with increasing the concentration of nanoparticles.
   Internal heat generations are demonstrated to have major effects on the
   heat transfer and entropy generation characterises of the system.
   Further, the existence of internal heat sources signifies the role of
   nanoparticles concentration in the thermal and entropic behaviours of
   the system. It is, also, shown that the choice of the porous-nanofluid
   interface model can significantly alter the predictions of the local and
   total entropy generations within the system. This appears to be,
   particularly, the case at low Biot numbers for which the system is
   significantly away from the local thermal equilibrium condition. (C)

Title = {{Trehalose upregulates progranulin expression in human and mouse models
   of GRN haploinsufficiency: a novel therapeutic lead to treat
   frontotemporal dementia}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Progranulin (PGRN) is a secreted growth factor important for
   neuronal survival and may do so, in part, by regulating lysosome
   homeostasis. Mutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) are a common cause of
   frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and lead to disease through
   PGRN haploinsufficiency. Additionally, complete loss of PGRN in humans
   leads to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage
   disease. Importantly, Grn(-/-) mouse models recapitulate pathogenic
   lysosomal features of NCL. Further, GRN variants that decrease PGRN
   expression increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   Parkinson's disease (PD). Together these findings demonstrate that
   insufficient PGRN predisposes neurons to degeneration. Therefore,
   compounds that increase PGRN levels are potential therapeutics for
   multiple neurodegenerative diseases.
   Results: Here, we performed a cell-based screen of a library of known
   autophagy-lysosome modulators and identified multiple novel activators
   of a human GRN promoter reporter including several common mTOR
   inhibitors and an mTOR-independent activator of autophagy, trehalose.
   Secondary cellular screens identified trehalose, a natural disaccharide,
   as the most promising lead compound because it increased endogenous PGRN
   in all cell lines tested and has multiple reported neuroprotective
   properties. Trehalose dose-dependently increased GRN mRNA as well as
   intracellular and secreted PGRN in both mouse and human cell lines and
   this effect was independent of the transcription factor EB (TFEB).
   Moreover, trehalose rescued PGRN deficiency in human fibroblasts and
   neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated
   from GRN mutation carriers. Finally, oral administration of trehalose to
   Grn haploinsufficient mice significantly increased PGRN expression in
   the brain.
   Conclusions: This work reports several novel autophagy-lysosome
   modulators that enhance PGRN expression and identifies trehalose as a
   promising therapeutic for raising PGRN levels to treat multiple
   neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Title = {{A Fit-Fat Index for Predicting Incident Diabetes in Apparently Healthy
   Men: A Prospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of combined
   cardiorespiratory fitness and waist-to-height ratio in the form of a
   fit-fat index on incident diabetes risk. Additionally, the independent
   predictive performance of cardiorespiratory fitness, waist-to-height
   ratio, and body mass index also were estimated and compared.
   Methods
   This was a prospective cohort study of 10,381 men who had a normal
   electrocardiogram and no history of major chronic disease at baseline
   from 1979 to 2005. Random survival forest models and traditional Cox
   proportional hazards models were used to predict diabetes at 5-, 10-,
   and 15-year incidence horizons.
   Results
   Overall, 4.8\% of the participants developed diabetes. Receiver
   operating characteristic curve analyses for incidence risk demonstrated
   good discrimination using random survival forest models across fitness
   and fatness measures; Cox models were poor to fair. The differences
   between fitness and fatness measures across horizons were clinically
   negligible. Smoothed random survival forest estimates demonstrated the
   impact of each fitness and fatness measure on incident diabetes was
   intuitive and graded.
   Conclusions
   Although fitness and fatness measures showed a similar discriminative
   ability in predicting incident diabetes, unique to the study was the
   ability of the fit-fat index to demonstrate a better indication of
   incident risk when compared to fitness or fatness alone. A single index
   combining cardiorespiratory fitness and waist-to-height ratio may be
   more useful because it can indicate improvements in either or both of
   the measures.}},

Title = {{Bubble Meets Droplet: Particle-Assisted Reconfiguration of Wetting
   Morphologies in Colloidal Multiphase Systems}},

Abstract = {{Wetting phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and play key functions in
   various industrial processes and products. When a gas bubble encounters
   an oil droplet in an aqueous medium, it can experience either partial
   wetting or complete engulfment by the oil. Each of these morphologies
   can have practical benefits, and controlling the morphology is desirable
   for applications ranging from particle synthesis to oil recovery and gas
   flotation. It is known that the wetting of two fluids within a fluid
   medium depends on the balance of interfacial tensions and can thus be
   modified with surfactant additives. It is reported that colloidal
   particles, too, can be used to promote both wetting and dewetting in
   multifluid systems. This study demonstrates the surfactant-free tuning
   and dynamic reconfiguration of bubble-droplet morphologies with the help
   of cellulosic particles. It further shows that the effect can be
   attributed to particle adsorption at the fluid interfaces, which can be
   probed by interfacial tensiometry, making particle-induced transitions
   in the wetting morphology predictable. Finally, particle adsorption at
   different rates to air-water and oil-water interfaces can even lead to
   slow, reentrant wetting behavior not familiar from particle-free
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{We probe the energetic landscape at a model pentacene/fullerene (C-60)
   interface to investigate the interactions between positive and negative
   charges, which are critical to the processes of charge separation and
   recombination in organic solar cells. Using a polarizable force field,
   we find that polarization energy, i.e., the stabilization a charge feels
   due to its environment, is larger at the interface than in the bulk for
   both a positive and a negative charge. The combination of the charge
   being more stabilized at the interface and the Coulomb attraction
   between the charges results in a barrier to charge separation at the
   pentacene/C-60 interface that can be in excess of 0.7 eV for static
   configurations of the donor and acceptor locations. However, the impact
   of molecular motions, i.e., the dynamics, at the interface at room
   temperature results in a distribution of polarization energies and in
   charge separation barriers that can be significantly reduced. The
   dynamic nature of the interface is thus critical, with the polarization
   energy distributions indicating that sites along the interface shift in
   time between favorable and unfavorable configurations for charge
   separation.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of modern electronics and three-dimensional
   integration sets stringent requirements for efficient heat removal of
   thermal-management materials to ensure the long lifetime of the
   electronics. However, conventional polymer composites that have been
   used widely as thermal-management materials suffer from undesired
   thermal conductivity lower than 10 W m(-1) K-1. In this work, we report
   a novel thermally conductive composite paper based on the thought of
   bioinspired engineering. The advantage of the bioinspired papers over
   conventional composites lies in that they possess a very high in-plane
   thermal conductivity up to 21.7 W m(-1) K-1. along with good mechanical
   properties and high electrical insulation. We attribute the high thermal
   conductivity to the improved interfacial interaction between assembled
   components through the introduction of silver nanoparticles and the
   oriented structure based on boron nitride nanosheets and silicon carbide
   nanowires. This thought based on bioinspired engineering provides a
   creative opportunity for design and fabrication of novel thermally
   conductive materials, and this kind of composite paper has potential
   applications in powerful integrated microelectronics.}},

Title = {{Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Aldol Condensation Catalyzed by
   Alkylamine-Functionalized Crystalline Silica Surfaces}},

Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the
   cooperatively catalyzed aldol condensation between acetone and
   4-nitrobenzaldehyde on alkylamine (or alkylenamine)-grafted silica
   surfaces, focusing on the mechanism of the catalytic activation of the
   acetone and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde by the acidic surface silanols followed
   by the nucleophilic attack of the basic amine functional group toward
   the activated reactant. From the analysis of the correlations between
   the catalytically active acid base sites and reactants, it is concluded
   that the catalytic cooperativity of the acid base pair can be affected
   by two factors: (1) the competition between the silanol and the amine
   (or enamine) to form a hydrogen bond with a reactant and (2) the
   flexibility of the alkylamine (or alkylenamine) backbone. Increasing the
   flexibility of the alkylamine facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the
   amine on the reactants. From the molecular dynamics simulations, it is
   found that C3 propylamine and C4 butylamine linkers exhibit the highest
   probability of reaction, which is consistent with the experimental
   observation that the activity of the aldol reaction on mesoporous silica
   depends on the length of alkylamine grafted on the silica surface. This
   simulation work serves as a pioneering study demonstrating how the
   molecular simulation approach can be successfully employed to
   investigate the cooperative catalytic activity of such bifunctional acid
   base catalysts.}},

   Programming DNA-origami tiles to form large-scale 2D lattices that span

Abstract = {{Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as indium tin oxide and zinc
   oxide, play an important role as electrode materials in
   organic-semiconductor devices. The properties of the inorganic organic
   interface the offset between the TCO Fermi level and the relevant
   transport level, the extent to which the organic semiconductor can wet
   the oxide surface, and the influence of the surface on semiconductor
   morphology significantly affect device performance. This review surveys
   the literature on TCO modification with phosphonic acids (PAs), which
   has increasingly been used to engineer these interfacial properties. The
   first part outlines the relevance of TCO surface modification to organic
   electronics, surveys methods for the synthesis of PAs, discusses the
   modes by which they can bind to TCO surfaces, and compares PAs to
   alternative organic surface modifiers. The next section discusses
   methods of PA monolayer deposition, the kinetics of monolayer formation,
   and structural evidence regarding molecular orientation on TCOs. The
   next sections discuss TCO work-function modification using PAs, tuning
   of TCO surface energy using PAs, and initiation of polymerizations from
   TCO-tethered PAs. Finally, studies that examine the use of PA-modified
   TCOs in organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaics are
   compared.}},

Abstract = {{A hypersonic vehicle traveling at a high speed disrupts the distribution
   of internal states in the ambient flow and introduces a nonequilibrium
   distribution in the post-shock conditions. We investigate the
   vibrational relaxation in diatom-atom collisions in the range of
   temperatures between 1000 and 10 000 K by comparing results of extensive
   fully quantum-mechanical and quasi-classical simulations with available
   experimental data. The present paper simulates the interaction of
   molecular oxygen with argon as the first step in developing the
   aerothermodynamics models based on first principles. We devise a routine
   to standardize such calculations also for other scattering systems. Our
   results demonstrate very good agreement of vibrational relaxation time,
   derived from quantum-mechanical calculations with the experimental
   measurements conducted in shock tube facilities. At the same time, the
   quasi-classical simulations fail to accurately predict rates of
   vibrationally inelastic transitions at temperatures lower than 3000 K.
   This observation and the computational cost of adopted methods suggest
   that the next generation of high fidelity thermochemical models should
   be a combination of quantum and quasi-classical approaches. Published by
   AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Selective dissolution of perovskite A site (A of ABO(3) structure) was
   performed on the La1-xSrxCoO3 catalysts for the NOx storage and
   reduction (NSR) reaction. The surface area of the catalysts were
   enhanced using dilute HNO3 impregnation to dissolve Sr. Inactive SrCO3
   was removed effectively within 6 h, and the catalyst preserved the
   perovskite framework after 24 h of treatment. The tuned catalysts
   exhibited higher NSR performance (both NOx storage and NO-to-NO2
   oxidation) under lean-burn and fuel-rich cycles at 250 degrees C. Large
   amounts of NOx adsorption were due to the increase of nitrate/nitrite
   species bonding to the A site and the growth of newly formed monodentate
   nitrate species. Nitrate species were stored stably on the partial
   exposed Sr2+ cations. These exposed Sr2+ cations played an important
   role on the NOx reduction by C3H6. High NO-to-NO2 oxidation ability was
   due to the generation of oxygen defects and Co2+-Co3+ redox couples,
   which resulted from B-site exsolution induced by A-site dissolution.
   Hence, our method is facile to modify the surface structures of
   perovskite catalysts and provides a new strategy to obtain highly active
   catalysts for the NSR reaction.}},

Abstract = {{The hyaluronan-rich pericellular matrix (PCM) plays physical and
   chemical roles in biological processes ranging from brain plasticity, to
   adhesion-dependent phenomena such as cell migration, to the onset of
   cancer. This study investigates how the spatial distribution of the
   large negatively charged bottlebrush proteoglycan, aggrecan, impacts PCM
   morphology and cell surface access. The highly localized pericellular
   milieu limits transport of nanoparticles in a size-dependent fashion and
   sequesters positively charged molecules on the highly sulfated side
   chains of aggrecan. Both rat chondrocyte and human mesenchymal stem cell
   PCMs possess many unused binding sites for aggrecan, showing a 2.5x
   increase in PCM thickness from similar to 7 to similar to 18 mu m when
   provided exogenous aggrecan. Yet, full extension of the PCM occurs well
   below aggrecan saturation. Hence, cells equipped with hyaluronan-rich
   PCM can in principle manipulate surface accessibility or sequestration
   of molecules by tuning the bottlebrush proteoglycan content to alter PCM
   porosity and the number of electrostatic binding sites.}},

Abstract = {{In the quest for cheap and earth abundant but highly effective and
   energy efficient water splitting catalysts, manganese oxide represents
   one of the materials of choice. In the framework of a new hierarchical
   modeling strategy we employ free non-ligated manganese oxide clusters
   MnxOx+y + (x = 2-5, y = -1, 0, 1, 2) as simplified molecular models to
   probe the interaction of water with nano-scale manganese oxide
   materials. Infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectroscopy
   in conjunction with first-principles spin density functional theory
   calculations is applied to study several series of MnxOx+y(H2O)(n)(+)
   complexes and reveal that the reaction of water with MnxOx+y + leads to
   the deprotonation of the water molecules via hydroxylation of the
   cluster oxo-bridges. This process is independent of the formal Mn
   oxidation state and occurs already for the first adsorbed water molecule
   and it proceeds until all oxo-bridges are hydroxylated. Additional water
   molecules are bound intact and favorably form H3O2 units with the
   hydroxylated oxo-bridges. Water adsorption and deprotonation is also
   found to induce structural transformations of the cluster core,
   including dimensionality crossover. Furthermore, the IR-MPD measurements
   reveal that clusters with one oxygen atom in excess MnxOx+1 + contain a
   terminal O atom while clusters with two oxygen atoms in excess MnxOx+2 +
   contain an intact O-2 molecule which, however, dissociates upon
   adsorption of a minimum number of water molecules. These basic concepts
   could aid the future design of artificial water-splitting molecular
   catalysts.}},

   instability}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Since the 1990s, the modulational instability has commonly been used to
   explain the occurrence of rogue waves that appear from nowhere in the
   open ocean. However, the importance of this instability in the context
   of ocean waves is not well established. This mechanism has been
   successfully studied in laboratory experiments and in mathematical
   studies, but there is no consensus on what actually takes place in the
   ocean. In this work, we question the oceanic relevance of this paradigm.
   In particular, we analyze several sets of field data in various European
   locations with various tools, and find that the main generation
   mechanism for rogue waves is the constructive interference of elementary
   waves enhanced by second-order bound nonlinearities and not the
   modulational instability. This implies that rogue waves are likely to be
   rare occurrences of weakly nonlinear random seas.}},

Abstract = {{The active centers of the nitrogen-fixing enzymes nitrogenases comprise
   iron-sulfur clusters. The binding of the substrate N-2 to these clusters
   plays a fundamental role for the subsequent ammonia synthesis. However,
   due to the complexity of the natural system and the lack of suitable
   synthetic models, the interaction of N-2 with the iron sulfur clusters
   remains largely elusive. In this contribution, we demonstrate the
   gas-phase preparation and investigation of the cationic Fe2S2+, Fe3S3+,
   and Fe4S4+ clusters. These clusters represent the first cluster model
   systems containing more than one iron and sulfur atom, respectively,
   which are found to bind N-2. Temperature-dependent kinetic measurements
   allow, for the first time, for the determination of experimental binding
   energies of N-2 to iron-sulfur clusters. In addition, concurrent first
   principles simulations reveal the ground state and isomeric structures
   of the iron-sulfur clusters with and without adsorbed N-2 and provide a
   conceptual understanding of the interaction between N-2 and iron-sulfur
   clusters. In particular, we present molecular level details of N-2
   bonding such as the identification of the adsorption sites, the bond
   geometry, the bond strength, and the nature of the cluster-N-2 binding
   interaction, which is found to be promoted by Occupation of the empty
   antibonding orbitals of the free N-2 molecule through interaction with
   the frontier orbitals of the iron-sulfur complex involving d-orbitals of
   iron hybridized with sulfur p-orbitals.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal geologic records allow for the assessment of long-term patterns
   of tropical cyclone variability. However, the accuracy of geologic
   reconstructions of tropical cyclones is limited by the lack of modern
   analogues. We describe the microfossil (foraminifera and testate
   amoebae) assemblages contained within overwash sediments deposited by
   Typhoon Haiyan when it made landfall on the islands of Leyte and Samar
   in the Philippines on 7 November 2013 as a Category 5 super typhoon. The
   overwash sediments were transported up to 1.7 km inland at four study
   sites. The sediments consisted of light brown medium sand in a layer <1
   to 8 cm thick. We used Partitioning Around a Medoid (PAM) cluster
   analysis to identify lateral and vertical changes in the foraminiferal
   and testate amoebae data. The presence of intertidal and subtidal
   benthic, and planktic foraminifera that were variably unaltered and
   abraded identify the microfossil signature of the overwash sediments.
   Agglutinated mangrove foraminifera and testate amoebae were present
   within the overwash sediments at many locations and indicate terrestrial
   scouring by Haiyan's storm surge. PAM cluster analysis subdivided the
   Haiyan microfossil dataset into two assemblages based on depositional
   environment: (1) a low-energy mixed-carbonate tidal flat located on
   Samar Island (Basey transect); and (2) a higher-energy clastic coastline
   near Tanauan on Leyte Island (Santa Cruz, Solano, and Magay transects).
   The assemblages and the taphonomy suggest a mixed provenance, including
   intertidal and subtidal sources, as well as a contribution of sediment
   sourced from deeper water and terrestrial environments. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Nanoporous alumina membranes are filled with multiwalled carbon
   nanotubes (MWENTs) and then poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) melt,
   resulting in nanofibers with nanoconfinement induced coalignment of both
   MWCNT and polymer chains. The simple sonication process proposed here
   can achieve vertically aligned arrays of P3HT/MWCNT composite nanofibers
   with 3 wt \% to 55 wt \% MWCNT content, measured using thermogravimetric
   methods. Electrical and thermal transport in the composite nanofibers
   improves drastically with increasing carbon nanotube content where
   nanofiber thermal conductivity peaks at 4.7 +/- 1.1 Wm(-1)K(-1) for 24
   wt \% MWCNT and electrical percolation occurs once 20 wt \% MWCNT
   content is surpassed. This is the first report of the thermal
   conductivity of template fabricated composite nanofibers and the first
   proposed processing technique to enable template fabrication of
   composite nanofibers with high filler content and long aspect ratio
   fillers, where enhanced properties can also be realized on the
   macroscale due to vertical alignment of the nanofibers. These materials
   are interesting for thermal management applications due to their high
   thermal conductivity and temperature stability.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are nanoporous
   materials that exhibit continuous and controllable tunability of
   properties like effective pore size, hydrophobicity, and
   organophilicity. The structure of mixed linker ZIFs has been studied on
   macroscopic scales using gravimetric and spectroscopic techniques.
   However, it has so far not been possible to obtain information on
   unit-cell-level linker distribution, an understanding of which is key to
   predicting and controlling their adsorption and diffusion properties. We
   demonstrate the use of H-1 combined rotation and multiple pulse
   spectroscopy (CRAMPS) NMR spin exchange measurements in combination with
   computational modeling to elucidate potential structures of mixed-linker
   ZIFs, particularly the ZIF 8-90 series. All of the compositions studied
   have structures that have linkers mixed at a unit-cell-level as opposed
   to separated or highly clustered phases within the same crystal. Direct
   experimental observations of linker mixing were accomplished by
   measuring the proton spin exchange behavior between functional groups on
   the linkers. The data were then fitted to a kinetic spin exchange model
   using proton positions from candidate mixed-linker ZIF structures that
   were generated computationally using the short-range order (SRO)
   parameter as a measure of the ordering, clustering, or randomization of
   the linkers. The present method offers the advantages of sensitivity
   without requiring isotope enrichment, a straightforward NMR pulse
   sequence, and an analysis framework that allows one to relate spin
   diffusion behavior to proposed atomic positions. We find that structures
   close to equimolar composition of the two linkers show a greater
   tendency for linker clustering than what would be predicted based on
   random models. Using computational modeling we have also shown how the
   window-type distribution in experimentally synthesized mixed-linker
   ZIF-8-90 materials varies as a function of their composition. The
   structural information thus obtained can be further used for predicting,
   screening, or understanding the tunable adsorption and diffusion
   behavior of mixed-linker ZIFs, for which the knowledge of linker
   distributions in the framework is expected to be important.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructurally small crack (MSC) growth strongly depends on local
   microstructure and often displays oscillatory character in terms of

   fatigue indicator parameter (FIP)-based MSC growth model is presented
   for high temperature MSC growth in polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy
   IN100 that takes into account crack tip/grain boundary interaction. An
   expression for FIP evolution is evoked based on a sequence of finite
   element simulations for stationary cracks. The MSC growth model was fit
   to experiments within the context of a simple 1D crack growth model and
   then applied to model 3D crack growth from a simulated focused ion beam
   (FIB) notch. Simulations showed that the MSC growth rate became less
   oscillatory as the MSC front sampled more grains, and eventually
   converged to the LEFM response with further crack extension. Published

Abstract = {{The stress-strain fields realized in spherical indentation tests are
   highly heterogeneous, and present a significant challenge to the
   recovery of bulk stress-strain responses such as those measured in
   simple compression tests performed on samples with a uniform cross
   section in the gauge section. In this paper, we critically explore the
   correlations between indentation stress-strain curves and the simple
   compression stress-strain curves using the finite element model of
   indentation as a surrogate for the actual experiment. The central
   advantage of using a finite element model is that it allows us to
   critically explore the sensitivity of various assumptions or values of
   parameters or other choices made in the analyses protocols on the
   extracted results. Based on this study, a general protocol has been
   established to reliably recover the uniaxial stress-strain response
   directly from the indentation stress-strain curve for isotropic
   elastic-plastic materials. The protocols developed are validated for a
   range of hardening behaviors. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Interdiffusion cross the interface between metallic glass CuZr and
   crystal Al is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. We show
   that the interdiffusivity is highly asymmetric in the adjacent amorphous
   and crystal phases and strongly concentration dependent Anomalous
   interdiffusion is observed in the interdiffusion zone grown from the
   initial interface. The underlying mechanisms of the mass transport
   phenomenon in the heterogeneous media involve interplay of simultaneous
   structural transformation from crystal to amorphous and then to liquid
   phase with subtle changes in local atomic bonding and packing and the
   difference in the intrinsic diffusivity of the alloy elements. The
   complexity is a natural consequence of the heterostructure evolving

Title = {{Robust optimal design of district cooling systems and the impacts of
   uncertainty and reliability}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainty exists widely in the design of district cooling systems. Due
   to failures or improper maintenance of components or subsystems, the
   cooling systems may malfunction or work with reduced performance. In the
   conventional design method of district cooling systems, both aspects are
   often ignored or considered roughly. To ensure that district cooling
   systems achieve the expected performance as closely as possible, a
   robust optimization method is proposed in this paper. This approach
   relies on quantifying the uncertainty at the design stage and the
   reliability of the cooling system in operation. By taking the total
   annual cost (including the capital cost, operation cost and availability
   risk cost) as the objective, the robust optimal design of district
   cooling systems can be obtained. Uncertainties in weather, building
   design/construction and indoor conditions are considered and
   reliabilities of major equipment in the systems are dealt with as well.
   Individual cooling systems are often alternative to district cooling
   systems while uncertainty and reliability issues also exist at the
   design stage. The role of uncertainty and reliability in the design of
   district cooling systems and individual cooling systems are assessed and
   compared. Results show that both uncertainty and reliability have
   greater impacts on the design of individual cooling systems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We present the systematic design, fabrication, and characterization of a
   multiplexed label-free lab-on-a chip biosensor using silicon nitride
   (SiN) microring resonators. Sensor design is addressed through a
   systematic approach that enables optimizing the sensor according to the
   specific noise characteristics of the setup. We find that an optimal 6
   dB undercoupled resonator consumes 40\% less power in our platform to
   achieve the same limit-of-detection as the conventional designs using
   critically coupled resonators that have the maximum light-matter
   interaction. We lay out an optimization framework that enables the
   generalization of our method for any type of optical resonator and noise
   characteristics. The device is fabricated using a CMOS-compatible
   process, and an efficient swabbing lift-off technique is introduced for
   the deposition of the protective oxide layer. This technique increases
   the lift-off quality and yield compared to common lift-off methods based
   on agitation. The complete sensor system, including microfluidic flow
   cell and surface functionalization with glycan receptors, is tested for
   the multiplexed detection of Aleuria Aurantia Lectin (AAL) and Sambucus
   Nigra Lectin (SNA). Further analysis shows that the sensor limit of
   detection is 2 x 10(-6) RIU for bulk refractive index, 1 pg/mm(2) for
   surface-adsorbed mass, and similar to 10 pM for the glycan/lectins
   studied here. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since being introduced to the open literature in 2010, the isoindigo
   heterocycle has been extensively studied as a novel electron-deficient
   building block for organic electronic materials in conjugated polymers,
   discrete length oligomers, and molecular systems, particularly targeting
   high charge mobility values and ambipolar transport in organic field
   effect transistors, along with high power conversion efficiencies in
   organic photovoltaic devices. This article introduces results obtained
   on copolymers of isoindigo with thiophene and alkylated terthiophenes to
   highlight fundamental characteristics in isoindigo-based polymers and
   the resulting organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaic devices.
   By comparing and contrasting the optoelectronic properties, thin film
   morphology, organic field-effect transistor (OFET) mobilities, and
   organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance to previously reported polymers,
   structure processing-property relationships were uncovered. In
   particular, isoindigo-containing polymers with more rigid backbones and
   higher coherence lengths in thin films lead to increased charge mobility
   in OFET devices. In OPV devices, efficiencies over 6\% can be obtained
   by balancing high ionization potentials typically dictating the
   open-circuit voltage and the charge transfer energy, and blend
   morphology impacting short-circuit currents. Furthermore, the impact of
   polymer structure on solubility and on phase separation in blends with
   PC71M is discussed, with isoindigo-based polymers exhibiting lower
   solubility possibly leading to more fiber-like morphologies stemming,
   either from polymer dissolution in the casting solvent or from polymer
   self-assembly during film formation. This fiber-like polymer morphology
   remains unaffected by the presence of processing additives, such as
   1,8-diiodooctane. These structure property relationships developed for
   isoindigo-based polymers can also be discussed in the broader context of
   diketo-pyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thienoisoindigo (TiI) as
   electron-deficient moieties that can also be doubly substituted on their
   amide functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Long-range ordering emerges in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) solutions
   during time-dependent aggregation. Here, aggregation of P3HT in
   chloroform solution was induced by ultrasonication, aging, and
   combinations thereof. UV-vis spectroscopy and polarized optical
   microscopy demonstrated that long-range ordering in the solution and
   subsequently the solid state depends on assembled P3HT fiber length, as
   determined by film atomic force microscopy. Ultrasonication induced the
   formation of fibers that were relatively short compared to those
   obtained through aging. As a result, ultrasonication afforded isotropic
   solutions and films, whereas aging afforded anisotropic solutions and
   films. The impact of fiber length and anisotropy on macroscopic charge
   transport performance was evaluated using an organic field-effect
   transistor (OFET) architecture. Both aged and sonicated solutions
   exhibited charge carrier mobilities that were an order of magnitude
   higher than that obtained for pristine samples. Aging of sonicated
   solutions enabled semiconducting thin films with significantly higher
   mobilities (1.5 X 10(-1) cm(2)V(-1) s(-1)) than those of either solution
   processing technique. Furthermore, the results indicate that grain
   boundary morphology has a significant impact on macroscopic charge
   carrier mobility. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
   demonstrated that the combined sonication/aging method affords a
   solidified film where the semiconductor exhibits a highly edge-on
   orientation. The results suggest that the nucleation and growth of
   aggregates can be controlled via solution processing methods and thus
   may allow the manipulation of active layer orientation, crystal packing
   density, and crystallite size. The investigation provides insight into
   the conjugated polymer solution process parameters that impact polymer
   ordering and aggregation in solution and resultant thin films for
   high-performance organic electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Recent spherical nanoindentation protocols have proven robust at
   capturing the local elastic-plastic response of polycrystalline metal
   samples at length scales much smaller than the grain size. In this work,
   we extend these protocols to length scales that include multiple grains
   to recover microindentation stress-strain curves. These new protocols
   are first established in this paper and then demonstrated for Al-6061 by
   comparing the measured indentation stress-strain curves with the
   corresponding measurements from uniaxial tension tests. More
   specifically, the scaling factors between the uniaxial yield strength
   and the indentation yield strength was determined to be about 1.9, which
   is significantly lower than the value of 2.8 used commonly in
   literature. The reasons for this difference are discussed. Second, the
   benefits of these new protocols in facilitating high throughput
   exploration of process-property relationships are demonstrated through a
   simple case study.}},

Abstract = {{Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
   disease, affecting bone metabolism, structure and strength. Current bone
   assessment methods are not ideal. Semi-quantitative MRI scoring is
   unreliable, not standardized, and only evaluates bone marrow. DXA BMD is
   also used but is a limited predictor of bone fragility/fracture risk.
   Our purpose was to measure trabecular bone micro architecture, as a
   biomarker of bone disease severity, in type 1 GD individuals with
   different GD genotypes and to apply machine learning based analytics to
   discriminate between GD patients and healthy individuals. Micro-MR
   imaging of the distal radius was performed on 20 type 1 GD patients and
   10 healthy controls (HC). Fifteen stereological and textural measures
   (STM) were calculated from the MR images. General linear models
   demonstrated significant differences between GD and HC, and GD
   genotypes. Stereological measures, main contributors to the first two
   principal components (PCs), explained similar to 50\% of data variation
   and were significantly different between males and females. Subsequent
   PCs textural measures were significantly different between GD patients
   and HC individuals. Textural measures also significantly differed
   between GD genotypes, and distinguished between GD patients with normal
   and pathologic DXA scores. PCA and SVM predictive analyses discriminated
   between GD and HC with maximum accuracy of 73\% and area under ROC curve
   of 0.79. Trabecular STM differences can be quantified between GD
   patients and HC, and GD sub-types using micro-MRI and machine learning
   based analytics. Work is underway to expand this approach to evaluate GD
   disease burden and treatment efficacy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of surface morphology on the local piezoelectric response
   of highly (100)-textured 0.70PbMg(2/3)Nb(1/3)O(3)-0.30PbTiO(3) thin
   films is studied using piezoresponse force microscopy in band-excitation
   mode. The local electromechanical response is mostly suppressed in
   direct proximity of the grain boundaries. However, within 100-200 nm of
   the grain boundary, the piezoresponse is substantially enhanced, before
   decaying again within a region at the center of the grain itself. Nested
   piezoresponse hysteresis curves confirm the influence of topography
   descriptors on parameters affecting the hysteresis loop shape. The
   enhancement of the electromechanical response is rationalized through
   reduced lateral clamping in the grains with deep trenched boundaries, as
   well as an expected lower energy for complex domain wall structures, due
   to curved ferroelectric surfaces. The lower piezoresponse at the center
   of the grain is assigned to the lateral clamping by the surrounding
   piezoelectric material. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We report the computational discovery and experimental evaluation of
   nanoporous materials targeted at the adsorptive separation of p-xylene
   from a C-8 aromatics mixture. We first introduce a computational method
   that is capable of efficiently predicting the p-xylene selectivities and
   capacities for a large database of porous materials. We then demonstrate
   the application of this method to screen a database of several thousand
   metal-organic framework (MOF) structures. Our computational screening
   methodology predicted that two MOFs with good solvothermal stability and
   commercially-available linkers give comparable performance to the
   state-of-the-art zeolite BaX currently used in industrial p-xylene
   separations. The best-performing MOFs are then synthesized, and their
   xylene separation characteristics are evaluated in detail through
   breakthrough adsorption experiments and modeling. We find that the
   selectivities obtained in these materials are higher than that of any
   MOF previously reported in the literature and in some cases exceed the
   measured performance of zeolite BaX. In the case of the p-xylene
   selective material MOF-48, we use calculated free energy profiles to
   show how the presence of methyl substituents on the linkers allows the
   inversion of selectivity from the equivalent MOF with no methyl
   substituents (MIL-47, which is o-xylene selective). This combined
   computational and experimental-methodology is a useful step in the
   development of MOFs for separation of aromatic hydrocarbons and can also
   be applied to other chemical separations and other classes of porous
   materials as long as the appropriate intermolecular force fields are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin yttrium-stabilized-zirconia
   (YSZ) electrolyte supported on composite anode of nickel-iron bimetal
   and YSZ are prepared and operated directly on Fe-loaded activated carbon
   fuel, without any liquid medium or purging gas. The composition of the
   anode is represented as Ni1-xFexO delta (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,
   0.3)-YSZ. Experiment result shows that such kind of all-solid-state
   direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells (DC-SOFCs) perform well at 800
   degrees C, giving maximum output power densities in the range of 425-529
   mW cm(-2). Similar to the case of a SOFC operated on hydrogen fuel, a
   small amount of Fe addition into the Ni-based anode can improve the
   performance of a DC-SOFC and the optimum composition is x = 0.1. A
   DC-SOFC with Ni0.9Fe0.1O delta-YSZ anode, loaded with 2.5 g Fe-loaded
   activated carbon fuel, is steadily operated at a constant current
   density of 0.1 A cm(-2) for 15 h at 800 degrees C. The anodes and the
   DC-SOPCs are characterized through XRD, AC impedance spectroscopy, and
   SEM measurements. The superior performance of the Fe-added anode is
   analyzed accordingly. (c) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Abstract = {{Thermally reduced graphene oxide (RGO) electrochemically activated by a
   quaternary alkyl ammonium based organic electrolytes/activated carbon
   (AC) electrode asymmetric capacitor is proposed. The electrochemical
   activation process includes adsorption of anions into the pores of AC in
   the positive electrode and the interlayer intercalation of cations' into
   RGO in the negative electrode under high potential (4.0 V). The EA
   process of RGO by quaternary alkyl ammonium was investigated by X-ray
   diffraction and electrochemical measurements, and the effects of cation
   size and structure were extensively evaluated:, Intercalation by
   quaternary alkyl ammonium demonstrates a small degree of expansion of
   the whole crystal lattice (don) and a large degree of expansion of the
   partial crystal lattice (don) of RGO. RGO electrochemically activated by
   bis-spiro quaternary alkyl ammonium in propylene carbonate/AC asymmetric
   capacitor exhibits good activated efficiency, high specific capacity,
   and stable cyclability.}},

Abstract = {{The polarizable environment surrounding charge carriers in organic
   semiconductors impacts the efficiency of the charge, transport process.
   Here, we consider two representative organic semiconductors, tetracene
   and rubrene, and evaluate their polarization energies in the bulk and at
   the organic-vacuum interface using a polarizable force field that.
   -accounts for induced-dipole and quadrupole interactions. Though both
   oligoacenes pack in a herringbone motif; the tetraphenyl substituents on
   the tetracene backbone of rubrene alter greatly the nature of the
   packing. The resulting change in relative orientations of neighboring
   Molecules is found to reduce the bulk polarization energy of holes in
   rubrene by some 0.3 eV when compared to tetracene. The consideration of
   model organic-vacuum interfaces highlights,the significant variation in
   the electrostatic environment for a charge carrier at a surface although
   the net change in polarization energy is small; interestingly) the
   environment of a Charge:even just one layer removed from the surface can
   be viewed already as representative of the bulk. Overall). it is found
   that in these herringbone-type layered crystals the polarization energy
   has a much stronger dependence on the intralayer packing density than
   interlayer packing density.}},

   maintained ammonia adsorption capacity under dry conditions. An almost
   2-fold increase in humid ammonia capacity was observed for the
   UiO-66:MMO composite, far beyond that expected through a linear
   combination of the two materials capacities. The synergistic effect
   observed in humid conditions was further investigated with water

Abstract = {{Exploiting synergistic cooperation between multiple sources of optical
   nonlinearity, we report the design, synthesis, and nonlinear optical
   properties of a series of electron-rich thiophene-containing donor
   acceptor chromophores with condensed pi-systems and sterically regulated
   inter-aryl twist angles. These structures couple two key mechanisms
   underlying optical nonlinearity, namely, (i) intramolecular charge
   transfer, greatly enhanced by increased electron density and reduced
   aromaticity at chromophore thiophene rings and (ii) a twisted
   chromophore geometry, producing a manifold of close-lying excited states
   and dipole moment changes between ground and excited states that are
   nearly twice that of untwisted systems. Spectroscopic, electrochemical,
   and nonlinear Z-scan measurements, combined with quantum chemical
   calculations, illuminate relationships between molecular structure and
   mechanisms of enhancement of the nonlinear refractive index. Experiment
   and calculations together reveal ground-state structures that are
   strongly responsive to the solvent polarity, leading to substantial
   negative solvatochromism (Delta lambda approximate to 10(2) nm) and
   prevailing zwitterionic/aromatic structures in the solid state and in
   polar solvents. Ground to-excited-state energy gaps below 2.0 eV are
   obtained in condensed pi-systems, with lower energy gaps for twisted
   versus untwisted systems. The real part of the second
   hyperpolarizability in the twisted structures is much greater than the
   imaginary part, with the highest twist angle chromophore giving vertical
   bar Re(gamma)/Im(gamma)vertical bar approximate to 100, making such
   chromophores very promising for all-optical-switching applications.}},

   flexible/stretchable electronics, organic optoelectronics, and wearable
   electronics. Progress in nanogenerators for mechanical energy harvesting
   is reviewed, mainly including two key technologies: flexible
   piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and flexible triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs). By means of material classification, various
   approaches of PENGs based on ZnO nanowires, lead zirconate titanate
   (PZT), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 2D materials, and composite
   materials are introduced. For flexible TENG, its structural designs and
   factors determining its output performance are discussed, as well as its

Abstract = {{All-solid-state lithium batteries are attractive candidates for
   next-generation energy storage devices because of their anticipated high
   energy density and intrinsic safety. Owing to their excellent ionic
   conductivity and stability with metallic lithium anodes, nanostructured
   lithium thiophosphate solid electrolytes such as beta-Li3PS4 have found
   use in the fabrication of all-solid lithium batteries for large-scale
   energy storage systems. However, current methods for preparing
   air-sensitive solid electrolyte membranes of lithium thiophosphates can
   only generate thick membranes that compromise the battery's
   gravimetric/volumetric energy density and thus its rate performance. To
   overcome this limitation, the solid electrolyte's thickness needs to be
   effectively decreased to achieve ideal energy density and enhanced rate
   performance. Herein, we show that the evaporation-induced self-assembly
   (EISA) technique produces ultrathin membranes of a lithium thiophosphate
   solid electrolyte with controllable thicknesses between 8 and 50 pin
   while maintaining the high ionic conductivity of beta-Li3PS4 and
   stability with metallic lithium anodes up to 5 V. It is clearly
   demonstrated that this facile EISA approach allows for the preparation
   of ultrathin lithium thiophosphate solid electrolyte membranes for
   all-solid-state batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation of nanoparticles impacts their reactivity, stability,
   transport, and fate in aqueous environments, but limited methods are
   available to characterize structural features and movement of aggregates
   in liquid. Here, liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM)
   was utilized to directly observe the size, morphology, and motion of
   aggregates that were composed of 9 and 36 nm hematite nanoparticles,
   respectively, in water or NaCl solution. When mass concentrations were
   same, the aggregates of 9 nm nanoparticles were statistically more
   compact and slightly larger than those of 36 nm nanoparticles.
   Aggregates in both samples were typically nonspherical. Increasing ionic
   strength resulted in larger aggregates, and also enhanced the stability
   of aggregates under electron-beam irradiation. In water, small
   aggregates moved randomly and approached repeatedly to large aggregates
   before final attachment. In NaC1 solution, small aggregates moved
   directly toward large aggregates and attached to the latter quickly.
   This observation provided a direct confirmation of the DLVO theory that
   the energy barrier to aggregation is higher in water than in salt
   solutions. This study not only presented the influences of particle size
   and ionic strength on aggregation state, but also demonstrated that
   LCTEM is a promising method to link aggregation state to dynamic

Abstract = {{Hydrophobins are amphiphilic proteins produced by fungi. Cerato-ulmin
   (CU) is a hydrophobin that has been associated with Dutch elm disease.
   Like other hydrophobins, CU stabilizes air bubbles and oil droplets
   through the formation of a persistent protein film at the interface. The
   behavior of hydrophobins at surfaces has raised interest in their
   potential applications, including use in surface coatings, food foams,
   and emulsions and as dispersants. The practical use of hydrophobins
   requires an improved understanding of the interfacial behavior of these
   proteins, alone and in the presence of added surfactants. In this study,
   the adsorption behavior of CU at air/water interfaces is characterized
   by measuring the surface tension and interfacial theology as a function
   of adsorption time. CU is found to adsorb irreversibly at air/water
   interfaces. The magnitude of the dilatational modulus increases with
   adsorption time and surface pressure until CU eventually forms a rigid
   film. The persistence of this film is tested through the sequential
   addition of strong surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the bulk
   liquid adjacent to the interface. SDS is found to coadsorb to interfaces
   precoated with a CU film. At high concentrations, the addition of SDS
   significantly decreases the dilatational modulus, indicating disruption
   and displacement of CU by SDS. Sequential adsorption results in mixed
   layers with properties not observed in interfaces generated from
   complexes formed in the bulk. These results lend insight to the complex
   interfacial interactions between hydrophobins and surfactants.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{A porous artery structure utilizing the concept of ``phase separation
   and modulation{''} is proposed to enhance the critical heat flux of pool
   boiling. A series of experiments were conducted on a range of test
   articles in which multiple rectangular arteries were machined directly
   into the top surface of a 10.0mm diameter copper rod. The arteries were
   then covered by a 2.0mm thickness microporous copper plate through
   silver brazing. The pool wall was fabricated from transparent Pyrex
   glass to allow a visualization study, and water was used as the working
   fluid. Experimental results confirmed that the porous artery structure
   provided individual flow paths for the liquid supply and vapor venting,
   and avoided the detrimental effects of the liquid/vapor counter flow. As
   a result, a maximum heat flux of 610 W/cm(2) over a heating area of 0.78
   cm(2) was achieved with no indication of dryout, prior to reaching the
   heater design temperature limit. Following the experimental tests, the
   mechanisms responsible for the boiling critical heat flux and
   performance enhancement of the porous artery structure were analyzed.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and demonstration of a compact
   packaged prototype of a single effect ammonia-water absorption cooling
   system with a nominal cooling capacity of 3.5 kW. The packaged unit
   encompasses a combustion module to supply thermal energy to the system
   where heat is exchanged between combusted gas and a heat transfer fluid.
   The heat transfer fluid provides heat to the desorber where refrigerant
   is generated. The heat and mass exchange components of the absorption
   system are integrated into two monolithic blocks. The sub-components of
   each monolith utilize micro scale heat and mass transfer passages, which
   have higher heat and mass transfer coefficients compared to conventional
   designs, resulting in substantial reductions in the required size of the
   system. Semi-autonomous control algorithms are developed to enable
   stand-alone operation of the packaged unit. System performance is
   measured over a range of operating conditions and compared with
   predictions of the corresponding system model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Characterization of osteoarthritic human knees indicates potential sex
   differences}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY OF SEX DIFFERENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of osteoarthritis is higher in women than in
   men in every age group, and overall prevalence increases with advancing
   age. Sex-specific differences in the properties of osteoarthritic joint
   tissues may permit the development of sex-specific therapies. Sex
   hormones regulate cartilage and bone development and homeostasis in a
   sex-dependent manner. Recent in vitro studies show that the vitamin D-3
   metabolite 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 {[}1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3] also
   has sex-specific effects on musculoskeletal cells, suggesting that
   vitamin D-3 metabolites may play a role in osteoarthritis-related
   sex-specific differences. The purpose of this study was to determine if
   sex-specific differences exist in synovial fluid and knee tissues
   isolated from male and female patients with severe knee osteoarthritis.
   We determined the presence of vitamin D-3 metabolites, inflammatory
   cytokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in
   synovial fluid and assessed responses of articular chondrocytes and
   subchondral osteoblasts to 17 beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, and 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3.
   Methods: Samples from knee joints of 10 Caucasian male and 10 Caucasian
   female patients with advanced osteoarthritis aged 65 to 75 years were
   obtained from total knee arthroplasty. Vitamin D metabolites, cytokines,
   MMPs, and growth factors in the synovial fluid were measured. Primary
   cultures of chondrocytes were isolated from fibrillated articular
   cartilage adjacent to osteoarthritis lesions and minimally affected
   cartilage distal to the lesion. Osteoblasts were isolated from the
   subchondral bone. Expression of receptors for 17 beta-estradiol and 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 was assessed by real-time PCR. Chondrocytes and
   osteoblasts were treated with 10(-8) M 17 beta-estradiol,
   dihydrotestosterone, or 1a, 25(OH) 2D3 and effects on gene expression
   and protein synthesis determined.
   Results: Histology of the articular cartilage confirmed advanced
   osteoarthritis. Sex differences were found in synovial fluid levels of
   vitamin D metabolites, cytokines, and metalloproteinases as well as in
   the cellular expression of receptors for 17 beta-estradiol and 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. Male cells were more responsive to 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 and dihydrotestosterone, whereas 17
   beta-estradiol-affected female cells.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that there are underlying sex
   differences in knee tissues affected by osteoarthritis. Our findings do
   not address osteoarthritis etiology but have implications for different
   prevention methods and treatments for men and women. Further research is
   needed to better understand these sex-based differences.}},

Abstract = {{Seed-mediated growth has emerged as an effective approach to the
   synthesis of noble-metal nanocrystals with well-controlled sizes,
   shapes, compositions, and structures. Although surface capping is known
   to affect the growth pattern of a seed, its explicit role remains to be
   fully understood. In this article, we applied the collision model
   established for surface science to seed-mediated growth of nanocrystals
   in an effort to account for the heterogeneous nucleation of atoms on the
   surface of a seed and thus the growth pattern in the presence or absence
   of a surface capping agent. Using Pd cubic seeds as a model system, we
   demonstrated that the heterogeneous nucleation of Pd atoms only occurred
   at the corner and edge sites when the \{100\} side faces were
   selectively passivated by chemisorbed Br- ions. In comparison, the Pd
   atoms were found to randomly nucleate on the entire surface of similar
   Pd seeds if the Br- ions were removed from the surface in advance. For a
   1:1 mixture of Br--capped and Br--free Pd cubic seeds, more atoms were
   added onto the Br--free seeds due to the involvement of a much larger
   bare surface with a higher sticking coefficient. In addition, we found
   that the growth mode (island vs layer-by-layer) of a seed was also
   highly sensitive to the surface condition and could be altered by
   manipulating the rate of surface diffusion. We further extended the
   collision model to account for the growth behavior of other types of
   seeds whose surfaces were enclosed by a mix of \{111\} and \{100\}
   facets in different proportions or characterized by different internal
   structures, including Pd cuboctahedra and pentatwinned nanowires. The
   mechanistic insights from this study clearly demonstrate the role played
   by a surface capping agent in determining the sticking coefficient of
   atoms and the morphology taken by nanocrystals in a seed-mediated
   synthesis and should be extendable to other systems involving different
   types or combinations of metals.}},

Abstract = {{The singular optimal control problem for asymptotic stabilisation has
   been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, the optimal
   singular control problem is extended to address a weaker version of
   closed-loop stability, namely, semistability, which is of paramount
   importance for consensus control of network dynamical systems. Three
   approaches are presented to address the nonlinear semistable singular
   control problem. Namely, a singular perturbation method is presented to
   construct a state-feedback singular controller that guarantees
   closed-loop semistability for nonlinear systems. In this approach, we
   show that for a non-negative cost-to-go function the minimum cost of a
   nonlinear semistabilising singular controller is lower than the minimum
   cost of a singular controller that guarantees asymptotic stability of
   the closed-loop system. In the second approach, we solve the nonlinear
   semistable singular control problem by using the cost-to-go function to
   cancel the singularities in the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
   equation. For this case, we show that the minimum value of the singular
   performance measure is zero. Finally, we provide a framework based on
   the concepts of state-feedback linearisation and feedback equivalence to
   solve the singular control problem for semistabilisation of nonlinear
   dynamical systems. For this approach, we also show that the minimum
   value of the singular performance measure is zero. Three numerical
   examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   singular semistabilisation frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle force can be transmitted to the skeleton, not only via
   its tendons of origin and insertion but also through connective tissues
   linking the muscle belly to surrounding structures. Through such
   epimuscular myofascial connections, length changes of a muscle may cause
   length changes within an adjacent muscle and hence, affect muscle
   spindles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of
   epimuscular myofascial forces on feedback from muscle spindles in
   triceps surae muscles of the rat. We hypothesized that within an intact
   muscle compartment, muscle spindles not only signal length changes of
   the muscle in which they are located but can also sense length changes
   that occur as a result of changing the length of synergistic muscles.
   Action potentials from single afferents were measured intra-axonally in
   response to ramp-hold release (RHR) stretches of an agonistic muscle at
   different lengths of its synergist, as well as in response to synergist
   RHRs. A decrease in force threshold was found for both soleus (SO) and
   lateral gastrocnemius afferents, along with an increase in length
   threshold for SO afferents. In addition, muscle spindle firing could be
   evoked by RHRs of the synergistic muscle. We conclude that muscle
   spindles not only signal length changes of the muscle in which they are
   located but also local length changes that occur as a result of changing
   the length and relative position of synergistic muscles.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis, prognosis, and management of patients with gliomas are
   largely dictated by the pathological analysis of tissue biopsied from a
   selected region within the lesion. However, the heterogeneous and
   infiltrative nature of gliomas make it difficult to identify the optimal
   region for biopsy with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   This is particularly true for low-grade gliomas, which are often
   nonenhancing tumors. To improve the management of patients with such
   tumors, neuro-oncology requires an imaging modality that can
   specifically identify a tumor's most anaplastic/aggressive region(s) for
   biopsy targeting. The addition of metabolic mapping using spectroscopic
   MRI (sMRI) to supplement conventional MRI could improve biopsy targeting
   and, ultimately, diagnostic accuracy. Here, we describe a pipeline for
   the integration of state-of-the-art, high-resolution, whole-brain
   3-dimensional sMRI maps into a stereotactic neuronavigation system for
   guiding biopsies in gliomas with nonenhancing components. We also
   outline a machine-learning method for automated histological analysis
   that generates normalized, quantitative metrics describing tumor
   infiltration in immunohistochemically stained tissue specimens. As a
   proof of concept, we describe the combination of these 2 techniques in a
   small cohort of patients with grade 3 glioma. With this work, we aim to
   present a systematic pipeline to stimulate histopathological image
   validation of advanced MRI techniques, such as sMRI.}},

Abstract = {{According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
   approximately 48 million people experience foodborne illnesses per year.
   The majority of the illnesses are attributed to the presence of bacteria
   in food products. However, there is some concern about the likelihood of
   food contamination resulting from intentional acts of sabotage. This
   research presents a stochastic model to quantify food supply chain
   vulnerability in terms of the number of people who become ill from
   consuming a contaminated food product. We specifically use a discrete
   time, discrete state Markov chain model with rewards and estimate
   consumer illness by product and distribution channel. The results of our
   computational study show the relationship between purchasing behavior,
   product shelf life, and consumer risk. We propose a classification
   scheme that can be used to categorize the level of vulnerability among
   different food distribution channels. We also show the impact of
   purchasing behavior on the speed with which the products are sold at
   each distribution channel. The proposed model has the potential to
   provide insight into timely interventions and influence how intervention
   policies would need to be tailored to each distribution channel in the
   event that a chemical contamination occurs.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of Ag-enriched Ag-Pd bimetallic nanoframes

   enriched in Ag. In comparison to both the Ag nanocubes and Ag@Ag-Pd

Abstract = {{We estimate D region changes due to 22 July 2009 total solar eclipse
   (SE), 13-14 November 2012 total SE, and 9-10 May 2013 annular SE, using
   VLF navigational transmitters signal observations at Suva, Fiji. The
   North West Cape (NWC) signal (19.8 kHz) showed an amplitude and phase
   decrease of 0.70 dB and 23 degrees during November SE and 2.0 dB and 90
   degrees during May SE. The modeling using Long Wave Propagation
   Capability code for NWC-Suva path during November and May SEs showed an
   increase in average D region reflection height (H') and sharpness factor
   (beta) by 0.6 and 0.5 km and 0.012 and 0.015 km(-1), respectively. The
   July total SE for JJI-Suva path showed an increase in H' of 1.5 km and a
   decrease in beta of 0.055 km(-1). The decrease in the electron density
   calculated using SE time H' and beta is maximum for July total SE and
   minimum for May annular SE. The effective recombination coefficient
   estimated from the decay and recovery of signal phase associated with
   May annular SE was higher (27\%) than normal daytime value 5.0 x 10(-7)
   cm(-3) s(-1) and varied between 1.47 x 10(-6) and 1.15 x 10(-7) cm(-3)
   s(-1) in the altitude 70 to 80 km. Morlet wavelet analysis of signals
   amplitude shows strong wave-like signatures (WLS) associated with three
   SEs with period ranging 24-66 min, but the intensity and duration of WLS
   show no clear dependence on SE magnitude and type. Apart from the
   cooling spot, the eclipse shadow can also generate WLS associated with
   atmospheric gravity waves.}},

Abstract = {{When the high voltage direct current (HVDC) system operates in monopole
   ground return mode, DC current flows through the neutral of AC power
   transformer with the neutral grounded which exacerbates the vibration of
   the transformer. During the field test of Yibin-Jinhua HVDC system in
   China, the vibration detection system is deployed to detect the
   vibration signal of the 500 kV transformer in Luzhou substation, which
   is close to the grounding substation. The spectrum of the transformer
   vibration signal is analyzed by means of the wavelet transform, through
   which the vibration acoustic fingerprint and three typical
   characteristic parameters, i.e., the distribution percentage of spectral
   energy, the energy ratio of odd and even harmonics, and the waveform
   distortion ratio, are extracted respectively. When the HVDC system
   current increases from 0 A to 5 kA, the impact of DC bias on the
   operation condition of the 500 kV transformer is investigated through
   the analysis of the variation of vibration acoustic fingerprint and
   three characteristic parameters. It is indicated that the energy radio
   of odd and even harmonics of the 500 kV transformer vibration signal
   decreases significantly with the increase of the current. In addition,
   the distribution percentage of spectral energy and the vibration
   acoustic fingerprint change significantly. This paper demonstrates that
   the effect of DC bias on the operating condition of the transformer can
   be accurately assessed by the proposed indices.}},

Title = {{Packet-Level Network Compression: Realization and Scaling of the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1588-1604}},

Abstract = {{The existence of considerable amount of redundancy in the Internet
   traffic at the packet level has stimulated the deployment of
   packet-level redundancy elimination techniques within the network by
   enabling network nodes to memorize data packets. Redundancy elimination
   results in traffic reduction which in turn improves the efficiency of
   network links. In this paper, the concept of network compression is
   introduced that aspires to exploit the statistical correlation beyond
   removing large duplicate strings from the flow to better suppress
   redundancy. In the first part of the paper, we introduce
   ``memory-assisted compression,{''} which utilizes the memorized content
   within the network to learn the statistics of the information source
   generating the packets which can then be used toward reducing the length
   of codewords describing the packets emitted by the source. Using
   simulations on data gathered from real network traces, we show that
   memory-assisted compression can result in significant traffic reduction.
   In the second part of the paper, we study the scaling of the average
   network-wide benefits of memory-assisted compression. We discuss routing
   and memory placement problems in network for the reduction of overall
   traffic. We derive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain
   in Erdos-Renyi random network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for
   the number of memories deployed in a random graph beyond which
   network-wide benefits start to shine. Finally, the network-wide benefits
   are studied on Internet-like scale-free networks. We show that
   non-vanishing network compression gain is obtained even when only a tiny
   fraction of the total number of nodes in the network are memory-enabled.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{We present a robust vector bioimpedance measurement system for
   longitudinal knee joint health assessment, capable of acquiring high
   resolution static (slowly varying over the course of hours to days) and
   dynamic (rapidly varying on the order of milli-seconds) bioresistance
   and bioreactance signals. Occupying an area of 78 x 90 mm(2) and
   consuming 0.25 W when supplied with +/- 5 V, the front-end achieves a
   dynamic range of 345 Omega and noise floor of 0.018 m Omega(rms)
   (resistive) and 0.055 m Omega(rms) (reactive) within a bandwidth of
   0.1-20 Hz. A microcontroller allows real-time calibration to minimize
   errors due to environmental variability (e. g., temperature) that can be
   experienced outside of lab environments, and enables data storage on a
   micro secure digital card. The acquired signals are then processed using
   customized physiology-driven algorithms to extract musculoskeletal
   (edema) and cardiovascular (local blood volume pulse) features from the
   knee joint. In a feasibility study, we found statistically significant
   differences (p < 0.01) between the injured and contralateral static knee
   impedance measures for two subjects with recent unilateral knee injury
   compared to seven controls. Specifically, the impedance was lower for
   the injured knees, supporting the physiological expectations for
   increased edema and damaged cell membranes. In a second feasibility
   study, we demonstrate the sensitivity of the dynamic impedance measures
   with a cold-pressor test, with a 20 m Omega decrease in the pulsatile
   resistance associated with increased downstream peripheral vascular
   resistance. The proposed system will serve as a foundation for future
   efforts aimed at quantifying joint health status continuously during
   normal daily life.}},

   During its operation the ASIC encodes head motion signals captured by
   the inertial sensors as electrical pulses ultimately targeted for
   in-vivo stimulation of vestibular nerve fibers. To achieve this, the
   ASIC implements a coordinate system transformation to correct for
   misalignment between natural sensors and implanted inertial sensors. It
   also mimics the frequency response characteristics and frequency
   encoding mappings of angular and linear head motions observed at the

Abstract = {{MUltiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) is a standard technique for
   direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with high resolution. However,
   MUSIC cannot estimate DOAs accurately in the case of underdetermined
   conditions, where the number of sources exceeds the number of
   microphones. To overcome this drawback, an extension of MUSIC using
   cumulants called 2q-MUSIC has been proposed, but this method greatly
   suffers from the variance of the statistics, given as the temporal mean
   of the observation process, and requires long observation. In this
   paper, we propose a new approach for extending MUSIC that exploits
   higher-order moments of the signal for the underdetermined DOA
   estimation with smaller variance. We propose an estimation algorithm
   that nonlinearly maps the observed signal onto a space with expanded
   dimensionality and conducts MUSIC-based correlation analysis in the
   expanded space. Since the dimensionality of the noise subspace is
   increased by the mapping, the proposed method enables the estimation of
   DOAs in the case of underdetermined conditions. Furthermore, we describe
   the class of mapping that allows us to analyze the higher-order moments
   of the observed signal in the original space. We compare 2q-MUSIC and
   the proposed method through an experiment assuming that the true number
   of sources is known as prior information to evaluate in terms of the
   bias-variance tradeoff of the statistics and computational complexity.
   The results clarify that the proposed method has advantages for both
   computational complexity and estimation accuracy in short-time analysis,
   i.e., the time duration of the analyzed data is short.}},

Abstract = {{Planners and economists generally accept that housing market values
   increase with proximity to transportation facilities through the
   provision of improved access to activity locations. While the market
   benefits of rail station access are well-documented, inconsistent and
   insufficient methods have led to limited agreement on the true value
   associated with this locational amenity. Far fewer hedonic price studies
   have assessed the influence of bike facility access on housing sales
   prices, and those that have generally analyze cross-sectional data. In
   this study, we estimated a spatial hedonic model using a bootstrapped
   pseudo panel to determine the joint impact of network proximity to bike
   lanes and off-street multi-use paths, as well as light rail and
   streetcar stations, on housing sales in Portland, Oregon, from 2002 to
   2013. Our findings revealed housing sales prices increased as network
   distance to the nearest light rail transit and streetcar station
   decreased. Likewise, owner-occupied single-family and multifamily
   housing sales rose in conjunction with reduced street network access to
   regional multi-use bike paths; however, improved proximity to on-street
   bike lanes negatively affected housing values. In sum, we believe these
   findings may help to inform non-automotive transportation infrastructure
   financing mechanisms that rely on rising property values. (C) 2016

Title = {{Realizing Ultra-Massive MIMO (1024 x 1024) communication in the
   (0.06-10) Terahertz band}},
Journal = {{NANO COMMUNICATION NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{46-54}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The increasing demand for higher bandwidth and higher speed wireless
   communication motivates the exploration of higher frequency bands. The
   Terahertz (THz) band (0.06-10 THz) is envisioned as one of the key
   players to meet the demand for such higher bandwidth and data rates.
   However, the available bandwidth at THz frequencies comes with the cost
   of a much higher propagation loss. Due to the power limitations of
   compact solid-state THz transceivers, this results in very short
   communication distances of approximately one meter. In this paper, the
   concept of Ultra-Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (UM MIMO)
   communication is introduced as a way to increase the communication
   distance and the achievable capacity of THz-band communication networks.
   The very small size of THz plasmonic nano-antennas, which leverage the
   properties of nanomaterials and metamaterials, enables the development
   of very large plasmonic arrays in very small footprints. For frequencies
   in the 0.06-1 THz range, metamaterials enable the design of plasmonic
   antenna arrays with hundreds of elements in a few square centimeters
   (e.g., 144 elements in 1 cm(2) at 60 GHz). In the 1-10 THz band,
   graphene-based plasmonic nano-antenna arrays with thousands of elements
   can be embedded in a few square millimeters (e.g., 1024 elements in 1
   mm(2) at 1 THz). The resulting arrays can be utilized both in
   transmission and in reception (e.g., 1024 x 1024 UM MIMO at 1 THz) to
   support different modes, from razor-sharp UM beamforming to UM spatial
   multiplexing, as well as multi-band communication schemes. After
   introducing the main properties of plasmonic nano-antenna arrays, the
   working modes of UM MIMO are presented, and preliminary results are
   provided to highlight the potential of this paradigm. Finally, open
   challenges and potential solutions to enable UM MIMO communication are
   described. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the first-of-its-kind additively manufactured
   microfluidics-based flexible RF sensor, combining microfluidics,
   inkjet-printing technology, and soft lithography, which could
   potentially enable the first ``real-world{''} wearable ``smart skin{''}
   applications. A low-cost, rapid, low-temperature, and zero-waste
   fabrication process is introduced, which can be used to realize complex
   microfluidic channel networks with virtually any type of sensing element
   embedded. For proof-of-concept purposes, a reusable and flexible
   microfluidics sensor was prototyped using this process, which only
   requires 0.6-mu L fluid volume to produce a 44\% frequency shift between
   an empty (epsilon(r) = 1) and a water-filled channel (epsilon(r) = 73),
   demonstrating a sensitivity that is higher than most previously reported
   microfluidics-based microwave sensors. Seven different fluids were used
   to measure the sensitivity of the prototype and an overall sensitivity
   of 24\%/log(epsilon(r)) was observed. The ``peel-and-replace{''}
   capability of the presented sensor not only facilitates the cleaning
   process for sensor reusability, but it also enables sensitivity
   tunability. For bent/conformed configurations, the sensor's
   functionality is good even for a bending radius down to 7 mm,
   demonstrating its great flexibility. After bending multiple times, the
   sensor still exhibits a very good performance repeatability, which
   verifies its reusability feature. The introduced additively manufactured
   RF microfluidics-based sensor would be well suited for numerous wearable
   and conformal fluid sensing applications (e.g., bodily fluids analyzing
   and food monitoring), while it could also be utilized in a variety of
   microfluidics-reconfigurable microwave components.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted a great attention as an
   excellent 2D material for future optoelectronic devices. Here, a novel
   MoS2 tribotronic phototransistor is developed by a conjunction of a MoS2
   phototransistor and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) in sliding
   mode. When an external friction layer produces a relative sliding on the
   device, the induced positive charges on the back gate of the MoS2
   phototransistor act as a ``gate{''} to increase the channel conductivity
   as the traditional back gate voltage does. With the sliding distance
   increases, the photoresponsivity of the device is drastically enhanced
   from 221.0 to 727.8 A W-1 at the 100 mW cm(-2) UV excitation intensity
   and 1 V bias voltage. This work has extended the emerging tribotronics
   to the field of photodetection based on 2D material, and demonstrated a
   new way to realize the adjustable photoelectric devices with high
   photoresponsivity via human interfacing.}},

   Metal/Semiconductor Composites}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED SCIENCE}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Plasmonics has remained a prominent and growing field over the past
   several decades. The coupling of various chemical and photo phenomenon
   has sparked considerable interest in plasmon-mediated photocatalysis.
   Given plasmonic photocatalysis has only been developed for a relatively
   short period, considerable progress has been made in improving the
   absorption across the full solar spectrum and the efficiency of
   photo-generated charge carrier separation. With recent advances in
   fundamental (i.e., mechanisms) and experimental studies (i.e., the
   influence of size, geometry, surrounding dielectric field, etc.) on
   plasmon-mediated photocatalysis, the rational design and synthesis of
   metal/semiconductor hybrid nanostructure photocatalysts has been
   realized. This review seeks to highlight the recent impressive
   developments in plasmon-mediated photocatalytic mechanisms (i.e.,
   Schottky junction, direct electron transfer, enhanced local electric
   field, plasmon resonant energy transfer, and scattering and heating
   effects), summarize a set of factors (i.e., size, geometry, dielectric
   environment, loading amount and composition of plasmonic metal, and
   nanostructure and properties of semi-conductors) that largely affect
   plasmonic photocatalysis, and finally conclude with a perspective on
   future directions within this rich field of research.}},

Title = {{A Six Degrees of Freedom Dynamic Wire-Driven Traverse}},

Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel support mechanism for a wind tunnel model is designed, built,
   and demonstrated on an aerodynamic platform undergoing dynamic
   maneuvers, tested with periodic motions up to 20 Hz. The platform is
   supported by a 6-DOF (six degrees of freedom) traverse that utilizes
   eight thin wires, each mounted to a servo motor with an in-line load
   cell to accurately monitor or control the platform motion and force
   responses. The system is designed such that simultaneous control of the
   servo motors effects motion within +/- 50 mm translations, +/- 15
   degrees pitch, +/- 9 degrees yaw, and +/- 8 degrees roll at lower
   frequencies. The traverse tracks a desired trajectory and resolves the
   induced forces on the platform at 1 kHz. The effected motion of the
   platform is measured at 0.6 kHz with a motion capture system, which
   utilizes six near-infrared (NIR) cameras for full spatial and temporal
   resolution of the platform motion, which is used for feedback control.
   The traverse allows different platform model geometries to be tested,
   and the present work demonstrates its capabilities on an axisymmetric
   bluff body. Programmable timed outputs are synchronized relative to the
   model motion and can be used for triggering external systems and
   processes. In the present study, particle image velocimetry (PIV) is
   used to characterize the realized wakes of the platform undergoing
   canonical motions that are effected by this new wind tunnel traverse.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the use of highly parallelized and high-speed data
   links has exacerbated the problem of crosstalk coupling. Signals with
   high frequency components couple to and degrade the quality of signals
   in adjacent lines aggressively with reduced device dimensions. In this
   paper, we propose a methodology for characterizing multiple crosstalk
   jitter effects in the time domain using a single data capture without
   the use of any channel models. The method uses repetitive data patterns
   across different signal lines with coprime periods. Each signal with
   crosstalk effects is digitized using sub-Nyquist sampling, and after
   back-end digital signal processing, the original transmitted signal on
   each line is isolated from its crosstalk components. Mathematical
   analysis shows that only by using patterns with coprime lengths,
   unbiased crosstalk characterization is possible. Hardware measurements
   support the proposed test methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of deformable and stretchable electronics calls for a
   deformable and stretchable power source. We report a scalable approach
   for energy harvesters and self-powered sensors that can be highly
   deformable and stretchable. With conductive liquid contained in a
   polymer cover, a shape-adaptive triboelectric nanogenerator (saTENG)
   unit can effectively harvest energy in various working modes. The saTENG
   can maintain its performance under a strain of as large as 300\%. The
   saTENG is so flexible that it can be conformed to any three-dimensional
   and curvilinear surface. We demonstrate applications of the saTENG as a
   wearable power source and self-powered sensor to monitor bio-mechanical
   motion. A bracelet-like saTENG worn on the wrist can light up more than
   80 light-emitting diodes. Owing to the highly scalable manufacturing
   process, the saTENG can be easily applied for large-area energy
   harvesting. In addition, the saTENG can be extended to extract energy
   from mechanical motion using flowing water as the electrode. This
   approach provides a new prospect for deformable and stretchable power

Abstract = {{The geological disposal of a high level radioactive waste relies in a
   system composed of engineered and geological barriers. The soils and
   rocks involved in the design of this type of solution are generally
   initially unsaturated and subject to complex thermal, hydraulic and
   mechanical (THM) coupled phenomena triggered by the simultaneous heating
   and hydration of the barrier materials under confined conditions.
   Mathematical THM formulations are typically used to analyze the behavior
   and long term performance of the barriers system. These types of
   formulations generally do not include some coupled processes, for
   example thermo-osmosis (i.e. the movement of liquid water induced by
   gradient of temperature), because they are considered not significant
   when compared against the main or direct processes (e.g., Darcy's,
   Fourier's and Fick's laws). In this work, the potential effects of
   thermo-osmotic phenomenon is studied in detail. Typical flow equations
   are modified to include thermo-osmotic flows and then they are
   implemented in numerical simulators. Two case studies are analyzed. The
   first one focuses on a simple and already proposed model to study the
   behavior of a geological barrier for nuclear waste when subjected to
   heating and hydration. The other case corresponds to the study of an
   engineered clay barrier material in the laboratory subjected to
   hydraulic and thermal gradients similar to the ones expected in real
   repository conditions. In both cases the analyses with and without
   thermo-osmotic flows are compared. From these comparisons it is observed
   that the effect of thermo-osmosis can be quite significant.
   Thermo-osmotic effects also assisted to explain the apparent low wetting
   observed in the hydration of a clayey barrier material. (C) 2016

Title = {{Stochastic frontier estimation of budgets for Kuhn-Tucker demand
   systems: Application to activity time-use analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{117-133}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose a stochastic frontier approach to estimate budgets for the
   multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. The approach
   is useful when the underlying time and/or money budgets driving a choice
   situation are unobserved, but the expenditures on the choice
   alternatives of interest are observed. Several MDCEV applications
   hitherto used the observed total expenditure on the choice alternatives
   as the budget to model expenditure allocation among choice alternatives.
   This does not allow for increases or decreases in the total expenditure
   due to changes in choice alternative specific attributes, but only
   allows a reallocation of the observed total expenditure among different
   alternatives. The stochastic frontier approach helps address this issue
   by invoking the notion that consumers operate under latent budgets that
   can be conceived (and modeled) as the maximum possible expenditure they
   are willing to incur. The proposed method is applied to analyze the
   daily out-of-home activity participation and time-use patterns in a
   survey sample of non-working adults in Florida. First, a stochastic
   frontier regression is performed on the observed out-of-home activity
   time expenditure (OH-ATE) to estimate the unobserved out-of-home
   activity time frontier (OH-ATF). The estimated frontier is interpreted
   as a subjective limit or maximum possible time individuals can allocate
   to out-of-home activities and used as the time budget governing
   out-of-home time-use choices in an MDCEV model. The efficacy of this
   approach is compared with other approaches for estimating time budgets
   for the MDCEV model, including: (a) a log-linear regression on the total
   observed expenditure for out-of-home activities and (b) arbitrarily
   assumed, constant time budgets for all individuals in the sample. A
   comparison of predictive accuracy in time-use patterns suggests that the
   stochastic frontier and log-linear regression approaches perform better
   than arbitrary assumptions on time budgets. Between the stochastic
   frontier and log-linear regression approaches, the former results in
   slightly better predictions of activity participation rates while the
   latter results in slightly better predictions of activity durations. A
   comparison of policy simulations demonstrates that the stochastic
   frontier approach allows for the total out-of-home activity time

Abstract = {{In the mixed capacitated general routing problem, one seeks to determine
   a minimum cost set of vehicle routes serving segments of a mixed network
   consisting of nodes, edges, and arcs. We study a bi-objective variant of
   the problem, in which, in addition to seeking a set of routes of low
   cost, one simultaneously seeks a set of routes in which the work load is
   balanced. Due to the conflict between the objectives, finding a solution
   that simultaneously optimizes both objectives is usually impossible.
   Thus, we seek to generate many or all efficient, or Pareto-optimal,
   solutions, i.e., solutions in which it is impossible to improve the
   value of one objective without deterioration in the value of the other
   objective. Route balance can be modeled in different ways, and a
   computational study using small benchmark instances of the mixed
   capacitated general routing problem demonstrates that the choice of
   route balance modeling has a significant impact on the number and
   diversity of Pareto-optimal solutions. The results of the computational
   study suggest that modeling route balance in terms of the difference
   between the longest and shortest route in a solution is a robust choice
   that performs well across a variety of instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{To date, the most commonly used outcome measure for assessing ideal
   binary mask estimation algorithms is based on the difference between the
   hit rate and the false alarm rate (H-FA). Recently, the error
   distribution has been shown to substantially affect intelligibility.
   However, H-FA treats each mask unit independently and does not take into
   account how errors are distributed. Alternatively, algorithms can be
   evaluated with the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric
   using the reconstructed speech. This study investigates the ability of
   H-FA and STOI to predict intelligibility for binary-masked speech using
   masks with different error distributions. The results demonstrate the
   inability of H-FA to predict the behavioral intelligibility and also
   illustrate the limitations of STOI. Since every estimation algorithm
   will make errors that are distributed in different ways, performance
   evaluations should not be made solely on the basis of these metrics. (C)

Title = {{Orbiting magnetic microbeads enable rapid microfluidic mixing}},
Journal = {{MICROFLUIDICS AND NANOFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We use three-dimensional numerical simulations and experiments to
   examine microfluidic mixing induced by orbiting magnetic microbeads in a
   microfluidic channel. We show that orbiting microbeads can lead to rapid
   fluid mixing in low Reynolds number flow, and identify two distinct
   mixing mechanisms. Bulk advection of fluid across the channel occurs due
   to the flow pattern that is developed when the ratio of flow velocity to
   bead velocity is low, and leads to rapid mixing. At higher velocity
   ratios, dispersion of small amounts of fluid across the channel occurs
   and results in increased mixing. We use simulations to investigate the
   effect of system parameters on the distance required to achieve a
   desired mixing level. We develop an experimental continuous-flow device
   and use it to validate our simulations and to demonstrate rapid
   microfluidic mixing. This device has the flexibility to also be applied
   to a mixing chamber or to stop-flow applications for rapid and
   controllable mixing. In addition to rapid mixing, the use of orbiting
   magnetic microbeads has the added benefit that functionalized microbeads
   can be used to capture particles from the fluid solution during mixing,
   and that they can be extracted from the device for analysis, thus
   serving multiple functionalities in a single device.}},

Abstract = {{To realize the sustainable energy supply in a smart city, it is
   essential to maximize energy scavenging from the city environments for
   achieving the self-powered functions of some intelligent devices and
   sensors. Although the solar energy can be well harvested by using
   existing technologies, the large amounts of wasted wind energy in the
   city cannot be effectively utilized since conventional wind turbine
   generators can only be installed in remote areas due to their large
   volumes and safety issues. Here, we rationally design a hybridized
   nanogenerator, including a solar cell (SC) and a triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG), that can individually/simultaneously scavenge
   solar and wind energies, which can be extensively installed on the roofs
   of the city buildings. Under the same device area of about 120 mm X 22
   mm, the SC can deliver a largest output power of about 8 mW, while the
   output power of the TENG can be up to 26 mW. Impedance matching between
   the SC and TENG has been achieved by using a transformer to decrease the
   impedance of the TENG. The hybridized nanogenerator has a larger output
   current and a better charging performance than that of the individual SC
   or TENG. This research presents a feasible approach to maximize solar
   and wind energies scavenging from the city environments with the aim to
   realize some self-powered functions in smart city.}},

Abstract = {{Based on white light emission at silicon (Si)/ZnO hetrerojunction, a
   pressure-sensitive Si/ZnO nanowires heterostructure matrix light
   emitting diode (LED) array is developed. The light emission intensity of
   a single heterostructure LED is tuned by external strain: when the
   applied stress keeps increasing, the emission intensity first increases
   and then decreases with a maximum value at a compressive strain of
   0.15-0.2\%. This result is attributed to the piezo-phototronic effect,
   which can efficiently modulate the LED emission intensity by utilizing
   the strain-induced piezo-polarization charges. It could tune the energy
   band diagrams at the junction area and regulate the optoelectronic
   processes such as charge carriers generation, separation, recombination,
   and transport. This study achieves tuning silicon based devices through

Abstract = {{Seeking to increase the triboelectric charge density on a friction layer
   is one of the most basic approaches to improve the output performance of
   triboelectric nano generators (TENGs). Here, we studied the storage
   mechanism of triboelectric charge in the friction layer and discussed
   the function of carrier mobility and concentration in the charge storing
   process. As guided by these results, a kind of composite structure is
   constructed in the friction layer to adjust the depth distribution of
   the triboelectric charges and improve the output performance of TENGs.
   To further elucidate this theory, a simple TENG, whose negative friction
   layer is a composite structure by integrating polystyrene (PS) and
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into polyvinylidene fabricated, and its
   performance test was also carried out. Comparing with a pure PVDF
   friction fluoride (PVDF), was layer, the composite friction layer can
   raise the triboelectric charge density by a factor of 11.2. The extended
   residence time of electrons in the friction layer is attributed to a
   large sum of electron trap levels from PS.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless traffic volume detectors play a critical role for measuring the
   traffic-flow in a real-time for current Intelligent Traffic System.
   However, as a battery-operated electronic device, regularly replacing
   battery remains a great challenge, especially in the remote area and
   wide distribution. Here, we report a self-powered active wireless
   traffic volume sensor by using a rotating-disk-based hybridized
   nanogenerator of triboelectric nanogenerator and electromagnetic
   generator as the sustainable power source. Operated at a rotating rate
   of 1000 rpm, the device delivered an output power of 17.5 mW,
   corresponding to a volume power density of 55.7 W/m(3) (P-d = P/V, see
   Supporting Information for detailed calculation) at a loading resistance
   of 700 Omega. The hybridized nanogenerator was demonstrated to
   effectively harvest energy from wind generated by a moving vehicle
   through the tunnel. And the delivered power is capable of triggering a
   counter via a wireless transmitter for real-time monitoring the traffic
   volume in the tunnel. This study further expands the applications of
   triboelectric nanogenerators for high-performance ambient mechanical
   energy harvesting and as sustainable power sources for driving wireless

Abstract = {{alpha `'-Fe16N2 has been suggested as a promising candidate for future
   rare-earth-free magnets. In this paper, a unique technical route
   including a ball milling approach and shock compaction is experimentally
   demonstrated as a promising way to produce an alpha `'-Fe16N2 magnet.
   Firstly, alpha `'-Fe16N2 powder is prepared by ball milling, in which
   ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is adopted as a solid nitrogen source. The
   volume ratio of the alpha `'-Fe16N2 phase reaches 70\% after 60 h of
   milling with a ball mill rotation speed of 600 rpm in planetary mode.
   Its saturation magnetization (M-s) is 210 emu g(-1) and the coercivity
   is 854 Oe at room temperature. After ball milling, shock compaction is
   used to compact the milled powder sample into a bulk magnet. Its
   magnetic properties and crystalline structure are characterized.
   Overall, the ball milling-based approach can be used to prepare alpha
   `'-Fe16N2 magnets at an industrial production level.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Impairment of coronary artery flow, in either acute or chronic
   conditions, is a severe complication of transcatheter aortic valve (TAV)
   implantation, which can arise due to improper TAV positioning. However,
   little work has been done to quantify the effects of the TAV positioning
   on the coronary flow. In this study, a realistic in vitro model of
   coronary artery flow was developed and used to investigate the impact of
   TAV deployed orientations on coronary flow. The coronary hemodynamics
   was first replicated mathematically using a lumped parameter model with
   time-varying myocardial resistance. Based on the analytical model, two
   stepper motor controlled stopcock valves were integrated in a left heart
   simulator to represent the variable myocardial resistance in the
   experimental setup. The coronary flow and pressure waveforms obtained
   from the in vitro system were consistent with published data. With a TAV
   deployed in different orientations, the measured results demonstrated
   that TAV orientation does not have a significant impact on the coronary
   flow. The developed in vitro model can be further utilized to simulate
   coronary flow under various pathological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the impact of prolapse meshes on vaginal smooth
   muscle structure (VaSM) and function, and to evaluate these outcomes in
   the context of the mechanical and textile properties of the mesh.
   Design Three months following the implantation of three polypropylene
   prolapse meshes with distinct textile and mechanical properties, mesh
   tissue explants were evaluated for smooth muscle contraction,
   innervation, receptor function, and innervation density.
   Setting Magee-Womens Research Institute at the University of Pittsburgh.
   Population Thirty-four parous rhesus macaques of similar age, parity,
   and pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) scores.
   Methods Macaques were implanted with mesh via sacrocolpopexy. The impact
   of Gynemesh (TM) PS (Ethicon; n = 7), Restorelle (R) (Coloplast; n = 7),
   UltraPro (TM) parallel and UltraPro (TM) perpendicular (Ethicon; n = 6
   and 7, respectively) were compared with sham-operated controls (n = 7).
   Outcomes were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U-tests and
   multiple regression analysis (P < 0.05).
   Mean outcome measures Vaginal tissue explants were evaluated for the
   maximum contractile force generated following muscle, nerve, and
   receptor stimulation, and for peripheral nerve density.
   Results Muscle myofibre, nerve, and receptor-mediated contractions were
   negatively affected by mesh only in the grafted region (P < 0.001, P =
   0.002, and P = 0.008, respectively), whereas cholinergic and adrenergic
   nerve densities were affected in the grafted (P = 0.090 and P = 0.008,
   respectively) and nongrafted (P = 0.009 and P = 0.005, respectively)
   regions. The impact varied by mesh property, as mesh stiffness was a
   significant predictor of the negative affect on muscle function and
   nerve density (P < 0.001 and P = 0.013, respectively), whereas mesh and
   weight was a predictor of receptor function (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Mesh has an overall negative impact on VaSM, and the effects
   are a function of mesh properties, most notably, mesh stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates are
   declining, racial-ethnic disparities in CRC mortality nationally are
   widening. Herein, the authors attempted to identify county-level
   variations in this pattern, and to characterize counties with improving
   disparity trends. METHODS: The authors examined 20-year trends in US
   county-level black-white disparities in CRC age-adjusted mortality rates
   during the study period between 1989 and 2010. Using a mixed linear
   model, counties were grouped into mutually exclusive patterns of
   black-white racial disparity trends in age-adjusted CRC mortality across
   20 three-year rolling average data points. County-level characteristics
   from census data and from the Area Health Resources File were normalized
   and entered into a principal component analysis. Multinomial logistic
   regression models were used to test the relation between these factors
   (clusters of related contextual variables) and the disparity trend
   pattern group for each county. RESULTS: Counties were grouped into 4
   disparity trend pattern groups: 1) persistent disparity (parallel black
   and white trend lines); 2) diverging (widening disparity); 3) sustained
   equality; and 4) converging (moving from disparate outcomes toward
   equality). The initial principal component analysis clustered the 82
   independent variables into a smaller number of components, 6 of which
   explained 47\% of the county-level variation in disparity trend
   patterns. CONCLUSIONS: County-level variation in social determinants,
   health care workforce, and health systems all were found to contribute
   to variations in cancer mortality disparity trend patterns from 1990
   through 2010. Counties sustaining equality over time or moving from
   disparities to equality in cancer mortality suggest that disparities are
   not inevitable, and provide hope that more communities can achieve
   optimal and equitable cancer outcomes for all. (C) 2016 American Cancer

Abstract = {{Systems biology often relies on large-scale measurements and
   model-building to understand how complex biological systems function.
   Microfluidic technology has been touted as a tool for high-throughput
   experiments and has been a valuable tool to some systems biology
   research. This review focuses on applications where microfluidics can
   enhance experimental sensitivity and throughput, particularly in recent
   development in single-cell analyses and analyses on multi-cellular or
   complex biological entities. We conclude that microfluidics is not
   necessarily always useful for systems biology, but when used
   appropriately can greatly enhance experimentalists' ability to measure
   and control, and thereby enhance the understanding of and expand the
   utility of biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Circuit-level models are developed to determine the upper bound on the
   performance of a 3-D IC link with through silicon vias (TSVs). It is
   shown that the performance of a 3-D link is limited not only by the
   on-chip interconnect RC, driver resistance, and TSV capacitance, but
   also by the current carrying capacity of the on-chip wires connecting
   the TSV to the input/output (I/O) driver. The models developed in this
   paper are used to optimize the I/O driver size, the number of on-chip
   wires connecting the TSV to the driver, and the data-rate to maximize
   the aggregate bandwidth per unit energy. Furthermore, in order to
   maximize the aggregate bandwidth of a 3-D link, it is shown that
   splitting the TSV array into smaller subarrays and placing the I/O
   drivers closer to the TSVs is better compared with having large TSV
   arrays.}},

   interconnect length and improve chip performance. In this paper,
   electrical links consisting of TSVs and horizontal wires are designed,

   Compact models for the capacitance of a TSV surrounded by variable
   number of ground TSVs are developed and compared with measurements. The
   impact of TSV placement and scaling on link performance is further
   analyzed. The results demonstrate that placing TSVs closer to their
   drivers can effectively improve the performance of 3-D integrated

   by scaling TSV geometry to the point that 3-D IC links become on-chip

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive the critical transmission range, i.e., the
   smallest transmission distance of nodes such that wireless network can
   be connected, in large-scale clustered wireless networks. Contrary to
   most previous literature on independent and homogeneous mobility of
   nodes, we consider general settings with inhomogeneous node distribution
   and correlated mobility. In particular, we consider three network states
   based on the degree of correlation among nodes, i.e., cluster-sparse
   state (strong correlations), cluster-dense state (weak correlations),
   and cluster-transitional state (medium correlations). Under each state,
   we focus on the following problems: 1) how to place cluster-head nodes
   to minimize the critical transmission range and 2) what is the
   corresponding minimum critical transmission range. We derive the optimal
   distribution of cluster-head nodes that minimizes the critical
   transmission range, and show that the inhomogeneous distribution of
   mobile nodes leads to a smaller critical transmission range.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the introduction of 21st-century surgical and
   neoadjuvant treatment modalities, survival of patients with osteosarcoma
   (OS) has not improved in two decades. Advances will depend in part on
   the development of clinically relevant and reliable animal models. This
   report describes the engineering and validation of a humanized
   tissue-engineered bone organ (hTEBO) for preclinical research on primary
   bone tumors in order to minimize false-positive and false-negative
   results due to interspecies differences in current xenograft models.
   Methods: Pelvic bone and marrow fragments were harvested from patients
   during reaming of the acetabulum during hip arthroplasty. HTEBOs were
   engineered by embedding fragments in a fibrin matrix containing bone
   morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) and implanted into NOD-scid mice. After
   10 weeks of subcutaneous growth, one group of hTEBOs was harvested to
   analyze the degree of humanization. A second group was injected with
   human luciferase-labeled OS (Luc-SAOS-2) cells. Tumor growth was
   followed in vivo with bioluminescence imaging. After 5 weeks, the OS
   tumors were harvested and analyzed. They were also compared with tumors
   created via intratibial injection.
   Results: After 10 weeks of in vivo growth, a new bone organ containing
   human bone matrix as well as viable and functional human hematopoietic
   cells developed. Five weeks after injection of Luc-SAOS-2 cells into
   this humanized bone microenvironment, spontaneous metastatic spread to
   the lung was evident. Relevant prognostic markers such as vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and periostin were found to be positive
   in OS tumors grown within the humanized microenvironment but not in
   tumors created in murine tibial bones. Hypoxia-inducible transcription
   factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) was detected only in the humanized OS.
   Conclusions: We report an in vivo model that contains human bone matrix
   and marrow components in one organ. BMP-7 made it possible to maintain
   viable mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells and created a bone
   microenvironment mimicking human physiology.}},

Abstract = {{AimsHigh-quality urodynamic studies in patients with neurogenic lower
   urinary tract dysfunction are important, as UDS may be the only reliable
   gauge of potential risk for upper tract deterioration and the optimal
   tool to guide lower urinary tract management. Reliance on direct
   visualization of leakage during typical UDS remains a potential source
   of error.
   MethodsGiven the necessity of accurate leak point pressures, we
   developed a wireless leak detection sensor to eliminate the need for
   visual inspection during UDS.
   ResultsA mean decrease in detrusor leak point pressure of 3cm/H(2)0 and
   a mean 11\% decrease in capacity at leakage was observed when employing
   the sensor compared to visual inspection in children undergoing two
   fillings during a single UDS session.

   large-scale phase separation upon cooling the solution to room
   temperature. The resulting precursor fiber from this gel was hot-drawn
   to a ratio of 120, yielding a fiber with tensile strength of 4 GPa and
   Young's modulus of over 150 GPa. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction indicates
   good molecular orientation along the fiber axis. The results also
   demonstrate the potential to further improve the mechanical properties.
   With respect to the gel spinning industry, this new solvent has a number
   of advantages over paraffin oil and decahydronaphthalene, and holds a
   promise of greatly improving the process efficiency. (C) 2016 Society of

Title = {{Unobtrusive Estimation of Cardiac Contractility and Stroke Volume
   Changes Using Ballistocardiogram Measurements on a High Bandwidth Force
   Plate}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Unobtrusive and inexpensive technologies for monitoring the
   cardiovascular health of heart failure (HF) patients outside the clinic
   can potentially improve their continuity of care by enabling therapies
   to be adjusted dynamically based on the changing needs of the patients.
   Specifically, cardiac contractility and stroke volume (SV) are two key
   aspects of cardiovascular health that change significantly for HF
   patients as their condition worsens, yet these parameters are typically
   measured only in hospital/clinical settings, or with implantable
   sensors. In this work, we demonstrate accurate measurement of cardiac
   contractility (based on pre-ejection period, PEP, timings) and SV
   changes in subjects using ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals detected via
   a high bandwidth force plate. The measurement is unobtrusive, as it
   simply requires the subject to stand still on the force plate while
   holding electrodes in the hands for simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG)
   detection. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether the high bandwidth
   force plate can provide accuracy beyond what is achieved using modified
   weighing scales we have developed in prior studies, based on timing
   intervals, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimates. Our results
   indicate that the force plate BCG measurement provides more accurate
   timing information and allows for better estimation of PEP than the
   scale BCG (r(2) = 0.85 vs. r(2) = 0.81) during resting conditions. This
   correlation is stronger during recovery after exercise due to more
   significant changes in PEP (r(2) = 0.92). The improvement in accuracy
   can be attributed to the wider bandwidth of the force plate. Delta SV
   (i.e., changes in stroke volume) estimations from the force plate BCG
   resulted in an average error percentage of 5.3\% with a standard
   deviation of +/- 4.2\% across all subjects. Finally, SNR calculations
   showed slightly better SNR in the force plate measurements among all
   subjects but the small difference confirmed that SNR is limited by
   motion artifacts rather than instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Microstickies deposits on both paper machine and paper products when it
   agglomerates under step change in ionic strength, pH, temperature and
   chemical additives. These stickies increase the down time of the paper
   mill and decrease the quality of paper. The key property of
   microstickies is its smaller size, which leads to low removal efficiency
   and difficulties in measurement. Thus the increase of microstickies size
   help improve both removal efficiency and reduce measurement difficulty.
   In this paper, a new agglomeration technology based on electric field
   was investigated. The electric treatment could also increase the size of
   stickies particles by around 100 times. The synergetic effect between
   electric field treatment and detacky chemicals/dispersants, including
   polyvinyl alcohol, poly(diallylmethylammonium chloride) and
   lignosulfonate, was also studied.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The coal-fired power industry in the United States faces growing needs
   to improve wastewater treatment and disposal practices, especially for
   wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems.. Zero liquid discharge (ZLD)
   treatment systems may be implemented, and one ZLD option is the coupling
   of brine concentration with solidification/stabilization (S/S). This S/S
   process could be achieved by co-disposing the concentrated FGD brines
   with coal fly ash (CFA) and Portland cement. S/S using bituminous CFA
   (BCFA) achieved good retainment (average 68-90\%) of As-V, Cd-II, Hg-II,
   and Se-IV in the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP);
   however, poor retainment was observed for Cr-VI and Se-VI. Separate
   experiments showed good sorption of As-V, Cd-II, Hg-II, and Se-IV
   (average 56-100\%) but poor sorption of Cr-VI and Se-VI to S/S solids.
   Meanwhile, Cr-VI and Se-VI retainment could be enhanced by addition of
   FeSO4 to the S/S mixture, likely due to reduction of these metals to
   lower oxidation states. Compared to BCFA, S/S using sub-bituminous CFA
   (SCFA) resulted in higher pH S/S solids and final TCLP leachate, which
   increased retainment of As-V, Cd-II, and Se-VI. Apart from the pH impact
   on the process, As-V retainment was likely improved by the high Ca
   content of SCFA and Se-VI retainment was improved by the incorporation
   of SeO42- in Friedel's salt (AFm-Cl) by exchange with Cl-. Friedel's
   salt was positively identified by X-ray diffraction in the SCFA S/S
   solids but not for the BCFA S/S solids. Even so, reduction of Se-VI plus
   S/S is likely a better immobilization strategy than SeO42- substitution
   in the AFm phase because of higher stability under long-term landfill
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-low-power embedded memory is emerging as a key challenge to design
   systems with stringent energy but relaxed performance constraints like
   various wireless sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This
   paper explores the potential of Si/Ge tunnel FETs (TFET) in designing
   ultra-low power embedded memory bit cells, namely, Static Random Access
   Memory (SRAM) and embedded Dynamic RAM (eDRAM). A Technology CAD
   (TCAD)-based model of 22-nm Si/Ge TFET is designed and coupled with
   mixed-mode circuit simulation. The circuit-level analysis is performed
   to study the standby power, performance, and robustness characteristics
   of TFET SRAM and eDRAM. The results are compared with 22 nm FinFET-based
   design. The analysis shows that at higher performance targets,
   TFET-based embedded memory consumes higher standby energy; however, the
   energy-efficiency of TFET is much better when compared at reduced
   performance targets. Moreover, it is observed that the cell and array
   level circuit design strategies that exploit unique TFET properties can
   help improve robustness at low power regimes.}},

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The current study presents a nanoscale in silico investigation of strain
   rate dependency of membrane (phospholipid bilayer) failure when placed
   under strip biaxial tension with two planar areas. The nanoscale
   simulations were conducted in the context of a multiscale modelling
   framework in which the macroscale damage (pore volume fraction)
   progression is delineated into pore nucleation (number density of
   pores), pore growth (size of pores), and pore coalescence (inverse of
   nearest neighbor distance) mechanisms. As such, the number density, area
   fraction, and nearest neighbor distances were quantified in association
   with the stress-strain behavior. Deformations of a
   1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer were performed
   using molecular dynamics to simulate mechanoporation of a neuronal cell
   membrane due to injury, which in turn can result in long-term
   detrimental effects that could ultimately lead to cell death. Structures
   with 72 and 144 phospholipids were subjected to strip biaxial tensile
   deformations at multiple strain rates. Formation of a water bridge
   through the phospholipid bilayer was the metric to indicate structural
   failure. Both the larger and smaller bilayers had similar behavior
   regarding pore nucleation and the strain rate effect on pore growth post
   water penetration. The applied strain rates, planar area, and
   cross-sectional area had no effect on the von Mises strains at which
   pores greater than 0.1 nm(2) were detected (0.509 +/- 7.8\%) or the von
   Mises strain at failure (epsilon(failure) = 0.68 +/- 4.8\%).
   Additionally, changes in bilayer planar and cross-sectional areas did
   not affect the stress response. However, as the strain rate increased
   from 2.0 x 10(8) s(-1) to 1.0 x 10(9) s(-1), the yield stress increased
   from 26.5 MPa to 66.7 MPa and the yield strain increased from 0.056 to
   0.226.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the morphology of polymer semiconductors remains a
   fundamental challenge that hinders their widespread applications in
   electronic and optoelectronic devices and commercial feasibility.
   Although conjugated polymer nanowires (NWs) are envisioned to afford
   high charge-carrier mobility, the alignment of preformed conjugated
   polymer NWs has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate an extremely
   simple and effective strategy to generate well-aligned arrays of
   one-dimensional (1D) polymer semiconductors that exhibit remarkable
   enhancement in charge transport using a solution shear-coating
   technique. We show that solution shear coating of poly(alkylthiophene)
   NWs induces extension or coplanarization of the polymer backbone and
   highly aligned network films, which results in enhanced intra- and
   intermolecular ordering and reduced grain boundaries. Consequently,
   highly aligned poly(3-hexylthiophene) NWs exhibited over 33-fold
   enhancement in the average carrier mobility, with the highest mobility
   of 0.32 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) compared to pristine films. The presented
   platform is a promising strategy and general approach for achieving
   well-aligned 1D nanostructures of polymer semiconductors and could
   enable the next generation of high-performance flexible electronic
   devices for a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Axial excitation confinement beyond the diffraction limit is crucial to
   the development of next-generation, super-resolution microscopy.
   STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy offers lateral
   super-resolution using a donut-beam depletion, but its axial resolution
   is still over 500 nm. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy
   is widely used for single-molecule localization, but its ability to
   detect molecules is limited to within the evanescent field of similar to
   100 nm from the cell attachment surface. We find here that the axial
   thickness of the point spread function (PSF) during confocal excitation
   can be easily improved to 110 nm by replacing the microscopy slide with
   a mirror. The interference of the local electromagnetic field confined
   the confocal PSF to a 110-nm spot axially, which enables axial
   super-resolution with all laser-scanning microscopes. Axial sectioning
   can be obtained with wavelength modulation or by controlling the spacer
   between the mirror and the specimen. With no additional complexity, the
   mirror-assisted excitation confinement enhanced the axial resolution
   six-fold and the lateral resolution two-fold for STED, which together
   achieved 19-nm resolution to resolve the inner rim of a nuclear pore
   complex and to discriminate the contents of 120 nm viral filaments. The
   ability to increase the lateral resolution and decrease the thickness of
   an axial section using mirror-enhanced STED without increasing the laser
   power is of great importance for imaging biological specimens, which
   cannot tolerate high laser power.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design of foldable propellers for a hybrid-driven
   underwater glider. The design ensures that the propellers are fully
   closed when the glider is working in buoyancy-driven gliding mode, and
   become fully open to provide propulsion when necessary. The
   hydrodynamical moments during the folding and unfolding processes is
   analyzed and computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods.
   Torsion springs are used as key components in the folding and unfolding
   mechanism. The stiffness of the torsion springs are designed to achieve
   balance between the mechanical and hydrodynamical moments acting on the
   propellers. It is shown that comparing to a conventional unfoldable
   design, the foldable propellers may achieve a significant reduction in
   drag force when the glider is operating in the gliding mode. Pool
   experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the folding
   mechanism when installed on an underwater glider. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Acute aortic regurgitation (AR) post-chronic aortic stenosis is a
   prevalent phenomenon occurring in patients who undergo transcatheter
   aortic valve replacement (TAVR) surgery. The objective of this work was
   to characterize the effects of left ventricular diastolic stiffness
   (LVDS) and AR severity on LV performance. Three LVDS models were
   inserted into a physiological left heart simulator. AR severity was
   parametrically varied through four levels (ranging from trace to
   moderate) and compared with a competent aortic valve. Hemodynamic
   metrics such as average diastolic pressures (DP) and reduction in
   transmitral flow were measured. AR index was calculated as a function of
   AR severity and LVDS, and the work required to make up for lost volume
   due to AR was estimated. In the presence of trace AR, higher LVDS had up
   to a threefold reduction in transmitral flow (13\% compared with 3.5\%)
   and a significant increase in DP (2-fold). The AR index ranged from
   similar to 42 to 16 (no AR to moderate AR), with stiffer LVs having
   lower values. To compensate for lost volume due to AR, the low, medium,
   and high LVDS models were found to require 5.1, 5.5, and 6.6 times more
   work, respectively. This work shows that the LVDS has a significant
   effect on the LV performance in the presence of AR. Therefore, the LVDS
   of potential TAVR patients should be assessed to gain an initial
   indication of their ability to tolerate post-procedural AR.}},

Abstract = {{We present results on the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars at
   redshift 7.6 from the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of extremely
   high-resolution and physics-rich radiation transport hydrodynamics
   cosmological adaptive-mesh refinement simulations of high-redshift
   galaxy formation performed on the Blue Waters supercomputer. In a survey
   volume of about 220 comoving Mpc(3), we found 14 Pop III galaxies with
   recent star formation. The surprisingly late formation of Pop III stars
   is possible due to two factors: (i) the metal enrichment process is
   local and slow, leaving plenty of pristine gas to exist in the vast
   volume; and (ii) strong Lyman-Werner radiation from vigorous
   metal-enriched star formation in early galaxies suppresses Pop III
   formation in ({''}not so{''}) small primordial halos with mass less than
   similar to 3 x 10(7) M-circle dot. We quantify the properties of these
   Pop III galaxies and their Pop III star formation environments. We look
   for analogs to the recently discovered luminous Ly alpha emitter CR7,
   which has been interpreted as a Pop III star cluster within or near a
   metal-enriched star-forming galaxy. We find and discuss a system similar

Abstract = {{We set out to compare the osteogenicity of human mesenchymal stem
   (hMSCs) and osteoblasts (hOBs). Upon osteogenic induction in monolayer,
   hMSCs showed superior matrix mineralization expressing characteristic
   bone-related genes. For scaffold cultures, both cell types presented
   spindle-shaped, osteoblast-like morphologies forming a dense,
   interconnected network of high viability. On the scaffolds, hOBs
   proliferated faster. A general upregulation of parathyroid
   hormone-related protein (PTHrP), osteoprotegrin (OPG), receptor
   activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL), sclerostin (SOST), and dentin
   matrix protein 1 (DMP1) was observed for both cell types.
   Simultaneously, PTHrP, RANKL and DMP-1 expression decreased under
   osteogenic stimulation, while OPG and SOST increased significantly.
   Following transplantation into NOD/SCID mice, mu CT and histology showed
   increased bone deposition with hOBs. The bone was vascularized, and
   amounts further increased for both cell types after recombinant human
   bone morphogenic protein 7 - (rhBMP-7) addition also stimulating
   osteoclastogenesis. Complete bone organogenesis was evidenced by the

Abstract = {{Alignment-free approaches are gaining persistent interest in many
   sequence analysis applications such as phylogenetic inference and
   metagenomic classification/clustering, especially for large-scale
   sequence datasets. Besides the widely used k-mer methods, the average
   common substring (ACS) approach has emerged to be one of the well-known
   alignment-free approaches. Two recent works further generalize this ACS
   approach by allowing a bounded number k of mismatches in the common
   substrings, relying on approximation (linear time) and exact
   computation, respectively. Albeit having a good worst-case time
   complexity O(n log(k) n), the exact approach is complex and unlikely to
   be efficient in practice. Herein, we present ALFRED, an alignment-free
   distance computation method, which solves the generalized common
   substring search problem via exact computation. Compared to the
   theoretical approach, our algorithm is easier to implement and more
   practical to use, while still providing highly competitive theoretical
   performances with an expected run-time of O(n logk n). By applying our
   program to phylogenetic inference as a case study, we find that our
   program facilitates to exactly reconstruct the topology of the reference
   phylogenetic tree for a set of 27 primate mitochondrial genomes, at
   reasonably acceptable speed. ALFRED is implemented in C++ programming
   language and the source code is freely available online.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents microfabricated permanent magnets possessing a
   multilayer structure that preserves the high magnetic energy density of
   thinner magnetic films, while simultaneously reducing average residual
   stress of the films and achieving a significant magnetic thickness. Many
   magnetic microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices heavily rely on
   the availability of thick (a few tens to hundreds of micrometers,
   high-energy-density permanent magnet components able to be deposited in
   a fully integrated and CMOS-compatible manner (process temperature less
   than 450 degrees C). However, it is observed that increasing magnetic
   film thickness typically causes a concomitant decrease in magnetic
   properties such as maximum energy density and increased mechanical
   instability (cracking and delaminating, due to the increased elastic
   strain energy stored in the films as magnetic volume increases), both of
   which limit the maximum total magnetic energy of these small-scale
   integrated magnets. The microlaminated permanent magnet presented here
   utilizes sequential multilayer electroplating in which the alternating
   layers of relatively thin magnetic films (CoNiP, micrometer range) and
   non-magnetic materials (Cu, a few tens of nanometer to micrometer range)
   are electrodeposited in a multilayer fashion realizing thick laminated
   permanent micromagnets with improved total magnetic energy as compared
   with their non-laminated counterparts. Low interface roughness has been
   demonstrated to play an important role in preserving the component
   magnetic thin layer properties in the multilayer configuration.}},

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{A number of groups have reported the syntheses of nanosized Pt-Ni
   octahedra with remarkable activities toward the oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR), a process key to the operation of proton-exchange
   membrane fuel cells. However, the throughputs of those batch-based
   syntheses are typically limited to a scale of 5-25 mg Pt per batch,
   which is far below the amount needed for commercial evaluation. Here we
   report the use of droplet reactors for the continuous and scalable
   production of Pt-Ni octahedra with high activities toward ORE. In a
   typical synthesis, Pt(acac)(2), Ni(acac)(2), and W(CO)(6) were dissolved
   in a mixture of oleylamine, oleic acid, and benzyl ether, and then
   pumped into a polytetrafluoroethylene tube. When the solution entered
   the reaction zone at a temperature held in the range of 170-230 degrees
   C, W(CO)(6) quickly decomposed to generate CO gas, naturally separating
   the reaction solution into discrete, uniform droplets. Each droplet then
   served as a reactor for the nucleation and growth of Pt Ni octahedra
   whose size and composition could be controlled by changing the
   composition of the solvent and/or adjusting the amount of Ni(acac)2
   added into the reaction solution. For a catalyst based on Pt24Ni
   octahedra of 9 nm in edge length, it showed an ORR mass activity of 2.67
   A mg(pt)(-1) at 0.9 V, representing an 11-fold improvement over a
   state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.24 A mg(pt)(-1)).}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved oxygen in the mid-depth tropical Pacific Ocean has declined in
   the past several decades(1). The resulting expansion of the oxygen
   minimum zone has consequences for the region's ecosystem(2) and
   biogeochemical cycles(3), but the causes of the oxygen decline are not
   yet fully understood. Here we combine models of atmospheric chemistry,
   ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling to test the hypothesis that
   atmospheric pollution over the Pacific Ocean contributed to the
   redistribution of oxygen in deeper waters. We simulate the
   pollution-induced enhancement of atmospheric soluble iron and fixed
   nitrogen deposition, as well as its impacts on ocean productivity and
   biogeochemical cycling for the late twentieth century. The model
   reproduces the magnitude and large-scale pattern of the observed oxygen
   changes from the 1970s to the 1990s, and the sensitivity experiments
   reveal the reinforcing effects of pollution-enhanced iron deposition and
   natural climate variability. Despite the aerosol deposition being the
   largest in mid-latitudes, its effect on oceanic oxygen is most
   pronounced in the tropics, where ocean circulation transports added iron
   to the tropics, leading to an increased regional productivity,
   respiration and subsurface oxygen depletion. These results suggest that
   anthropogenic pollution can interact and amplify climate-driven impacts
   on ocean biogeochemistry, even in remote ocean biomes.}},

Abstract = {{Given that it is not always feasible to reach an affected area via land
   or sea within the first week following a natural disaster, aerial
   delivery provides the primary means to rapidly supply the affected
   population. Further, it is often the case that high density delivery of
   humanitarian aid supplies are taken over by non-friendly groups within
   the affected population. By using direct airdrop systems to deliver
   large quantities of individually wrapped food and water items,
   dispersion among the affected disaster relief population will occur more
   quickly. In this paper, we proffer a multiple criteria decision analysis
   (MCDA) framework to optimize the military humanitarian
   assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) aerial delivery supply chain network.
   The model uses stochastic, mixed-integer, weighted goal programming to
   optimize network design, logistics costs, staging locations, procurement
   amounts, and inventory levels. The MCDA framework enables
   decision-makers to explore the trade-offs between military HA/DR aerial
   delivery supply chain efficiency and responsiveness, while optimizing
   across a wide range of real-world, probabilistic scenarios to account
   for the inherent uncertainty in the location of global humanitarian
   disasters as well as the amount of demand to be met.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins represent a major class of therapeutic molecules with vast
   potential for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases and
   regenerative medicine applications. Hydrogels have long been
   investigated for their potential in carrying and delivering proteins. As
   compared to bulk hydrogels, hydrogel microparticles (microgels) hold
   promise in improving aspects of delivery owing to their less traumatic
   route of entry into the body and improved versatility. This review
   discusses common methods of fabricating microgels, including emulsion
   polymerization, microfluidic techniques, and lithographic techniques.
   Microgels synthesized from both natural and synthetic polymers are
   discussed, as are a series of microgels fashioned from

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiologic studies suggest associations between
   preterm birth and ambient air pollution.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations between 11 ambient air
   pollutants, estimated by combining Community Multiscale Air Quality
   model (CMAQ) simulations with measurements from stationary monitors, and
   risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) in the U.S. state of
   Georgia.
   METHODS:Birth records for singleton births = 27 weeks of gestation with
   complete covariate information and estimated dates of conception between
   1 January 2002 and 28 February 2006 were obtained from the Office of
   Health Indicators for Planning, Georgia Department of Public Health (n =
   511,658 births). Daily pollutant concentrations at 12-km resolution were
   estimated for 11 ambient air pollutants. We used logistic regression
   with county-level fixed effects to estimate associations between preterm
   birth and average pollutant concentrations during the first and second
   trimester. Discrete-time survival models were used to estimate
   third-trimester and total pregnancy associations. Effect modification
   was investigated by maternal education, race, census tract poverty
   level, and county-level urbanicity.
   RESULTS:Trimester-specific and total pregnancy associations (p < 0.05)
   were observed for several pollutants. All the traffic-related pollutants
   (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 elemental carbon) were
   associated with preterm birth {[}e.g., odds ratios for interquartile
   range increases in carbon monoxide during the first, second, and third
   trimesters and total pregnancy were 1.005 (95\% CI: 1.001, 1.009), 1.007
   (95\% CI: 1.002, 1.011), 1.010 (95\% CI: 1.006, 1.014), and 1.011 (95\%
   CI: 1.006, 1.017)]. Associations tended to be higher for mothers with
   low educational attainment and African American mothers.
   CONCLUSION:Several ambient air pollutants were associated with preterm
   birth; associations were observed in all exposure windows.}},

Abstract = {{The theory on the glymphatic convection mechanism of cerebrospinal fluid
   holds that cardiac pulsations in part pump cerebrospinal fluid from the
   peri-arterial spaces through the extracellular tissue into the
   peri-venous spaces facilitated by aquaporin water channels. Since
   cardiac pulses cannot be the sole mechanism of glymphatic propulsion, we
   searched for additional cerebrospinal fluid pulsations in the human
   brain with ultra-fast magnetic resonance encephalography. We detected
   three types of physiological mechanisms affecting cerebral cerebrospinal
   fluid pulsations: cardiac, respiratory, and very low frequency
   pulsations. The cardiac pulsations induce a negative magnetic resonance
   encephalography signal change in peri-arterial regions that extends
   centrifugally and covers the brain in approximate to 1 Hz cycles. The
   respiratory approximate to 0.3 Hz pulsations are centripetal periodical
   pulses that occur dominantly in peri-venous areas. The third type of
   pulsation was very low frequency (VLF 0.001-0.023 Hz) and low frequency
   (LF 0.023-0.73 Hz) waves that both propagate with unique spatiotemporal
   patterns. Our findings using critically sampled magnetic resonance
   encephalography open a new view into cerebral fluid dynamics. Since
   glymphatic system failure may precede protein accumulations in diseases
   such as Alzheimer's dementia, this methodological advance offers a novel
   approach to image brain fluid dynamics that potentially can enable early
   detection and intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The search for novel tools to control magnetism at the nanoscale is
   crucial for the development of new paradigms in optics, electronics and
   spintronics. So far, the fabrication of magnetic nanostructures has been
   achieved mainly through irreversible structural or chemical
   modifications. Here, we propose a new concept for creating
   reconfigurable magnetic nanopatterns by crafting, at the nanoscale, the
   magnetic anisotropy landscape of a ferromagnetic layer exchange-coupled
   to an antiferromagnetic layer. By performing localized field cooling
   with the hot tip of a scanning probe microscope, magnetic structures,
   with arbitrarily oriented magnetization and tunable unidirectional
   anisotropy, are reversibly patterned without modifying the film
   chemistry and topography. This opens unforeseen possibilities for the
   development of novel metamaterials with finely tuned magnetic
   properties, such as reconfigurable magneto-plasmonic and magnonic
   crystals. In this context, we experimentally demonstrate spatially
   controlled spin wave excitation and propagation in magnetic structures
   patterned with the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonics has generated tremendous excitement because of its unique
   capability to focus light into subwavelength volumes(1), beneficial for
   various applications such as light harvesting(2,3), photodetection(4),
   sensing(5), catalysis(6) and so on. Here we demonstrate a
   plasmon-enhanced solar desalination device, fabricated by the
   self-assembly of aluminium nanoparticles into a three-dimensional porous
   membrane. The formed porous plasmonic absorber can float naturally on
   water surface, efficiently absorb a broad solar spectrum (>96\%) and
   focus the absorbed energy at the surface of the water to enable
   efficient (similar to 90\%) and effective desalination (a decrease of
   four orders of magnitude). The durability of the devices has also been
   examined, indicating a stable performance over 25 cycles under various
   illumination conditions. The combination of the significant desalination
   effect, the abundance and low cost of the materials, and the scalable
   production processes suggest that this type of plasmon-enhanced solar
   desalination device could provide a portable desalination solution.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of sliding window correlation performance for characterizing

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A promising recent development in the study of brain function is the
   dynamic analysis of resting-state functional MRI scans, which can
   enhance understanding of normal cognition and alterations that result
   from brain disorders. One widely used method of capturing the dynamics
   of functional connectivity is sliding window correlation (SWC). However,
   in the absence of a ``gold standard{''} for comparison, evaluating the
   performance of the SWC in typical resting-state data is challenging.
   This study uses simulated networks (SNs) with known transitions to
   examine the effects of parameters such as window length, window offset,
   window type, noise, filtering, and sampling rate on the SWC performance.
   The SWC time course was calculated for all node pairs of each SN and
   then clustered using the k-means algorithm to determine how resulting
   brain states match known configurations and transitions in the SNs. The
   outcomes show that the detection of state transitions and durations in
   the SWC is most strongly influenced by the window length and offset,
   followed by noise and filtering parameters. The effect of the image
   sampling rate was relatively insignificant. Tapered windows provide less
   sensitivity to state transitions than rectangular windows, which could
   be the result of the sharp transitions in the SNs. Overall, the SWC gave
   poor estimates of correlation for each brain state. Clustering based on
   the SWC time course did not reliably reflect the underlying state
   transitions unless the window length was comparable to the state
   duration, highlighting the need for new adaptive window analysis
   techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of doping amount and particle size of alumina on the

   and the electrical performance of YSZ, and the optimum doping amount
   varies with the particle size of Al2O3. When a raw Al2O3 powder (modal
   particle size: 028 mu m) is used as dopant, the optimal doping amount
   for electrical and sintering improvement is 0.7 wt.\% and 3 wt\%,
   respectively, while that with 1400 degrees C-calcined-Al2O3 (0.45 mu m),
   1 wt.\% and 4 wt.\%. A concept of space distribution distance of the
   doping particles is introduced to interpret the improvement effect. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigated patterns in denitrifier and NH3-oxidizer community
   structure and function along environmental gradients in midwestern USA
   wetlands. Denitrifier and NH3-oxidizer functional groups have
   contrasting sensitivities to O-2 levels and other soil factors. Thus,
   variable environmental tolerance among and within functional groups can
   result in a range of microbial responses to the same environmental
   gradient. We compared microbial structure function relationships in 2
   restored wetlands in Illinois and 2 natural wetlands in Michigan. At
   each site, we established 4 transects perpendicular to the shore and
   placed 4 plots along each transect. We analyzed denitrifier and
   NH3-oxidizer community structure (assessed by molecular analysis of
   functional genes nosZ and amoA) and potential denitrification and
   nitrification activities (function) across the soil hydrologic gradient.
   Soil moisture and physicochemical measurements, including organic-matter
   content, pH, inorganic N levels, and texture, varied along the gradient
   at each site. Denitrifier and NH3-oxidizer community composition and
   activity differed between upland and wetland plots at all sites.
   Denitrifier and NH3-oxidizer community composition were relatively
   constant through time, whereas microbial activity decreased at most
   sites from late spring to mid-August. Local environmental factors (e.g.,
   soil moisture, texture) contributed more to microbial function than
   microbial community composition or functional gene abundance.
   NH3-oxidizer community composition influenced potential nitrification
   rates more than denitrifier community composition influenced potential
   denitrification rates. This result suggests one way that microbial
   community composition could affect microbial function. Our ability to
   predict microbial responses to environmental change can be improved by
   understanding the context-dependence of microbial structure function
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{We present a two-phase model for a staff planning problem in a surgical
   department. We consider the setting where staff, in particular nurse
   circulators and surgical scrub technicians, are assigned to one of
   different service lines, and while they can be `pooled' and temporally
   assigned to other service line if needed, these re-assignments should
   belimited. In Phase I, we decide on the number of staff hours to budget
   for each service line, considering policies limiting staff pooling and
   overtime, and different demand scenarios. In Phase II, we determine how
   these budgeted staff hours should be allocated across potential work
   days and shifts, given estimated staff requirements and shift-related
   scheduling restrictions. We propose a heuristic to speed the model's
   Phase II solution time. We implement the model using a hospital's
   surgical data and compare the model's results with the hospital's
   current practices. Using a simulation model for the surgical operations,
   we find that our two-phase model reduces the delays caused by staff
   unavailability as well as staff pooling, without increasing the
   workforce size. Finally, we briefly describe a decision-support tool we
   developed with the objective of fine-tuning staff planning decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The cross-reactivity of T cells with pathogen-and self-derived peptides
   has been implicated as a pathway involved in the development of
   autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms that allow the clonal T cell
   antigen receptor (TCR) to functionally engage multiple peptide-major
   histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) are unclear. Here, we studied
   multiligand discrimination by a human, preproinsulin reactive, MHC
   class-I-restricted CD8(+) T cell clone (1E6) that can recognize over 1
   million different peptides. We generated high-resolution structures of
   the 1E6 TCR bound to 7 altered peptide ligands, including a
   pathogen-derived peptide that was an order of magnitude more potent than
   the natural self-peptide. Evaluation of these structures demonstrated
   that binding was stabilized through a conserved lock-and-key-like
   minimal binding footprint that enables 1E6 TCR to tolerate vast numbers
   of substitutions outside of this so-called hotspot. Highly potent
   antigens of the 1E6 TCR engaged with a strong antipathogen-like binding
   affinity; this engagement was governed though an energetic switch from
   an enthalpically to entropically driven interaction compared with the
   natural autoimmune ligand. Together, these data highlight how T cell
   cross-reactivity with pathogen-derived antigens might break
   self-tolerance to induce autoimmune disease.}},

Abstract = {{The ease of entering a car is one of the important ergonomic factors
   that car manufacturers consider during the process of car design. This
   has motivated many researchers to investigate factors that affect
   discomfort during ingress. The patterns of motion during ingress may be
   related to discomfort, but the analysis of motion is challenging. In
   this paper, a modeling framework is proposed to use the motions of body
   landmarks to predict subjectively reported discomfort during ingress.
   Foot trajectories are used to identify a set of trials with a consistent
   right-leg-first strategy. The trajectories from 20 landmarks on the
   limbs and torso are parameterized using B-spline basis functions. Two
   group selection methods, group non-negative garrote (GNNG) and stepwise
   group selection (SGS), are used to filter and identify the trajectories
   that are important for prediction. Finally, a classification and
   prediction model is built using support vector machine (SVM). The
   performance of the proposed framework is then evaluated against simpler,
   more common prediction models.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the surface topography of orthopedic implant
   materials is desired to improve osseointegration but is often at the
   expense of mechanical performance in load bearing environments. Here we
   investigate the effects of surface modifications, roughness and
   porosity, on the mechanical properties of a set of polymers with diverse
   chemistry and structure. Both roughness and surface porosity resulted in
   samples with lower strength, failure strain and fatigue life due to
   stress concentrations at the surface; however, the decrease in ductility
   and fatigue strength were greater than the decrease in monotonic
   strength. The fatigue properties of the injection molded polymers did
   not correlate with yield strength as would be traditionally observed in
   metals. Rather, the fatigue properties and the capacity to maintain
   properties with the introduction of surface porosity correlated with the
   fracture toughness of the polymers. Polymer structure impacted the
   materials relative capacity to maintain monotonic and cyclic properties
   in the face of surface texture and porosity. Generally, amorphous
   polymers with large ratios of upper to lower yield points demonstrated a
   more significant drop in ductility and fatigue strength with the
   introduction of porosity compared to crystalline polymers with smaller
   ratios in their upper to lower yield strength. The latter materials have
   more effective dissipation mechanisms to minimize the impact of surface
   porosity on both monotonic and cyclic damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1764-1775}},

Abstract = {{Bud formation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae must be coordinated with the
   nuclear cycle to enable successful proliferation. Many environmental
   stresses temporarily disrupt bud formation, and in such circumstances,
   the morphogenesis checkpoint halts nuclear division until bud formation
   can resume. Bud emergence is essential for degradation of the mitotic
   inhibitor, Swe1. Swe1 is localized to the septin cytoskeleton at the bud
   neck by the Swe1-binding protein Hsl7. Neck localization of Swe1 is
   required for Swe1 degradation. Although septins form a ring at the
   presumptive bud site before bud emergence, Hsl7 is not recruited to the
   septins until after bud emergence, suggesting that septins and/or Hsl7
   respond to a ``bud sensor.{''} Here we show that recruitment of Hsl7 to
   the septin ring depends on a combination of two septin-binding kinases:
   Hsl1 and Elm1. We elucidate which domains of these kinases are needed
   and show that artificial targeting of those domains suffices to recruit
   Hsl7 to septin rings even in unbudded cells. Moreover, recruitment of
   Elm1 is responsive to bud emergence. Our findings suggest that Elm1
   plays a key role in sensing bud emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial decomposition of soil carbon in high-latitude tundra underlain
   with permafrost is one of the most important, but poorly understood,
   potential positive feedbacks of greenhouse gas emissions from
   terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere in a warmer world(1-4). Using
   integrated metagenomic technologies, we showed that the microbial
   functional community structure in the active layer of tundra soil was
   significantly altered after only 1.5 years of warming, a rapid response
   demonstrating the high sensitivity of this ecosystem to warming. The
   abundances of microbial functional genes involved in both aerobic and
   anaerobic carbon decomposition were also markedly increased by this
   short-term warming. Consistent with this, ecosystem respiration (R-eco)
   increased up to 38\%. In addition, warming enhanced genes involved in
   nutrient cycling, which very likely contributed to an observed increase
   (30\%) in gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the GPP increase
   did not offset the extra R-eco, resulting in significantly more net
   carbon loss in warmed plots compared with control plots. Altogether, our
   results demonstrate the vulnerability of active-layer soil carbon in
   this permafrost-based tundra ecosystem to climatewarming and the

Title = {{Predicting older adults' perceptions about a computer system designed

Abstract = {{Although computer technology may be particularly useful for older adults
   (e.g., for communication and information access), they have been slower
   adopters than their younger counterparts. Perceptions about computers,
   such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, can pose
   barriers to acceptance and universal access (Davis in MIS Q
   13(3):319-340, 1989). Therefore, understanding the precursors to these
   perceptions for older adult non-computer users may provide insight into
   the reasons for their non-adoption. The authors examined the
   relationship between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of a
   computer interface designed for older users and demographic, technology
   experience, cognitive abilities, personality, and attitudinal variables
   in a sample of 300 non-computer-using adults between the ages 64 and 98,
   selected for being at high risk for social isolation. The strongest
   correlates of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were
   technology experience, personality dimensions of agreeableness and
   openness to experience, and attitudes. The emotional stability
   personality dimension was significantly correlated with perceived ease
   of use though not perceived usefulness. Hierarchical regression analysis
   revealed that attitudes (i.e., self-efficacy, comfort, and interest)
   remained predictive of perceptions of usefulness and ease of use when
   technology experience and personality variables were accounted for.
   Given that attitudes are more malleable than other variables, such as
   demographic and cognitive abilities, these findings highlight the
   potential to increase technology acceptance through positive
   experiences, appropriate training, and educational campaigns about the
   benefits of computers and other technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Surface esterification methods of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) using

   investigated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and C-13
   solid state NMR spectroscopy. Acid anhydride and CDI were found to be
   the most applicable reagents to graft short and long chain aliphatic
   carbons, respectively. The preservation of structural morphology and
   crystallinity of grafted CNCs were confirmed using transmission electron
   microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The hydrophobicity of grafted CNCs was
   evaluated by dispersing them in organic solvents with different Hansen's
   solubility parameters. The dispersibility of grafted CNCs in organic
   solvents was improved by using never-dried CNCs as source materials and
   keep CNCs wet in their washing solvents after grafting, thus increasing
   the solvency range to disperse CNCs.}},

Abstract = {{Low demand for safe water may partly result from a perceived distaste
   towards or the inconvenience of treatment methods. This paper analyzes
   preferences for water quality improvements in peri-urban Phnom Penh. The
   authors first analyze data from a discrete choice experiment in which
   respondents selected their preferred alternative from generic options
   varying in cost, taste acceptability, effectiveness against diarrhea and
   quantity of water treated. The choice patterns suggest that demand for
   water treatment is highly dependent on taste acceptability. The authors
   also use double-blinded taste tests to show that respondents are
   sensitive to one common taste in treated drinking water, that stemming
   from chlorine disinfection. While many compounds (natural and
   anthropogenic) may contribute to taste problems in drinking water, the
   lack of alignment between household preferences for taste and water
   safety may play a role in the low use of household water treatment
   methods in many settings.}},

Abstract = {{Low-rank matrices play a fundamental role in modeling and computational

   where low-rank matrices arise, these matrices cannot be fully sampled or

   provides an overview of modern techniques for exploiting low-rank
   structure to perform matrix recovery in these settings, providing a

Abstract = {{Air-writing refers to writing of linguistic characters or words in a
   free space by hand or finger movements. Air-writing differs from
   conventional handwriting; the latter contains the pen-up-pen-down
   motion, while the former lacks such a delimited sequence of writing
   events. We address air-writing recognition problems in a pair of
   companion papers. In Part I, recognition of characters or words is
   accomplished based on six-degree-of-freedom hand motion data. We address
   air-writing on two levels: motion characters and motion words. Isolated
   air-writing characters can be recognized similar to motion gestures
   although with increased sophistication and variability. For motion word
   recognition in which letters are connected and superimposed in the same
   virtual box in space, we build statistical models for words by
   concatenating clustered ligature models and individual letter models. A
   hidden Markov model is used for air-writing modeling and recognition. We
   show that motion data along dimensions beyond a 2-D trajectory can be
   beneficially discriminative for air-writing recognition. We investigate
   the relative effectiveness of various feature dimensions of optical and
   inertial tracking signals and report the attainable recognition
   performance correspondingly. The proposed system achieves a word error
   rate of 0.8\% for word-based recognition and 1.9\% for letter-based
   recognition. We also subjectively and objectively evaluate the
   effectiveness of air-writing and compare it with text input using a
   virtual keyboard. The words per minute of air-writing and virtual
   keyboard are 5.43 and 8.42, respectively.}},

   trajectory without delimitation. Detection of intended writing
   activities among superfluous finger movements unrelated to letters or
   words presents a challenge that needs to be treated separately from the
   traditional problem of pattern recognition. We first present a dataset
   that contains a mixture of writing and nonwriting finger motions in each
   recording. The LEAP from Leap Motion is used for marker-free and
   glove-free finger tracking. We propose a window-based approach that
   automatically detects and extracts the air-writing event in a continuous
   stream of motion data, containing stray finger movements unrelated to
   writing. Consecutive writing events are converted into a writing
   segment. The recognition performance is further evaluated based on the
   detected writing segment. Our main contribution is to build an
   air-writing system encompassing both detection and recognition stages
   and to give insights into how the detected writing segments affect the
   recognition result. With leave-one-out cross validation, the proposed
   system achieves an overall segment error rate of 1.15\% for word-based
   recognition and 9.84\% for letter-based recognition.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we use novel protocols based on spherical nanoindentation
   and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) to quantify the local changes
   in slip resistances in the grain boundary regions of deformed,
   polycrystalline aluminum. The new protocols involve the use of the
   recently developed methods for extracting indentation stress strain
   (ISS) curves from raw nanoindentation data in conjunction with the
   measurement of local microstructure at the indentation site using OIM to
   study the changes in the local slip resistances as a function of
   distance from the grain boundaries. Eight grain boundaries were selected
   for this work such that they included a broad range of boundaries,
   including low and high (grain-to-grain misorientation) angle boundaries
   as well as low, moderate, and high deviations in the Taylor factors of
   the grains on either side of the boundary. It was concluded that there
   was additional hardening in the grain boundary region when a Taylor
   `soft' grain was present next to a Taylor `hard' grain. This hardening
   was consistently observed on the soft grain side with one exception
   where hardening was observed on both sides of the boundary. A positive
   correlation was observed between the difference in Taylor factor across
   the boundary and the amount of hardening on the `soft' grain side.
   However, no correlation was observed between the grain-to-grain
   misorientation angle and the extent of hardening at the grain boundary.

Abstract = {{The characteristics of the MJO propagation across the Maritime Continent
   are investigated using a 20-yr reforecast dataset from the ECMWF
   ensemble prediction system. Analysis of the MJO events initialized over
   the Indian Ocean (phase 2) shows that the initial MJO amplitude and
   prediction skill relationship is not linear, particularly when the
   predictions start in moderate (between strong and weak) MJO amplitude
   category. To examine the key factors that determine the prediction
   skill, reforecasts in the moderate category are grouped into high-and
   low-skill events, and the differences in their ocean-atmospheric
   conditions as well as the physical processes during reforecast period
   are examined. The initial distribution of OLR anomalies in high-skill
   events shows a clear dipole pattern of convection with an enhanced
   convective anomalies over the Indian Ocean and strongly suppressed
   convective anomalies in the western Pacific Ocean. This dipole mode may
   support the MJO propagation across the Maritime Continent via the Rossby
   wave response and associated meridional moisture advection. Prominent
   ocean-atmosphere coupled processes are also simulated during the
   propagation of high-skill events. However, in low-skill events, the
   convective signal over the western Pacific is almost absent and less
   organized, and the ocean-atmosphere coupled processes are not simulated
   correctly. It is found that in both high- and low-skill events, the
   amplitude of the convective anomaly decreases significantly after about
   day 15, possibly due to the systematic mean model bias. A strong wet
   bias in the vicinity of the Maritime Continent, a cold SST bias in the
   equatorial Pacific, and associated circulation biases make the west
   Pacific area unfavorable for MJO propagation, thus limiting its
   prediction skill.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers can be used as temporary place holders in the fabrication of

   distinguished by chemical structure and decomposition temperature. The
   decomposition temperature ranges from over 400 degrees C to below room
   temperature in the case of low ceiling temperature polymers. Overcoat
   materials include silicon dioxide, polyimides, epoxy, and
   bis-benzocyclobutene (BCB). The methods of air-gap fabrication are
   discussed. Finally, the use of photoactive compounds in the patterning

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Fontan completion, resulting in a total cavopulmonary
   connection, is accomplished using a lateral tunnel, extracardiac
   conduit, or bifurcated Y-graft. The use of Y-grafts is hypothesized to
   provide symmetric hepatic blood flow distribution to the lungs, a factor
   related to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. The present study
   evaluates the hemodynamic performance of the largest commercially
   available Y-graft cohort to date, highlights 6 representative cases, and
   compares commercially available Y-graft performance with lateral
   tunnel/extracardiac conduit connections.
   Methods: A total of 30 patients with commercially available Y-grafts and
   30 patients with lateral tunnel/extracardiac conduits were analyzed.
   Total cavopulmonary connection anatomies and flow waveforms were
   reconstructed using cardiac magnetic resonance images and phase-contrast
   cardiac magnetic resonance. Computational fluid dynamic simulations were
   performed to quantify total cavopulmonary connection power loss,
   resistance, and hepatic flow distribution. Comparisons between graft
   types were investigated.
   Results: Total cavopulmonary connection resistance was significantly
   higher for Y-grafts. Hepatic flow distribution was similar overall but
   showed discrepancies at extreme values with more unbalanced flow in the
   Y-graft cohort. Power loss was more sensitive to left pulmonary artery
   stenosis in the Y-graft cohort. Prediction of Y-graft hepatic flow
   distribution is multifactorial.
   Conclusions: Commercially available Y-grafts do not inherently provide
   more balanced hepatic flow distribution than lateral tunnel/extracardiac
   conduit connections, which are more energetically favorable and less
   sensitive to pulmonary artery stenosis. Graft type should be considered
   on an individual basis because hemodynamic performance is based on a
   combination of factors, including pulmonary flow distribution, pulmonary
   artery stenosis, and superior vena cava positioning.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a novel fault tolerant leader-follower
   formation control scheme for a group of underactuated autonomous surface
   vessels with partially known control input gain functions, where the
   line-of-sight (LOS) range and angle tracking errors are required to be
   constrained. Both parametric system uncertainties with time-varying
   unknown functions and nonparametric system uncertainties satisfying
   norm-bounded conditions are discussed. To address LOS range and angle
   constraints and finite time convergence, time-varying tan-type barrier
   Lyapunov functions (BLFs) are incorporated with the control scheme. For
   the formation control, only measurements of LOS range and angle are used
   for control implementation, no other information about the leader is
   required. We show that under the proposed control method, despite the
   presence of actuator faults and system uncertainties, the formation
   tracking errors can converge into arbitrarily small neighborhoods around
   zero in finite time, while the constraint requirements on the LOS range
   and angle will not be violated. All closed loop signals are bounded.
   Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In light of recent earthquakes, structures damaged during an initial
   seismic event (mainshock) may be more vulnerable to severe damage and
   collapse during a subsequent event (aftershock). In this paper, a
   framework for the development of aftershock fragilities is presented;
   these aftershock fragilities define the likelihood that a bridge damaged
   during an initial event will exhibit a given damage state following one
   or more subsequent events. The framework is capable of (i) quantifying
   the cumulative damage of unrepaired bridges subjected to
   mainshock-aftershock sequences (effect of multiple earthquakes) and (ii)
   evaluating the effectiveness of column repair schemes such as steel and
   fiber-reinforced-polymer jackets (post-repair effect of jackets). To
   achieve this aim, the numerical model of repaired columns is validated
   using existing experimental results. A non-seismically designed bridge
   is chosen as a case study and is modeled for three numerical bridge
   models: a damaged (but unrepaired) bridge model, and two bridge models
   with columns repaired with steel and fiber-reinforced polymer jackets. A
   series of back-to-back dynamic analyses under successive earthquakes are
   performed for each level of existing damage. Using simulated results,
   failure probabilities of components for multiple limit states are
   computed for each bridge model and then are used to evaluate the
   relative vulnerability of components associated with cumulative damage
   and column repair. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for fast panoramic image generation using a
   rapidly moving robotic vision system. The proposed method consists of 1)
   real-time image deblurring within 30 frames/s, 2) dynamics-based

   visual-motor coordination and accelerating computation time. In this
   study, multiple images were obtained in the course of rapid motion,
   while a robotic vision system swept an environment. The vision system
   received blurry images that were recovered by real-time image
   deblurring. The resultant images were stitched together to generate a
   panorama image by the dynamics-based approach. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method was investigated under various motion conditions using a
   single-degree-of-freedom camera orientation system through quantitative
   and qualitative comparisons with conventional methods. Experiment
   results show that real-time performance within 30 frames/s was achieved
   for both image deblurring and image stitching for VGA-size images. The

Title = {{Learning Mixtures of Markov Chains from Aggregate Data with Structural

Abstract = {{Statistical models based on Markov chains, especially mixtures of Markov
   chains, have recently been studied and demonstrated to be effective in
   various data mining applications such as tourist flow analysis, animal
   migration modeling, and transportation administration. Nevertheless, the
   research so far has mainly focused on analyzing data at individual
   levels. Due to security and privacy reasons, however, the observations
   in practice usually consist of coarse-grained statistics of individual
   data, a.k.a. aggregate data, rendering learning mixtures of Markov
   chains an even more challenging problem. In this work, we show that this
   challenging problem, although intractable in its original form, can be
   solved approximately by posing structural constraints on the transition
   matrices. The proposed structural constraints include specifying active
   state sets corresponding to the chains and adding a pairwise sparse
   regularization term on transition matrices. Based on these two
   structural constraints, we propose a constrained least-squares method to
   learn mixtures of Markov chains. We further develop a novel iterative
   algorithm that decomposes the overall problem into a set of convex
   subproblems and solves each subproblem efficiently, making it possible
   to effectively learn mixtures of Markov chains from aggregate data. We
   propose a framework for generating synthetic data and analyze the
   complexity of our algorithm. Additionally, the empirical results of the
   convergence and the robustness of our algorithm are also presented.
   These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
   proposed algorithm, comparing with traditional methods. Experimental
   results on real-world data sets further validate that our algorithm can
   be used to solve practical problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of matching common node correspondences
   among multiple graphs referring to an identical or related structure.
   This multi-graph matching problem involves two correlated components: i)
   the local pairwise matching affinity across pairs of graphs; ii) the
   global matching consistency that measures the uniqueness of the pairwise
   matchings by different composition orders. Previous studies typically
   either enforce the matching consistency constraints in the beginning of
   an iterative optimization, which may propagate matching error both over
   iterations and across graph pairs; or separate affinity optimization and
   consistency enforcement into two steps. This paper is motivated by the
   observation that matching consistency can serve as a regularizer in the
   affinity objective function especially when the function is biased due
   to noises or inappropriate modeling. We propose composition-based
   multi-graph matching methods to incorporate the two aspects by
   optimizing the affinity score, meanwhile gradually infusing the
   consistency. We also propose two mechanisms to elicit the common inliers
   against outliers. Compelling results on synthetic and real images show
   the competency of our algorithms.}},

Title = {{Role of defects and metal coordination on adsorption of acid gases in

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{227}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) often display promising performance in
   ideal, one- or two component systems; however, industrial adsorption and
   catalytic applications are almost always in the presence of acid gases
   that degrade the adsorbent or catalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to
   understand the interaction of acid gases with MOFs to drive future
   material design. Acid gas adsorption has been widely investigated on
   metal oxides, while few fundamental studies exist for MOFs. Therefore,
   MOF-derived oxides were prepared to give insight into adsorbed species
   on MOFs by connecting to the understanding that exists for adsorbed
   species on metal oxides. These MOF-derived oxides retain the overall
   morphology of the parent MOF, allowing direct comparison of the effect
   of morphology and the metal coordination environment on adsorbed species
   and acid gas stability of MOF, MOF-derived oxide, and traditionally
   synthesized metal oxide. A cerium-based MOF with open-metal sites,
   CeBTC, and the Ti-based MIL-125 were chosen to prepare MOF-derived
   oxides. IR studies show that adsorbed species during SO2 and CO2
   adsorption on the MOF materials could be directly correlated to species
   observed on the MOF-derived and traditional oxides. In addition, the
   adsorbed species on the MOF-derived oxides differed from traditional
   oxides due to their different morphology and retained porosity. SEM and
   TEM images taken before and after CO2/SO2 adsorption experiments
   revealed degradation of all materials giving visual insight into the
   degradation mechanism after acid gas exposure. This study advances the
   understanding of acid gas adsorption on MOFs by correlation of adsorbed
   species with MOF-derived and traditional metal oxides. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition of
   permafrost-region soils during laboratory incubations}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Permafrost soils contain more than 1300 Pg of carbon (C), twice the
   amount of C in the atmosphere. Temperatures in higher latitudes are
   increasing, inducing permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial
   decomposition of previously frozen C, which will most likely feed back
   to climate warming through release of the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4.
   Understanding the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) and dynamics of soil
   organic matter (SOM) decomposition under warming is essential to predict
   the future state of the climate system. Alaskan tundra soils from the
   discontinuous permafrost zone were exposed to in situ experimental
   warming for two consecutive winters, increasing soil temperature by 2.3
   degrees C down to 40 cm in the soil profile. Soils obtained at three
   depths (0-15, 15-25 and 45-55 cm) from the experimental warming site
   were incubated under aerobic conditions at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C
   over 365 days in the laboratory. Carbon fluxes were measured
   periodically and dynamics of SOM decomposition, C pool sizes, and decay
   rates were estimated. Q(10) was estimated using both a short-term
   temperature manipulation (Q(10-ST)) performed at 14,100 and 280 days of
   incubation and via the equal C method (Q(10-EC), ratio of time taken for
   a soil to respire a given amount of degrees C), calculated continuously.
   At the same time points, functional diversities of the soil microbial
   communities were monitored for all incubation samples using a microbial
   functional gene array, GeoChip 5.0. Each array contains over 80,000
   probes targeting microbial functional genes involved in biogeochemical
   cycling of major nutrients, remediation strategies, pathogenicity and
   other important environmental functions. Of these, over 20,000 probes
   target genes involved in the degradation of varying C substrates and can
   be used, to quantify the relative gene abundances and functional gene
   diversities related to soil organic matter turnover. The slow
   decomposing C pool (C-S), which represented close to 95\% of total C in
   the top 25 cm soils, had a higher Q(10) than the fast decomposing C pool
   (C-F) and also dominated the total amount of C released by the end of
   the incubation. Overall, C-S had temperature sensitivities of Q(10-ST) =
   2.55 +/- 0.03 and Q(10-EC) = 2.19 +/- 0.13, while the CF had a
   temperature sensitivity of Q10-EC = 1.16 +/- 0.30. In contrast to the 15
   degrees C incubations, the 25 degrees C microbial communities showed
   reduced diversities of C-degradation functional genes in the early stage
   of the incubations. However, as the incubations continued the 25 degrees
   C communities more closely paralleled the 15 degrees C communities with
   respect to the detection of microbial genes utilized in the degradation
   of labile to recalcitrant C substrates. Two winter seasons of
   experimental warming did not affect the dynamics and temperature
   sensitivity of SOM decomposition or the microbial C-degradation genes
   during incubation. However, under the projected sustained warming
   attributable to climate change, we might expect increased contribution
   of C-S to organic matter decomposition. Because of the higher Q(10) and
   the large pool size of C-S, increased soil organic matter release under
   warmer temperatures will contribute towards accelerating climate change.

Abstract = {{Propionic acid (PA) and its salts are widely used in the food,
   pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. Microbial production of PA by
   propionibacteria is a typical product-inhibited process, and acid
   resistance is crucial in the improvement of PA titers and productivity.
   We previously identified two key acid resistance elementsthe arginine
   deaminase and glutamate decarboxylase systemsthat protect
   propionibacteria against PA stress by maintaining intracellular pH
   homeostasis. In this study, we attempted to improve the acid resistance
   and PA production of Propionibacterium jensenii ATCC 4868 by engineering
   these elements. Specifically, five genes (arcA, arcC, gadB, gdh, and
   ybaS) encoding components of the arginine deaminase and glutamate
   decarboxylase systems were overexpressed in P. jensenii. The activities
   of the five enzymes in the engineered strains were 26.7-489.0\% higher
   than those in wild-type P. jensenii. The growth rates of the engineered
   strains decreased, whereas specific PA production increased
   significantly compared with those of the wild-type strain. Among the
   overexpressed genes, gadB (encoding glutamate decarboxylase) increased
   PA resistance and yield most effectively; the PA resistance of P.
   jensenii-gadB was more than 10-fold higher than that of the wild-type
   strain, and the production titer, yield, and conversion ratio of PA
   reached 10.81g/L, 5.92g/g cells, and 0.56g/g glycerol, representing
   increases of 22.0\%, 23.8\%, and 21.7\%, respectively. We also
   investigated the effects of introducing these acid resistance elements
   on the transcript levels of related enzymes. The results showed that the
   expression of genes in the engineered pathways affected the expression
   of the other genes. Additionally, the intracellular pools of amino acids
   were altered as different genes were overexpressed, which may further
   contribute to the enhanced PA production. This study provides an
   effective strategy for improving PA production in propionibacteria; this
   strategy may be useful for the production of other organic acids.

Title = {{A molecular dynamics investigation into plastic deformation mechanism of
   nanocrystalline copper for different nanoscratching rates}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{66-76}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The plastic deformation mechanisms of nanoscratching process are
   investigated through the study of a rigid diamond tip sliding against
   nanocrystalline Cu using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Special
   attentions are paid to the scratching rate effects, as well as the
   crystal structural effects from single crystalline, polycrystalline and
   nanotwinned (NT) polycrystalline. With the increase of scratching rate,
   scratching force and workpiece temperature increase continuously due to
   severe plastic deformation and large chip volume, resulting in
   dislocation slip, GB slip, and twinning/detwinning. Scratching rate also
   governs the distributions of potential energy and kinetic energy of all
   the atoms, revealing the rate-dependent plastic deformation.
   Specifically, the plastic deformation for different scratching rates
   depends on the competition of scratching force, workpiece temperature
   and tool-workpiece contacting time that affect dislocation evolution. In
   addition, the results show that the plastic deformation due to
   scratching of single crystalline Cu is dominated by the
   dislocation-dislocation interactions. And the scratching induced plastic
   deformation of polycrystalline Cu is determined by the dislocation-grain
   boundary (GB) interactions. As for NT polycrystalline Cu under
   scratching, it is the dislocation-GB-twin boundary (TB) interactions
   accompanied with the twinning/detwinning process. While the presented MD
   simulations and the associated conclusions are based on nanocrystalline
   Cu, it is believed that the current deformation mechanism could also be
   applied to other face-centered-cubic nanocrystalline metals. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Critical heat flux (CHF) of the fluoroketone fluid FKE-774 in vertical
   microgap channels is explored, with a focus on submillimeter spacings.
   Experiments were conducted using a 20 mm x 20 mm heated aluminum
   surface. Microgap channel spacings were decreased down to 0.3 mm,
   providing channel aspect ratios (height/spacing) as high as 67. In the
   limit where channel spacing is large, CHF was found to be 140 kW/m(2)
   for saturated boiling at atmospheric pressure. A reduction in CHF of
   55\% was observed for the largest channel aspect ratio investigated.
   Results for degradation of the CHF limit with decreasing microgap
   spacing are compared to a correlation available in the literature and
   show a roughly hyperbolic dependence on channel aspect ratio
   (height/spacing) for aspect ratios larger than 10.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Abstract = {{Using computational simulations, we examine heat transfer enhancement in
   laminar flows through asymmetric wavy channels with sinusoidal walls.
   Specifically, we probe the influence of the amplitude and period of the
   wall waviness as well as the driving pressure on the enhancement of heat
   transfer for both steady and unsteady flows. Our simulations reveal that
   for the steady flow occurring at lower flow rates, the heat transfer
   enhancement is defined by the amplitude of the wall waviness. When the
   flow rate is increased and the flow transitions to unsteady, the heat
   transfer enhancement exhibits a stronger dependence on the pressure drop
   than the amplitude. We find that the increase in heat transfer achieved
   in the unsteady regime is significantly higher than that in the steady
   regime. Furthermore, we use a thermal-hydraulic performance factor to
   investigate if this enhancement outweighs the increased frictional
   losses the geometry induces. Our data indicates that wavy walled
   channels with small wave amplitudes outperform straight channels at
   Reynolds numbers as low as 300 and exhibit greater than 50\% improvement
   at Re approximate to 600. These results are important for designing
   compact heat exchangers capable of high performance in the laminar
   regime. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of thermal systems on the basis of the second law of
   thermodynamics has recently gained considerable attention. This is, in
   part, due to the fact that this approach along with the powerful tools
   of entropy generation and exergy destruction provides a unique method
   for the analysis of a variety of systems encountered in science and
   engineering. Further, in recent years there has been a surge of interest
   in the thermal analysis of conductive media which include solid
   structures. In this work, the recent advances in the second law analyses
   of these systems are reviewed with an emphasis on the theoretical and
   modeling aspects. The effects of including solid components on the
   entropy generation within different thermal systems are first discussed.
   The mathematical methods used in this branch of thermodynamics are,
   then, reviewed. This is followed by the conclusions regarding the
   existing challenges and opportunities for further research. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 is an effective
   technique to remove NOx from stationary sources, such as coal-fired
   power plant and industrial boilers. Some of elements in the fly ash
   deactivate the catalyst due to strong chemisorptions on the active
   sites. The poisons may act by simply blocking active sites or alter the
   adsorption behaviors of reactants and products by an electronic
   interaction. This review is mainly focused on the chemical poisoning on
   V2O5-based catalysts, environmental-benign catalysts and low temperature
   catalysts. Several common poisons including alkali/alkaline earth
   metals, SO2 and heavy metals etc. are referred and their poisoning
   mechanisms on catalysts are discussed. The regeneration methods of
   poisoned catalysts and the development of poison-resistance catalysts
   are also compared and analyzed. Finally, future research directions in
   developing poisoning resistance catalysts and facile efficient
   regeneration methods for SCR catalysts are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional finite-element method computational model has been

   the largest temperature gradients, and the design can be optimized to
   minimize those gradients in an iterative way through multiple
   simulations. The model also allows for a drastic reduction in time for
   new design iterations of the physical termination with optimal thermal
   and fluid characteristics. This paper presents the details of the
   modeling methodology, and the results are compared with experimental

Volume = {{345}},
Pages = {{156-176}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Measuring or estimating the number of errors in (i.e., violations to) a
   functional dependency (FD) offers valuable information about data
   semantics and quality. Most existing work focuses on FD error estimation
   in a centralized environment, where data are stored only in one site and
   the goal is to optimize the time and space complexities of the
   estimation algorithms. The distributed FD error estimation problem, in
   which the data can reside in multiple physically distributed sites, has
   never been studied in depth and is the subject of this work. In this
   work, we study a version of the distributed FD error estimation problem
   where a coordinator site communicates with multiple remote sites for
   arriving at such estimations, and the goal is to minimize this
   communication cost. We study two types of queries-that are dual to each
   other in semantics-for such estimations: one tries to maximize the
   accuracies of FD error estimations under fixed communication costs, and
   the other to minimize the communication costs needed to meet certain
   accuracy requirements. In our framework, each remote site maintains a
   concise synopsis data structure obtained by scanning its local data
   once, and the coordinator site receives and processes all such data
   structures to arrive at an estimate of the FD error. Our solution
   extends from the case of two remote sites to that of multiple remote
   sites. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques via
   rigorous analysis and extensive experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Wettability control of stainless steel surfaces has wide applicability
   due to the extensive use of stainless steels in industries that handle
   liquids. However, previous studies to achieve hydrophobicity on

   modified surface. In this study, water-repellent stainless steel
   surfaces were fabricated via the controlled topographical enhancement of
   intrinsic grain structures to achieve the required surface roughness.
   Electrochemical etching was used to control the relative etch rate
   between grains and grain boundaries by applying an anodic potential to
   stainless steel 316 (SS316). At low potential (1.2 V vs. Saturated
   Calomel Electrode), high selectivity between grain and grain boundary
   etching was observed, which resulted in significant etching at grain
   boundaries and smooth top grain surfaces. Morphologies with significant
   microscale roughness, and slight nanoscale roughness, were achieved with
   intermediate applied potentials (1.3-1.5 V). As the potential increased
   further (1.8 V), etch selectivity decreased and yielded microscopically
   smooth surfaces with sponge-like nanoscale roughness; at even higher
   potentials (2.4 V), electro-polishing was observed with surfaces that
   are smooth at the nanoscale. Based upon the relationship between anodic
   potential and topography, we designed a nano/microscale hierarchical
   SS316 surface by a two-step electrochemical etching combining low and
   high anodic potentials. The hierarchical SS316 surface resulted in a
   water contact angle of 137.5 +/- A 5.0A degrees. Plasma-assisted
   deposition of a fluorocarbon film further reduced the wettability, with
   a contact angle of 163.9 +/- A 1.2A degrees and a roll-off angle of 10.7
   +/- A 1.8A degrees for 4 mu L water droplets, thereby rendering the
   modified SS316 surfaces superhydrophobic. Due to the inherently robust
   intrinsic grain structure of SS, we expect that this simple approach to
   generate water-repellent SS316 surfaces will display improved mechanical
   robustness relative to previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{One dimensional (1D) magnetic nanowires show unique magnetic behaviors,
   such as large coercivity and high remanence, in comparison to the bulk
   and thin film materials. Here, planar arrays of Co nanowires, nanorods
   and nanoparticles were fabricated from thin Co films by a nanosecond
   pulsed laser interference irradiation technique. Magnetic force
   microscopy (MFM) and surface magneto -optic Kerr effect (SMOKE)
   techniques were used to study the individual and average magnetic
   properties of the nanostructures. Magnetic domain orientation was found
   to depend on the in -plane aspect ratio of the nanostructure. The
   magnetic orientation was out -of -plane for in -plane aspect ratio
   ranging from 1 to 1.4 and transitioned to an in -plane orientation for
   aspect ratios greater than 1.4 (such as in nanorods and nanowires). Our
   results also showed that polycrystalline Co nanowires showed much higher
   coercivity and remanence as compared to bulk and thin film materials, as
   well as shapes with smaller aspect ratio. This result was attributed
   mainly to the shape anisotropy. This study demonstrated that nanosecond
   pulsed laser synthesis is capable of fabricating various nanostructures
   in a simple, robust and rapid manner and SMOKE is a reliable technique
   to rapidly characterize such magnetic nanostructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) compatible
   single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) voltage regulation module that
   enables smaller passives for a given output power, while maintaining
   power quality (low output ripple), suppressing cross regulation, and
   improving efficiency at high switching frequency. First,
   continuous-conduction mode (CCM) operation is utilized to deliver higher
   output power for a smaller inductance; the cross-regulation in CCM
   operation is suppressed using a novel power-weighted CCM controller.
   Second, a modified power stage filter is presented using floating
   capacitors that utilize the Miller effect to reduce the switching
   frequency of the output, while maintaining the power quality. The
   operating principles, stability, and circuit level design of the
   proposed SIMO VR are presented. The design is demonstrated through a
   130-nm CMOS test chip that generates four outputs, each ranging from 200
   to 600 mV, from a 1.2-V input. The measurements demonstrate a 20-MHz
   operation, the pulse width modulation signal of the power stage with
   500-nH inductor, and 1-mu F total load capacitance, while delivering a
   output power density of 150 mW/mu H.mu F. The test chip demonstrates DVS
   speed of 120 mV/mu s, 73\% peak efficiency at a load of 40 mA, and as
   high as 40\% efficiency improvement using the modified power filer.}},

Abstract = {{The flexural properties of ultrathin freely standing composite
   nanomembranes from reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNC) have been probed by combining force spectroscopy for
   local nanomechanical properties and bulging test for global mechanical
   properties. We observed that the flexural properties of these rGO CNC
   nanomembranes are controlled by rGO content and deformational regimes.
   The nanomembranes showed the enhanced mechanical properties due to the
   strong interfacial interactions between interwoven rGO and CNC
   components. The presence of weak interfacial interactions resulted in
   time-dependent behavior with the relaxation time gradually decreased
   with increasing the deformational rate owing to the reducing viscous
   damping at faster probing regimes close to 10 Hz. We observed that the
   microscopic elastic bending modulus of 141 GPa from local force
   spectroscopy is close to the elastic tensile modulus evaluated from
   macroscopic bulging test, indicating the consistency of both approaches
   for analyzing the ultrathin nanomembranes at different spatial scales of
   deformation. We showed that the flexible rGO CNC nanomembranes are very
   resilient in terms of their capacity to recover back into original

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{With plenty of unique porous structure at micro-/nano scale,
   hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) are promising for usage in advanced
   electric double layer supercapacitors (EDLCs) as the electrode
   materials. However, wide-range adoption of HPC for practical application
   is largely shadowed by its extremely complex synthesis process with
   considerably low production efficiency. Herein we reported a simple
   template-free, one-step sintering method, to massively produce the HPCs
   for high-performance EDLCs. Resorting to the 3D structure modification
   of the wide pore size distribution, high surface area of HPCs (up to
   3000 m(2) g(-1)) was achieved. By using 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte, the
   as-fabricated HPCs based EDLCs can be operated reversibly over a wide
   voltage window of 1.6 V with superior specific capacitance of 240 F
   g(-1) under a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). In the meanwhile, the
   EDLCs exhibit excellent rate capability (high power density of 16 kW
   kg(-1) at 10.2 Wh kg(-1)) and long-term cycling stability with 9\% loss
   of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. This output performance
   distinguished itself among most of the carbon-based EDLCs with neutral
   aqueous electrolyte. Thus, the template-free one-step sintering method
   produced HPCs for EDLCs represents a new approach for high-performance
   energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Higher-order local and non-local correlations for 1D strongly
   interacting Bose gas}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{The correlation function is an important quantity in the physics of
   ultracold quantum gases because it provides information about the
   quantum many-body wave function beyond the simple density profile. In
   this paper we first study the M-body local correlation functions, g(M),
   of the one-dimensional (1D) strongly repulsive Bose gas within the
   Lieb-Liniger model using the analytical method proposed by Gangardt and
   Shlyapnikov (2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 010401; 2003 New J. Phys. 5 79).
   In the strong repulsion regime the 1D Bose gas at low temperatures is
   equivalent to a gas of ideal particles obeying the non-mutual
   generalized exclusion statistics with a statistical parameter alpha = 1
   - 2/gamma, i.e. the quasimomenta of N strongly interacting bosons map to
   the momenta of N free fermions via k(i) approximate to alpha k(i)(F)
   with i = 1,..., N. Here. is the dimensionless interaction strength
   within the Lieb-Liniger model. We rigorously prove that such a
   statistical parameter a solely determines the sub-leading order
   contribution to the M-body local correlation function of the gas at
   strong but finite interaction strengths. We explicitly calculate the
   correlation functions g(M) in terms of. and a at zero, low, and
   intermediate temperatures. For M = 2 and 3 our results reproduce the
   known expressions for g(2) and g(3) with sub-leading terms (see for
   instance (Vadim et al 2006 Phys. Rev. A 73 051604(R); Kormos et al 2009
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 210404; Wang et al 2013 Phys. Rev. A 87 043634). We
   also express the leading order of the short distance non-local
   correlation functions <Psi(dagger)(x(1))... Psi(dagger)(x(M)) Psi(y(M))
   ... Psi(y(1))> of the strongly repulsive Bose gas in terms of the wave
   function of Mbosons at zero collision energy and zero total momentum.
   Here Y(x) is the boson annihilation operator. These general formulas of
   the higher-order local and non-local correlation functions of the 1D
   Bose gas provide new insights into the many body physics.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how bleaching impacts the settlement of symbiotic habitat
   specialists and whether there is flexibility in settlement choices with
   regard to habitat quality is essential given our changing climate. We
   used five anemonefishes (Amphiprion clarkii, Amphiprion latezonatus,
   Amphiprion ocellaris, Amphiprion percula and Premnas biaculeatus) and
   three host sea anemones (Entacmaea quadricolor, Heteractis crispa and
   Heteractis magnifica) in paired-choice flume experiments to determine
   whether habitat naive juveniles have the olfactory capabilities to
   distinguish between unbleached and bleached hosts, and how this may
   affect settlement decisions. All anemonefishes were able to distinguish
   between bleached and unbleached hosts, and responded only to chemical
   cues from species-specific host anemones irrespective of health status,
   indicating a lack of flexibility in host use. While bleached hosts were
   selected as habitat, this occurred only when unbleached options were
   unavailable, with the exception of A. latezonatus, which showed strong
   preferences for H. crispa regardless of health. This study highlights
   the potential deleterious indirect impacts of declining habitat quality
   during larval settlement in habitat specialists, which could be
   important in the field, given that bleaching events are becoming
   increasingly common.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid Class 1/Class 2 supported amine CO2 sorbents demonstrate superior
   performance under practical steam conditions, yet their amine
   immobilization and stabilization mechanisms are unclear. Uncovering the
   interactions responsible for the sorbents' robust features is critical
   for further improvements and can facilitate practical applications. We
   employ solid state Si-29 CP-MAS and 2-D FSLG H-1-C-13 CP HETCOR NMR
   spectroscopies to probe the overall molecular interactions of
   aminosilane/silica, polyamine {[}poly(ethylenimine), PEI]/silica, and
   hybrid aminosilane/PEI/silica sorbents. A unique, sequential
   impregnation sorbent preparation method is executed in a diffuse
   reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) setup to
   decouple amine binding mechanisms at the amine silica interfacefrom
   those within bulk amine layers. These mechanisms are correlated with
   each sorbents' resistance to accelerated liquid H2O and TGA steam
   treatments (H2O stability) and to oxidative degradation (thermal
   stability). High percentages of CO2 capture retained (PCR) and organic
   content retained (OCR) values after H2O testing of
   N-(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)ethylenediamine (TMPED)/PEI and
   (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS)/PEI hybrid sorbents are
   associated with a synergistic stabilizing effect of the amine species
   observed during oxidative degradation (thermal gravimetric
   analysis-differential scanning calorimetry, TGA-DSC). Solid state NMR
   spectroscopy reveals that the synergistic effect of the TMPED/PEI
   mixture is manifested by the formation of hydrogen-bonded PEI NH2 center
   dot center dot center dot NH2 TMPED and PEI NH2 HO Si/O Si-O (TMPED,
   T-2) linkages within the sorbent. DRIFTS further determines that PEI
   enhances the grafting of TMPED to silica and that PEI is dispersed among
   a stable network of polymerized TMPED in the bulk, utilizing H-bonded
   linkages. These findings provide the scientific basis for establishing a
   Class 4 category for aminosilane/polyamine/silica hybrid sorbents.}},

Abstract = {{We present a rational approach to fabricating plasmonically active
   hybrid polymer-metal nanomaterials with electrochemical tunability of
   the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of noble metal
   nanostructures embedded in an electroactive polymer matrix. The key
   requirement for being able to significantly modulate the LSPR band
   position is a close overlap between the refractive index change {[}Delta
   n(lambda)] of a stimuli-responsive polymeric matrix and the intrinsic
   LSPR bands. For this purpose, gold nanorods with a controlled aspect
   ratio, synthesized to provide high refractive index sensitivity while
   maintaining good oxidative stability, were combined with a
   solution-processable electroactive and electrochromic polymer (ECP):
   alkoxy-substituted poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene)
   {[}PProDOT(CH(2)OEtHx)(2)]. Spectral characteristics of the ECP, in
   particular the Delta n(lambda) variation, were evaluated as the material
   was switched between oxidized and reduced states. We fabricated
   ultrathin plasmonic electrochromic hybrid films consisting of gold
   nanorods and ECP that exhibited a large, stable, and reversible LSPR
   modulation of up to 25-30 nm with an applied electrical potential.
   Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm a good match
   between the experimentally measured refractive index change in the ECP
   and the plasmonic response during electrochemical modulations.}},

Abstract = {{Acid-catalyzed decomposition of dicumyl peroxide in dodecane from 60 to

   products. Pseudo-first-order rate constants were determined as a
   function of the temperature for the reaction of DCP with
   dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid in dodecane and resulted in an Arrhenius
   plot exhibiting two distinct kinetic regimes with differing activation
   energies: 76.9 kJ/mol at low temperatures (measured from 60 to 90
   degrees C) and 8.50 kJ/mol at higher temperatures (measured from 90 to
   130 degrees C). With employment of a combination of kinetics, product
   analysis, and trapping experiments, evidence is presented to show the
   intermediacy of cumene hydroperoxide a reactive intermediate absent from
   previous mechanistic descriptions of this process. The yield of cumene
   hydro peroxide production is discussed, and the mechanistic pathways for
   formation of the observed products are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) are able to convert mechanical
   energy into electricity. In this work, a self-powered electrochemical
   synthesis circle is designed, in which the electrode material of the
   TENG, polypyrrole (PPy), is prepared by the pulse output of the
   PPy-based TENG itself. The TENG based on PPy from self-powered synthesis
   (SPSPPy) presents a competitive performance compared to those made from
   commercial pulse sources. A supercapacitor that is fabricated from
   SPSPPy has a far superior performance than that synthesized by the
   conventional galvanostatic method. Furthermore, a self-charging power
   system that integrates a TENG and a supercapacitor is demonstrated to
   drive an electronic device sustainably. Moreover, the polymerization
   efficiency is optimized in TENG-based electrochemical synthesis because
   its high voltage can sustain multiple reactors simultaneously. Its upper
   limit is theoretically analyzed for optimal energy utility, and a
   maximum number of 39 reactors can be powered experimentally. Hence, TENG
   is validated as an effective pulse generator for the synthesis of PPy as
   well as other electrochemical technology, and this work greatly improves
   the understandings of TENG-based self-powered electrochemical systems.}},

Abstract = {{How do funding agencies ramp-up their capabilities to support research
   in a rapidly emerging area? This paper addresses this question through a
   comparison of research proposals awarded by the US National Science
   Foundation (NSF) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China
   (NSFC) in the field of Big Data. Big data is characterized by its size
   and difficulties in capturing, curating, managing and processing it in
   reasonable periods of time. Although Big Data has its legacy in
   longstanding information technology research, the field grew very
   rapidly over a short period. We find that the extent of
   interdisciplinarity is a key aspect in how these funding agencies
   address the rise of Big Data. Our results show that both agencies have
   been able to marshal funding to support Big Data research in multiple
   areas, but the NSF relies to a greater extent on multi-program funding
   from different fields. We discuss how these interdisciplinary approaches
   reflect the research hot-spots and innovation pathways in these two
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of an increase in atmospheric aerosol concentrations on the
   distribution and radiative properties of Earth's clouds is the most
   uncertain component of the overall global radiative forcing from
   preindustrial time. General circulation models (GCMs) are the tool for
   predicting future climate, but the treatment of aerosols, clouds, and
   aerosol-cloud radiative effects carries large uncertainties that
   directly affect GCM predictions, such as climate sensitivity.
   Predictions are hampered by the large range of scales of interaction
   between various components that need to be captured. Observation systems
   (remote sensing, in situ) are increasingly being used to constrain
   predictions, but significant challenges exist, to some extent because of
   the large range of scales and the fact that the various measuring
   systems tend to address different scales. Fine-scale models represent
   clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions with high fidelity but
   do not include interactions with the larger scale and are therefore
   limited from a climatic point of view. We suggest strategies for
   improving estimates of aerosol-cloud relationships in climate models,
   for new remote sensing and in situ measurements, and for quantifying and
   reducing model uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how dynamical and aerosol inputs affect the temporal
   variability of hydrometeor formation in climate models will help to
   explain sources of model diversity in cloud forcing, to provide robust
   comparisons with data, and, ultimately, to reduce the uncertainty in
   estimates of the aerosol indirect effect. This variability attribution
   can be done at various spatial and temporal resolutions with metrics
   derived from online adjoint sensitivities of droplet and crystal number
   to relevant inputs. Such metrics are defined and calculated from
   simulations using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version
   5 (GEOS-5) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community
   Atmosphere Model Version 5.1 (CAM5.1). Input updraft velocity
   fluctuations can explain as much as 48\% of temporal variability in
   output ice crystal number and 61\% in droplet number in GEOS-5 and up to
   89\% of temporal variability in output ice crystal number in CAM5.1. In
   both models, this vertical velocity attribution depends strongly on
   altitude. Despite its importance for hydrometeor formation, simulated
   vertical velocity distributions are rarely evaluated against
   observations due to the sparsity of relevant data. Coordinated effort by
   the atmospheric community to develop more consistent, observationally
   based updraft treatments will help to close this knowledge gap.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the development of novel binary and ternary oxide/Torlon
   hollow fiber composites comprising zirconia, titania, and silica as

   Ti-Si/PAI-HF) and ternary (Zr-Ti-Si/PAI-HF) composites were then
   functionalized with monoamine-, diamine-, and triamine-substituted
   trialkoxysilanes and were evaluated in CO2 capture. Although the
   introduction of both Zr and Ti improved the CO2 adsorption capacity
   relative to that with Si/PAI-HF sorbents, zirconia was found to have a
   more favorable effect on the CO2 adsorption performance than titania, as
   previously demonstrated for amine sorbents in the powder form. The
   Zr-Ti-Si/PAI-HF sample with an oxide content of 20 wt\% was found to
   exhibit a relatively high CO2 capacity, that is, 1.90 mmol g(-1) at
   atmospheric pressure under dry conditions, owing to more favorable
   synergy between the metal oxides and CO2. The ternary fiber sorbent
   showed improved sorption kinetics and long-term stability in cyclic

   Factors influencing the overall stress and stress gradient are

Abstract = {{Transparent glass ceramics with embedded light-emitting nanocrystals
   show great potential as low-cost nanocomposite scintillators in
   comparison to single crystal and transparent ceramic scintillators. In
   this study, cubic structure BaGdF5: Tb nanocrystals embedded in an
   aluminosilicate glass matrix are reported for potential high performance
   MeV imaging applications. Scintillator samples with systematically
   varied compositions were prepared by a simple conventional
   melt-quenching method followed by annealing. Optical, structural and
   scintillation properties were characterized to guide the design and
   optimization of selected material systems, aiming at the development of
   a system with higher crystal volume and larger crystal size for improved
   luminosity. It is observed that enhanced scintillation performance was
   achieved by tuning the glass matrix composition and using GdF3 in the
   raw materials, which served as a nucleation agent. A 26\% improvement in
   light output was observed from a BaGdF5: Tb glass ceramic with addition
   of GdF3.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical-electrical coupling properties of piezoelectric
   semiconductors endow these materials with novel device applications in
   microelectromechanical systems, sensors, human-computer interfaces, etc.
   When an applied strain is exerted on a piezoelectric semiconductor,
   piezoelectric charges are generated at the surface or interface of the
   semiconductor, which can be utilized to control the electronic transport
   characteristics. This is the fundamental working mechanism of
   piezotronic devices, called the piezotronic effect. In the present
   report, a series of piezotronic transistors composed of different
   electrode metals and semiconductors is examined using density functional
   theory calculation. It is found that the influence of semiconductors on
   the piezotronic effect is larger than the impact of metals, and GaN and
   CdS are promising candidates for piezotronic and piezo-phototronic
   devices, respectively. The width of the piezoelectric charge
   distribution obtained in the present study can be used as a parameter in
   classical finite-element-method based simulations, which provide
   guidance on designing high-performance piezotronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals are distinct from thermotropic

   P-400 >) order, of sunset yellow FCF aqueous solutions, measured using
   polarized Raman spectroscopy for different concentrations. The order
   parameter increases with the concentration, and their values are high in
   comparison with those of thermotropic liquid crystals. On the basis of
   Raman spectroscopy, we provide the strongest evidence yet that the
   hydrozone tautomer of SSY is the predominant form in aqueous solutions
   in the isotropic, nematic, and columnar phases, as well as what we
   believe to be the first measurements of (< F-400 >) for this system.}},

Title = {{High Purity Tungsten Nanostructures via Focused Electron Beam Induced
   Deposition with Carrier Gas Assisted Supersonic Jet Delivery of

Abstract = {{A substantially enhanced purity of tungsten nanostructures, with up to
   95\% of metal content relative to carbon contaminants with no
   postprocessing, is achieved by using a supersonic inert carrier gas jet
   in the continuum flow regime to deliver the organometallic precursor for
   focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Through impact
   enhanced desorption of residual organic ligands at the deposition site,
   high kinetic energy of the gas jet assists in completing the secondary
   electron induced dissociation of precursor molecules, resulting in both
   increased metal purity and enhanced deposit growth rate. The inert gas
   jet at low Knudsen numbers also serves as a carrier gas to increase
   precursor flux to the substrate. Operating in the continuum flow regime
   reduces jet spreading and allows the use of smaller diameter nozzles to
   increase localization of precursor delivery to the deposition site. This
   drastic increase in localized precursor flux to the substrate is shown
   to compensate for the diminished sticking coefficient resulting from an
   increased impingement velocity of the continuum-flow gas jet relative to
   a molecular-flow gas jet. Increasing the jet temperature increases the
   delivered kinetic energy and allows tuning the balance between enhanced
   ligand contaminant desorption to increase deposit purity and the reduced
   sticking coefficient, resulting in the net increase of pure metal growth
   rate. Relevant physical mechanisms are discussed with support of
   experimental observations and multiscale numerical simulations of the
   gas jet, comparing the conventional molecular gas flow versus continuum
   gas flow. Collectively, our results suggest a promising path forward for
   delivery of organometallic precursors in gas phase that results in high
   purity metal deposition without sacrificing the high growth rate.}},

Abstract = {{Surface charging phenomena in nonpolar dispersions are exploited in a
   wide range of industrial applications, but their mechanistic
   understanding lags far behind. We investigate the surface charging of a
   variety of polymer particles with different surface functionality in
   alkane solutions of a custom-synthesized and purified polyisobutylene
   succinimide (PIBS) poly amine surfactant and a related commercial
   surfactant mixture commonly used to control particle charge. We find
   that the observed electrophoretic particle mobility cannot be explained
   exclusively by donor acceptor interactions between surface functional
   groups and surfactant polar moieties. Our results instead suggest an
   interplay of multiple charging pathways, which likely include the
   competitive adsorption of ions generated among inverse micelles in the
   solution bulk. We discuss possible factors affecting the competitive
   adsorption of micellar ions, such as the chemical nature of the particle
   bulk material and the size asymmetry between inverse micelles of
   opposite charge.}},

Abstract = {{Alginate is a biopolymer with favorable pH-sensitive properties for oral
   delivery of peptides and proteins. However, conventional alginate
   nanogels have limitations such as low encapsulation efficiency because
   of drug CaCl, leaching during bead preparation and burst release in high
   pH values. These shortcomings originate from large pore size of the
   nanogels. In this work, we proposed an on-chip hydrodynamic flow
   focusing approach for synthesis of alginate nanogels with adjustable
   pore size to achieve fine-tunable release profile of the encapsulated
   bioactive agents. It is demonstrated that the microstructure of nanogels
   can be controlled through adjusting flow ratio and mixing time directed
   on microfluidic platforms consisting of cross-junction microchannels. In
   this study, the average pore size of alginate nanogels (i.e., average
   molecular weight between cross-links, M-c) was related to synthesis
   parameters. M-c was calculated from equations based on equilibrium
   swelling theory and proposed methods to modify the theory for
   pH-sensitive nanogels. In the equations we derived, size and compactness
   of nanogels are key factors, which can be adjusted by controlling the
   flow ratio. It was found that increase in flow ratio increases the size
   of nanogels and decreases their compactness. The size of on-chip
   generated nanogels for flow ratio of 0.02-0.2 was measured to be in the
   range of 68-138 nm. Moreover, a method based on the Mie theory was
   implemented to estimate the aggregation number (N-agg) of polymer chains
   inside the nanogels as an indicator of compactness. According to the
   size and compactness results along with equations of modified swelling
   theory, M-c obtained to be in the range of 0.5-0.8 kDa. The proposed
   method could be considered as a promising approach for efficient
   polypeptides encapsulation and their sustained release.}},

Abstract = {{T cells are triggered when the T-cell receptor (TCR) encounters its
   antigenic ligand, the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC),
   on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). Because T cells are
   highly migratory and antigen recognition occurs at an intermembrane
   junction where the T cell physically contacts the APC, there are
   long-standing questions of whether T cells transmit defined forces to
   their TCR complex and whether chemomechanical coupling influences immune
   function. Here we develop DNA-based gold nanoparticle tension sensors to
   provide, to our knowledge, the first pN tension maps of individual
   TCR-pMHC complexes during T-cell activation. We show that naive T cells
   harness cytoskeletal coupling to transmit 12-19 pN of force to their
   TCRs within seconds of ligand binding and preceding initial calcium
   signaling. CD8 coreceptor binding and lymphocyte-specific kinase
   signaling are required for antigen-mediated cell spreading and force
   generation. Lymphocyte functionassociated antigen 1 (LFA-1) mediated
   adhesion modulates TCR-pMHC tension by intensifying its magnitude to
   values >19 pN and spatially reorganizes the location of TCR forces to
   the kinapse, the zone located at the trailing edge of migrating T cells,
   thus demonstrating chemomechanical crosstalk between TCR and LFA-1
   receptor signaling. Finally, T cells display a dampened and poorly
   specific response to antigen agonists when TCR forces are chemically
   abolished or physically ``filtered{''} to a level below similar to 12 pN
   using mechanically labile DNA tethers. Therefore, we conclude that T
   cells tune TCR mechanics with pN resolution to create a checkpoint of
   agonist quality necessary for specific immune response.}},

   11, 2016; doi: 10.1152/ajpgi. 00318.2015.-Dietary lipids are transported
   from the intestine through contractile lymphatics. Chronic lipid loads
   can adversely affect lymphatic function. However, the acute lymphatic
   pump response in the mesentery to a postprandial lipid meal has gone
   unexplored. In this study, we used the rat mesenteric collecting vessel
   as an in vivo model to quantify the effect of lipoproteins on vessel
   function. Lipid load was continuously monitored by using the intensity
   of a fluorescent fatty-acid analog, which we infused along with a fat
   emulsion through a duodenal cannula. The vessel contractility was
   simultaneously quantified. We demonstrated for the first time that
   collecting lymphatic vessels respond to an acute lipid load by reducing
   pump function. High lipid levels decreased contraction frequency and
   amplitude. We also showed a strong tonic response through a reduction in
   the end-diastolic and systolic diameters. We further characterized the
   changes in flow rate and viscosity and showed that both increase
   postprandially. In addition, shear-mediated Ca2+ signaling in lymphatic
   endothelial cells differed when cultured with lipoproteins. Together
   these results show that the in vivo response could be both shear and
   lipid mediated and provide the first evidence that high postprandial
   lipid has an immediate negative effect on lymphatic function even in the
   acute setting.}},

   Analysis shows that the phase dimensions remain largely independent of

Abstract = {{Eutectic solidification gives rise to a number of distinct
   microstructure patterns that might include lamella, rods and labyrinths
   in binary alloys. However, as the number of phases and components
   increases, the number of possible patterns that might be obtained during
   bulk solidification also become larger. While the morphological
   attributes of binary eutectic solidification have been fairly well
   understood, the same is not true for ternary and higher multicomponent
   alloys. In this paper, we study and quantify microstructures in ternary
   alloys as a function of two essential parameters, namely, the volume
   fraction of the solid phases and the surface energies of the interfaces
   (in particular the solid liquid interfaces). For the selected ensemble
   of microstructures, quantification and classification were carried out
   using a recently developed data-driven (objective) approach based on
   principal component analyses of 2-point correlations. It is demonstrated
   that the method is capable of analyzing and quantifying the
   similarity/difference measures between the elements of the selected
   ensemble of microstructures. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Prior exposure to stress is a risk factor for developing
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to trauma, yet the
   mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. Using a rodent model of
   stress-based susceptibility to PTSD, we investigated the role of
   serotonin in this phenomenon.
   METHODS: Adult mice were exposed to repeated immobilization stress or
   handling, and the role of serotonin in subsequent fear learning was
   assessed using pharmacologic manipulation and western blot detection of
   serotonin receptors, measurements of serotonin, high-speed optogenetic
   silencing, and behavior.
   RESULTS: Both dorsal raphe serotonergic activity during aversive
   reinforcement and amygdala serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) activity
   during memory consolidation were necessary for stress enhancement of
   fear memory, but neither process affected fear memory in unstressed
   mice. Additionally, prior stress increased amygdala sensitivity to
   serotonin by promoting surface expression of 5-HT2CR without affecting
   tissue levels of serotonin in the amygdala. We also showed that the
   serotonin that drives stress enhancement of associative cued fear memory
   can arise from paired or unpaired footshock, an effect not predicted by
   theoretical models of associative learning.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stress bolsters the consequences of aversive reinforcement,
   not by simply enhancing the neurobiological signals used to encode fear
   in unstressed animals, but rather by engaging distinct mechanistic
   pathways. These results reveal that predictions from classical
   associative learning models do not always hold for stressed animals and
   suggest that 5-HT2CR blockade may represent a promising therapeutic
   target for psychiatric disorders characterized by excessive fear
   responses such as that observed in PTSD.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{309}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Chelated coppers, such as Cu-II-EDTA, are characteristically refractory
   and difficult to break down because of their high stability and
   solubility. Cu-II-EDTA sequestration by structural Fe(II) (=Fe(II)) was
   investigated intensively in this study. Up to 101.21 mgCu(II)/gFe(II)
   was obtained by =Fe(II) in chelated copper sequestration under near
   neutral pH condition (pH 7.70). The mechanism of Cu-II-EDTA
   sequestration by =Fe(II) was concluded as follows:
   3Cu(II)-EDTA+7=Fe(II)+9H(2)O ->
   Cu(0) + Cu2O down arrow (the major product)+2Fe(2)O(3)center dot H2O
   down arrow+3Fe(II)-EDTA+14H(+)
   Novel results strongly indicate that Cu-II reductive transformation
   induced by surface =Fe(II) was mainly responsible for chelated copper
   sequestration. Cu(0) generation was initially facilitated, and
   subsequent reduction of Cu(II) into Cu(I) was closely combined with the
   gradual increase of ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential). Cu-containing
   products were inherently stable, but Cu2O would be reoxidized to Cu(II)
   with extra-aeration, resulting in the release of copper, which was
   beneficial to Cu reclamation. Concentration diminution of Cu-II-EDTA
   within the electric double layer and competitive adsorption were
   responsible for the negative effects of Ca2+, Mg2+. By generating
   vivianite, PO43- was found to decrease surface =Fe(II) content. This
   study is among the first ones to identify the indispensible role of
   reductive decomplexation in chelated copper sequestration. Given the
   high feasibility and reactivity, =Fe(II) may provide a potential
   alternative in chelated metals pollution controlling. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Quantitative point-of-care (POC) devices are the next generation for
   serological disease diagnosis. Whilst pathogen serology is typically
   performed by centralized laboratories using Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent
   Assay (ELISA), faster on-site diagnosis would infer improved disease
   management and treatment decisions. Using the model pathogen Bovine
   Herpes Virus-1 (BHV-1) this study employs an extended-gate field-effect
   transistor (FET) for direct potentiometric serological diagnosis. BHV-1
   is a major viral pathogen of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), the
   leading cause of economic loss (\$2 billion annually in the US only) to
   the cattle and dairy industry. To demonstrate the sensor capabilities as
   a diagnostic tool, BHV-1 viral protein gE was expressed and immobilized
   on the sensor surface to serve as a capture antigen for a BHV-1-specific
   antibody (anti-gE), produced in cattle in response to viral infection.
   The gE-coated immunosensor was shown to be highly sensitive and
   selective to anti-gE present in commercially available anti-BHV-1
   antiserum and in real serum samples from cattle with results being in
   excellent agreement with Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and ELISA. The
   FET sensor is significantly faster than ELISA ( < 10 min), a crucial
   factor for successful disease intervention. This sensor technology is
   versatile, amenable to multiplexing, easily integrated to POC devices,
   and has the potential to impact a wide range of human and animal
   diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of Phonon Surface Scattering on Thermal Energy Distribution of Si
   and SiGe Nanowires}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Thermal transport in nanostructures has attracted considerable attention
   in the last decade but the precise effects of surfaces on heat
   conduction have remained unclear due to a limited accuracy in the
   treatment of phonon surface scattering phenomena. Here, we investigate
   the impact of phonon-surface scattering on the distribution of thermal
   energy across phonon wavelengths and mean free paths in Si and SiGe
   nanowires. We present a rigorous and accurate description of phonon
   scattering at surfaces and predict and analyse nanowire heat spectra for
   different diameters and surface conditions. We show that the decrease in
   the diameter and increased roughness and correlation lengths makes the
   heat phonon spectra significantly shift towards short wavelengths and
   mean free paths. We also investigate the emergence of phonon confinement
   effects for small diameter nanowires and different surface scattering
   properties. Computed results for bulk materials show excellent agreement
   with recent experimentally-based approaches that reconstruct the
   mean-free-path heat spectra. Our phonon surface scattering model allows
   for an accurate theoretical extraction of heat spectra in nanowires and
   contributes to elucidate the development of critical phonon transport
   modes such as phonon confinement and coherent interference effects.}},

Title = {{Benchmarking Density Functional Theory Approaches for the Description of
   Symmetry Breaking in Long Polymethine Dyes}},

Abstract = {{Long polymethines are well-known experimentally to symmetry-break, which
   dramatically modifies their linear and nonlinear optical properties.
   Computational modeling could be very useful to provide insight into the
   symmetry-breaking process, which is not readily available
   experimentally; however, accurately predicting the crossover point from
   symmetric to symmetry-broken structures has proven challenging. Here, we
   benchmark the accuracy of several density functional theory approaches
   relative to CCSD(T) geometries. In particular, we compare analogous
   hybrid and long-range-corrected (LRC) functionals to clearly show the
   influence of the functional exchange term. Although both hybrid and LRC
   functionals can be tuned to reproduce the CCSD(T) geometries, the LRC
   functionals are better performing at reproducing the geometry evolution
   with chain length and provide a finite upper limit for the gas-phase
   crossover point; these methods also provide good agreement with the
   experimental crossover points for more complex polymethines in polar
   solvents. Using an approach based on LRC functionals, a reduction in the
   crossover length is found with increasing medium dielectric constant,
   which is related to localization of the excess charge on the end groups.
   Symmetry breaking is associated with the appearance of an imaginary
   frequency of b(2) symmetry involving a large change in the degree of
   bond-length alternation. Examination of the IR spectra shows that short,
   isolated streptocyanines have a mode at similar to 1200 cm(-1) involving
   a large change in bond-length alternation; as the polymethine length or
   the medium dielectric increases, the frequency of this mode decreases
   before becoming imaginary at the crossover point.}},

   endothelium in vivo}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis occurs preferentially in arterial regions exposed to
   disturbed blood flow. Targeting these pro-atherogenic regions is a
   potential anti-atherogenic therapeutic approach, but it has been
   extremely challenging. Here, using in vivo phage display approach and
   the partial carotid ligation model of flow-induced atherosclerosis in
   mouse, we identified novel peptides that specifically bind to
   endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to disturbed flow condition in
   pro-atherogenic regions. Two peptides, CLIRRTSIC and CPRRSHPIC,
   selectively bound to arterial ECs exposed to disturbed flow not only in
   the partially ligated carotids but also in the lesser curvature and
   branching point of the aortic arch in mice as well as human pulmonary
   artery branches. Peptides were conjugated to branched
   polyethylenimine-polyethylene glycol polymer to generate polyplexes
   carrying siRNA targeting intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (siICAM-1).
   In mouse model, CLIRRTSIC polyplexes carrying si-ICAM-1 specifically
   bound to endothelium in disturbed flow regions, reducing endothelial
   ICAM-1 expression. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that non-muscle
   myosin heavy chain II A (NMHC IIA) is a protein targeted by CLIRRTSIC
   peptide. Further studies showed that shear stress regulates NMHC IIA
   expression and localization in ECs. The CLIRRTSIC is a novel peptide
   that could be used for targeted delivery of therapeutics such as siRNAs
   to pro-atherogenic endothelium.}},

Abstract = {{A thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) equipped for flowing hydrocarbon
   gases allowed in situ deposition of coke on catalyst and support samples
   with excellent coke-catalyst contact, The coke deposition on the
   catalysts and supports, which occurs via a gas phase radical mechanism,
   depends on the reaction time,: temperature, hydrocarbon concentration,
   and sample external surface area but not on the chemical composition of
   the support under the conditions used. The coke samples, including in
   situ generated samples and an industrial coke sample, are characterized
   quantitatively by both deconvolution of Raman spectra, and
   temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analyses. Thermal aging of coke
   is shown to be effective in increasing the hardness of the coke samples.
   Ceria dispersed on cc-alumina, used as a model catalyst for coke
   oxidation, allows coke oxidation at lower temperatures. Using these
   catalysts, coke deposited in situ is shown to oxidize similarly to
   ground (tight contact conditions) Coked catalyst samples, suggesting
   that in situ coke deposition in the TGA can be used to generate samples
   with realistic coke-catalyst contacting, as might be found in an
   industrial reactor or catalyst bed. In situ coking is also observed to
   be reproducible and reliable as compared to loose and tight contact

Abstract = {{Melamine (Mel) is added illegally to foods and feeds due to its high
   nitrogen content and high intake, and it causes serious health problems,
   so it is urgent to build a simple and quick method for detecting Mel in
   our daily life. In this work, a self-powered Mel detection method is
   developed that is based on the newly invented triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) by using the strong electronegativity property of
   Mel. In addition, Mel can enhance the electrical output signals of the
   TENGs by pairing with other triboelectric materials. Thus a
   high-sensitive Mel sensor is designed based on polytetrafl uoethylene
   (PTFE) TENG; the output current of TENG increases with the addition of
   Mel, resulting in largely improved detection limit of Mel with 0.5 ppb
   and a linear increase range from 1 to 500 ppb. This study not only
   develops a new type of material for TENG, but also demonstrates an
   innovative and convenient method for the detection of Mel and other
   biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Counterions with multiple charges have been used to organize
   polymethines into multichromophore salt complexes. The intramolecular
   Coulombic interactions between multiply charged counterions and
   polymethines can play a significant role in modifying intermolecular
   interactions (i.e., aggregation). Here, we report a detailed study of
   the linear and nonlinear optical properties of such complexes with
   dications and hexacations over a large range of molecular
   concentrations. Our results have demonstrated that, despite strong
   intramolecular interactions, the preorganization of chromophores into
   the multichromophore salt constructs with multiple charges can provide a
   steric repulsive effect that can mitigate intermolecular interactions in
   the solid state. This results in a more efficient translation between
   microscopic and macroscopic optical properties for highly polarizable
   polymethines, which is essential for all optical signal switching.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report electrochemical synthesis of Sn oxides with
   dual-pore structure by employing anodic oxidation without the use of a
   porous template. As-prepared Sn oxide layers contain hemispherical
   micropores of less than 2 mm diameters and nanopores of less than 50 nm
   diameters. The formation and size of the micropores strongly depended on
   the thickness of the Sn layer and the type of the underlying substrate.
   A two-step anodic oxidation process produced a completely open pore
   structure, resulting in robust interconnections between the micropores
   and nanopores. The tensile stresses originating from the anodized Sn
   oxide and the associated local distortion of the Sn metal underneath it
   are the likely driving forces for the formation of micropores. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We have synthesized Pd icosahedra with uniform, controllable sizes in
   plug reactors separated by air. The oxygen contained in the air segments
   not only contributed to the generation of a reductant from diethylene
   glycol in situ, but also oxidized elemental Pd back to the ionic form by
   oxidative etching and thus slowed down the reduction kinetics. Compared
   to droplet reactors involving silicone oil or fluorocarbon, the use of
   air as a carrier phase could reduce the production cost by avoiding
   additional procedures for the separation of products from the oil. The
   average diameters of the Pd icosahedra could be readily controlled in
   the range of 12-20 nm. The Pd icosahedra were further employed as seeds
   for the production of Pd@Pt2-3L core-shell icosahedra, which could serve
   as a catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction with greatly enhanced
   activity. We believe that the plug reactors could be extended to other
   types of noble-metal nanocrystals for their scale-up production.}},

Abstract = {{High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and deadliest form
   of ovarian cancer. Yet it is largely asymptomatic in its initial stages.
   Studying the origin and early progression of this disease is thus
   critical in identifying markers for early detection and screening
   purposes. Tissue-based mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be employed
   as an unbiased way of examining localized metabolic changes between
   healthy and cancerous tissue directly, at the onset of disease. In this
   study, we describe MSI results from DicerPten double-knockout (DKO)
   mice, a mouse model faithfully reproducing the clinical nature of human
   HGSC. By using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for the
   unsupervised analysis of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)
   datasets, tissue regions are segregated based on spectral components in
   an unbiased manner, with alterations related to HGSC highlighted.
   Results obtained by combining NMF with DESI-MSI revealed several
   metabolic species elevated in the tumor tissue and/or surrounding
   blood-filled cyst including ceramides, sphingomyelins, bilirubin,
   cholesterol sulfate, and various lysophospholipids. Multiple metabolites
   identified within the imaging study were also detected at altered levels
   within serum in a previous metabolomic study of the same mouse model. As
   an example workflow, features identified in this study were used to
   build an oPLS-DA model capable of discriminating between DKO mice with
   early-stage tumors and controls with up to 88\% accuracy.}},

Title = {{Analytic energy gradients for the coupled-cluster singles and doubles
   method with the density-fitting approximation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{An efficient implementation is presented for analytic gradients of the
   coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method with the
   density-fitting approximation, denoted DF-CCSD. Frozen core terms are
   also included. When applied to a set of alkanes, the DF-CCSD analytic
   gradients are significantly accelerated compared to conventional CCSD
   for larger molecules. The efficiency of our DF-CCSD algorithm arises
   from the acceleration of several different terms, which are designated
   as the ``gradient terms{''}: computation of particle density matrices
   (PDMs), generalized Fock-matrix (GFM), solution of the Z-vector
   equation, formation of the relaxed PDMs and GFM, back-transformation of
   PDMs and GFM to the atomic orbital (AO) basis, and evaluation of
   gradients in the AO basis. For the largest member of the alkane set
   (C10H22), the computational times for the gradient terms (with the
   cc-pVTZ basis set) are 2582.6 (CCSD) and 310.7 (DF-CCSD) min,
   respectively, a speed up of more than 8-folds. For gradient related
   terms, the DF approach avoids the usage of four-index electron repulsion
   integrals. Based on our previous study {[}U. Bozkaya, J. Chem. Phys.
   141, 124108 (2014)], our formalism completely avoids construction or
   storage of the 4-index two-particle density matrix (TPDM), using instead
   2- and 3-index TPDMs. The DF approach introduces negligible errors for
   equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies. Published

Journal = {{NATURE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Realizing the ambitious commitments of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference
   (COP21) will require new ways of meeting human needs previously met by
   burning fossil fuels. Technological developments will be critical, but
   so will accelerated adoption of promising low-emission technologies and
   practices. National commitments will be more achievable if interventions
   take into account key psychological, social, cultural and organizational
   factors that influence energy choices, along with factors of an
   infrastructural, technical and economic nature. Broader engagement of
   social and behavioural science is needed to identify promising
   opportunities for reducing fossil fuel consumption. Here we discuss
   opportunities for change in households and organizations, primarily at
   short and intermediate timescales, and identify opportunities that have
   been underused in much of energy policy. Based on this survey, we
   suggest design principles for interventions by governments and other
   organizations, and identify areas of emphasis for future social science
   and interdisciplinary research.}},

   enhancer activity in early Drosophila embryo}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Enhancers constitute one of the major components of regulatory machinery
   of metazoans. Although several genome-wide studies have focused on
   finding and locating enhancers in the genomes, the fundamental
   principles governing their internal architecture and cis-regulatory
   grammar remain elusive. Here, we describe an extensive, quantitative
   perturbation analysis targeting the dorsal-ventral patterning gene
   regulatory network (GRN) controlled by Drosophila NE-kappa B homolog
   Dorsal. To understand transcription factor interactions on enhancers, we
   employed an ensemble of mathematical models, testing effects of
   cooperativity, repression, and factor potency. Models trained on the
   dataset correctly predict activity of evolutionarily divergent
   regulatory regions, providing insights into spatial relationships
   between repressor and activator binding sites. Importantly, the
   collective predictions of sets of models were effective at novel
   enhancer identification and characterization. Our study demonstrates how
   experimental dataset and modeling can be effectively combined to provide
   quantitative insights into cis-regulatory information on a genome-wide
   scale.}},

Title = {{Identification of side- and shear-dependent microRNAs regulating porcine
   aortic valve pathogenesis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Aortic valve (AV) calcification is an inflammation driven process that
   occurs preferentially in the fibrosa. To explore the underlying
   mechanisms, we investigated if key microRNAs (miRNA) in the AV are
   differentially expressed due to disturbed blood flow (oscillatory shear
   (OS)) experienced by the fibrosa compared to the ventricularis. To
   identify the miRNAs involved, endothelial-enriched RNA was isolated from
   either side of healthy porcine AVs for microarray analysis. Validation
   using qPCR confirmed significantly higher expression of 7 miRNAs
   (miR-100, -130a, -181a/b, -199a-3p, -199a-5p, and -214) in the fibrosa
   versus the ventricularis. Upon bioinformatics analysis, miR-214 was
   selected for further investigation using porcine AV leaflets in an ex
   vivo shear system. Fibrosa and ventricularis sides were exposed to
   either oscillatory or unidirectional pulsatile shear for 2 days and 3 \&
   7 days in regular and osteogenic media, respectively. Higher expression
   of miR-214, increased thickness of the fibrosa, and calcification was
   observed when the fibrosa was exposed to OS compared to the
   ventricularis. Silencing of miR-214 by anti-miR-214 in whole AV leaflets
   with the fibrosa exposed to OS significantly increased the protein
   expression of TGF beta 1 and moderately increased collagen content but
   did not affect AV calcification. Thus, miR-214 is identified as a
   side-and shear-dependent miRNA that regulates key mechanosensitive gene
   in AV such as TGF beta 1.}},

Abstract = {{Pyridine and 3-picoline were prepared from acrolein and ammonia using
   HF/MgZSM-5 as catalyst. The HF/MgZSM-5 catalyst was produced from
   modification of HZSM-5 by HF and Mg(NO3)(2). It was found that the micro
   pore structure of the HZSM-5 carrier would be destroyed when Mg and HF
   were loaded. This corrosion process could be promoted by employing HF
   onto MgZSM-5 carrier comparing with HZSM-5 one, because of the damage of
   MgO to ZSM-5 stability. A micro-mesoporous HZSM-5 zeolite with fewer and
   weaker acid sites was prepared after HF modification. Under the
   optimized conditions, a total yield of 68\% can be reached, with 36\%
   being 3-picoline and 30\% being pyridine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Computing accurate vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) diagrams using Monte
   Carlo simulations is not always straightforward because of the
   difficulty in inserting and deleting molecules. The acceptance
   probability of insertions/deletions is sharply reduced at low
   temperatures and in systems with strong and/or directional interactions,
   like water and ionic liquids. In this work, we highlight the efficiency
   of configurational bias continuous fractional component Monte Carlo
   (CB/CFCMC) for the computation of VLE diagrams of strongly interacting
   systems. We show that CB/CFCMC improves the particle exchange
   probability in the Gibbs ensemble about two times at low temperature and
   about one-third at high temperature compared to CFCMC and about 2 orders
   of magnitude compared to CBMC. The (CB-)CFCMC methods therefore allow
   for routine and efficient computation of VLE diagrams in systems with
   strongly interacting molecules. We demonstrate the successful
   application of the method in the simulation of VLE diagrams of water and
   DMF using the Gibbs ensemble and study the adsorption isotherm of water
   in a DMOF variant using grand-canonical Monte Carlo. Although CFCMC
   methods drastically improve single particle insertion, additional trial
   moves and biasing are needed to study the collective behavior such as
   growth and decay of water clusters. As a downside of the current CFCMC
   methods in the Gibbs ensemble, we note that the use of two fractional
   molecules and the resulting coupling between the gas and the liquid
   phase leads to less than optimal biasing and efficiency.}},

Title = {{Vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural over nickel mixed metal oxide

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{517}},
Pages = {{187-195}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{The hydrogenation of furfural is investigated over various reduced
   nickel mixed metal oxides derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs)
   containing Ni-Mg-Al and Ni-Co-Al. Upon reduction, relatively large Ni(0)
   domains develop in the Ni-Mg-Al catalysts, whereas in the Ni-Co-Al
   catalysts smaller metal particles of Ni(0) and Co(0), potentially as
   alloys, are formed, as evidenced by XAS, XPS, STEM and EELS. All the
   reduced Ni catalysts display similar selectivities towards major
   hydrogenation products (furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl
   alcohol), though the side products varied with the catalyst composition.
   The 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al catalyst showed the greatest activity per titrated
   site when compared to the other catalysts, with promising activity
   compared to related catalysts in the literature. The use of base metal
   catalysts for hydrogenation of furanic compounds may be a promising

Abstract = {{In this study, efficient dechlorination and decomposition of chloroform
   (CF) induced by glow discharge plasma (GDP) in contact with a sodium
   sulfate solution was investigated. Intermediate byproducts were
   determined by ionic chromatography and headspace gas chromatography,
   respectively. Results showed that CF can be effectively dechlorinated
   and decomposed under the action of GDP. Both removal and dechlorination
   of CF increased with increasing pH and with addition of hydroxyl radical
   scavengers to the solution. Addition of H2O2 to the solution slightly
   decreased the CF removal. Formic acid, oxalic acid and dichloromethane
   were determined as the major intermediate byproducts. Final products
   were carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid. Hydrated electrons were the
   most likely active species responsible for initiation of the
   dechlorination, and hydroxyl radicals may be the ones for the oxidation
   of the organic intermediate byproducts. Hydrolyses of the chloromethyl
   radicals contributed much in the mineralization of the organic chlorine.
   Reaction mechanism was proposed based on the dechlorination kinetics and
   the distribution of intermediate byproducts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{AgI sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays (AgI/TiO2-NTs) with adjustable
   beta/gamma ratio of AgI were prepared by a simple
   dissolution-precipitation-calcination process. The samples were
   characterized by various techniques, including X-ray diffraction, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, linear sweep
   voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Mott-Schottky
   plots. We found that calcination temperature (100-500 degrees C) had
   significant effect on regulating the phase of AgI. After calcination at
   350 degrees C, the highest beta/gamma ratio of AgI was achieved.
   Moreover, greatly enhanced photocurrent response and reduced charge
   transfer resistance were also observed, which together led to easier
   generation and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Thus,
   for the reduction of Cr(VI) under visible light, significantly enhanced
   photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance was observed using AgI/TiO2-NTs
   calcined at 350 degrees C (denoted as AgI/TiO2-NTs350) as photoanode and
   Ti foil as cathode, respectively. At very low content of AgI (1.25\%),
   the estimated k(Cr(VI)) (0.0155 min(-1)) was nearly 5 times that of pure
   TiO2-NTs350.}},

Abstract = {{We report a detailed investigation of the factors influencing
   olefin/paraffin separation in the metal organic framework (MOF)
   adsorbent Cu-3(BTC)2 (BTC, benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate). The effects of
   synthesis and activation parameters on the availability of open Cu metal
   sites in the MOP were studied via measurements of crystallinity,
   textural properties, structural defects, and water desorption, as well
   as binary 1-hexene/hexane vapor breakthrough chracteristics. A reduced
   crystallization temperature and improved solvent exchange with methanol
   were found to lead to CuBTC adsorbents with higher olefin selectivity
   and capacity. In situ Fourier transform infrared and mass spectrometry
   measurements were used to quantify the structural defects and
   availability of open metal sites in the MOF as a function of the
   activation conditions. Based upon these measurements) we identify the
   relationships between the defects, activation conditions, open metal
   site availability, and consequent separation performance.
   Recommendations are made for appropriate activation and desorption
   conditions that improve olefin selectivity while maintaining total
   capacity. This investigation led to the identification of a functional
   CuBTC adsorbent with a selectivity of for a 10\%/90\% 1-hexene/hexane
   liquid feed mixture at 50 degrees C, and also suggests a systematic
   methodology to determine Operating conditions for MOF adsorbents with
   open metal sites..}},

Abstract = {{We show hierarchical assembly of plasmonic toroidal metamolecules that
   exhibit tailored optical activity in the visible spectral range. Each
   metamolecule consists of four identical origami-templated helical
   building blocks. Such toroidal metamolecules show a stronger chiroptical
   response than monomers and dimers of the helical building blocks.
   Enantiomers of the plasmonic structures yield opposite circular
   dichroism spectra. Experimental results agree well with the theoretical
   simulations. We also show that given the circular symmetry of the
   structures s distinct chiroptical response along their axial orientation
   can be uncovered via simple spin-coating of the metamolecules on
   substrates. Our work provides a new strategy to create plasmonic chiral
   platforms with sophisticated nanoscale architectures for potential
   applications such as chiral sensing using chemically based assembly
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Postoperative infection and thromboembolism represent significant
   sources of morbidity and mortality but cannot be easily tracked after
   hospital discharge. Therefore, a molecular test that could be performed
   at home would significantly impact disease management. The laboratory
   has previously developed intravenously delivered ``synthetic
   biomarkers{''} that respond to dysregulated proteases to produce a
   urinary signal. These assays, however, have been limited to chronic
   diseases or acute diseases initiated at the time of diagnostic
   administration. Here, a subcutaneously administered sustained-release
   system, using small poly(ethylene glycol) scaffolds (<10 nm) to promote
   diffusion into the bloodstream over a day, is formulated. The utility of
   a thrombin sensor to identify thrombosis and an Matrix metalloproteinase
   (MMP) sensor to measure inflammation is demonstrated. Finally, a
   companion paper ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent sssay), using printed
   wax barriers, with nanomolar sensitivity for urinary reporters for
   point-of-care detection is developed. The approach for subcutaneous
   delivery of nanosensors combined with urinary paper analysis may enable
   facile monitoring of at-risk patients.}},

Title = {{Improving the Accuracy of Daily PM2.5 Distributions Derived from the
   Fusion of Ground-Level Measurements with Aerosol Optical Depth

Abstract = {{The accuracy in estimated fine particulate matter concentrations
   (PM2.5), obtained by fusing of station based measurements and
   satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), is often reduced without
   accounting for the spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 and missing
   AOD observations. In this study, a city-specific linear regression model
   was first developed to fill in missing AOD data. A novel
   interpolation-based variable, PM2.5 spatial interpolator (PMSI2.5), was
   also introduced to account for the spatial dependence in PM2.5 across
   grid cells. A Bayesian hierarchical model was then developed to estimate
   spatiotemporal relationships between AOD and PM2.5. These methods were
   evaluated through a city-specific 10-fold cross-validation procedure in
   a case study in North China in 2014. The cross validation R-2 was 0.61
   when PMSI2.5 was included and 0.48 when PMSI2.5 was excluded. The
   gap-filled AOD values also effectively improved predicted PM2.5
   concentrations with an R-2 = 0.78. Daily ground-level PM2.5
   concentration fields at a 12 km resolution were predicted with complete
   spatial and temporal coverage. This study also indicates that model
   prediction performance should be assessed by accounting for monitor
   clustering due to the potential misinterpretation of model accuracy in
   spatial prediction when validation monitors are randomly selected.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Surface porosity affects the ability of a substance to adsorb gases. The
   surface fractal dimension D is a measure that indicates the amount that
   a surface fills a space, and can thereby be used to characterize the
   surface porosity. Here we propose a new method for determining D, based
   on measuring both the water vapour adsorption isotherm of a given
   substance, and its ability to act as a cloud condensation nucleus when
   introduced to humidified air in aerosol form. We show that our method
   agrees well with previous methods based on measurement of nitrogen
   adsorption. Besides proving the usefulness of the new method for general
   surface characterization of materials, our results show that the surface
   fractal dimension is an important determinant in cloud drop formation on
   water insoluble particles. We suggest that a closure can be obtained
   between experimental critical supersaturation for cloud drop activation
   and that calculated based on water adsorption data, if the latter is
   corrected using the surface fractal dimension of the insoluble cloud
   nucleus.}},

Abstract = {{The extensibility of a linear rapid robust design methodology is

   addition to several potential complexity metrics. Relative to
   traditional robust design methods, the linear rapid robust design
   methodology scaled better with the size of the problem and had
   performance that exceeded the traditional techniques examined. The
   accuracy of applying a method with linear fundamentals to nonlinear
   problems was examined. It is observed that if the magnitude of
   nonlinearity is less than 1000 times that of the nominal linear
   response, the error associated with applying successive linearization
   will result in

Title = {{Interface conductance modal analysis of lattice matched InGaAs/InP}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{We studied the heat conduction at InGaAs/InP interfaces and found that
   the total value of interface conductance was quite high similar to 830
   MW m(-2) K-1. The modal contributions to the thermal interface
   conductance (TIC) were then investigated to determine the mode
   responsible. Using the recently developed interface conductance modal
   analysis method, we showed that more than 70\% of the TIC arises from
   extended modes in the system. The lattice dynamics calculations across
   the interface revealed that, unlike any other interfaces previously
   studied, the different classes of vibration around the interface of
   InGaAs/InP naturally segregate into distinct regions with respect to
   frequency. In addition, interestingly, the entire region of frequency
   overlap between the sides of the interface is occupied by extended
   modes, whereby the two materials vibrate together with a single
   frequency. We also mapped the correlations between modes, which showed
   that the contribution by extended modes to the TIC primarily arises from
   coupling to the modes that have the same frequencies of vibration (i.e.,
   autocorrelations). Moreover, interfacial modes despite their low
   population still contribute more than 6\% to interfacial thermal
   transport. The analysis sheds light on the nature of heat conduction by
   different classes of vibration that exist in interfacial systems, which
   has technological relevance to applications such as thermophotovoltaics
   and optoelectronics. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the piezotronic effect has been observed in two-dimensional
   single-layer MoS2 materials, which have potential applications in force
   and pressure triggered or controlled electronic devices, sensors, and
   human-machine interfaces. However, classical theory faces the difficulty
   in explaining the mechanism of the piezotronic effect for the top-and
   enclosed-contacted MoS2 transistors, since the piezoelectric charges are
   assumed to exist only at the edge of the MoS2 flake that is far from the
   electronic transport pathway. In the present study, we identify the
   piezoelectric charges at the MoS2/metal-MoS2 interface by employing both
   the density functional theory and finite element method simulations.
   This interface is on the transport pathway of both top-and
   enclosed-contacted MoS2 transistors, thus it is capable of controlling
   their transport properties. This study deepens the understanding of
   piezotronic effect and provides guidance for the design of
   two-dimensional piezotronic devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{Sustainable Cities and Society}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, virtual meters or sensors have been rapidly
   developed and widely adopted within a number of different fields
   especially in the building section, and have enabled many intelligent
   features that would otherwise not be possible and economical. Ambient
   wet-bulb temperature is normally measured either by a psychrometer, or a
   combination of dry-bulb temperature sensor and relative humidity sensor.
   These physical sensors are notoriously costly and problematic
   considering their accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, ambient
   wet-bulb temperature is critical in a water-cooled chiller plant to
   enhance its holistic energy efficiency through specific control
   strategies, such as cooling tower temperature relief, condenser water
   supply temperature reset, and so on. This paper introduces a virtual
   ambient wet-bulb sensor through a black-box method using one low-cost
   dry-bulb temperature sensor and local weather data, either typical
   meteorological year (TMY) or real-time weather data. A control algorithm
   for the cooling tower fan operation was also developed to calibrate this
   virtual wet-bulb sensor, thus to minimize its measuring deviation. Two
   case studies in Beijing, China and Texas, USA were adopted to
   demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy under different climate
   scenarios. It shows that the virtual sensor combined with the control
   algorithm has high potential to improve the accuracy of the ambient
   wet-bulb temperature, and guarantee the chiller plant performance by the
   proposed control strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Amine functionalized solid adsorbents are promising materials for the
   capture of CO2 because of their tunability and lower heat capacity
   compared to liquid amine solutions. This review focuses on recent
   advances in the use of solid-supported amines for CO2 capture, with
   emphasis on amine functionalized metal organic framework (MOF)
   materials. The recently reported diamine functionalized Mg-DOBPDC MOF
   demonstrates intriguing performance for CO2 capture, offering a unique
   adsorption mechanism with favorable energetics. Stable performance for
   CO2 capture under humid conditions and easy regenerability of the
   adsorbent are critical to the realization of practical CO2 adsorbents.
   Scalable regeneration methods such as temperature swing in a CO2 purge
   stream and temperature swing via steam stripping are discussed. Emerging
   gas-solid contacting strategies for CO2 capture with amine adsorbents
   are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the vascular wall,
   which preferentially develops in regions under disturbed flow (d-flow).
   Once inflamed, the endothelial cells initiate a signaling cascade that
   culminates in the expression of pro-atherogenic genes such as mRNAs and
   miRNAs. Here we demonstrate that vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
   (VCAM1), which is highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells
   under d-flow, can serve as a marker for the targeted delivery of drug to
   the inflamed endothelium. We could selectively deliver anti-miR-712, an
   inhibitor of a key pro-atherogenic miRNA, to VCAM1-expressing
   immortalized mouse aortic endothelial cells (iMAECs) by hybridizing the
   inhibitor with a carrier DNA that has a complementary sequence and is
   conjugated to the surface of Au nanospheres. Our results suggest that
   the combination of VCAM1-binding peptide and Au nanosphere could provide
   an effective strategy for the selective delivery of anti-athero-miRNAs
   or other drugs into inflamed endothelium for the purpose of inhibiting
   the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the sequencing of
   more and more genomes, propelling related research into the era of big
   data. In this paper, we present ParaBWT, a parallelized Burrows-Wheeler
   transform (BWT) and suffix array construction algorithm for big genome
   data. In ParaBWT, we have investigated a progressive construction
   approach to constructing the BWT of single genome sequences in linear
   space complexity, but with a small constant factor. This approach has
   been further parallelized using multi-threading based on a master-slave
   coprocessing model. After gaining the BWT, the suffix array is
   constructed in a memory-efficient manner. The performance of ParaBWT has
   been evaluated using two sequences generated from two human genome
   assemblies: the Ensembl Homo sapiens assembly and the human reference
   genome. Our performance comparison to FMD-index and Bwt-disk reveals
   that on 12 CPU cores, ParaBWT runs up to 2.2 x faster than FMD-index and
   up to 99.0 x faster than Bwt-disk. BWT construction algorithms for very
   long genomic sequences are time consuming and (due to their incremental
   nature) inherently difficult to parallelize. Thus, their parallelization
   is challenging and even relatively small speedups like the ones of our
   method over FMD-index are of high importance to research. ParaBWT is
   written in C++, and is freely available at
   http://parabwt.sourceforge.net.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new circuit for non-Boolean recognition of binary images.
   Employing all-spin logic (ASL) devices, logic comparators and
   non-Boolean decision blocks for compact and efficient computation are
   designed. By manipulation of fan-in number in different stages of the
   circuit, the structure can be extended for larger training sets or
   larger images. Operating based on the main similarity idea, the system
   is capable of constructing a mean image and compare it with a separate
   input image within a short decision time. Taking advantage of the
   nonvolatility of ASL devices, the proposed circuit is capable of hybrid
   memory/logic operation. Compared with the existing CMOS pattern
   recognition circuits, this paper achieves a smaller footprint, lower
   power consumption, faster decision time, and a lower operational

Abstract = {{A 3D hierarchically porous architecture built from three different
   carbon allotropes (graphene, carbon nanotubes, and chitosan- derived

   functionalized with high heteroatom doping (N: 5.3\% and O: 13.5 \%),
   which has a high specific surface area of 1614 m(2)g(-1). Based on the
   unique characteristics mentioned above, and the positive synergistic
   effects of the allotropes, the nanocomposite exhibits favorable features
   as an electrode for lithium-ion batteries. An outstanding reversible
   specific capacity of 1448 mAhg(-1) is achieved at 100 mAg(-1). Even
   after 200 cycles at 1000 mAg(-1), a high capacity of 749 mAhg(-1) is

Abstract = {{Soil erosion, particularly that caused by agriculture, is closely linked
   to the global carbon (C) cycle. There is a wide range of contrasting
   global estimates of how erosion alters soil-atmosphere C exchange. This
   can be partly attributed to limited understanding of how geomorphology,
   topography, and management practices affect erosion and oxidation of
   soil organic C (SOC). This work presents a physically based approach
   that stresses the heterogeneity at fine spatial scales of SOC erosion,
   SOC burial, and associated soil-atmosphere C fluxes. The Holcombe's
   Branch watershed, part of the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory in South
   Carolina, USA, is the case study used. The site has experienced some of
   the most serious agricultural soil erosion in North America. We use SOC
   content measurements from contrasting soil profiles and estimates of SOC
   oxidation rates at multiple soil depths. The methodology was implemented
   in the tRIBS-ECO (Triangulated Irregular Network-based Real-time
   Integrated Basin Simulator-Erosion and Carbon Oxidation), a spatially
   and depth-explicit model of SOC dynamics built within an existing
   coupled physically based hydro-geomorphic model. According to
   observations from multiple soil profiles, about 32\% of the original SOC
   content has been eroded in the study area. The results indicate that C
   erosion and its replacement exhibit significant topographic variation at
   relatively small scales (tens of meters). The episodic representation of
   SOC erosion reproduces the history of SOC erosion better than models
   that use an assumption of constant erosion in space and time. The net
   atmospheric C exchange at the study site is estimated to range from a
   maximum source of 14.5 gm(-2) yr(-1) to a maximum sink of -18.2 gm(-2)
   yr(-1). The small-scale complexity of C erosion and burial driven by
   topography exerts a strong control on the landscape's capacity to serve
   as a C source or a sink.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless microsystems can add intelligence to hospitals, homes, and
   factories that can save money, energy, and lives. Unfortunately, tiny
   batteries cannot store sufficient energy to sustain useful microsystems
   for long, and replacing or recharging the batteries of hundreds of
   networked nodes is costly and invasive in the case of the human body.
   Thankfully, shocks and vibrations are prevalent in many applications, so
   ambient kinetic energy can continually replenish batteries to extend the
   life of the systems they support. And since tiny devices produce minimal
   damping effects on motion, they can draw as much power as the
   microelectronics allow. Unfortunately, uncollected charge, breakdown
   voltages, and energy losses limit how much power harvesting microsystems
   can generate. This is why this paper reviews how tiny transducers
   generate power and how state-of-the-art diode bridges and switched
   inductors and their derivatives draw and output as much power as
   possible. Of prevailing technologies, in fact, the recycling bridge
   pre-damps the transducer at the highest voltage possible all the time to
   output the highest power. But because it still needs a regulating
   charger to stay at its maximum power point, other pre-damping switched
   inductors suffer lower losses and require less space. Although the
   pre-damping bridgeless solution pre-damps every other half cycle, it
   generates comparable power with only two switches. No harvester,
   however, escapes the limits that power losses and breakdown voltages
   impose, so output power is always finite, and in the case of
   miniaturized systems, not very high.}},

   Systems}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The inherent complexity of biological systems gives rise to complicated
   mechanistic models with a large number of parameters. On the other hand,
   the collective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a
   relatively small number of phenomenological parameters. We use the
   Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving
   simple phenomenological models from complicated mechanistic models. The
   resulting models are not black boxes, but remain expressed in terms of
   the microscopic parameters. In this way, we explicitly connect the
   macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, characterize the equivalence
   class of distinct systems exhibiting the same range of collective
   behavior, and identify the combinations of components that function as
   tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the procedure for
   adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48 parameter
   mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a single
   adaptation parameter tau characterizing the ratio of time scales for the
   initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be
   expressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates,
   Michaelis-Menten constants, and biochemical concentrations. The
   situation is not unlike modeling in physics in which microscopically
   complex processes can often be renormalized into simple phenomenological
   models with only a few effective parameters. The proposed method
   additionally provides a mechanistic explanation for non-universal
   features of the behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Nanonetworks consist of nano-sized communicating devices which are able
   to perform simple tasks at the nanoscale. The limited capabilities of
   individual nanomachines and the Terahertz (THz) band channel behavior
   lead to error-prone wireless links. In this paper, a cross-layer
   analysis of error-control strategies for nanonetworks in the THz band is
   presented. A mathematical framework is developed and used to analyze the
   tradeoffs between Bit Error Rate, Packet Error Rate, energy consumption
   and latency, for five different error-control strategies, namely,
   Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), Forward Error Correction (FEC), two
   types of Error Prevention Codes (EPC) and a hybrid EPC. The cross-layer
   effects between the physical and the link layers as well as the impact
   of the nanomachine capabilities in both layers are taken into account.
   At the physical layer, nanomachines are considered to communicate by
   following a time-spread on-off keying modulation based on the
   transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. At the link layer, nanomachines
   are considered to access the channel in an uncoordinated fashion, by
   leveraging the possibility to interleave pulse-based transmissions from
   different nodes. Throughout the analysis, accurate path loss, noise and
   multi-user interference models, validated by means of electromagnetic
   simulation, are utilized. In addition, the energy consumption and
   latency introduced by a hardware implementation of each error control
   technique, as well as, the additional constraints imposed by the use of
   energy-harvesting mechanisms to power the nanomachines, are taken into
   account. The results show that, despite their simplicity, EPCs
   outperform traditional ARQ and FEC schemes, in terms of error correcting
   capabilities, which results in further energy savings and reduced
   latency.}},

Title = {{Noise suppression for dual-energy CT via penalized weighted least-square
   optimization with similarity-based regularization}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Dual-energy CT (DECT) expands applications of CT imaging in its
   capability to decompose CT images into material images. However,
   decomposition via direct matrix inversion leads to large noise
   amplification and limits quantitative use of DECT. Their group has
   previously developed a noise suppression algorithm via penalized
   weighted least-square optimization with edge-preservation regularization
   (PWLS-EPR). In this paper, the authors improve method performance using
   the same framework of penalized weighted least-square optimization but
   with similarity-based regularization (PWLS-SBR), which substantially
   enhances the quality of decomposed images by retaining a more uniform
   noise power spectrum (NPS).
   Methods: The design of PWLS-SBR is based on the fact that averaging
   pixels of similar materials gives a low-noise image. For each pixel, the
   authors calculate the similarity to other pixels in its neighborhood by
   comparing CT values. Using an empirical Gaussian model, the authors
   assign high/low similarity value to one neighboring pixel if its CT
   value is close/far to the CT value of the pixel of interest. These
   similarity values are organized in matrix form, such that multiplication
   of the similarity matrix to the image vector reduces image noise. The
   similarity matrices are calculated on both high- and low-energy CT
   images and averaged. In PWLS-SBR, the authors include a regularization
   term to minimize the L-2 norm of the difference between the images
   without and with noise suppression via similarity matrix multiplication.
   By using all pixel information of the initial CT images rather than just
   those lying on or near edges, PWLS-SBR is superior to the previously
   developed PWLS-EPR, as supported by comparison studies on phantoms and a
   head-and-neck patient.
   Results: On the line-pair slice of the Catphan (c) 600 phantom, PWLS-SBR
   outperforms PWLS-EPR and retains spatial resolution of 8 lp/cm,
   comparable to the original CT images, even at 90\% reduction in noise
   standard deviation (STD). Similar performance on spatial resolution is
   observed on an anthropomorphic head phantom. In addition, results of
   PWLS-SBR show substantially improved image quality due to preservation
   of image NPS. On the Catphan (c) 600 phantom, NPS using PWLS-SBR has a
   correlation of 93\% with that via direct matrix inversion, while the
   correlation drops to -52\% for PWLS-EPR. Electron density measurement
   studies indicate high accuracy of PWLS-SBR. On seven different
   materials, the measured electron densities calculated from the
   decomposed material images using PWLS-SBR have a root-mean-square error
   (RMSE) of 1.20\%, while the results of PWLS-EPR have a RMSE of 2.21\%.
   In the study on a head-and-neck patient, PWLS-SBR is shown to reduce
   noise STD by a factor of 3 on material images with image qualities
   comparable to CT images, whereas fine structures are lost in the
   PWLS-EPR result. Additionally, PWLS-SBR better preserves low contrast on
   the tissue image.
   Conclusions: The authors propose improvements to the regularization term
   of an optimization framework which performs iterative image-domain
   decomposition for DECT with noise suppression. The regularization term
   avoids calculation of image gradient and is based on pixel similarity.
   The proposed method not only achieves a high decomposition accuracy, but
   also improves over the previous algorithm on NPS as well as spatial
   resolution. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic offloading and resource sharing are two common methods for
   delivering cellular data traffic over unlicensed bands. In this paper,
   we first develop a hybrid method to take full advantages of both traffic
   offloading and resource sharing methods, where cellular base stations
   (BSs) offload traffic to WiFi networks and simultaneously occupy certain
   number of time slots on unlicensed bands. Then, we analytically compare
   the cellular throughput of the three methods with the guarantee of WiFi
   per-user throughput in the single-BS scenario. We find that traffic
   offloading can achieve better performance than resource sharing when
   existing WiFi user number is below a threshold and the hybrid method
   achieves the same performance as the resource sharing method when
   existing WiFi user number is large enough. In the multi-BS scenario
   where the coverage of small cells and WiFi access points are mutually
   overlapped, we consider to maximize the minimum average per-user
   throughput of each small cell and derive a closed-form expression for
   the throughput upper bound in each method. Meanwhile, practical traffic
   offloading and resource sharing algorithms are also developed for the
   three methods, respectively. Numerical results validate our theoretical
   analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms as

Abstract = {{The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithm has been adopted as a lattice
   reduction (LR) technique for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   communications to improve performance with low complexity. However,
   implementing the LLL algorithm is still challenging due to slow
   convergence especially for large channel matrices. One of the main
   reasons is that the column swap may not happen in some LLL iterations,
   which leads to more iterations. To address it, some greedy LLL
   algorithms have recently been proposed, which only perform the
   iterations with column swaps. In this paper, we propose two efficient
   greedy LLL algorithms for various LR-aided MIMO detectors. First, both
   algorithms use a relaxed Lovasz condition to search the candidate set of
   LLL iterations. Then, to select an LLL iteration in the candidate set
   each time, one is based on a relaxed decrescence of LLL potential, and
   the other takes the error performance of the LR-aided MIMO detectors
   into consideration. The proposed two algorithms are proved to collect
   full receive diversity in both LR-aided linear and
   successive-interference-cancellation detectors. Furthermore, compared to
   existing greedy LLL algorithms, simulations show that the proposed two
   algorithms not only converge faster but also exhibit much lower
   complexity while maintaining comparable error performance in LR-aided
   MIMO detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Hinokitiol is a tropolone-related compound found in heartwood
   cupressaceous plants. Hinokitiol slows the growth of a variety of
   cancers through inhibition of cell proliferation. The low water
   solubility of hinokitiol leads to less bioavailability. This has been
   highlighted as a major limiting factor. In this study, mesoporous
   calcium silicate (MCS) nanoparticles, both pure and hinokitiol-loaded,
   were synthesized and their effects on A549 cells were analyzed. The
   results indicate that Hino-MCS nanoparticles induce apoptosis in higher
   concentration loads (>12.5 mu g/mL) for A549 cells. Hino-MCS
   nanoparticles suppress gene and protein expression levels of multiple
   drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). In addition, both the activity and the
   expression levels of caspase-3/-9 were measured in Hino-MCS
   nanoparticle-treated A549 cells. The Hino-MCS nanoparticles-triggered
   apoptosis was blocked by inhibitors of pan-caspase, caspase-3/-9, and
   antioxidant agents (N-acetylcysteine; NAC). The Hino-MCS nanoparticles
   enhance reactive oxygen species production and the protein expression
   levels of caspase-3/-9. Our data suggest that Hino-MCS nanoparticles
   trigger an intrinsic apoptotic pathway through regulating the function
   of MDR1 and the production of reactive oxygen species in A549 cells.
   Therefore, we believe that Hino-MCS nanoparticles may be efficacious in
   the treatment of drug-resistant human lung cancer in the future.}},

Title = {{Effects of Peripapillary Scleral Stiffening on the Deformation of the
   Lamina Cribrosa}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Scleral stiffening has been proposed as a treatment for
   glaucoma to protect the lamina cribrosa (LC) from excessive intraocular
   pressure-induced deformation. Here we experimentally evaluated the
   effects of moderate stiffening of the peripapillary sclera on the
   deformation of the LC.
   METHODS. An annular sponge, saturated with 1.25\% glutaraldehyde, was
   applied to the external surface of the peripapillary sclera for 5
   minutes to stiffen the sclera. Tissue deformation was quantified in two
   groups of porcine eyes, using digital image correlation (DIC) or
   computed tomography imaging and digital volume correlation (DVC). In
   group A (n = 14), eyes were subjected to inflation testing before and
   after scleral stiffening. Digital image correlation was used to measure
   scleral deformation and quantify the magnitude of scleral stiffening. In
   group B (n = 5), the optic nerve head region was imaged using
   synchrotron radiation phase-contrast microcomputed tomography (PC mu CT)
   at an isotropic spatial resolution of 3.2 mu m. Digital volume
   correlation was used to compute the full-field three-dimensional
   deformation within the LC and evaluate the effects of peripapillary
   scleral cross-linking on LC biomechanics.
   RESULTS. On average, scleral treatment with glutaraldehyde caused a 34
   +/- 14\% stiffening of the peripapillary sclera measured at 17 mm Hg and
   a 47 +/- 12\% decrease in the maximum tensile strain in the LC measured
   at 15 mm Hg. The reduction in LC strains was not due to cross-linking of
   the LC.
   CONCLUSIONS. Peripapillary scleral stiffening is effective at reducing
   the magnitude of biomechanical strains within the LC. Its potential and
   future utilization in glaucoma axonal neuroprotection requires further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Micro air vehicles promise to play an important part in public, private,
   and military arenas in the coming years. Small, lightweight, agile, and
   inexpensive, these flying machines are of interest in domestic
   search-and-rescue operations, law enforcement, reconnaissance, mapping,
   and urban combat operations. Nature demonstrates that flapping wings are
   an extremely effective solution to the problem of hovering flight with
   good agility in close quarters. However, the highly unsteady, largely
   separated character of the flow complicates aerodynamic analysis of
   these vehicles, and these challenges are magnified in a design setting
   when the sensitivities to many geometric and kinematic parameters must
   be assessed. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation is
   applied as a means to evaluate kinematic parameters of flapping wings
   for a four-wing, dragonfly-likemicro air vehicle. It is shown that
   high-frequency, moderate-amplitude flapping is preferred for wings
   flapping in a vertical stroke plane, and increasing the feathering
   rotation angle also has a positive effect on performance. Comparisons
   have been made with horizontal-stroke-plane hovering, identifying
   potential benefits of this configuration, and interactions between wings
   are also evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical trajectory optimization for the en route descent phase is
   studied in the presence of both along-track and cross winds, which are
   both modeled as functions of altitude. The flight range covers some
   portion of a cruise segment and ends at a meter fix. The descent
   trajectory is assumed as a flight idle descent. The problem is
   formulated as an optimal control problem with both mixed state path
   constraints and pure state constraints. For minimizing environmental
   impacts, we optimize descent trajectory with respect to two cost
   functionals: fuel and emissions costs. We analyze both singular arc and
   boundary arc using the necessary conditions of the optimality. From the
   analysis result, we propose the optimal trajectory generation method, in
   which the optimal trajectory is generated by the backward and forward
   integration. The trajectory from the proposed algorithm is compared with
   the numerical optimal solution of the original optimal control problem.
   The result shows that the proposed algorithm generates the same solution
   as the numerical optimal solution. The wind speed, windshear, and
   cross-wind effects on the optimal trajectory are analyzed with two
   aircraft type, Boeing 737-500 and Boeing 767-400.}},

   electron-blocking layer (Q-EBL) on hole transport and distribution in
   InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) of visible light-emitting diodes
   (LEDs). Triple-wavelength (TW)-emitting active region was introduced to
   deduce carrier transport and distribution from emission intensities of
   different QWs in TW-LEDs. The electro-optical characteristics of TW-LEDs
   were compared with respect to the Q-EBL and silicon doping in a
   selectedQWbarrier. In addition, the efficiency droop characteristics of
   TW-LEDs according to existence of the Q-EBL were also investigated. The
   results show that holes were preferentially injected into a QW adjacent
   to a p-type layer in the TW-LED without the Q-EBL, while enhanced hole
   transport to lower QWs closed to an n-type layer and following uniform
   distribution were observed in the TW-LED with the Q-EBL. The modified
   kinetic energy of holes overcoming the Q-EBL is responsible for the
   improved hole transport and changes in the carrier capturing efficiency
   of each different QW, resulting in the improved peak efficiency and the
   efficiency droop of TW-LEDs. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Title = {{Measuring Micro-Friction Torque in MEMS Gas Bearings}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An in situ measurement of micro-friction torque in MEMS gas bearings,
   which has been a challenging research topic for years, is realized by a
   system designed in this paper. In the system, a high accuracy
   micro-force sensor and an electronically-driven table are designed,
   fabricated and utilized. With appropriate installation of the sensor and
   bearings on the table, the engine rotor can be driven to rotate with the
   sensor using a silicon lever beam. One end of the beam is fixed to the
   shaft of the gas bearing, while the other end is free and in contact
   with the sensor probe tip. When the sensor begins to rotate with the
   table, the beam is pushed by the sensor probe to rotate in the same
   direction. For the beam, the friction torque from the gas bearing is
   balanced by the torque induced by pushing force from the sensor probe.
   Thus, the friction torque can be calculated as a product of the pushing
   force measured by the sensor and the lever arm, which is defined as the
   distance from the sensor probe tip to the centerline of the bearing.
   Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this system, with a
   sensitivity of 1.285 mV/mu N . m in a range of 0 to 11.76 mu N . m when
   the lever arm is 20 mm long. The measuring range can be modified by
   varying the length of the lever arm. Thus, this system has wide
   potential applications in measuring the micro-friction torque of gas
   bearings in rotating MEMS machines.}},

   Dielectric Property for Flexible Electronics}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Flexible substrates that host electronic components are an essential
   part of flexible electronics. The continuing miniaturization of these
   electronics requires flexible substrates with excellent flexibility,
   high thermal conductivity, and low dielectric constant. However, to
   combine these intended properties remains a daunting challenge. Here, a
   flexible fibrous epoxy substrate fabricated by an electrospinning
   technique is reported, which exhibits excellent flexibility, high
   thermal conductivity, and low dielectric constant. The thermal
   conductivity can be tuned by varying the diameter of fibers and can
   reach values as high as 0.8 W m(-1) K-1 , which is about three times
   higher than that of casted epoxy substrate fabricated by spin-coating.
   This excellent performance is attributed to polymer molecular chain
   alignment and fibrous structure that are formed during electrospinning.
   Demonstrative applications suggests its broad potential uses in future
   flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion absorption refrigeration (DAR) cycle offers a potentially
   fully thermally activated cooling technology. However, most
   implementations operate with high source temperatures, forced liquid
   cooling, or elevated evaporator temperatures ( greater than or similar
   to 5 degrees C). Additionally, few component design resources are
   available in the literature. In Part I of this investigation, a fully
   passive DAR design is proposed. Reduced temperature operation is enabled
   with alternate working fluids (NH3-NaSCN-He), a distributed heated
   bubble-pump generator (BPG), and an enhanced absorber. Detailed models
   are formulated for the BPG, condenser, evaporator, absorber, and gas
   circulation loop. These are integrated to yield an overall system model.
   System behavior is evaluated over a range of operating conditions. With
   the necessary and reasonably expected component performances,
   refrigeration COPs of 0.11-0.26 can be achieved at design conditions
   (T-amb = 24 degrees C) with low source temperatures (110-130 degrees C)
   and passive air cooling. In the accompanying paper (Part II), this
   refrigeration system is experimentally demonstrated, and the proposed
   models are evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights

Pages = {{3009-3020}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This work introduces a formalism for computing external acoustic
   scattering from phononic crystals (PCs) with arbitrary exterior shape
   using a Bloch wave expansion technique coupled with the
   Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral (HKI). Similar to a Kirchhoff
   approximation, a geometrically complex PC's surface is broken into a set
   of facets in which the scattering from each facet is calculated as if it
   was a semi-infinite plane interface in the short wavelength limit. When
   excited by incident radiation, these facets introduce wave modes into
   the interior of the PC. Incorporation of these modes in the HKI, summed
   over all facets, then determines the externally scattered acoustic
   field. In particular, for frequencies in a complete bandgap (the usual
   operating frequency regime of many PC-based devices and the requisite
   operating regime of the presented theory), no need exists to solve for
   internal reflections from oppositely facing edges and, thus, the total
   scattered field can be computed without the need to consider internal
   multiple scattering. Several numerical examples are provided to verify
   the presented approach. Both harmonic and transient results are
   considered for spherical and bean-shaped PCs, each containing over 100
   000 inclusions. This facet formalism is validated by comparison to an
   existing self-consistent scattering technique. (C) 2016 Acoustical

Abstract = {{We study a dynamic game in which short-run players repeatedly play a
   symmetric, strictly supermodular game whose payoffs depend on a fixed
   unknown state of nature. Each short-run player inherits the beliefs of
   his immediate predecessor in addition to observing the actions of the
   players in his social neighborhood in the previous stage. Because of the
   strategic complementary between their actions, players have the
   incentive to coordinate with others and learn from them. We show that in
   any Markov Bayesian equilibrium of the game, players eventually reach
   consensus in their actions. They also asymptotically receive similar
   payoffs despite initial differences in their access to information. We
   further show that, if the players' payoffs can be represented by a
   quadratic function, then the private observations are optimally
   aggregated in the limit for generic specifications of the game.
   Therefore, players asymptotically coordinate on choosing the best action
   given the aggregate information available throughout the network. We
   provide extensions of our results to the case of changing networks and
   endogenous private signals.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrometer test is one of the most reliable approaches to estimate
   the particle size distribution of fine-grained soil. The general
   approach neglects the particle hydrodynamic interactions which are known
   to hinder the settling rate of particles, and, as such, generally leads
   to an underestimation of the particle diameters. In this study, a
   theoretical hydrodynamic correction of the hydrometer test is proposed
   to account for the hindered velocity of particles settling through a
   suspension of monomodal spherical or non-spherical particles. The
   polydisperse nature of soil samples is then taken into consideration by
   introducing an effective volume fraction of particles for each partially
   sorted monomodal layer of particles. Using this approach, a model to
   correct for particle hydrodynamic interactions in conventional
   hydrometer tests is provided and tested successfully against results
   from laser diffraction measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A central assertion in the study of neural processing is that our
   perception of the environment directly reflects the activity of our
   sensory neurons. This assertion reinforces the intuition that the
   strength of a sensory input directly modulates the amount of neural
   activity observed in response to that sensory feature: an increase in
   the strength of the input yields a graded increase in the amount of
   neural activity. However, cortical activity across a range of sensory
   pathways can be sparse, with individual neurons having remarkably low
   firing rates, often exhibiting suprathreshold activity on only a
   fraction of experimental trials. To compensate for this observed
   apparent unreliability, it is assumed that instead the local population
   of neurons, although not explicitly measured, does reliably represent
   the strength of the sensory input. This assumption, however, is largely
   untested. In this study, using wide-field voltage-sensitive dye (VSD)
   imaging of the somatosensory cortex in the anesthetized rat, we show
   that whisker deflection velocity, or stimulus strength, is not encoded
   by the magnitude of the population response at the level of cortex.
   Instead, modulation of whisker deflection velocity affects the
   likelihood of the cortical response, impacting the magnitude, rate of
   change, and spatial extent of the cortical response. An ideal observer
   analysis of the cortical response points to a probabilistic code based
   on repeated sampling across cortical columns and/or time, which we refer
   to as the probability of activation hypothesis. This hypothesis
   motivates a range of testable predictions for both future
   electrophysiological and future behavioral studies.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of onorbit debris has motivated much of the recent
   space situational awareness missions and related research. Space-based
   missions are typically carried out by large spacecraft, yet the emerging
   and improving technology for CubeSat-class satellites offers a potential

   defines space object detectability for a given electrooptical sensor and
   applies an optimization problem approach to mission design for a CubeSat
   space situational awareness constellation. The optimization of the
   design parameters for this constellation is separated into a formal
   description of the concept of operations, an optimization of the
   electrooptical sensor payload itself, and an optimization of the
   constellation parameters via the number of satellites and traditional
   orbital parameters. A Pareto frontier of mission design points in terms
   of object detection capability and lifecycle cost is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Risk management plans improve the likelihood of mission success by
   identifying potential failures early and planning mitigation methods to
   circumvent any issues. However, in the aerospace industry to date, risk
   management plans have typically only been used for larger and more
   expensive satellites and have rarely been applied to lower-cost
   satellites such as CubeSats. Furthermore, existing risk management plans
   typically require experienced personnel and significant time to perform
   the analysis. The CubeSat Decision Advisor tool uses components of
   decision theory such as decision trees, multi-attribute utility theory,
   and utility elicitation methods to determine the expected utilities of
   proposed mitigation techniques to a mission risk. Based on the user's
   value preference system, assessment of success probabilities, and
   resources required for a given mitigation technique, the tool suggests
   the course of action that will normatively yield the most value for the
   COST, people, and time resources required. This research creates a risk
   management software tool never before available that is easily
   accessible and usable for low-cost small satellite missions due to its
   construction in Microsoft Excel. A demonstration analysis is conducted
   on a university CubeSat mission as a case study. The target audience for
   this tool is primarily university labs, which could not otherwise afford
   expensive software packages. However, the tool is broadly applicable to
   all organizations, including government, academic, and corporate, and is
   not constrained to university small satellite mission architectures.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the maturation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived
   cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) will facilitate their applications in disease
   modeling and drug discovery. Previous studies suggest that cell
   alignment could enhance hPSC-CM maturation; however, the robustness of
   this approach has not been well investigated. To this end, we examined
   if the anisotropic orientation of hPSC-CMs imposed by the underlying
   aligned fibers within a 3D microenvironment could improve the maturation
   of hPSC-CMs. Enriched hPSC-CMs were cultured for two weeks on
   Matrigel-coated anisotropic (aligned) and isotropic (random)
   polycaprolactone (PCL) fibrous scaffolds, as well as tissue culture
   polystyrenes (TCPs) as a control. As expected, hPSC-CMs grown on the two
   types of fibrous scaffolds exhibited anisotropic and isotropic
   orientations, respectively. Similar to cells on TCPs, hPSC-CMs cultured
   on these scaffolds expressed CM-associated proteins and were
   pharmacologically responsive to adrenergic receptor agonists, a
   muscarinic agonist, and a gap junction uncoupler in a dose-dependent
   manner. Although hPSC-CMs grown on anisotropic fibrous scaffolds
   displayed the highest expression of genes encoding a number of sarcomere
   proteins, calcium handling proteins and ion channels, their calcium
   transient kinetics were slower than cells grown on TCPs. These results
   suggest that electrospun anisotropic fibrous scaffolds, as a single
   method, have limited effect on improving the maturation of hPSC-CMs. (C)

Abstract = {{The potential environmental impacts of engineered cerium oxide
   nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) on aquatic organisms have remained largely
   unknown. Therefore, the laboratory study featured herein was performed
   to determine the fate of CeO2 NPs in an aquatic environment and their
   toxicity towards 14 different ciliated protist species at a specified
   population level. An investigation of 48 h aggregation kinetics in the
   Dryl's solution showed the CeO2 NPs to be relatively stable. The pH
   values in three test medium were too far away from PZC, which explained
   the stability of CeO2 NPs. CeO2 NPs generally elicited more toxicity
   with increasing NP concentration, following certain dose-response
   relationships. Nano-CeO2 resulted in greater toxicity in a particle
   state than when added as bulk material. LC50 values showed a negative
   correlation with the surface-to-volume ratio for these protists,
   suggesting that surface adsorption of CeO2 NPs might contribute to the
   observed toxicity. Additionally, acute toxic responses of 14 ciliated
   protist species to CeO2 NPs were not significantly phylogenetically
   conserved. The results of these observations provide a better insight
   into the potential risks of CeO2 NPs in an aquatic environment. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Monocytes and macrophages play a critical role in tissue development,
   homeostasis, and injury repair. These innate immune cells participate in
   guiding vascular remodeling, stimulation of local stem and progenitor
   cells, and structural repair of tissues such as muscle and bone.
   Therefore, there is a great interest in harnessing this powerful
   endogenous cell source for therapeutic regeneration through
   immunoregenerative biomaterial engineering. These materials seek to
   harness specific subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages to promote
   repair by influencing their recruitment, positioning, differentiation,
   and function within a damaged tissue. Monocyte and macrophage phenotypes
   span a continuum of inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory or
   pro-regenerative cells (M2), and their heterogeneous functions are
   highly dependent on microenvironmental cues within the injury niche.
   Increasing evidence suggests that division of labor among subpopulations
   of monocytes and macrophages could allow for harnessing regenerative
   functions over inflammatory functions of myeloid cells; however, the
   complex balance between necessary functions of inflammatory versus
   regenerative myeloid cells remains to be fully elucidated. Historically,
   biomaterial-based therapies for promoting tissue regeneration were
   designed to minimize the host inflammatory response; although, recent
   appreciation for the roles that innate immune cells play in tissue
   repair and material integration has shifted this paradigm. A number of
   opportunities exist to exploit known signaling systems of specific
   populations of monocytes/macrophages to promote repair and to better
   understand the biological and pathological roles of myeloid cells. This
   review seeks to outline the characteristics of distinct populations of
   monocytes and macrophages, identify the role of these cells within
   diverse tissue injury niches, and offer design criteria for
   immunoregenerative biomaterials given the intrinsic inflammatory
   response to their implantation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a wideband scalable circuit model for tapered
   through-package vias (TPVs) in glass interposers. By slicing TPVs
   horizontally into infinitesimally thin pieces and integrating along
   TPVs, an analytical solution was derived for the parasitic resistance
   (R), while semianalytical expressions were derived for the parasitic
   inductance (L), capacitance (C), and conductance (G) in the proposed
   model. Then, this model was verified against a 3-D electromagnetic
   solver in terms of S-parameters for various TPV dimensions, with the
   differences of S-21 magnitude and S21 phases being less than 0.01 dB and
   1 degrees, respectively. In addition, two dual-via chains of different
   lengths were designed, fabricated, and measured to benchmark the
   proposed model up to 20 GHz. The excellent consistency between them
   further proves the validity of the proposed model. Finally, the effect
   of the TPV taper was comprehensively studied on the RLCG parameters. It
   was found that the TPV taper was beneficial to reduce the parasitic
   capacitance and conductance by as much as 40\%. Despite these benefits,
   tapered TPVs are not preferred, because the parasitic resistance and
   inductance are the dominant factors for TPVs in glass, and the TPV taper
   increases the parasitic resistance drastically and also increases the
   parasitic inductance by as much as 80\%.}},

Title = {{A task scheduling algorithm based on supercapacitor charge
   redistribution and energy harvesting for wireless sensor nodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{186-194}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a task scheduling problem for wireless sensor nodes
   that harvest energy from the ambient environment and use supercapacitors
   to store the scavenged energy. Power management for supercapacitor-based
   wireless sensor nodes usually takes into account the supercapacitor
   self-discharge characteristic. Recently, another supercapacitor
   characteristic called charge redistribution has also been investigated.
   This paper considers a task scheduling problem, which is a fundamental
   power management problem in wireless sensor networks, and develops a
   modified earliest deadline first (MEDF) algorithm based on
   supercapacitor charge redistribution and energy harvesting. The MEDF
   algorithm modifies the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm by taking
   into account the energy constraints of tasks in addition to their timing
   constraints. The MEDF algorithm is developed and implemented based on a
   model used to analyze the power flow in wireless sensor nodes. Two
   metrics are defined to evaluate the MEDF algorithm performance: deadline
   miss rate for timing performance and energy violation rate for energy
   performance. The MEDF algorithm is evaluated using both experiments and
   simulations. Measurement and simulation results show that the MEDF
   algorithm improves the energy performance of the EDF algorithm while
   maintaining its timing performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Heat transfer during condensation of refrigerant blends R404A and R410A
   flowing through horizontal tubes with 0.76 <= D <= 9.4mm at nominal P-r

   measured for the mass flux range 200 < G < 800 kg m(-2) s(-1) in small
   quality increments over the entire vapor-liquid region. Heat transfer
   coefficients increased with quality and mass flux, while the effect of
   reduced pressure was not very significant within this range of
   pressures. The heat transfer coefficients increased with a decrease in
   diameter. Correlations from the literature were not able to predict the
   condensation heat transfer coefficient for these fluids at these
   near-critical pressures over the wide range of tube diameters under
   consideration. A new flow-regime based model for heat transfer in the
   wavy, annular, and annular/wavy transition regimes, which predicts 91\%

   Networks}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEM SECURITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{When people utilize social applications and services, their privacy
   suffers a potential serious threat. In this article, we present a novel,
   robust, and effective de-anonymization attack to mobility trace data and
   social data. First, we design a Unified Similarity (US) measurement,
   which takes account of local and global structural characteristics of
   data, information obtained from auxiliary data, and knowledge inherited
   from ongoing de-anonymization results. By analyzing the measurement on
   real datasets, we find that some data can potentially be de-anonymized
   accurately and the other can be de-anonymized in a coarse granularity.
   Utilizing this property, we present a US-based De-Anonymization (DA)
   framework, which iteratively de-anonymizes data with accuracy guarantee.
   Then, to de-anonymize large-scale data without knowledge of the overlap
   size between the anonymized data and the auxiliary data, we generalize
   DA to an Adaptive De-Anonymization (ADA) framework. By smartly working
   on two core matching subgraphs, ADA achieves high de-anonymization
   accuracy and reduces computational overhead. Finally, we examine the
   presented de-anonymization attack on three well-known mobility traces:
   St Andrews, Infocom06, and Smallblue, and three social datasets:
   ArnetMiner, Google+, and Facebook. The experimental results demonstrate
   that the presented de-anonymization framework is very effective and
   robust to noise.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered conductive scaffolds toward neural regeneration should have
   the ability to regulate mesenchymal stems cell (MSC) differentiation
   into neural lineage through an electrical stimulation-assisted culture
   process. In this work, a self-powered electrical stimulation-assisted
   neural differentiation system for MSCs was realized by combining a high
   effective triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to supply pulsed electric
   simulation signals and a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
   (PEDOT)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid microfiber (80 mu m in
   diameter) as a scaffold. The conductive PEDOT endows the rGO PEDOT
   hybrid microfiber with an enhanced electrical conductivity and maintains
   a good cytocompatibility. MSCs cultured on this highly conductive rGO
   PEDOT hybrid microfiber possess enhanced proliferation ability and good
   neural differentiation tendency. Importantly, by inducing electric
   pulses generated by the TENG as the electrical stimulation signal, which
   are triggered by human walking steps, neural differentiation of MSCs is
   dramatically improved. This study illustrates the customizability of the
   rGO PEDOT hybrid microfiber for neural tissue engineering scaffolding
   applications, underlines the potential of a self-powered TENG electrical
   stimulation system for accelerating MSC differentiation into neural
   cells without bio/chemical cues, and suggests the TENG's practical use
   as a wearable stimulation system to assist nerve regeneration for a
   walking person.}},

Abstract = {{With enhancements in the performance of optoelectronic devices, the
   field of piezo-phototronics has attracted much attention, and several
   theoretical works have been reported based on semiclassical models. At
   present, the feature size of optoelectronic devices are rapidly
   shrinking toward several tens of nanometers, which results in the
   quantum confinement effect. Starting from the basic piezoelectricity
   equation, Schrodinger equation, Poisson equation, and Fermi's golden
   rule, a self-consistent theoretical model is proposed to study the
   piezo-phototronic effect in the framework of perturbation theory in
   quantum mechanics. The validity and universality of this model are
   well-proven with photoluminescence measurements in a single GaN/InGaN
   quantum well and multiple GaN/InGaN quantum wells. This study provides
   important insight into the working principle of nanoscale
   piezo-phototronic devices as well as guidance for the future device
   design.}},

Abstract = {{The development of strategies for increasing the lifetime of
   photoexcited charge carriers in nanostructured metal oxide
   semiconductors is important for enhancing their photocatalytic activity.
   Intensive efforts have been made in tailoring the properties of the
   nanostructured photo catalysts through different ways, mainly including
   band-structure engineering, doping, catalyst support interaction, and
   loading cocatalysts. In liquid-phase photo catalytic dye degradation and
   water splitting, it was recently found that nanocrystal superstructure
   based semiconductors exhibited improved spatial separation of photo
   excited charge carriers and enhanced photocatalytic performance.
   Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether this strategy is applicable in
   gas-phase photocatalysis. Using porous indium oxide nanorods in
   catalyzing the reverse water gas shift reaction as a model system, we
   demonstrate here that assembling semiconductor nanocrystals into
   superstructures can also promote gas-phase photocatalytic processes.
   Transient absorption studies prove that the improved activity is a
   result of prolonged photoexcited charge carrier lifetimes due to the
   charge transfer within the nanocrystal network comprising the nanorods.
   Our study reveals that the spatial charge separation within the
   nanocrystal networks could also benefit gas-phase photocatalysis and
   sheds light on the design principles of efficient nanocrystal
   superstructure based photocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Durability and hemodynamic performance are top
   considerations in selecting a valve for valve replacement surgery. This
   study was conducted in order to evaluate the long-term mechanical
   durability and hydrodynamic performance of the Carpentier-Edwards
   PERIMOUNT Magna Ease Bioprostheses, through 1 billion cycles (equivalent
   to 25 years).
   Methods. In vitro valve hydrodynamic performance, durability, and
   quantitative flow visualization were conducted in accordance with ISO
   5840: 2005 heart valve standard. The study valves were subjected to
   accelerated valve cycling to an equivalent of 25 years of wear.
   Hydrodynamic evaluations at intervals of 100 million cycles (2.5 years)
   were performed on the study valves. New uncycled Magna Ease valves were
   used as hydrodynamic controls in this study. A quantitative assessment
   of the fluid motion downstream of the control and study valves was
   performed using particle image velocimetry. The results between the test
   and control valves were compared to assess valve performance after an
   equivalent of 25 years of wear.
   Results. All study valvesmet the ISO 5840 requirements for effective
   orifice area, 1.81 +/- 0.06 cm(2) and 2.06 +/- 0.17 cm(2), and
   regurgitant fraction, 1.11\% +/- 0.87\% and 2.5\% +/- 2.34\%, for the 21
   mm and 23 mm study valves, respectively. The flow characterization of
   the control valves and the billion-cycle valves demonstrated that the
   valves exhibited similar flow characteristics. The velocity and shear
   stress fields were similar between the control and study valves.
   Conclusions. The Magna Ease valves demonstrated excellent durability and
   hydrodynamic performance after an equivalent of 25 years of simulated in
   vitro wear. All study valves successfully endured 1 billion cycles of
   simulated wear, 5 times longer than the standard requirement for a
   tissue valve as stipulated in ISO 5840. (C) 2016 by The Society of

Abstract = {{Background. It is known that respiration modulates cavopulmonary flows,
   but little data compare mean flows under breath-holding and
   free-breathing conditions to isolate the respiratory effects and effects
   of exercise on the respiratory modulation.
   Methods. Real-time phase-contrast magnetic resonance combined with a
   novel method to track respiration on the same image acquisition was used
   to investigate respiratory effects on Fontan caval and aortic flows
   under breath-holding, free-breathing, and exercise conditions.
   Respiratory phasicity indices that were based on beat-averaged flow were
   used to quantify the respiratory effect.
   Results. Flow during inspiration was substantially higher than
   expiration under the free-breathing and exercise conditions for both
   inferior vena cava (inspiration/expiration: 1.6 +/- 0.5 and 1.8 +/- 0.5,
   respectively) and superior vena cava (inspiration/expiration: 1.9 +/-
   0.6 and 2.6 +/- 2.0, respectively). Changes from rest to exercise in the
   respiratory phasicity index for these vessels further showed the impact
   of respiration. Total systemic venous flow showed no significant
   statistical difference between the breath-holding and free-breathing
   conditions. In addition, no substantial difference was found between the
   descending aorta and inferior vena cava mean flows under either resting
   or exercise conditions.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrated that inferior vena cava and
   superior vena cava flow time variance is dominated by respiratory
   effects, which can be detected by the respiratory phasicity index.
   However, the minimal respiration influence on net flow validates the
   routine use of breath-holding techniques to measure mean flows in Fontan
   patients. Moreover, the mean flows in the inferior vena cava and
   descending aorta are interchangeable. (C) 2016 by The Society of

Title = {{Transport across Schlemm's canal endothelium and the blood-aqueous
   barrier}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{17-21}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The majority of trabecular outflow likely crosses Schlemm's canal (SC)
   endothelium through micron-sized pores, and SC endothelium provides the
   only continuous cell layer between the anterior chamber and episcleral
   venous blood. SC endothelium must therefore be sufficiently porous to
   facilitate outflow, while also being sufficiently restrictive to
   preserve the blood-aqueous barrier and prevent blood and serum proteins
   from entering the eye. To understand how SC endothelium satisfies these
   apparently incompatible functions, we examined how the diameter and
   density of SC pores affects retrograde diffusion of serum proteins
   across SC endothelium, i.e. from SC lumen into the juxtacanalicular
   tissue (JCT). Opposing retrograde diffusion is anterograde bulk flow
   velocity of aqueous humor passing through pores, estimated to be
   approximately 5 mm/s. As a result of this relatively large through-pore
   velocity, a mass transport model predicts that upstream (JCT)
   concentrations of larger solutes such as albumin are less than 1\% of
   the concentration in SC lumen. However, smaller solutes such as glucose
   are predicted to have nearly the same concentration in the JCT and SC.
   In the hypothetical case that, rather than micron sized pores, SC formed
   65 nm fenestrae, as commonly observed in other filtration-active
   endothelia, the predicted concentration of albumin in the JCT would
   increase to approximately 50\% of that in SC. These results suggest that
   the size and density of SC pores may have developed to allow SC
   endothelium to maintain the blood-aqueous barrier while simultaneously
   facilitating aqueous humor outflow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the interaction between diamond grits and
   crystalline silicon (c-Si) in the ductile regime of diamond wire sawing
   through theoretical calculations and finite element modeling (FEM).
   Cutting depth per grit is calculated based on the sawing parameters and
   is found to be in the range of 41 to 143 nm for a typical diamond wire
   sawing operation. These depths are smaller than the critical depth of
   cut for brittle-to-ductile cutting mode transition in single point
   diamond turning/scribing of c-Si as well as the value derived from
   indentation fracture mechanics. The shape of the cutting grit plays an
   important role in determining the normal force and the critical depth of
   cut. The cutting force calculated by the FEM is approximately 12 mN for
   a spherical grit/indenter shape and 30 mN for a faceted pyramidal
   (Vickers) indenter at a 70-nm scribing depth. It is shown ductile mode
   cutting performance is sensitive to grit shape, and grits with sharp
   edges can easily lead to brittle fracture. The theoretical cutting depth
   per grit indicates the likely dominance of ductile mode cutting in
   diamond wire sawing, albeit, in reality, it is usually a mixture of
   ductile and brittle cutting. This discrepancy is more likely related to
   the grit size and shape variation in an actual diamond wire as well as
   to the dynamics of the operation.}},

Abstract = {{Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most popular additive
   manufacturing technologies for fabricating prototypes with complex
   geometry and different materials. However, current commercial FDM
   machines have the limitations in process reliability and product
   quality. In order to overcome these limitations and increase the levels
   of machine intelligence and automation, machine conditions need to be
   monitored more closely as in closed-loop control systems. In this study,
   a new method for in situ monitoring of FDM machine conditions is
   proposed, where acoustic emission (AE) technique is applied. The
   proposed method allows for the identification of both normal and
   abnormal states of the machine conditions. The time-domain features of
   AE hits are used as the indicators. Support vector machines with the
   radial basis function kernel are applied for state identification.
   Experimental results show that this new method can potentially serve as
   a nonintrusive diagnostic and prognostic tool for FDM machine
   maintenance and process control.}},

Abstract = {{Design and analysis of an atmospheric-breathing propulsion system to
   land large-scale spacecraft (10 + t) on Mars was performed. Mg-CO2
   propulsion feasibility was analytically investigated by employing
   equilibrium combustion simulations, finite-rate kinetics simulations,
   and first-order propellant mass and inlet sizing. I-SP values (based on
   total propellant usage) were determined to be on the order of 120-160 s
   for onboard subsystems having a 10-to-1 oxidizer compression ratio. This
   corresponds to an I-SP of 600-800 s based on onboard fuel consumption.
   Although Mg-CO2 mixtures have significant ignition constraints,
   favorable conditions were found, yielding ignition delay times of less
   than 1 ms, by simultaneously employing designs exploiting both large
   reentry Mach numbers (M = 4 +) and modest compression ratios. These
   combinations allow for combustion to occur within moderately sized
   combustion chambers. The first-order sizing calculations confirmed that
   atmospheric-breathing supersonic retropropulsion has the potential for
   significant mass savings relative to traditional architectures. Designs
   with higher oxidizer-to-fuel ratios were more mass efficient. The
   largest benefit was seen for small inlet area vehicles that leveraged
   deceleration from a terminal instantaneous burn over higher thrust
   throughout the trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{A physics-based dynamic model of a twin-spool turboshaft engine that
   drives a variable pitch propeller is developed. The primary purpose for
   the development of this model is for researchers to use it to develop
   new engine control algorithms and study/predict off-design transient
   responses of gas turbine propulsion systems. In this model, the dynamics
   of the engine are defined to be the two spool speeds, and the control
   inputs are defined to be the fuel flow rate and the propeller pitch
   angle. Mockups of the turboshaft engine and the variable pitch propeller
   are developed using CAD software, and based on the mockups, a test stand
   for gas turbine engine static tests is developed. Experimental results
   are used to verify the dynamic model of the JetCat SPT5 turboshaft
   engine with a variable pitch propeller mounted on it. Based on
   experimental data, realistic performance maps of the engine components,
   including the high-pressure compressor, high-and low-pressure turbines,
   and variable pitch propeller are constructed and integrated in the
   model. The developed engine model is then validated with experimental
   results for various propeller pitch angles. The engine numerical model
   is implemented using MATLAB, and open-loop simulation results for large
   throttle commands are presented.}},

Abstract = {{During metastasis, cells can use proteolytic activity to form tube-like
   ``microtracks{''} within the extracellular matrix (ECM). Using these
   microtracks, cells can migrate unimpeded through the stroma. To
   investigate the molecular mechanisms of microtrack migration, we
   developed an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) micromolded collagen
   platform. When in microtracks, cells tend to migrate unidirectionally.
   Because focal adhesions are the primary mechanism by which cells
   interact with the ECM, we examined the roles of several focal adhesion
   molecules in driving unidirectional motion. Vinculin knockdown results
   in the repeated reversal of migration direction compared with control
   cells. Tracking the position of the Golgi centroid relative to the
   position of the nucleus centroid reveals that vinculin knockdown
   disrupts cell polarity in microtracks. Vinculin also directs migration
   on two-dimensional (2D) substrates and in 3D uniform collagen matrices,
   as indicated by reduced speed, shorter net displacement, and decreased
   directionality in vinculin-deficient cells. In addition, vinculin is
   necessary for focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation in three
   dimensions, as vinculin knockdown results in reduced FAK activation in
   both 3D uniform collagen matrices and microtracks but not on 2D
   substrates, and, accordingly, FAK inhibition halts cell migration in 3D
   microtracks. Together these data indicate that vinculin plays a key role
   in polarization during migration.}},

Title = {{Microscopic origins of the terahertz carrier relaxation and cooling
   dynamics in graphene}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers in graphene are key to both
   understanding of fundamental carrier-carrier interactions and
   carrier-phonon relaxation processes in two-dimensional materials, and
   understanding of the physics underlying novel high-speed electronic and
   optoelectronic devices. Many recent experiments on hot carriers using
   terahertz spectroscopy and related techniques have interpreted the
   variety of observed signals within phenomenological frameworks, and
   sometimes invoke extrinsic effects such as disorder. Here, we present an
   integrated experimental and theoretical programme, using ultrafast
   timeresolved terahertz spectroscopy combined with microscopic modelling,
   to systematically investigate the hot-carrier dynamics in a wide array
   of graphene samples having varying amounts of disorder and with either
   high or low doping levels. The theory reproduces the observed dynamics
   quantitatively without the need to invoke any fitting parameters,
   phenomenological models or extrinsic effects such as disorder. We
   demonstrate that the dynamics are dominated by the combined effect of
   efficient carrier-carrier scattering, which maintains a thermalized
   carrier distribution, and carrier-optical-phonon scattering, which
   removes energy from the carrier liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate pattern matching (APM) targets to find the occurrences of a
   pattern inside a subject text allowing a limited number of errors. It
   has been widely used in many application areas such as bioinformatics
   and information retrieval. Bit-parallel APM takes advantage of the
   intrinsic parallelism of bitwise operations inside a machine word. This
   approach typically encodes non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA)
   states or value differences between adjacent cells of a dynamic
   programming matrix in the form of bit arrays. Wu-Manber (WM) is a
   well-known bit-parallel APM algorithm, which simulates an NFA and gains
   parallel efficiency by performing multiple state updates within a
   machine word. An important parameter is the machine word size (e.g. 32
   or 64 bits for CPUs). Due to increasing vector capabilities, efficient
   mapping of bit-parallel APM algorithms onto modern high performance
   computing architectures is an interesting research topic. Prominent
   examples are Xeon Phi coprocessors and CUDA-enabled GPUs, which provide
   words of size 512 bits (by means of vector registers) and 1024 bits (by
   means of warps), respectively. In this paper, we investigate mappings of
   the WM algorithm onto these two accelerator types. Both architectures
   are able to achieve around two orders-of-magnitude speedups compared to
   a single-threaded CPU implementation. Moreover, our tile-based
   implementation on a GeForce Titan graphics card runs up to 2.9 x faster
   than our implementation on an Intel Xeon Phi 5110P. Source code is

   obtained for sensors whose sensitivities are varied for a diversity of
   nanostructured metal oxides which are applied to a porous silicon (PS)
   interface. We focus on NOx and SO2 and include additional new
   evaluations for the response to H2S. In all cases, the response to these
   inorganic analytes strongly dominates that for toluene, benzene, and
   xylene. The responses are also consistent with the recently developing
   inverse hard/soft acid/base concept. The nanostructure
   metal-oxide-decorated PS conductometric sensors are found to have
   selectivity ratios well in excess of 10(4):1 for toluene and benzene and
   well in excess of 10(3):1 for xylene. The dominance of the response of
   these small inorganic sulfur and nitrogen compounds has important
   implications for the monitoring of significant contaminants associated
   with the venting and flaring of natural gas pits, as they can be present
   in oil and gas formations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes and benchmarks a new implementation of image-based
   deformation measurement for geotechnical applications. The updated
   approach combines a range of advances in image analysis algorithms and
   techniques best suited to geotechnical applications. Performance
   benchmarking of the new approach has used a series of artificial images
   subjected to prescribed spatially varying displacement fields. An
   improvement by at least a factor of 10 in measurement precision is
   achieved relative to the most commonly used particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) approach for all deformation modes, including rigid-body
   displacements, rotations, and strains (compressive and shear). Lastly,
   an example analysis of a centrifuge model test is used to demonstrate
   the capabilities of the new approach. The strain field generated by
   penetration of a flat footing and an entrapped sand plug into an
   underlying clay layer is computed and compared for both the current and
   updated algorithms. This analysis demonstrates that the enhanced
   measurement precision improves the clarity of the interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{A series of pore-water pressure dissipation records were acquired using
   a type 2 piezocone penetrometer sounding that was performed in the
   sensitive Leda clays underlying the Canadian Geotechnical Research site
   in South Gloucester, Ontario. This note presents the results of the
   piezocone penetration test (CPTu) sounding and the individual pore-water
   pressure decays with time that were measured at 1 m vertical intervals,
   ranging from depths of 2 to 23 m at the site. Using soil behavioral
   charts, the sounding confirmed the presence of soft sensitive clays.
   While many of the dissipations were predominantly monotonic, some
   dilatory response was also observed at shallow depths. Thus, a grouping
   of dissipatory behaviors was used to infer layers of similar clay
   characteristics. The results are offered as complementary data to
   existing in situ and laboratory information that have been collected at
   this important experimental test site.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainties exist widely at the planning and design stages of district
   cooling systems, which have significant impacts on the design
   optimization. This paper therefore proposes a design method for district
   cooling systems by quantifying the uncertainties, which is so-called
   uncertainty-based design optimization method. Uncertainties in the
   outdoor weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are
   considered. The application of the uncertainty-based design optimization
   method is examined in several aspects: the performance assessment,
   system sizing, configuration selection and technology integration. With
   the performance distribution at different risk levels, the design of
   district cooling systems can be determined by the stakeholders based on
   the compromise between quantified risk and benefit. Sensitivity analysis
   is conducted to identify influential variables with uncertainties for
   the cooling loads of district cooling systems. Results show that the
   uncertainties in the indoor condition are the most important and the
   uncertainties in building design/construction have the least impact. (C)

Abstract = {{Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) present a variety of new
   research challenges. Magnetic induction (MI)-based transmission has been
   proposed to overcome the very harsh propagation conditions in
   underground communications in recent years. In this approach, induction
   coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. This solution
   achieves larger transmission ranges compared with the traditional
   electromagnetic wave-based approach. In the past, some efforts have been
   made to characterize the signal transmission in MI-WUSNs. Those
   investigations, however, mostly refer to the information transmission.
   One of the open issues that may constrain the system design in some of
   the applications is the powering of the individual sensor nodes. Due to
   the low accessibility of the nodes, a new method of wireless power
   transfer for MI-WUSNs is proposed in this paper. This method is mainly
   based on simultaneous signal transmissions from multiple sensor nodes
   with optimized signal constellations. Furthermore, the optimal
   scheduling for power transmission and reception is provided, which
   maximizes the energy efficiency of the network charging procedure. The
   proposed method is compared with the naive approaches and shows a
   significant improvement of the system performance in terms of energy
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Multicell coordinated beamforming (CB) can mitigate intercell

   to cell-edge users. CB that maximizes the harmonic sum of
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) can be derived into a
   low-complexity algorithm that favors cell-edge users. Two iterative
   algorithms are developed. From the simulation results, the proposed
   algorithms canprovide a better fifth-percentile user throughput compared
   with the CB algorithms minimizing mean square error, maximizing uplink
   SINR, and maximizing weighted sum rate. Furthermore, the computational
   complexity of the proposed algorithms is significantly lower than that
   maximizing the minimum SINR of users.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of this study is to present and evaluate the
   integration of a low resource JavaScript based ECG training interface
   (CrowdLabel) and a standardised curriculum for self-guided tuition in
   ECG interpretation.
   Methods: Participants practiced interpreting ECGs weekly using the
   CrowdLabel interface to assist with the learning of the traditional
   didactic taught course material during a 6 week training period. To
   determine competency students were tested during week 7.
   Results: A total of 245 unique ECG cases were submitted by each student.
   Accuracy scores during the training period ranged from 0-59.5\% (median
   = 33.3\%). Conversely accuracy scores during the test ranged from 30 -
   70\% (median = 37.5\%) (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between
   students who interpreted high numbers of ECGs during the training period
   and their marks obtained.
   Conclusions: CrowdLabel is shown to be a readily accessible dedicated
   learning platform to support ECG interpretation competency. (C) 2016

Title = {{Are Rogue Waves Really Unexpected?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An unexpected wave is defined by Gemmrich and Garrett as a wave that is
   much taller than a set of neighboring waves. Their definition of
   ``unexpected'' refers to a wave that is not anticipated by a casual
   observer. Clearly, unexpected waves defined in this way are predictable
   in a statistical sense. They can occur relatively often with a small or
   moderate crest height, but large unexpected waves that are rogue are
   rare. Here, this concept is elaborated and statistically described based
   on a third-order nonlinear model. In particular, the conditional return
   period of an unexpected wave whose crest exceeds a given threshold is
   developed. This definition leads to greater return periods or on average
   less frequent occurrences of unexpected waves than those implied by the
   conventional return periods not conditioned on a reference threshold.
   Ultimately, it appears that a rogue wave that is also unexpected would
   have a lower occurrence frequency than that of a usual rogue wave. As
   specific applications, the Andrea and Wave Crest Sensor Intercomparison
   Study (WACSIS) rogue wave events are examined in detail. Both waves
   appeared without warning and their crests were nearly 2 times larger
   than the surrounding O(10) wave crests and thus unexpected. The two
   crest heights are nearly the same as the threshold h(0.3)x10(6) similar
   to 1.6H(s) exceeded on average once every 0.3 x 10(6) waves, where H-s
   is the significant wave height. In contrast, the Andrea and WACSIS
   events, as both rogue and unexpected, would occur slightly less often
   and on average once every 3 x 10(6) and 0.6 x 10(6) waves, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive nitrogen emissions into the atmosphere are increasing as a
   result of human activities, affecting nitrogen deposition to the surface
   and impacting the productivity of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. An
   atmospheric chemistry-transport model {[}Tracer Model 4 of the
   Environmental Chemical Processes Laboratory (TM4-ECPL)] is here used to
   calculate the global distribution of total nitrogen deposition,
   accounting for the first time for both its inorganic and organic
   fractions in gaseous and particulate phases and past and projected
   changes due to anthropogenic activities. The anthropogenic and
   biomass-burning Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison
   Project (ACCMIP) historical and RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios
   are used. Accounting for organic nitrogen (ON) primary emissions, the
   present-day global nitrogen atmospheric source is about 60\%
   anthropogenic, while total N deposition increases by about 20\% relative
   to simulations without ON primary emissions. About 20\%-25\% of total
   deposited N is ON. About 10\% of the emitted nitrogen oxides are
   deposited as ON instead of inorganic nitrogen (IN), as is considered in
   most global models. Almost a threefold increase over land (twofold over
   the ocean) has been calculated for soluble N deposition due to human
   activities from 1850 to present. The investigated projections indicate
   significant changes in the regional distribution of N deposition and
   chemical composition, with reduced compounds gaining importance relative
   to oxidized ones, but very small changes in the global total flux.
   Sensitivity simulations quantify uncertainties due to the investigated
   model parameterizations of IN partitioning onto aerosols and of N
   chemically fixed on organics to be within 10\% for the total soluble N
   deposition and between 25\% and 35\% for the dissolved ON deposition.
   Larger uncertainties are associated with N emissions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Over the last decade, melt electrospinning has emerged as an alternative
   polymer processing technology to alleviate concerns associated with
   solvents in traditional electrospinning. This has resulted in the
   fabrication of ultrafine fibers from an increasing range of synthetic
   polymers and composite systems, to materials including ceramics, driving
   new applications in technical areas such as textiles, filtration,
   environment and energy as well as biomedicine. In this article, we
   review the significant advancements in theoretical modeling of the
   underlying physical principles, coupled with experimental validation
   using a variety of technical devices and designs that allows
   well-controlled fiber formation using optimized material and operating
   parameters. Innovative device designs are indicating avenues towards
   higher throughput of randomly collected melt electrospun fibers for the
   production of commodity nonwoven substrates, similar to solution
   electrospinning and many other industrial fiber-forming processes.
   However, we identify a recent shift in perception towards melt
   electrospinning in the literature, where the adaptation of additive
   manufacturing approaches to device designs enables precise fiber
   placement with filament resolutions not yet demonstrated by more
   established melt-extrusion based direct writing technologies. New,
   highly ordered arrangements of ultrafine fibers with distinctive surface
   topology, encapsulating and sensing properties are opening new fields of
   application in areas such as drug delivery, biosensors and regenerative
   medicine as high performance materials. The development of these
   materials is reviewed with an emphasis on an area of current research,
   where melt electrospun scaffolds are contributing to promising treatment
   strategies to regenerate or replace human tissue and for the new field
   of in vitro disease models as well as humanized mice models. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) hold promise in promoting vascular
   regeneration of ischemic tissue in conditions like critical limb
   ischemia of the leg. However, this approach has been limited in part by
   poor cell retention and survival after delivery. New biomaterials offer
   an opportunity to localize cells to the desired tissue after delivery,
   but also to improve cell survival after delivery. Here we characterize
   the mechanical and microstructural properties of a novel hydrogel
   composed of pooled human platelet lysate (PL) and test its ability to
   promote MSC angiogenic activity using clinically relevant in vitro and
   in vivo models. This PL hydrogel had comparable storage and loss modulus
   and behaved as a viscoelastic solid similar to fibrin hydrogels despite
   having 1/4-1/10th the fibrin content of standard fibrin gels.
   Additionally, PL hydrogels enabled sustained release of endogenous
   PDGF-BB for up to 20 days and were resistant to protease degradation. PL
   hydrogel stimulated pro-angiogenic activity by promoting human MSC
   growth and invasion in a 3D environment, and enhancing endothelial cell
   sprouting alone and in co-culture with MSCs. When delivered in vivo, the
   combination of PL and human MSCs improved local tissue perfusion after 8
   days compared to controls when assessed with laser Doppler perfusion
   imaging in a murine model of hind limb ischemia. These results support
   the use of a PL hydrogel as a scaffold for MSC delivery to promote
   vascular regeneration.
   Statement of Significance
   Innovative strategies for improved retention and viability of
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are needed for cellular therapies. Human
   platelet lysate is a potent serum supplement that improves the expansion
   of MSCs. Here we characterize our novel PL hydrogel's desirable
   structural and biologic properties for human MSCs and endothelial cells.
   PL hydrogel can localize cells for retention in the desired tissue,
   improves cell viability, and augments MSCs' angiogenic activity. As a
   result of these unique traits, PL hydrogel is ideally suited to serve as
   a cell delivery vehicle for MSCs injected into ischemic tissues to
   promote vascular regeneration, as demonstrated here in a murine model of
   hindlimb ischemia. (C) Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Acta

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction of neat
   ethanol with bound and non-bound water in completely demineralized
   dentin that is fully hydrated, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
   method. The key to creating ideal resin-dentin bonds is the removal of
   residual free water layers and its replacement by ethanol solvent in
   which resin monomers are soluble, using the ethanol wet bonding
   technique. The test null hypotheses were that ethanol cannot remove any
   collagen-bound water, and that ethanol cannot infiltrate into the
   spacing between collagen triple helix due to narrow interlayer spacing.
   Collagen fibrillar structures of overlap and gap regions were
   constructed by aligning the collagen triple helix of infinite length in
   hexagonal packing. Three layers of the water molecules were specified as
   the layers of 0.15-0.22 nm, 0.22-0.43 nm and 0.43-0.63 nm from collagen
   atoms by investigating the water distribution surrounding collagen
   molecules. Our simulation results show that ethanol molecules
   infiltrated into the intermolecular spacing in the gap region, which
   increased due to the lateral shrinkage of the collagen structures in
   contact with ethanol solution, while there was no ethanol infiltration
   observed in the overlap region. Infiltrated ethanol molecules in the gap
   region removed residual water molecules via modifying mostly the third
   water layer (50\% decrease), which would be considered as a
   loosely-bound water layer. The first and second hydration layers, which
   would be considered as tightly bound water layers, were not removed by
   the ethanol molecules, thus maintaining the helical structures of the
   collagen molecules. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Inhibiting Sn coarsening to enhance the reversibility of conversion
   reaction in lithiated SnO2 anodes by application of super-elastic NiTi
   films}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{248-258}},

Abstract = {{The large capacity loss and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of a
   conventional SnO2-based anode for Li ion batteries are originated
   largely from the limited reversibility of the conversion reaction
   associated with the anode. Often, the reversibility of the
   lithiation/delithiation of SnO2 (with a high ICE value of similar to
   82\%) declines with Sn coarsening in the Sn/Li2O mixture during cycling,
   leading to gradual capacity decay. Here we demonstrate that the
   application of super-elastic films of NiTi alloy could accommodate the
   internal stress and volume change of lithiated nano-SnO2 layer in a
   tri-layer NiTi/SnO2/NiTi sandwich anode, effectively suppressing Sn
   coarsening. This unique electrode configuration has helped to retain the
   high reversibility of the SnO2 layer with reversible capacity more than
   800 mAh/g (based on SnO2) for over 300 cycles, demonstrating stable
   charge capacities of similar to 400 mAh/g in the potential ranges of
   0.01 -1.0 V and 1.0-2.0 V(vs. Li/Li+), respectively. Insitu
   spectroscopic and exsitu diffraction analyses corroborate the highly
   reversible electrochemical cycling, confirming that the reversibility
   and cyclability of SnO2 anodes can be dramatically enhanced by
   preserving the nanostructure of Sn/Li2O mixture, which facilitates the
   reversible conversion reaction. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Although the source of drinking water (DW) used in hospitals is commonly
   disinfected, biofilms forming on water pipelines are a refuge for
   bacteria, including possible pathogens that survive different
   disinfection strategies. These biofilm communities are only beginning to
   be explored by culture-independent techniques that circumvent the
   limitations of conventional monitoring efforts. Hence, theories
   regarding the frequency of opportunistic pathogens in DW biofilms and
   how biofilm members withstand high doses of disinfectants and/or
   chlorine residuals in the water supply remain speculative. The aim of
   this study was to characterize the composition of microbial communities
   growing on five hospital shower hoses using both 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing of bacterial isolates and whole-genome shotgun metagenome
   sequencing. The resulting data revealed a Mycobacterium-like population,
   closely related to Mycobacterium rhodesiae and Mycobacterium tusciae, to
   be the predominant taxon in all five samples, and its nearly complete
   draft genome sequence was recovered. In contrast, the fraction recovered
   by culture was mostly affiliated with Proteobacteria, including members
   of the genera Sphingomonas, Blastomonas, and Porphyrobacter. The biofilm
   community harbored genes related to disinfectant tolerance (2.34\% of
   the total annotated proteins) and a lower abundance of virulence
   determinants related to colonization and evasion of the host immune
   system. Additionally, genes potentially conferring resistance to
   beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, amphenicol, and quinolone antibiotics were
   detected. Collectively, our results underscore the need to understand
   the microbiome of DW biofilms using metagenomic approaches. This
   information might lead to more robust management practices that minimize
   the risks associated with exposure to opportunistic pathogens in
   hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the effect of pressure for the formation of nanomaterials is

   single reaction system, i.e., mesoporous nanospheres, nanoporous
   mesocrystals, hollow nanospheres, and nanowires. They all comprise small
   nanoclusters (3-5 nm). Properly adjusting the reaction pressure allows
   for achieving the transition between them. Furthermore, the
   corresponding pressure-induced self-assembly (Ostwald ripening,
   reconstruction) mechanisms are proposed to illustrate the morphological
   evolution process. In addition, they also display large specific surface
   area and excellent catalytic activity for CO oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular systems are rapidly evolving from a homogeneous macrocell
   deployment to a heterogeneous deployment of macrocells overlaid with
   many small cells. The striking features of small cells include small
   coverage area, ad-hoc deployment, and flexible backhaul connectivity.
   These features call for a profound rethinking of traditional cellular
   concepts including mobility management and interference management among
   others. Owing to the unique features, coordinated small cells or
   commonly referred to as network of small cells promises several benefits
   including efficient mobility management in a rapid and scalable fashion.
   The problem of handover in a high-density small cell deployment is
   studied in this work. A novel local anchor-based architecture for a
   static cluster of small cells is proposed using which new handover
   schemes are presented. Such clusters are prevalent in the evolving
   cellular systems involving high-density small cell deployments in urban,
   residential, and enterprise environments. A mathematical framework is
   developed using discrete-time-Markov-models to evaluate the proposed
   schemes. Using this, closed-form expressions for key handover metrics
   including handover cost and interruption time are derived. Extensive
   numerical and simulation studies indicate significant savings of over 50
   percent in the handover costs and, more importantly, up to 80 percent in
   the handover interruption time compared to the existing 3GPP scheme for
   coordinated small cells.}},

Abstract = {{Digital images and video clips collected at construction jobsites are
   commonly used for extracting useful information. Exploring new
   applications for image processing techniques within the area of
   construction engineering and management is a steady growing field of
   research. One of the initial steps for various image processing
   applications is automatically detecting various types of construction
   materials on construction images. In this paper, the authors conducted a
   comparison study to evaluate the performance of different machine
   learning techniques for detection of three common categorists of
   building materials: Concrete, red brick, and OSB boards. The employed
   classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial
   Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this
   goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to
   perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for
   building material detection. The results indicate that for all three
   types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms
   of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results
   also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very
   well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance
   (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with
   color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials
   containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements
   of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces, and the shearing of soil against them, play a crucial role
   in geotechnical engineering. As such, understanding the fundamental
   mechanisms of interface behavior, such as the size, shape, and extent of
   soil shear zones against geomaterial surfaces can lead to better
   understanding and design of geotechnical systems and testing methods.
   The current study presents a series of laboratory studies aimed at
   spatially quantifying shear zones created through soil-geomaterial
   interface shearing including mobilized interface strengths with a focus
   on CPT friction sleeve behavior. Parametric investigations of particle
   shape and size effects were carried out over a range of counterface
   surface roughness values. The results show that conventional
   ``smooth{''} CPT friction sleeves induce solely particle sliding in
   coarse grained soils, while non-clogging textured friction sleeves can
   create a combination of particle shearing and sliding that can allow for
   direct interface measurements in-situ. By varying the amount of texture
   on an interface, the extent of particle shearing can be controlled,
   allowing for improved understanding and treatment of interfaces in
   geotechnical testing and design.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneity in Women's Adherence and Its Role in Optimal Breast Cancer
   Screening Policies}},

Abstract = {{Most major health institutions recommend women to undergo repeat
   mammography screening for early diagnosis of breast cancer, the leading
   cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Although the proportion of
   women who ever had a mammogram is increasing, a majority of women do not
   get repeat mammograms. This paper analyzes the role of heterogeneity in
   women's adherence on optimal mammography screening recommendations. We
   develop a dynamic modeling framework that considers imperfect and
   heterogeneous adherence to screening recommendations. We carefully
   calibrate our model and solve it using real data. Unlike the existing
   breast cancer screening guidelines, our results suggest that adherence
   and heterogeneity in women's adherence behaviors should be explicitly
   considered. In particular, we find that when screening strategies are
   optimized assuming average adherence for everyone, the effect on
   patients with already low adherence would be relatively small, but
   patients with high adherence would be adversely affected. Considering
   imperfect and heterogeneous adherence in the population, our model
   suggests (1) given the current low adherence rates, an aggressive
   screening policy such as annual screening between the ages of 40 and 79
   should be promoted to the general population; (2) screening strategies
   may be adjusted in clinical practice based on women's adherence, and
   screening intervals can be extended to two years for women with a
   history of high adherence; and (3) if the screening patterns change in
   the long run and most regular screeners adopt the most recent U.S.
   Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, then improving overall
   mammography adherence in society becomes more critical.}},

Abstract = {{We consider multistage stochastic programs, in which decisions can adapt
   over time, (i.e., at each stage), in response to observation of one or
   more random variables (uncertain parameters). The case that the time at
   which each observation occurs is decision-dependent, known as stochastic
   programming with endogeneous observation of uncertainty, presents
   particular challenges in handling non-anticipativity. Although such
   stochastic programs can be tackled by using binary variables to model
   the time at which each endogenous uncertain parameter is observed, the
   consequent conditional non-anticipativity constraints form a very large
   class, with cardinality in the order of the square of the number of
   scenarios. However, depending on the properties of the set of scenarios
   considered, only very few of these constraints may be required for
   validity of the model. Here we characterize minimal sufficient sets of
   non-anticipativity constraints, and prove that their matroid structure
   enables sets of minimum cardinality to be found efficiently, under
   general conditions on the structure of the scenario set.}},

Abstract = {{A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a simple and cost effective
   device that converts ambient mechanical energy into electricity based on
   the surface contact electrification of thin films. The limited surface
   charge density may affect the overall performance of the TENG. In this
   paper, a novel electret film based TENG (E-TENG) fabricated by corona
   charging is proposed that greatly enhances the effective surface charge
   density of the thin films as compared to those subjected to contact
   electrification. The short-circuit current, transferred electric charge
   density, and open-circuit voltage of the E-TENG have been investigated,
   using different corona charging voltages, pinpoint distances and times
   in order to explore the optimum experimental conditions. The
   short-circuit current, transferred electric charge density, and
   open-circuit voltage of the E-TENG are found to be about seven times
   larger than those of the ordinary polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film
   based TENG. Based on corona charging, several multilayered E-TENGs have
   been fabricated, and the short-circuit current, transferred electric
   charge density, and open-circuit voltage of the E-TENGs with different
   number of layers are studied for achieving optimal performances. This
   work offers an effective approach for improving the effective surface
   charge density and thereby increasing the output capability of the TENG,
   which would greatly promote TENG applications in self-powered portable
   electronics and sensor networks.}},

   10\% of cells. Under all conditions studied, cell viability loss was
   minimal. Uptake also increased with increasing laser power, increasing
   CB nanoparticle concentration, increasing CB nanoparticle size and
   decreasing laser wavelength. CB nanoparticles enabled uptake better than
   gold nanoparticles or multi-walled carbon nanotubes under the conditions
   studied. Proofof- principle experiments showed intracellular uptake by
   cells in vivo. We conclude that intracellular uptake of molecules using
   laser-activated CB nanoparticles provides a promising approach to
   deliver molecules into cells. From the Clinical Editor: Delivery of
   drugs using nanoparticles as carriers is promising. The authors in this
   study investigated the use of laseractivated carbon nanoparticles to
   increase the cellular uptake of payloads in various parameters. The
   positive data generated should provide further platform for a new
   approach for intracellular delivery of molecules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{An open-source framework for stress-testing non-invasive foetal ECG
   extraction algorithms}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, many studies have been published on the
   extraction of non-invasive foetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) from
   abdominal recordings. Most of these contributions claim to obtain
   excellent results in detecting foetal QRS (FQRS) complexes in terms of
   location. A small subset of authors have investigated the extraction of
   morphological features from the NI-FECG. However, due to the shortage of
   available public databases, the large variety of performance measures
   employed and the lack of open-source reference algorithms, most
   contributions cannot be meaningfully assessed.
   This article attempts to address these issues by presenting a
   standardised methodology for stress testing NI-FECG algorithms,
   including absolute data, as well as extraction and evaluation routines.
   To that end, a large database of realistic artificial signals was
   created, totaling 145.8 h of multichannel data and over one million FQRS
   complexes. An important characteristic of this dataset is the inclusion
   of several non-stationary events (e.g. foetal movements, uterine
   contractions and heart rate fluctuations) that are critical for
   evaluating extraction routines. To demonstrate our testing methodology,
   three classes of NI-FECG extraction algorithms were evaluated: blind
   source separation (BSS), template subtraction (TS) and adaptive methods
   (AM). Experiments were conducted to benchmark the performance of eight
   NI-FECG extraction algorithms on the artificial database focusing on:
   FQRS detection and morphological analysis (foetal QT and T/QRS ratio).
   The overall median FQRS detection accuracies (i.e. considering all
   non-stationary events) for the best performing methods in each group
   were 99.9\% for BSS, 97.9\% for AM and 96.0\% for TS. Both FQRS
   detections and morphological parameters were shown to heavily depend on
   the extraction techniques and signal-to-noise ratio. Particularly, it is
   shown that their evaluation in the source domain, obtained after using a
   BSS technique, should be avoided. Data, extraction algorithms and
   evaluation routines were released as part of the fecgsyn toolbox on
   Physionet under an GNU GPL open-source license. This contribution
   provides a standard framework for benchmarking and regulatory testing of
   NI-FECG extraction algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Non-Invasive foetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG) represents an
   alternative foetal monitoring technique to traditional Doppler
   ultrasound approaches, that is non-invasive and has the potential to
   provide additional clinical information. However, despite the
   significant advances in the field of adult ECG signal processing over
   the past decades, the analysis of NI-FECG remains challenging and
   largely unexplored. This is mainly due to the relatively low
   signal-to-noise ratio of the FECG compared to the maternal ECG, which
   overlaps in both time and frequency.
   This article is intended to be used by researchers as a practical guide
   to NI-FECG signal processing, in the context of the above issues. It
   reviews recent advances in NI-FECG research including: publicly
   available databases, NI-FECG extraction techniques for foetal heart rate
   evaluation and morphological analysis, NI-FECG simulators and the
   methodology and statistics for assessing the performance of the
   extraction algorithms. Reference to the most recent work is given,
   recent findings are highlighted in the form of intermediate summaries,
   references to open source code and publicly available databases are
   provided and promising directions for future research are motivated. In
   particular we emphasise the need and specifications for building a new
   open reference database of NI-FECG signals, and the need for new
   algorithms to be benchmarked on the same database, employing the same
   evaluation statistics. Finally we motivate the need for research in
   NI-FECG to address morphological analysis, since this represent one of
   the most promising avenues for this foetal monitoring modality.}},

Title = {{Equivalent circuit modeling of a piezo-patch energy harvester on a thin
   plate with AC-DC conversion}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{As an alternative to beam-like structures, piezoelectric patch-based
   energy harvesters attached to thin plates can be readily integrated to
   plate-like structures in automotive, marine, and aerospace applications,
   in order to directly exploit structural vibration modes of the host
   system without mass loading and volumetric occupancy of cantilever
   attachments. In this paper, a multi-mode equivalent circuit model of a
   piezo-patch energy harvester integrated to a thin plate is developed and
   coupled with a standard AC-DC conversion circuit. Equivalent circuit
   parameters are obtained in two different ways: (1) from the modal
   analysis solution of a distributed-parameter analytical model and (2)
   from the finite-element numerical model of the harvester by accounting
   for two-way coupling. After the analytical modeling effort, multi-mode
   equivalent circuit representation of the harvester is obtained via
   electronic circuit simulation software SPICE. Using the SPICE software,
   electromechanical response of the piezoelectric energy harvester
   connected to linear and nonlinear circuit elements are computed.
   Simulation results are validated for the standard AC-AC and AC-DC
   configurations. For the AC input-AC output problem, voltage frequency
   response functions are calculated for various resistive loads, and they
   show excellent agreement with modal analysis-based analytical
   closed-form solution and with the finite-element model. For the standard
   ideal AC input-DC output case, a full-wave rectifier and a smoothing
   capacitor are added to the harvester circuit for conversion of the AC
   voltage to a stable DC voltage, which is also validated against an
   existing solution by treating the single-mode plate dynamics as a
   single-degree-of-freedom system.}},

   memory alloy ring}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have great potential in seismic applications
   because of their remarkable superelasticity. Seismic bracing systems
   based on SMAs can mitigate the damage caused by earthquakes. The current
   study investigates a bracing system based on an SMA ring which is
   capable of both re-centering and energy dissipation. This lateral force
   resisting system is a cross-braced system consisting of an SMA ring and
   four tension-only cable assemblies, which can be applied to both new
   construction and seismic retrofit. The performance of this bracing
   system is examined through a quasi-static cyclic loading test and finite
   element (FE) analysis. This paper describes the experimental design in
   detail, discusses the experimental results, compares the performance
   with other bracing systems based on SMAs, and presents an Abaqus FE
   model calibrated on the basis of experimental results to simulate the
   superelastic behavior of the SMA ring. The experimental results indicate
   that the seismic performance of this system is promising in terms of
   damping and re-centering. The FE model can be used in the simulation of
   building structures using the proposed bracing system.}},

Abstract = {{We study linear wave propagation in nonlinear hexagonal lattices capable

   The lattices are composed of a set of masses connected by linear axial

Abstract = {{Process monitoring and fault diagnosis using profile data remains an
   important and challenging problem in statistical process control (SPC).
   Although the analysis of profile data has been extensively studied in
   the SPC literature, the challenges associated with monitoring and
   diagnosis of multichannel (multiple) nonlinear profiles are yet to be
   addressed. Motivated by an application in multioperation forging
   processes, we propose a new modeling, monitoring, and diagnosis
   framework for phase-I analysis of multichannel profiles. The proposed
   framework is developed under the assumption that different profile
   channels have similar structure so that we can gain strength by
   borrowing information from all channels. The multidimensional functional
   principal component analysis is incorporated into change-point models to
   construct monitoring statistics. Simulation results show that the
   proposed approach has good performance in identifying change-points in
   various situations compared with some existing methods. The codes for
   implementing the proposed procedure are available in the supplementary

Abstract = {{Design fixation is a factor that negatively influences the generation of
   novel design concepts (Jansson \& Smith, 1991). When designers fixate,
   they tend to reproduce example features or features from their initial
   ideas. In order to mitigate design fixation, it is crucial to identify
   the factors that influence the extent of design fixation. This paper
   investigates two such factors: the modality of examples and the
   familiarity of designers with the example features. To investigate this,
   an experiment is conducted with mechanical engineering students who were
   asked to generate ideas to solve a peanut sheller design problem. The
   students generated ideas in five different experimental conditions:
   control, where no example was given; the first example given in a sketch
   form; the first example given as a nonfunctional prototype; a second
   example in sketch form; and the second example in a working prototype
   form. The first example was a nonfeasible solution, but it contained
   several features familiar to the participants. The second example was a
   feasible solution, but it contained less familiar features. In order to
   understand the extent of fixation triggered by the examples, three
   metrics were utilized to compare across the experimental conditions: the
   quantity of nonredundant ideas generated by the participants, the
   presence of example features in their solutions, and their fixation to
   the example's energy source. The results showed that in the case of the
   familiar example, the example modality did play an important role in the
   extent of design fixation. Across the examples, it was found that the
   first example containing several familiar features caused more fixation
   than the second one. Overall, this paper shows that the modality in
   which the example was communicated and the presence of familiar features
   in an example influenced the fixation caused by those examples.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative and qualitative differences in the hemostatic
   systems exist between neonates and adults, including the presence of
   fetal fibrinogen, a qualitatively dysfunctional form of fibrinogen that
   exists until 1 yr of age. The consequences of ``fetal{''} fibrinogen on
   clot structure in neonates, particularly in the context of
   surgery-associated bleeding, have not been well characterized. Here, the
   authors examine the sequential changes in clotting components and
   resultant clot structure in a small sample of neonates undergoing
   cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from neonates (n = 10) before
   surgery, immediately after CPB, and after the transfusion of
   cryoprecipitate (i.e., adult fibrinogen component). Clots were formed
   from patient samples or purified neonatal and adult fibrinogen. Clot
   structure was analyzed using confocal microscopy.
   Results: Clots formed from plasma obtained after CPB and after
   transfusion were more porous than baseline clots. Analysis of clots
   formed from purified neonatal and adult fibrinogen demonstrated that at
   equivalent fibrinogen concentrations, neonatal clots lack
   three-dimensional structure, whereas adult clots were denser with
   significant three-dimensional structure. Clots formed from a combination
   of purified neonatal and adult fibrinogen were less homogenous than
   those formed from either purified adult or neonatal fibrinogen.
   Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that significant
   differences exist in clot structure between neonates and adults and that
   neonatal and adult fibrinogen may not integrate well. These findings
   suggest that differential treatment strategies for neonates should be
   pursued to reduce the demonstrated morbidity of blood product
   transfusion.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the Fungi convert nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) to
   gaseous nitrous oxide (N2O) (denitrification), but the fungal
   contributions to N loss from soil remain uncertain. Cultivation-based
   methodologies that include antibiotics to selectively assess fungal
   activities have limitations, and complementary molecular approaches to
   assign denitrification potential to fungi are desirable. Microcosms
   established with soils from two representative U.S. Midwest agricultural
   regions produced N2O from added NO3- or NO2- in the presence of
   antibiotics to inhibit bacteria. Cultivation efforts yielded 214 fungal
   isolates belonging to at least 15 distinct morphological groups, 151 of
   which produced N2O from NO2-. Novel PCR primers targeting the p450nor
   gene, which encodes the nitric oxide (NO) reductase responsible for N2O
   production in fungi, yielded 26 novel p450nor amplicons from DNA of 37
   isolates and 23 amplicons from environmental DNA obtained from two
   agricultural soils. The sequences shared 54 to 98\% amino acid identity
   with reference P450nor sequences within the phylum Ascomycota and expand
   the known fungal P450nor sequence diversity. p450nor was detected in all
   fungal isolates that produced N2O from NO2-, whereas nirK (encoding the
   NO-forming NO2- reductase) was amplified in only 13 to 74\% of the
   N2O-forming isolates using two separate nirK primer sets. Collectively,
   our findings demonstrate the value of p450nor-targeted PCR to complement
   existing approaches to assess the fungal contributions to
   denitrification and N2O formation.
   IMPORTANCE
   A comprehensive understanding of the microbiota controlling soil N loss
   and greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions is crucial for sustainable
   agricultural practices and addressing climate change concerns. We report
   the design and application of a novel PCR primer set targeting fungal
   p450nor, a biomarker for fungal N2O production, and demonstrate the
   utility of the new approach to assess fungal denitrification potential
   in fungal isolates and agricultural soils. These new PCR primers may
   find application in a variety of biomes to assess the fungal
   contributions to N loss and N2O emissions.}},

Abstract = {{There is an immense need to obtain high-quality surface and subsurface
   on brittle material owing to the advantage of its improved performance.
   Thus, in this paper, we proposed a mechanical and numerical study of
   fracture mechanics from the perspective of external loading and
   indentation geometry in brittle machining. Stress intensity factors are
   computed to analyze various impacts of external loading and indentation
   configuration on subsurface crack propagation. Results indicate that the
   main fracture mode for inclined crack is shear rather than opening and
   the apex angle of the indentation plays an important role in fracture
   behavior. As a certain external loading is exerted to the surface of the
   silicon, a large apex angle of indentation may lead to strong shielding
   effect on mode II crack propagation. A relationship between critical
   value of external loading to the crack propagation and the apex angle of
   the indentation is given in this paper that shows quantitative
   indication for suppression of crack growth.}},

Abstract = {{Cathepsins K and V are powerful elastases elevated in endothelial cells
   by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) stimulation and disturbed
   blood flow both of which contribute to inflammation-mediated arterial
   remodeling. However, mechanisms behind endothelial cell integration of
   biochemical and biomechanical cues to regulate cathepsin production are
   not known. To distinguish these mechanisms, human aortic endothelial
   cells (HAECs) were stimulated with TNF alpha and exposed to
   pro-remodeling or vasoprotective shear stress profiles. TNF alpha
   upregulated cathepsin K via JNK/c-jun activation, but vasoprotective
   shear stress inhibited TNF alpha-stimulated cathepsin K expression.
   JNK/c-jun were still phosphorylated, but cathepsin K mRNA levels were
   significantly reduced to almost null indicating separate biomechanical
   regulation of cathepsin K by shear stress separate from biochemical
   stimulation. Treatment with Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of I kappa B alpha
   phosphorylation, was sufficient to block induction of cathepsin K by
   both pro-remodeling shear stress and TNFa, implicating NF-kappa B as the
   biomechanical regulator, and its protein levels were reduced in HAECs by
   vasoprotective shear stress. In conclusion, NF-kappa B and AP-1
   activation were necessary to activate cathepsin K expression in
   endothelial cells, highlighting integration of biochemical and
   biomechanical stimuli to control cathepsins K and V, powerful elastases
   implicated for arterial remodeling due to chronic inflammation and

   significant element flux, and (3) the subsequent identification of the
   global pathway for each hub species by searching a certain number of
   shortest paths with the constructed element flux graphs from the initial
   reactants to the final products through the considered hub species. The
   skeletal mechanism is then obtained by removing the species and
   reactions that are not important to any identified global pathways.
   Validations are performed to generate skeletal mechanisms for the
   combustion of two fuels: n-dodecane, and the mixture of toluene,
   iso-octane, and n-heptane. For both cases, a series of mechanisms are
   generated using GPS, and the maximum error of ignition delays is similar
   or smaller comparing to the skeletal mechanisms generated using Path
   Flux Analysis method (Sun et al., 2010) with similar number of species.
   GPS is further compared with two methods using sensitivity analysis,
   which is usually effective but time consuming. By comparing simulation
   results of ignition delay, perfect stirred reactor (PSR) temperature,
   and laminar flame speed over a wide range of operating conditions, it is
   observed that a 35-species skeletal mechanism generated by GPS for
   n-dodecane shows similar overall accuracy compared with the 31-species
   skeletal mechanism obtained by Direct Relation Graph Aided Sensitivity
   Analysis (Vie et al., 2015). Further validation is conducted for the
   combustion of the mixture of toluene, n-heptane and iso-octane. A
   276-species mechanism generated using DRG with error propagation
   followed by sensitivity analysis and reaction elimination (Niemeyer et
   al., 2014) shows larger errors for PSR temperature and ignition delay
   with fuel composition different from the raw database. However these
   errors can be reduced significantly if GPS-generated mechanism of
   similar size is tested. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Title = {{Effect of axial diffusion on the response of diffusion flames to axial
   flow perturbations}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{395-408}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper elucidates the behavior and dynamics of non-premixed flames
   responding to bulk fluctuations in flow velocity. It expands previous
   work on this problem by consistently incorporating finite Peclet number
   (Pe = U0Rf/D) effects, and differentiating inflow boundary and dynamical
   effects on the flame dynamics. For analytical tractability, prior
   treatments of this problem generally prescribe the inflow boundary
   conditions into the domain. This paper shows, however, that prescribed
   inflow conditions, such as a step or constant local diffusive flux
   boundary condition, neglect axial diffusion effects in the region where
   their effects are most important; i.e., in the near-burner exit region
   where high transverse gradients and mass burning rates control the heat
   release dynamics. As the burning rate of non-premixed flames are
   controlled by mixture fraction gradients, the influence of axial
   diffusion substantively influences several burning rate characteristics
   of the flame. In addition, these effects cause the leading edge position
   of the flame front to oscillate, even for infinitely fast chemistry.
   Even in Pe >> 1 flames, axial diffusion introduces several fundamentally
   new features to the problem, resulting in exponentially decaying,
   dispersive flame wrinkle propagation with downstream distance. Also
   investigated here are asymptotic results for the heat release dynamics.
   It is shown that axial diffusion introduces a triple-zone asymptotic
   structure into the unsteady heat release characteristics, resulting in
   O(1) flame transfer function trends for St << 1 (to which an n-tau model
   is developed), O(1/St(1/2)) for intermediate Strouhal numbers, and
   O(1/St) for high Strouhal numbers. Finally, it is shown that the phase
   of the heat release response is approximately half that of a premixed
   flame with the same length, due to the concentration of unsteady heat
   release near the burner outlet, where transverse gradients are largest.

Title = {{Influence of open ocean nitrogen supply on the skeletal delta N-15 of
   modern shallow-water scleractinian corals}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},

Volume = {{441}},

Abstract = {{The isotopic composition of skeleton-bound organic nitrogen in
   shallow-water scleractinian corals (hereafter, CS-delta N-15) is an
   emerging tool for studying the marine nitrogen cycle in the past. The
   CS-delta N-15 has been shown to reflect the delta N-15 of nitrogen (N)
   sources to corals, with most applications to date focusing on the
   anthropogenic/terrestrial N inputs to reef environments. However, many
   coral reefs receive their primary N sources from the open ocean, and the
   CS-delta N-15 of these corals may provide information on past changes in
   the open ocean regional and global N cycle. Using a recently developed
   persulfate/clenitrifler-based method, we measured CS-delta N-15 in
   modern shallow-water scleractinian corals from 8 sites proximal to the
   open ocean. At sites with low open ocean surface nitrate concentrations
   typical of the subtropics and tropics, measured CS-delta N-15 variation
   on seasonal and annual timescales is most often less than 2 parts per
   thousand. In contrast, a broad range in CS-delta N-15 (of similar to 10
   parts per thousand) is measured across these sites, with a strong
   correlation between CS-delta N-15 and the delta N-15 of the deep nitrate
   supply to the surface waters near the reefs. While CS-delta N-15 can be
   affected by other N sources as well and can vary in response to local
   reef conditions as well as coral/symbiont physiological changes, this
   survey indicates that, when considering corals proximal to the open
   ocean, the delta N-15 of the subsurface nitrate supply to surface waters
   drives most of the CS-delta N-15 variation across the global ocean.
   Thus, CS-delta N-15 is a promising proxy for reconstructing the open
   ocean N cycle in the past. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
