Abstract = {{Periodic patterns resembling spirals were observed to form spontaneously
   upon unassisted cooling of D-glucaric acid- and D-galactaric acid based
   polyamide solutions in N-methyl-N-morpholine oxide (NMMO) monohydrate.
   Similar observations were made in D-galactaric acid-based
   polyamide/ionic liquid (IL) solutions. The morphologies were
   investigated by optical, polarized light and confocal microscopy assays
   to reveal pattern details. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to
   monitor solution thermal behavior. Small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering
   data reflected the complex and heterogeneous nature of the
   self-organized patterns. Factors such as concentration and temperature
   were found to influence spiral dimensions and geometry. The distance
   between rings followed a first-order exponential decay as a function of
   polymer concentration. Fourier-Transform Infrared Microspectroscopy
   analysis of spirals pointed to H-bonding between the solvent and the
   pendant hydroxyl groups of the glucose units from the polymer backbone.
   Tests on self-organization into spirals of ketal-protected D-galactaric
   acid polyamides in NMMO monohydrate confirmed the importance of the
   monosaccharide's pendant free hydroxyl groups on the formation of these
   patterns. Rheology performed on D-galactaric-based polyamides at high
   concentration in NMMO monohydrate solution revealed the optimum
   conditions necessary to process these materials as fibers by spinning.
   The self-organization of these sugar-based polyamides mimics certain
   biological materials.}},

Abstract = {{To develop new and effective chemopreventive agents against bone
   metastasis, we assessed the effects of muscadine grape skin extract
   (MSKE), whose main bioactive component is anthocyanin, on bone turnover,
   using prostate and breast cancer cell models overexpressing Snail
   transcription factor. MSKE has been shown previously to promote
   apoptosis in prostate cancer cells without affecting normal prostate
   epithelial cells. Snail is overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer,
   and is associated with increased invasion, migration and bone
   turnover/osteoclastogenesis. Cathepsin L (CatL) is a cysteine cathepsin
   protease that is overexpressed in cancer and involved in bone turnover.
   Snail overexpression in prostate (LNCaP, ARCaP-E) and breast (MCF-7)
   cancer cells led to increased CatL expression/activity and
   phosphorylated STAT-3 (pSTAT-3), compared to Neo vector controls, while
   the reverse was observed in C4-2 (the aggressive subline of LNCaP) cells
   with Snail knockdown. Moreover, CatL expression was higher in prostate
   and breast tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. MSKE decreased Snail
   and pSTAT3 expression, and abrogated Snail-mediated CatL activity,
   migration and invasion. Additionally, Snail overexpression promoted
   osteoclastogenesis, which was significantly inhibited by the MSKE as
   effectively as Z-FY-CHO, a CatL-specific inhibitor, or osteoprotegerin,
   a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)
   antagonist. Overall, these novel findings suggest that Snail regulation
   of CatL may occur via STAT-3 signaling and can be antagonized by MSKE,
   leading to decreased cell invasion, migration and bone turnover.
   Therefore, inhibition using a natural product such as MSKE could
   potentially be a promising bioactive compound for bone metastatic
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
   aims to relieve the booming energy consumption in wireless
   communications networks and has recently received lots of attention.
   Meanwhile, two-way relay has been extensively studied and proves to be
   more spectral-efficient than direct transmission and one-way relay in
   many scenarios. In this paper, we study energy-efficient resource
   allocation for OFDMA-based two-way relay, maximizing the aggregated
   energy efficiency (EE) utility while provisioning proportional fairness
   in EE among different terminal pairs. The energy-efficient joint power
   and subchannel allocation and active subchannel selection problem is
   mixed-integer combinatorial and further demonstrates to be nonconvex. To
   approach the performance limit, we first find an upper-bound solution
   relying on continuous relaxation and the Lagrange dual method. To reduce
   the computational complexity, we separate power allocation and
   subchannel assignment. To this regard, we exploit the hidden concavity
   and the pseudoconcavity in the subproblems for any fixed subchannel
   assignment and propose an EE-oriented sequential subchannel assignment
   policy. Besides, we discover the sufficient condition for early
   termination of the sequential subchannel assignment without losing the
   EE optimality. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   energy-efficient OFDMA-based two-way relay can achieve much larger EE
   utility while provisioning proportional fairness in EE among different
   terminal pairs compared to its spectral-efficient counterpart.}},

Title = {{On the eigenstrain application of shot-peened residual stresses within a

   specimens}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{100}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Shot-peening-induced compressive residual stresses are often introduced
   in Ni-base superalloy components to help prevent or retard surface
   fatigue crack initiation and early growth at near surface inclusions. In
   certain cases these compressive residual stresses can shift the fatigue
   crack initiation site from surface to sub-surface locations. However,
   the ability to computationally predict the improvement in fatigue life
   response and scatter due to induced compressive residual stresses are
   lightly treated in the literature. To address this issue, a method to
   incorporate shot-peened residual stresses within a 3D polycrystalline
   microstructure is introduced in this work. These residual stresses are
   induced by a distribution of fictitious or quasi-thermal expansion
   eigenstrain as a function of depth from the specimen surface. Two
   different material models are used, a 12 plasticity and a crystal
   plasticity model. First, the J(2) plasticity model with combined
   isotropic and kinematic hardening is used to determine the distribution
   of quasi-thermal expansion eigenstrain as a function of depth from the
   surface necessary to induce the target residual stress profile within
   the microstructure. This distribution of quasi-thermal expansion
   eigenstrain is then used within a crystal plasticity framework to model
   the effect of microstructure heterogeneity on the variability in
   residual stresses among multiple instantiations. This model is verified
   with experimental X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for scatter in residual
   stresses for both the initial microstructure and after a single
   load/unload cycle. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{329}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Ceria-zirconias are popular catalysts and supports for metal particles.
   Even without supported metal particles, these materials are active for
   hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions, where oxygen vacancies
   serve as the active site. To gain a detailed understanding of the
   ability of ceria-based catalysts to dissociatively adsorb hydrogen,
   H-2-D-2 exchange is studied as a test reaction. The density of
   exchangeable hydrogen per surface area approaches the values for typical
   metal surfaces. Below 250 degrees C, H-2-D-2 exchange occurs at oxygen
   vacancies with an activation energy of ca. 24 kJ mol(-1). At higher
   temperatures, additional sites at the edges of ceria-zirconia
   crystallites contribute to the reaction. The kinetics and the density of
   active sites for dissociative adsorption of hydrogen are correlated with
   physicochemical properties of the catalysts. Specifically, the
   crystallite size has a strong influence on the reactivity of different
   samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon deposition on nickel anodes degrades the performance of solid

   nanoclusters deposited on the surface exhibit improved performance by
   delaying carbon deposition (i.e., coking). The goal of this research was
   to visualize early stage deposition of carbon on nickel surface and to
   identify the role BaO nanoclusters play in coking resistance.
   Electrostatic force microscopy was employed to spatially map carbon
   deposition on nickel foils patterned with BaO nanoclusters. Image
   analysis reveals that upon propane exposure initial carbon deposition
   occurs on the Ni surface at a distance from the BaO features. With
   continued exposure, carbon deposits penetrate into the BaO-modified
   regions. After extended exposure, carbon accumulates on and covers BaO.
   The morphology and spatial distribution of deposited carbon was found to
   be sensitive to experimental conditions.}},

   useful example of identification of key elementary steps in a complex
   reaction network for the reactions available with syngas over a

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomass has a complex and rigid cell wall structure that
   makes biomass recalcitrant to biological and chemical degradation. Among
   the three major structural biopolymers (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose,
   and lignin) in plant cell walls, lignin is considered the most
   recalcitrant component and generally plays a negative role in the
   biochemical conversion of biomass to biofuels. The conversion of biomass
   to biofuels through a biochemical platform usually requires a
   pretreatment stage to reduce the recalcitrance. Pretreatment renders
   compositional and structural changes of biomass with these changes
   ultimately governing the efficiency of the subsequent enzymatic
   hydrolysis. Dilute acid, hot water, steam explosion, and ammonia fiber
   expansion pretreatments are among the leading thermochemical
   pretreatments with a limited delignification that can reduce biomass
   recalcitrance. Practical applications of these pretreatment are rapidly
   developing as illustrated by recent commercial scale cellulosic ethanol
   plants. While these thermochemical pretreatments generally lead to only
   a limited delignification and no significant change of lignin content in
   the pretreated biomass, the lignin transformations that occur during
   these pretreatments and the roles they play in recalcitrance reduction
   are important research aspects. This review highlights recent advances
   in our understanding of lignin alterations during these limited
   delignification thermochemical pretreatments, with emphasis on lignin
   chemical structures, molecular weights, and redistributions in the
   pretreated biomass.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1613-1619}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plasma osmolality (POsm) is a gold standard to assess
   hydration status but requires venipuncture. POsm obtained by lancing a
   digit, a source of capillary puncture blood (CAP), has not been
   validated. This study compared POsm from CAP versus venous blood (VEN)
   and validated its sensitivity to detect dehydration.
   Methods: Healthy young adults (Study A: n = 20 men, 22 women; Study B: n
   = 23 men, 23 women) participated. In Study A, CAP and VEN were compared
   under controlled euhydration meeting dietary reference intakes for water
   (3.7 L men, 2.7 L women). In Study B, CAP was assessed for sensitivity
   to detect dehydration with receiver operating characteristic analysis
   over two 24 h periods: euhydration for 24 h followed by water
   restriction over 24 h. POsm was measured using freezing point
   depression.
   Results: For all subjects, CAP POsm (283.0 +/- 3.9 mOsm/kg) was not
   significantly different (p = 0.07) from VEN (284.2 +/- 3.5) during
   euhydration and met analytical goals for individuality and
   heterogeneity. When outliers (n = 3) were eliminated, mean difference
   was -1.6 (+/- 3.2) lower (p < 0.01) with CAP. Fluid restriction
   increased (p < 0.001) CAP POsm (284.0 +/- 4.4 to 292.8 +/- 5.2 mOsm/kg),
   achieving excellent accuracy (0.92) and sensitivity (89.1\%) to predict
   mild dehydration (2\% body mass loss).
   Conclusions: POsm via CAP exhibited similar coefficients of variation
   and analytical goals compared to VEN combined with excellent accuracy
   and sensitivity to detect dehydration. Although CAP values were
   approximately 2 mOsm/kg lower than VEN, CAP appears an adequate
   substitute for tracking changes in non-clinical settings.}},

Title = {{Contribution of Brown Carbon to Direct Radiative Forcing over the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The Indo-Gangetic Plain is a region of known high aerosol loading with
   substantial amounts of carbonaceous aerosols from a variety of sources,
   often dominated by biomass burning. Although black carbon has been shown
   to play an important role in the absorption of solar energy and hence
   direct radiative forcing (DRF), little is known regarding the influence
   of light absorbing brown carbon (BrC) on the radiative balance in the
   region. With this in mind, a study was conducted for a one month period
   during the winter spring season of 2013 in Kanpur, India that measured
   aerosol chemical and physical properties that were used to estimate the
   sources of carbonaceous aerosols, as well as parameters necessary to
   estimate direct forcing by aerosols and the contribution of BrC
   absorption to the atmospheric energy balance. Positive matrix
   factorization analyses, based on aerosol mass spectrometer measurements,
   resolved organic carbon into four factors including low-volatile
   oxygenated organic aerosols, semivolatile oxygenated organic aerosols,
   biomass burning, and hydrocarbon like organic aerosols. Three-wavelength
   absorption and scattering coefficient measurements from a Photo Acoustic
   Soot Spectrometer were used to estimate aerosol optical properties and
   estimate the relative contribution of BrC to atmospheric absorption.
   Mean +/- standard deviation values of short-wave cloud free clear sky
   DRF exerted by total aerosols at the top of atmosphere, surface and
   within the atmospheric column are -6.1 +/- 3.2, -31.6 +/- 11, and 25.5
   +/- 10.2 W/m(2), respectively. During days dominated by biomass burning
   the absorption of solar energy by aerosols within the atmosphere
   increased by similar to 35\%, accompanied by a 25\% increase in negative
   surface DRF. DRF at the top of atmosphere during biomass burning days
   decreased in negative magnitude by several W/m(2) due to enhanced
   atmospheric absorption by biomass aerosols, including BrC. The
   contribution of BrC to atmospheric absorption is estimated to range from
   on average 2.6 W/m(2) for typical ambient conditions to 3.6 W/m(2)
   during biomass burning days. This suggests that BrC accounts for 10-15\%
   of the total aerosol absorption in the atmosphere, indicating that BrC
   likely plays an important role in surface and boundary temperature as
   well as climate.}},

Title = {{A Behavioral Intervention for Reducing Postcompletion Errors in a
   Safety-Critical System}},

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We investigated the effectiveness of a theoretically
   motivated intervention at reducing procedural errors in train yard
   operations, where making these errors could be costly or
   life-threatening.
   Background: A widespread and persistent memory error that people commit
   on a daily basis is the postcompletion error (PCE), that is, forgetting
   to complete the final step of a procedural task in which the final step
   occurs after completion of the task goal. PCEs occur in the railroad
   industry when a locomotive conductor changes the direction of a rail
   switch but fails to report this change. This particular error could
   contribute to unsafe conditions as another train traveling on the same
   track could derail. Although training can help reduce some of the
   factors leading to unsafe conditions on the rail, research has
   demonstrated that PCEs are different from other errors of omission in
   that they cannot be eliminated through training, which makes them a
   difficult problem to address.
   Method: Twenty-eight undergraduates completed train yard tasks within a
   mid-fidelity simulator used in commercial rail operations for training.
   Each participant received the behavioral intervention in one block and
   no intervention in another. Specifically, participants were required to
   perform an additional task designed to remind participants of the
   postcompletion step.
   Results: Our intervention significantly reduced PCE rates in the context
   of train yard operations, on average by 65\%.
   Conclusion: We discuss implications of the effectiveness of our
   intervention at reducing train yard accidents and how this outcome can
   contribute to the literature on the cause of PCEs.
   Application: In cases such as the railroad industry, where redesigning
   technology is prohibitive, our behavioral intervention is an effective
   alternative for significantly reducing PCEs.}},

Abstract = {{Ballistocardiography is a noninvasive measurement of the mechanical
   movement of the body caused by cardiac ejection of blood. Recent studies
   have demonstrated that ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals can be measured
   using a modified home weighing scale and used to track changes in
   myocardial contractility and cardiac output. With this approach, the BCG
   can potentially be used both for preventive screening and for chronic
   disease management applications. However, for achieving high signal
   quality, subjects are required to stand still on the scale in an upright
   position for the measurement; the effects of intentional (for user
   comfort) or unintentional (due to user error) modifications in the
   position or posture of the subject during the measurement have not been
   investigated in the existing literature. In this study, we quantified
   the effects of different standing and seated postures on the measured
   BCG signals, and on the most salient BCG-derived features compared to
   reference standard measurements (e.g., impedance cardiography). We
   determined that the standing upright posture led to the least distorted
   signals as hypothesized, and that the correlation between BCG-derived
   timing interval features (R-J interval) and the preejection period, PEP
   (measured using ICG), decreased significantly with impaired posture or
   sitting position. We further implemented two novel approaches to improve
   the PEP estimates from other standing and sitting postures, using system
   identification and improved J-wave detection methods. These approaches
   can improve the usability of standing BCG measurements in unsupervised
   settings (i.e., the home), by improving the robustness to nonideal
   posture, as well as enabling high-quality seated BCG measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing quality and lifetime testing conditions may affect product
   reliability measurements. The literature for the design of experiments
   (DOE) and robust product optimization considering both quality and

   both manufacturing variables and accelerated degradation test (ADT)
   conditions. A simple algorithm provides calculations of the maximum
   likelihood estimates (MLEs) of these model parameters and percentile
   lifetimes. Variances of these estimates are derived based on large
   sample theory. Our DOE plans focus on deciding replication sizes and
   proportions of the test-units allocated at three stress levels for
   various manufacturing and ADT conditions. This work also explores robust
   parameter design (RPD) optimizations for selected controllable
   manufacturing variables to achieve the longest product lifetime and
   smallest variation in lifetime distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Access to medical care and severe pediatric asthma outcomes
   vary with geography, but the relationship between them has not been
   studied.
   Objective: We sought to evaluate the relationship between geographic
   access and health outcomes for pediatric asthma.
   Methods: The severe outcome measures include emergency department (ED)
   visits and hospitalizations for children with an asthma diagnosis in
   Georgia and North Carolina. We quantify asthma prevalence, outcome
   measures, and factors included in the statistical model using multiple
   data sources. We calculate geographic access to primary and asthma
   specialist care using optimization models. We estimate the association
   between outcomes and geographic access in the presence of other factors
   using logistic regression. The model is used to project the reduction in
   severe outcomes with improvement in access.
   Results: The association between access and outcomes for pediatric
   asthma depends on the type of outcome measure, type of care, and
   variations in other factors. The expression of this association is also
   different for the 2 states. Access to primary care plays a larger role
   than access to specialist care in explaining Georgia ED visits, whereas
   the reverse applies for hospitalizations. In North Carolina access to
   both primary and specialist care are statistically significant in
   explaining the variability in ED visits.
   Conclusions: The variation in the association between estimated access
   and outcomes affects the projected reductions of severe outcomes with
   access improvement. Thus applying one intervention would not have the
   same level of improvement across geography. Interventions must be
   tailored to target regions with the potential to deliver the highest
   effect to gain maximum benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Taxi drivers' cruising patterns are learnt with GPS trajectory data
   collected in Shenzhen, China. By employing Ripley's K function, the
   impacts of land use and pick-up experience on taxis' cruising behavior
   are investigated concerning about both intensity of influence and radius
   of influence. The results indicate that, in general, taxi drivers tend
   to learn more from land use characteristics than from pick-up
   experience. The optimal radius of influence of land use points and
   previous pick-up points is 14.18 km and 9.93 km, respectively. The
   findings also show that the high-earning drivers or thorough drivers pay
   more attention to land use characteristics and tend to cruise in
   high-density area, while the low-earning drivers or focus drivers prefer
   to learn more from previous pick-up experience and select the area which
   is far away from the high-density area. These findings facilitate the
   development of measures of managing taxi's travel behavior by providing
   useful insights into taxis' cruising patterns. The results also provide
   useful advice for taxi drivers to make efficient cruising decision,
   which will contribute to the improvement of cruising efficiency and the
   reduction of negative effects.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular mechanics (MM) force field models have been demonstrated to
   have difficulty reproducing certain potential energy surfaces of
   pi-stacked complexes. Here, we examine the performance of the AMBER and
   CHARMM models relative to high-quality ab initio data across systematic
   helical parameter scans and typical B-DNA geometries for pi-stacking
   energies of nudeobase dimers. These force fields perform best for
   typical B-DNA geometries (mean absolute error < 1 kcal mol(-1)), whereas
   errors typically approach similar to 2 kcal mol(-1) for broader
   potential scans, with maximum errors > 10 kcal mol(-1) relative to
   high-quality ab initio reference interaction energies. The adequate
   performance of MM models near minimum energy structures is accomplished
   through cancellation of errors in various energy terms, whereas large
   errors at short intermolecular distances are caused by large MM
   electrostatics errors due to a lack of explicit terms modeling charge
   penetration effects.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric amines such as poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on
   mesoporous oxides are promising candidate adsorbents for CO2, capture
   processes. An important aspect to the design and optimization of these
   materials is a fundamental understanding of how the properties of the
   oxide support such as pore structure) particle morphology, and surface
   properties affect the efficiency of the guest polymer in its
   interactions with CO2. Previously, the efficiency of impregnated PEI to
   adsorb CO2, was shown to increase upon the addition of Zr as a surface
   modifier in SBA-LS: However, the efficacy of this method to tune the
   adsorption performance has not been explored in materials of differing
   textural and morphological nature. Here, these issues are directly
   addressed via the preparation of an array of SBA-15 support materials
   with varying textural and morphological properties, as well as varying
   content of zirconium doped into the material. Zirconium is incorporated
   into the SBA-15 either during the synthesis of the SBA-15, or
   postsynthetically via deposition of Zr species Onto pure-silica SBA-15.
   The method of Zr incorporation alters the textural and morphological
   properties of the parent SBA-15 in different ways. Importantly, the CO2,
   capacity of SBA-15 impregnated with PEI increases by a maximum
   of,similar to 60\% with the quantity of doped Zr for a ``standard{''}
   SBA-15 containing significant microporosity, while no increase in the
   CO2, capacity is observed upon Zr incorporation for an SBA-15 with
   reduced rnicroporosity and a larger pore size, pore volume, and particle
   size. Finally, adsorbents supported on SBA-LS with controlled particle
   morphology show only modest increases in CO2, capacity upon inclusion of
   Zr to the silica framework. The data demonstrate that the textural and
   morphological properties of the support have a more significant impact
   on the ability of PEI to capture CO2, than the support surface
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of the alloying elements, Sn and Sb, on the corrosion resistance
   of modified AH 32 steel for the cargo oil tanks (COT) were examined
   using an electrochemical test and weight loss measurement. All
   experiments were carried out in acidic chloride solution (0.14 M HCl and
   10 wt\% NaCl, pH 0.85) at 30 degrees C, simulating the inner bottom
   plate of COT. It was clearly found that the small amount addition of Sn
   and Sb improved the corrosion resistance of modified AH 32 steel, which
   is confirmed by the higher polarization resistance of AH 32 steel
   modified with Sn and Sb addition compared with that of the base steel.
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the corroded surface after
   immersion of 72 h presented that the AH 32 steel modified with Sn and Sb
   addition created the protective corrosion products including SnO2 and
   Sb2O5. These oxides act as high corrosion inhibitor to anodic corrosion
   reaction, and hence leading to the improvement in the corrosion
   resistance of the modified AH 32 steels.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{54-64}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{General anesthesia is required for some patients in the intensive care
   units (ICUs) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Critically ill
   patients who are assisted by mechanical ventilators require moderate
   sedation for several days to ensure cooperative and safe treatment in
   the ICU, reduce anxiety and delirium, facilitate sleep, and increase
   patient tolerance to endotracheal tube insertion. However, most
   anesthetics affect cardiac and respiratory functions. Hence, it is
   important to monitor and control the infusion of anesthetics to meet
   sedation requirements while keeping patient vital parameters within safe
   limits. The critical task of anesthesia administration also necessitates
   that drug dosing be optimal, patient specific, and robust. In this
   paper, the concept of reinforcement learning (RL) is used to develop a
   closed-loop anesthesia controller using the bispectral index (BIS) as a
   control variable while concurrently accounting for mean arterial
   pressure (MAP). In particular, the proposed framework uses these two
   parameters to control propofol infusion rates to regulate the BIS and
   MAP within a desired range. Specifically, a weighted combination of the
   error of the BIS and MAP signals is considered in the proposed RL
   algorithm. This reduces the computational complexity of the RL algorithm
   and consequently the controller processing time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Purpose: Cardiac ultrasound simulation can have important applications
   in the design of ultrasound systems, understanding the interaction
   effect between ultrasound and tissue and setting the ground truth for
   validating quantification methods. Current ultrasound simulation methods
   fail to simulate the myocardial intensity anisotropies. New simulation
   methods are needed in order to simulate realistic ultrasound images of
   the heart.
   Methods: The proposed cardiac ultrasound image simulation method is
   based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of the heart. The method
   utilizes both the cardiac geometry and the fiber orientation information
   to simulate the anisotropic intensities in B-mode ultrasound images.
   Before the simulation procedure, the geometry and fiber orientations of
   the heart are obtained from high-resolution structural MRI and DTI data,
   respectively. The simulation includes two important steps. First, the
   backscatter coefficients of the point scatterers inside the myocardium
   are processed according to the fiber orientations using an anisotropic
   model. Second, the cardiac ultrasound images are simulated with
   anisotropic myocardial intensities. The proposed method was also
   compared with two other nonanisotropic intensity methods using 50 B-mode
   ultrasound image volumes of five different rat hearts. The simulated
   images were also compared with the ultrasound images of a diseased rat
   heart in vivo. A new segmental evaluation method is proposed to validate
   the simulation results. The average relative errors (AREs) of five
   parameters, i.e., mean intensity, Rayleigh distribution parameter s, and
   first, second, and third quartiles, were utilized as the evaluation
   metrics. The simulated images were quantitatively compared with real
   ultrasound images in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments.
   Results: The proposed ultrasound image simulation method can
   realistically simulate cardiac ultrasound images of the heart using
   high-resolution MR-DTI data. The AREs of their proposed method are 19\%
   for the mean intensity, 17.7\% for the scale parameter of Rayleigh
   distribution, 36.8\% for the first quartile of the image intensities,
   25.2\% for the second quartile, and 19.9\% for the third quartile. In
   contrast, the errors of the other two methods are generally five times
   more than those of their proposed method.
   Conclusions: The proposed simulation method uses MR-DTI data and
   realistically generates cardiac ultrasound images with anisotropic
   intensities inside the myocardium. The ultrasound simulation method
   could provide a tool for many potential research and clinical
   applications in cardiac ultrasound imaging. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Integrating accurate air quality modeling with decision making is
   hampered by complex atmospheric physics and chemistry and its coupling
   with atmospheric transport. Existing approaches to model the physics and
   chemistry accurately lead to significant computational burdens in
   computing the response of atmospheric concentrations to changes in
   emissions profiles. By integrating a reduced form of a fully coupled
   atmospheric model within a unit commitment optimization model, we allow,
   for the first time to our knowledge, a fully dynamical approach toward
   electricity planning that accurately and rapidly minimizes both cost and
   health impacts. The reduced-form model captures the response of
   spatially resolved air pollutant concentrations to changes in
   electricity-generating plant emissions on an hourly basis with accuracy
   comparable to a comprehensive air quality model. The integrated model
   allows for the inclusion of human health impacts into cost-based
   decisions for power plant operation. We use the new capability in a case
   study of the state of Georgia over the years of 2004-2011, and show that
   a shift in utilization among existing power plants during selected
   hourly periods could have provided a health cost savings of \$175.9
   million dollars for an additional electricity generation cost of \$83.6
   million in 2007 US dollars (USD2007). The case study illustrates how air
   pollutant health impacts can be cost-effectively minimized by
   intelligently modulating power plant operations over multihour periods,
   without implementing additional emissions control technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades, many multicolumn chromatographic processes have
   been proposed and studied for multicomponent continuous separation. In
   this study, the optimal operation for ternary multicolumn
   chromatographic separation is obtained from a full superstructure which
   embeds many different operations. A multiobjective optimization problem
   was solved to analyze the trade-off between the throughput and the
   purity of the target component. It was found that the throughput of the

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Recently, visible light communication (VLC) has attracted much attention
   as a possible candidate technology to meet the ever growing demand in
   wireless data. However, current low-cost white LED has limited
   modulation bandwidth, which limits the throughput of the VLC. Optical
   MIMO can provide spatial diversity and thus achieve high data rate.
   Traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques used in
   wireless communications cannot be directly applied to VLC. This paper
   studies the precoder and equalizer design of optical wireless MIMO
   system for VLC. First, we propose a MIMO VLC system, which can
   effectively support the flickering/dimming control and other
   VLC-specific requirements. Second, besides the transceiver design with
   perfect channel state information, we also take into account channel
   uncertainties for joint optimization in the MIMO VLC system. Numerical
   results show that the proposed MIMO solution for VLC is robust to combat
   the influence caused by the channel estimation imperfection. By taking
   into account the channel estimation errors, the proposed joint
   optimization method demonstrates the bit error rate (BER) improvements
   in the scenario of imperfect channel estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic processing and accurate diagnosis of pathological
   electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains a challenge. As long-term ECG
   recordings continue to increase in prevalence, driven partly by the ease
   of remote monitoring technology usage, the need to automate ECG analysis
   continues to grow. In previous studies, a model-based ECG filtering
   approach to ECG data from healthy subjects has been applied to
   facilitate accurate online filtering and analysis of physiological
   signals. We propose an extension of this approach, which models not only
   normal and ventricular heartbeats, but also morphologies not previously
   encountered. A switching Kalman filter approach is introduced to enable
   the automatic selection of the most likely mode (beat type), while
   simultaneously filtering the signal using appropriate prior knowledge.
   Novelty detection is also made possible by incorporating a third mode
   for the detection of unknown (not previously observed) morphologies, and
   denoted asX-factor. This new approach is compared to state-of-the-art
   techniques for the ventricular heartbeat classification in theMIT-BIH
   arrhythmia and Incart databases. F-1 scores of 98.3\% and 99.5\% were
   found on each database, respectively, which are superior to other
   published algorithms' results reported on the same databases. Only 3\%
   of all the beats were discarded as X-factor, and the majority of these
   beats contained high levels of noise. The proposed technique
   demonstrates accurate beat classification in the presence of previously
   unseen (and unlearned) morphologies and noise, and provides an automated
   method for morphological analysis of arbitrary (unknown) ECG leads.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based optimization methods are a class of stochastic search
   methods that iteratively find candidate solutions by generating samples
   from a parameterized probabilistic model on the solution space. In order
   to better capture the multi-modality of the objective functions than the
   traditional model-based methods which use only a single model, we
   propose a framework of using a population of models at every iteration
   with an adaptive mechanism to propagate the population over iterations.
   The adaptive mechanism is derived from estimating the optimal parameter
   of the probabilistic model in a Bayesian manner, and thus provides a
   proper way to determine the diversity in the population of the models.
   We provide theoretical justification on the convergence of this
   framework by showing that the posterior distribution of the parameter
   asymptotically converges to a degenerate distribution concentrating on
   the optimal parameter. Under this framework, we develop two practical
   algorithms by incorporating sequential Monte Carlo methods, and carry
   out numerical experiments to illustrate their performance.}},

Abstract = {{The safety of buildings which have been affected by a natural disaster
   such as an earthquake is currently evaluated manually by certified
   inspectors who identify visible damage on the structural elements. This
   process has been proven to be time-consuming, costly, and can delay the
   response and recovery. In order to automate this type of assessment, it
   is necessary to automatically determine the damage state of the
   individual structural members. Previously, the writers have created
   novel methods for automated detection of RC columns as well as
   significant damage on the column surfaces (spalling and cracking). This
   paper presents a novel method of automatically determining the damage
   state of RC columns in RC frame buildings based only on the
   automatically detected damage and column information. In addition, the
   novel method automatically determines an associated engineering demand
   parameter, residual drift capacity. All of the methods previously
   developed by the writers are combined with the method presented in this
   paper and the results are compared with those of manual assessment
   procedures. The method was implemented using computer software and its
   effectiveness was confirmed with this comparison. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant climate
   phenomenon affecting extreme weather conditions worldwide. Its response
   to greenhouse warming has challenged scientists for decades, despite
   model agreement on projected changes in mean state. Recent studies have
   provided new insights into the elusive links between changes in ENSO and
   in the mean state of the Pacific climate. The projected slow-down in
   Walker circulation is expected to weaken equatorial Pacific Ocean
   currents, boosting the occurrences of eastward-propagating warm surface
   anomalies that characterize observed extreme El Nino events. Accelerated
   equatorial Pacific warming, particularly in the east, is expected to
   induce extreme rainfall in the eastern equatorial Pacific and extreme
   equatorward swings of the Pacific convergence zones, both of which are
   features of extreme El Nino. The frequency of extreme La Nina is also
   expected to increase in response to more extreme El Ninos, an
   accelerated maritime continent warming and surface-intensified ocean
   warming. ENSO-related catastrophic weather events are thus likely to
   occur more frequently with unabated greenhouse-gas emissions. But model
   biases and recent observed strengthening of the Walker circulation
   highlight the need for further testing as new models, observations and
   insights become available.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an iterative process-material analysis approach,
   to predict the evolution of grain size on the surface of a workpiece
   material, resulting from the mechanical and thermal loading effects
   during the machining process. The proposed approach endeavors to
   describe the effects, the resulting changes of the workpiece properties
   have on the process behaviors. The retroactive mechanism, in the context
   of how process behaviors are affected by material-microstructural
   variations, is jointly considered, while both mechanisms of grain
   refinement, as a result of dynamic recrystallization and grain growth
   due to thermal energy, are incorporated in the analysis of the final
   grain size. The dynamic recrystallization process is described by a
   Zener-Hollomon-based model. Furthermore, the thermal energy dissipation
   effect is quantified by a thermally activated cross-slip mechanism
   contributing to the increase of grain size. Subsequently, the outputs of
   these process mechanics, such as the strain, strain rate, and
   temperature, are calculated, and the microstructure behavior is
   predicted in response to the material properties and machining
   parameters. The experimental validations of the proposed approach are
   accomplished on two aluminum systems, AA7075 and AA 6061.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the modeling of material phase transformation in grinding
   processes by examining strain rate and contact zone temperature to
   quantitatively link to the kinetics of diffusion-controlled as well as
   diffusionless transformations is presented. Based upon the addition of
   volume fractions in sequential segmented isothermal processes
   characteristic to grindings, physics-based modeling and prediction for
   the volume fraction of phase transformation in continuous heating under
   anisothermal conditions are developed. In validation of the predictive
   model, a series of maraging steel 250 grinding experiments, XRD
   measurements, and regression analyses were pursued. The comparison of
   experimental resulting data and the model prediction of volume fraction
   of austenite, martensite, and ferrite phases after grinding have been
   done. It is seen that the physics-based model presents the
   practicability to predict the incidence and extent of phase
   transformation as related to material properties, wheel characteristics,
   and grinding thermal-mechanical loadings.}},

Abstract = {{Although petroleum hydrocarbons discharged from the Deepwater Horizon
   (DWH) blowout were shown to have a pronounced impact on indigenous
   microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico, effects on nearshore or
   coastal ecosystems remain understudied. This study investigated the
   successional patterns of functional and taxonomic diversity for over 1
   year after the DWH oil was deposited on Pensacola Beach sands (FL, USA),
   using metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon techniques. Gamma-and
   Alphaproteobacteria were enriched in oiled sediments, in corroboration
   of previous studies. In contrast to previous studies, we observed an
   increase in the functional diversity of the community in response to oil
   contamination and a functional transition from generalist populations
   within 4 months after oil came ashore to specialists a year later, when
   oil was undetectable. At the latter time point, a typical beach
   community had reestablished that showed little to no evidence of oil
   hydrocarbon degradation potential, was enriched in archaeal taxa known
   to be sensitive to xenobiotics, but differed significantly from the
   community before the oil spill. Further, a clear succession pattern was
   observed, where early responders to oil contamination, likely degrading
   aliphatic hydrocarbons, were replaced after 3 months by populations
   capable of aromatic hydrocarbon decomposition. Collectively, our results
   advance the understanding of how natural benthic microbial communities
   respond to crude oil perturbation, supporting the
   specialization-disturbance hypothesis; that is, the expectation that
   disturbance favors generalists, while providing (microbial) indicator
   species and genes for the chemical evolution of oil hydrocarbons during
   degradation and weathering.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Two separate large eddy simulations (LES) are carried out to investigate
   the effects of accurate computation of the curvilinear water-surface
   deformation of the flow through a bridge contraction. One LES employs
   the rigid-lid boundary condition at the water surface, while the other
   uses a highly accurate level-set method (LSM), which allows the water
   surface to adjust itself freely in response to the flow. The simulation
   with the LSM is validated with data from complementary physical model
   tests under analogous geometrical and flow conditions. Streamwise
   velocity, bed-shear stress and second-order turbulence statistics
   obtained from both simulations are compared, and it is shown that the
   turbulence structure of this flow is influenced strongly by the
   water-surface deformation. While bed-shear stresses and first-order
   statistics are very similar for both cases, the instantaneous turbulence
   structure and consequently, the second-order statistics, are distinctly
   different. The correct prediction of the water-surface deformation of
   such flows is deemed important for the accuracy of their simulation. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{87-93}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This review article summarizes the alternative use of adsorbent
   materials for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters. Pharmaceutical
   wastewaters are very hazardous and toxic not only for the human but also
   for environmental life. The existence of various drug pollutants in such
   effluents surcharges the aqueous media. Therefore, apart from the
   proposed conventional (until now) methods applied (biodegradation,
   photocatalysis, ozonation, Fenton process, etc.), the applicability of
   adsorption as simple and low-cost technique is recently applied. Some of
   the most important materials discussed in this work are clays, polymers
   (chitosan), zeolites, various types of(activated) carbons, composite
   materials (graphene-based), agricultural wastes or soils. The key-factor
   about the selection of the most suitable adsorbent material has resulted
   after adsorption experiments varying some major parameters (pH, contact
   time, initial pharmaceutical compound concentration, ionic strength,
   etc.). However, the most crucial factor is the adsorption capacity. So,
   some isotherm models are also commented here (Langmuir, Freundlich,
   Sips), which predict the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity (Q(m))
   of each material used. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic synthesis of single cell oils (SCOs) for biodiesel application
   by heterotrophic oleaginous microorganisms is being hampered by the high
   cost of culture media. This study investigated the possibility of using
   loblolly pine and sweetgum autohydrolysates as economic feedstocks for
   microbial lipid production by oleaginous Rhodococcus opacus (R. opacus)
   PD630 and DSM 1069. Results revealed that when the substrates were
   detoxified by the removal of inhibitors (such as
   HMF-hydroxymethyl-furfural), the two strains exhibited viable growth
   patterns after a short adaptation/lag phase. R. opacus PD630 accumulated
   as much as 28.6 \% of its cell dry weight (CDW) in lipids while growing
   on detoxified sweetgum autohydrolysate (DSAH) that translates to 0.25
   g/l lipid yield. The accumulation of SCOs reached the level of
   oleagenicity in DSM 1069 cells (28.3 \% of CDW) as well, while being
   cultured on detoxified pine autohydrolysate (DPAH), with the maximum
   lipid yield of 0.31 g/l. The composition of the obtained microbial oils
   varied depending on the substrates provided. These results indicate that
   lignocellulosic autohydrolysates can be used as low-cost fermentation
   substrates for microbial lipid production by wild-type R. opacus
   species. Consequently, the variety of applications for aqueous liquors
   from lignocellulosic pretreatment has been expanded, allowing for the
   further optimization of the integrated biorefinery.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry
   infills is assessed through numerical simulations considering
   uncertainty in ground motion and building materials. To achieve this
   aim, a numerical model of the components is developed, a rational
   approach to proportion and locate individual struts in the equivalent
   three-strut model is proposed, and an explicit nonlinear column shear
   response model accounting for the infill-column interaction and
   soft-story mechanism is employed. The proposed numerical model is used
   to (1) generate probabilistic seismic demand models accounting for a
   wide range of ground motion intensities with different frequency content
   and (2) determine limit state models obtained from nonlinear pushover
   analysis and incremental dynamic analysis. Using the demand and limit
   state model, fragility curves for the masonry-infilled frames are
   developed to investigate the impact of various infill properties on the
   frame vulnerability. It is observed that the beneficial effect of the
   masonry infill diminishes at more severe limit states because of the
   interaction with the boundary frame. In some cases, this effect almost
   vanishes or switches to an adverse effect beyond a threshold of ground
   motion intensities. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is increasingly becoming popular
   for multi-MW drive systems. One of the main technical challenges
   associated with the operation of MMC for adjustable-speed drives is the
   large magnitude of submodule (SM) capacitor voltage ripple under
   constant-torque low-speed operation. This paper proposes two new control
   strategies to reduce the magnitude of the SM capacitor voltage ripple in
   the MMC-based adjustable-speed drive systems under constant-torque
   low-speed operation. The proposed control strategies are based on
   injecting a square-wave common-mode voltage at the ac-side and a
   circulating current within the phase-legs to attenuate the low-frequency
   components of the SM capacitor voltages. The frequency spectrum of the
   injected circulating current consists of components in the vicinity of
   either the common-mode frequency or the common-mode frequency and third
   harmonic of the common-mode frequency. This paper also provides: i) a
   theoretical comparison of the proposed control strategies with the
   existing ones; ii) a controller design methodology to systematically
   determine the controller gains of the proposed control strategies; and
   iii) a theoretical proof of stability of the proposed control strategies
   and their design methodology based on Lyapunov analysis of singularly
   perturbed nonlinear non-autonomous systems. A set of experimental
   results for various case studies on a laboratory-scale prototype are
   provided to support the theoretical proof of stability of the proposed
   control strategies and their design methodology, and to show the
   superior performance of the proposed strategies over the existing
   strategy.}},

Title = {{A quasistatic implementation of the concurrent atomistic-continuum
   method for FCC crystals}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{91-126}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, numerous partitioned-domain methods have been developed
   to describe dislocation behavior at length scales that are usually
   inaccessible to most classical atomistic methods. These methods retain
   full atomistic detail in regions of interest while using a continuum
   description to reduce the computational burden elsewhere. In most of
   these methods, however, lattice defects in the continuum are either
   implemented via constitutive relations, lattice elasticity with
   dislocation field interactions, or are not permitted at all. In such
   approaches, the transit of dislocations across the atomistic/continuum
   interface appeals to approximate heuristics intended to minimize the
   effects of the interface due to the change from atomistic to continuum
   degrees of freedom. The concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) method,
   originally developed for addressing dynamic dislocation behavior by
   Xiong et al. (2011), permits dislocations to propagate in a continuum
   domain that employs a piecewise continuous finite element description
   with interelement displacement discontinuities. The method avoids ghost
   forces at interfate between atomistically resolved and coarse-grained
   domains. CAC has subsequently been used to investigate complex
   dislocation behavior in face-centered cubic (FCC) metals (Xiong et al.,
   2012b,a,c, 2015). In this paper, we propose a quasistatic 3-D method to
   carry out sequential energy-minimized simulations at 0 K. This
   facilitates study of structure evolution along minimum energy pathways,
   avoiding over-driven conditions of high rate molecular dynamics.
   Parallelization steps in code implementation are described. Applications
   are presented for the quasistatic CAC method in FCC metal plasticity.
   Comparisons are made with a fully-resolved atomistic method for
   generalized stacking fault energy, core structure and stress field of a
   single 60 mixed type dislocation, surface indentation, and 60 mixed type
   dislocation migration through the interface between atomistic and
   coarse-grained domains. It is shown that 3-D CAC simulations are useful
   in substantially reducing the number of degrees of freedom while
   preserving key characteristics of dislocation structure, stacking
   faults, and plasticity, including the net Burgers vector and long range
   fields of interacting dislocations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Symmetry reduction of turbulent pipe flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{779}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We propose and apply a Fourier-based symmetry-reduction scheme to
   remove, or quotient, the streamwise translation symmetry of
   laser-induced-fluorescence measurements of turbulent pipe flows that are
   viewed as dynamical systems in a high dimensional state space. We also
   explain the relation between Taylor's hypothesis and the comoving frame
   velocity U-d of the turbulent orbit in state space. In particular, in
   physical space we observe flow structures that deform as they advect
   downstream at a speed that differs significantly from U-d. Indeed, the
   symmetry-reduction analysis of planar dye concentration fields at
   Reynolds number Re = 3200 reveals that the speed u at which high
   concentration peaks advect is roughly 1.43 times U-d. In a physically
   meaningful symmetry-reduced frame, the excess speed u - U-d approximate
   to 0.43U(d) can be explained in terms of the so-called geometric phase
   velocity U-g associated with the orbit in state space. The
   `self-propulsion velocity' U-g is induced by the shape-changing dynamics
   of passive scalar structures observed in the symmetry reduced frame, in
   analogy with that of a swimmer at low Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, research on carbon nanotubes has revealed
   potential advances in thermal engineering applications. The present
   study investigates the radiative absorption and reflection of vertically
   aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) in the broad spectrum from the
   near-infrared to far-infrared regions. The optical constants of VACNT
   are modeled based on the dielectric function of graphite and an
   effective medium approach that treats the CNT film as a homogenized
   medium. Calculated radiative properties show characteristics of
   near-unity index matching and high absorptance up to around 20 mu m
   wavelength. The packing density and degree of alignment are shown to
   affect the predicted radiative properties. The Brewster angle and
   penetration depth of VACNTs are examined in the infrared spectrum. The
   radiative properties for VACNT thin films are also evaluated, showing
   some reduction of absorptance in the near-infrared due to transmission
   for film thicknesses less than 50 mu m. This study provides a better
   understanding of the infrared behavior of VACNT and may guide the design
   for its applications in energy harvesting, space-borne detectors, and

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel full-field approach based on the fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) technique to compute mechanical fields in
   periodic discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations for anisotropic
   materials: the DDD-FFT approach. By coupling the FFT-based approach to
   the discrete continuous model, the present approach benefits from the
   high computational efficiency of the FFT algorithm, while allowing for a
   discrete representation of dislocation lines. It is demonstrated that
   the computational time associated with the new DDD-FFT approach is
   significantly lower than that of current DDD approaches when large
   number of dislocation segments are involved for isotropic and
   anisotropic elasticity, respectively. Furthermore, for fine Fourier
   grids, the treatment of anisotropic elasticity comes at a similar
   computational cost to that of isotropic simulation. Thus, the proposed
   approach paves the way towards achieving scale transition from DDD to
   mesoscale plasticity, especially due to the method's ability to
   incorporate inhomogeneous elasticity.}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The yield and work hardening behavior of a small-scale initial-boundary
   value problem involving dislocation plasticity in an idealized particle
   strengthened system is investigated using micropolar single crystal
   plasticity and is compared with results for the same problem from
   dislocation dynamics simulations. A micropolar single crystal is a
   work-conjugate higher-order continuum that treats the lattice rotations
   as generalized displacements, and supports couple stresses that are
   work-conjugate to the lattice torsion-curvature, leading to a
   non-symmetric Cauchy stress. The resolved skewsymmetric component of the
   Cauchy stress tensor results in slip system level kinematic hardening
   during heterogeneous deformation that depends on gradients of lattice
   torsion-curvature. The scale-dependent mechanical response of the
   micropolar single crystal is dictated both by energetic (higher-order
   elastic constants) and dissipative (plastic torsion-curvature) intrinsic
   material length scales. We show that the micropolar model captures
   essential details of the average stress-strain behavior predicted by
   discrete dislocation dynamics and of the cumulative slip and dislocation
   density fields predicted by statistical dislocation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2D single-atomic layer
   graphene have superior thermal, electrical, andmechanical properties.
   However, these nanomaterials exhibit poor out-of-plane properties due to
   theweak van der Waals interaction in the transverse direction between
   graphitic layers. Recent theoretical studies indicate that rationally
   designed 3D architectures could have desirable out- of-plane
   propertieswhilemaintaining in-plane properties by growing CNTs and
   graphene into 3D architectures with a seamless nodal junction. However,
   the experimental realization of seamlessly-bonded architectures remains
   a challenge. We developed a strategy of creating 3D graphene-CNT hollow
   fibers with radially aligned CNTs (RACNTs) seamlessly sheathed by a
   cylindrical graphene layer through a one-step chemical vapor deposition
   using an anodized aluminum wire template. By controlling the aluminum
   wire diameter and anodization time, the length of the RACNTs and
   diameter of the graphene hollow fiber can be tuned, enabling efficient
   energy conversion and storage. These fibers, with a controllable surface
   area, meso-/micropores, and superior electrical properties, are
   excellent electrode materials for all-solid-state wire-shaped
   supercapacitors with poly (vinylalcohol)/H2SO4 as the electrolyte and
   binder, exhibiting a surface-specific capacitance of 89.4mF/cm(2) and
   length-specific capacitance up to 23.9mF/cm, - one to four times the
   corresponding record-high capacities reported for other fiber-like
   supercapacitors. Dye-sensitized solar cells, fabricated using the fiber
   as a counter electrode, showed a power conversion efficiency of 6.8\%
   and outperformed their counterparts with an expensive Pt wire counter
   electrode by a factor of 2.5. These novel fiber-shaped graphene-RACNT
   energy conversion and storage devices are so flexible they can be woven
   into fabrics as power sources.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death worldwide.
   Notch1 signaling plays a critical role in cardiac development, in
   survival, cardiogenic lineage commitment, differentiation of cardiac
   stem/progenitor cells, and in regenerative responses following
   myocardial injury. The objective of this study was the evaluation of the
   therapeutic effect of delivering the Notch ligand-containing hydrogels
   in a rat model of MI. Self-assembling peptide (SAP) hydrogels were
   functionalized with a peptide mimic of the Notch1 ligand Jagged1 (RJ).
   In rats subjected to experimental MI, delivery of RJ-containing hydrogel
   to the infarcted heart resulted in improvement in cardiac function back
   to sham-operated levels. A significant decrease in fibrosis and an
   increase in the endothelial vessel area and Ki67 expression were also
   observed in rats treated with the RJ hydrogels compared to untreated
   rats or rats treated with unmodified or scrambled peptide hydrogels.
   This study demonstrates the functional benefit of Notch1-activating
   peptide delivered in SAP hydrogels for cardiac repair.}},

Abstract = {{Local anesthesia in the skin occurs approximately 1 h after application
   of a commercial topical formulation of lidocaine and prilocaine prepared
   as a eutectic mixture. A number of lidocaine salts was screened and
   lidocaine-ibuprofen was found to form a room-temperature ionic liquid.
   When applied to the skin of rats, local anesthesia of skin was achieved
   within 10-20 min in the rats' paws and tails with no apparent adverse
   effects to the skin as determined by histological analysis. We believe
   that the lidocaine-ibuprofen ionic liquid increased lidocaine absorption
   into the skin due to the high lidocaine concentration in the ionic
   liquid and due to possible interactions between the ionic liquid and the
   skin to increase skin permeability. These findings suggest that
   lidocaine-ibuprofen ionic liquid may provide a more rapid method of drug
   delivery to the skin for local anesthesia. (c) 2015 American Institute

   Defects Compared With Autograft}},

Abstract = {{Background Autologous bone grafting remains the gold standard in the
   treatment of large bone defects but is limited by tissue availability
   and donor site morbidity. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2
   (rhBMP-2), delivered with a collagen sponge, is clinically used to treat
   large bone defects and complications such as delayed healing or
   nonunion. For the same dose of rhBMP-2, we have shown that a hybrid
   nanofiber mesh-alginate (NMA-rhBMP-2) delivery system provides
   longer-term release and increases functional bone regeneration in
   critically sized rat femoral bone defects compared with a collagen
   sponge. However, no comparisons of healing efficiencies have been made
   thus far between this hybrid delivery system and the gold standard of
   using autograft.
   Questions/purposes We compared the efficacy of the NMA-rhBMP-2 hybrid
   delivery system to morselized autograft and hypothesized that the
   functional regeneration of large bone defects observed with sustained
   BMP delivery would be at least comparable to autograft treatment as
   measured by total bone volume and ex vivo mechanical properties.
   Methods Bilateral critically sized femoral bone defects in rats were
   treated with either live autograft or with the NMA-rhBMP-2 hybrid
   delivery system such that each animal received one treatment per leg.
   Healing was monitored by radiography and histology at 2, 4, 8, and 12
   weeks. Defects were evaluated for bone formation by longitudinal
   micro-CT scans over 12 weeks (n = 14 per group). The bone volume, bone
   density, and the total new bone formed beyond 2 weeks within the defect
   were calculated from micro-CT reconstructions and values compared for
   the 2-, 4-, 8-, and 12-week scans within and across the two treatment
   groups. Two animals were used for bone labeling with subcutaneously
   injected dyes at 4, 8, and 12 weeks followed by histology at 12 weeks to
   identify incremental new bone formation. Functional recovery was
   measured by ex vivo biomechanical testing (n = 9 per group). Maximum
   torque and torsional stiffness calculated from torsion testing of the
   femurs at 12 weeks were compared between the two groups.
   Results The NMA-rhBMP-2 hybrid delivery system resulted in greater bone
   formation and improved biomechanical properties compared with autograft
   at 12 weeks. Comparing new bone volume within each group, the
   NMA-rhBMP-2-treated group had higher volume (p < 0.001) at 12 weeks
   (72.59 +/- 18.34 mm(3)) compared with 8 weeks (54.90 +/- 16.14) and 4
   weeks (14.22 +/- 9.59). The new bone volume was also higher at 8 weeks
   compared with 4 weeks (p < 0.001). The autograft group showed higher (p
   < 0.05) new bone volume at 8 weeks (11.19 +/- 8.59 mm(3)) and 12 weeks
   (14.64 +/- 10.36) compared with 4 weeks (5.15 +/- 4.90). Between groups,
   the NMA-rhBMP-2-treated group had higher (p < 0.001) new bone volume
   than the autograft group at both 8 and 12 weeks. Local mineralized
   matrix density in the NMA-rhBMP-2-treated group was lower than that of
   the autograft group at all time points (p < 0.001). Presence of nuclei
   within the lacunae of the autograft and early appositional bone
   formation seen in representative histology sections suggested that the
   bone grafts remained viable and were functionally engrafted within the
   defect. The bone label distribution from representative sections also
   revealed more diffuse mineralization in the defect in the
   NMA-rhBMP-2-treated group, whereas more localized distribution of new
   mineral was seen at the edges of the graft pieces in the autograft
   group. The NMA-rhBMP-2-treated group also revealed higher torsional
   stiffness (0.042 +/- 0.019 versus 0.020 +/- 0.022 N-m/degrees; p =
   0.037) and higher maximum torque (0.270 +/- 0.108 versus 0.125 +/- 0.137
   N-m; p = 0.024) compared with autograft.
   Conclusions The NMA-rhBMP-2 hybrid delivery system improved bone
   formation and restoration of biomechanical function of rat segmental
   bone defects compared with autograft treatment.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the following differential game of pursuit and evasion
   involving two participating players: an evader, which has limited
   maneuverability, and an agile pursuer. The agents move on the Euclidean
   plane with different but constant speeds. Whereas the pursuer can change
   the orientation of its velocity vector arbitrarily fast, that is, he is
   a ``pedestrian{''} a la Isaacs, the evader cannot make turns having a
   radius smaller than a specified minimum turning radius. This problem can
   be seen as a reversed Homicidal Chauffeur game, hence the name
   ``Suicidal Pedestrian Differential Game.{''} The aim of this paper is to
   derive the optimal strategies of the two players and characterize the
   initial conditions that lead to capture if the pursuer acts optimally,
   and areas that guarantee evasion regardless of the pursuer's strategy.
   Both proximity-capture and point-capture are considered. After applying
   the optimal strategy for the evader, it is shown that the case of
   point-capture reduces to a special version of Zermelo's Navigation
   Problem (ZNP) for the pursuer. Therefore, the well-known ZNP solution
   can be used to validate the results obtained through the differential
   game framework, as well as to characterize the time-optimal
   trajectories. The results are directly applicable to collision avoidance
   in maritime and Air Traffic Control applications.}},

Abstract = {{A wirelessly powered homecage system, called the EnerCage-HC, that is
   equipped with multicoil wireless power transfer, closed-loop power
   control, optical behavioral tracking, and a graphic user interface is
   presented for longitudinal electrophysiology and behavioral neuroscience
   experiments. The EnerCage-HC system can wirelessly power a mobile unit
   attached to a small animal subject and also track its behavior in
   real-time as it is housed inside a standard homecage. The EnerCage-HC
   system is equipped with one central and four overlapping slanted
   wire-wound coils with optimal geometries to form three-and four-coil
   power transmission links while operating at 13.56 MHz. Utilizing
   multicoil links increases the power transfer efficiency (PTE) compared
   with conventional two-coil links and also reduces the number of power
   amplifiers to only one, which significantly reduces the system
   complexity, cost, and heat dissipation. A Microsoft Kinect installed 90
   cm above the homecage localizes the animal position and orientation with
   1.6-cm accuracy. Moreover, a power management ASIC, including a high
   efficiency active rectifier and automatic coil resonance tuning, was
   fabricated in a 0.35-mu m 4M2P standard CMOS process for the mobile
   unit. The EnerCage-HC achieves a max/min PTE of 36.3\%/16.1\% at the
   nominal height of 7 cm. In vivo experiments were conducted on freely
   behaving rats by continuously delivering 24 mW to the mobile unit for >
   7 h inside a standard homecage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents, for the first time, the analysis, design,
   fabrication, and characterization of a microhemispherical resonating
   gyroscope (mu HRG). A 3D high aspect-ratio poly- and single-crystalline
   silicon (HARPSS) process is developed to fabricate a stem-supported
   hemispherical shell with self-aligned tall capacitive electrodes
   intended for driving, sensing, and tuning of the gyroscope. The
   monolithic process consists of seven lithographic steps combining the
   HARPSS process with fabrication of a 3D curved microstructure to create
   electrodes with scalable capacitive gaps. The fabrication is
   successfully demonstrated with polysilicon mu HRG prototypes with a
   diameter of 1.2 mm and a shell thickness of 1 mu m. The frequency
   response is measured and gyro operation is examined using the integrated
   electrodes. Mode matching and mode alignment are successfully performed
   by applying tuning and quadrature nulling voltages. A closed-loop rate
   sensitivity scale factor of 8.57 mV/degrees/s was measured. Furthermore,
   design and process optimization of the support structure resulted in an
   improved quality factor (Q similar to 40 000).}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An asymptotic theory of composite plates is constructed using the
   variational asymptotic method. To maximize simplicity and promote
   efficiency of the developed model, a transrmation procedure is required
   to establish a mathematical link between an asymptotically correct
   energy functional derived herein and a simpler engineering model, such
   as a generalized Reissner Mindlin model. Without relaxing the warping
   constraints and peiforming ``smart minimization{''} or optimization
   procedures introduced in previous work a different approach is suggested
   in this paper. To eliminate all partial derivatives of the 2D
   generalized strains in the asymptotically correct energy functional, a
   hybrid transformation procedure is systematically carried out by
   involving modified equilibrium and compatibility equations, and solving
   a system of linear algebraic equations via the pseudo-inverse method.
   Equivalent constitutive laws for the generalized Reissner Mindlin plate
   model are then estimated. Several examples as a preliminary validation
   are used to demonstrate the capability and accuracy of this new model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we have employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   to computationally explore the effects of hydrostatic stress on the
   shear deformation behavior of nanocrystalline (NC) Cu, over a range of

   were deformed under shear with superimposed isotropic

   results suggest that the shear strength increases under imposed
   compressive `.()=, and decreases under imposed tensile, by around
   0.05-0.09 GPa for every GPa of imposed hydrostatic pressure. At 300K, we
   computed activation volumes (3.5-9 b3) and activation energies (0.2-0.3
   eV), with values agreeing with those reported in previous experimental
   and theoretical work, notwithstanding the extreme deformation rates
   imposed in MD simulations. Additionally, we observed that shear
   deformation under an imposed compressive hydrostatic stress tends to
   slightly increase both the activation volumes and the energy activation
   barrier. Finally, no discernible pressure effect could be observed on

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In a microelectronic device, thermal transport needs to be simulated on
   scales ranging from tens of nanometers to hundreds of millimeters. High
   accuracy multiscale models are required to develop engineering tools for
   predicting temperature distributions with sufficient accuracy in such
   devices. A computationally efficient and accurate multiscale reduced
   order transient thermal modeling methodology was developed using a
   combination of two different approaches: ``progressive zoom-in{''}
   method and ``proper orthogonal decomposition (POD){''} technique. The
   capability of this approach in handling several decades of length scales
   from ``package{''} to ``chip components{''} at a considerably lower
   computational cost, while maintaining satisfactory accuracy was
   demonstrated. A flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA) package was considered
   for demonstration. The transient temperature and heat fluxes calculated
   on the top and bottom walls of the embedded chip at the package level
   simulations are employed as dynamic boundary conditions for the chip
   level simulation. The chip is divided into ten function blocks. Randomly
   generated dynamic power sources are applied in each of these blocks. The
   temperature rise in the different layers of the chip calculated from the
   multiscale model is compared with a finite element (FE) model. The close
   agreement between two models confirms that the multiscale approach can
   predict temperature rise accurately for scenarios corresponding to
   different power sources in functional blocks, without performing
   detailed FE simulations, which significantly reduces computational
   effort.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management is an important aspect for any packaging technology
   incorporating high power devices. In this paper, we present an
   integrated microfluidic cooling solution for high power surface mount
   thin film resistors on liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. High
   power resistors are mounted on top of a 50.8 mu m (2 mil) LCP layer, a
   coolant can circulate, thanks to a micropump, inside a Duroid
   micromachined channel beneath the LCP layer in order to take away the
   generated heat. A thermal model is combined from existing thermal models
   in literature to predict the overall thermal resistance of the organic
   heat sink in the case of a moving coolant inside the microfluidic
   channel. Four sets of microfluidic channels with different thicknesses
   are fabricated and tested. Temperature measurements of resistors with
   different power ratings and sizes on top of these channels agree with
   the model predictions and the simulations in the case of static
   (non-moving) and dynamic (moving) distilled (DI) water. With this
   integrated solution, the case temperature of the 40W resistor, which is
   mounted on the 254 mu m (10 mil) microchannel, can be cooled down to 121
   degrees C at room temperature while the resistor is dissipating 23.2W of
   power; this resistor fails to operate beyond 13.3W in the absence of
   fluid circulation. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the best
   thermal cooling performance ever achieved on multilayer organic

Title = {{Mixed Array of Compliant Interconnects to Balance Mechanical and
   Electrical Characteristics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Various designs of compliant interconnects are being pursued in
   universities and industry to accommodate the coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) mismatch between die and substrate or substrate and
   board. Although such interconnects are able to mechanically decouple the
   components, electrical parasitics of compliant interconnects are often
   high compared to the electrical parasitics of solder bump or solder ball
   interconnects. This increase in electrical parasitics is due to the fact
   that compliant interconnects typically having longer path lengths and
   smaller cross-sectional areas to provide compliance, which in turn,
   increases their electrical parasitics. In this paper, we present a mixed
   array of compliant interconnects as a tradeoff between mechanical
   compliance and electrical parasitics. In the proposed implementation,
   the die area is subdivided into three regions where high compliance,
   medium-compliance, and low-compliance interconnect variants are situated
   in the outer, middle, and inner regions of the die, respectively. By
   introducing the low-compliance variants into the assembly, interconnects
   with greatly reduced electrical parasitics can be used as power/ground
   interconnects, while the high-compliance interconnects, situated near
   the die edges, can be used as signal interconnects. This paper
   demonstrates the implementation of this configuration and also presents
   the experimental characterization of such heterogeneous array of
   interconnects.}},

   Sn-Ag-Cu Lead-Free Solders Incorporating Special Pileup Effects Using
   Nanoindentation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys are considered as good replacements of Sn-Pb
   alloys which are banned due to the toxic nature of Pb. But, SAC alloys
   have a coarse microstructure that consists of beta-Sn rich and eutectic
   phases. Nanoindentation is a useful technique to evaluate the mechanical
   properties at very small length scale. In this work, continuous
   stiffness measurement (CSM) nanoindentation setup (CSM Instruments SA,
   Peseux, Switzerland) is used to determine the individual phase
   mechanical properties like Young's modulus and hardness at high
   temperatures. It is demonstrated that these properties are a function of
   temperature for both beta-Sn rich and eutectic phases. Loadings starting
   from 500 mu N up to 5000 mu N are used with 500 mu N steps and average
   values are presented for Young's modulus and hardness. The loading rates
   applied are twice that of the loadings. High temperatures result in a
   higher creep deformation and therefore, to avoid it, different dwell
   times are used at peak loads. The special pileup effect, which is more
   significant at elevated temperatures, is determined and incorporated
   into the results. A better agreement is found with the previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase EC 1.10.3.2) belong to the
   family of multicopper oxidases. These environmentally friendly enzymes
   require O-2 as their only co-substrate and produce H2O as their sole
   by-product. As a result, they have acquired increasing use in
   biotechnological applications, particularly in the field of organic
   synthesis. In the current study, laccases have been employed to
   successfully couple 1,2-ethanedithiol to various substituted
   hydroquinones to produce novel 2,3-ethylenedithio-1,4-quinones in good
   yields via an oxidation-addition-oxidation-addition-oxidation mechanism.
   The reactions proceeded in one-pot under mild conditions (room
   temperature, pH 5.0). This study further supports the use of laccases as
   green tools in organic chemistry. Furthermore, it provides evidence that
   laccase-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving small thiols are
   possible, in spite of research that suggests small thiols are potent
   inhibitors of laccases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes additive manufacturing (AM) of IN100, a high
   gamma-prime nickel-based superalloy, through scanning laser epitaxy
   (SLE), aimed at the creation of thick deposits onto like-chemistry
   substrates for enabling repair of turbine engine hot-section components.
   SLE is a metal powder bed-based laser AM technology developed for
   nickel-base superalloys with equiaxed, directionally solidified, and
   single-crystal microstructural morphologies. Here, we combine process
   modeling, statistical design-of-experiments (DoE), and microstructural
   characterization to demonstrate fully metallurgically bonded, crack-free
   and dense deposits exceeding 1000 mu m of SLE-processed IN100 powder
   onto IN100 cast substrates produced in a single pass. A combined
   thermal-fluid flow-solidification model of the SLE process compliments
   DoE-based process development. A customized quantitative metallography
   technique analyzes digital cross-sectional micrographs and extracts
   various microstructural parameters, enabling process model validation
   and process parameter optimization. Microindentation measurements show
   an increase in the hardness by 10 pct in the deposit region compared to
   the cast substrate due to microstructural refinement. The results
   illustrate one of the very few successes reported for the crack-free
   deposition of IN100, a notoriously ``non-weldable{''} hot-section alloy,
   thus establishing the potential of SLE as an AM method suitable for
   hot-section component repair and for future new-make components in high
   gamma-prime containing crack-prone nickel-based superalloys.}},

Abstract = {{While overuse of the supraspinatus tendon is a leading factor in rotator
   cuff injury, the underlying biochemical changes have not been fully
   elucidated. In this study, torn human rotator cuff (supraspinatus)
   tendon tissue was analyzed for the presence of active cathepsin
   proteases with multiplex cysteine cathepsin zymography. In addition, an
   overuse injury to supraspinatus tendons was induced through downhill
   running in an established rat model. Histological analysis demonstrated
   that structural damage occurred by 8 weeks of overuse compared to
   control rats in the region of tendon insertion into bone. In both 4- and
   8-week overuse groups, via zymography, there was approximately a 180\%
   increase in cathepsin L activity at the insertion region compared to the
   controls, while no difference was found in the midsubstance area.
   Additionally, an over 400\% increase in cathepsin K activity was
   observed for the insertion region of the 4-week overused tendons. More
   cathepsin K and L immunostaining was observed at the insertion region of
   the overuse groups compared to controls. These results provide important
   information on a yet unexplored mechanism for tendon degeneration that
   may operate alone or in conjunction with other proteases to contribute
   to chronic tendinopathy.}},

Abstract = {{It is critical to evaluate an air quality model prior to regulatory
   applications to ensure model performance is adequate for regulatory
   decision making. However, no formal benchmarks currently exist in the
   United States (US) to judge whether a model's performance is acceptable
   for given purposes, and practitioners usually rely on criteria
   established in the past, when the extent of modeling domains and length
   of simulation periods were relatively limited. This study conducts
   modeling experiments to investigate the impact of using different
   modeling configurations on various policy-related modeling outcomes. Two
   widely used chemical transport models with different meteorological
   data, biogenic emissions, and aerosol modeling schemes are applied to an
   annual modeling period, and model performance for ozone and particulate
   matter (PM) constituents is evaluated for different timescales and
   geographical regions in the US. Results show that while both models can
   be considered acceptable based on criteria commonly used by modelers
   when evaluated on the annual basis, the model performance at finer
   levels can reveal differences between the two modeling configurations,
   which may lead to different policy outcomes. Model results for 2005 and
   2014 are used to determine monitoring sites projected to violate current
   US standards for ozone and fine PM, sites significantly affected by
   emissions from two selected upwind states, and ratios of deposition to
   ambient concentration of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, a.k.a.
   transference ratios, at each monitoring site in the eastern US. The two
   modeling configurations result in quite different lists of sites and
   transference ratios even though both show acceptable model performance
   in the conventional model performance evaluation. This calls for
   development of model performance evaluation criteria specific to various
   regulatory purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   wartime trauma, accidents, and tumor resections. Endogenous mechanisms
   of repair are often insufficient to ensure integration between host and
   donor bone and subsequent restoration of function. We investigated the
   role that bone marrow-derived cells play in bone regeneration and sought
   to increase their contributions by functionalizing bone allografts with
   bioactive lipid coatings. Polymer-coated allografts were used to locally
   deliver the immunomodulatory small molecule FTY720 in tibial defects
   created in rat bone marrow chimeras containing genetically-labeled bone
   marrow for monitoring cell origin and fate. Donor bone marrow
   contributed significantly to both myeloid and osteogenic cells in
   remodeling tissue surrounding allografts. FTY720 coatings altered the
   phenotype of immune cells two weeks post-injury, which was associated
   with increased vascularization and bone formation surrounding
   allografts. Consequently, degradable polymer coating strategies that
   deliver small molecule growth factors such as FTY720 represent a novel
   therapeutic strategy for harnessing endogenous bone marrow-derived
   progenitors and enhancing healing in load-bearing bone defects. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the following problem.
   Discrete partitioning problem (DPP). Let FqPn denote the n-dimensional
   finite projective space over F-q. For positive integer k <= n, let
   \{A(i)\}(i=1)(N) be a partition of (FqPn)(k) such that:
   (1) for all i <= N, A(i) = Pi(k)(j=1) A(j)(i) (partition into product
   sets),
   (2) for all i <= N, there is a (k - 1)-dimensional subspace L-i subset
   of FqPn such that A(i) subset of (L-i)(k).
   What is the minimum value of N as a function of q, n, k? We will be
   mainly interested in the case k = n.
   DPP arises in an approach that we propose for proving lower bounds for
   the query complexity of generating random points from convex bodies. It
   is also related to other partitioning problems in combinatorics and
   complexity theory. We conjecture an asymptotically optimal partition for
   DPP and show that it is optimal in two cases: when the dimension is low
   (k = n = 2) and when the factors of the parts are structured, namely
   factors of a part are close to being a subspace. These structured
   partitions arise naturally as partitions induced by query algorithms.
   Our problem does not seem to be directly amenable to previous techniques
   for partitioning lower bounds such as rank arguments, although rank
   arguments do lie at the core of our techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Life cycle assessments (LCA) of building materials often exclude the use
   phase due to variability in buildings and difficulties in isolating
   energy use for specific components of a building. For this study, a
   basic single-pane window was selected as a baseline to compare to two
   basic double-pane windows and four energy-efficient windows in a
   single-family home. Seventeen United States cities were investigated to
   represent 17 climate regions. Using energy simulations, along with life
   cycle inventory and economic data for windows, a cradle-to-grave LCA and
   life cycle cost (LCC) analysis were conducted. Environmental and
   economic impacts are normalized and weighted to identify the best
   overall performing windows. Environmentally, the low-solar gain windows
   always performed best due to the reduction in electricity needs, whereas
   economically they performed best in warmer climates but high-solar gain
   windows performed best in cooler climates. Thirteen of the seventeen
   cities had window options with a payback period less than five years
   when all retrofitting option were compared. When projecting the impacts
   of retrofitting a large number of homes, it was found that metro Atlanta
   could reduce CO2 emissions by about a half a million metric tons of CO2
   annually with any of the energy efficient window choices. (c) 2015

   experiments have been demonstrated, where the injection-locked WRC-FPLDs
   are directly modulated with up to 5-Gb/s on-off-keying (00K) upstream

   partial strong converse property to hold for memoryless but
   nonstationary symmetric and degraded wiretap channels. Our proof
   techniques leverage the information spectrum method, which allows us to

Abstract = {{The asymptotic size distribution of fractal particles undergoing
   Brownian and simultaneous shear-induced coagulation has not been
   investigated. We have addressed this issue by establishing and solving
   ordinary integro-differential coagulation equations. The self-preserving
   distribution (SPSD) requires a shear rate decreasing with time according
   to a formula, which we report, for various fractal dimensions. Under
   this condition, it is the Peclet number of primary particles that
   controls the self-preservative characteristics of coagulating
   aggregates. The size distribution of fractal aggregates at low Peclet
   numbers of primary particles was determined to be self-preserving. The
   SPSDs were calculated for aggregates of various fractal dimensions. An
   upper limit of the Peclet number exists where the SPSD could be
   obtained. This upper limit decreases with decreasing fractal dimension:
   from 1.1 for the fractal dimension of 3 to 0.14 for the fractal
   dimension of 1.8. The Peclet number of particles with the mean volume
   hydrodynamic radius is a constant during the coagulation process, and is
   proportional to the Peclet number of primary particles. As the Peclet
   number increases, the SPSDs will broaden, and the peak value will also
   increases and drifts to the left. The SPSD is close to a lognormal
   distribution. This represents a theoretical foundation for the size
   distribution evolution of coagulating fractal aggregates in flow fields
   and for the lognormal size distribution assumption of atmospheric
   aerosols. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metal implants are widely used to provide structural support and
   stability in current surgical treatments for bone fractures, spinal
   fusions, and joint arthroplasties as well as craniofacial and dental
   applications. Early implant-bone mechanical fixation is an important
   requirement for the successful performance of such implants. However,
   adequate osseointegration has been difficult to achieve especially in
   challenging disease states like osteoporosis due to reduced bone mass
   and strength. Here, we present a simple coating strategy based on
   passive adsorption of FN7-10, a recombinant fragment of human
   fibronectin encompassing the major cell adhesive, integrin-binding site,
   onto 316-grade stainless steel (SS). FN7-10 coating on SS surfaces
   promoted asp integrin-dependent adhesion and osteogenic differentiation
   of human mesenchymal stem cells. FN7-10-coated SS screws increased
   bone-implant mechanical fixation compared to uncoated screws by 30\% and
   45\% at 1 and 3 months, respectively, in healthy rats. Importantly,
   FN7-10 coating significantly enhanced bone-screw fixation by 57\% and
   32\% at 1 and 3 months, respectively, and bone-implant ingrowth by 30\%
   at 3 months compared to uncoated screws in osteoporotic rats. These
   coatings are easy to apply intra-operatively, even to implants with
   complex geometries and structures, facilitating the potential for rapid

Abstract = {{Various stem cells and their progeny have been used therapeutically for
   vascular regeneration. One of the major hurdles for cell-based therapy
   is low cell retention in vivo, and to improve cell survival several
   biomaterials have been used to encapsulate cells before transplantation.
   Vascular regeneration involves new blood vessel formation which consists
   of two processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. While embryonic stem
   cell (ESC)-derived endothelial cells (ESC-ECs) have clearer vasculogenic
   potency, adult cells exert their effects mainly through paracrine
   angiogenic activities. While these two cells have seemingly
   complementary advantages, there have not been any studies to date
   combining these two cell types for vascular regeneration. We have
   developed a novel chitosan-based hydrogel construct that encapsulates
   both CD31-expressing BM-mononuclear cells (BM-CD31(+) cells) and
   ESC-ECs, and is loaded with VEGF-releasing microtubes. This cell
   construct showed high cell survival and minimal cytotoxicity in vitro.
   When implanted into a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, it induced
   robust cell retention, neovascularization through vasculogenesis and
   angiogenesis, and efficiently induced recovery of blood flow in ischemic
   hindlimbs. This chitosan-based hydrogel encapsulating mixed adult and
   embryonic cell derivatives and containing VEGF can serve as a novel
   platform for treating various cardiovascular diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   advanced integrated passive device (IPD) fabrication process on a GaAs

   enable the directional coupler, which is constructed by the
   transformation of the intertwined mutual inductors and air-bridges, to
   have a compact size and high Q-factor. The fabricated coupler achieves
   only 0.43 dB of insertion loss S-21 and it exhibits the coupling S-31 of
   15.7 dB and the isolation S-41 of 27.2 dB. This presented coupler has an
   extra small size of only 0.72 x 0.82 mm(2) and an operational frequency
   of 910 MHz, which is appropriate for use in an RFID reader system. (c)

Abstract = {{A computational framework is developed to study the role of
   microstructure on the deformation behavior of Mo-Si-B alloys. A
   parametric range of idealized multi-phase microstructures of Mo-Si-B
   alloys are instantiated in 2D using Voronoi tessellation schemes and
   their deformation behavior modeled with the use of the finite element
   method. Continuum elements are used to model the constituent phases,
   while cohesive elements are used to model debonding at the interfaces of
   the intermetallic (A15 and T2) phases with the solid
   solution-strengthened Mo-ss matrix and cleavage fracture within the
   intermetallic phases. The deformation behavior of Mo-Si-B alloys is
   studied in terms of the simulated stress-strain response and
   microstructure evolution characteristics. Effects of various
   microstructure parameters, such as composition and clustering of
   intermetallic phases, on the tensile strength and ductility are also
   studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the phase transformation and residual stress distribution
   in the grinding of Maraging C250 steel were investigated. The wheel
   revolution per contact length is proposed as the effective wheel
   revolution to describe the effects. The occurrence of intensity changes,
   peak appearance, and indices of lattice on X-ray diffraction illustrates
   that the process parameters would influence the phase transformation,
   compressive stress, and tensile stress. The increment of effective wheel
   revolution will result in reduced phase transformation and enhanced
   residual stress. Finally, this study offers suggestions on the
   combination range of relevant process parameters based on the analysis.

   purposes}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Abstract = {{Desertification and soil degradation are becoming more serious due to
   global warming and concurrent extreme climate events. Although
   anti-desertification efforts have been mounted worldwide, most
   undertakings have shown poor performance because of failure to consider
   soil and geotechnical aspects. Soil erosion is accelerated by reductions
   in soil cohesion and water retention due to the transfer of fine
   particles from the original ground. Thus, soil internal cohesion must be
   recovered to ensure effective and reliable anti-desertification
   attempts. In this study, soil treatment using biopolymers is suggested
   as an alternative method to prevent soil erosion and for revitalization,
   taking into consideration engineering and environmental aspects. Even as
   a relatively small part of the soil mass (i.e., 0.5-1.0\%), biopolymers
   in soil have the positive potential to significantly reduce the
   erodibility of soil by enhancing inter-particle cohesion. Moreover,
   biopolymer treatment also improves both vegetation germination and soil
   water retention characteristics against evaporation, and therefore can
   provide suitable environments for plants and crops used as a
   desertification countermeasure in arid and semi-arid regions where
   annual precipitation is limited. We suggest combining biopolymers with
   pre-existing anti-desertification efforts (e.g., afforestation and
   windbreaks) on desert fronts (i.e., boundaries between arid and
   semi-arid regions) for best efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   experiments are conducted on some widely-used data sets. We carry out a

Abstract = {{Motivated by the current scheduling needs of complex resource allocation
   systems, this paper introduces a novel methodology for performance
   optimization in DES applications that evolve over very large and complex
   state spaces and the main objective is expressed as the long-run
   maximization of some reward rate. The proposed methodology leverages the
   Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) modeling framework in order to
   effect the seamless integration of the logical and performance-oriented
   control of the aforementioned applications, define a pertinent policy
   space, and (re-)cast the performance optimization problem into a
   mathematical programming formulation that is eventually solved through
   sensitivity analysis of Markov reward processes and stochastic
   approximation algorithms. An important attribute of the proposed
   methodology is that it facilitates an explicit control of the existing
   trade-off between the computational tractability of the employed
   formulation and the performance of the derived policies. Furthermore, by
   posing the eventually defined problem as a constrained nonlinear
   programming formulation, the presented methodology inherits all the
   analytical tools and insights that are offered by that vast area of
   optimization theory. In the current manuscript, all these possibilities
   are demonstrated through the application of the proposed approach to the
   throughput maximization of a capacitated re-entrant line abstracting the
   operation of an automated manufacturing cell.}},

Abstract = {{Laminated metallic alloy cores (i.e., alternating layers of thin film
   metallic alloy and insulating material) of appropriate lamination
   thickness enable suppression of eddy current losses at high frequencies.
   Magnetic cores comprised of many such laminations yield substantial
   overall magnetic volume, thereby enabling high-power operation.
   Previously, we reported nanolaminated permalloy (Ni-80 Fe-20) cores
   based on a sequential electrodeposition technique, demonstrating
   negligible eddy current losses at peak flux densities up to 0.5 T and
   operating at megahertz frequencies. This paper demonstrates improved
   performance of nanolaminated cores comprising tens to hundreds of layers
   of 300-500-nm-thick CoNiFe films that exhibit superior magnetic
   properties (e.g., higher saturation flux density and lower coercivity)
   than permalloy. Nanolaminated CoNiFe cores can be operated up to a peak
   flux density of 0.9 T, demonstrating improved power handling capacity
   and exhibiting 30\% reduced volumetric core loss, attributed to lowered
   hysteresis losses compared to the nanolaminated permalloy core of the
   same geometry. Operating these cores in a buck dc-dc power converter at
   a switching frequency of 1 MHz, the nanolaminated CoNiFe cores achieved
   a conversion efficiency exceeding 90\% at output power levels up to 7 W,
   compared to an achieved permalloy core conversion efficiency below 86\%
   at 6 W.}},

Abstract = {{The fleet acquisition process represents a major gamble for airlines and
   aircraft leasing companies due to the fixed assumptions made when
   business plans are laid out and the abundance of uncertainties both at
   the technical and market levels. Indeed, the evaluation of aircraft and
   engine acquisitions is riddled with uncertainties regarding the product
   development (development schedule), the economic performance of the
   assets once in operations (operating cost), and the demand for air
   transportation. The trend in recent years has been for original
   equipment manufacturers to offer contracts and guarantees during sales
   campaigns that limit the exposure of airlines to technical uncertainty
   and that shift some of the operating risks from the airlines to the
   manufacturers. Airlines have embraced these power-by-the-hour
   maintenance contracts because they offer a way to mitigate operating
   risks and to anticipate cash outflows. Estimating the fair value of
   these contracts is paramount due to the significant risks faced by
   companies underwriting them. At the same time, valuing them is a
   daunting task due to the uncertainty regarding maintenance costs and
   their sensitivity to both the operations and the operating environment.
   Traditional evaluation methods are not always well adapted to perform
   these evaluations as they do not capture the problem in its entirety and
   they tend to oversimplify by using generic routes and surrogate models.
   This paper simultaneously proposes a customer-centric methodology to
   properly evaluate long-term aircraft and engine investments and a
   real-options inspired methodology to value long-term maintenance
   contracts and manufacturer guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the simulation of supercritical fluids flowing
   inside small cooling channels. In the context of liquid rocket engines,
   a strong heat flux coming from the combustion chamber (locally phi
   approximate to 80 MW/m(2) for the Ariane 5 main-engine) may lead to very
   steep density gradients close to the wall. These gradients have to be
   thermodynamically and numerically captured to really understand the
   mechanism of heat transfer from the wall to the fluid. A shock-capturing
   WENO numerical scheme, usually used with the ideal gas law, was extended
   to real gases and applied to the simulation of an academic channel flow
   configuration that uses hydrogen as fluid. Results showed very elongated
   ligaments in the streamwise direction with a deep penetration in the
   wall-normal direction. A linear analysis was performed to link the
   fluctuations of compressibility factor (Z') to temperature fluctuations
   (T') in the case of an adiabatic and isothermal wall. The usual Strong
   Reynolds Analogy (SRA) could not be confirmed with real gas effects. Z
   fluctuations was found lower than 1\%, thus becoming harder to
   distinguish the physical fluctuations from the numerical error and a
   more refine simulation should be require to deliver a definitive
   conclusion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   constant mismatch, and particle contamination that may impact the
   performance of the ALD barrier. In such cases, a polymer smoothing layer
   may be needed to coat the surface prior to ALD barrier film deposition.
   We present the impact of architecture on the performance of aluminum
   oxide (Al2O3)/hafnium oxide (HfO2) ALD nanolaminate barrier films
   deposited on fluorinated polymer layer using an optical calcium (Ca)
   test under damp heat. It is found that with increasing polymer
   thickness, the barrier films with residual tensile stress are prone to
   cracking resulting in rapid failure of the Ca sensor at 50 degrees
   C/85\% relative humidity. Inserting a SiNx layer with residual
   compressive stress between the polymer and ALD layers is found to
   prevent cracking over a range of polymer thicknesses with more than 95\%
   of the Ca sensor remaining after 500 h of testing. These results suggest
   that controlling mechanical properties and film architecture play an
   important role in the performance of direct deposited ALD barriers. (C)

Abstract = {{Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million Americans and is characterized
   by impairment of cellular cardiac contractile function resulting in
   reduced ejection fraction in patients. Electrical stimulation such as
   cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and cardiac contractility
   modulation (CCM) have shown some success in treating patients with HF.
   Computer simulations have the potential to help improve such therapy
   (e.g. suggest optimal lead placement) as well as provide insight into
   the underlying mechanisms which could be beneficial. However, these
   myocyte models require a quantitatively accurate excitation-contraction
   coupling such that the electrical and contraction predictions are
   correct. While currently there are close to a hundred models describing
   the detailed electrophysiology of cardiac cells, the majority of cell
   models do not include the equations to reproduce contractile force or
   they have been added ad hoc. Here we present a systematic methodology to
   couple first generation contraction models into electrophysiological
   models via intracellular calcium and then compare the resulting model
   predictions to experimental data. This is done by using a
   post-extrasystolic pacing protocol, which captures essential dynamics of
   contractile forces. We found that modeling the dynamic intracellular
   calcium buffers is necessary in order to reproduce the experimental
   data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in models the mechanism of the
   post-extrasystolic potentiation is highly dependent on the calcium
   released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Overall this study provides
   new insights into both specific and general determinants of cellular
   contractile force and provides a framework for incorporating contraction
   into electrophysiological models, both of which will be necessary to
   develop reliable simulations to optimize electrical therapies for HF.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically small antennas (ESAs) are becoming one of the key
   components in the compact wireless devices for telecommunications,
   defence, and aerospace systems, especially for the spherical one whose
   geometric layout is more closely approaching Chu's limit, thus yielding
   significant bandwidth improvements relative to the linear and planar
   counterparts. Yet broad applications of the volumetric ESAs are still
   hindered since the low cost fabrication has remained a tremendous
   challenge. Here we report a state-of-the-art technology to transfer
   electrically conductive composites (ECCs) from a planar mould to a
   volumetric thermoplastic substrate by using pad-printing technology
   without pattern distortion, benefit from the excellent properties of the
   ECCs as well as the printing-calibration method that we developed. The
   antenna samples prepared in this way meet the stringent requirement of
   an ESA (ka is as low as 0.32 and the antenna efficiency is as high as
   57\%), suggesting that volumetric electronic components i.e. the
   antennas can be produced in such a simple, green, and cost-effective
   way. This work can be of interest for the development of studies on
   green and high performance wireless communication devices.}},

Title = {{A tree-like Bayesian structure learning algorithm for small-sample
   datasets from complex biological model systems}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are increasing efforts to bring high-throughput
   systems biology techniques to bear on complex animal model systems,
   often with a goal of learning about underlying regulatory network
   structures (e.g., gene regulatory networks). However, complex animal
   model systems typically have significant limitations on cohort sizes,
   number of samples, and the ability to perform follow-up and validation
   experiments. These constraints are particularly problematic for many
   current network learning approaches, which require large numbers of
   samples and may predict many more regulatory relationships than actually
   exist.
   Results: Here, we test the idea that by leveraging the accuracy and
   efficiency of classifiers, we can construct high-quality networks that
   capture important interactions between variables in datasets with few
   samples. We start from a previously-developed tree-like Bayesian
   classifier and generalize its network learning approach to allow for
   arbitrary depth and complexity of tree-like networks. Using four diverse
   sample networks, we demonstrate that this approach performs consistently
   better at low sample sizes than the Sparse Candidate Algorithm, a
   representative approach for comparison because it is known to generate
   Bayesian networks with high positive predictive value. We develop and
   demonstrate a resampling-based approach to enable the identification of
   a viable root for the learned tree-like network, important for cases
   where the root of a network is not known a priori. We also develop and
   demonstrate an integrated resampling-based approach to the reduction of
   variable space for the learning of the network. Finally, we demonstrate
   the utility of this approach via the analysis of a transcriptional
   dataset of a malaria challenge in a non-human primate model system,
   Macaca mulatta, suggesting the potential to capture indicators of the
   earliest stages of cellular differentiation during leukopoiesis.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that by starting from effective and
   efficient approaches for creating classifiers, we can identify
   interesting tree-like network structures with significant ability to
   capture the relationships in the training data. This approach represents
   a promising strategy for inferring networks with high positive
   predictive value under the constraint of small numbers of samples,
   meeting a need that will only continue to grow as more high-throughput
   studies are applied to complex model systems.}},

Abstract = {{Structure quantification is key to successful mining and extraction of
   core materials knowledge from both multiscale simulations as well as
   multiscale experiments. The main challenge stems from the need to
   transform the inherently high dimensional representations demanded by
   the rich hierarchical material structure into useful, high value, low
   dimensional representations. In this paper, we develop and demonstrate
   the merits of a data-driven approach for addressing this challenge at
   the atomic scale. The approach presented here is built on prior
   successes demonstrated for mesoscale representations of material
   internal structure, and involves three main steps: (i) digital
   representation of the material structure, (ii) extraction of a
   comprehensive set of structure measures using the framework of n-point
   spatial correlations, and (iii) identification of data-driven low
   dimensional measures using principal component analyses. These novel
   protocols, applied on an ensemble of structure datasets output from
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, have successfully classified the
   datasets based on several model input parameters such as the interatomic
   potential and the temperature used in the MD simulations.}},

Pages = {{5780-5790}},

Abstract = {{The combination of appreciable swelling at unit activity sorption, weak
   polymer-penetrant interactions, and high vapor pressure allows methanol
   to be effective at restoring free volume to glassy polymers compared to
   similar organics. Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are often
   soaked in methanol and then dried before permeation and sorption
   analysis to improve reproducibility and eliminate processing history.
   Here, surface area, pore volume, thermogravimetric analysis, sorption,
   and diffusion data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of methanol
   treatments at removing nonsolvent-induced changes to PIM-1, specifically
   using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a candidate conditioning molecule. DMF
   clearly plasticizes PIM-1 while methanol does not. In addition, diethyl
   ether-conditioned PIM-1 showed marked increases in surface area and free
   volume-higher than that found from methanol conditioning. Strongly
   plasticizing nonsolvents with low vapor pressures can be used as
   conditioning agents that promote polymer relaxations, accelerate chain
   packing, and remove additional nonequilibrium free volume.}},

Abstract = {{Neointimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) plays a
   critical role in atherosclerotic plaque formation and in-stent
   restenosis, but the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely
   understood. We performed a proteomics study to identify novel signaling
   molecules organizing the VSMC hyperplasia. The differential proteomics
   analysis in a balloon- induced injury model of rat carotid artery
   revealed that the expressions of 44 proteins are changed within 3 days
   post injury. The combination of cellular function assays and a protein
   network analysis further demonstrated that 27 out of 44 proteins
   constitute key signaling networks orchestrating the phenotypic change of
   VSMC from contractile to epithelial-like synthetic. Among the list of
   proteins, the in vivo validation specifically revealed that six proteins
   (Rab 15, ITR, OLR1, PDH beta, PTP epsilon) are positive regulators for
   VSMC hyperplasia. In particular, the OLR1 played dual roles in the VSMC
   hyperplasia by directly mediating oxidized LDL-induced monocyte adhesion
   via NF-kappa B activation and by assisting the PDGF-induced
   proliferation/migration. Importantly, OLR1 and PDGFR beta were
   associated in close proximity in the plasma membrane. Thus, this study
   elicits the protein network organizing the phenotypic change of VSMC in
   the vascular injury diseases such as atherosclerosis and discovers OLR1
   as a novel molecular link between the proliferative and inflammatory
   responses of VSMCs.}},

Abstract = {{The piezotronic effect uses strain-induced piezoelectric charges at
   interfaces and junctions to tune and/ or control carrier transport in
   piezoelectric semiconductor devices. This effect has recently been
   observed in single-layer 2D MoS2 materials. However, previous work had
   found that metallic states are generated at the edge of a free-standing
   MoS2 flat sheet, and these states may screen the piezoelectric charges.
   Using density functional theory simulations, we found that the
   metal-MoS2 interface structure plays an important role in enhancing both
   the piezoelectric and piezotronic effects in MoS2 transistors by
   breaking the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge. This
   study not only provides an understanding of the piezoelectric and
   piezotronic effects based on first principles calculations but also
   offers guidance for the design of two-dimensional piezotronic devices.

Title = {{Multidimensional dynamic piezoresponse measurements: Unraveling local
   relaxation behavior in relaxor-ferroelectrics via big data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Compositional and charge disorder in ferroelectric relaxors lies at the
   heart of the unusual properties of these systems, such as aging and
   non-ergodicity, polarization rotations, and a host of temperature and
   field-driven phase transitions. However, much information about the
   field-dynamics of the polarization in the prototypical ferroelectric
   relaxor (1 - x) Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-xPbTiO(3) (PMN-xPT) remains unprobed
   at the mesoscopic level. Here, we use a piezoresponse force
   microscopy-based dynamic multimodal relaxation spectroscopy technique,
   enabling the study of ferroelectric switching and polarization
   relaxation at mesoscopic length scales, and carry out measurements on a
   PMN-0.28PT sample with minimal polishing. Results indicate that beyond a
   threshold DC bias the average relaxation increases as the system
   attempts to relax to the previous state. Phenomenological fitting
   reveals the presence of mesoscale heterogeneity in relaxation amplitudes
   and clearly suggests the presence of two distinct amplitudes.
   Independent component analysis reveals the presence of a disorder
   component of the relaxation, which is found to be strongly
   anti-correlated with the maximum piezoresponse at that location,
   suggesting smaller disorder effects where the polarization reversal is
   large and vice versa. The disorder in the relaxation amplitudes is
   postulated to arise from rhombohedral and field-induced tetragonal phase
   in the crystal, with each phase associated with its own relaxation
   amplitude. These studies highlight the crucial importance of the mixture
   of ferroelectric phases in the compositions in proximity of the
   morphotropic phase boundary in governing the local response and further
   highlight the ability of PFM voltage and time spectroscopies, in
   conjunction with big-data multivariate analyses, to locally map disorder
   and correlate it with parameters governing the dynamic behavior. (C)

Title = {{Implications of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment Using the WHO/ISH
   Risk Prediction Charts in Rural India}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in India is currently assessed using
   the World Health Organization/International Society for Hypertension
   (WHO/ISH) risk prediction charts since no population-specific models
   exist. The WHO/ISH risk prediction charts have two versions -one with
   total cholesterol as a predictor (the high information (HI) model) and
   the other without (the low information (LI) model). However, information
   on the WHO/ISH risk prediction charts including guidance on which
   version to use and when, as well as relative performance of the LI and
   HI models, is limited. This article aims to, firstly, quantify the
   relative performance of the LI and HI WHO/ISH risk prediction (for
   WHO-South East Asian Region D) using data from rural India. Secondly, we
   propose a pre-screening (simplified) point-of-care (POC) test to
   identify patients who are likely to benefit from a total cholesterol
   (TC) test, and subsequently when the LI model is preferential to HI
   model. Analysis was performed using cross-sectional data from rural
   Andhra Pradesh collected in 2005 with recorded blood cholesterol
   measurements (N = 1066). CVD risk was computed using both LI and HI
   models, and high risk individuals who needed treatment(T-HR) were
   subsequently identified based on clinical guidelines. Model development
   for the POC assessment of a TC test was performed through three machine
   learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Regularised Logistic
   Regression (RLR), and Random Forests (RF) along with a feature selection
   process. Disagreement in CVD risk predicted by LI and HI WHO/ISH models
   was 14.5\% (n = 155; p<0.01) overall and comprised 36 clinically
   relevant T-HR patients (31\% of patients identified as T-HR by using
   either model). Using two patient-specific parameters (age, systolic
   blood pressure), our POC assessment can pre-determine the benefit of TC
   testing and choose the appropriate risk model (out-of-sample AUCs:
   RF-0.85, SVM-0.84, RLR: 0.82 and maximum sensitivity-98\%). The
   identification of patients benefitting from a TC test for CVD risk
   stratification can aid planning for resource-allocation and save costs
   for large-scale screening programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Increased sequencing of microbial genomes has revealed that prevailing
   prokaryotic species assignments can be inconsistent with whole genome
   information for a significant number of species. The long-standing need
   for a systematic and scalable species assignment technique can be met by
   the genome-wide Average Nucleotide Identity (gANI) metric, which is
   widely acknowledged as a robust measure of genomic relatedness. In this
   work, we demonstrate that the combination of gANI and the alignment
   fraction (AF) between two genomes accurately reflects their genomic
   relatedness. We introduce an efficient implementation of AF, gANI and
   discuss its successful application to 86.5M genome pairs between 13,151
   prokaryotic genomes assigned to 3032 species. Subsequently, by comparing
   the genome clusters obtained from complete linkage clustering of these
   pairs to existing taxonomy, we observed that nearly 18\% of all
   prokaryotic species suffer from anomalies in species definition. Our
   results can be used to explore central questions such as whether
   microorganisms form a continuum of genetic diversity or distinct species
   represented by distinct genetic signatures. We propose that this precise
   and objective AF, gANI-based species definition: the MiSI (Microbial
   Species Identifier) method, be used to address previous inconsistencies
   in species classification and as the primary guide for new taxonomic
   species assignment, supplemented by the traditional polyphasic approach,
   as required.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is generally accepted that amino acids were present on the
   prebiotic Earth, the mechanism by which alpha-amino acids were condensed
   into polypeptides before the emergence of enzymes remains unsolved.
   Here, we demonstrate a prebiotically plausible mechanism for peptide
   (amide) bond formation that is enabled by alpha-hydroxy acids, which
   were likely present along with amino acids on the early Earth. Together,
   alpha-hydroxy acids and alpha-amino acids form depsipeptides-oligomers
   with a combination of ester and amide linkages-in model prebiotic
   reactions that are driven by wet-cool/dry-hot cycles. Through a
   combination of ester-amide bond exchange and ester bond hydrolysis,
   depsipeptides are enriched with amino acids over time. These results
   support a long-standing hypothesis that peptides might have arisen from
   ester-based precursors.}},

   which we refer to as the r-Pulay method. We demonstrate the efficacy of
   r-Pulay in the context of the Jacobi iteration for solving large linear
   systems of equations, as well as in the Self Consistent Field (SCF)
   approach for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Overall, we
   find r-Pulay to be an attractive version of the restarted DIIS method.

Abstract = {{Meshing complex engineering domains is a challenging task. Arbitrary
   polyhedral meshes can provide the much needed flexibility in automated
   discretization of such domains. The geometric property of polyhedral
   meshes such as its unstructured nature and the connectivity of faces
   between elements makes them specially attractive for topology
   optimization applications. Numerical anomalies in designs such as the
   single node connections and checkerboard pattern can be naturally
   circumvented with polyhedrons. In the current work, we solve the
   governing three-dimensional elasticity state equation using the Virtual
   Element Method (VEM) approach. The main characteristic difference
   between VEM and standard finite element methods (FEM) is that in VEM the
   canonical basis functions are not constructed explicitly. Rather the
   stiffness matrix is computed directly utilizing a projection map which
   extracts the linear component of the deformation. Such a construction
   guarantees the satisfaction of the patch test (used by engineers as an
   indicator of optimal convergence of numerical solutions under mesh
   refinement). Finally, the computations reduce to the evaluation of
   matrices which contain purely geometric surface facet quantities. The
   present work focuses on the first-order VEM in which the degrees of
   freedom are associated with the vertices. The features of the current
   optimization approach are demonstrated using numerical examples for
   compliance minimization and compliant mechanism problems. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main risk factor for
   glaucoma. Exogenous nitric oxide (NO) decreases IOP by increasing
   outflow facility, but whether endogenous NO production contributes to
   the physiological regulation of outflow facility is unclear. Outflow
   facility was measured by pressure-controlled perfusion in ex vivo eyes
   from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or transgenic mice expressing human
   endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP)
   superimposed on the endogenously expressed murine eNOS (eNOS-GFPtg). In
   WT mice, exogenous NO delivered by 100 mu M
   S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) increased outflow facility by 62
   +/- 28\% (SD) relative to control eyes perfused with the inactive SNAP
   analog N-acetyl-D-penicillamine (NAP; n = 5, P = 0.016). In contrast, in
   eyes from eNOS-GFPtg mice, SNAP had no effect on outflow facility
   relative to NAP (-9 +/- 4\%, P = 0.40). In WT mice, the nonselective NOS
   inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 mu M) decreased
   outflow facility by 36 +/- 13\% (n = 5 each, P = 0.012), but 100 mu M
   L-NAME had no detectable effect on outflow facility (-16 +/- 5\%, P =
   0.22). An eNOS-selective inhibitor (cavtratin, 50 mu M) decreased
   outflow facility by 19 +/- 12\% in WT (P = 0.011) and 39 +/- 25\% in
   eNOS-GFPtg (P = 0.014) mice. In the conventional outflow pathway of
   eNOS-GFPtg mice, eNOS-GFP expression was localized to endothelial cells
   lining Schlemm's canal and the downstream vessels, with no apparent
   expression in the trabecular meshwork. These results suggest that
   endogenous NO production by eNOS within endothelial cells of Schlemm's
   canal or downstream vessels contributes to the physiological regulation
   of aqueous humor outflow facility in mice, representing a viable
   strategy to more successfully lower IOP in glaucoma.}},

   bridges in California}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Fragility analyses is a powerful tool for the seismic risk assessment of
   highway bridges. Multispan continuous concrete box-girder bridges
   account for the bulk of the California bridge inventory. Although
   several studies have looked at the seismic response and fragility of
   individual box-girder bridges, very little research has explored the
   fragility of the box-girder bridge class holistically. Exacerbating this
   situation is the lack of considerations of design details unique to the
   era in which the bridges were designed and constructed, in their
   fragility development. This paper addresses this gap by investigating
   the influence of evolution of seismic design principles and details on
   the seismic performance of multispan continuous concrete box-girder
   bridge class, as well as the failure probability through the development
   of fragility curves across three design eras demarcated by the 1971 San
   Fernando and 1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes. Detailed nonlinear analytical
   models capturing the bridge characteristics within a design era are
   developed and nonlinear time history analysis is employed to develop
   analytical fragility curves. Significant improvement in performance is
   seen in modern bridges designed according to capacity design principles.

Abstract = {{Nano-LiFePO4/C cathode materials have been synthesized by a solid state
   reaction method using Tween60-Span60 composite as surfactant and carbon
   source. The Tween60-Span60 composite surfactants together lead a strong
   space steric effect, which ensures a high surface energy and reaction
   kinetic of the precursors. Consequently, it contributes to the formation
   of uniformly distributed LiFePO4 particles coated with a thin layer of
   carbon. The unique structured LiFePO4/C cathode materials can deliver
   high electrochemical capacities of 166, 150.5 and 130.1 mAh g(-1) under
   0.1 C at 25, 0 and -20 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the LiFePO4/C
   cathode materials demonstrate an excellent rate capability and cycle
   performance, no discernible specific discharge capacity fading has been
   observed after over 400 cycles under the rate of 0.1-5 C at 25 degrees
   C, or after over 100 cycles under the rate of 0.1-0.5 C at -20 degrees

Title = {{A wireless video multicasting scheme based on multi-scale compressed
   sensing}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Video multicast is becoming more and more popular in wireless multimedia
   applications, in which one major challenge is to offer heterogeneous
   users with a graceful degradation against varying packet loss ratios and
   channel noise. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale compressed
   sensing-based wireless video multicast scheme, abbreviated as MCS-cast.
   The encoder of MCS-cast decomposes each video frame through a discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) and explores an optimized compressed sensing
   (CS) rate to sample/measure each DWT level. The CS measurements are then
   packed in such a way that all packets are made as equally important as
   possible, while each packet includes different percentages of different
   DWT levels. Finally, the packets are transmitted via an analog-like
   modulator with mapping of the measurements into a very dense
   constellation. We demonstrate that because of larger percentages of more
   important DWT levels in each packet, packet loss leads to a much reduced
   influence on the reconstruction quality. Experimental results show that
   our MCS-cast preserves the property of graceful degradation for
   heterogeneous users and can outperform the state-of-the-art SoftCast by
   up to 3 dB in PSNR at high packet loss ratios (over the same noisy
   channel).}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Contact electrification between two different materials is one of the
   oldest fields of study in solidstate physics. Here, we introduced an
   innovative system based on optical electric-field-induced second
   harmonic generation (EFI-SHG) technique that can directly monitor the
   dynamic performance of the contact electrification on the surface of
   polyimide film. After the contact, the EFI-SHG system visualized briefly
   three relaxations of the tribo-induced charges on the surface of a
   polyimide film, a fast relaxation within 3 min followed by two much
   slower relaxations, which were possibly related to different charge
   diffusion routes. The contact electrification under several special
   experimental conditions (wind, water and steam) was studied to
   demonstrate the high flexibility and material selectivity of the
   EFI-SHG. The EFI-SHG studies confirmed the motion of the water can
   remove the surface charge, while the appearance and the evaporation of a
   thin water layer cannot enhance the charge diffusion. We anticipate that
   this experimental technique will find a variety of applications in the
   field of contact electrification and the development of the recently
   invented triboelectric nano generator.}},

Abstract = {{Surface adsorbates are well-established choreographers of material
   synthesis, but the presence and impact of these short-lived species on
   semiconductor nanowire growth are largely unknown. Here, we use infrared
   spectroscopy to directly observe surface adsorbates, hydrogen atoms and
   methyl groups, chemisorbed to the nanowire sidewall and show they are
   essential for the stable growth of Ge nanowires via the vapor liquid
   solid mechanism. We quantitatively determine the surface coverage of
   hydrogen atoms during nanowire growth by comparing nu(Ge-H) absorption
   bands from operando measurements (i.e., during growth) to those after
   saturating the nanowire sidewall with hydrogen atoms. This method
   provides sub-monolayer chemical information at relevant reaction
   conditions while accounting for the heterogeneity of sidewall surface
   sites and their evolution during elongation. Our findings demonstrate
   that changes to surface bonding are critical to understand Ge nanowire
   synthesis and provide new guidelines for rationally selecting catalysts,
   forming heterostructures, and controlling dopant profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 4-vinylpyridine, t-butyl
   acrylate, and styrene in sequential order from a beta-cyclodextrin core
   yielded an amphiphilic starlike triblock copolymer,
   poly(4-vinylpyridine)-block-poly(t-butyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene
   (P4VP-b-PtBA-b-PS). Subsequently, star-like triblock copolymer composed
   of inner hydrophilic P4VP blocks, central hydrophobic PtBA blocks, and
   outer hydrophobic PS blocks with well-defined molecular architecture and
   molecular weight of each block was judiciously exploited as nanoreactor
   for synthesis of precisely shaped hairy plasmonic/semiconductor Au/TiO2,
   core/shell nanoparticles. The resulting Au/TiO2 nanoparticles were
   intimately and permanently tethered with outer PS chains that enabled
   the superior solubility of nanoparticles in nonpolar solvents. The PS
   chains on the surface of these bifunctional nanoparticles were
   carbonized by annealing in an inert atmosphere (i.e., yielding
   carbon-coated Au/TiO2 nanoparticles). In comparison to a widely used
   TiO2 network film (i.e., P25)-based device, dye-sensitized solar cells
   assembled by incorporating a thin layer of carbonized Au/TiO2
   nanoparticles on the top of P25 film as photoanode exhibited largely
   improved short-circuit current density, J(SC) (18.4\% increase), and
   power conversion efficiency, PCE (13.6\% increase), respectively. Such
   improvements were attributed to the surface plasmon-enabled light
   harvesting enhancement of Au core and fast electron transport promoted
   by the carbon layer coating on Au/TiO2 nanoparticles, as revealed by
   external quantum efficiency (EQE), UV-vis spectroscopy, and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a simple methodology for the computation of symmetry-adapted
   perturbation theory (SAPT) interaction energy contributions for
   intramolecular noncovalent interactions. In this approach, the local
   occupied orbitals of the total Hartree-Fock (HF) wavefunction are used
   to partition the fully interacting system into three chemically
   identifiable units: the noncovalent fragments A and B and a covalent
   linker C. Once these units are identified, the noninteracting HF
   wavefunctions of the fragments A and B are separately optimized while
   embedded in the HF wavefunction of C, providing the dressed zeroth order
   wavefunctions for A and B in the presence of C. Standard two-body SAPT
   (particularly SAPT0) is then applied between the relaxed wavefunctions
   for A and B. This intramolecular SAPT procedure is found to be
   remarkably straightforward and efficient, as evidenced by example
   applications ranging from diols to hexaphenyl-ethane derivatives. (C)

Abstract = {{The mechanism of action of the widely used in vivo ferric chloride
   (FeCl3) thrombosis model remains poorly understood; although endothelial
   cell denudation is historically cited, a recent study refutes this and
   implicates a role for erythrocytes. Given the complexity of the in vivo
   environment, an in vitro reductionist approach is required to
   systematically isolate and analyze the biochemical, mass transfer, and
   biological phenomena that govern the system. To this end, we designed an
   ``endothelial-ized{''} microfluidic device to introduce controlled FeCl3
   concentrations to the molecular and cellular components of blood and
   vasculature. FeCl3 induces aggregation of all plasma proteins and blood
   cells, independent of endothelial cells, by colloidal chemistry
   principles: initial aggregation is due to binding of negatively charged
   blood components to positively charged iron, independent of biological
   receptor/ligand interactions. Full occlusion of the microchannel
   proceeds by conventional pathways, and can be attenuated by
   antithrombotic agents and loss-of-function proteins (as in IL4-R/lba
   mice). As elevated FeCl3 concentrations overcome protective effects, the
   overlap between charge-based aggregation and clotting is a function of
   mass transfer. Our physiologically relevant in vitro system allows us to
   discern the multifaceted mechanism of FeCl3-induced thrombosis, thereby
   reconciling literature findings and cautioning researchers in using the
   FeCl3 model.}},

Title = {{Considerations for resting state functional MRI and functional
   connectivity studies in rodents}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and functional connectivity
   mapping have become widely used tools in the human neuroimaging
   community and their use is rapidly spreading into the realm of rodent
   research as well. One of the many attractive features of rs-fMRI is that
   it is readily translatable from humans to animals and back again.
   Changes in functional connectivity observed in human studies can be
   followed by more invasive animal experiments to determine the
   neurophysiological basis for the alterations, while exploratory work in
   animal models can identify possible biomarkers for further investigation
   in human studies. These types of interwoven human and animal experiments
   have a potentially large impact on neuroscience and clinical practice.
   However, impediments exist to the optimal application of rs-fMRI in
   small animals, some similar to those encountered in humans and some
   quite different. In this review we identify the most prominent of these
   barriers, discuss differences between rs-fMRI in rodents and in humans,
   highlight best practices for animal studies, and review selected
   applications of rs-fMRI in rodents. Our goal is to facilitate the
   integration of human and animal work to the benefit of both fields.}},

Abstract = {{Organic pi-conjugated materials have been widely used for a variety of
   nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. Molecules with negative real
   components Re(gamma) of the third-order polarizability, which leads to
   nonlinear refraction in macroscopic systems, have important benefits for
   several NLO applications. However, few organic systems studied to date
   have negative Re(gamma) in the long wavelength limit, and all inorganic
   materials show positive nonlinear refraction in this limit. Here, we
   introduce a new class of molecules of the form X(C6H5)(4), where X = B-,
   C, N+, and P+, that have negative Re(gamma). The molecular mechanism for
   the NLO properties in these systems is very different from those in
   typical linear conjugated systems: These systems have a band of excited
   states involving single-electron excitations within the pi-system,
   several of which have significant coupling to the ground state. Thus,
   Re(gamma) cannot be understood in terms of a simplified essential-state
   model and must be analyzed in the context of the full sum-over-states
   expression. Although Re(gamma) is significantly smaller than that of
   other commonly studied NLO chromophores, the introduction of a new
   molecular architecture offering the potential for a negative Re(gamma)
   introduces new avenues of molecular design for NLO applications.}},

Title = {{Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for chronic hepatitis
   C in the US}},
Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The standard care of treatment of interferon plus ribavirin
   (plus protease inhibitor for genotype 1) are effective in 50 \% to 70 \%
   of patients with CHC. Several new treatments including Harvoni, Olysio +
   Sovaldi, Viekira Pak, Sofosbuvir-based regimens characterized with
   potent inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA) providing more options for CHC patients. Trials have shown that
   the new treatments increased the rate to 80 \% to 95 \%, though with a
   substantial increase in cost. In particular, current market pricing of a
   12-week course of sofosbuvir is approximately US\$84,000. We determine
   the cost-effectiveness of new treatments in comparison with the standard
   care of treatments.
   Methods: A Markov simulation model of CHC disease progression is used to
   evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies based
   on genotype. The model calculates the expected lifetime medical costs
   and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of hypothetical cohorts of
   identical patients receiving certain treatments. For genotype 1, we
   compare: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin + telaprevir for 12 weeks,
   followed by 12 or 24 weeks treatment of peginterferon + ribavirin
   dependent on HCV RNA level at week 12; (2) Harvoni treatment, 12 weeks;
   (3) Olysio + Sovaldi, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks
   for patients with cirrhosis; (4) Viekira Pak + ribavirin, 12 weeks for
   patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (5)
   sofosbuvir + peginterferon + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with or
   without cirrhosis. For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment strategies include:
   (1) peginterferon + ribavirin, 24 weeks for treatment-naive patients;
   (2) sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with genotype 2, 24
   weeks for genotype 3; (3) peginterferon + ribavirin as initial
   treatment, 24 weeks for patients with genotype 2/3, follow-up treatment
   with sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12/16 weeks are performed on
   non-responders and relapsers.
   Results: Viekira Pak is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients without
   cirrhosis, whereas Harvoni is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients
   with cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir-based treatments for genotype 1 in general
   are not cost-effective due to its substantial high costs. Two-phase
   treatments with 12-week and 16-week follow-ups are cost-effective for
   genotype 3 patients and for genotype 2 patients with cirrhosis. The
   results were shown to be robust over a broad range of parameter values
   through sensitivity analysis.
   Conclusions: For genotype 1, sofosbuvir-based treatments are not
   cost-effective compared to Viekira Pak and Harvoni, although a 30 \%
   reduction in sofosbuvir price would change this result. Sofosbuvir +
   ribavirin are cost-effective as second-phase treatments following
   peginterferon + ribavirin initial treatment for genotypes 2 and 3.
   However, there is limited data on sofosbuvir-involved treatment, and the
   results obtained in this study must be interpreted within the model
   assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to
   predict the degradation mechanisms and fates of intermediates and
   byproducts that are produced during aqueous-phase advanced oxidation
   processes (AOPs). The on-the-fly KMC model is composed of a reaction
   pathway generator, a reaction rate constant estimator, a mechanistic
   reduction module, and a KMC solver. The novelty of this work is that we
   develop the pathway as we march forward in time rather than developing
   the pathway before we use the KMC method to solve the equations. As a
   result, we have fewer reactions to consider, and we have greater
   computational efficiency. We have verified this on-the-fly KMC model for
   the degradation of polyacrylamide (PAM) using UV light and titanium
   dioxide (i.e., UV/TiO2). Using the on-the-fly KMC model, we were able to
   predict the time-dependent profiles of the average molecular weight for
   PAM. The model provided detailed and quantitative insights into the time
   evolution of the molecular weight distribution and reaction mechanism.
   We also verified our on-the-fly KMC model for the destruction of (I)
   acetone, (2) trichloroethylene (TCE), and (3) polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   for the ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide AOP. We demonstrated
   that the on-the-fly KMC model can achieve the same accuracy as the
   computer-based first-principles KMC (CF-KMC) model, which has already
   been validated in our earlier work. The on-the-fly KMC is particularly
   suitable for molecules with large molecular weights (e.g., polymers)
   because the degradation mechanisms for large molecules can result in
   hundreds of thousands to even millions of reactions. The ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs) that describe the degradation pathways
   cannot be solved using traditional numerical methods, but the KMC can
   solve these equations.}},

Abstract = {{Generic force fields such as UFF and DREIDING are widely used for
   predicting molecular adsorption and diffusion in metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs), but the accuracy of these force fields is unclear. We
   describe a general framework for developing transferable force fields
   for modeling the adsorption of alkanes in a nonflexible MIL-47(V) MOF
   using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By
   calculating the interaction energies for a large number of energetically
   favorable adsorbate configurations using DFT, we obtain a force field
   that gives good predictions of adsorption isotherms, heats of
   adsorption, and diffusion properties for a wide range of alkanes and
   alkenes in MIL-47(V). The force field is shown to be transferable to
   related materials such as MIL-53(Cr) and is used to calculate the
   free-energy differences for the experimentally observed phases of
   MIL-53(Fe).}},

Title = {{Thermal Transport in Fullerene Derivatives Using Molecular Dynamics
   Simulations}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{In order to study the effects of alkyl chain on the thermal properties
   of fullerene derivatives, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   to predict the thermal conductivity of fullerene (C-60) and its
   derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The results of
   non-equilibrium MD simulations show a length-dependent thermal
   conductivity for C-60 but not for PCBM. The thermal conductivity of
   C-60, obtained from the linear extrapolation of inverse conductivity vs.
   inverse length curve, is 0.2 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature, while the
   thermal conductivity of PCBM saturates at similar to 0.075 W m(-1) K-1
   around 20 nm. The different length-dependence behavior of thermal
   conductivity indicates that the long-wavelength and low-frequency
   phonons have large contribution to the thermal conduction in C-60. The
   decrease in thermal conductivity of fullerene derivatives can be
   attributed to the reduction in group velocities, the decrease of the
   frequency range of acoustic phonons, and the strong scattering of
   low-frequency phonons with the alkyl chains due to the significant
   mismatch of vibrational density of states in low frequency regime
   between buckyball and alkyl chains in PCBM.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelet-based distribution-free tabular CUSUM chart based on adaptive
   thresholding, WDFTCa is designed for rapidly detecting shifts in the
   mean of a high-dimensional profile whose noise components have a
   continuous nonsingular multivariate distribution. First computing a
   discrete wavelet transform of the noise vectors for randomly sampled
   Phase I (in-control) profiles, WDFTCa uses a matrix-regularization
   method to estimate the covariance matrix of the wavelet-transformed
   noise vectors; then, those vectors are aggregated (batched) so that the
   non-overlapping batch means of the wavelet-transformed noise vectors
   have manageable covariances. Lower and upper in-control thresholds are
   computed for the resulting batch means of the wavelet-transformed noise
   vectors using the associated marginal Cornish-Fisher expansions that
   have been suitably adjusted for between-component correlations. From the
   thresholded batch means of the wavelet-transformed noise vectors,
   Hotelling's T-2-type statistics are computed to set the parameters of a
   CUSUM procedure. To monitor shifts in the mean profile during Phase II
   (regular) operation, T-2-type statistic from successive thresholded
   batch means of the wavelet-transformed noise vectors using the
   in-control thresholds; then WDFTCa applies the CUSUM procedure to the
   resulting T-2-type statistics. Experimentation with several normal and
   non-normal test processes revealed that WDFTCa outperformed existing
   non-adaptive profile-monitoring schemes.}},

Title = {{VERITAS DETECTION OF gamma-RAY FLARING ACTIVITY FROM THE BL LAC OBJECT
   1ES 1727+502 DURING BRIGHT MOONLIGHT OBSERVATIONS}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{808}},

Abstract = {{During moonlit nights, observations with ground-based Cherenkov
   telescopes at very high energies (VHEs, E > 100 GeV) are constrained
   since the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in the telescope camera are
   extremely sensitive to the background moonlight. Observations with the
   VERITAS telescopes in the standard configuration are performed only with
   a moon illumination less than 35\% of full moon. Since 2012, the VERITAS
   collaboration has implemented a new observing mode under bright
   moonlight, by either reducing the voltage applied to the PMTs
   (reduced-high-voltage; RHV configuration), or by utilizing
   UV-transparent filters. While these operating modes result in lower
   sensitivity and increased energy thresholds, the extension of the
   available observing time is useful for monitoring variable sources such
   as blazars and sources requiring spectral measurements at the highest
   energies. In this paper we report the detection of gamma-ray flaring
   activity from the BL Lac object 1ES 1727+502 during RHV observations.
   This detection represents the first evidence of VHE variability from
   this blazar. The integral flux is (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-11) cm(-2) s(-1)
   above 250 GeV, which is about five times higher than the low-flux state.
   The detection triggered additional VERITAS observations during standard
   dark-time. Multiwavelength observations with the FLWO 48 `' telescope,
   and the Swift and Fermi satellites are presented and used to produce the
   first spectral energy distribution (SED) of this object during gamma-ray
   flaring activity. The SED is then fitted with a standard
   synchrotron-self-Compton model, placing constraints on the properties of
   the emitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of
   the relativistic particle population in the jet.}},

Abstract = {{We present the initial results and the source catalog from the Nuclear
   Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) survey of the Extended Chandra
   Deep Field South (hereafter, ECDFS)-currently the deepest contiguous
   component of the NuSTAR extragalactic survey program. The survey covers
   the full approximate to 30' x 30' area of this field to a maximum depth
   of approximate to 360 ks (approximate to 220 ks when corrected for
   vignetting at 3-24 keV), reaching sensitivity limits of approximate to
   1.3 x 10(-14) erg s(-1) cm(-2) (3-8 keV), approximate to 3.4 x 10(-14)
   erg s(-1) cm(-2) (8-24 keV), and approximate to 3.0 x 10(-14) erg s(-1)
   cm(-2) (3-24 keV). A total of 54 sources are detected over the full
   field, although five of these are found to lie below our significance
   threshold once contaminating flux from neighboring (i.e., blended)
   sources is taken into account. Of the remaining 49 that are significant,
   19 are detected in the 8-24 keV band. The 8-24 to 3-8 keV band ratios of
   the 12 sources that are detected in both bands span the range 0.39-1.7,
   corresponding to a photon index range of Gamma approximate to 0.5-2.3,
   with a median photon index of (Gamma) over bar = 1.70 +/- 0.52. The
   redshifts of the 49 sources in our main sample span the range z =
   0.21-2.7, and their rest-frame 10-40 keV luminosities (derived from the
   observed 8-24 keV fluxes) span the range L10-40 keV (0.7-300) 10 erg
   s(-1), sampling below the ``knee{''} of the X-ray luminosity function
   out to z similar to 0.8-1. Finally, we identify one NuSTAR source that
   has neither a Chandra nor an XMM-Newton counterpart, but that shows
   evidence of nuclear activity at infrared wavelengths and thus may
   represent a genuine, new X-ray source detected by NuSTAR in the ECDFS.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescence properties of materials are closely related to their
   crystal structures and growth characteristics. In this study, a series
   of beta-NaYF4:20\% Yb3+, 2\% Er3+ (20 and 2\% represent the reactant
   mole percentage) microcrystals with different morphologies and sizes
   were synthesized using a hydrothermal route. The crystal phase,
   morphology, size, and upconversion luminescence properties of the
   as-prepared samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, field
   emission scanning electron microscopy and photoluminescence analysis,
   respectively. The effects of the precursor solution pH value on the
   upconversion luminescence properties of the beta-NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+
   crystals were investigated in detail. The results indicate that the
   preferential growth plane of the beta-NaYF4 crystals was significantly
   influenced by the precursor pH values. Crystal plane characteristics
   affected the luminescence behavior of beta-NaYF4 in the red and green
   spectral range. In addition, reasonable control of the beta-NaYF4
   crystal growth has a significant effect on the fluorescence lifetime.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The diffculty of access for offshore wind turbines leads to expensive
   and rare opportunities for maintenance. Smart loads management
   (derating) is investigated for the potential to reduce offshore costs of
   energy. Derating refers to altering the rotor angular speed and blade
   pitch to limit loads on damaged rotor blades at the cost of reduced
   power production. The economic benefits of derating wind turbines with
   damaged blades are demonstrated in terms of the potential to avoid full
   shutdown or delay maintenance. High fidelity analysis techniques like 3D
   finite element modeling (FEM) are used alongside beam models of wind
   turbine blades to characterize these strategies in terms of their effect
   to mitigate damage growth. This study considers a common damage type for
   wind turbine blades, the bond line failure, and shows how 3D FEM can be
   used to quantify the effect of operations and control strategies
   designed to extend the fatigue life of damaged blades.}},

Abstract = {{In order to properly address the issues of today's global world, the
   importance of engineering students acquiring leadership and professional
   skills has increased tremendously. In fact, leadership is one of the
   basic pillars for global economic development. By immersing oneself in

   teamwork mentality that will be invaluable in the future society. Global
   engineering organizations, such as the Institute of Electrical and
   Electronic Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers,
   and Tau Beta Pi Honor Society, have student chapters that offer
   opportunities to develop those critical leadership skills needed to
   become an essential asset in the problem solving required to keep the
   world progressing to its full potential. Throughout this paper,
   engineering students give the first-person accounts of how becoming a
   leader within their respective organizations has transformed their
   undergraduate degree experience. These students have gone on to
   establish other organizations at Florida Atlantic University that have
   also enhanced the educational experience of other students and
   illustrate the importance of emphasizing leadership skills in the

Abstract = {{A framework is proposed to analyze the impact of both Front End of the
   Line (FEOL) and Back End of the Line (BEOL) wearout mechanisms on
   memories embedded within state-of-art microprocessors. Our methodology
   finds the detailed electrical stress and temperature of each SRAM cell
   within a memory by running a variety of standard benchmarks. Combining
   the stress/thermal profiles and the wearout models, the performance
   degradation of SRAM cells for each wearout mechanism is studied. The
   lifetimes of the SRAM cells are then obtained when the performance
   metric degrades to a predefined threshold. The proposed work introduces
   a method to deal with the large volume of SRAM cells whose stress is
   non-uniform by partitioning the SRAM cells into different stress states,
   and generates the lifetime distribution of the memory system due to each
   wearout mechanism by combining the lifetimes of the cells, whose
   distributions vary with the stress received. Seven wearout mechanisms
   have been studied, namely, negative bias temperature instability (NBTI),
   positive bias temperature instability (PBTI), hot carrier injection
   (HCI), gate oxide breakdown (GOBD), backend dielectric breakdown
   (BTDDB), electromigration (EM), and stress-induced voiding (SIV). (C)

Abstract = {{In DRAMs, stored data on a capacitor tend to leak over time because of
   leakage current To retain data, DRAMs require periodic refresh based on
   a profile of retention time. However, accurate DRAM refresh
   characterization is hindered by variable retention time (VRT) owing to
   random telegraph noise. In this paper, we propose AVERT, a device model
   and circuit simulation methodology for variable retention time in DRAMs.
   Based on the charge trapping and detrapping model, we generate a random
   telegraph signal in trap-induced gate leakage and trap-assisted
   gate-induced drain leakage to model random fluctuations in the retention
   time of DRAMs. With AVERT, we apply a stochastic device model of
   variable retention time to circuit simulation. Our results demonstrate
   the feasibility of simulating DRAM with random telegraph noise in
   leakage current and correspond closely to experimental results from
   prior publications. Based on observations from experimental data, we
   provide some insight into how to optimize the test time per cell and how

Abstract = {{In the nanoscale regime, the aggressive scaling of devices is affected
   by several severe reliability issues, including negative bias
   temperature instability (NBTI) and gate oxide breakdown (GOBD).
   Generally, the mathematical models of NBTI and GOBD are derived from
   device level test structures with accelerated tests. However, although
   both models are highly dependent on temperature and the gate voltage and
   both mechanisms are based on the probability of trap generation in the
   oxide layer, each model has a different impact on circuit performances.
   In this paper, we use a physical probability model of trap generation
   for both mechanisms. We first simulate the impact on circuits using
   process models involving threshold voltage shifts and gate oxide leakage
   currents for NBTI and GOBD, respectively. Then, we find a relationship
   between the model parameters and power/ground signal degradation. We
   find the stress conditions that make each of the two mechanisms dominant
   in the power/ ground signal. We calibrate the NBTI and GOBD model
   parameters of each chip to experimental results. Hence, it becomes
   possible to identify chips that are more or less vulnerable to NBTI and
   GOBD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As CMOS technology scales, frontend wearout mechanisms, such as bias
   temperature instability, hot-carrier injection, and gate oxide breakdown
   significantly degrade transistor performance. We investigate the impact
   of these frontend wearout mechanisms on embedded DRAM cells, which are
   used for last-level caches owing to their high-density characteristics.
   Our results show that a cell transistor of eDRAM is more susceptible to
   gate oxide breakdown than bias temperature instability and hot-carrier
   injection. The impact of all such wearout mechanisms on a cell capacitor
   is negligible. Based on observations from our simulations, which
   estimate the performance degradation of eDRAMs resulting from frontend
   wearout mechanisms, we propose monitoring methods to proactively detect
   the failures of eDRAMs caused by frontend wearout mechanisms. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Prevention of seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemics relies on
   widespread vaccination coverage to induce protective immunity. In
   addition to a good antigenic match with the circulating viruses, the
   effectiveness of individual strains represented in the trivalent
   vaccines depends on their immunogenicity. In this study, we evaluated
   the immunogenicity of H1N1, H3N2, and B seasonal influenza virus vaccine
   strains delivered individually with a novel dissolving microneedle patch
   and the stability of this formulation during storage at 25 degrees C.
   Our data demonstrate that all strains retained their antigenic activity
   after incorporation in the dissolving patches as measured by single
   radial diffusion (SRID) assay and immune responses to vaccination in
   BALB/c mice. After a single immunization, all three antigens delivered
   with microneedle patches induced superior neutralizing antibody titers
   compared to intramuscular immunization. Cutaneous antigen delivery was
   especially beneficial for the less immunogenic B strain. Mice immunized
   with dissolving microneedle patches encapsulating influenza
   A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) vaccine were fully protected against lethal
   challenge by homologous mouse-adapted influenza virus. All vaccine
   components retained activity during storage at room temperature for at
   least 3 months as measured in vitro by SRID assay and in vivo by mouse
   immunization studies. Our data demonstrate that dissolving microneedle
   patches are a promising advance for influenza cutaneous vaccination due
   to improved immune responses using less immunogenic influenza antigens
   and enhanced stability.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in soil moisture content alter the load on underlying material,
   and we have developed a technique for characterizing this effect by
   using an extensometer to measure the displacement caused by the load
   change. The extensometer is pushed into soil at depths of 5 m or more,
   and displacement between two anchors separated by similar to 1.5 m is
   measured with a resolution of better than 0.01 mu m (10(-8) m). The
   instrument is sensitive to load changes at the ground surface within a
   radial distance that is roughly twice its depth, potentially providing a
   method for averaging changes in water content over hundreds of m(2) or
   more. During a field trial at a site in South Carolina, compressive
   displacements in unsaturated saprolite were strongly correlated to
   rainfall with a calibration factor of 0.16 mu m displacement per mm of
   rainfall +/- 0.002 mu m/mm (R-2 = 0.95). Estimates of the net change in
   water volume per unit area made using the calibration factor from
   rainfall were similar to independent estimates of evapotranspiration.
   The technique was affected by barometric pressure variations, but the
   sensitivity was less than expected and does not hinder meaningful
   application. A companion instrument demonstrated the displacement signal
   was repeatable.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic cycle is an exquisitely coordinated and balanced
   interaction between the atmosphere, the ocean, and the land that
   controls, among other things, the planet's temperature by moving large
   quantities of matter and energy. The system is incredibly complex with a
   myriad of positive and negative feedbacks acting at a variety of scales.
   Much of what we experience in our natural and altered environments
   results from these complex interactions. Surprisingly (or maybe not)
   this complexity many times results in beautifully organized expressions
   of the hydrologic state that are commonly amenable to fairly simple
   explanations. This paper illustrates hydrologic complexity and
   organization in the context of the author's and collaborator's work
   during the past decades, a lot published in Water Resources Research.
   Topics include the impact of soil moisture on the atmosphere and vice
   versa, the impact of deforestation on the Amazon cloud climate and
   precipitation, the estimation of surface energy and mass fluxes, the
   self-organization of landscapes and river basins over very long time
   periods, and the roles of vegetation on landscape evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The sampling of the bacterial signal transduction is investigated for
   molecular communication (MC). It is assumed that the finite-duration
   amplitude modulated, i.e., pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM),
   concentration of a certain type of molecule is used for information
   transmission. The bacterial signaling pathway is modified to transduce
   the input molecules to the output signal, i.e., produce green
   fluorescent protein (GFP). The bacterial signal transduction is composed
   of a set of biochemical reactions which impose randomness on the
   response. Therefore, the input-output relation, the timing issues, and
   the noise effects for the bacteria response are characterized based on
   both analytical and experimental observations. Sampling schemes for the
   raw bacteria response are proposed based on the total response duration,
   the peak value, the ramp-up slope, and the ramp-down slope. Each
   sampling scheme is shown to be providing a one-to-one and monotonic
   function of the input. The sampling based on the ramp-up slope is shown
   to be statistically favorable for the detection of PAM molecular
   signals. Accordingly, the time interval selection and non-coherent
   sampling are studied for the efficient calculation of the ramp-up slope
   from the raw bacteria response. This work provides a basis for the
   sampling of the raw bacteria response and enables accurate detection of
   PAM molecular signals via bacterial response for MC and sensing
   applications.}},

   latitude, 25.40 degrees N; geographic longitude, 81.93 degrees E;
   L=1.081), India, during December 2010 to November 2011. The main focus
   of this work is on the correlation between observed low-latitude
   whistlers and lightning activity detected by the World-Wide Lightning
   Location Network near the conjugate point (geography 9.87 degrees S,
   83.59 degrees E) of Allahabad. Whistler occurrence is higher in the
   postmidnight period as compared to the premidnight period. Whistlers
   were observed in the daytime only on 2days that too before 8:30 LT
   (morning). Seasonally, occurrence is maximum during winter months, which
   is due to more lightning activity in the conjugate region and favorable
   ionospheric conditions. About 63\% of whistlers were correlated with
   lightning strokes in the vicinity of the conjugate point within spatial
   extent of 1000km (conjugate area). Most (about 53\%) whistlers were
   found to be associated with lightning strokes that were offset to the
   southeast of the conjugate point. The results indicate that an energy
   range of 7.5-17.5kJ of lightning strokes generate most of whistlers at
   this station. The L shell calculations show that propagation paths of
   the observed whistlers were embedded in the topside ionosphere. Based on
   these results we suggest a possibility of ducted mode of propagation
   even for such very low latitude whistlers.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on quantifying and visualizing the competitive
   dynamics shaping the ICT ecosystem. We ground our study in theories of
   complex systems, strategy dynamics, and industry life cycle. Using a
   unique longitudinal dataset, we define and develop graph and information
   theoretic measures of coopetition, convergence, complexity, and velocity
   of the ICT ecosystem. We frame the ``transformation path{''} of the ICT
   ecosystem using these proposed metrics and map the trajectory using
   complex network visualizations. Our results show that while segments in
   the ICT ecosystem have converged, the rate of convergence is decreasing.
   This suggests a growing maturity of the ecosystem and decreasing
   importance on formal interfirm relationships. At the same time, we find
   that coopetition is increasing at a decreasing rate. We also find
   evidence of a declining engagement in interfirm R\&D and a growing
   number of technology transfer relationships, indicating a possible shift
   from value exploration to value capturing. Our novel data-based metrics
   provide a foundation for strategic analysis of new business
   opportunities that is not possible using traditional market analysis
   tools. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and future
   research opportunities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents measurements and statistical characterization of
   300- to 320-GHz desktop channels. The measurements are performed in
   line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) environments. From the large set
   of LoS measured data, the parameters for the single-slope path-loss
   model with shadowing are devised. The results show that the path-loss
   exponent is around 1.9 and that the variations due to shadowing are
   similar across different frequencies and different bandwidths.
   Furthermore, the impact of different materials on the path loss is
   studied in the NLoS environment. The results show that metal objects in
   the propagation path cause multiple strong reflections, leading to a
   higher path loss. Furthermore, the statistical analysis of multipath
   propagation is performed. The root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, the
   mean excess delay, the maximum excess delay, and the coherence bandwidth
   for LoS and NLoS environments are calculated. The results show that the
   mean excess delay and RMS delay spread increase with distance and that
   the RMS delay spread in the desktop terahertz channel is much smaller
   than that in typical indoor ultrawideband channels. In addition, the
   power delay profiles for LoS and NLoS environments are analyzed. The
   results show that strong reflections from the transmitter and receiver
   electronics are present in both LoS and NLoS environments. Finally, the
   statistical analysis of the measured signal amplitude in LoS and NLoS
   environments is performed. For both LoS and NLoS propagation
   environments, it is found that the lognormal distribution provides the
   best fit.}},

Abstract = {{A geometry-based propagation model is proposed for wide-band polarized
   body area network ( BAN) channels. Reflection coefficient functions
   (Gamma-functions) are derived as a function of geometry-based channel
   modeling parameters for more precise modeling of polarized BAN channels

   coefficients or use constant-valued reflection coefficients.
   Conservation-of-polarization (CoP) propagation planes along with
   geometrical Gamma-functions, which we call the CoP-Gamma plane
   methodology, are used to derive the channel polarization functions.
   Statistical characteristics of polarized BAN channels such as the
   cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and time-frequency correlation
   function (TF-CF) are provided based on this new CoP-Gamma plane
   methodology. The model is validated with measurement data taken at 13

Abstract = {{Membrane receptor-ligand interactions mediate many cellular functions.
   Binding kinetics and downstream signaling triggered by these molecular
   interactions are likely affected by the mechanical environment in which
   binding and signaling take place. A recent study demonstrated that
   mechanical force can regulate antigen recognition by and triggering of
   the T-cell receptor (TCR). This was made possible by a new technology we
   developed and termed fluorescence biomembrane force probe (fBFP), which
   combines single-molecule force spectroscopy with fluorescence
   microscopy. Using an ultra-soft human red blood cell as the sensitive
   force sensor, a high-speed camera and real-time imaging tracking
   techniques, the fBFP is of similar to 1 pN (10(-12) N), similar to 3 nm
   and similar to 0.5 msec in force, spatial and temporal resolution. With
   the fBFP, one can precisely measure single receptor-ligand binding
   kinetics under force regulation and simultaneously image
   binding-triggered intracellular calcium signaling on a single live cell.
   This new technology can be used to study other membrane receptor-ligand
   interaction and signaling in other cells under mechanical regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Green fluorescent protein and related proteins carry chromophores formed
   within the protein from their own amino acids. Corresponding synthetic
   compounds are nonfluorescent in solution due to photoinduced
   isomerization of the benzylideneimidiazolidinone core. Restriction of
   this internal rotation by binding to host molecules leads to pronounced,
   up to three orders of magnitude, increase of fluorescence intensity.
   This property allows using GFP chromophore analogs as fluorogenic dyes
   to detect metal ions, proteins, nucleic acids, and other hosts. For
   example, RNA aptamer named Spinach, which binds to and activates
   fluorescence of some GFP chromophores, was proved to be a unique label
   for live-cell imaging of specific RNAs, endogenous metabolites and
   target proteins. Chemically locked GFP chromophores are brightly
   fluorescent and represent potentially useful dyes due to their small
   size and high water solubility.}},

Abstract = {{The limited band of optical and electrical devices in an
   intensity-modulation direct detection (IM/DD) system is considered to be
   a major bottleneck that hinders the increase in transmission capacity.
   Spectrally efficient modulation formats and advanced digital signal
   processing are key technologies to improving the performance of IM/DD
   for high-speed short-reach optical systems. In this paper, we propose
   and experimentally demonstrate a novel Nyquist eight-level,
   pulse-amplitude, single-carrier modulation with frequency-domain
   equalization (PAM8-SCFDE). In addition, 40-GBd Nyquist PAM8-SCFDE
   signals can be successfully transmitted over 2-km standard single-mode
   fiber or 20-km large effective area fiber based on 10-G-class DAC and
   photodiode. Therefore, the achieved aggregate data rate is 120 Gb/s, and
   the measured bit error rate (BER) is under 7\%
   pre-forward-error-correction (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3). Compared
   with conventional PAM8, this scheme can provide double spectral
   efficiency and 6-dB receiver sensitivity improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation processing of ocean noise can be used to develop totally
   passive ocean monitoring methods. Using various hydrophone pair
   orientations, this study investigates the frequency dependence, seasonal
   variability, and emergence rate of coherent arrivals from
   cross-correlations of low frequency ambient noise (f < 40 Hz) recorded
   on triangular hydrophones arrays. These arrays are located at five
   existing hydroacoustic stations of the International Monitoring System
   (IMS), situated in the deep-sound channel, and distributed across the
   Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins. For the majority of studied
   sites, persistent and fast-emerging coherent arrivals are reliably
   obtained if the axis connecting the selected hydrophone pair has a
   direct line-of-sight with regions of the globe containing stable and
   diffuse noise sources (e.g., polar-ice or seismic noise). Furthermore,
   for this favorable orientation, the emergence rate of coherent arrivals
   extracted between hydrophone pairs separated by long ranges (here
   similar to 130 km) can be approximated based on measurements made
   between hydrophone pairs separated by short ranges (similar to 2 km) in
   the Atlantic Ocean. Hence, results from this study, obtained using
   existing hydrophone configurations of the IMS hydroacoustic stations,
   could be used to guide the placement of other hydrophone arrays over the
   globe for future long-range passive ocean monitoring experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a framework for proving approximation limits of polynomial
   size linear programs (LPs) from lower bounds on the nonnegative ranks of
   suitably defined matrices. This framework yields unconditional
   impossibility results that are applicable to any LP as opposed to only
   programs generated by hierarchies. Using our framework, we prove that
   O(n(1/2-is an element of))-approximations for CLIQUE require LPs of size
   2(n Omega(is an element of)). This lower bound applies to LPs using a
   certain encoding of CLIQUE as a linear optimization problem. Moreover,
   we establish a similar result for approximations of semidefinite
   programs by LPs.
   Our main technical ingredient is a quantitative improvement of
   Razborov's {[}38] rectangle corruption lemma for the high error regime,
   which gives strong lower bounds on the nonnegative rank of shifts of the
   unique disjointness matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The article demonstrates that computational modeling has the capacity to
   convert metabolic snapshots, taken sequentially over time, into a
   description of cellular, dynamic strategies. The specific application is
   a detailed analysis of a set of actions with which Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae responds to heat stress. Using time dependent metabolic
   concentration data, we use a combination of mathematical modeling,
   reverse engineering, and optimization to infer dynamic changes in enzyme
   activities within the sphingolipid pathway. The details of the
   sphingolipid responses to heat stress are important, because they guide
   some of the longer-term alterations in gene expression, with which the
   cells adapt to the increased temperature. The analysis indicates that
   all enzyme activities in the system are affected and that the shapes of
   the time trends in activities depend on the fatty-acyl CoA chain lengths
   of the different ceramide species in the system.}},

   HPMC, the interactions between SF and HPMC in the blend films induced
   the conformation transition of SF from random coil form or silk I to
   beta-sheet structure or silk II form. The SF/HPMC blend films are
   flexible, and showed enhanced mechanical properties also the thermal

Abstract = {{Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are widely studied in
   vertebrate systems and are known to play a key role in development,
   plasticity, and regulation of cortical circuitry. The mechanistic
   details of this role are still elusive, but increasingly central to the
   investigation is the homeostatic balance between network excitation and
   inhibition. Studying a simpler neuronal circuit may prove advantageous
   for discovering the mechanistic details of the cellular effects of
   CSPGs. In this study we used a well-established model of homeostatic
   change after injury in the crab Cancer borealis to show first evidence
   that CSPGs are necessary for network activity homeostasis. We degraded
   CSPGs in the pyloric circuit of the stomatogastric ganglion with the
   enzyme chondroitinase ABC (chABC) and found that removal of CSPGs does
   not influence the ongoing rhythm of the pyloric circuit but does limit
   its capacity for recovery after a networkwide perturbation. Without
   CSPGs, the postperturbation rhythm is slower than in controls and rhythm
   recovery is delayed. In addition to providing a new model system for the
   study of CSPGs, this study suggests a wider role for CSPGs, and perhaps
   the extracellular matrix in general, beyond simply plastic
   reorganization (as observed in mammals) and into a foundational
   regulatory role of neural circuitry.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of oppositely charged emulsion droplets}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We study the dynamics of two pinned droplets under the influence of an
   applied electric stress. We find that at a sufficiently strong field,
   this stress is sufficient to induce contact of the droplets.
   Interestingly, upon such contact, the dynamic behavior sensitively
   depends on the separation distance between the droplets. Besides the
   classical ``coalescence{''} regime, we identify two other dynamic
   regimes: ``fuse-and-split{''} and ``periodic non-coalescence.{''} In the
   ``fuse-and-split{''} regime, the droplets first fuse to form a jet,
   which subsequently breaks up into two droplets. In the ``periodic
   non-coalescence{''} regime, the droplets contact and bounce away
   periodically without coalescence. Further analysis indicates that while
   the electric stress stretches the droplets into shapes that depend on
   the initial droplet separation, the surface tension stress dominates
   over the electric stress as soon as the droplets touch. We show that the
   shapes of the contacting droplets determine their subsequent dynamics.
   Our work provides a rationale for understanding the interplay between
   surface tension and electric stresses that govern the behavior of
   charged droplets and could inspire new methods for characterizing
   emulsion stability and surfactant performance. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Bone remodeling or orthodontic treatment is usually a long-term process.
   It is highly desirable to speed up the process for effective medical
   treatment. In this work, a self-powered low-level laser cure system for
   osteogenesis is developed using the power generated by the triboelectric
   nanogenerator. It is found that the system significantly accelerated the
   mouse embryonic osteoblasts' proliferation and differentiation, which is
   essential for bone and tooth healing. The system is further demonstrated
   to be driven by a living creature's motions, such as human walking or a
   mouse's breathing, suggesting its practical use as a portable or
   implantable clinical cure for bone remodeling or orthodontic treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Very few studies have reported oriented crystallization of conjugated
   polymers directly in solution. Here, solution crystallization of
   conjugated polymers in a microfluidic system is found to produce tightly
   a-stacked fibers with commensurate improved charge transport
   characteristics. For poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films, processing
   under flow caused exciton bandwidth to decrease from 140 to 25 meV,
   pi-pi stacking distance to decrease from 3.93 to 3.72 angstrom and hole
   mobility to increase from an average of 0.013 to 0.16 cm(2) V-1 s(-1),
   vs films spin-coated from pristine, untreated solutions. Variation of
   the flow rate affected thin-film structure and properties, with an
   intermediate flow rate of 0.25 m s(-1) yielding the optimal gr a
   stacking distance and mobility. The flow process included sequential
   cooling followed by low-dose ultraviolet irradiation that promoted
   growth of conjugated polymer fibers. Image analysis coupled with
   mechanistic interpretation supports the supposition that ``tie
   chains{''} provide for charge transport pathways between nanoaggregated
   structures. The ``microfluidic flow enhanced semiconducting polymer
   crystal engineering{''} was also successfully applied to a
   representative electron transport polymer and a nonhalogenated solvent.
   The process can be applied as a general strategy and is expected to
   facilitate the fabrication of high-performance electrically active
   polymer devices.}},

Abstract = {{Using high-quality and polarity-controlled GaN nanowires (NWs), we
   studied the piezotronic effect in crystal orientation defined wurtzite
   structures. By applying a normal compressive force on c-plane GaN NWs
   with an atomic force microscopy tip, the Schottky barrier between the Pt
   tip and GaN can be effectively tuned by the piezotronic effect. In
   contrast, the normal compressive force cannot change the electron
   transport characteristics in m-plane GaN NWs whose piezoelectric
   polarization axis is turned in the transverse direction. This
   observation provided solid evidence for clarifying the difference
   between the piezotronic effect and the piezoresistive effect. We further
   demonstrated a high sensitivity of the m-plane GaN piezotronic
   transistor to collect the transverse force. The integration of c-plane
   GaN and m-plane GaN indicates an overall response to an external force

Title = {{CD163 interacts with TWEAK to regulate tissue regeneration after

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Macrophages are an essential component of the immune response to
   ischaemic injury and play an important role in promoting inflammation
   and its resolution, which is necessary for tissue repair. The type I
   transmembrane glycoprotein CD163 is exclusively expressed on
   macrophages, where it acts as a receptor for haemoglobin: haptoglobin
   complexes. An extracellular portion of CD163 circulates in the blood as
   a soluble protein, for which no physiological function has so far been
   described. Here we show that during ischaemia, soluble CD163 functions
   as a decoy receptor for TWEAK, a secreted pro-inflammatory cytokine of
   the tumour necrosis factor family, to regulate TWEAK-induced activation
   of canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and Notch signalling
   necessary for myogenic progenitor cell proliferation. Mice with deletion
   of CD163 have transiently elevated levels of TWEAK, which stimulate
   muscle satellite cell proliferation and tissue regeneration in their
   ischaemic and non-ischaemic limbs. These results reveal a role for
   soluble CD163 in regulating muscle regeneration after ischaemic injury.}},

Title = {{Mode-selective vibrational modulation of charge transport in organic
   electronic devices}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The soft character of organic materials leads to strong coupling between
   molecular, nuclear and electronic dynamics. This coupling opens the way
   to influence charge transport in organic electronic devices by exciting
   molecular vibrational motions. However, despite encouraging theoretical
   predictions, experimental realization of such approach has remained
   elusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that photoconductivity in a
   model organic optoelectronic device can be modulated by the selective
   excitation of molecular vibrations. Using an ultrafast infrared laser
   source to create a coherent superposition of vibrational motions in a
   pentacene/C-60 photoresistor, we observe that excitation of certain
   modes in the 1,500-1,700 cm(-1) region leads to photocurrent
   enhancement. Excited vibrations affect predominantly trapped carriers.
   The effect depends on the nature of the vibration and its mode-specific
   character can be well described by the vibrational modulation of
   intermolecular electronic couplings. This presents a new tool for
   studying electron-phonon coupling and charge dynamics in (bio) molecular
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Harnessing random micromeso-scale ambient energy is not only clean and
   sustainable, but it also enables self-powered sensors and devices to be
   realized. Here we report a robust and self-powered kinematic vector
   sensor fabricated using highly pliable organic films that can be bent to
   spread over curved and uneven surfaces. The device derives its
   operational energy from a close-proximity triboelectrification of two
   surfaces: a polytetrafluoroethylene film coated with a two-column array
   of copper electrodes that constitutes the mover and a polyimide film
   with the top and bottom surfaces coated with a two-column aligned array
   of copper electrodes that comprises the stator. During relative
   reciprocations, the electrodes in the mover generate electric signals of
   +/- 5V to attain a peak power density of >= 65mWm(-2) at a speed of 0.3
   ms(-1). From our 86,000 sliding motion tests of kinematic measurements,
   the sensor exhibits excellent stability, repeatability and strong signal
   durability.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The presumed ground state of a nematic fluid confined in a cylindrical
   geometry with planar anchoring corresponds to that of an axial
   configuration, wherein the director, free of deformations, is along the
   long axis of the cylinder. However, upon confinement of lyotropic
   chromonic liquid crystals in cylindrical geometries, here we uncover a
   surprising ground state corresponding to a doubly twisted director
   configuration. The stability of this ground state, which involves
   significant director deformations, can be rationalized by the
   saddle-splay contribution to the free energy. We show that sufficient
   anisotropy in the elastic constants drives the transition from a
   deformation-free ground state to a doubly twisted structure, and results
   in spontaneous symmetry breaking with equal probability for either
   handedness. Enabled by the twist angle measurements of the spontaneous
   twist, we determine the saddlesplay elastic constant for chromonic
   liquid crystals for the first time.}},

   silicon substrate is reduced which we ascribe to space charge formation
   at the silicon -organic interface that distorts the field distribution
   in the polymer film during high field poling, and therefore limits the
   effective induced polar order. We demonstrate that the electro-optic
   activity on silicon substrate can be improved by inserting a 5 nm thin
   dielectric layer of Al2O3 between the silicon substrate and the polymer
   which reduces the leak-through current during poling, thereby allowing
   for higher applicable poling voltages. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAEs) are known to promote tumor growth
   and metastasis; however their differential accumulation in invasive and
   noninvasive tumors is not fully understood. We hypothesized that
   differences in cell adhesion may contribute to this phenomenon. To test
   this, we analyzed the adhesion of CAF-precursor fibroblasts and
   mesenchymal stem cells to invasive and noninvasive cancers originating
   from the the breast, ovaries, and prostate. In all cases, stromal cells
   preferentially adhered to more invasive cancer cells. Modulating
   integrin and cadherin binding affinities with calcium chelation revealed
   that adhesion was independent of integrin activity but required cadherin
   function. Invasive cancer cells had increased expression of mesenchymal
   markers cadherin 2 and 11 that localized with stromal,cell cadherin 11,
   suggesting that these molecules are involved in stromal cell
   engraftment. Blockade of cadherin 11 on stromal cells inhibited adhesion
   and may serve as a target for metastatic disease.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The conventional point-particle approach for treating the dispersed
   phase in a continuous flowfield is extended by taking into account the
   effect of finite particle size, using a Gaussian interpolation from
   Lagrangian points to the Eulerian field. The inter-phase exchange terms
   in the conservation equations are distributed over the volume
   encompassing the particle size, as opposed to the Dirac delta function
   generally used in the point-particle approach. The proposed approach is
   benchmarked against three different flow configurations in a numerical
   framework based on large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence closure.
   First, the flow over a circular cylinder is simulated for a Reynolds
   number of 3900 at 1 atm pressure. Results show good agreement with
   experimental data for the mean streamwise velocity and the vortex
   shedding frequency in the wake region. The calculated flowfield exhibits
   correct physics, which the conventional point-particle approach fails to
   capture. The second case deals with diesel jet injection in quiescent
   environment over a pressure range of 1.1-5.0 MPa. The calculated jet
   penetration depth closely matches measurements. It decreases with
   increasing chamber pressure, due to enhanced drag force in a denser
   fluid environment. Finally, water and acetone jet injection normal to
   air crossflow is studied at 1 atm. The calculated jet penetration and
   Sauter mean diameter of liquid droplets compare very well with
   measurements. (C) 2015 The Authors.}},

Abstract = {{In the last several years, many algorithms trying to mimic biological
   processes have been proposed to enhance the performance of communication
   networks. However, the bio-inspired algorithms represent only the very
   first step toward the design of a smart adaptive communication network
   since: 1) they model only a limited set of the rules underlying the
   biological processes, thus, omitting fundamental functionalities; 2)
   they are executed on traditional computer architectures, thus, failing
   to achieve the intrinsic parallelism exhibited by biological processes.
   To overcome these issues, in this paper, the BioNetwork paradigm is
   proposed, a novel communication network paradigm in which the
   traditional network nodes are replaced by living organisms. The
   BioNetwork paradigm provides very attractive features over traditional
   network paradigms, such as efficiency, adaptivity, reliability,
   self-organization, and scalability. Moreover, it has a huge potential
   since it can be adopted in many different applications, such as health
   and military ones. In the paper, this potential is shown by proving that
   a BioNetwork can solve one of the most fundamental NP-hard problems in
   networks, i.e., the Steiner tree problem. To this aim, a BioNetwork
   constituted by a unicellular organism, the Physarum polycephalum slime
   mold, is designed. Throughout the paper, it is proven that a Physarum
   BioNetwork can solve the Steiner tree problem with an exponential
   convergence rate toward the optimal solution. The theoretical solutions
   are validated through a case study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel wet chemical etching method, referred to as
   uniform metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE), for uniform hole
   formation in fabrication of through silicon vias (TSVs) on silicon (Si)
   interposer in wafer level. In MaCE, a layer of Au as catalyst is
   deposited on the photolithography-patterned Si surface. Uniform holes
   are formed by simply immersing the Au-loaded Si into a hydrofluoric
   acid-hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution. In a typical experiment,
   similar to 1 million holes are formed after MaCE for 4 h at room
   temperature over a 4-in Si wafer with a diameter of 28 mu m, a depth of
   162 mu m, a pitch size of 80 mu m, and a sidewall roughness below 50 nm.
   The holes show high geometric uniformity in wafer level, with their
   depth in the range 159-164 mu m, the diameter in 27.1-29.7 mu m, and
   high verticality. Simultaneous etching of two wafers in the same batch
   is also demonstrated. The TSV etched by MaCE show compatibility with
   SiO2 deposition by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and copper
   filling by electroplating. The reported method provides an approach for
   manufacturing TSV on Si interposer with simple operation, high geometric
   uniformity, high throughput, and low cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the thermal performance of glass interposer substrate
   with copper through-package vias ( TPVs) is investigated both
   experimentally and numerically. Copper via arrays with different via
   pitches and diameters were fabricated in 114.3 mm x 114.3 mm x 100 mu m
   glass panels using low-cost laser drilling, electroless plating, and
   electroplating for copper deposition. The thermal performance of such a
   structure was quantified by measuring an effective thermal conductivity
   which combines the effect of copper and glass. The effective thermal
   conductivity of fabricated samples was determined with infrared
   microscopy and compared with finite-element analysis on unit TPV cell.
   Using the effective thermal conductivity, further numerical analyses
   were performed on a 2.5-D interposer, which has two chips mounted side
   by side with a total heat generation of 3 W. Interconnects and TPV
   layers in the interposer were modeled as homogeneous layers with an
   effective thermal conductivity. Using the developed model, the effect of
   copper TPVs on the thermal performance of silicon and glass interposers
   was compared. To further characterize the thermal performance of the
   2.5-D glass interposer structure, the effects of pitch of interconnects
   and TPVs and the TPV diameter are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can improve the net power consumption
   of electronic packages by generating power from the chip waste heat. In
   this paper, a 3-D computational model of electronic package with silicon
   nanowire (Si-NW)-based embedded TEGs has been developed and the effect
   of crucial geometric parameters, contact resistances, and thermal
   properties, such as pitch length and length of Si-NWs, the electrical
   contact resistivity at Si-NW interface, thermal contact resistivity at
   TEG-package interface, and filling material thermal conductivity on
   power generation, has been evaluated. The analysis has shown how
   modifying some crucial parameters from their current values in different
   experimental studies affect power generation, e.g., decreasing the pitch
   length from 400 to 200 nm doubled the power generation, increasing the
   Si-NW length from 1 to 8 mu m increased power generation by a factor of
   three and decreasing contact resistivity by one order of magnitude from
   1.0 x 10(-11) Omega . m(2) enhanced the power generation by a factor of
   two. This paper has estimated the energy conversion efficiency of 0.15\%
   for 8-mu m long Si-NWs using the best thermoelectric properties
   available from different experimental studies. Finally, performance of
   Si-NW-based TEG has been compared against the Bi2Te3 superlattice-based
   TEGs and the crucial parameters of Si-NW TEGs have been identified which
   should be the focus of the future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Network resources are essential in resource critical environments as ad
   hoc wireless networks (AWNs) due to their dynamic topology and
   broadcasting of packets over the wireless medium without a central

   designed for low consumed resources such as low power consumption. In
   this paper focus on ad hoc routing protocols, Optimized Link State
   Routing Protocol (OLSR) and gossip-based routing protocols, based on
   selective forwarding node algorithms that reduce the control message
   overheads. Thus, we present performance analytical results to thoroughly
   evaluate the routing protocols and demonstrate our Adaptive-Gossiping

Abstract = {{Solar electricity production is considered in an Air Brayton cycle with
   an integrated two-step thermochemical cycle for heat storage based on
   Co3O4/CoO redox reactions. The two steps of the heat storage cycle are
   encompassed by (1) the high-temperature thermolysis of Co3O(4) to CoO
   and O-2 under vacuum pressure utilizing concentrated solar irradiation
   for process heat; and (2) the highly exothermic re-oxidation of CoO with
   O-2 at elevated pressures, resulting in Co3O4 and providing the heat
   input to the Air Brayton cycle. The two steps may be decoupled, enabling
   long-term storage of heat (i.e., thermochemical storage of sunlight). A
   thermodynamic analysis is applied to determine cycle efficiencies over a
   range of operating parameters, and an exergy analysis is used to
   identify the major sources of irreversibilities. A maximum cycle
   efficiency of 44\% was determined for re-oxidizing the CoO at 30 bar,
   with the maximum cycle efficiency reducing to 26\% for a decrease in
   pressure to 5 bar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation on the dynamic-stall-suppression capabilities of
   combustion-powered actuation applied to a tabbed VR-12 airfoil is
   presented. In the first section, the results from the computational
   fluid dynamics simulations carried out at Mach numbers of 0.3 and 0.4
   are presented. Several geometric parameters are varied, including the
   slot chordwise location and angle. Actuation-pulse amplitude, frequency,
   and timing are also varied. The two-dimensional simulations suggest that
   cycle-averaged lift increases of approximately 4 and 8\% with respect to
   the baseline airfoil are possible at Mach numbers of 0.4 and 0.3 for
   deep and near-deep dynamic-stall conditions. In the second section, the
   static-stall results from low-speed wind-tunnel experiments are
   presented. The low-speed experiments and high-speed computational fluid
   dynamics suggest that slots oriented tangential to the airfoil surface
   produce stronger benefits than slots oriented normal to the chord line.
   The low-speed experiments confirm that chordwise slot locations suitable
   for Mach 0.3-0.4 stall suppression (based on computational fluid
   dynamics) will also be effective at lower Mach numbers.}},

Title = {{Rapid homogeneous endothelialization of high aspect ratio microvascular
   networks}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microvascularization of an engineered tissue construct is necessary to
   ensure the nourishment and viability of the hosted cells. Microvascular
   constructs can be created by seeding the luminal surfaces of
   microfluidic channel arrays with endothelial cells. However, in a
   conventional flow-based system, the uniformity of endothelialization of
   such an engineered microvascular network is constrained by mass transfer
   of the cells through high length-to-diameter (L/D) aspect ratio
   microchannels. Moreover, given the inherent limitations of the initial
   seeding process to generate a uniform cell coating, the large
   surface-area-to-volume ratio of microfluidic systems demands long
   culture periods for the formation of confluent cellular microconduits.
   In this report, we describe the design of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   and poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS) microvascular constructs with
   reentrant microchannels that facilitates rapid, spatially homogeneous
   endothelial cell seeding of a high L/D (2 cm/35 mu m; > 550: 1) aspect
   ratio microchannels. MEMS technology was employed for the fabrication of
   a monolithic, elastomeric, reentrant microvascular construct. Isotropic
   etching and PDMS micromolding yielded a near-cylindrical microvascular
   channel array. A `stretch - seed - seal' operation was implemented for
   uniform incorporation of endothelial cells along the entire
   microvascular area of the construct yielding endothelialized
   microvascular networks in less than 24 h. The feasibility of this
   endothelialization strategy and the uniformity of cellularization were
   established using confocal microscope imaging.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of a twice-accelerated Richtmyer Meshkov
   instability, where reshock provides the second acceleration, focusing on
   the effects of initial conditions and circulation deposition is
   presented. Experiments were performed using the inclined shock tube
   facility at the Shock Tube and Advanced Mixing Laboratory. Three
   experimental cases are presented that have the same Atwood number,
   inclination angle, and Mach number, but are differentiated by their
   pre-reshock development time. Both Mie scattering and particle image
   velocimetry diagnostics were implemented. Velocity statistics were
   ensemble-averaged over instantaneous realizations for each case before
   and after reshock. Results show that while the mix width decreases after
   reshock, the interface length continues to increase because the reshock
   wave amplifies smallscale perturbations on the pre-reshock interface,
   resulting in greater mixing. A more developed interface also experiences
   greater circulation deposition after reshock. After reshock, the sign of
   the vorticity near the interface reverses due to a second application of
   baroclinic torque by the reshock wave. Velocity statistics showed that
   the crosscorrelation ((u,v) over bar) is nonzero over much of the mixing
   layer, which indicates that shear and anisotropy are present. Turbulent
   kinetic energy spectra for the most developed case after reshock
   exhibited a k(-5/3) inertial range.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz (THz) communication is envisioned as a key technology for
   next-generation ultra-high-speed wireless systems. In this paper, we
   study an indoor multi-user THz communication system with multiple
   antenna subarrays. To capture the distance-frequency-dependent
   characteristics of THz channels, we design a hybrid beamforming scheme
   with distance-aware multi-carrier transmission, including analog
   beamforming for user grouping and interference cancellation in
   radio-frequency (RF) domain and digital beamforming with dynamically
   selected subarrays at baseband. Specifically, an adaptive power
   allocation and low-complexity antenna subarray selection policy is
   developed to serve different users at different distances and reduce the
   cost of active RF circuits simultaneously, where two greedy subarray
   selection algorithms are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed
   adaptive hybrid beamforming and antenna subarray selection algorithms is
   verified through simulation results, which achieves significant gains
   over other nonadaptive and non-distance-aware schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The detrimental impacts of climate variability on water, agriculture,
   and food resources in East Africa underscore the importance of reliable
   seasonal climate predictions. This study compares several forecasting
   methods using sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to predict East
   African rains with various lead times. It is shown that the forecasts
   can explain more than 50\% of the short rains (boreal autumn) variance
   across large regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and reaffirm the
   importance of the Walker-like circulation over the Indian Ocean. The
   forecasts also explain more than 50\% of the long rains (boreal spring)
   over Uganda, Lake Victoria, and western Kenya, and demonstrate the
   strong connection of the long rains to the SSTs in the southern Atlantic
   Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea.
   For the unimodal rains in Tanzania, the forecasts explain more than 40\%
   of the rainfall variance over northwestern Tanzania based on SST
   predictors in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the subtropical North
   Atlantic. For the South Sudan and Ethiopian Kiremt rains, the forecast
   skill is less pronounced. The predictor regions (dipoles) for a recently
   developed method are validated through composite maps of surface and
   atmospheric reanalysis variables. Lastly, 2010-2011 forecasts for both
   the long and short rains demonstrate skill in predicting the recent
   drought suggesting that seasonal climate forecasts can inform natural
   disaster preparedness and water resources planning in East Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Processes exhibiting diversity and selection would have been necessary
   to promote chemical evolution on early Earth. In this work, a model
   process was developed using non-kinetic selection to synthesize and
   isolate small molecule imidazolium catalysts. These catalysts were
   purified by affinity chromatography and recycled back into the process,
   forming a product feedback loop. In dimethylformamide, the catalysts
   activated the coupling of formaldehyde to short chain sugars. This sugar
   mixture was reacted with aniline, acetic acid, and paraformaldehyde to
   generate new catalysts. Thus chemical diversity was produced through
   non-selective, multi-component synthesis. Applying sequential
   dilution-reaction-purification cycles it was demonstrated that this
   process can function independently of starting catalyst. Over three
   process cycles, the initiator catalyst is effectively diluted out as a
   new catalyst population emerges to take its place. This system offers an
   alternative viewpoint for chemical evolution via the generation of small
   molecule organocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the acoustic gaits-the natural human gait quantitative
   characteristics derived from the sound of footsteps as the person walks
   normally. We introduce the acoustic gait profile, which is obtained from
   temporal signal analysis of sound of footsteps collected by microphones
   and illustrate some of the spatio-temporal gait parameters that can be
   extracted from the acoustic gait profile by using three temporal signal
   analysis methods-the squared energy estimate, Hilbert transform and
   Teager-Kaiser energy operator. Based on the statistical analysis of the
   parameter estimates, we show that the spatio-temporal parameters and
   gait characteristics obtained using the acoustic gait profile can
   consistently and reliably estimate a subset of clinical and biometric
   gait parameters currently in use for standardized gait assessments. We
   conclude that the Teager-Kaiser energy operator provides the most
   consistent gait parameter estimates showing the least variation across
   different sessions and zones. Acoustic gaits use an inexpensive set of
   microphones with a computing device as an accurate and unintrusive gait
   analysis system. This is in contrast to the expensive and intrusive
   systems currently used in laboratory gait analysis such as the force
   plates, pressure mats and wearable sensors, some of which may change the
   gait parameters that are being measured.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac-computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a minimally invasive
   imaging technology for characterizing coronary arteries. A fundamental
   limitation of CTA imaging is cardiac movement, which can cause artifacts
   and reduce the quality of the obtained images. To mitigate this problem,
   current approaches involve gating the image based on the
   electrocardiogram (ECG) to predict the timing of quiescent periods of
   the cardiac cycle. This paper focuses on developing a foundation for
   using a mechanical alternative to the ECG for finding these quiescent
   periods: the seismocardiogram (SCG). SCG was used to determine
   beat-by-beat systolic and diastolic quiescent periods of the cardiac
   cycle for nine healthy subjects, and 11 subjects with various
   cardiovascular diseases. To reduce noise in the SCG, and quantify these
   quiescent periods, a Kalman filter was designed to extract the velocity
   of chest wall movement from the recorded SCG signals. The average
   systolic and diastolic quiescent periods were centered at 29\% and 76\%
   for the healthy subjects, and 33\% and 79\% for subjects with
   cardiovascular disease. Both inter and intrasubject variability in the
   quiescent phases were observed compared to ECG-predicted phases,
   suggesting that the ECG may be a suboptimal modality for predicting
   quiescence, and that the SCG provides complementary data to the ECG.}},

Abstract = {{Motion control for uncertain mechanical systems is considered. Emphasis
   is on constraint following, while the constraint may be redundant. The
   uncertainty in the system, which is (possibly) fast time varying, is
   bounded. The bound is unknown but is assumed to be within a prescribed
   fuzzy set. An adaptive robust control is proposed based on the fuzzy
   property of the uncertainty. Both the mechanical system and the control
   are deterministic and, hence, not IF-THEN fuzzy rule based. The
   performance of the resulting controlled system is twofold. First, some
   deterministic performance is guaranteed, regardless of the value of the
   uncertainty. Second, the minimization of a fuzzy-based performance index
   is guaranteed based on an optimal choice of a control design parameter.
   The effectiveness of the design procedure is illustrated by the
   simulation control of a digging excavator.}},

Abstract = {{Emitter sheet resistance contributes significantly to the distributed
   series resistance of a solar cell. The series resistance (R-s) impacts
   the fill factor (FF) and in turn affects the short-circuit current

   understand the properties of the emitter in order to achieve excellent
   ohmic contact. In this study, an analytical modeling of the dependence
   of open-circuit voltage (V-oc), J(sc), FF, and efficiency of a silicon
   solar cell on emitter sheet resistance was carried out. In order to
   better evaluate R-s based on various metal grid designs, different grid
   models were used to investigate the resistive losses. And the one having
   the best match with the reference cell was incorporated in the
   simulation. It was found that for a typical three-bus-bar screen-printed
   silicon solar cell, the emitter sheet resistance should be in the 70-90

   ectonucleotide tri(di)phosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPD1, also known as CD39) on
   the surface of leukocytes and endothelial cells metabolizes locally
   released, intravascular ATP and ADP, thereby eliminating these
   prothrombotic and proinflammatory stimuli. Here, we evaluated the
   contribution of CD39 to atherogenesis in the apolipoprotein E deficient
   (ApoE-deficient) mouse model of atherosclerosis. Compared with control
   ApoE-deficient animals, plaque burden was markedly increased along with
   circulating markers of platelet activation in Cd39(+/-)Apoe(-/-) mice
   fed a high-fat diet. Plaque analysis revealed stark regionalization of
   endothelial CD39 expression and function in Apoe(-/-) mice, with CD39
   prominently expressed in atheroprotective, stable flow regions and
   diminished in atheroprone areas subject to disturbed flow. In mice,
   disturbed flow as the result of partial carotid artery ligation rapidly
   suppressed endothelial CD39 expression. Moreover, unidirectional laminar
   shear stress induced atheroprotective CD39 expression in human
   endothelial cells. CD39 induction was dependent upon the vascular
   transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) binding near the
   transcriptional start site of CD39. Together, these data establish CD39
   as a regionalized regulator of atherogenesis that is driven by shear
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional integrated circuit packages with through-silicon vias
   (TSVs) provide a good solution to the integration of different chips and
   help achieve high performance. The signals are transmitted to different
   layers directly through the vias, thereby enabling the high performance
   of the chips. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-deposited SiO2, polyimide,
   and benzo-cyclo-butene are commonly used as the passivation layer for
   three-dimensional packages. In the 3D stacked chips, mismatch of the
   coefficient of thermal expansion between the passivation material and
   silicon will generate thermal/mechanical stress in the metal trace and
   the stress affects the behavior of electromigration. However, few
   studies have examined the relationship among the external mechanical
   stress and critical product of electromigration. In the present study,
   external stress is applied to the aluminum thin film by a four-point
   bending equipment. In order to apply higher external stress in the
   aluminum thin film, the fracture strength of the silicon substrate
   should be improved. Reduces the edge chipping of the test sample is a
   key factor for improving the fracture strength of the silicon substrate
   and a special cutting approach is employed to obtain higher silicon
   strength. A two-step cutting method is applied to reduce front side
   chipping and also a dicing before grinding approachis adopted to reduce
   backside chipping, the above-mentioned technology can enable more than
   275MPa of external stress on the aluminum thin film and can make the
   critical length effect more visible. The residual stress of the aluminum
   thin film is at stress-free state after annealing at 300 degrees C for
   10h. The critical product is found to be reduced from 1,294A/cm to
   1,281A/cm when 120MPa of mechanical tensile stress is applied. It
   increased to 1,315A/cm under 120MPa of mechanical compressive stress.
   Clearly, electromigration behavior is enhanced by tensile stress and
   decreased by compressive stress. In the current research, a modified
   equation for Blech condition is proposed with a stress-dependent.
   effective charge number, the effective charge number increased when
   tensile stress was applied and decreased when compressive stress was
   applied.}},

Abstract = {{To more accurately model microcantilever resonant behavior in liquids
   and to improve lateral-mode sensor performance, a new model is developed
   to incorporate viscous fluid effects and Timoshenko beam effects (shear
   deformation, rotatory inertia). The model is motivated by studies
   showing that the most promising geometries for lateral-mode sensing are
   those for which Timoshenko effects are most pronounced. Analytical
   solutions for beam response due to harmonic tip force and electrothermal
   loadings are expressed in terms of total and bending displacements,
   which correspond to laser and piezoresistive readouts, respectively. The
   influence of shear deformation, rotatory inertia, fluid properties, and
   actuation/detection schemes on resonant frequencies (f(res)) and quality
   factors (Q) are examined, showing that Timoshenko beam effects may
   reduce fres and Q by up to 40\% and 23\%, respectively, but are
   negligible for width-to-length ratios of 1/10 and lower. Comparisons
   with measurements (in water) indicate that the model predicts the
   qualitative data trends, but underestimates the softening that occurs in
   stiffer specimens, indicating that support deformation becomes a factor.
   For thinner specimens, the model estimates Q quite well, but exceeds the
   observed values for thicker specimens, showing that the Stokes
   resistance model employed should be extended to include pressure effects
   for these geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Wnt5a and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 {[}1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3]
   regulate endochondral ossification. 1a,25 (OH)(2)D-3 initiates its
   calcium-dependent effects via its membrane-associated receptor, protein
   disulfide isomerase A3 (Pdia3). 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 binding to Pdia3
   triggers the interaction between Pdia3 and phospholipase A(2)
   (PLA(2))-activating protein (PLAA), resulting in downstream activation
   of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), PLA(2), and
   protein ldnase C (PKC). Wnt5a initiates its calcium-dependent effects
   via binding its receptors Frizzled2 (FZD2) and Frizzled5 (FZD5) and
   receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), activating
   intracellular calcium release and stimulating PKC and CaMKII. Recent
   efforts to determine the inter-relation between Wnt5a and 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 signaling pathways have demonstrated that Wnt5a
   signals through a CaMKII/PLA(2)/PGE(2)/PKC cascade in chondrocytes and
   osteoblasts in which the components of the Pdia3 receptor complex were
   required. Furthermore, ROR2, but not FZD2 or FZD5, was required to
   mediate the calcium-dependent actions of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. This
   review provides evidence that 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 and Wnt5a mediate
   their calcium-dependent pathways via similar receptor components and
   proposes that these pathways may interact since they are competing for
   the same receptor complex components. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A general framework of noise suppression in material decomposition for
   dual-energy CT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4848-4862}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: As a general problem of dual-energy CT (DECT), noise
   amplification in material decomposition severely reduces the
   signal-to-noise ratio on the decomposed images compared to that on the
   original CT images. In this work, the authors propose a general
   framework of noise suppression in material decomposition for DECT. The
   method is based on an iterative algorithm recently developed in their
   group for image-domain decomposition of DECT, with an extension to
   include nonlinear decomposition models. The generalized framework of
   iterative DECT decomposition enables beamhardening correction with
   simultaneous noise suppression, which improves the clinical benefits of
   DECT.
   Methods: The authors propose to suppress noise on the decomposed images
   of DECT using convex optimization, which is formulated in the form of
   least-squares estimation with smoothness regularization. Based on the
   design principles of a best linear unbiased estimator, the authors
   include the inverse of the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the
   decomposed images as the penalty weight in the least-squares term.
   Analytical formulas are derived to compute the variance-covariance
   matrix for decomposed images with general-form numerical or analytical
   decomposition. As a demonstration, the authors implement the proposed
   algorithm on phantom data using an empirical polynomial function of
   decomposition measured on a calibration scan. The polynomial
   coefficients are determined from the projection data acquired on a wedge
   phantom, and the signal decomposition is performed in the projection
   domain.
   Results: On the Catphan (R) 600 phantom, the proposed noise suppression
   method reduces the average noise standard deviation of basis material
   images by one to two orders of magnitude, with a superior performance on
   spatial resolution as shown in comparisons of line-pair images and
   modulation transfer function measurements. On the synthesized
   monoenergetic CT images, the noise standard deviation is reduced by a
   factor of 2-3. By using nonlinear decomposition on projections, the
   authors' method effectively suppresses the streaking artifacts of beam
   hardening and obtains more uniform images than their previous approach
   based on a linear model. Similar performance of noise suppression is
   observed in the results of an anthropomorphic head phantom and a
   pediatric chest phantom generated by the proposed method. With
   beam-hardening correction enabled by their approach, the image spatial
   nonuniformity on the head phantom is reduced from around 10\% on the
   original CT images to 4.9\% on the synthesized monoenergetic CT image.
   On the pediatric chest phantom, their method suppresses image noise
   standard deviation by a factor of around 7.5, and compared with linear
   decomposition, it reduces the estimation error of electron densities
   from 33.3\% to 8.6\%.
   Conclusions: The authors propose a general framework of noise
   suppression in material decomposition for DECT. Phantom studies have
   shown the proposed method improves the image uniformity and the accuracy
   of electron density measurements by effective beam-hardening correction
   and reduces noise level without noticeable resolution loss. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Understanding homeowners' marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) for
   proximity to public transportation infrastructure is important for
   planning and policy. Naive estimates of MWTP, however, may be biased as
   a result of spatial dependence, spatial correlation, and/or spatially
   endogenous variables. In this paper we discuss a class of spatial
   autoregressive models that control for these spatial effects, and apply
   them to sample data collected for the Atlanta, Georgia housing market.
   We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection
   methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model
   (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general
   methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We
   show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit
   proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative
   to ordinary linear regression. This finding may have implications for
   risk estimations in land value capture forecasts and transportation
   policy decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Significance: Cells communicate with the extracellular matrix (ECM)
   protein fibronectin (Fn) through integrin receptors on the cell surface.
   Controlling integrin-Fn interactions offers a promising approach to
   directing cell behavior, such as adhesion, migration, and
   differentiation, as well as coordinated tissue behaviors such as
   morphogenesis and wound healing.
   Recent Advances: Several different groups have developed recombinant
   fragments of Fn that can control epithelial to mesenchymal transition,
   sequester growth factors, and promote bone and wound healing. It is
   thought that these physiological responses are, in part, due to specific
   integrin engagement. Furthermore, it has been postulated that the
   integrin-binding domain of Fn is a mechanically sensitive switch that
   drives binding of one integrin heterodimer over another.
   Critical Issues: Although computational simulations have predicted the
   mechano-switch hypothesis and recent evidence supports the existence of
   varying strain states of Fn in vivo, experimental evidence of the Fn
   integrin switch is still lacking.
   Future Directions: Evidence of the integrin mechano-switch will enable
   the development of new Fn-based peptides in tissue engineering and wound
   healing, as well as deepen our understanding of ECM pathologies, such as
   fibrosis.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Near-Miss Wrong-Patient Events in Radiology Reports}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{205}},

Pages = {{337-343}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of
   reported near-miss wrong-patient events in radiology at two large
   academic hospitals and its relation to imaging modality, clinical
   setting, and time of occurrence.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. An institutional imaging report database was
   searched for reports between January 1, 2009, and May 30, 2013, that
   contained the phrases ``incorrect patient{''} or ``wrong patient.{''}
   These imaging reports were categorized into either mislabeled or
   misidentified patient or wrong dictation or report events. The
   mislabeling-misidentification events involved patients whose images were
   incorrectly placed in another patient's folder. In wrong dictation or
   report events, a patient's images were placed in the correct imaging
   folder, but another patient's images were used in error for dictation of
   the report. The time to detect each of these events was also evaluated.
   RESULTS. Overall, 67 eligible reports were identified among 1,717,713
   examinations performed during the study period. The estimated event rate
   was 4 per 100,000 examinations (mislabeling-misidentification, 52\%;
   wrong dictation, 48\%). The monthly mean of mislabeling-
   misidentification events was 0.7 (SD, 0.9) and of wrong dictation events
   was 0.6 (SD, 0.7). The median time for mislabeling-misidentification
   reports to be identified was 22 hours and for wrong dictation reports
   was 0 hours. Portable chest radiography was the modality involved in
   69\% (24/35) of reported mislabeling-misidentification and 44\% (14/32)
   of wrong dictation events (p = 0.08); 43\% (15/35) of
   mislabeling-misidentification and 28\% (9/32) of wrong dictation events
   occurred during off hours; 63\% (22/35) of mislabeling-misidentification
   and 56\% (18/32) of wrong dictation events occurred in the inpatient
   setting.
   CONCLUSION. Despite use of the dual-identifier technique mandated by The
   Joint Commission, the number of near-miss mislabeled patient events for
   imaging tests and the delay in awareness of these events were
   substantial, especially for radiography.}},

Abstract = {{The at-rest earth pressure coefficient, , is one of the most fundamental

   Research has been expanded to investigate the correlation between and

   presents the evolution of values of irregularly shaped natural sand,
   spherical shaped smooth and rough surfaced glass beads along with the
   stress history, estimated by the discrete element method. The surface
   roughness and non-spherical particles were emulated by inter-particle
   friction coefficient and the clumped particles. Results exhibit that the
   during loading stage nonlinearly decreases with increasing values of
   friction coefficient and the assemblies with clumped particles present
   the lower values of than spherical particle assemblies of the same
   friction coefficient. The varying friction coefficient seems enough to
   capture the evolution of during loading, unloading and reloading cycles,
   while the natural sand inevitably requires the assembly with clumped
   particles to capture the experimentally observed evolutions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multi-phase sub-harmonic injection locking
   technique. This technique can significantly increase the locking range
   of a multi-phase injection locking oscillator compared to the
   conventional single-phase injection locking scheme. By application of
   this technique, a scalable ``active frequency multiplier{''} chain
   architecture is proposed, which can generate THz signal from a low
   mm-wave frequency or RF reference source. We also propose a multi-ring
   system topology to implement this frequency multiplier scheme. As proof
   of concept, a cascaded 3-stage 3-phase 2nd-order sub-harmonic injection
   locking oscillator chain is implemented in the IBM9HP SiGe BiCMOS
   process with its f(T)/f(max) of 300/350 GHz. The design achieves a
   maximum output power of -16.6 dBm at 498 GHz, a phase noise of -87
   dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, and a total 5.1\% frequency tuning range from
   485.1 GHz to 510.7 GHz, which is the largest frequency tuning range

Abstract = {{Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), which is to apply a minimum amount
   of lubricant directly into the contact zone, is a promising alternative
   to substantially reduce the lubricant cost caused by conventional flood
   cooling. In order to advance the MQL technique into grinding situations,
   understanding of the process and evaluation of the performance is
   necessary. Most documented studies thus far concerning MQL grinding are
   built upon experimental observations with individual and separate
   treatment of grinding performance measures such as grinding force,
   temperature, wheel wear, and surface roughness. This paper develops the
   analytical understanding of mechanical and thermal effects of MQL in
   grinding and profiles the MQL performance as functions of process and
   fluid application parameters. Physics-based predictive models are
   formulated to quantitatively describe the grinding force considering the
   lubrication effect of MQL. The friction coefficient under MQL condition
   is first predicted based on boundary lubrication theory, followed by the
   single grit force and grit distribution analysis. Further, surface
   roughness is calculated from the results of undeformed chip thickness
   distribution through probabilistic analysis. Additionally, energy
   partition and temperature distribution in the workpiece have been
   developed based on the moving heat source model. Material constitutive
   model are utilized to capture the influence of temperature and strain
   rate on the material flow stress. Experimental measurements of force,
   temperature, and surface roughness have also been pursued to calibrate
   and validate the predictive models.}},

Abstract = {{For several reinforcement learning models in strategic-form games,
   convergence to action profiles that are not Nash equilibria may occur

   convergence to non-Nash pure strategy profiles. This approach extends
   prior analysis on reinforcement learning in games that addresses the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose high-capacity spectrally-efficient optical
   mobile fronthaul (MFH) architectures featuring wavelength resource
   sharing, where multiple cell sites share one dense wavelength division
   multiplexing (DWDM) channel instead of occupying a number of separated
   DWDM channels. In the downlink (DL), subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) is
   integrated with DWDM passive optical network. The key technical
   innovation lies in the reception of uplink (UL) signals being optically
   aggregated with ultrasmall spacing. We introduce two novel schemes for
   spectrally-efficient and low-complexity upstream transmissions. The
   first method is based on SCM in remote radio heads (RRHs) and coherent
   detection in baseband units (BBUs), achieving channel spacing of as
   small as 100 MHz. For the first time, successful coherent reception of
   LTE signal, whose symbol rate (15 ksps) is much smaller than the laser
   linewidth, is achieved by pairing a radio frequency pilot tone from each
   RRH. Bidirectional transmission of four 20-MHz 16-QAM-OFDM LTE-like
   signals with 100-MHz spacing aggregated on one wavelength is
   demonstrated. For the second proposed UL scheme, we report a
   low-complexity ultradense WDM over DWDM allocation with 1-GHz wavelength
   spacing and novel phase-noise-insensitive heterodyne detection using
   MHz-linewidth lasers and an off-the-shelf envelope detector. We
   experimentally demonstrate the transmission and simple detection of
   multichannel 100/200 Mb/s OOK or 200 Mb/s 16-QAM-OFDM signals with 1-GHz
   spacing over 30-km standard single mode fiber using 5-MHz-linewidth
   lasers. By enabling ultrahigh spectral efficiency, high receiver
   sensitivity, and low-complexity, the proposed approach achieves a
   significant breakthrough for future high-capacity mobile fronthaul
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials have enabled the realization of unconventional
   electromagnetic properties not found in nature, which provokes us to
   rethink the established rules of optics in both the linear and nonlinear
   regimes. One of the most intriguing phenomena in nonlinear metamaterials
   is `backward phase-matching', which describes counter-propagating
   fundamental and harmonic waves in a negative-index medium. Predicted
   nearly a decade ago, this process is still awaiting a definitive
   experimental confirmation at optical frequencies. Here, we report
   optical measurements showing backward phase-matching by exploiting two
   distinct modes in a nonlinear plasmonic waveguide, where the real parts
   of the mode refractive indices are 3.4 and 3.4 for the fundamental and
   the harmonic waves respectively. The observed peak conversion effciency
   at the excitation wavelength of similar to 780 nm indicates the
   fulfilment of the phase-matching condition of k(2 omega) = 2k(omega) and
   n(2 omega) = -n(omega), where the coherent harmonic wave emerges along a
   direction opposite to that of the incoming fundamental light.}},

   was to accelerate the development and facilitate the comparison of
   robust methods for locating heart beats in long-term multi-channel

   beats was compiled from records that contained ECGs as well as pulsatile
   signals that directly reflect cardiac activity, and other signals that
   may have few or no observable markers of heart beats. A separate hidden

   PhysioNet, and a public framework has been developed to provide
   researchers with the ability to continue to automatically score and
   compare the performance of their algorithms. A scoring criteria based on
   the averaging of gross sensitivity, gross positive predictivity, average
   sensitivity, and average positive predictivity is proposed. The top

Abstract = {{The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well studied signal from which many
   clinically relevant parameters can be derived, such as heart rate. A key
   component in the estimation of these parameters is the accurate
   detection of the R peak in the QRS complex. While corruption of the ECG
   by movement artefact or sensor failure can result in poor delineation of
   the R peak, use of synchronously measured signals could allow for
   resolution of the R peak even scenarios with poor quality ECG
   recordings. Robust estimation of R peak locations from multimodal
   signals facilitates real time monitoring and is likely to reduce false
   alarms due to inaccurate derived parameters.
   We propose a method which fuses R peaks detected on the ECG using an
   energy detector with those detected on the arterial blood pressure (ABP)
   waveform using the length transform. A signal quality index (SQI) for
   the two signals is then derived. The ECG SQI is based upon the agreement
   between two distinct peak detectors. The ABP SQI estimates the blood
   pressure at various phases in the cardiac cycle and only accepts the
   signal as good quality if the values are physiologically plausible.
   Detections from these two signals were merged by selecting the R peak
   detections from the signal with a higher SQI. The approach presented in
   this paper was evaluated on datasets provided for the
   Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014. The algorithm achieved
   a sensitivity of 95.1\% and positive predictive value of 89.3\% on an
   external evaluation set, and achieved a score of 91.5\%.
   The method here demonstrated excellent performance across a variety of
   signal morphologies collected during clinical practice. Fusion of R
   peaks from other signals has the potential to provide informed estimates
   of the R peak location in situations where the ECG is noisy or
   completely absent. Source code for the algorithm is made available
   freely online.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate heart beat detection in signals acquired from intensive care
   unit (ICU) patients is necessary for establishing both normality and
   detecting abnormal events. Detection is normally performed by analysing
   the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, and alarms are triggered when
   parameters derived from this signal exceed preset or variable
   thresholds. However, due to noisy and missing data, these alarms are
   frequently deemed to be false positives, and therefore ignored by
   clinical staff. The fusion of features derived from other signals, such
   as the arterial blood pressure (ABP) or the photoplethysmogram (PPG),
   has the potential to reduce such false alarms. In order to leverage the
   highly correlated temporal nature of the physiological signals, a hidden
   semi-Markov model (HSMM) approach, which uses the intra-and inter-beat
   depolarization interval, was designed to detect heart beats in such
   data. Features based on the wavelet transform, signal gradient and
   signal quality indices were extracted from the ECG and ABP waveforms for
   use in the HSMM framework. The presented method achieved an overall
   score of 89.13\% on the hidden/test data set provided by the
   Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014: Robust Detection of
   Heart Beats in Multimodal Data.}},

Abstract = {{For the materials that simultaneously exhibit piezoelectric and
   semiconductor properties, such as wurtzite ZnO, GaN and InN, as well as
   two-dimensional single MoS2, piezoelectric charges induced by externally
   applied strain can tune/control carrier transport at a
   metal-semiconductor contact or semiconductor junction, which is named
   piezotronic effect. Metal-semiconductor-metal piezotronic transistors
   are key piezotronic nanodevices for electromechanical applications, and
   they are typical nonlinear elements. In this paper, a simplified
   current-voltage analysis solution of piezotronic transistors is
   developed, which can be used for circuit design and simulation.
   Furthermore, the typical nonlinear circuit: Chua's circuit based on
   piezotronic transistors is simulated. We find that the output signal of
   the piezotronic transistor circuit can be switched and changed
   asymmetrically by externally applied strain. This study provides insight
   into the nonlinear properties of the piezotronic transistor, as well as
   guidance for piezotronic transistor nonlinear circuit application.}},

Abstract = {{Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect
   and can lead to severe complications. Many studies have been conducted
   to evaluate the potential of geometric and hemodynamic biomarkers to
   predict BAV-related aortopathy. This work proposes a novel
   semi-automatic protocol to characterize geometry and hemodynamics of
   aorta and aortic valve based on 2D cine and 4D flow MRI data. The
   protocol was applied to 12 BAV and 12 control subjects. Statistical
   differences between the groups were identified and linear regression
   models were investigated to elucidate the potential of this protocol to
   investigate the risk of disease progression. Statistical differences
   between the groups were found for orifice eccentricity, aorta diameter,
   velocity, jet angle and flow displacement. Key findings of the
   regression analysis include the association in the proximal ascending
   aorta between aorta diameter and mean velocity (negative), jet angle
   (positive) and flow displacement (positive), in the combined cohort.
   Positive association between flow displacement in the proximal aorta and
   orifice jet angle in TAV subjects was found. This study represents a
   pilot application of a protocol for standardized assessment of aortic
   geometry and hemodynamics associated with BAV disease. Its limited need
   for user input is advantageous for large cohort studies.}},

Title = {{Implications of Genome-Based Discrimination between Clostridium

Abstract = {{Taxonomic classification of Clostridium botulinum is based on the
   production of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), while closely related,
   nontoxic organisms are classified as Clostridium sporogenes. However,
   this taxonomic organization does not accurately mirror phylogenetic
   relationships between these species. A phylogenetic reconstruction using
   2,016 orthologous genes shared among strains of C. botulinum group I and
   C. sporogenes clearly separated these two species into discrete clades
   which showed similar to 93\% average nucleotide identity (ANI) between
   them. Clustering of strains based on the presence of variable orthologs
   revealed 143 C. sporogenes clade-specific genetic signatures, a subset
   of which were further evaluated for their ability to correctly classify
   a panel of presumptive C. sporogenes strains by PCR. Genome sequencing
   of several C. sporogenes strains lacking these signatures confirmed that
   they clustered with C. botulinum strains in a core genome phylogenetic
   tree. Our analysis also identified C. botulinum strains that contained
   C. sporogenes clade-specific signatures and phylogenetically clustered
   with C. sporogenes strains. The genome sequences of two
   bont/B2-containing strains belonging to the C. sporogenes clade
   contained regions with similarity to a bont-bearing plasmid (pCLD),
   while two different strains belonging to the C. botulinum clade carried
   bont/B2 on the chromosome. These results indicate that bont/B2 was
   likely acquired by C. sporogenes strains through horizontal gene
   transfer. The genome-based classification of these species used to
   identify candidate genes for the development of rapid assays for
   molecular identification may be applicable to additional bacterial
   species that are challenging with respect to their classification.}},

   Safety-Climate Measurement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The prevalent disparity and divergence in the identification of
   safety-climate dimensions in the academia cause general confusion and
   inconvenience to both construction researchers and practitioners in
   terms of safety-climate measurement. Existing review studies identified
   several key dimensions or common features of safety climate, but only in
   a qualitative way. Whether these common features fit the reality and
   reflect the essence of construction safety climate is still to be
   verified by empirical studies. This research defined the core dimension
   and specific dimension of safety climate, identified the four most
   commonly used dimensions, and built a core dimension structure of safety
   climate accordingly. Empirical data collected from 21 Chinese
   construction enterprises were analyzed by means of structural equation
   modeling. The proposed core dimension structure and the corresponding
   measurement scale were validated rigorously by structural equation
   modeling approaches. Furthermore, two specific subgroups of the
   enterprises were analyzed to prove that the core dimension structure
   also applies to specific construction enterprise types, such as building
   contractors and specialty trade contractors. It is concluded that the
   proposed core dimension structure of safety climate is applicable in
   construction practices, especially to building enterprises. Practical
   implications of the safety-climate core dimension research are discussed
   in detail. This study contributes to the construction safety-climate
   study primarily by depicting relationships among the common dimensions
   as well as relationships between common dimensions and specific
   dimensions, which have rarely been involved or interpreted deeply in the
   past research. This can in turn facilitate the standardization of
   construction safety-climate measurement by providing a unified criterion
   (core dimension structure of safety climate) for both researchers and
   practitioners. It is a valid starting point to design specific
   measurement scales in different settings. (C) 2015 American Society of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments on single dense jets oriented at angles from 15
   degrees to 85 degrees to the horizontal are reported. The major flow
   properties were measured by laser-induced fluorescence at the maximum
   rise height, impact point, and, for the first time, at the end of the
   near field. The impact point dilution was insensitive to nozzle angle
   over the range of about 45-65 degrees. Because the additional mixing
   that occurred in the spreading layer beyond the impact point depended on
   nozzle angle, the near-field dilution was more sensitive to nozzle
   orientation and was highest for 60 degrees, consistent with generally
   accepted design practice. Bottom boundary effects on dilution were also
   addressed. Along the jet centerline, time-average dilution first
   increased and then actually decreased in a thin layer up to the wall.
   The concentration increase near the bed is due to an increase in
   turbulent intermittency and accumulation of more saline fluid elements
   at the bed. The presence of this layer may explain wide discrepancies in
   reported dilutions near the boundary and may be environmentally
   important due to exposure of benthic organisms and sea grasses to high
   salinity. It may not persist, however, as it can be swept up by vortices
   that propagate radially away from the impact point. The vortices entrain
   ambient fluid leading to increased dilution, but they eventually
   collapse under their self-induced density stratification, marking the
   end of the near field. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   CBM service providers by renting their manufacturing equipment instead
   of purchasing additional machines. To plan manufacturing scalability for
   CBM systems, it is crucial to identify potential manufacturing
   bottlenecks where the entire manufacturing system capacity is limited.
   Because of the complexity of manufacturing resource sharing behaviors,
   it is challenging to model and analyze the material flow of CBM systems
   in which sequential, concurrent, conflicting, cyclic, and mutually
   exclusive manufacturing processes typically occur. To address and
   further study this issue, we develop a stochastic Petri nets (SPNs)
   model to formally represent a CBM system, model and analyze the
   uncertainties in the complex material flow of the CBM system, evaluate
   manufacturing performance, and plan manufacturing scalability. We
   validate this approach by means of a delivery drone example that is used
   to demonstrate how manufacturers can indeed achieve rapid and
   cost-effective manufacturing scalability in practice by combining
   in-house manufacturing and crowdsourcing in a CBM setting.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a microwave expansion process to produce thermoset-matrix
   syntactic foam containing thermoplastic foam beads was designed and
   developed. Expandable polystyrene (EPS) microspheres and epoxy resin
   were chosen as a model material system. This process is featured with a
   capability to effectively expand EPS microspheres in syntactic foam with
   high EPS loading. The resin viscosity and specific microwave energy are
   found to be the two primary control parameters determining the process
   window. Mechanical characterization showed that the specific flexural
   strength and modulus of the syntactic foam are similar to those of the
   neat epoxy. By comparison, the flexural moduli over density squared or
   cubed of the foam are much higher, especially at high EPS loadings, than
   those of the neat resin. The foamed EPS microspheres can also
   effectively toughen the syntactic foam, preventing propagation of
   cracks. Furthermore, the microwave expansion process was found to be
   capable of molding syntactic foam parts of relatively sophisticated
   geometry with smooth surfaces.(C) 2014 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria has been investigated
   for several decades. While there are theories available to predict the
   adsorption behavior of ideal mixtures, there are few purely predictive
   theories to account for nonidealities in real systems. Most models
   available for dealing with nonidealities contain interaction parameters
   that must be obtained through correlation with binary-mixture data.
   However, as the number of components in a system grows, the number of
   parameters needed to be obtained increases exponentially. Here, a
   generalized procedure is proposed, as an extension of the predictive
   real adsorbed solution theory, for determining the parameters of any
   activity model, for any number of components, without correlation. This
   procedure is then combined with the adsorbed solution theory to predict
   the adsorption behavior of mixtures. As this method can be applied to
   any isotherm model and any activity model, it is referred to as the
   generalized predictive adsorbed solution theory. (c) 2015 American

Title = {{Size-Aware Cache Management for Compressed Cache Architectures}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{A practical way to increase the effective capacity of a microprocessor's
   cache, without physically increasing the cache size, is to employ data
   compression. Last-Level Caches (LLC) are particularly amenable to such
   compression schemes, since the primary purpose of the LLC is to minimize
   the miss rate, i.e., it directly benefits from a larger logical
   capacity. In compressed LLCs, the cacheline size varies depending on the
   achieved compression ratio. Our observations indicate that this size
   information gives useful hints when managing the cache (e.g., when
   selecting a victim), which can lead to increased cache performance.
   However, there are currently no replacement policies tailored to
   compressed LLCs; existing techniques focus primarily on locality
   information. This article introduces the concept of size-aware cache
   management as a way to maximize the performance of compressed caches.
   Upon analyzing the benefits of considering size information in the
   management of compressed caches, we propose a novel mechanism-called
   Effective Capacity Maximizer (ECM)-to further enhance the performance
   and energy consumption of compressed LLCs. The proposed technique
   revolves around four fundamental principles: ECM Insertion (ECM-I), ECM
   Promotion (ECM-P), ECM Eviction Scheduling (ECM-ES), and ECM Replacement
   (ECM-R). Extensive simulations with memory traces from real applications
   running on a full-system simulator demonstrate significant improvements
   compared to compressed cache schemes employing conventional
   locality-aware cache replacement policies. Specifically, our ECM shows
   an average effective capacity increase of 18.4 percent over the
   Least-Recently Used (LRU) policy, and 23.9 percent over the Dynamic
   Re-Reference Interval Prediction (DRRIP) {[}1] scheme. This translates
   into average system performance improvements of 7.2 percent over LRU and
   4.2 percent over DRRIP. Moreover, the average energy consumption is also
   reduced by 5.9 percent over LRU and 3.8 percent over DRRIP.}},

   fibers exhibited that tensile strengths obtained at 25.4 mm gauge length
   are comparable to those reported by the manufacturer using the standard
   strand testing results. On the other hand, experimental carbon fibers
   that have not been surface treated or sized, showed that single filament
   tensile strength values at 6 mm gauge length was comparable to the
   strand testing results. In addition, the compliance corrected tensile
   moduli of carbon fibers obtained by single filament tests were also
   comparable to the moduli obtained from the standard strand testing
   results. A modified Weibull analysis, which accounts for sample volume
   effects, has also been used to determine the Weibull modulus of both the

Abstract = {{We report the use of seed-mediated growth for the facile synthesis of
   five-fold twinned Pd nanorods with controlled diameters in the range of
   6-16 nm and tunable lengths up to 81 nm. In this approach, the formation
   of decahedral seeds and their anisotropic growth could be deliberately

   Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the nanorods were
   formed through the deposition of Pd atoms onto the surfaces of
   decahedral seeds along the < 110 > direction. Subsequent mechanistic
   studies indicated that a combination of a proper reduction rate and an
   effective capping agent was crucial to the formation of Pd nanorods.
   With the use of these Pd nanorods as templates, we also demonstrated the

Abstract = {{The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves has triggered an urgent need

   Here, we found that the reaction temperature plays an important role in
   the formation and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanosheets. Small
   anatase TiO2 nanoparticles are formed at low temperatures, large anatase
   TiO2 nanosheets appear along with some TiOF2 crystals as the temperature
   increases, and pure (001) faceted TiO2 nanosheets are formed at high
   temperatures. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2
   nanoparticles/nanosheets in hydrogen generation increases when the
   temperature increases. The (001) facet of TiO2 shows better
   photocatalytic activity over other facets, and the best performance in
   hydrogen generation is achieved with synergistic effects between TiO2

   and total chlorine, pH,turbidity, pressure, heterotrophic plate count)
   and microbial indicators (i.e., total coliforms, Escherichia coli,
   Enterococci, male-specific coliphages) were analyzed for spatial and
   temporal trends. Analysis of the samples from these rural water systems
   over nine months did not show a statistically significant association
   between distribution system sampling locations and water quality
   measures or microbial indicators. Temporal trends were consistent across
   sampling locations and were stronger than trends in spatial variability.
   However, substantial temporal heterogeneity of water quality measures
   was noted, potentially the result of seasonality, temperature
   fluctuations, and distribution system operation and maintenance
   practices. The study results indicate that system-level sampling efforts
   intended to inform microbial risk assessments must account for
   variability in indicators of risk over time.}},

Title = {{A new lattice Boltzmann model for interface reactions between immiscible
   fluids}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{139-149}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a lattice Boltzmann model to simulate
   chemical reactions taking place at the interface between two immiscible
   fluids. The phase-field approach is used to identify the interface and
   its orientation, the concentration of reactant at the interface is then
   calculated iteratively to impose the correct reactive flux condition.
   The main advantages of the model is that interfaces are considered part
   of the bulk dynamics with the corrective reactive flux introduced as a
   source/sink term in the collision step, and, as a consequence, the
   model's implementation and performance is independent of the interface
   geometry and orientation. Results obtained with the proposed model are
   compared to analytical solution for three different benchmark tests
   (stationary flat boundary, moving flat boundary and dissolving droplet).
   We find an excellent agreement between analytical and numerical
   solutions in all cases. Finally, we present a simulation coupling the
   Shan Chen multiphase model and the interface reactive model to simulate
   the dissolution of a collection of immiscible droplets with different
   sizes rising by buoyancy in a stagnant fluid. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{103-114}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Advances in tissue-engineering have resulted in a versatile tool-box to
   specifically design a tailored microenvironment for hematopoietic stem
   cells (HSCs) in order to study diseases that develop within this
   setting. However, most current in vivo models fail to recapitulate the
   biological processes seen in humans. Here we describe a highly
   reproducible method to engineer humanized bone constructs that are able
   to recapitulate the morphological features and biological functions of
   the HSC niches. Ectopic implantation of biodegradable composite
   scaffolds cultured for 4 weeks with human mesenchymal progenitor cells
   and loaded with rhBMP-7 resulted in the development of a chimeric bone
   organ including a large number of human mesenchymal cells which were
   shown to be metabolically active and capable of establishing a humanized
   microenvironment supportive of the homing and maintenance of human HSCs.
   A syngeneic mouse-to-mouse transplantation assay was used to prove the
   functionality of the tissue-engineered ossicles. We predict that the
   ability to tissue engineer a morphologically intact and functional
   large-volume bone organ with a humanized bone marrow compartment will
   help to further elucidate physiological or pathological interactions
   between human HSCs and their native niches. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The endothelial cells lining the inner wall of Schlemm's canal (SC) in
   the eye are relatively unique in that they support a basal-to-apical
   pressure gradient that causes these cells to deform, creating giant
   vacuoles and transendothelial pores through which the aqueous humor
   flows. Glaucoma is associated with an increased resistance to this flow.
   We used finite element modeling and estimates of cell modulus made using
   atomic force microscopy to characterize the pressure-induced deformation
   of SC cells and to estimate the maximum pressure drop that SC cells can
   support. We examined the effects of cell geometry, cell stiffness, and
   the contribution of the cell cortex to support the pressure-generated
   load. We found that the maximum strain generated by this loading occurs
   at the points of cell-substrate attachment and that the cortex of the
   cells bears nearly all of this load. The ability of these cells to
   support a significant transcellular pressure drop is extremely limited
   (on the order of 5 mmHg or less) unless these cells either stiffen very
   considerably with increasing deformation or have substantial attachments
   to their substratum away from their periphery. This puts limits on the
   flow resistance that this layer can generate, which has implications
   regarding the site where the bulk of the flow resistance is generated in
   healthy and glaucomatous eyes.}},

   corroborates the effectiveness of the Lang-Kobayashi model, though the
   model underestimates the entropy on the timescale of the relaxation
   oscillations and can lead to a time-delay signature that is less evident

Abstract = {{This paper develops an optimal frequency-weighted strategy to design

   The selection of the weighting function is driven by the expectation of
   the situations that would require anytime operation. For example, if the
   anytime operation is due to occasional and isolated missed deadlines,
   then the weighting on high frequencies should be larger than that for
   low frequencies. Low frequency components will have a smaller change
   over one sample time, so failing to update these components for one
   sample period will have less effect than with the high frequency
   components. Additional considerations explored in this paper are
   stability analyses, architectural issues, and transient management. Two

Abstract = {{Low porosity and permeability make it extremely difficult to develop
   shale oil and gas reservoirs. The stimulated reservoir volume is
   believed to have potential to obtain industry production by multi-stage
   or simultaneous fracturing in horizontal wells. The formation mechanism
   of network hydraulic fractures in fractured shale reservoirs remains
   poorly understood. In this article, a true tri-axial hydraulic
   fracturing system associated acoustic emission monitor was deployed to
   simulate hydraulic fracturing on shale outcrops. Results showed that the
   properties of natural fractures (such as aperture, orientation),
   compared to the viscosity and displacement of the fracturing fluid,
   affect the propagation direction of hydraulic fractures more
   predominantly. Each natural fracture in a natural fracture network can
   independently affect the hydraulic fracture. Low displacement (below the
   diffusion ability of a reservoir) fracturing tends to connect
   pre-existing fractures, while high displacement (surpass the diffusion
   ability of a reservoir) tends to create new fractures. After the
   breakdown pressure, an increase in injection rate results in more
   acoustic emission energy and induces new fractures. These results
   suggest that step-displacement fracturing technology is a possible
   mechanism to obtain effective fracture networks. Such an understanding
   would help to avoid unproductive, or sometimes destructive, costly
   segments of the hydraulic fracturing treatment design.}},

Title = {{A Study on Outcome Framing and Risk Attitude in Engineering Decisions
   Under Uncertainty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Decision making is a central activity in the design of an engineered
   system and has a significant impact on project outcomes. Although much
   research exists on engineering decision making, relatively little
   addresses behavioral aspects of how engineers make decisions. This is a
   potentially significant gap, as factors such as the way in which
   information is communicated and presented to engineers can matter
   greatly. For example, cognitive psychology has demonstrated that the
   choices people make can be strongly influenced by how the options are
   framed even when the different framings are mathematically equivalent.
   This paper explores the impact of framing on the types of decisions
   engineers face. Given engineers' intense mathematical training, it is
   possible that they are less susceptible to framing effects. Thus, there
   is motivation to determine whether relevant findings can be replicated
   in an engineering context. This paper presents a set of positively and
   negatively framed design scenarios. Consistent with prior experiments,
   engineers in the positive (gain) framed scenarios were more likely to
   choose the less risky option for three of the four scenarios. One of the
   scenarios did not show this bias but did include a longer time horizon
   which likely explains the difference. Engineers were risk neutral when
   the scenarios were presented negatively (loss) framed, which is in
   contrast to prior experiments on nonengineering populations. These
   results motivate the future research into the impact of framing on
   engineering decision making and effective guidelines on how to create
   engineering processes and tools that leverage or avoid inducing
   cognitive biases.}},

Title = {{Seismic characteristics of fluid escape pipes in sedimentary basins:
   Implications for pipe genesis}},
Journal = {{MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{126-140}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Fluid escape pipes were first documented from 3D seismic data over a
   decade ago, and have subsequently been identified in many petroliferous
   basins worldwide. They are characterized on seismic data by vertical to
   sub-vertical zones of reduced reflection continuity that have a columnar
   geometry in three-dimensions. The upper terminations of these pipes
   commonly coincide with pockmarks or palaeo-pockmarks, signifying a close
   connection of pipe formation with a high flux fluid expulsion process.
   Dimensions range from tens to hundreds of metres in diameter, and
   hundreds to over a thousand metres in height, and the slenderness ratio,
   defined as height/diameter (Omega), ranges from 0.8 to over 20. Pipes
   are frequently associated with sub-vertical clustering of amplitude
   anomalies on seismic data, related either to the presence of free gas,
   or to cementation linked to the passage of hydrocarbons.
   Three mechanisms have been suggested to explain pipe genesis: (1)
   hydraulic fracturing, (2) erosional fluidisation, and (3) capillary
   invasion. We suggest a further two possible mechanisms in the form of
   localised collapse by volume loss and synsedimentary flow localisation.
   We review all five mechanisms and conclude that it is unlikely that a
   single mechanism applies but that combinations of these processes may
   all occur in particular contexts. Fluid escape pipes may be far more
   widespread that currently appreciated, and they may play a critical role
   in secondary hydrocarbon migration and in providing leakage pathways for
   trapped hydrocarbons through overlying seals. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Title = {{Hyaluronic Acid-Based Nano gels Produced by Microfluidics-Facilitated
   Self-Assembly Improves the Safety Profile of the Cationic Host Defense
   Peptide Novicidin}},
Journal = {{PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Cationic host defence peptides constitute a promising class of
   therapeutic drug leads with a wide range of therapeutic applications,
   including anticancer therapy, immunomodulation, and antimicrobial
   activity. Although potent and efficacious, systemic toxicity and low
   chemical stability have hampered their commercial development. To
   overcome these challenges a novel nanogel-based drug delivery system was
   designed.
   Method The peptide novicidin was self-assembled with an octenyl succinic
   anhydride-modified analogue of hyaluronic acid, and this formulation was
   optimized using a microfluidics-based quality-by-design approach.
   Results By applying design-of-experiment it was demonstrated that the
   encapsulation efficiency of novicidin (15\% to 71\%) and the zeta
   potential (-24 to -57 mV) of the nanogels could be tailored by changing
   the preparation process parameters, with a maximum peptide loading of 36
   +/- 4\%. The nanogels exhibited good colloidal stability under different
   ionic strength conditions and allowed complete release of the peptide
   over 14 days. Furthermore, self-assembly of novicidin with hyaluronic
   acid into nanogels significantly improved the safety profile at least
   five-fold and six-fold when tested in HUVECs and NIH 3T3 cells,
   respectively, whilst showing no loss of antimicrobial activity against
   Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
   Conclusion Formulation in nanogels could be a viable approach to improve
   the safety profile of host defence peptides.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Localization kernels play an important role in the study of hierarchical
   material systems with well separated length scales. They allow for a
   computationally efficient communication of critical information between
   the constituent length scales. They are particularly well suited for
   capturing how an imposed variable (e.g., stress or strain) at the higher
   length scale is spatially distributed at the lower length scale (i.e.,
   localization linkages). In recent work, our research group has presented
   a novel framework called Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) for the
   representation and calibration of the localization kernels, and
   demonstrated the viability of this approach on selected individual
   material systems. In this work, we present and demonstrate an important
   extension to the MKS framework that allows representation and
   calibration of the localization kernels for an entire class of materials
   (e.g., a selected class of single phase cubic polycrystalline
   materials). (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   indicated that the materials from waste fabrics exhibited both similar

   temperature (around 185 degrees C). Infrared spectroscopy showed nearly
   the same main absorption peaks of neat nylon 6 and samples from nylon
   6/spandex fabrics. The viscosity of treated fabric samples was lower
   than that of untreated fabric composites at low and medium frequencies,
   as an effect of the spandex removal after treatment. The recycled

Abstract = {{Proper prediction of material microstructure from known processing
   conditions and constituent material properties is a critical step to
   determine the bulk properties of the composite. This paper reports a
   meso-structure model of multi-axial multi-layer warp-knitted (MMWK)
   composites from an elastic plastic material model considering the strain
   rate effect for the components of the MMWK composite. The representative
   unit cell (RUC) of fiber tow is created to obtain the elastic plastic
   parameters of the fiber tow. The 3D meso-structure model of the MMWK
   composite is based on an idealized geometrical model according to the
   preform structure of the MMWK fabric. The model is used to investigate
   the effect of the volume fraction of the knitting yarn on the dynamic
   in-plane compressive properties. The results show that the fiber tow
   failure at large extent is mainly caused by the micro cracking of the
   matrix, and the effects of the knitting yarn on the mechanical
   properties of MMWK composite are very limited. Particularly, MMWK
   composites could be considered as laminates when the volume fraction of
   the knitting yarn is low, such as below 1.5\%. Experiments were also
   conducted to validate the results from the simplified meso-structure
   model of the MMWK composite. The material is found to be strain rate
   sensitive, and the experimental and predicted results agree well with
   respect to the compressive strength and modulus of the composite. This
   confirms that the meso-structure MMWK composite model proposed is
   capable of capturing the essential features for the response of the
   composite under different strain rate conditions at the mesa-level. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper develops micromechanics models to estimate the tensile and
   compressive elastic moduli of elastic solids containing randomly
   distributed two-dimensional microcracks. The crack faces are open under
   tension and closed under compression. When the crack faces are closed,
   they may slide against one another following the Coulomb's law of dry
   friction. The micromechanics models provide analytical expressions of
   the tensile and compressive moduli for both static and dynamic cases. It
   is found that the tensile and compressive moduli are different. Further,
   under dynamic loading, the compressive and tensile moduli are both
   frequency dependent. As a by-product, the micromechanics models also
   predict wave attenuation in the dynamic case. Numerical simulations
   using the finite element method (FEM) are conducted to validate the
   micromechanics models.}},

Title = {{Identifying visual attributes for object recognition from text and
   taxonomy}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{12-23}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Attributes of objects such as ``square{''}, ``metallic{''}, and
   ``red{''} allow a way for humans to explain or discriminate object
   categories. These attributes also provide a useful intermediate
   representation for object recognition, including support for zero-shot
   learning from textual descriptions of object appearance. However, manual
   selection of relevant attributes among thousands of potential candidates
   is labor intensive. Hence, there is increasing interest in mining
   attributes for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce two novel
   techniques for nominating attributes and a method for assessing the
   suitability of candidate attributes for object recognition. The first
   technique for attribute nomination estimates attribute qualities based
   on their ability to discriminate objects at multiple levels of the
   taxonomy. The second technique leverages the linguistic concept of
   distributional similarity to further refine the estimated qualities.
   Attribute nomination is followed by our attribute assessment procedure,
   which assesses the quality of the candidate attributes based on their
   performance in object recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that both
   taxonomy and distributional similarity serve as useful sources of
   information for attribute nomination, and our methods can effectively
   exploit them. We use the mined attributes in supervised and zero-shot
   learning settings to show the utility of the selected attributes in
   object recognition. Our experimental results show that in the supervised
   case we can improve on a state of the art classifier while in the
   zero-shot scenario we make accurate predictions outperforming previous
   automated techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Microarchitectural and mechanical characterization of the sickle bone}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with sickle cell disease often experience acute and chronic
   bone pain due to occlusive events within the tissue vasculature that
   result in ischemia, necrosis, and organ degeneration. Macroscopically,
   sickle bone is identified in clinical radiographs by its reduced mineral
   density, widening of the marrow cavity, and thinning of the cortical
   bone due to the elevated erythroid hyperplasia accompanying the disease.
   However, the microstructural architecture of sickle bone and its role in
   mechanical functionality is largely unknown. This study utilized
   micro-CT and biomechanical testing to determine the relationship between
   the bone morphology, tissue mineral density, and trabecular and cortical
   microarchitecture of 10- and 21-week-old femurs from transgenic sickle
   male mice and littermates with sickle trait, as well as a wild-type
   control. While bone tissue mineral density did not vary among the
   genotypes at either age, variation in bone microstructure were observed.
   At 10 weeks, healthy and trait mice exhibited similar morphology within
   the cortical and trabecular bone, while sickle mice exhibited highly
   connected trabeculae. Within older femurs, sickle and trait specimens
   displayed significantly fewer trabeculae, and the remaining trabeculae
   had a more deteriorated geometry based on the structure model index.
   Thinning of the cortical region in sickle femurs contributed to the
   displayed flexibility with a significantly lower elastic modulus than
   the controls at both 10- and 21weeks old. Wild-type and trait femurs
   generally demonstrated similar mechanical properties; however, trait
   femurs had a significantly higher modulus than sickle and wild-type
   control at 21-weeks. Overall, these data indicate that the progressive
   damage to the microvasculature caused by sickle cell disease, results in
   deleterious structural changes in the bone tissue's microarchitecture
   and mechanics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Building information models (BIMs) are increasingly being applied
   throughout a building's lifecycle for various applications, such as
   progressive construction monitoring and defect detection, building
   renovation, energy simulation, and building system analysis in the
   Architectural, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management

   manually created from point clouds, which is labor-intensive, costly,
   and time consuming. This paper proposes a method for automatically
   extracting building geometries from unorganized point clouds. The
   collected raw data undergo data downsizing, boundary detection, and
   building component categorization, resulting in the building components
   being recognized as individual objects and their visualization as
   polygons. The results of tests conducted on three collected as-is
   building data to validate the technical feasibility and evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method indicate that it can simplify and
   accelerate the as-is building model from the point cloud creation

Abstract = {{Thermoacoustic oscillations associated with transverse acoustic modes
   are routinely encountered in combustion chambers. While a large
   literature on this topic exists for rockets, no systematic reviews of
   transverse oscillations are available for air-breathing systems, such as
   in boilers, aircraft engines, jet engine augmentors, or power generating
   gas turbines. This paper reviews work on the problem for air-breathing
   systems, summarizing experimental, modeling, and active control studies
   of transverse oscillations. It then details the key physical processes
   controlling these oscillations by describing transverse acoustic wave
   motions, the effect of transverse acoustic waves on hydrodynamic
   instabilities, and the influence of acoustic and hydrodynamic fluid
   motions on the unsteady heat release. This paper particularly emphasizes
   the distinctions between the direct and indirect effect of transverse
   wave motions, by arguing that the dominant effect of the transverse
   acoustics is to act as the ``clock{''} that controls the frequency and
   modal structure of the disturbance field. However, in many instances, it
   is the indirect axial flow disturbances at the nozzles (driven by
   pressure oscillations from the transverse mode), and the vortices that
   they excite, that cause the dominant heat release rate oscillations.
   Throughout the review, we discuss issues associated with simulating or
   scaling instabilities, either in subscale experimental geometries or by
   attempting to understand instability physics using identical nozzle
   hardware during axial oscillations of the same frequency as the
   transverse mode of interest. This review closes with a model problem
   that integrates many of these controlling elements, as well as
   recommendations for future research needs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Incremental light bundle adjustment for structure from motion and
   robotics}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{63-82}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Bundle adjustment (BA) is essential in many robotics and
   structure-from-motion applications. In robotics, often a bundle
   adjustment solution is desired to be available incrementally as new
   poses and 3D points are observed. Similarly in batch structure from
   motion, cameras are typically added incrementally to allow good
   initializations. Current incremental BA methods quickly become
   computationally expensive as more camera poses and 3D points are added
   into the optimization. In this paper we introduce incremental light
   bundle adjustment (iLBA), an efficient optimization framework that
   substantially reduces computational complexity compared to incremental
   bundle adjustment. First, the number of variables in the optimization is
   reduced by algebraic elimination of observed 3D points, leading to a
   structureless BA. The resulting cost function is formulated in terms of
   three-view constraints instead of re-projection errors and only the
   camera poses are optimized. Second, the optimization problem is
   represented using graphical models and incremental inference is applied,
   updating the solution using adaptive partial calculations each time a
   new camera is incorporated into the optimization. Typically, only a
   small fraction of the camera poses are recalculated in each optimization
   step. The 3D points, although not explicitly optimized, can be
   reconstructed based on the optimized camera poses at any time. We study
   probabilistic and computational aspects of iLBA and compare its accuracy
   against incremental BA and another recent structureless method using
   real imagery and synthetic datasets. Results indicate iLBA is 2-10 times
   faster than incremental BA, depending on number of image observations
   per frame. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   ultrafiltration membranes with high flux}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{487}},

Abstract = {{An intriguing polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with unique
   pillar-like structures was synthesized. The membrane was synthesized
   using the phase inversion method by adding the amphiphilic graft
   copolymer PVDF grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether
   methacrylate (PEGMA) (PVDF-g-PEGMA) to the PVDF backbone material. It
   had high flux and high sodium alginate rejection ratio under low
   transmembrane pressure. However, the mechanisms for the formation of
   pillar-like structures are still unknown. In this paper, we explored the
   formation mechanism of pillar-like structures from aspects of solvent
   and additive. Based on the experimental results and analysis of ternary
   diagram, both NMP and PVDF-g-PEGMA must coexist in casting solution to
   form pillar-like structures. When NMP is in the solvent, PEGMA segments
   have enough time to migrate to the surface and repel each other during
   the phase inversion process. Finally, by using the target plot method,
   one membrane with the best performance was chosen as the proposed
   membrane from all membranes that casted under different conditions. The
   proposed membrane has a pure water flux of 2173 L/m(2)/h/bar. The total
   organic carbon (TOC, by sodium alginate) removal efficiency is 89\%.
   This membrane may have a good potential in water treatment applications.

Abstract = {{This study considers separation performance of carbon molecular sieve
   (CMS) membranes formed by pyrolysis under argon at 550 degrees C for
   four novel polyimide precursors referred to as 6FDA/DETDA,
   6FDA:BPDA(1:1)/DETDA, 6FDA/DETDA:DABA(3:2) and 6FDA/1,5-ND:ODA(1:1). The
   CMS precursors were characterized using Thermogravimetric Analysis
   (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Wide-angle X-ray
   Diffraction (WAXD). Separation performance of polymer precursor films
   formed from these polymers was examined using pure gases CO2, CH4, O-2
   and N-2; a relationship between gas permeability and polymer fractional
   free volume (FFV) is reported. The pyrolyzed polymer precursor films to
   create dense CMS membranes produced separation performance that
   significantly exceeded the polymer precursor performance in all cases.
   The 6FDA/DETDA:DABA(3:2) derived CMS membranes showed the highest
   permeability (above 20,000 barrer for CO2 and above 4000 barrer for O-2
   at 35 degrees C) and offered the greatest practical potential among the
   various precursors. Separation performance of the CMS membranes was
   studied as a function of time, with storage under vacuum between tests
   to assess physical aging. As expected, permeability showed a decreasing
   trend with time, and CO2/CH4, O-2/N-2 selectivity showed an increasing
   trend. Sorption isotherms also provided insight into the microstructure
   evolution over time. For practical applications, continuous active feed
   of mixed gas 50\% CO2/50\% CH4 was shown to effectively suppress
   physical aging in 6FDA/DETDA:DABA(3:2) CMS membrane. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{The cement material adopted for a new geothermal well project in South
   Korea is specialized as the G-class cement, which is commonly used in
   the oil-well industry, and regulated by the API (American Petroleum
   Institute). In order to maintain the optimal generating performance of
   geothermal wells, physical properties of the cementing material should
   be satisfactory. In this paper, the significant material properties
   (i.e., groutability, uniaxial compressive strength, thermal
   conductivity, bleeding potential, phenolphthalein indication) of the
   G-class cement were experimentally examined, with consideration of
   various water cement (w/c) ratios as mix proportion. Important findings
   through the experiments are as follows; (1) Groutability of the G-class
   cement increases with the addition of a small amount of retarder. (2)
   There would be a structural problem when the w/c ratio is kept extremely
   high in order to obtain acceptable groutability. (3) Thermal
   conductivity of the G-class cement is small enough to prevent heat loss
   during circulating up hot steam or water from the deep underground to
   the ground surface. (4) The G-class cement used for geothermal-well
   cementing causes no bleeding problem. (5) The phenolphthalein indicator
   is applicable to distinguishing the G-class cement from the drilling
   mud. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the economic lot-sizing problem with perishable items
   (ELS-PI), where each item has a deterministic expiration date. Although
   all items in stock are equivalent regardless of procurement or
   expiration date, we allow for an allocation mechanism that defines an
   order in which the items are allocated to the consumers. In particular,
   we consider the following allocation mechanisms: First Expiration, First
   Out (FEFO), Last Expiration, First Out (LEFO), First In, First Out
   (FIFO) and Last In, First Out (LIFO). We show that the ELS-PI can be
   solved in polynomial time under all four allocation mechanisms in case
   of no procurement capacities. This result still holds in case of
   time-invariant procurement capacities under the FIFO and LEFO allocation
   mechanisms, but the problem becomes NP-hard under the FEFO and LIFO
   allocation mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   converter (MC), any abnormality/disturbance in the input voltages is
   directly reflected on the output voltages. In this paper, a new
   modulation strategy to control the 3x3 MC under unbalanced input voltage
   conditions is proposed. The proposed strategy is based on modification
   of the space vector modulation strategy, which formulates and solves an
   optimization problem to determine the best switching states and their
   corresponding optimal duty cycles, such that the errors in the output
   voltages and the input currents under unbalanced input voltage
   conditions are minimized. The salient feature of the proposed strategy
   is its capability to extend the output operating range of the MC. The
   proposed strategy ensures that optimal performance of the MC over the
   entire operating range, including the case when the converter operates
   with an output voltage greater than the maximum attainable balanced
   output voltage under unbalanced input voltage conditions, is achieved.
   Performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated and validated based on
   time-domain simulation studies in the MATLAB/Simulink software
   environment and experimentation on a scaled-down laboratory prototype.}},

Abstract = {{In a modern metropolis, metro rail systems have become a dominant mode
   for mass transportation. The structural health of a metro tunnel is
   closely related to public safety. Many vibration-based techniques for
   detecting and locating structural damage have been developed in the past
   several decades. However, most damage detection techniques and
   validation tests are focused on bridge and building structures; very few
   studies have been reported on tunnel structures. Among these techniques,
   transmissibility function and cross correlation analysis are two
   well-known diagnostic approaches. The former operates in frequency
   domain and the latter in time domain. Both approaches can be applied to
   detect and locate damage through acceleration data obtained from sensor
   arrays. Furthermore, the two approaches can directly utilize structural
   response data without requiring excitation measurement, which offers
   advantages in field testing on a large structure. In this research, a
   numerical finite element model of a metro tunnel is built and different
   types of structural defects are introduced at multiple locations of the
   tunnel. Transmissibility function and cross correlation analysis are
   applied to perform structural damage detection and localization, based
   on simulated structural vibration data. Numerical results demonstrate
   that the introduced defects can be successfully identified and located.
   The sensitivity and feasibility of the two approaches have been verified
   when sufficient distribution of measurement locations is available.
   Damage detection results of the two different approaches are compared
   and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional reliability evaluation method generally requires a large
   amount of previous data and information on historical lifetime. For an
   individual mechanical device without historical lifetime data, it is
   difficult to carry out the reliability assessment by using the
   traditional method. To attempt exploring this difficult problem, support
   evidence statistics (SES) as an approach to operation reliability
   assessment is presented in this paper. Moreover, this presented method
   is also expected to indicate the physical state changes of the
   individual mechanical device. Since in scientific research, evidence
   usually goes towards supporting or rejecting a hypothesis. For a running
   device, evidences derived from the running state information should
   consistently demonstrate its current sole-running-state within a given
   short time interval. In practice, due to the interference of
   environmental noises, these evidences lose the consistency. Accordingly,
   they can be classified into two classes: the firm evidences and the
   flimsy evidences. Analogous to the support vector data description
   (SVDD), these firm evidences which show remarkable consistency can form
   a support evidence space (SESP) through one-class classification.
   Suppose that a SESP is obtained by using the evidences accumulated from
   the normal running state, the device operation reliability at any time
   of unknown running state can be evaluated through the statistical
   comparison between the normal SESP and the unknown SESP. This
   reliability evaluation process is named as SES. The most fundamental
   distinction between the proposed method and the traditional method lies
   in different statistical objects. The traditional methods are to analyze
   lifetime data while the proposed methods are to analyze running state
   data. Obviously, the evidence feature optimization plays a crucial role
   in the presented method. The maximum correlation and minimum redundancy
   (MCMR) method is improved by principal component analysis (PCA) to
   select evidence features based on vibration signals. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the presented method is validated through a new
   experiment of rolling bearing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new audio watermarking scheme based on self-adaptive
   particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) and quatemion wavelet transform
   (QWT) is proposed. By obtaining optimal watermark strength using a
   uniquely designed objective function, SAPSO addresses the conflicting
   problem of robustness, imperceptibility, and capacity of audio
   watermarking scheme using self-adjusted parameters. To withstand
   de-synchronization attack, a synchronization sequence generated by
   chaotic signals is also adopted in our scheme. Furthermore, the
   utilization of chaotic signals significantly enhances the security of
   the proposed scheme. The experimental results validate that our scheme
   is not only robust against de-synchronization attack, but also typical
   signal manipulations and StirMark attack. Our comparative analysis also
   revealed that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-arts
   audio watermarking schemes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We present new algorithms for detecting the emergence of a community in
   large networks from sequential observations. The networks are modeled
   using Erdos-Renyi random graphs with edges forming between nodes in the
   community with higher probability. Based on statistical changepoint
   detection methodology, we develop three algorithms: the Exhaustive
   Search (ES), the Mixture, and the Hierarchical Mixture (H-Mix) methods.
   Performance of these methods is evaluated by the average run length
   (ARL), which captures the frequency of false alarms, and the detection
   delay. Numerical comparisons show that the ES method performs the best;
   however, it is exponentially complex. The Mixture method is polynomially
   complex by exploiting the fact that the size of the community is
   typically small in a large network. However, it may react to a group of
   active edges that do not form a community. This issue is resolved by the
   H-Mix method, which is based on a dendrogram decomposition of the
   network. We present an asymptotic analytical expression for ARL of the
   Mixture method when the threshold is large.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: PhosPhatidic Acid Phosphatase type 2B (PPAP2B), an integral
   membrane protein known as lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP3) that
   inactivates lysophosphatidic acid, was implicated in coronary artery
   disease (CAD) by genome-wide association studies. However, it is unclear
   whether genome-wide association studies-identified coronary artery
   disease genes, including PPAP2B, participate in mechanotransduction
   mechanisms by which vascular endothelia respond to local atherorelevant
   hemodynamics that contribute to the regional nature of atherosclerosis.
   Objective: To establish the critical role of PPAP2B in endothelial
   responses to hemodynamics.
   Methods and Results: Reduced PPAP2B was detected in vivo in mouse and
   swine aortic arch (AA) endothelia exposed to chronic disturbed flow, and
   in mouse carotid artery endothelia subjected to surgically induced acute
   disturbed flow. In humans, PPAP2B was reduced in the downstream part of
   carotid plaques where low shear stress prevails. In culture, reduced
   PPAP2B was measured in human aortic endothelial cells under
   atherosusceptible waveform mimicking flow in human carotid sinus.
   Flow-sensitive microRNA-92a and transcription factor KLF2 were
   identified as upstream inhibitor and activator of endothelial PPAP2B,
   respectively. PPAP2B suppression abrogated atheroprotection of
   unidirectional flow; inhibition of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1
   restored the flow-dependent, anti-inflammatory phenotype in
   PPAP2B-deficient cells. PPAP2B inhibition resulted in myosin light-chain
   phosphorylation and intercellular gaps, which were abolished by
   lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1/2 inhibition. Expression quantitative
   trait locus mapping demonstrated PPAP2B coronary artery disease risk
   allele is not linked to PPAP2B expression in various human tissues but
   significantly associated with reduced PPAP2B in human aortic endothelial
   cells.
   Conclusions: Atherorelevant flows dynamically modulate endothelial
   PPAP2B expression through miR-92a and KLF2. Mechanosensitive PPAP2B
   plays a critical role in promoting anti-inflammatory phenotype and
   maintaining vascular integrity of endothelial monolayer under
   atheroprotective flow.}},

Title = {{Effect of Osmotic Pressure on the Stability of Whole Inactivated
   Influenza Vaccine for Coating on Microneedles}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Enveloped virus vaccines can be damaged by high osmotic strength
   solutions, such as those used to protect the vaccine antigen during
   drying, which contain high concentrations of sugars. We therefore
   studied shrinkage and activity loss of whole inactivated influenza virus
   in hyperosmotic solutions and used those findings to improve vaccine
   coating of microneedle patches for influenza vaccination. Using
   stopped-flow light scattering analysis, we found that the virus
   underwent an initial shrinkage on the order of 10\% by volume within 5 s
   upon exposure to a hyperosmotic stress difference of 217
   milliosmolarity. During this shrinkage, the virus envelope had very low
   osmotic water permeability (1-6x10(-4) cm s(-1)) and high Arrhenius
   activation energy (E-a = 15.0 kcal mol(-1)), indicating that the water
   molecules diffused through the viral lipid membranes. After a
   quasi-stable state of approximately 20 s to 2 min, depending on the
   species and hypertonic osmotic strength difference of disaccharides,
   there was a second phase of viral shrinkage. At the highest osmotic
   strengths, this led to an undulating light scattering profile that
   appeared to be related to perturbation of the viral envelope resulting
   in loss of virus activity, as determined by in vitro hemagglutination
   measurements and in vivo immunogenicity studies in mice. Addition of
   carboxymethyl cellulose effectively prevented vaccine activity loss in
   vitro and in vivo, believed to be due to increasing the viscosity of
   concentrated sugar solution and thereby reducing osmotic stress during
   coating of microneedles. These results suggest that hyperosmotic
   solutions can cause biphasic shrinkage of whole inactivated influenza
   virus which can damage vaccine activity at high osmotic strength and
   that addition of a viscosity enhancer to the vaccine coating solution
   can prevent osmotically driven damage and thereby enable preparation of
   stable microneedle coating formulations for vaccination.}},

Title = {{Efficient fdCas9 Synthetic Endonuclease with Improved Specificity for
   Precise Genome Engineering}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{The Cas9 endonuclease is used for genome editing applications in diverse
   eukaryotic species. A high frequency of off-target activity has been
   reported in many cell types, limiting its applications to genome
   engineering, especially in genomic medicine. Here, we generated a
   synthetic chimeric protein between the catalytic domain of the FokI
   endonuclease and the catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (fdCas9). A
   pair of guide RNAs (gRNAs) that bind to sense and antisense strands with
   a defined spacer sequence range can be used to form a catalytically
   active dimeric fdCas9 protein and generate double-strand breaks (DSBs)
   within the spacer sequence. Our data demonstrate an improved catalytic
   activity of the fdCas9 endonuclease, with a spacer range of 15-39
   nucleotides, on surrogate reporters and genomic targets. Furthermore, we
   observed no detectable fdCas9 activity at known Cas9 off-target sites.
   Taken together, our data suggest that the fdCas9 endonuclease variant is
   a superior platform for genome editing applications in eukaryotic
   systems including mammalian cells.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of a small-wavelength multimodal perturbation with a
   large-wavelength inclined interface perturbation is investigated for the
   reshocked Richtmyer-Meshkov instability using three-dimensional
   simulations. The ARES code, developed at Lawrence Livermore National
   Laboratory, was used for these simulations and a detailed comparison of
   simulation results and experiments performed at the Georgia Tech Shock
   Tube facility is presented first for code validation. Simulation results
   are presented for four cases that vary in large-wavelength perturbation
   amplitude and the presence of secondary small-wavelength multimode
   perturbations. Previously developed measures of mixing and turbulence
   quantities are presented that highlight the large variation in
   perturbation length scales created by the inclined interface and the
   multimode complex perturbation. Measures are developed for entrainment,
   and turbulence anisotropy that help to identify the effects of and
   competition between each perturbations type. It is shown through
   multiple measures that before reshock the flow processes a distinct
   memory of the initial conditions that is present in both
   large-scale-driven entrainment measures and small-scale-driven mixing
   measures. After reshock the flow develops to a turbulentlike state that
   retains a memory of high-amplitude but not low-amplitude
   large-wavelength perturbations. It is also shown that the high-amplitude
   large-wavelength perturbation is capable of producing small-scale mixing
   and turbulent features similar to the small-wavelength multimode
   perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Using chemical ionization mass spectrometry to detect particle-phase
   acids and aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) measurements from Colorado,
   USA, and two studies in Hyytiala, Finland, we quantify the fraction of
   organic aerosol (OA) mass that is composed of molecules with acid
   functional groups (f(acid)). Molecules containing one or more carboxylic
   acid functionality contributed approximately 29\% (45-51\%) of the OA
   mass in Colorado (Finland). Organic acid mass concentration correlates
   well with AMS m/z 44 (primarily CO2+), a commonly used marker for highly
   oxidized aerosol. Using the average empirical relationship between AMS
   m/z 44 and organic acids in these three studies, together with m/z 44
   data from 29 continental northern hemispheric (NH) AMS data sets, we
   estimate that molecules containing carboxylic acid functionality
   constitute on average 28\% (range 10-50\%) of NH continental OA mass
   with typically higher values at rural/remote sites and during summer and
   lower values at urban sites and during winter.}},

Abstract = {{The wettability of graphitic carbon and silicon surfaces was numerically
   and theoretically investigated. A multi-response method has been
   developed for the analysis of conventional molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations of droplets wettability. The contact angle and indicators of
   the quality of the computations are tracked as a function of the data
   sets analyzed over time. This method of analysis allows accurate
   calculations of the contact angle obtained from the MD simulations.
   Analytical models were also developed for the calculation of the work of
   adhesion using the mean-field theory, accounting for the interfacial
   entropy changes. A calibration method is proposed to provide better
   predictions of the respective contact angles under different
   solid-liquid interaction potentials. Estimations of the binding energy
   between a water monomer and graphite match those previously reported. In
   addition, a breakdown in the relationship between the binding energy and
   the contact angle was observed. The macroscopic contact angles obtained
   from the MD simulations were found to match those predicted by the
   mean-field model for graphite under different wettability conditions, as
   well as the contact angles of Si(100) and Si(111) surfaces. Finally, an
   assessment of the effect of the Lennard-Jones cutoff radius was
   conducted to provide guidelines for future comparisons between numerical
   simulations and analytical models of wettability. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Conjugation of small organic molecules and polymers to polyhedral
   oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) cores results in navel hybrid materials with
   unique physical, characteristics. We report-here an approach in which
   star-shaped organic-inorganic scaffolds bearing eight cyclooctyne
   moieties can be rapidly functionalized via strain-promoted azide-alkyne
   cycloaddition (SPAAC) to synthesize a series of nearly monodisperse
   branched core-Shell nanoparticles with hydrophobic POSS cores and
   hydrophilic arms. We established that SPAAC is a robust method for POSS
   core octafunctionalization with the reaction rate constant of 1.9 X
   10(-2) M-1 s(-1). Functionalization with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   azide, fluorescein azide; and unprotected lactose azide gave conjugates
   which represent different classes of compounds: polymer conjugates,
   fluorescent dots, and bioconjugates. These resulting hybrid compounds
   were preliminarily tested for their ability to self-assemble in solution
   and at the air-water interface. We observed the formation of robust
   smooth Langmuir monolayers with diverse morphologies. We found that
   polar lactose moieties are Completely submerged into the subphase
   whereas the relatively hydrophobic fluorescein arms had extended
   conformation at the interface, and PEG arms were partially submerged.
   Finally, we observed the formation of stable micelles with sizes between
   70 and 160 nm in aqueous solutions with size and morphology of the
   structures dependent on the molecular weight and the type of the
   peripheral hydrophilic moieties.}},

Abstract = {{This work aimed to develop a whole-cell biotransformation process for
   the production of alpha-ketoisocaproate from L-leucine. A recombinant
   Escherichia coli strain was constructed by expressing an L-amino acid
   deaminase from Proteus vulgaris. To enhance alpha-ketoisocaproate
   production, the reaction conditions were optimized as follows:
   whole-cell biocatalyst 0.8 g/L, leucine concentration 13.1 g/L,
   temperature 35 degrees C, pH 7.5, and reaction time 20 h. Under the
   above conditions, the alpha-ketoisocaproate titer reached 12.7 g/L with
   a leucine conversion rate of 97.8\%. In addition, different leucine
   feeding strategies were examined to increase the alpha-ketoisocaproate
   titer. When 13.1 g/L leucine was added at 2-h intervals (from 0 to 22 h,
   12 addition times), the alpha-ketoisocaproate titer reached 69.1 g/L,
   while the leucine conversion rate decreased to 50.3\%. We have developed
   an effective process for the biotechnological production of
   alpha-ketoisocaproate that is more environmentally friendly than the
   traditional petrochemical synthesis approach.}},

Abstract = {{A broadly cross-protective influenza vaccine that can be administrated
   by a painless self-immunization method would be a value as a potential
   universal mass vaccination strategy. This study developed a
   minimally-invasive microneedle (MN) patch for skin vaccination with
   virus-like particles containing influenza virus heterologous M2
   extracellular (M2e) domains (M2e5xVLPs) as a universal vaccine candidate
   without adjuvants. The stability of M2e5x VLP-coated microneedles was
   maintained for 8 weeks at room temperature without losing M2e
   antigenicity and immunogenicity. MN skin immunization induced strong
   humoral and mucosal M2e antibody responses and conferred
   cross-protection against heterosubtypic H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza
   virus challenges. In addition, M2e5x VLPMN skin vaccination induced
   T-helper type 1 responses such as IgG2a isotype antibodies and IFN-gamma
   producing cells at higher levels than those by conventional
   intramuscular injection. These potential immunological and logistic
   advantages for skin delivery of M2e5x VLP MN vaccines could offer a
   promising approach to develop an easy-to-administer universal influenza
   vaccine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol activation into cloud droplets is an important process that
   governs aerosol indirect effects. The advanced treatment of aerosol
   activation by Fountoukis and Nenes (2005) and its recent updates,
   collectively called the FN series, have been incorporated into a newly
   developed regional coupled climate-air quality model based on the
   Weather Research and Forecasting model with the physics package of the
   Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (WRF-CAM5) to simulate
   aerosol-cloud interactions in both resolved and convective clouds. The
   model is applied to East Asia for two full years of 2005 and 2010. A
   comprehensive model evaluation is performed for model predictions of
   meteorological, radiative, and cloud variables, chemical concentrations,
   and column mass abundances against satellite data and surface
   observations from air quality monitoring sites across East Asia. The
   model performs overall well for major meteorological variables including
   near-surface temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, precipitation,
   cloud fraction, precipitable water, downward shortwave and longwave
   radiation, and column mass abundances of CO, SO2, NO2, HCHO, and O-3 in
   terms of both magnitudes and spatial distributions. Larger biases exist
   in the predictions of surface concentrations of CO and NOx at all sites
   and SO2, O-3, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations at some sites, aerosol
   optical depth, cloud condensation nuclei over ocean, cloud droplet
   number concentration (CDNC), cloud liquid and ice water path, and cloud
   optical thickness. Compared with the default Abdul-Razzack Ghan (2000)
   parameterization, simulations with the FN series produce similar to
   107-113\% higher CDNC, with half of the difference attributable to the
   higher aerosol activation fraction by the FN series and the remaining
   half due to feedbacks in subsequent cloud microphysical processes. With
   the higher CDNC, the FN series are more skillful in simulating cloud
   water path, cloud optical thickness, downward shortwave radiation,
   shortwave cloud forcing, and precipitation. The model evaluation
   identifies several areas of improvements including emissions and their
   vertical allocation as well as model formulations such as aerosol
   formation, cloud droplet nucleation, and ice nucleation.}},

   by depositing a few atomic layers of platinum (Pt) as conformal shells
   on palladium (Pd) nanocrystals with well-defined facets and then etching
   away the Pd templates. Density functional theory calculations suggest
   that the etching is initiated via a mechanism that involves the
   formation of vacancies through the removal of Pd atoms incorporated into
   the outermost layer during the deposition of Pt. With the use of Pd
   nanoscale cubes and octahedra as templates, we obtained Pt cubic and
   octahedral nanocages enclosed by \{100\} and \{111\} facets,

Abstract = {{Although the biology of platelet adhesionon subendothelial matrix after
   vascular injury is well characterized, how the matrix biophysical
   properties affect platelet physiology is unknown. Here we demonstrate
   that geometric orientation of the matrix itself regulates platelet
   alpha-granule secretion, a key component of platelet activation. Using
   protein micro-contact printing, we show that platelets spread beyond the
   geometric constraints of fibrinogen or collagen micropatterns with <5-mu
   m features. Interestingly, alpha-granule exocytosis and deposition of
   the alpha-granule contents such as fibrinogen and fibronectin were
   primarily observed in those areas of platelet extension beyond the
   matrix protein micropatterns. This enables platelets to
   ``self-deposit{''} additional matrix, provide more cellular membrane to
   extend spreading, and reinforce platelet-platelet connections.
   Mechanistically, this phenomenon is mediated by actin polymerization,
   Rac1 activation, and (alpha parallel to b)beta(3) integrin
   redistribution and activation, and is attenuated in gray platelet
   syndrome platelets, which lack alpha-granules, and Wiskott-Aldrich
   syndrome platelets, which have cytoskeletal defects. Overall, these
   studies demonstrate how platelets transduce geometric cues of the
   underlying matrix geometry into intracellular signals to extend
   spreading, which endows platelets spatial flexibility when spreading
   onto small sites of exposed subendothelium.}},

Abstract = {{We use two methods, the changing snapshot method and transition state

   framework flexibility on diffusion of spherical molecules in 8MR

   Rn) and CF4. We demonstrate the effect of the zeolite framework
   flexibility on diffusion by considering the size and loading of
   adsorbates and temperature. In both the methods, we approximate flexible
   structures as a set of discrete rigid snapshots obtained from molecular
   dynamics simulations of an empty framework. We show that the
   diffusivities predicted with these two efficient methods agree with
   direct MD simulations in the fully flexible structures. We studied in
   detail how the framework flexibility affects the loading dependence of
   diffusion. By looking at the computational costs, we demonstrated that
   both the methods are orders of magnitude more efficient than the fully
   flexible simulations. We then apply the changing snapshot method to
   binary mixtures of adsorbates to obtain accurate binary diffusivities
   and binary selectivities.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal metal nanoparticles have unique surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) properties for applications in optics, medicine, photocatalysis,
   and photovoltaics. In this work, we use the Mie theory to investigate
   the SPR properties of bimetallic cote-shell nanoparticles having a
   spherical shape and consisting of Drude metals. We find that there
   exists a special SPR. mode whose energy is concentrated at the interface
   between the core and the shell, and we call it the extraordinary SPR
   mode: This mode can interact with the conventional,SPR mode whose energy
   is concentrated at the outer surface of the bimetallic natioparticle,
   which is called the ordinary SPR mode. The ordinary and extraordinary
   SPR modes together determine the line shape of the extinction Spectrum
   as well as the shift of SPR peak (to shorter or longer wavelengths) as a
   function of various' geometric parameters. When extended to practical
   noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pd and Pt, we find that the SPR of both
   Au@Pt and Au@Pd nanoparticles can occur in the visible region with high
   tunability, which is beneficial to the enhancement of photocatalytic
   properties of both Pd and Pt. The theoretical studies would open up new
   avenues for engineering the plasmonic properties Of bimetallic

Abstract = {{We present an extension of previous methods that derive transferable
   force fields to describe the adsorption of small molecules in zeolites
   based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the
   adsorption of C8 cyclic hydrocarbons in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
   We use our DFT-based force field to predict the adsorption properties of
   these molecules in MOFs where dispersion governs adsorption properties
   using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. We observe that
   DFT-derived force fields provide moderately more accurate predictions
   compared to generic force fields for single-component adsorption in
   these systems. We find that generic force fields can give qualitative
   agreement with experiments for binary selectivities, which could
   eventually be useful for materials screening purposes. We also assess
   the influence of factors such as framework relaxation due to guest
   adsorption on these calculations and find that these effects can produce
   significant changes in the simulated binary selectivities at high
   loadings. Our methodology will eventually be useful for developing force
   fields for systems in which generic force fields are known to fail and
   represent a useful step in understanding and predicting adsorption
   properties of C-8 hydrocarbons in MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating biophysical cellular interactions in the circulation
   currently requires choosing between in vivo models, which are difficult
   to interpret due in part to the hemodynamic and geometric complexities
   of the vasculature; or in vitro systems, which suffer from
   non-physiologic assumptions and/or require specialized microfabrication
   facilities and expertise. To bridge that gap, we developed an in vitro
   ``do-it-yourself{''} perfusable vasculature model that recapitulates in
   vivo geometries, such as aneurysms, stenoses, and bifurcations, and
   supports endothelial cell culture. These inexpensive, disposable devices
   can be created rapidly (<2 hours) with high precision and repeatability,
   using standard off-the-shelf laboratory supplies. Using these
   ``endothelialized{''} systems, we demonstrate that spatial variation in
   vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) expression correlates with the
   wall shear stress patterns of vascular geometries. We further observe
   that the presence of endothelial cells in stenoses reduces platelet
   adhesion but increases sickle cell disease (SCD) red blood cell (RBC)
   adhesion in bifurcations. Overall, our method enables researchers from
   all disciplines to study cellular interactions in physiologically
   relevant, yet simple-to-make, in vitro vasculature models.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have attracted increasing
   attention due to their potential for improved thermomechanical
   compatibility of the electrolyte and the electrodes, reduced fabrication
   cost, and enhanced immunity to coking and sulfur poisoning. While the
   electrode materials of symmetrical SOFCs are initially limited to those
   with stable phase structures under both reducing and oxidizing
   atmospheres, many novel electrode materials are currently being
   developed and investigated that may undergo a beneficial phase
   transition or reduction in a reducing atmosphere, although the same
   material may be used initially for the construction of both anode and
   cathode. Here, the advances made in the development of electrode
   materials and structures for symmetrical SOFCs are summarized, including
   single-phase electrodes, multi-phase (composite) electrodes, and those
   that are reducible upon exposure to a reducing atmosphere. The
   electrical conductivity, thermomechanical properties, and redox behavior
   of these electrode materials, together with their performance and
   stability in different SOFCs, are discussed and analyzed. The problems
   associated with different types of symmetrical SOFCs are outlined and
   the materials that show promise as symmetrical electrodes are
   highlighted, offering critical insights and useful guidelines for
   knowledge-based rational design of better electrodes for commercially
   viable symmetrical SOFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral diversity of fluorescent proteins, crucial for multiparameter
   imaging, is based mainly on chemical diversity of their chromophores.
   Recently we have reported, to our knowledge, a new green fluorescent
   protein WasCFP-the first fluorescent protein with a tryptophan-based
   chromophore in the anionic state. However, only a small portion of
   WasCFP molecules exists in the anionic state at physiological
   conditions. In this study we report on an improved variant of WasCFP,
   named NowGFP, with the anionic form dominating at 37 degrees C and
   neutral pH. It is 30\% brighter than enhanced green fluorescent protein
   (EGFP) and exhibits a fluorescence lifetime of 5.1 ns. We demonstrated
   that signals of NowGFP and EGFP can be clearly distinguished by
   fluorescence lifetime in various models, including mammalian cells,
   mouse tumor xenograft, and Drosophila larvae. NowGFP thus provides an
   additional channel for multiparameter fluorescence lifetime imaging
   microscopy of green fluorescent proteins.}},

Title = {{A three-dimensional image processing program for accurate, rapid, and
   semi-automated segmentation of neuronal somata with dense neurite
   outgrowth}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis techniques provide a powerful
   means to rapidly and accurately assess complex morphological and
   functional interactions between neural cells. Current software-based
   identification methods of neural cells generally fall into two
   applications: (1) segmentation of cell nuclei in high-density constructs
   or (2) tracing of cell neurites in single cell investigations. We have
   developed novel methodologies to permit the systematic identification of
   populations of neuronal somata possessing rich morphological detail and
   dense neurite arborization throughout thick tissue or 3-D in vitro
   constructs. The image analysis incorporates several novel automated
   features for the discrimination of neurites and somata by initially
   classifying features in 2-D and merging these classifications into 3-D
   objects; the 3-D reconstructions automatically identify and adjust for
   over and under segmentation errors. Additionally, the platform provides
   for software-assisted error corrections to further minimize error. These
   features attain very accurate cell boundary identifications to handle a
   wide range of morphological complexities. We validated these tools using
   confocal z-stacks from thick 3-D neural constructs where neuronal somata
   had varying degrees of neurite arborization and complexity, achieving an
   accuracy of >95\%. We demonstrated the robustness of these algorithms in
   a more complex arena through the automated segmentation of neural cells
   in ex vivo brain slices. These novel methods surpass previous techniques
   by improving the robustness and accuracy by: (1) the ability to process
   neurites and somata, (2) bidirectional segmentation correction, and (3)
   validation via software-assisted user input. This 3-D image analysis
   platform provides valuable tools for the unbiased analysis of neural
   tissue or tissue surrogates within a 3D context, appropriate for the
   study of multi-dimensional cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Dimers of 2-substituted N,N-dimethylbenzimidazoline radicals,
   (2-Y-DMBI)(2) (Y=cyclohexyl (Cyc), ferrocenyl (Fc), ruthenocenyl (Rc)),
   have recently been reported as n-dopants for organic semiconductors.
   Here their structural and energetic characteristics are reported, along
   with the mechanisms by which they react with acceptors, A (PCBM,
   TIPS-pentacene), in solution. X-ray data and DFT calculations both
   indicate a longer CC bond for (2-Cyc-DMBI)(2) than (2-Fc-DMBI)(2), yet
   DFT and ESR data show that the latter dissociates more readily due to
   stabilization of the radical by Fc. Depending on the energetics of dimer
   (D-2) dissociation and of D-2-to-A electron transfer, D-2 reacts with A
   to form D+ and A(-) by either of two mechanisms, differing in whether
   the first step is endergonic dissociation or endergonic electron
   transfer. However, the D+/0.5D(2) redox potentialsthe effective reducing
   strengths of the dimersvary little within the series (ca. -1.9V vs.
   FeCp2+/0) (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) due to cancelation of trends in the D+/0
   potential and D-2 dissociation energy. The implications of these
   findings for use of these dimers as n-dopants, and for future dopant
   design, are discussed.}},

Title = {{An optimization framework for measuring spatial access over healthcare
   networks}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUL 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Measurement of healthcare spatial access over a network
   involves accounting for demand, supply, and network structure. Popular
   approaches are based on floating catchment areas; however the methods
   can overestimate demand over the network and fail to capture cascading
   effects across the system.
   Methods: Optimization is presented as a framework to measure spatial
   access. Questions related to when and why optimization should be used
   are addressed. The accuracy of the optimization models compared to the
   two-step floating catchment area method and its variations is
   analytically demonstrated, and a case study of specialty care for Cystic
   Fibrosis over the continental United States is used to compare these
   approaches.
   Results: The optimization models capture a patient's experience rather
   than their opportunities and avoid overestimating patient demand. They
   can also capture system effects due to change based on congestion.
   Furthermore, the optimization models provide more elements of access
   than traditional catchment methods.
   Conclusions: Optimization models can incorporate user choice and other
   variations, and they can be useful towards targeting interventions to
   improve access. They can be easily adapted to measure access for
   different types of patients, over different provider types, or with
   capacity constraints in the network. Moreover, optimization models allow
   differences in access in rural and urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{In Bi-directional Glenn (BDG) physiology, the superior systemic
   circulation and pulmonary circulation are in series. Consequently, only
   blood from the superior vena cava is oxygenated in the lungs. Oxygenated
   blood then travels to the ventricle where it is mixed with blood
   returning from the lower body. Therefore, incremental changes in oxygen
   extraction ratio (OER) could compromise exercise tolerance. In this
   study, the effect of exercise on the hemodynamic and ventricular
   performance of BDG physiology was investigated using clinical patient
   data as inputs for a lumped parameter model coupled with oxygenation
   equations. Changes in cardiac index, Q(P)/Q(S), systemic pressure,
   oxygen extraction ratio and ventricular/vascular coupling ratio were
   calculated for three different exercise levels. The patient cohort
   (n=29) was sub-grouped by age and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at
   rest. It was observed that the changes in exercise tolerance are
   significant in both comparisons, but most significant when sub-grouped
   by PVR at rest. Results showed that patients over 2 years old with high
   PVR are above or close to the upper tolerable limit of OER (0.32) at
   baseline. Patients with high PVR at rest had very poor exercise
   tolerance while patients with low PVR at rest could tolerate low
   exercise conditions. In general, ventricular function of SV patients is
   too poor to increase CI and fulfill exercise requirements. The presented
   mathematical model provides a framework to estimate the hemodynamic
   performance of BDG patients at different exercise levels according to
   patient specific data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has
   transformed HIV-1 infection from a terminal diagnosis to a chronic, yet
   manageable disease. However, people living with HIV-1 exhibit a host of
   non-AIDS-related co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Several HAART drugs have been implicated in the development of CVD;
   however, the role of efavirenz (EFV), a highly prescribed HAART drug, in
   early-onset CVD is poorly understood. We treated apolipoprotein E-null
   (ApoE(-/-)) mice with EFV (75 mg/kg/day) or vehicle, via oral gavage,
   for 35 days and quantified commonly measured preclinical markers of CVD
   (intima-media thickening, arterial stiffening) and plaque area.
   Suprarenal abdominal aortas were subjected to cylindrical biaxial
   biomechanical testing and standard histology. Aortas from EFV-treated
   mice demonstrated decreased compliance (i.e., increased arterial
   stiffness) and decreased axial force and a trend toward decreased in
   vivo axial stretch, but EFV treatment had no effect on intima-media
   thickness of the aortic wall or plaque coverage in thoracic aortas and
   aortic arches. Taken together, these data suggest that EFV leads to
   arterial stiffening but, for the dose and duration tested, did not lead
   to elevated plaque progression in ApoE(-/-) mice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Quantification of the black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC)
   components of source emissions is critical to understanding the impact
   combustion aerosols have on atmospheric light absorption.
   Multiple-wavelength absorption was measured from fuels including wood,
   agricultural biomass, coals, plant matter, and petroleum distillates in
   controlled combustion settings. Filter-based absorption measurements
   were corrected and compared to photoacoustic absorption results. BC
   absorption was segregated from the total light extinction to estimate
   the BrC absorption from individual sources. Results were compared to
   elemental carbon (EC)/organic carbon (OC) concentrations to determine
   composition's impact on light absorption. Multiple-wavelength absorption
   coefficients, Angstrom exponent (6.9 to <1.0), mass absorption cross
   section (MAC), and Delta C (97 mu gm(-3) to 0 mu gm(-3)) were highly
   variable. Sources such as incense and peat emissions showed ultraviolet
   wavelength (370nm) BrC absorption over 175 and 80 times (respectively)
   the BC absorption but only 21 and 11 times (respectively) at 520nm
   wavelength. The bulk EC MAC(EC,) (average at 520nm=9.03.7m(2)g(-1); with
   OC fraction <0.85=7.5m(2)g(-1)) and the BrC OC mass absorption cross
   sections (MAC(BrC,OC,)) were calculated; at 370nm ultraviolet
   wavelengths; the MAC(BrC,OC,) ranged from 0.8m(2)g(-1) to 2.29m(2)g(-1)
   (lowest peat, highest kerosene), while at 520nm wavelength MAC(BrC,OC,)
   ranged from 0.07m2g(-1) to 0.37m(2)g(-1) (lowest peat, highest
   kerosene/incense mixture). These MAC results show that OC content can be
   an important contributor to light absorption when present in significant
   quantities (>0.9 OC/TC), source emissions have variable absorption
   spectra, and nonbiomass combustion sources can be significant
   contributors to BrC.}},

Abstract = {{Rubrene is one of the most studied molecular semiconductors; its
   chemical structure consists of a tetracene backbone with four phenyl
   rings appended to the two central fused rings. Derivatization of these
   phenyl rings can lead to two very different solid-state molecular
   conformations and packings: One in which the tetracene core is planar
   and there exists substantive overlap among neighboring pi-conjugated
   backbones; and another where the tetracene core is twisted and the
   overlap of neighboring p-conjugated backbones is completely disrupted.
   State-of-the-art electronic structure calculations show for all isolated
   rubrene derivatives that the twisted conformation is more favorable (by
   -1.7 to -4.1 kcal mol(-1)), which is a consequence of energetically
   unfavorable exchangerepulsion interactions among the phenyl side groups.
   Calculations based on available crystallographic structures reveal that
   planar conformations of the tetracene core in the solid state result
   from intermolecular interactions that can be tuned through well-chosen
   functionalization of the phenyl side groups and lead to improved
   intermolecular electronic couplings. Understanding the interplay of
   these intramolecular and intermolecular interactions provides insight
   into how to chemically modify rubrene and similar molecular
   semiconductors to improve the intrinsic materials electronic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The number of cycles required to form and grow microstructurally small
   fatigue cracks in metals exhibits substantial variability, particularly
   for low applied strain amplitudes. This variability is commonly
   attributed to the heterogeneity of cyclic plastic deformation within the
   microstructure, and presents a challenge to minimum life design of
   fatigue resistant components. This paper analyzes sources of variability
   that contribute to the driving force of transgranular fatigue cracks
   within nucleant grains. We employ crystal plasticity finite element
   simulations that explicitly render the polycrystalline microstructure
   and Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FlPs) averaged over different volume
   sizes and shapes relative to the anticipated fatigue damage process
   zone. Volume averaging is necessary to both achieve description of a
   finite fatigue damage process zone and to regularize mesh dependence in
   simulations. Results from constant amplitude remote applied straining
   are characterized in terms of the extreme value distributions of volume
   averaged FlPs. Grain averaged FIP values effectively mitigate mesh
   sensitivity, but they smear out variability within grains. Volume
   averaging over bands that encompass critical transgranular slip planes
   appear to present the most attractive approach to mitigate mesh
   sensitivity while preserving variability within grains. Published by

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{A bioinspired multi-layer hydrogel was developed for the encapsulation
   of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as a platform for osteochondral
   tissue engineering. The spatial presentation of biochemical cues, via
   incorporation of extracellular matrix analogs, and mechanical cues, via
   both hydrogel crosslink density and externally applied mechanical loads,
   were characterized in each layer. A simple sequential
   photopolymerization method was employed to form stable poly(ethylene
   glycol)-based hydrogels with a soft cartilage-like layer of chondroitin
   sulfate and low RGD concentrations, a stiff bone-like layer with high
   RGD concentrations, and an intermediate interfacial layer. Under a
   compressive load, the variation in hydrogel stiffness within each layer
   produced high strains in the soft cartilage-like layer, low strains in
   the stiff bone-like layer, and moderate strains in the interfacial
   layer. When hMSC-laden hydrogels were cultured statically in
   osteochondral differentiation media, the local biochemical and matrix
   stiffness cues were not sufficient to spatially guide hMSC
   differentiation after 21 days. However dynamic mechanical stimulation
   led to differentially high expression of collagens with collagen II in
   the cartilage-like layer, collagen X in the interfacial layer and
   collagen I in the bone-like layer and mineral deposits localized to the
   bone layer. Overall, these findings point to external mechanical
   stimulation as a potent regulator of hMSC differentiation toward
   osteochondral cellular phenotypes. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) technology is promising for next generation
   wireless networks. It allows unlicensed secondary users to use the
   licensed spectrum bands as long as they do not cause unacceptable
   interference to the primary users who own those bands. To efficiently
   allocate resources in CR networks, stable resource allocation based on
   graph theory is investigated, which takes all users' preferences into
   account. In this paper, we focus on improving robustness of the stable
   matching based resource allocation. A truncated scheme generating almost
   stable matchings is first investigated. Based on the properties of the
   truncated scheme, two types of edge-cutting algorithms, called direct
   edge-cutting (DEC) and Gale-Shapley based edge-cutting (GSEC), are
   developed to improve resource allocation robustness to the channel state
   information variation. To mitigate the problem that certain secondary
   users may not be able to find suitable resources after edge-cutting,
   multi-stage (MS) algorithms are then proposed. Numerical results show
   that the proposed algorithms are robust to the channel state information
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is an emerging membrane based energy
   conversion process used to extract electricity by mixing two water
   streams of different salinities. This technique utilizes transport of
   cations and anions during controlled mixing of saltwater and freshwater
   through selective ion exchange membranes. The development of ion
   exchange membranes and optimization of system performance are crucial
   for sustainable energy capture from salinity gradients using RED.
   Recently, increased attention has been given to the preparation of ion
   exchange membranes and to understanding the factors that determine the
   RED power performance. This review evaluates potential ion exchange
   membrane materials, currently available state-of-the-art RED membranes,
   and their key properties. Discussion will focus on the electrochemical
   and physical properties of these membranes (e.g., resistance,
   permselectivity, and swelling) because of their significant role in RED
   performance throughout the system, Although an interconnected
   relationship exists between membrane properties, RED requires high
   quality membranes that are uniquely tailored to have a low resistance
   and high permselectivity. Moreover, harnessing this potential technology
   demands not only carefully optimized components but also a novel RED
   stack design and system optimization. The key findings and advancements
   needed to assure proper stack design and optimization are also
   described. This review paper's goal is to elucidate effective energy
   conversion from salinity gradients and expedite implementation of RED as
   the next promising renewable source of power for large-scale energy
   generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Prediction of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy using left
   ventricular pacing lead position and cardiovascular magnetic resonance
   derived wall motion patterns: a prospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite marked benefits in many heart failure patients, a
   considerable proportion of patients treated with cardiac
   resynchronization therapy (CRT) fail to respond appropriately. Recently,
   a ``U-shaped{''} (type II) wall motion pattern identified by
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been associated with
   improved CRT response compared to a homogenous (type I) wall motion
   pattern. There is also evidence that a left ventricular (LV) lead
   localized to the latest contracting LV site predicts superior response,
   compared to an LV lead localized remotely from the latest contracting LV
   site.
   Methods: We prospectively evaluated patients undergoing CRT with
   pre-procedural CMR to determine the presence of type I and type II wall
   motion patterns and pre-procedural echocardiography to determine end
   systolic volume (ESV). We assessed the final LV lead position on
   post-procedural fluoroscopic images to determine whether the lead was
   positioned concordant to or remote from the latest contracting LV site.
   CRT response was defined as a >= 15 \% reduction in ESV on a 6 month
   follow-up echocardiogram.
   Results: The study included 33 patients meeting conventional indications
   for CRT with a mean New York Heart Association class of 2.8 +/- 0.4 and
   mean LV ejection fraction of 28 +/- 9 \%. Overall, 55 \% of patients
   were echocardiographic responders by ESV criteria. Patients with both a
   type II pattern and an LV lead concordant to the latest contracting site
   (T2CL) had a response rate of 92 \%, compared to a response rate of 33
   \% for those without T2CL (p = 0.003). T2CL was the only independent
   predictor of response on multivariate analysis (odds ratio 18, 95 \%
   confidence interval 1.6-206; p = 0.018). T2CL resulted in significant
   incremental improvement in prediction of echocardiographic response
   (increase in the area under the receiver operator curve from 0.69 to
   0.84; p = 0.038).
   Conclusions: The presence of a type II wall motion pattern on CMR and a
   concordant LV lead predicts superior CRT response. Improving patient
   selection by evaluating wall motion pattern and targeting LV lead
   placement may ultimately improve the response rate to CRT.}},

Abstract = {{Polyelectrolyte capsules (PECs) are a promising delivery system that

   Controlling PEC properties is critical to understanding and tuning their

   biodistribution in the body. The lack of a method to independently
   engineer PEC size, shape, and chemistry impedes both basic understanding
   of how physicochemical parameters affect PEC behavior in drug delivery
   and other applications, and the ability to optimize parameters for best
   function. Here, we report the successful fabrication of PECs having
   constant surface chemistry with independently controlled size and shape
   by combining soft organic templates created by the particle stretching
   method and a modified layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition process. Changing
   the template dispersion solution during LBL deposition from water to
   ethanol allowed us to overcome previous issues with organic templates,
   such as aggregation and template removal. These results will contribute
   not only to the basic study of the role of capsule shape and size on its
   function but also to the optimization of capsule properties for drug or
   imaging carriers, sensors, reactors, and other applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present a photonic approach for generating low phase noise, arbitrary
   chirped microwave waveforms based on heterodyne beating between high
   order correlated comb lines extracted from frequency-agile optical
   frequency comb. Using the dual heterodyne phase transfer scheme,
   extrinsic phase noises induced by the separate optical paths are
   efficiently suppressed by 42-dB at 1-Hz offset frequency. Linearly
   chirped microwave waveforms are achieved within 30-ms temporal duration,
   contributing to a large time-bandwidth product. The linearity
   measurement leads to less than 90 kHz RMS frequency error during the
   entire chirp duration, exhibiting excellent linearity for the microwave
   and sub-THz waveforms. The capability of generating arbitrary waveforms
   up to sub-THz band with flexible temporal duration, long repetition
   period, broad bandwidth, and large time-bandwidth product is
   investigated and discussed. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a full-duplex radio-over-fiber
   (RoF) system with colorless upstream transmission based on orthogonal
   phase-correlated modulation (OPM). This new OPM scheme, which realized
   by a polarization rotator (PR) and a single-driver Mach-Zahnder
   modulator (MZM) at the central office (CO), achieves
   polarization-orthogonality between the optical carrier (OC) and
   subcarriers generated by radio frequency (RF) signals. By adjusting a
   polarization controller (PC) in the remote access units (RAU), different
   modulation schemes can be flexibly implemented, e.g. double-sideband
   (DSB) modulation for low RF service and optical carrier suppression
   (OCS) modulation for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) service. In the meantime,
   the OC can be reused for the upstream transmission without any filtering
   and additional PC. A proof-of-concept experiment is conducted to
   demonstrate the feasibility of proposed scheme, where downstream
   800-Mb/s orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal at 58
   GHz as an mm-wave service and 800-Mb/s OFDM signal at 0.3 GHz as a low
   frequency wireless service, as well as an upstream 1-Gb/s on-off keying
   (OOK) are simultaneously delivered in a shared architecture. By
   providing heterogeneous services and colorless upstream transmission,
   the proposed architecture can be seamlessly integrated in wavelength
   division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON). (C) 2015

   structures including microscopic rings, tubules, and helical tubules.
   This is a unique example of tailoring self-rolled 3D geometries through
   shape design without changing the inner morphology of active bimorph
   biomaterials. In contrast to traditional organic-soluble synthetic
   materials, we utilizeda biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymer that
   underwent a facile aqueous layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly process for the
   fabrication of 2D films. The resulting films can undergo reversible

Title = {{Glaucoma-related Changes in the Mechanical Properties and Collagen
   Micro-architecture of the Human Sclera}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The biomechanical behavior of the sclera determines the level of
   mechanical insult from intraocular pressure to the axons and tissues of
   the optic nerve head, as is of interest in glaucoma. In this study, we
   measure the collagen fiber structure and the strain response, and
   estimate the material properties of glaucomatous and normal human donor
   scleras.
   Methods
   Twenty-two posterior scleras from normal and diagnosed glaucoma donors
   were obtained from an eyebank. Optic nerve cross-sections were graded to
   determine the presence of axon loss. The specimens were subjected to
   pressure-controlled inflation testing. Full-field displacement maps were
   measured by digital image correlation (DIC) and spatially differentiated
   to compute surface strains. Maps of the collagen fiber structure across
   the posterior sclera of each inflated specimen were obtained using
   synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Finite element (FE)
   models of the posterior scleras, incorporating a specimen-specific
   representation of the collagen structure, were constructed from the
   DIC-measured geometry. An inverse finite element analysis was developed
   to estimate the stiffness of the collagen fiber and inter-fiber matrix.
   Results
   The differences between glaucoma and non-glaucoma eyes were small in
   magnitude. Sectorial variations of degree of fiber alignment and
   peripapillary scleral strain significantly differed between normal and
   diagnosed glaucoma specimens. Meridional strains were on average larger
   in diagnosed glaucoma eyes compared with normal specimens. Non-glaucoma
   specimens had on average the lowest matrix and fiber stiffness, followed
   by undamaged glaucoma eyes, and damaged glaucoma eyes but the
   differences in stiffness were not significant.
   Conclusion
   The observed biomechanical and microstructural changes could be the
   result of tissue remodeling occuring in glaucoma and are likely to alter
   the mechanical environment of the optic nerve head and contribute to
   axonal damage.}},

   The as-prepared crosslinked novolac epoxy resins were characterized by
   FT-IR, NMR, TGA, and DMA. The results indicate that the novel
   crosslinked novolac epoxy resins present higher storage modulus (2.37
   GPa at 30 degrees C) and excellent thermal stability (348 degrees C at
   5\% mass loss). Furthermore, the thermal reversible and self-healing
   properties were studied in detail by DSC, SEM, thermal re-solution, and

Abstract = {{As a result of van der Waal's interactions, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) tend
   to assemble into bundle/rope structures. It is essential to de-bundle
   and exfoliate CNTs in polymer solutions in order to utilize their
   reinforcement potential as far as possible. In this study, a variety of
   different processing conditions were used to prepare
   polyacrylonitrile/CNTs composite solutions. The CNT bundle diameter,
   length, and macro-scale dispersion homogeneity in those solutions were
   compared. It was observed that the CNT type, solvent type, and polymer
   concentration were important factors to determine the CNT bundle sizes
   in the solutions. The results are expected to be beneficial to obtain
   well-dispersed polymer/CNT nanocomposites. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

   slow diffusion process at room temperature, we used transition path
   sampling (TPS). The influence of framework flexibility on diffusion is
   investigated by combining TPS simulations with fully flexible molecular
   dynamics performed in the NpT ensemble. The ensemble of the collected
   reactive trajectories was used to characterize sets of transition
   states, and the corresponding configurations were analyzed to construct
   window size distributions during the molecular hopping events. The
   diffusion process is affected by framework flexibility, and the
   influence of framework flexibility on diffusion of propane and butane is
   much larger than for methane and ethane.}},

Abstract = {{Despite several attempts to synthesize water-expandable polystyrene
   (WEPS) beads, the product is still far from commercialization. This is
   mainly due to the inability of the PS beads to preserve the blowing
   agent (water) during storage, which leads to the loss of expandability.
   We report a new generation of WEPS beads with extended shelf life and
   good expandability. The beads were synthesized through Pickering
   emulsion polymerization in which cross-linked starch nanoparticles
   (CSTNs) were used as a water-stabilizing agent. Synthesized beads with
   different CSTN content could encapsulate 5.0-12 wt \% of the water
   droplets of 3-4 mu m in diameter. Thermogravirnetric analysis showed
   that the entrapped water is mainly bound water with a strong adsorption
   to the starch nanopartides. Over 88\% of the initial bound water content
   can be preserved 3 months after synthesis, thereby prolonging the shelf
   life of the CSTNWEPS beads. The expansion behavior of CSTNWEPS beads was
   investigated in hot oil and at an optimized temperature of 135 degrees
   C. The best results (expansion ratio of similar to 7 for as-synthesized
   beads and similar to 3 after 3 months) were obtained for the sample
   containing 1 wt \% of CSTN and 5.6 wt \% of water in the form of
   uniformly distributed microdroplets. Finally, the morphological
   investigation of the expanded beads revealed that the CSTNs not only
   stabilize the water microdroplets in the beads but also reinforce the
   foam during expansion and inhibit cell wall rupture.}},

Abstract = {{Composites consisting of nanoparticles of iron oxides and graphene have
   attracted considerable attention in numerous applications; however, the
   synthesis methods used to achieve superior functionalities are often
   complex and unamenable to low-cost large-scale industrial production.
   Here, we report our findings in exploring a simple strategy for low-cost
   fabrication of multifunctional composites with enhanced properties. In
   particular, we have successfully prepared FeO(OH) nanoflake/graphene and
   nano-Fe3O4/graphene composites from commercially available Fe powders
   and graphite oxides using a simple and low-cost solid-state process,
   where the metallic Fe is converted to FeO(OH) nanoflake and graphite
   oxide is reduced/exfoliated to graphene. The resultant
   nano-Fe3O4/graphene composite is multifunctional, demonstrates specific
   capacities of 802 and 629 mA h g(-1) respectively, at 1000 and 2000 mA
   as an electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and also
   displays efficient catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER); the nominal overpotentials
   are lower than those for previously reported metal-based catalysts
   (e.g., IrO2, RuO2, and Pt/C). The dramatically enhanced properties are
   attributed to the synergistic mechanochemical coupling effects between
   iron oxide and graphene introduced by the facile process, which is well
   suited for large-scale cost-effective fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Ceria (CeO2) nanofibers with high porosity are fabricated using an
   approach involving sol-gel, electrospinning, and calcination.
   Specifically, cerium(III) acetylacetonate and polyacrylonitrile (PAN)
   are dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and then electrospun into
   nanofibers. The PAN matrix plays a critical role in stabilizing the
   porous structure from collapse during calcination in air up to 800
   degrees C. CeO2 porous nanofibers comprising an interconnected network
   of single crystalline and fully oxidized CeO2 nanoparticles about 40 nm
   in size are obtained. The hierarchically porous structure of the CeO2
   nanofibers enables the facile deposition of Pt nanoparticles via
   heterogeneous nucleation in a photochemical method. When conducted in
   the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and 4-benzyolbenzoic acid,
   uniform Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.7 nm are
   obtained, which are evenly dispersed across the entire surface of each
   CeO2 nanofiber. The high porosity of CeO2 nanofibers and the uniform
   distribution of Pt nanoparticles greatly improve the activity and
   stability of this catalytic system toward the water-gas shift reaction.
   It is believed that this method could be extended to produce a variety
   of catalysts and systems sought for various industrial applications.}},

   favors larger MAE values relative to a statistical sample of
   configurations constructed with 96-atom supercells. The effect of
   lattice relaxations is shown to be small. Calculations of the Curie
   temperature for this alloy are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive cellular immunity requires accurate self-vs.
   nonself-discrimination to protect against infections and tumorous
   transformations while at the same time excluding autoimmunity. This
   vital capability is programmed in the thymus through selection of alpha
   beta T-cell receptors (alpha beta TCRs) recognizing peptides bound to
   MHC molecules (pMHC). Here, we show that the pre-TCR (preTCR), a pT
   alpha-beta heterodimer appearing before alpha beta TCR expression,
   directs a previously unappreciated initial phase of repertoire
   selection. Contrasting with the ligand-independent model of preTCR
   function, we reveal through NMR and bioforce-probe analyses that the
   beta-subunit binds pMHC using V beta complementarity-determining regions
   as well as an exposed hydrophobic V beta patch characteristic of the
   preTCR. Force-regulated single bonds akin to those of alpha beta TCRs
   but with more promiscuous ligand specificity trigger calcium flux. Thus,
   thymic development involves sequential beta- and then, alpha
   beta-repertoire tuning, whereby preTCR interactions with self pMHC
   modulate early thymocyte expansion, with implications for
   beta-selection, immunodominant peptide recognition, and germ
   line-encoded MHC interaction.}},

Title = {{Dynamics in atomic signaling games}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{376}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{We study an atomic signaling game under stochastic evolutionary
   dynamics. There are a finite number of players who repeatedly update
   from a finite number of available languages/signaling strategies.
   Players imitate the most fit agents with high probability or mutate with
   low probability. We analyze the longrun distribution of states and show
   that, for sufficiently small mutation probability, its support is
   limited to efficient communication systems. We find that this behavior
   is insensitive to the particular choice of evolutionary dynamic, a
   property that is due to the game having a potential structure with a
   potential function corresponding to average fitness. Consequently, the
   model supports conclusions similar to those found in the literature on
   language competition. That is, we show that efficient languages
   eventually predominate the society while reproducing the empirical
   phenomenon of linguistic drift. The emergence of efficiency in the
   atomic case can be contrasted with results for non-atomic signaling
   games that establish the non-negligible possibility of convergence,
   under replicator dynamics, to states of unbounded efficiency loss. (C)

Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a time-delay estimation method based on Ensemble Local
   Mean Decomposition (ELMD) method and high-order ambiguity function (HAF)
   is proposed for locating natural gas pipeline leaks. The leakage signals
   were decomposed using ELMD, and numerous production functions (PFs) were
   obtained. An adaptive selection method based on Kullback-Leibler (K-L)
   divergence was proposed to process these PF components and choose the
   characteristic PFs that contain most of the leakage information. The RAF
   was employed to analyze the instantaneous parameters of the
   characteristic PFs and calculate the difference in arrival time of
   characteristic frequencies. From the time difference and the signal
   propagation speed, the natural gas pipeline leakage location can be
   determined. The experiment results show that the proposed method can
   locate leaks with higher accuracy than cross-correlation method. (C)

Title = {{Quantification of the passive and active biaxial mechanical behaviour

Abstract = {{Mechanical loading conditions are likely to play a key role in passive
   and active (contractile) behaviour of lymphatic vessels. The development
   of a microstructurally motivated model of lymphatic tissue is necessary
   for quantification of mechanically mediated maladaptive remodelling in
   the lymphatic vasculature. Towards this end, we performed cylindrical
   biaxial testing of Sprague Dawley rat thoracic ducts (n = 6) and
   constitutive modelling to characterize their mechanical behaviour.
   Spontaneous contraction was quantified at transmural pressures of 3,6
   and 9 cmH(2)O. Cyclic inflation in calcium-free saline was performed at
   fixed axial stretches between 1.30 and 1.60, while recording pressure,
   outer diameter and axial force. A microstructurally motivated four-fibre
   family constitutive model originally proposed by Holzapfel et al.
   (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1-48.
   (doi:10.1023/A:1010835316564)) was used to quantify the passive
   mechanical response, and the model of Rachev and Hayashi was used to
   quantify the active (contractile) mechanical response. The average error
   between data and theory was 8.9 +/- 0.8\% for passive data and 6.6 +/-
   2.6\% and 6.8 +/- 3.4\% for the systolic and basal conditions,
   respectively, for active data. Multi-photon microscopy was performed to
   quantify vessel wall thickness (32.2 +/- 1.60 mu m) and elastin and
   collagen organization for three loading conditions. Elastin exhibited
   structural `fibre families' oriented nearly circumferentially and
   axially. Sample-to-sample variation was observed in collagen fibre
   distributions, which were often non-wdsymmetric, suggesting material
   asymmetry. In closure, this paper presents a microstructurally motivated
   model that accurately captures the biaxial active and passive mechanical
   behaviour in lymphatics and offers potential for future research to
   identify parameters contributing to mechanically mediated disease
   development.}},

Abstract = {{A direct liquid fuel injection/variable volume reactor integrated with a
   hydrogen selective membrane (CHAMP-DDIR) has been recently shown to be a
   promising new concept for hydrogen production in portable and
   distributed applications. The CHAMP-DDIR reactor performance has been
   analyzed using a simplified transport model with which conditions for
   maximum performance, e.g. highest volumetric power density, were
   identified. A prototype reactor demonstrated the ability to realize
   performance improvement, while also indicating a need for more a
   rigorous model for accurate exploration of the design and operation
   space. In this paper, we present a comprehensive reactor model which
   carefully considers the effects of heat and mass transfer, including
   rigorous treatment of multicomponent species transport. The model is
   validated against experimental results through comparison of predicted
   and measured hydrogen production rate, reactor pressure, and
   temperature. The experimentally validated model is used to identify the
   relationship between CHAMP-DDIR design and operating parameters and the
   rate-limiting processes that govern reactor output. In addition, effects
   of heat and mass transfer limitations on CHAMP-DDIR performance are
   investigated by comparing the predictions among multiple cases with
   increasing level of complexity used for modeling the transport phenomena
   within the reactor. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Optogenetic techniques enable precise excitation and inhibition of
   firing in specified neuronal populations and artifact-free recording of
   firing activity. Several studies have suggested that optical stimulation
   provides the precision and dynamic range requisite for closed-loop
   neuronal control, but no approach yet permits feedback control of
   neuronal firing. Here we present the `optoclamp', a feedback control
   technology that provides continuous, real-time adjustments of
   bidirectional optical stimulation in order to lock spiking activity at
   specified targets over timescales ranging from seconds to days. We
   demonstrate how this system can be used to decouple neuronal firing
   levels from ongoing changes in network excitability due to multi-hour
   periods of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission blockade in
   vitro as well as impinging vibrissal sensory drive in vivo. This
   technology enables continuous, precise optical control of firing in
   neuronal populations in order to disentangle causally related variables
   of circuit activation in a physiologically and ethologically relevant

Abstract = {{Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry is used to study the
   three-dimensional flow field over a retreating rotor blade in dynamic
   stall. The dynamic stall event is characterized from the inception of
   dynamic flow separation through dynamic reattachment on the rotating
   blade at one radial location. First, the separation event is studied by
   characterizing the dynamic separation mechanism in action and the effect
   of advance ratio on the onset of dynamic separation. Next, the vortex
   dynamics and the associated cycle-to-cycle variations during the dynamic
   stall event are characterized. The radial component of flow (from root
   to blade tip) during the dynamic stall event is shown to be significant
   in the rotating environment. Proper orthogonal decomposition is used to
   characterize the unsteady nature of the dominant flow structure.
   Comparisons of the phase-averaged and instantaneous velocity fields show
   the dynamic stall vortex to be spatially diffused. These results imply
   significant effects on the pitching moment variation from cycle to cycle
   since the effective center of the vortex appears to occur at different
   locations in every cycle. Finally, the last phase of dynamic stall, the
   dynamic reattachment phase on the rotating blade, is investigated.
   Dynamic reattachment was observed to be affected by advance ratio with
   an increase in advance ratio resulting in early dynamic reattachment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a lifetime reliability characterization of many-core
   processors based on a full-system simulation of integrated
   microarchitecture, power, thermal, and reliability models. Under normal
   operating conditions, our model and analysis reveal that the
   mean-time-to-failure of cores on the die show normal distribution. From
   the processor-level perspective, the key insight is that reducing the
   variance of the distribution can improve lifetime reliability by
   avoiding early failures. Based on this understanding, we present two
   variance reduction techniques for proactive reliability management; i)
   proportional dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) and ii)
   coordinated thread swapping. A major advantage of using variance
   reduction techniques is that the improvement of system lifetime
   reliability can be achieved without adding design margins or spare
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based nitrogen self-doped hierarchical porous carbon aerogels
   were synthesized for supercapacitor electrode application by using
   chitosan as a raw material through a carefully controlled aerogel
   formation-carbonization-activation process. The as-synthesized N-doped
   graphene-based carbon aerogels contained both macropores and mesopores
   from the aerogel preparation and carbonization process, and micropores
   from the chemical activation, confirmed by TEM, SEM, BET, etc. Because
   chitosan is a nitrogen-containing renewable biopolymer, the carbon
   aerogel derived from chitosan in this work was N-self -doped. The
   carbonized carbon aerogel was composed of a graphene framework and
   amorphous carbon, and the ratio between these two components was
   controlled by the activation temperature. With an increase in activation
   temperature, the amorphous carbon was etched away gradually, and a
   stable graphene portion remained to form a framework. Accordingly, the
   performance of the graphene-based carbon aerogel as a supercapacitor
   varied with increasing activation temperature. Electrochemical
   investigation measurements showed that the N-doped graphene-based
   hierarchical porous carbon aerogel represents a good electrode candidate
   for construction of a solid symmetric supercapacitor, which displays a
   high specific capacitance of about 197 F g(-1) at a current density of
   0.2 A g(-1). In addition, the solid state supercapacitor displayed

Abstract = {{Hydropower is the most important and wildly-used renewable energy source
   in the environment. In this paper, we demonstrate a multi-layered
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to effectively harvest the water wave
   energy. For a single-layered TENG, interdigitive electrodes are
   incorporated in order to generate multiple electric outputs under water
   wave or water drop impact. For the collection of water wave energy, a
   polyurethane (PU) coated copper rod is used to roll back and forth and
   contact with the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film covered
   interdigitative electrodes. The surfaces of the PU and PTFE films are
   fabricated as porous structures and nanowire arrays, which provide an
   advantages of large contact area and efficient separation. Under one
   wave impact, the single-layered TENG composed of nine pairs of
   interdigitative electrodes can provide nine pulses of electric outputs
   (each pulsed output voltage is 52 V and output current density is 13.8
   mA m(-2)). The instantaneous output power density of a five-layered TENG
   is 1.1 W m(-2). In addition, the PTFE film covered interdigitative
   electrodes has been successfully used to harvest water drop energy,
   whcih can also generate 9 pulses of electric outputs upon one water drop
   falling. All these results show the developed TENG has a potential to
   harvest the hydropower of ocean wave and raindrop in the near future.

Abstract = {{Fresh water for human daily life is an important resource of the world,
   which could be as precious as oil in many cases. The increased needs for
   fresh water are becoming a major challenge to the quality of our life.
   Recently much attention has been paid to the seawater desalination with
   low energy cost. Here we report a seawater desalination (SD) and
   electrolysis (SE) system on the basis of the newly invented
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The TENG consists of radial arrays
   of micro-sized sectors on the contact surfaces and exhibits a high
   output current of 3.3 mA. 0.5 M salt solution was desalinated to form
   drinking water in 16 h and the desalination rate reached 98.3\%.
   Subsequently, a totally self-powered SD and SE system driven by the
   kinetic energy of flowing water was presented. Using the power generated
   by flowing water at a rate of 40 L min(-1), the desalination rate
   reaches 8.2\% in 3 h. Furthermore, the byproduct of concentrated salty
   water was split at a hydrogen production rate of 2.6 x 10(-5) mL s(-1).
   Our study demonstrates an innovative and unique approach toward a total
   self-powered SD and SE system. This is an important step toward
   self-powered environmental electrochemistry. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Sound energy is one kind of the most widely distributed energies in the
   environment. Harvesting the sound energy, reducing noise and converting
   it into electricity have great potential to power nano/microsensors for
   internet of things, structure monitoring, environment monitoring, etc.
   Based on electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers, we have
   fabricated a sound driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that can
   work stably in broad bandwidth ranging from 50 Hz to 425 Hz. Its maximum
   output current reaches up to 0.45 mA and its charging rate is 61 mu C/s.
   Furthermore, the TENG continuously worked for 7 days and vibrated 100
   million cycles, no decay in output signal was observed. The high
   performance and good robustness provide with great prospect to scavenge
   the noise energy in environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present study, we have successfully fabricated thermally reduced
   graphene oxide (TRGO) nanosheets on a flexible carbon fabric and
   demonstrated their implementation as a binder-free electrode for a
   flexible supercapacitor. The electrochemical measurements revealed that
   the flexible solid-state supercapacitor delivered a high device
   capacitance of 70.4 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) with excellent flexibility.
   Further, the capability of the device was demonstrated by driving a
   green and red light-emitting diodes for 15 min. Finally, we demonstrated
   its viability in a self-powered photosensor application by integrating
   the fabric supercapacitor device with a nanogenerator and photosensor.
   Our results suggest that a flexible TRGO-coated fabric has great
   potential in energy storage devices for self-powered nanosystems as well
   as a flexible, wearable, micro-power source. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   nanogenerator. And we further integrated it with a new kind of
   transmitter into a wireless, power-free and implantable nanosystem for
   in-vivo biodetection. This nanosystem does not need any electrical

Abstract = {{Composition design and morphology control can lead to high performance
   electrode materials for energy storage devices. In this work a
   graphene/porous Fe2O3 nanocomposite anode material is fabricated via a
   template-assisted nanocasting process. This nanocomposite consists of
   graphene scaffold with high electronic conductivity and interconnected
   Fe2O3 with porous structure, thus exposing ample active sites for redox
   reactions and offering sufficient contacts with the electrolyte. Owing
   to these morphological advantages, the nanocomposite outperforms nearly
   all the reported Fe-based anode materials by delivering a high specific
   capacitance of 1095 F g(-1) at a current density of 3 A g(-1). In
   addition, the material shows great rate capability and good cycling
   stability. Asymmetric supercapacitors are fabricated by assembling the
   graphene/porous Fe2O3 nanocomposite (as the anode material) with a
   CoNi-layered double hydroxide/carbon nanotube composite (as the cathode
   material). The devices exhibit high energy and power densities of 98.0 W
   h kg(-1) and 22,826 W kg(-1), which are among the best performances
   reported to date for asymmetric supercapacitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Given the importance of stakeholder considerations to the aircraft's
   overall mission and lifecycle performance, this work examines how
   stakeholder requirements are currently incorporated into the aircraft

   human factors specialists are designated to address specific stakeholder
   considerations within the design process. This research explores how the
   perspectives of these specialists are integrated into aircraft design
   teams. Accounts from 25 semistructured interviews were analyzed using
   qualitative data analysis techniques. The results identify differences
   between the integration of stakeholder considerations within the pilot
   compartment group compared to other design groups. These differences can
   be described through six conditions related to group structure and
   goals, approaches to cross-disciplinary work, and shared language and
   mediums of translation among disciplines. These results highlight how to
   promote the integration of stakeholder concerns in complex systems
   design through the structure of design teams and groups, their goals,
   their resources, the choice of team members, and training for future and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a haptic telepresence system that enables visually
   impaired users to explore locations with rich visual observation such as
   art galleries and museums by using a telepresence robot, a RGB-D sensor
   (color and depth camera), and a haptic interface. The recent improvement
   on RGB-D sensors has enabled real-time access to 3D spatial information
   in the form of point clouds. However, the real-time representation of
   this data in the form of tangible haptic experience has not been
   challenged enough, especially in the case of telepresence for
   individuals with visual impairments. Thus, the proposed system addresses
   the real-time haptic exploration of remote 3D information through video
   encoding and real-time 3D haptic rendering of the remote real-world
   environment. This paper investigates two scenarios in haptic
   telepresence, i.e., mobile navigation and object exploration in a remote
   environment. Participants with and without visual impairments
   participated in our experiments based on the two scenarios, and the
   system performance was validated. In conclusion, the proposed framework
   provides a new methodology of haptic telepresence for individuals with
   visual impairments by providing an enhanced interactive experience where
   they can remotely access public places (art galleries and museums) with
   the aid of haptic modality and robotic telepresence.}},

Abstract = {{The interface shear behavior of granular materials is central to many
   engineering applications, including the performance of structures like
   deep foundations, landfills, and retaining walls. Consequently, it is
   paramount to understand the behavior of construction material-soil
   interfaces involved in these applications. Furthermore, it has been
   shown that the study of interface behavior, in the laboratory and
   in-situ, can provide robust information about the soil's properties and
   engineering performance. This paper presented laboratory evaluations of
   micro and meso-scale shear deformation of medium-sized sands aimed at
   developing an improved fundamental understanding of granular-continuum
   stress-strain behavior. A comparison of interface testing results from
   two different shear directions-axial and torsional-demonstrated that the
   evolution and progression of shear zone formation was affected
   differently by changes in the interface surface roughness and particle
   angularity. In particular, it was observed that torsional shear is a
   more dilative process that induces a larger degree of soil shearing and
   is greatly affected by particle angularity. Studies of shear-induced
   volume changes also revealed that the influence zone for torsional
   shearing is larger than that for axial shearing, with soil dilation
   occurring inside the shear zone in contact with the material counterface
   and soil contraction in a surrounding outer zone. Fundamental
   micromechanical processes that aim to explain the differences between
   the behavior of axial and torsional tests are proposed.}},

Title = {{Co-pyrolysis of biomass tar and iron ore fines for the production of
   direct reduced iron}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Biomass tar can be used as reducing agent for reduction of iron oxide,
   and simultaneously iron is a good catalyst for tar cracking. Thus, an
   iron ore reduction system integrated tar cracking and iron ore reduction
   was proposed. The influences of raw material characteristics, the
   equivalence ratio of tar to iron ore fines as well as reduction
   conditions on the reduction behaviors of iron ore fines were discussed.
   Also, the co-pyrolysis of mixture of tar and iron ore fines was
   investigated. The results show that the iron ore reduction using tar is
   reliable with a high tar cracking efficiency and a high reduction
   degree. Due to the formation of porous structures, preheated iron ore
   fines showed an excellent reduction behavior than those without
   preheating. At the initial stage, iron oxide did not exert any obvious
   effect on tar destruction, while as reaction temperature raised above
   600 degrees C, a noticeable decline of tar content was observed, which
   was attributed to the enhanced reduction consumption and catalytic
   decomposition by the reduced iron. Increasing the ratio of tar to iron
   ore was favorable for the reduction of iron oxide, while, when the ratio
   exceeding 0.6, the effect became less notable. The introduction of
   proper amount of steam can improve tar cracking and further improve iron
   oxide reduction. At optimum conditions (iron ore fines was first
   preheated at 400 degrees C and then mixed with tar according to tar/iron
   ore fines 0.6, reacted at 900 degrees C for 30 min under the steam
   atmosphere with the mass ratio of steam/tar 0.87), the reduced iron
   product with metallization rate 94.1\% was achieved. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{A new method combined microbial fuel cell (MFC) with polycrystalline
   silicon solar cell (PSSC) was exploited to investigate its energy
   generation and its performance on the removal of hexavalent chromium
   (Cr(VI)). The open circuit voltage (Vocv) of MFC-PSSC could reach 3.540
   V, which, to our best knowledge, was the maximum Vocv of MFC reported.
   The power density of MFC-PSSC was 754.4 mW.m(-2) under simulated solar
   light irradiation, which increased by 990\% compared to 76.2 mW.m(-2) of
   a single MFC. The concentration of Cr(VI) in MFC was 17.06 mg.l(-1),
   which was around 12.6 times higher than that in the MFC-PSSC (1.35
   mg.l(-1)) after operation of 48 h. The concentration of chemical oxygen
   demand in MFC (264 mg.l(-1)) was around 6 times higher than that in the
   MFC-PSSC (44mg.l(-1)) after operation of 48 h. This study would provide
   a new insight into the energy generation from MFC coupling with solar

Abstract = {{Tidal currents are a promising source for future power generation given
   their periodicity and predictability. Therefore, numerical hydrodynamic
   models are frequently utilized for resource assessments. However, the
   relevant scales of the simulations and hence modeling techniques depend
   on the problem at hand. This paper shows the potential of the grid
   refinement technique for the assessment of tidal current energy for
   particular sites given its relatively low computational expense and high
   accuracy for the regions with the refined resolution. Example
   applications are described for mapping the tidal resources near two
   facilities ( Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine and Key West Naval
   Station in Florida) for possible future deployments of Marine
   Hydro-Kinetic technologies. The grid refinement capability in the
   coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave-sediment transport modeling system is used
   to improve the spatial resolution in the regions of interest, and has
   shown significant advantage over the original simulation results for the
   tidal power assessment. The numerical simulation results from both the
   original coarse grids and the refined grids are validated with measured
   tidal constituents at available locations. This study demonstrates how
   the enhancement of a model system for a regional tidal energy with grid
   refinement can assist with the performance of site specific resource
   assessments with modest computational expense. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Modeling Inhibitory Interneurons in Efficient Sensory Coding Models}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is still much unknown regarding the computational role of
   inhibitory cells in the sensory cortex. While modeling studies could
   potentially shed light on the critical role played by inhibition in
   cortical computation, there is a gap between the simplicity of many
   models of sensory coding and the biological complexity of the inhibitory
   subpopulation. In particular, many models do not respect that inhibition
   must be implemented in a separate subpopulation, with those inhibitory
   interneurons having a diversity of tuning properties and characteristic
   E/I cell ratios. In this study we demonstrate a computational framework
   for implementing inhibition in dynamical systems models that better
   respects these biophysical observations about inhibitory interneurons.
   The main approach leverages recent work related to decomposing matrices
   into low-rank and sparse components via convex optimization, and
   explicitly exploits the fact that models and input statistics often have
   low-dimensional structure that can be exploited for efficient
   implementations. While this approach is applicable to a wide range of
   sensory coding models (including a family of models based on Bayesian
   inference in a linear generative model), for concreteness we demonstrate
   the approach on a network implementing sparse coding. We show that the
   resulting implementation stays faithful to the original coding goals
   while using inhibitory interneurons that are much more biophysically
   plausible.}},

Abstract = {{Amplification of multiple unique genetic targets using the polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) is commonly required in molecular biology
   laboratories. Such reactions are typically performed either serially or
   by multiplex PCR. Serial reactions are time consuming, and multiplex
   PCR, while powerful and widely used, can be prone to amplification bias,
   PCR drift, and primer-primer interactions. We present a new
   thermocycling method, termed thermal multiplexing, in which a single
   heat source is uniformly distributed and selectively modulated for
   independent temperature control of an array of PCR reactions. Thermal
   multiplexing allows amplification of multiple targets
   simultaneously-each reaction segregated and performed at optimal
   conditions. We demonstrate the method using a microfluidic system
   consisting of an infrared laser thermocycler, a polymer microchip
   featuring 1 mu l, oil-encapsulated reactions, and closed-loop pulsewidth
   modulation control. Heat transfer modeling is used to characterize
   thermal performance limitations of the system. We validate the model and
   perform two reactions simultaneously with widely varying annealing
   temperatures (48 degrees C and 68 degrees C), demonstrating excellent
   amplification. In addition, to demonstrate microfluidic infrared PCR
   using clinical specimens, we successfully amplified and detected both
   influenza A and B from human nasopharyngeal swabs. Thermal multiplexing
   is scalable and applicable to challenges such as pathogen detection
   where patients presenting non-specific symptoms need to be efficiently
   screened across a viral or bacterial panel. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The traffic alert and collision avoidance system has been implemented to
   reduce the number of midair collisions. Pilot compliance to traffic
   alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisories is mandated
   unless the pilot feels it would conflict with safety. Thus, pilots'
   responses hinge on their assessment of the situation during the time
   period leading up to and spanning a traffic alert and collision
   avoidance system resolution advisory, including assessment of cues that
   conflict with traffic alert and collision avoidance system guidance.
   However, current training programs generally do not incorporate a
   realistic operating context and represent traffic alert and collision
   avoidance system advisories as isolated events. Furthermore, in the
   presence of conflicting traffic alert and collision avoidance system
   guidance and traffic information, pilots have reported confusion about
   what traffic alert and collision avoidance system advised, as well as
   disagreement with and noncompliance to resolution advisories. This paper
   discusses a traffic alert and collision avoidance system training
   program within a realistic operating context; in this case, the training
   used an integrated flight-deck/air-traffic-control simulator to create
   contexts where pilots receive conflicting information from the traffic
   alert and collision avoidance system and air traffic control. This
   training significantly impacted pilot responses to resolution
   advisories, including an increase in compliance when presented
   conflicting information.}},

Abstract = {{Shredded rubber tire is a geomaterial that is potentially useful in
   environmental and engineering projects. Here, we study the effect of
   particle size ratio on the thermal conductivity of granular mixtures
   containing rubber tire particles. Glass beads were mixed at various
   volume fractions with rubber particles of varying size. The 3D network
   model analysis using synthetic packed assemblies was used to determine
   the dominant factors influencing the thermal conduction of the mixtures.
   Results present that mixtures with varying size ratios exhibit different
   nonlinear evolutions of thermal conductivity values with mixture
   fractions. In particular, mixtures with large insulating materials
   (e.g., rubber particles) have higher thermal conduction that those with
   small ones. This is because the larger insulating particles allow better
   interconnectivity among the conductive particles, thereby avoiding the
   interruption of the thermal conduction of the conductive particles.
   Similar tests conducted with natural sand corroborate the significant
   effect of the relative size of the insulating particles. The 3D network
   model identifies the heterogeneity of local and effective thermal
   conductivity and the influence of connectivity among conductive
   particles. A supplementary examination of electrical conductivity
   highlights the significance of local and long-range connectivity on
   conduction paths in granular mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are compounds consisting of a
   transition-metal M (Ti, Hf, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Tc, Re, Pd, Pt) and
   chalcogen atoms X (S, Se, Te). There are approximately 60 compounds in
   the metal chalcogenide family, and two-thirds of them are in the form of
   layered structures where the in-plane bonds are strong (covalent), and
   the out-of-plane bonds are weak (van der Waals). This provides a means
   to mechanically or chemically thin (exfoliate) these materials down to a
   single atomic two-dimensional (2D) layer. While graphene, the 2D form of
   graphite, is metallic, the layered metal chalcogenides cover a wide
   range of electrical properties, from true metals (NbS2) and
   superconductors (TaS2) to semiconductors (MoS2) with a wide range of
   bandgaps and offsets. Multiple techniques are currently being developed
   to synthesize large-area monolayers, including alloys, and lateral and
   vertical heterostructures. The wide range of properties and the ability
   to tune them on an atomic scale has led to numerous applications in
   electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and energy. This article provides
   an introduction to TMDCs, serving as a background for the articles in
   this issue of MRS Bulletin.}},

Title = {{Velocimetry of cathode particles in a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster
   discharge plasma}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With high-speed imaging, it is possible to directly observe the
   time-evolution of the macroscopic behavior of the discharge plasma in a
   magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (MPDT). By utilizing direct high-speed
   imaging capable of capturing many images over the course of a single
   discharge, the velocity of the cathode erosion particles can be
   measured, opening the possibility of a novel, noninvasive technique for
   discharge plasma flow field velocimetry. In this work, an 8 kA argon
   MPDT discharge is imaged at 26 173 fps utilizing a 0.9 neutral density
   filter. The camera is aligned with thruster centerline 4 m downstream of
   the thruster exit plane. By tracking visible particles appearing in the
   multiple images, the particle motion in the radial and azimuthal
   directions is directly imaged. Through the use of traditional techniques
   in digital particle image velocimetry, the cathode particles emanating
   from the discharge are measured to have a mean radial velocity of 44.6
   +/- 6.0 m/s with a 95\% confidence interval and a statistically
   insignificant azimuthal velocity. The setup and analysis employed
   permits measurement of the particle velocity in orthogonal direction to
   the image sensor plane using a single camera. By combining a background
   removal subtraction technique and knowledge of the optical focal plane,
   the estimated mean axial velocity of the particles is 1.59 km/s. This
   investigation ends with a discussion of important factors to consider
   for future MPDT high-speed imaging particle velocimetry, such as
   frame-rate, image size, spatial resolution, optics, and data handling
   selections. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Although a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been developed to be
   an efficient approach to harvest mechanical energy, its robustness and
   lifetime are still to be improved through an effective and widely
   applicable way. Here, we show a rational designing methodology for
   achieving a significant improvement of the long-term stability of TENGs
   through automatic transition between contact and noncontact working
   states. This is realized by structurally creating two opposite forces in
   the moving part of the TENG, in which the pulling-away force is
   controlled by external mechanical motions. In this way, TENGs can work
   in the noncontact state with minimum surface wear and also transit into
   contact state intermittently to maintain high triboelectric charge
   density. A wind-driven disk-based TENG and a rotary barrel-based TENG
   that can realize automatic state transition under different wind speeds
   and rotation speeds, respectively, have been demonstrated as two
   examples, in which their robustness has been largely improved through
   this automatic transition. This methodology will further expand the
   practical application of TENGs for long-time usage and for harvesting
   mechanical energies with fluctuating intensities.}},

Abstract = {{We report a flexible and area-scalable energy-harvesting technique for
   converting kinetic wave energy. Triboelectrification as a result of
   direct interaction between a dynamic wave and a large-area
   nanostructured solid surface produces an induced current among an array
   of electrodes. An integration method ensures that the induced current
   between any pair of electrodes can be constructively added up, which
   enables significant enhancement in output power and realizes
   area-scalable integration of electrode arrays. Internal and external
   factors that affect the electric output are comprehensively discussed.
   The produced electricity not only drives small electronics but also
   achieves effective impressed current cathodic protection. This type of
   thin-film-based device is a potentially practical solution of on-site
   sustained power supply at either coastal or off-shore sites wherever a
   dynamic wave is available. Potential applications include corrosion
   protection, pollution degradation, water desalination, and wireless

Abstract = {{The Mars Science Laboratory entry vehicle successfully landed the

   inverse estimation of the entry vehicle's surface heating and heatshield
   material properties. The surface heating is estimated using the flight
   temperature data from the shallowest thermocouple. The sensitivity of
   the estimated surface heating profile to estimation tuning parameters,
   measurement errors, recession uncertainty, and material property
   uncertainty is investigated. A Monte Carlo analysis is conducted to
   quantify the uncertainty bounds associated with the nominal estimated
   surface heating. Additionally, a thermocouple driver approach is
   employed to estimate heatshield material properties using the flight

Abstract = {{In this paper, a state-space implementation of a previously developed
   frequency-domain model of the cochlea is coupled to a lumped parameter
   model of the middle ear. After validation of the time-domain model by
   comparison of its steady-state response to results obtained with a
   frequency-domain formulation, the nonlinear response of the cochlea to
   clicks is investigated. As observed experimentally, a compressive
   nonlinearity progressively develops within the first few cycles of the
   response of the basilar membrane (BM). Furthermore, a time-frequency
   analysis shows that the instantaneous frequency of the BM response to a
   click progressively approaches the characteristic frequency. This
   phenomenon, called glide, is predicted at all stimulus intensities, as
   in experiments. In typical experiments with sensitive animals, the click
   response is characterized by a long ringing and the response envelope
   includes several lobes. In order to achieve similar results,
   inhomogeneities are introduced in the cochlear model. Simulations
   demonstrate the strong link between characteristics of the frequency
   response, such as dispersion and frequency-dependent nonlinearity, and
   characteristics of the time-domain response, such as the glide and a
   time-dependent nonlinearity. The progressive buildup of cochlear
   nonlinearity in response to a click is shown to be a consequence of the
   glide and of frequency-dependent nonlinearity. (C) 2015 Acoustical

Abstract = {{The emergence of two-dimensional electronic materials has stimulated
   proposals of novel electronic and photonic devices based on the
   heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides. Here we report the
   determination of band offsets in the heterostructures of transition
   metal dichalcogenides by using microbeam X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy. We
   determine a type-II alignment between MoS2 and WSe2 with a valence band
   offset value of 0.83 eV and a conduction band offset of 0.76 eV.
   First-principles calculations show that in this heterostructure with
   dissimilar chalcogen atoms, the electronic structures of WSe2 and MoS2
   are well retained in their respective layers due to a weak interlayer
   coupling. Moreover, a valence band offset of 0.94 eV is obtained from
   density functional theory, consistent with the experimental
   determination.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Molecular ions can be held in a chain of laser-cooled atomic ions by
   sympathetic cooling. This system is ideal for performing high-precision
   molecular spectroscopy with applications in astrochemistry and
   fundamental physics. Here we show that this same system can be coupled
   with a broadband laser to discover new molecular transitions. We use
   three-ion chains of Ca+ and CaH+ to observe vibrational transitions via
   resonance-enhanced multiphoton dissociation detected by Ca+
   fluorescence. On the basis of theoretical calculations, we assign the
   observed peaks to the transition from the ground vibrational state, nu =
   0 to nu = 9 and 10. Our method allows us to track single-molecular
   events, and it can be extended to work with any molecule by using normal
   mode frequency shifts to detect the dissociation. This survey
   spectroscopy serves as a bridge to the precision spectroscopy required
   for molecular ion control.}},

Abstract = {{Ballistocardiography, the measurement of the reaction forces of the body
   to cardiac ejection of blood, is one of the few techniques available for
   unobtrusively assessing the mechanical aspects of cardiovascular health
   outside clinical settings. Recently, multiple experimental studies
   involving healthy subjects and subjects with various cardiovascular
   diseases have demonstrated that the ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal can
   be used to trend cardiac output, contractility, and beat-by-beat
   ventricular function for arrhythmias. The majority of these studies has
   been performed with ``fixed{''} BCG instrumentation-such as weighing
   scales or chairs-rather than wearable measurements. Enabling wearable,
   and thus continuous, recording of BCG signals would greatly expand the
   capabilities of the technique; however, BCG signals measured using
   wearable devices are morphologically dissimilar to measurements from
   ``fixed{''} instruments, precluding the analysis and interpretation
   techniques from one domain to be applied to the other. In particular,
   the time intervals between the electrocardiogram (ECG) and BCG-namely,
   the R-J interval, a surrogate for measuring contractility changes-are
   significantly different for the accelerometer compared to a ``fixed{''}
   BCG measurement. This paper addresses this need for quantitatively
   normalizing wearable BCG measurement to ``fixed{''} measurements with a
   systematic experimental approach. With these methods, the same analysis
   and interpretation techniques developed over the past decade for
   ``fixed{''} BCG measurement can be successfully translated to wearable
   measurements.}},

Title = {{A BDD-Based Approach for Designing Maximally Permissive Deadlock
   Avoidance Policies for Complex Resource Allocation Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{990-1006}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In order to develop a computationally efficient implementation of the
   maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) for complex
   resource allocation systems (RAS), a recent approach focuses on the
   identification of a set of critical states of the underlying RAS
   state-space, referred to as minimal boundary unsafe states. The
   availability of this information enables an expedient one-step-lookahead
   scheme that prevents the RAS from reaching outside its safe region. The
   work presented in this paper seeks to develop a symbolic approach, based
   on binary decision diagrams (BDDs), for efficiently retrieving the
   (minimal) boundary unsafe states from the underlying RAS state-space.
   The presented results clearly demonstrate that symbolic computation
   enables the deployment of the maximally permissive DAP for complex RAS
   with very large structure and state-spaces with limited time and memory
   requirements. Furthermore, the involved computational costs are
   substantially reduced through the pertinent exploitation of the special
   structure that exists in the considered problem.
   Note to Practitioners-A key component of the real-time control of many
   flexibly automated operations is the management of the allocation of a
   finite set of reusable resources among a set of concurrently executing
   processes so that this allocation remains dead-lock-free. The
   corresponding problem is known as deadlock avoidance, and its resolution
   in a way that retains the sought operational flexibilities has been a
   challenging problem due to: (i) the inability to easily foresee the
   longer-term implications of an imminent allocation and (ii) the very
   large sizes of the relevant state spaces that prevent an online
   assessment of these implications through exhaustive enumeration. A
   recent methodology has sought to address these complications through the
   offline identification and storage of a set of critical states in the
   underlying state space that renders efficient the safety assessment of
   any given resource allocation. The results presented in this paper
   further extend and strengthen this methodology by complementing it with
   techniques borrowed from the area of symbolic computation; these
   techniques enable a more compressed representation of the underlying
   state spaces and of the various subsets and operations that are involved
   in the pursued computation.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon interposers with through-silicon vias (TSVs) have been developed
   in single-crystalline silicon wafer to address the high I/O density
   requirements between high performance logic, memory, graphic, and other
   devices. However, single-crystalline silicon interposers suffer from
   many shortcomings such as high cost, low electrical performance, and
   reliability. To overcome these shortcomings of traditional silicon
   interposers, an entirely different approach using polycrystalline
   silicon panels with polymer liners and through-package-vias (TPVs) is
   proposed by Georgia Tech Packaging Research Center. This paper, for the
   first time, focuses on the reliability of TPVs in polycrystalline
   silicon interposers fabricated from panels. Mechanical simulations were
   carried out that show lower stresses in TPVs in polycrystalline silicon
   lined with thick polymer liners, compared with TSVs in traditional
   single-crystalline silicon with thin SiO2 layers. TPVs were fabricated
   for thermal cycling tests, resistance monitoring, and scanning electron
   microscope imaging. The reliability characterization results showed good
   mechanical reliability of TPVs in polycrystalline silicon panels.}},

Abstract = {{The requirement of ultralow power and energy efficient systems is
   becoming more and more important with the increase in the use of
   miniaturized portable devices and unsupervised remote sensor systems.
   3-D integration is an emerging technology that helps in reducing
   footprint as well as power. In this paper, we study in detail the
   combined benefits of 3-D ICs and low-voltage supply designs to obtain
   maximum energy efficiency. We implement different types of circuits in
   conventional 2-D and through-silicon-via-based 3-D designs at different
   supply voltages varying from nominal to subthreshold voltages. The
   impact of 3-D integration on these different types of circuits is
   analyzed. Our study is based on power and energy comparison of full
   GDSII layouts. Our study confirms that subthreshold/near-threshold
   circuits indeed offer a few orders of magnitude power versus performance
   tradeoff with further improvement due to 3-D implementation. In
   addition, 3-D designs reduce the footprint area up to 78\% and
   wirelength up to 33\% compared with the 2-D counterpart for individual
   design benchmarks. Our studies also show that thermal and IR drop issues
   are negligible in subthreshold 3-D implementation due to its extreme
   low-power operation. Finally, we demonstrate the low-power and
   high-memory bandwidth advantages of many-core 3-D subthreshold circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The mission of the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) is to provide medical
   and healthcare delivery for the U.S. Army. Given the large number of
   medical specialties in the AMEDD, determining the appropriate number of
   hires and promotions for each medical specialty is a complex task. The
   AMEDD Personnel Proponency Directorate (APPD) previously used a manual
   approach to project the number of hires, promotions, and personnel
   inventory for each medical specialty across the AMEDD to support a
   30-year life cycle. As a means of decision support to APPD, we proffer
   the objective force model (OFM) to optimize AMEDD workforce planning. We
   also employ a discrete-event simulation model to verify and validate the
   results.
   In this paper, we describe the OFM applied to the Medical Specialist
   Corps, one of the six officer corps in the AMEDD. The OFM permits better
   transparency of personnel for senior AMEDD decision makers, whereas
   effectively projecting the optimal number of officers to meet the
   demands of the current workforce structure. The OFM provides tremendous
   value to APPD in terms of time, requiring only seconds to solve rather
   than months; this enables APPD to conduct quick what-if analyses for
   decision support, which was impossible to do manually.}},

   based on a generic tree architecture is introduced to achieve multilevel

   many different deposition sequences without modifying the underlying
   software. The tree can be easily traversed using recursive techniques,
   simplifying the programmer's task and opening up novel material
   combinations and sequences to thin film researchers. A LABVIEW software
   implementation consisting of a few simple functions is presented, as

Title = {{Palladium-platinum core-shell icosahedra with substantially enhanced
   activity and durability towards oxygen reduction}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Conformal deposition of platinum as ultrathin shells on facet-controlled
   palladium nanocrystals offers a great opportunity to enhance the
   catalytic performance while reducing its loading. Here we report such a
   system based on palladium icosahedra. Owing to lateral confinement
   imposed by twin boundaries and thus vertical relaxation only, the
   platinum overlayers evolve into a corrugated structure under compressive
   strain. For the core-shell nanocrystals with an average of 2.7 platinum
   overlayers, their specific and platinum mass activities towards oxygen
   reduction are enhanced by eight- and sevenfold, respectively, relative
   to a commercial catalyst. Density functional theory calculations
   indicate that the enhancement can be attributed to the weakened binding
   of hydroxyl to the compressed platinum surface supported on palladium.
   After 10,000 testing cycles, the mass activity of the core-shell
   nanocrystals is still four times higher than the commercial catalyst.
   These results demonstrate an effective approach to the development of
   electrocatalysts with greatly enhanced activity and durability.}},

Abstract = {{In coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission systems, coordinated base
   stations (BSs) are geographically separated and have their own
   oscillators, thereby causing multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs)
   at the receiver. Therefore, perfect synchronization cannot be obtained
   at the mobile station (MS), resulting in severe interference. To resolve
   this problem, this study proposes a novel transceiver structure with
   improved robustness toward interference. With the knowledge of CFO and
   channel frequency response, a closed-form solution is derived for the
   suboptimal CFO compensation value to minimize the approximated upper
   bound of the inter-carrier interference (ICI) plus noise power for
   environments with large-scale fading. The results reveal that the
   sub-optimal CFO compensation value is a function of both the degree of
   large-scale fading and the value of CFOs. Simulation results demonstrate
   that the proposedmethod significantly outperforms the existing
   structures and exhibits improved performance in terms of bit error rate.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) introduce a new communication paradigm
   that enables unlicensed users to opportunistically access spectrum bands
   assigned to licensed users. Interestingly, the broadcast problem, which
   is one of the most fundamental operations in CRNs, has not been well
   studied. Existing works for the broadcast issue in CRNs are heuristic
   solutions either without a performance guarantee or with performance far
   from the optimal solution. In this paper, we study the minimum-latency
   broadcast scheduling (MLBS) issue for CRNs. Our contributions are
   threefold. First, we propose a mixed broadcast scheduling (MBS)
   algorithm under the unit disk graph (UDG) model, denoted by MBS-UDG.
   MBS-UDG finishes a broadcast task by employing mixed unicast and
   broadcast communication modes in two phases. We show that the latency
   performance of MBS-UDG is O(h + Delta(T)) when Delta(T) <= 1/p or O(h +
   log(1-p)(1/p Delta(T))) when Delta(T) > 1/p, where h and Delta(T) are
   the height and the maximum number of leaf nodes connected by a second
   user (SU) of the broadcasting tree, respectively, and p is the spectrum
   opportunity for a secondary communication. Furthermore, the redundancy
   performance of MBS-UDG is analyzed. Second, we extend MBS-UDG to a more
   general MBS algorithm under the protocol interference model and analyze
   its latency and redundancy performance. Finally, simulations are
   conducted to validate MBS, which indicate that MBS significantly
   improves existing algorithms with respect to both latency and
   redundancy.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a high performance micro gas chromatograph
   column with a novel two dimensional axial heating technique for faster
   and more precise temperature programming, resulting in an improved

   were simulated theoretically on a 3.0 m x 300 mu m x 50 mu m column for
   the highest temperature gradient on a 22 by 22 mu m column. The best
   design was then micro-fabricated and evaluated experimentally. The
   simulation results showed that simultaneous temperature gradients in
   time and distance along the column are possible by geometric
   optimization of the heater when using forced convection. The gradients
   along the column continuously refocused eluting bands, offsetting part
   of the chromatographic band spreading. The utility of this method was
   further investigated for a test mixture of three hydrocarbons (hexane,
   octane, and decane).}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates single-pass fabrication of thick, crack-free
   deposits of Rene 80, a high gamma-prime ``non-weldable{''} superalloy,
   atop like-chemistry substrates through scanning laser epitaxy (SLE), a
   metal powder bed-based laser additive manufacturing (AM) technique.
   Microstructural investigations and processing zone identification are
   presented. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy reveal
   the segregated dendritic microstructure with the presence of finer
   carbides and primary gamma' particles. Transmission electron microscopy
   reveals a bimodal distribution of finer secondary gamma' particles in
   the deposit region. Microindentation hardness measurements show an
   increase in the hardness value by 25\% in the deposit region compared to
   the cast substrate due to microstructural refinement. In addition to the
   achievement of metallurgical continuity across the interface and
   improved hardness in the deposit, the crack-free deposits obtained here
   for Rene 80 represent one of the few successes reported for a
   non-weldable alloy of its kind. The results presented here illustrate
   the significant potential of SLE for the AM-based repair of existing and
   AM-based construction of entirely new gas turbine hot-section components
   utilizing powders of high gamma' nickel-based superalloys that have long
   been known to have high tendency for cracking under the processing
   conditions associated with traditional welding, joining, and cladding
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is increasingly becoming commonplace to
   deposit high density, conformal films, as novel deposition techniques
   allow improved deposition rates on various substrates. Diffusion and
   miscibility of ALD precursors with polymers are known to affect film
   nucleation. To assess the influence of polymeric underlayer on the
   growth and mechanical behavior of ALD films, we deposited aluminum oxide
   (Al2O3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) films on three different polymers
   with known reactivity to the ALD precursors and compared them to films
   on polyethylene terephthalate (PET). We present the trends in nucleation
   and penetration of the ALD films on the various polymers as well as the
   in situ mechanical behavior under tensile strain. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that Cytop, a fluorinated polymer and
   polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) delay the nucleation of Al2O3 and
   TiO2 films. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFSIMS) shows the extent
   of diffusion of the ALD precursors into the polymer underlayer, delaying
   nucleation. Tensile tests show that while the crack onset strain
   remained unchanged despite the various polymer underlayers, the crack
   saturation density decreased for ALD films on PEIE and
   polyhydroxystyrene (PHOST). Films on Cytop showed no crack saturation
   limit until the nucleation delay was overcome indicating that judicious
   choice of the ALD film and polymer underlayer will allow tailoring of
   the length of the diffusion zone and crack saturation, but not the crack
   onset strain, which will be addressed in future studies.}},

Title = {{Taking advantage of rotifer sensitivity to rotenone to prevent pond

Abstract = {{Although algae-biofuels have many advantages including high areal
   productivity, algae can be preyed upon by amoeba, ciliates, and
   rotifers, particularly in open pond systems. Thus, these algal predators
   need to be controlled. In this study, Chlorella kessleri was used as the
   algae and the freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as the
   predator. The effect of the pesticide, rotenone, was tested with the
   goal of totally inhibiting the rotifer while causing only minor
   inhibition to the alga. The rotenone 24-hr LC50 for B. calyciflorus was
   0.074 mu M while C. kessleri growth was uninhibited at 0.8 mu M. The
   rotenone EC50 for population growth of the marine alga Tetraselmis
   suecica was 0.56 mu M, in contrast to 0.13 and 0.26 mu M for the marine
   rotifers Brachionus rotundiformis and Brachionus manjavacas,
   respectively. Rotifer reproduction was inhibited at even lower rotenone
   concentrations than those causing mortality. In co-culture, a rotenone
   concentration of 0.1 mu M caused near complete B. calyciflorus mortality
   while leaving C. kessleri growth unaffected. Rotenone applications to
   produce 1 million gallons of biodiesel in one year are estimated to cost
   \$842. This provides algae farmers an important and inexpensive tool to
   manage grazing predators in algae mass cultures and avoid pond crashes.

Abstract = {{Toward the development of a constitutive model for describing high
   strain-rate behavior of cementitious materials, this study couples
   multiscale quantitative characterization of mortars with micromechanics
   modeling, validated against dynamic experiments. Blast or impact loads
   create a far-field compressive loading condition that drives local
   tensile crack growth from flaws. Two flaw types - round (e.g., entrained
   air voids) and slit (e.g., tandem effect of the interfacial transition
   zone and the aggregates) flaws - are considered in this flaw-driven,
   elastic model for predicting strength at high strain-rates. The model
   sheds light on the linkage between meso-scale fluctuations of the flaw
   populations (including size, shape, and spatial arrangement) and the
   material's overall dynamic response. Dynamic strength is interpreted in
   a statistical framework rather than a deterministic one. Micromechanics
   results agree with Kolslcy bar tests on mortars with and without air
   entrainment. The model may be useful for engineering concrete for
   potentially at-risk elements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A Comprehensive Study of Formic Acid Oxidation on Palladium Nanocrystals

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Palladium has been recognized as the best anodic, monometallic
   electrocatalyst for the formic acid oxidation (FAO) reaction in a direct
   formic acid fuel cell. Here we report a systematic study of FAO on a
   variety of Pd nanocrystals, including cubes, right bipyramids,
   octahedra, tetrahedra, decahedra, and icosahedra. These nanocrystals
   were synthesized with approximately the same size, but different types
   of facets and twin defects on their surfaces. Our measurements indicate
   that the Pd nanocrystals enclosed by \{100\} facets have higher specific
   activities than those enclosed by \{111\} facets, in agreement with
   prior observations for Pd single-crystal substrates. If comparing
   nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by a specific type of facet, \{100\}
   or \{111\}, those with twin defects displayed greatly enhanced FAO
   activities compared to their single-crystal counterparts. To rationalize
   these experimental results, we performed periodic, self-consistent DFT
   calculations on model single-crystal substrates of Pd, representing the
   active sites present in the nanocrystals used in the experiments. The
   calculation results suggest that the enhancement of FAO activity on
   defect regions, represented by Pd(211) sites, compared to the activity
   of both Pd(100) and Pd(111) surfaces, could be attributed to an
   increased flux through the HCOO-mediated pathway rather than the
   COOH-mediated pathway on Pd(211). Since COOH has been identified as a
   precursor to CO, a site-poisoning species, a lower coverage of CO at the
   defect regions will lead to a higher activity for the corresponding
   nanocrystal catalysts, containing those defect regions.}},

Abstract = {{Current dielectric nanopowder research in wide bandgap insulators has
   revealed an order of magnitude increase in dielectric permittivities
   over bulk values {[}1]-{[}3]. Researchers in this area postulate that
   interfacial layers at material boundaries have enhanced polarizability
   because of local relaxation mechanisms, such as rotational dipoles or
   localized space charge polarization {[}1], {[}3]. Equivalent macroscopic
   electromagnetic models that have low-k grain/particle cores with average
   diameters ranging from 5 to 40 nm and high-k thin encapsulating layers
   with thicknesses from 0.8 to 1.0 nm are simulated in this paper using
   finite-element method and control-volume approach. The purpose of this
   investigation is to explore the impact of the microstructure on the
   overall electrical properties of these types of materials. To help
   validate this simulation approach, laminate geometries of silicon
   dioxide and silicon nitride are fabricated and tested by the authors.
   From these test samples, an effective permittivity model of interfacial
   layers for simple laminate geometries is extracted and is used to
   predict the macroscopic behavior of more complicated nanocomposites.
   Furthermore, the impact of the conductivity of low-k cores is also
   explored with the assumption that the high-k interfacial boundaries
   remain perfectly insulating. For low-conductivity cores, it is shown
   that the real part of the permittivity decreases with increasing
   particulate/grain size that is generally consistent with nanopowder
   research in {[}3]. However, at higher core conductivities, this
   dependence completely changes such that the real permittivity increases
   with increasing particulate/grain size. This change in dependence is due
   to charges accumulating at core boundaries producing a Maxwell-Wagner
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) enable many applications
   such as underground pipeline monitoring, power grid maintenance, mine
   disaster prevention, and oil upstream monitoring among many others.
   While the classical electromagnetic waves do not work well in WUSNs, the
   magnetic induction (MI) propagation technique provides constant channel
   conditions via small size of antenna coils in the underground
   environments. In this paper, instead of adopting currently layered
   protocols approach, a distributed cross-layer protocol design is
   proposed for MI-based WUSNs. First, a detailed overview is given for
   different communication functionalities from physical to network layers
   as well as the QoS requirements of applications. Utilizing the
   interactions of different layer functionalities, a distributed
   environment-aware protocol, called DEAP, is then developed to satisfy
   statistical QoS guarantees and achieve both optimal energy savings and
   throughput gain concurrently. Simulations confirm that the proposed
   cross-layer protocol achieves significant energy savings, high
   throughput efficiency and dependable MI communication for WUSNs.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) results
   have indicated that network mapping can contribute to understanding
   behavior and disease, but it has been difficult to translate the maps
   created with rsfMRI to neuroelectrical states in the brain. Recently,
   dynamic analyses have revealed multiple patterns in the rsfMRI signal
   that are strongly associated with particular bands of neural activity.
   To further investigate these findings, simultaneously recorded invasive
   electrophysiology and rsfMRI from rats were used to examine two types of
   electrical activity (directly measured low-frequency/infraslow activity
   and band-limited power of higher frequencies) and two types of dynamic
   rsfMRI (quasi-periodic patterns or QPP, and sliding window correlation
   or SWC). The relationship between neural activity and dynamic rsfMRI was
   tested under three anesthetic states in rats: dexmedetomidine and high
   and low doses of isoflurane. Under dexmedetomidine, the lightest
   anesthetic, infraslow electrophysiology correlated with QPP but not SWC,
   whereas band-limited power in higher frequencies correlated with SWC but
   not QPP. Results were similar under isoflurane; however, the QPP was
   also correlated to band-limited power, possibly due to the
   burst-suppression state induced by the anesthetic agent. The results
   provide additional support for the hypothesis that the two types of
   dynamic rsfMRI are linked to different frequencies of neural activity,
   but isoflurane anesthesia may make this relationship more complicated.
   Understanding which neural frequency bands appear as particular dynamic
   patterns in rsfMRI may ultimately help isolate components of the rsfMRI
   signal that are of interest to disorders such as schizophrenia and
   attention deficit disorder.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the piezotronic effect is investigated for the first time
   in external electric fields ranging from 0 V.cm(-1) to 2,000 V.cm(-1) by
   using n-type ZnO nanowires supported by a flexible substrate. In the
   presence of an external electric field, the Schottky barrier height
   (SBH) is lowered by the image force, allowing more free carriers to pass
   through the metal-semiconductor junction and enhancing the screening
   effect on positive piezoelectric polarization charges. As the strength
   of the external electric field increases, the piezotronic effect is
   significantly suppressed and the metal-semiconductor contact finally
   exhibits Ohmic behavior. The experimental results show that devices can
   be classified into three groups, corresponding to low, moderate, and
   high carrier densities of the nanowires used. This work not only helps
   us to explicate the basic physical mechanism of the piezotronic effect
   in a harsh environment in an electric field but also provides guidelines
   for future design and fabrication of piezotronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dose UV irradiation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-insulating
   polymer (polystyrene (PS) or polyisobutylene (PIB)) blend solutions led
   to the formation of highly ordered P3HT nanofibrillar structures in
   solidified thin films. The P3HT nanofibers were effectively
   interconnected through P3HT islands phase-separated from insulating
   polymer regions in blend films comprising a relatively low fraction of
   P3HT. Films prepared with a P3HT content as low as 5 wt \% exhibited
   excellent macroscopic charge transport characteristics. The impact of PS
   on P3HT intramolecular and intermolecular interactions was
   systematically investigated. The presence of PS chains appeared to
   assist in the UV irradiation process of the blend solutions to
   facilitate molecular interactions of the semiconductor component, and to
   enhance P3HT chain interactions during spin coating because of
   relatively unfavorable P3HT-PS chain interactions. However, P3HT
   lamellar packing was hindered in the presence of PS chains, because of
   favorable hydrophobic interactions between the P3HT hexyl substituents
   and the PS chains. As a result, the lamellar packing d-spacing
   increased, and the coherence length corresponding to the lamellar
   packing decreased, as the amount of PS in the blend films increased.}},

Abstract = {{T cells recognize antigens at the two-dimensional (2D) interface with
   antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which trigger T-cell effector
   functions. T-cell functional outcomes correlate with 2D kinetics of
   membrane-embedded T-cell receptors (TCRs) binding to surface-tethered
   peptide-major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCs). However,
   most studies have measured TCR-pMHC kinetics for recombinant TCRs in 3D
   by surface plasmon resonance, which differs drastically from 2D
   measurements. Here, we compared pMHC dissociation from native TCR on the
   T-cell surface to recombinant TCR immobilized on glass surface or in
   solution. Force on TCR-pMHC bonds regulated their lifetimes differently
   for native than recombinant TCRs. Perturbing the cellular environment
   suppressed 2D on-rates but had no effect on 2D off-rate regardless of
   whether force was applied. In contrast, for the TCR interacting with its
   monoclonal antibody, the 2D on-rate was insensitive to cellular
   perturbations and the force-dependent off-rates were indistinguishable
   for native and recombinant TCRs. These data present novel features of
   TCR-pMHC kinetics that are regulated by the cellular environment,
   underscoring the limitations of 3D kinetics in predicting T-cell
   functions and calling for further elucidation of the underlying
   molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate 2D kinetics in
   physiological settings.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Impairments in mitochondria, oxidative regulation, and calcium
   homeostasis have been well documented in numerous Amyotrophic Lateral
   Sclerosis (ALS) experimental models, especially in the superoxide
   dismutase 1 glycine 93 to alanine (SOD1 G93A) transgenic mouse. However,
   the timing of these deficiencies has been debatable. In a systematic
   review of 45 articles, we examine experimental measurements of cellular
   respiration, mitochondrial mechanisms, oxidative markers, and calcium
   regulation. We evaluate the quantitative magnitude and statistical
   temporal trend of these aggregated assessments in high transgene copy
   SOD1 G93A mice compared to wild type mice. Analysis of overall trends
   reveals cellular respiration, intracellular adenosine triphosphate, and
   corresponding mitochondrial elements (Cox, cytochrome c, complex I,
   enzyme activity) are depressed for the entire lifespan of the SOD1 G93A
   mouse. Oxidant markers (H2O2, 8OH2'dG, MDA) are initially similar to
   wild type but are double that of wild type by the time of symptom onset
   despite early post-natal elevation of protective heat shock proteins.
   All aspects of calcium regulation show early disturbances, although a
   notable and likely compensatory convergence to near wild type levels
   appears to occur between 40 and 80 days (pre-onset), followed by a
   post-onset elevation in intracellular calcium. The identified temporal
   trends and compensatory fluctuations provide evidence that the
   ``cause{''} of ALS may lay within failed homeostatic regulation, itself,
   rather than any one particular perturbing event or cellular mechanism.
   We discuss the vulnerabilities of motoneurons to regulatory instability
   and possible hypotheses regarding failed regulation and its potential
   treatment in ALS.}},

   obstruction. For RNLoS, different surfaces are used as reflectors. From
   the large set of LoS and OLoS measured data, the parameters for
   single-slope path loss model with shadowing are devised. Furthermore,
   the analysis of multipath propagation is performed. The results show
   that strong multiple reflections from the transmitter and receiver
   electronics are present both in LoS and OLoS environments. Additionally,
   the results show that glass and ceramic objects in the propagation path
   produce surface-diffracted rays which clock-wise and counter clock-wise
   superposition leads to frequency-dependent path loss. Finally, the
   results show that the RNLoS measured path loss with aluminum plate as a
   reflector is very similar to free-space path loss when the angle of
   incidence and the angle of reflection are equal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a newly developed apparatus, Iron Rat, for
   locomotion research in rodents. Its main purpose is to allow maximal
   freedom of voluntary overground movement of the animal while providing
   forceful interaction to the hindlimbs. Advantages and challenges of the
   proposed exoskeletal apparatus over other existing designs are
   discussed. Design and implementation challenges are presented and
   discussed, emphasizing their implications for free, voluntary movement
   of the animal. A live-animal experiment was conducted to assess the
   design. Unconstrained natural movement of the animal was compared with
   its movement with the exoskeletal module attached. The compact design
   and back-drivable implementation of this apparatus will allow novel
   experimental manipulations that may include forceful yet compliant
   dynamic interaction with the animal's overground locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{Although miniaturised fuel cells store more energy than lithium-ion
   batteries and super capacitors, they source less power, which means they
   cannot power as many functions. Their power-dense counterparts, however,
   cannot sustain life for long, which is why mixing technologies is
   appealing. Still, microsystems are tiny and react quickly, so their
   supply circuits must also be small and fast. For this reason, the
   dual-source hysteretic single-inductor 0.18 mu m complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor charger-supply system presented and discussed
   here draws constant power from an energy-dense source and supplementary
   power from a rechargeable power-dense battery. The prototyped system
   supplies and responds to 1-4 mA load dumps within one or two clock
   cycles with 73\% peak efficiency and recharges the battery with excess
   power from the energy-dense source. When managed to draw supplementary
   power from a battery this way and loaded with a microsystem that idles
   at 10 mu W and peaks to 4 mW, as in the case of typical wireless
   sensors, the combined weight of the sources required is 68\% less than
   those of the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{Copepods escape well by detecting minute gradients in the flow field;
   they react quickly, and swim away strongly. As a key link in the aquatic
   food web, these small planktonic organisms often encounter
   suction-feeding fish. Studies have identified certain hydrodynamic
   features that are created by the approach of this visual predator and
   the generation of its suction flow for capturing food. Similarly,
   studies have identified certain hydrodynamic features that evoke the
   evasive response of copepods. This is a review of the copepod sensory
   motor system as pertains to understanding their response to
   suction-feeding fish. Analyses of the reaction time, threshold
   sensitivity, structure of sensors, and evasive behavior by this key prey
   of fish can be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of feeding
   tactics in response to suction flow. To illustrate, we present results
   comparing a copepod from a fishless lake (Hesperodiaptomus shoshone) to
   a copepod from a rich fishing ground (Calanus finmarchicus). We designed
   a flow mimic that produces a realistic mushroom-cap-shaped flow field
   and realistic accelerations of flow; the copepods treated the mimic as a
   threat and performed jumps directed up and away from the siphon. Calanus
   finmarchicus responded at an average threshold strain rate of 18.7/s,
   escaped at 0.46 m/s, and traveled 5.99 mm, most frequently as a single
   jump. Hesperodiaptomus shoshone responded at a strain rate of 15.1/s
   that is not significantly different, escaped more slowly at 0.22 m/s and
   traveled a shorter distance of 3.01 mm using a series of hops. The high
   variability noted in the initial angle of the body and the maximum
   change in body angle suggests that unpredictability in the escape
   maneuver is another aspect of the tactic of copepods. The speed of the
   escape by small copepods 2-3 mm long is overwhelmed by the speed of the
   attack by the much larger, faster fish; if the copepod reacts when it is
   within the fish's arena of capture (< 1.5 mm from mouth), it will be
   eaten. The copepod, however, has an acutely sensitive array of
   mechanosensors that perceive the flow field of the fish at distances of
   3-6 mm, or outside the fish's range of capture. The copepod also has a
   rapid and strong locomotory response, thereby increasing the odds that
   the copepod will survive-but speed is unlikely to be the best tactic for
   staying alive. Instead, the copepod accelerates from 61.3 to 96.5 m/s(2)
   or more than 20 times stronger than the lunge of a fish. This collection
   of capabilities of copepods enables them to remain one of the most
   abundant multicellular organisms on our planet.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a synthesis of the investigations at the atomic
   scale of the transport properties of defects and fission gases in
   uranium dioxide, as well as of the transfer of results from the atomic
   scale to models at the mesoscopic scale, performed during the F-BRIDGE
   European project (2008-2012).
   We first present the mesoscale models used to investigate uranium oxide
   fuel under irradiation, and in particular the cluster dynamics and
   kinetic Monte Carlo methods employed to model the behaviour of defects
   and fission gases in UO2, as well as the parameters of these models.
   Second, we describe briefly the atomic scale methods employed, i.e.
   electronic structure calculations and empirical potential methods. Then,
   we show the results of the calculation of the data necessary for the
   mesoscale models using these atomic scale methods. Finally, we summarise
   the links built between the atomic and mesoscopic scale by listing the
   data calculated at the atomic scale which are to be used as input in
   mesoscale modelling.
   Despite specific difficulties in the description of fuel materials, the
   results obtained in F-BRIDGE show that atomic scale modelling methods
   are now mature enough to obtain precise data to feed higher scale models
   and help interpret experiments on nuclear fuels. These methods bring
   valuable insight, in particular the formation, binding and migration
   energies of point and extended defects, fission product localization,
   incorporation energies and migration pathways, elementary mechanisms of
   irradiation induced processes. These studies open the way for the
   investigation of other significant phenomena involved in fuel behaviour,
   in particular the thermochemical and thermomechanical properties and
   their evolution in-pile, complex microstructures, as well as of more
   complex fuels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This Perspective provides a contemporary understanding of the shape
   evolution of colloidal metal nanocrystals under thermodynamically and
   kinetically controlled conditions. It has been extremely challenging to
   investigate this subject in the setting of one-pot synthesis because
   both the type and number of seeds involved would be changed whenever the
   experimental conditions are altered, making it essentially impossible to
   draw conclusions when comparing the outcomes of two syntheses conducted
   under different conditions. Because of the uncertainty about seeds, most
   of the mechanistic insights reported in literature for one-pot syntheses
   of metal nanocrystals with different shapes are either incomplete or
   ambiguous, and some of them might be misleading or even wrong. Recently,
   with the use of well-defined seeds for such syntheses, it became
   possible to separate growth from nucleation and therefore investigate
   the explicit role(s) played by a specific thermodynamic or kinetic
   parameter in directing the evolution of colloidal metal nanocrystals
   into a specific shape. Starting from single-crystal seeds enclosed by a
   mix of \{100\}, \{111\}, and \{110\} facets, for example, one can obtain
   colloidal nanocrystals with diversified shapes by adjusting various
   thermodynamic or kinetic parameters. The mechanistic insights learnt
   from these studies can also be extended to account for the products of
   conventional one-pot syntheses that involve self-nucleation only. The
   knowledge can be further applied to many other types of seeds with twin
   defects or stacking faults, making it an exciting time to design and
   synthesize colloidal metal nanocrystals with the shapes sought for a
   variety of fundamental studies and technologically important
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate endothelial cell gene expression are
   now emerging. DNA methylation is the most stable epigenetic mark that
   confers persisting changes in gene expression. Not only is DNA
   methylation important in rendering cell identity by regulating cell
   type-specific gene expression throughout differentiation, but it is
   becoming clear that DNA methylation also plays a key role in maintaining
   endothelial cell homeostasis and in vascular disease development.
   Disturbed blood flow causes atherosclerosis, whereas stable flow
   protects against it by differentially regulating gene expression in
   endothelial cells. Recently, we and others have shown that
   flow-dependent gene expression and atherosclerosis development are
   regulated by mechanisms dependent on DNA methyltransferases (1 and 3A).
   Disturbed blood flow upregulates DNA methyltransferase expression both
   in vitro and in vivo, which leads to genome-wide DNA methylation
   alterations and global gene expression changes in a DNA
   methyltransferase-dependent manner. These studies revealed several
   mechanosensitive genes, such as HoxA5, Klf3, and Klf4, whose promoters
   were hypermethylated by disturbed blood flow, but rescued by DNA
   methyltransferases inhibitors such as 5Aza-2-deoxycytidine. These
   findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which flow controls
   epigenomic DNA methylation patterns, which in turn alters endothelial
   gene expression, regulates vascular biology, and modulates
   atherosclerosis development.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveFor a pregnant woman considering prenatal screening for early
   detection of Down Syndrome (DS), there are at least two major outcomes
   of interest: undetected DS live births and euploid procedure-related
   fetal losses. The risk-cutoff value of 1/270 has been commonly used for
   recommending a diagnostic test. The objective of this study was to
   assess the impact of women's preferences for different pregnancy
   outcomes on the optimal risk-cutoff values for integrated screening.
   MethodWe built a Monte Carlo simulation model of 100000 singleton
   second-trimester pregnancies to assess the probabilities of DS live
   births and euploid procedure-related fetal losses for various
   risk-cutoff values. To capture how undesirable some women may view an
   undetected DS live birth relative to a euploid procedure-related fetal
   loss, we used a ratio W-1:W-2 of weights (penalties) assigned to these
   two adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   ResultsAs the relative weight changes, the optimal risk-cutoff value
   changes significantly.
   ConclusionA one-size-fits-all risk-cutoff value, such as 1/270, may not
   always be the best choice, depending on the preferences of women.
   Preference-sensitive risk-cutoff values for DS screening have the
   potential to improve the pregnancy outcomes and patient satisfaction.

Abstract = {{Rare cell identification is an interesting and challenging question in
   flow cytometry data analysis. In the literature, manual gating is a
   popular approach to distill flow cytometry data and drill down to the
   rare cells of interest, based on prior knowledge of measured protein
   markers and visual inspection of the data. Several computational
   algorithms have been proposed for rare cell identification. To compare
   existing algorithms and promote new developments, FlowCAP-III put
   forward one computational challenge that focused on this question. The
   challenge provided flow cytometry data for 202 training samples and two
   manually gated rare cell types for each training sample, roughly 0.02
   and 0.04\% of the cells, respectively. In addition, flow cytometry data
   for 203 testing samples were provided, and participants were invited to
   computationally identify the rare cells in the testing samples. Accuracy
   of the identification results was evaluated by comparing to manual
   gating of the testing samples. We participated in the challenge, and
   developed a method that combined the Hellinger divergence, a
   downsampling trick and the ensemble SVM. Our method achieved the highest
   accuracy in the challenge. (c) 2015 International Society for

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been used in a wide variety of biological
   studies; however, the large size of CRISPR/Cas9 presents challenges in
   packaging it within adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) for clinical
   applications. We identified a two-cassette system expressing pieces of
   the S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) protein which splice together in cellula
   to form a functional protein capable of site-specific DNA cleavage. With
   specific CRISPR guide strands, we demonstrated the efficacy of this
   system in cleaving the HBB and CCR5 genes in human HEK-293T cells as a
   single Cas9 and as a pair of Cas9 nickases. The trans-spliced SpCas9
   (tsSpCas9) displayed similar to 35\% of the nuclease activity compared
   with the wild-type SpCas9 (wtSpCas9) at standard transfection doses, but
   had substantially decreased activity at lower dosing levels. The greatly
   reduced open reading frame length of the tsSpCas9 relative to wtSpCas9
   potentially allows for more complex and longer genetic elements to be
   packaged into an AAV vector including tissue-specific promoters,
   multiplexed guide RNA expression, and effector domain fusions to SpCas9.
   For unknown reasons, the tsSpCas9 system did not work in all cell types
   tested. The use of protein trans-splicing may help facilitate exciting
   new avenues of research and therapeutic applications through AAV-based
   delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 systems.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, fine particulate matter (PM) pollution and visibility
   degradation have become severe air quality issues in China. In this
   study, PM2.5 pollution over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region during
   January, April, August, and November 2009 was simulated using the
   Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. An in-depth diagnostic
   analysis, focused on November 2009, was also conducted to reveal the
   patterns of sulfate and nitrate distribution, and to identify the main
   factors that influence the formation of sulfate and nitrate under
   typical meteorological conditions. The CMAQ model reasonably reproduced
   the observed concentrations, but showed better performance for January
   and November than it did for April and August, for which there was
   light-moderate underestimation of SO2, NOx, O-3, PM10, and PM2.5
   concentrations, and slight overestimation of daily 8-h maximum
   concentrations of O-3. Utilizing a sulfate tracking technique, it was
   found that on nearly 20 days in November 2009, characterized by
   northeasterly winds, cross-boundary transport contributed to >75\% of
   the total sulfate budget, while local gas phase oxidation and primary
   emissions averaged 10\% and 8\%, respectively. Aqueous sulfate typically
   contributed less than 1\% of the total sulfate budget, except when the
   winds were directed from the sea and high humidity favored aqueous
   oxidation, and the percentage contribution reached up to 46\%. NH3 was
   generally sufficient to fully neutralize H2SO4; however, the formation
   of nitrate over the PRD was limited by the availability of NH3. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in understanding the fate of the Amazon
   over the coming century in the face of climate change, rising
   atmospheric CO2 levels, ongoing land transformation, and changing fire
   regimes within the region. In this analysis, we explore the fate of
   Amazonian ecosystems under the combined impact of these four
   environmental forcings using three terrestrial biosphere models (ED2,
   IBIS, and JULES) forced by three bias-corrected IPCC AR4 climate
   projections (PCM1, CCSM3, and HadCM3) under two land-use change
   scenarios. We assess the relative roles of climate change, CO2
   fertilization, land-use change, and fire in driving the projected
   changes in Amazonian biomass and forest extent. Our results indicate
   that the impacts of climate change are primarily determined by the
   direction and severity of projected changes in regional precipitation:
   under the driest climate projection, climate change alone is predicted
   to reduce Amazonian forest cover by an average of 14\%. However, the
   models predict that CO2 fertilization will enhance vegetation
   productivity and alleviate climate-induced increases in plant water
   stress, and, as a result, sustain high biomass forests, even under the
   driest climate scenario. Land-use change and climate-driven changes in
   fire frequency are predicted to cause additional aboveground biomass
   loss and reductions in forest extent. The relative impact of land use
   and fire dynamics compared to climate and CO2 impacts varies
   considerably, depending on both the climate and land-use scenario, and
   on the terrestrial biosphere model used, highlighting the importance of
   improved quantitative understanding of all four factors - climate
   change, CO2 fertilization effects, fire, and land use - to the fate of
   the Amazon over the coming century.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody-mediated Drug Delivery Systems (ADDS) are emerging as one of
   the most encouraging therapeutic solutions for treating several diseases
   such as human cancers. ADDS use small molecules (antibodies) that
   propagate in the body and bind selectively to their corresponding
   receptors (antigens) expressed at the surface of the diseased cells. In
   this paper, the Molecular Communication (MC) paradigm, where information
   is conveyed through the concentration of molecules, is advocated for the
   engineering of ADDS and modeling their complex behavior, to provide a
   realistic model without the over-complication of system biology models,
   and the limitations of experimental approaches. The peculiarities of
   antibodies, including their anisotropic transport and complex
   electrochemical structure, are taken into account to develop an
   analytical model of the ADDS transport and antigen-binding kinetics. The
   end-to-end response of ADDS, from the drug injection to the drug
   absorption, is mathematically derived based on the geometry of the
   antibody molecule, the electrochemical structure of the antibody-antigen
   complex, and the physiology of the patient. The accuracy of the MC model
   is validated by finite-element (COMSOL) simulations. The implications of
   the complex interplay between the transport and kinetics parameters on
   the performance of ADDS are effectively captured by the proposed MC
   model. The MC model of ADDS will enable the discovery and optimization
   of drugs in a versatile, cost-efficient, and reliable manner.}},

   coupled with hardware-induced error distribution of a digital CNN cell

   modulate the cell dynamics and propagate through the network degrading
   the output quality and increasing the convergence time. The error
   propagation is determined by the task being performed by the CNN,

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the impact of the interconnect variation at the
   system level in terms of clock frequency based on a fast and efficient
   system-level variation-aware design methodology. Various types of
   interconnect variations are compared, such as the critical dimension for
   line/core and spacer, etch, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), and
   overlay variations. The 3 sigma values for these independent variation
   values are extracted from various fabrication processes, including the
   litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) double patterning, self-aligned double
   patterning (SADP), and self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP). The
   results indicate that the impact of the interconnect variation on the
   clock frequency increases for a processor at a smaller technology node,
   especially for the CMP variation. For the impact of the combination of
   five sources of interconnect variations, the processor using the SADP
   performs the best. The overlay variation and the spacer variation have a
   larger impact on the LELE double patterning and the SAQP patterning
   techniques. Up to 8\% and 16\% of the frequency drops are observed based
   on 1x and 2x of the default 3 sigma values, respectively.}},

   large electric fields are the driving force in mixed-mode hot-carrier
   degradation, the Auger recombination process is shown to be the
   hot-carrier source under high-current stress conditions. Auger
   hot-carrier degradation shows a positive temperature dependence, unlike
   mixed-mode degradation, due to the temperature dependence of Auger
   recombination and its energy distribution function. We also use
   calibrated TCAD simulations to explain an unexpected stress threshold
   behavior that occurs due to the formation of a potential well in the
   neutral base region, and to explore a field-compression effect at the
   collector/subcollector junction that contributes to trap formation at

Abstract = {{The exceptional benefits of wind power as an environmentally responsible
   renewable energy resource have led to an increasing penetration of wind
   energy in today's power systems. This trend has started to reshape the
   paradigms of power system operations, as dealing with uncertainty caused
   by the highly intermittent and uncertain wind power becomes a
   significant issue. Motivated by this, we present a new framework using
   adaptive robust optimization for the economic dispatch of power systems
   with high level of wind penetration. In particular, we propose an
   adaptive robust optimization model for multi-period economic dispatch,
   and introduce the concept of dynamic uncertainty sets and methods to
   construct such sets to model temporal and spatial correlations of
   uncertainty. We also develop a simulation platform which combines the
   proposed robust economic dispatch model with statistical prediction
   tools in a rolling horizon framework. We have conducted extensive
   computational experiments on this platform using real wind data. The
   results are promising and demonstrate the benefits of our approach in
   terms of cost and reliability over existing robust optimization models
   as well as recent look-ahead dispatch models.}},

   effectively clears contingencies with corrective actions that have a
   minimal impact on system operations. The proposed SCOPF model utilizes
   sparse optimization techniques to achieve computational tractability for

Abstract = {{The problem of imbalance detection in a three-phase power system using a
   phasor measurement unit (PMU) is considered. A general model for the
   zero, positive, and negative sequences from a PMU measurement at
   off-nominal frequencies is presented and a hypothesis testing framework
   is formulated. The new formulation takes into account the fact that
   minor degree of imbalance in the system is acceptable and does not
   indicate subsequent interruptions, failures, or degradation of physical
   components. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed and
   shown to be a function of the negative-sequence phasor estimator and the
   acceptable level of imbalances for nominal system operations. As a
   by-product to the proposed detection method, a constrained estimation of
   the positive and negative phasors and the frequency deviation is
   obtained for both balanced and unbalanced situations. The theoretical
   and numerical performance analyses show improved performance over
   benchmark techniques and robustness to the presence of additional
   harmonics.}},

   technological potential of these materials, such as enhanced
   thermoelectric energy conversion and improved thermal insulation, has
   fuelled the search for highly efficient phonon wave interference and

   developments in the understanding and manipulation of heat transport. We

   unprecedented opportunities for creating wave-like behaviour of heat,

   Results from mechanical tests showed that the existence of the barrier

Abstract = {{Using a natural experiment in research funding by the National
   Institutes of Health (NIH) following the American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, we study the NIH's revealed preference
   in project selection. We do so by comparing the characteristics of the
   projects additionally selected for funding due to an unexpected increase
   in resources under the ARRA with those supported through regular NIH
   budget. We find that the regular-funded projects are on average of
   higher quality, as measured by the number of publications per project
   and the impact of these publications, than ARRA-funded projects.
   Moreover, compared to ARRA projects, regular projects are more likely to
   produce highest-impact articles and exhibit greater variance in research
   output. The output from regular projects also seems more closely fitting
   the purpose of funding. The differences in project quality are largely
   explained by observable attributes of the projects and research teams,
   suggesting that the NIH may use these attributes as cues for discerning
   underlying project quality. In addition, ARRA projects are more likely
   than regular projects to involve investigators with past grant
   experience. Many of these inter-group differences are specific to RO1
   grants, the largest funding category in the NIH. Overall, these results
   suggest that the NIH's project selection appears generally in line with
   its purported mission. In particular, our results contrast starkly with
   the frequent criticism that the NIH is extremely risk-averse and
   unwarrantedly favors experienced investigators. We discuss the
   implications of our findings on the NIH's behavior in project selection.

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided wave imaging can potentially detect and localize
   damage over a large area with a sparse, or spatially distributed, array.
   However, conventional delay-and-sum imaging methods require knowledge of
   the propagation velocity and rely on direct-path propagation from the
   transmitting transducer, to a damage location, and finally to the
   receiving transducer, limiting the applicability of these techniques to
   relatively simple structures. A multipath guided wave imaging algorithm
   is presented here that leverages the large number of echoes and
   reverberations present in recorded ultrasonic waveforms to successfully
   detect and locate damage in geometrically complex structures. Multipath
   guided wave imaging not only allows imaging to be performed on
   structures with complex features (e.g. stiffeners, lap joints, and
   rivets) and inhomogeneous and anisotropic materials but also
   significantly improves image quality with far fewer sensors compared to
   conventional elliptical imaging. Experimental results from an aluminum
   plate and a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composite panel are provided
   to illustrate imaging efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have investigated the role of dependencies in the
   design process of mechatronic products. Since explicit modeling of
   dependencies is largely considered unnecessary today, current languages
   do not support dependency modeling due to lack of sufficiently
   expressive language constructs. However, this paper argues that modeling
   dependencies is important in managing the overall design process. The
   paper highlights dependencies between two important viewpoints: system
   design and mechanical design. We have looked closely at how mechanical
   design (supported by CAD tools) establishes a backbone for the overall
   design concept. Mechanical design cannot be isolated from other design
   activities, and the mismanagement of dependencies there leads to
   problems in other domains too. To illustrate the process, the paper
   presents an example of modeling dependencies between system hierarchy in
   OMG SysML (TM) and the CAD assembly in Solid Edge for a mechatronic
   design example. The paper presents two different approaches to capturing
   dependencies-using a general purpose modeling language such as SysML and
   using a domain specific modeling language (DSML). We argue for using a
   DSML instead of a general purpose language and provide a DSML called the
   dependency modeling language (DML). An example DML model for a two
   degree of freedom robot use case is discussed. The paper also
   illustrates the complete process of capturing dependencies in a general
   purpose modeling language like SysML, which served as a good exercise on
   how to fetch data from a CAD tool and how to represent dependencies
   inside a significantly different modeling language. Lessons learned from
   doing this were applied to the construction of DML. Our aim for the
   future is to reduce the human effort required to build dependency
   models. Machine learning techniques and automated model transformations
   are valuable techniques to support this cause.}},

Abstract = {{Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is one common cause of concrete
   deterioration and has been a growing concern for decades. Water, in the
   presence of reactive aggregates used to make concrete, plays a major
   role in the formation, sustainment, and promotion of this reaction. In
   this process, free water becomes bound within ASR gel, resulting in
   expansion and deterioration of concrete. Devising a test approach that
   is sensitive to the state of water (free or bound) has the potential to
   become a method-of-choice for ASR detection and evaluation, since such
   measures can be used to detect ASR and potentially quantify reaction
   progression. Microwave signals are sensitive to the presence of water,
   since the water relaxation frequency occurs in this frequency range.
   Recently, microwave nondestructive evaluation techniques have shown
   great potential to evaluate and distinguish between ASR-affected mortar
   samples and those without ASR gel. Given the complex chemistry of ASR
   products, their behavior is expected to differ at different microwave
   frequency bands. To evaluate the sensitivity of different frequencies to
   the presence of ASR, dielectric constant measurements were conducted at
   R-band (1.7-2.6 GHz), S-band (2.6-3.95 GHz), and X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz).
   This paper presents the measured results for mortar samples made with
   reactive and nonreactive aggregates. The measurement results and
   subsequent analyses aid in a better understanding of the microwave
   signals interaction with ASR-affected cement-based materials. Moreover,
   the results indicate that S-band appears to be the most appropriate
   frequency band for ASR evaluation in the microwave regime.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of diabetes on the collagen structure and material
   properties of the sclera are unknown but may be important to elucidate
   whether diabetes is a risk factor for major ocular diseases such as
   glaucoma. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the changes
   in scleral stiffness and collagen fiber alignment associated with
   diabetes. Posterior scleral shells from five diabetic donors and seven
   non-diabetic donors were pressurized to 30 mm Hg. Three-dimensional
   surface displacements were calculated during inflation testing using
   digital image correlation (DIC). After testing, each specimen was
   subjected to wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of its
   collagen organization. Specimen-specific finite element models of the
   posterior scleras were generated from the experimentally measured
   geometry. An inverse finite element analysis was developed to determine
   the material properties of the specimens, i.e., matrix and fiber
   stiffness, by matching DIC-measured and finite element predicted
   displacement fields. Effects of age and diabetes on the degree of fiber
   alignment, matrix and collagen fiber stiffness, and mechanical
   anisotropy were estimated using mixed effects models accounting for
   spatial autocorrelation. Older age was associated with a lower degree of
   fiber alignment and larger matrix stiffness for both diabetic and
   non-diabetic scleras. However, the age-related increase in matrix
   stiffness was 87\% larger in diabetic specimens compared to non-diabetic
   controls and diabetic scleras had a significantly larger matrix
   stiffness (p = 0.01). Older age was associated with a nearly significant
   increase in collagen fiber stiffness for diabetic specimens only (p =
   0.06), as well as a decrease in mechanical anisotropy for non-diabetic
   scleras only (p = 0.04). The interaction between age and diabetes was
   not significant for all outcomes. This study suggests that the
   age-related increase in scleral stiffness is accelerated in eyes with
   diabetes, which may have important implications in glaucoma.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study the generalized Darcy-Forchheimer model is used to
   characterize two-phase fluid flow where spatial flow characteristics may
   transition between Darcy and Forchheimer flow behavior. The local
   transition between the two flow regimes is characterized using the
   Forchheimer number as the criterion. A three-dimensional numerical model
   is developed that utilizes a control-volume method to simulate two-phase
   inertial, immiscible, and incompressible flow in a nondeformable
   homogeneous porous medium. The numerical model is validated by comparing
   its results with those obtained using a semianalytical solution of the
   Buckley-Leverett problem. The critical Forchheimer number is
   characterized using experimental data and is used to transition the
   local flow domain between Darcy and Forchheimer flow regions for both
   single-phase and multiphase analysis. The saturation-dependent
   distribution of the critical Forchheimer number is then used to analyze
   the Darcy and Forchheimer flow regions to provide a coupled solution to
   the problem. The proposed approach simulates injection of CO2 into
   saline aquifers. The simulation results show that local Forchheimer flow
   transition reveals critical conditions that need to be addressed in
   field applications. The findings are discussed in reference to deep
   saline injection of CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has attracted time-critical applications in
   wireless sensor networks because of its beacon-enabled mode and
   guaranteed timeslots (GTSs). However, the GTS management scheme's
   security mechanisms still leave the 802.15.4 medium access control
   vulnerable to attacks. Further, the existing techniques in the
   literature for securing 802.15.4 networks either focus on
   nonbeacon-enabled 802.15.4 networks or cannot defend against insider
   attacks for beacon-enabled 802.15.4 networks. In this paper, we
   illustrate this by demonstrating attacks on the availability and
   integrity of the beacon-enabled 802.15.4 network. To confirm the
   validity of the attacks, we implement the attacks using Tmote Sky motes
   for wireless sensor nodes, where the malicious node is deployed as an
   inside attacker. We show that the malicious node can freely exploit
   information retrieved from the beacon frames to compromise the integrity
   and availability of the network. To defend against these attacks, we
   present BCN-Sec, a protocol that ensures the integrity of data and
   control frames in beacon-enabled 802.15.4 networks. We implement
   BCN-Sec, and show its efficacy during various attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Socially Responsible Service Operations Management (SRSOM) can be
   defined as managerial activities to design and control (or optimize)
   various service operations that involve (or integrate) social
   responsibility toward legal, ethical, and environmental concerns. We
   propose a framework of research on SRSOM from the perspective of the
   service triad: target market, service concept, and service delivery
   system design choices. Unlike conventional service operations
   management, SRSOM focuses on: (1) non-voluntary citizens rather than
   voluntary customers as the main target group; (2) the provision of a
   general necessary service to citizens as the service concept; and (3)
   effectiveness and responsibility rather than efficiency as the service
   delivery system design choice. We also provide an overview of the
   related research on SRSOM published over the past 20 years, and attempt
   to place the seven papers shown in this collection in the proposed
   framework. While the current literature on SRSOM is limited, the number
   of papers has been steadily increasing. We hope that this paper will
   lead to further research on SRSOM among researchers and practitioners in

Abstract = {{Identifying the optimal screening strategies for breast cancer, the
   second leading cause of female cancer deaths in the US, is a major
   societal problem creating much controversy. The optimal screening
   strategies significantly depend on the sensitivity and specificity of
   the screening modality used. While the current state-of-the-art
   screening technology is mammography, its sensitivity or specificity may
   increase over time, or mammography may be replaced by another technology
   such as tomosynthesis in the near future. The purpose of this study is
   to identify the optimal use of the next generation of breast cancer
   screening modalities, whose sensitivity and specificity in clinical
   practice are either yet unknown or keep improving over time. Contrary to
   the prior literature that focuses on finding the optimal screening
   policy for given sensitivity and specificity values, we take an inverse
   optimization approach and focus on finding the range of sensitivity and
   specificity values, for which a given screening policy is optimal. To
   replicate breast cancer progression in the US population under various
   screening policies, we develop a parametric Partially Observable Markov
   Chain (POMC) model, which accounts for unobservable and age-specific
   disease progression, age-specific mortality, and the possibility of
   detecting cancer without a screening exam (either via self-detection or
   a clinical breast exam). We then formulate a nonlinear program (NLP) to
   identify the range of sensitivity and specificity values that optimize a
   particular screening policy. We show that this NLP is nonconvex for some
   parameter values, and hence difficult to solve. We prove several
   structural properties of the model, and by exploiting these properties,
   we propose a complete solution algorithm for this problem. We use real
   data in our numerical analysis and show that with the current
   technology, biennial breast cancer screening is slightly better than
   annual screening for the average-risk population. We also find that an
   improvement only in sensitivity (but not in specificity) will not change
   the current optimal policy. Furthermore, we characterize the lost
   potential quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due to suboptimal
   practice, and show that biennial screening is more robust than annual
   screening in the sense that it results in fewer lost QALYs due to
   choosing a suboptimal screening policy. Given that the design of
   multicenter clinical trials may be prohibitively expensive and lengthy,
   our findings may be especially valuable to policymakers in deciding
   about the optimal use of an emerging breast cancer screening modality,
   and adapting a new technology in different settings.}},

Abstract = {{The current market demand for high-efficiency, high-performance,
   small-sized electronic products has focused attention on the use of
   three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (IC) in the design of
   electronic packaging. Silicon wafers can be ground and polished to
   reduce their thickness and increase the chip stacking density. However,
   microcracks can result from the thinning and stacking process or during
   use of an electronic device over time; therefore, estimation of the
   cracking strength is an important issue in 3D IC packaging. This
   research combined the ball breaker test (BBT) with an acoustic emission
   (AE) system to measure the allowable force on a silicon die. To estimate
   the initial crack strength of a silicon die, the BBT was combined with
   finite-element (FE) analysis. The AE system can detect the initial crack
   and the subsequent bulk failure of the silicon die individually, thus
   avoiding overestimation of the die strength. In addition, the results of
   the modified ball breaker test showed that edge chipping did not affect
   the silicon die strength. However, the failure force and silicon die
   strength were reduced as the surface roughness of the test specimen
   increased. Thus, surface roughness must be controlled in the BBT to
   prevent underestimation of the silicon die strength.}},

Abstract = {{The predictive capability of the Sehitoglu-Boismier unified constitutive
   and life model for Mar-M247 Ni-base superalloy is extended from a
   maximum temperature of 871 degrees C to 1038 degrees C. The unified
   constitutive model suitable for thermomechanical loading is adapted and
   calibrated using the response from isothermal cyclic experiments
   conducted at temperatures from 500 degrees C to 1038 degrees C at
   different strain rates with and without dwells. The flow rule function
   and parameters as well as the temperature dependence of the evolution
   equation for kinematic hardening are established. Creep and stress
   relaxation are critical to capture in this elevated temperature regime.
   The coarse-grained polycrystalline microstructure exhibits a high
   variability in the predicted cyclic response due to the variation in the
   elastic response associated with the orientation of the crystallographic
   grains. The life model accounts for fatigue, creep, and environmental
   damage under both isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue (TMF).}},

Abstract = {{The corrosion behavior of 9Cr ferritic-martensitic heat-resistant steel
   was investigated in water and chloride environment at room temperature
   (RT). The results of linear polarization, electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), and potentiodynamics (PD) polarization tests on
   long-term exposure show that 9Cr ferritic-martensitic steel has weaker
   corrosion resistance and greater pitting corrosion tendency in higher
   chloride concentrations. Corresponding scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) observation displays that higher concentration chloride promotes
   the pitting initiation. During longterm exposure, pitting susceptibility
   decreases, the average pit size increases, and the density declines in
   higher chloride concentrations. Pits in the grains and along the grain
   boundaries are observed by optical microscope (OM), and it indicates
   that inclusions in grains and carbide particles at grain boundaries are
   the sites susceptible to pitting initiation.}},

Abstract = {{Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) provides a lower rank
   approximation of a matrix by a product of two nonnegative factors. NMF
   has been shown to produce clustering results that are often superior to
   those by other methods such as K-means. In this paper, we provide
   further interpretation of NMF as a clustering method and study an
   extended formulation for graph clustering called Symmetric NMF (SymNMF).
   In contrast to NMF that takes a data matrix as an input, SymNMF takes a
   nonnegative similarity matrix as an input, and a symmetric nonnegative
   lower rank approximation is computed. We show that SymNMF is related to
   spectral clustering, justify SymNMF as a general graph clustering
   method, and discuss the strengths and shortcomings of SymNMF and
   spectral clustering. We propose two optimization algorithms for SymNMF
   and discuss their convergence properties and computational efficiencies.
   Our experiments on document clustering, image clustering, and image
   segmentation support SymNMF as a graph clustering method that captures
   latent linear and nonlinear relationships in the data.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND RADIATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of buoyancy on
   heat transfer characteristics of supercritical carbon dioxide in heating
   mode. Turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers up to 60,000, at operating
   pressures of 7.5, 8.1, and 10.2 MPa, were tested in a round tube. Local
   heat transfer coefficients were obtained from measured wall temperatures
   over a large set of experimental parameters that varied inlet
   temperature from 20 to 55 degrees C, mass flux from 150 to 350 kg/m(2)s,
   and a maximum heat flux of 65 kW/m(2). Horizontal, upward, and downward
   flows were tested to investigate the unusual heat transfer
   characteristics due to the effect of buoyancy and flow acceleration
   caused by large variation in density. In the case of upward flow, severe
   localized deterioration in heat transfer was observed due to reduction
   in the turbulent shear stress and is characterized by a sharp increase
   in wall temperature. In the case of downward flow, turbulent shear
   stress is enhanced by buoyancy forces, leading to an enhancement in heat
   transfer. In the case of horizontal flow, flow stratification occurred,
   leading to a circumferential variation in wall temperature.
   Thermocouples mounted 180 degrees apart on the tube revealed that the
   wall temperatures on the top side are significantly higher than the
   bottom side of the tube. Buoyancy factor calculations for all the test
   cases indicated that buoyancy effects cannot be ignored even for
   horizontal flow at Reynolds numbers as high as 20,000. Experimentally
   determined Nusselt numbers are compared to existing correlations
   available in the literature. Existing correlations predicted the
   experimental data within +/- 30\%, with maximum deviation around the
   pseudocritical point.}},

Title = {{Latent Customer Needs Elicitation by Use Case Analogical Reasoning From
   Sentiment Analysis of Online Product Reviews}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Different from explicit customer needs that can be identified directly
   by analyzing raw data from the customers, latent customer needs are
   often implied in the semantics of use cases underlying customer needs
   information. Due to difficulties in understanding semantic implications
   associated with use cases, typical text mining-based methods can hardly
   identify latent customer needs, as opposite to keywords mining for
   explicit customer needs. This paper proposes a two-layer model for
   latent customer needs elicitation through use case reasoning. The first
   layer emphasizes sentiment analysis, aiming to identify explicit
   customer needs based on the product attributes and ordinary use cases
   extracted from online product reviews. Fuzzy support vector machines
   (SVMs) are developed to build sentiment prediction models based on a
   list of affective lexicons. The second layer is geared toward use case
   analogical reasoning, to identify implicit characteristics of latent
   customer needs by reasoning the semantic similarities and differences
   analogically between the ordinary and extraordinary use cases.
   Case-based reasoning (CBR) is utilized to perform case retrieval and
   case adaptation. A case study of Kindle Fire HD 7 in. tablet is
   developed to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed
   method.}},

   units, is truly entangled behavior observed. Interestingly, results from
   primitive path analysis of amorphous P3HT matches well with the observed
   onsets of inter-chain excitonic coherence with increased molecular
   weight. The simulations also indicate that the P3HT modulus saturates at
   1.6 GPa for chain lengths of 50-100 monomers, a result that compares
   well with experimental results. This work highlights the care that needs
   to be taken to accurately model P3HT morphologies in relation to
   experimental measurements. (c) 2015 The Authors. Journal of Polymer

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional radiation transport simulations play a key role in a
   number of problems found in nuclear science and engineering. When
   considering deterministic methods for solving the three-dimensional
   radiation transport equation, the S method of Carlson and Lee is one of
   the most commonly found techniques. The SF, method relies on a given set
   of ``discrete ordinates{''} or discrete directions in which radiation
   streams. This set of discrete ordinates also must form a quadrature
   (numerical integration) so that the angular flux moments can be
   estimated and the scattering source calculated. In this paper we review
   a number of recently developed angular quadrature sets and compare their
   performance on a number of reactor physics problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new Bayesian approach to the inverse problem of
   passive microwave rainfall retrieval. The proposed methodology {[}called
   the shrunken locally linear embedding algorithm for retrieval of
   precipitation (ShARP)] relies on a regularization technique and makes
   use of two joint dictionaries of coincident rainfall profiles and their
   corresponding up-welling spectral radiative fluxes. A sequential
   detection-estimation strategy is adopted, which basically assumes that
   similar rainfall intensity values and their spectral radiances live
   close to some sufficiently smooth manifolds with analogous local
   geometry. The detection step employs a nearest neighbor classification
   rule, whereas the estimation scheme is equipped with a constrained
   shrinkage estimator to ensure the stability of retrieval and some
   physical consistency. The algorithm is examined using coincident
   observations of the active precipitation radar and the passive microwave
   imager onboard the TRMM satellite. We present promising results of
   instantaneous rainfall retrieval for some tropical storms and mesoscale
   convective systems over ocean, land, and coastal zones. We provide
   evidence that the algorithm is capable of properly capturing different
   storm morphologies including high-intensity rain cells and trailing
   light rainfall, particularly over land and coastal areas. The algorithm
   is also validated at an annual scale for calendar year 2013 versus the
   standard (version 7) radar (2A25) and radiometer (2A12) rainfall
   products of the TRMM satellite.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is used to image and detect subterranean
   objects, for example, in landmine detection. Although full 3-D inversion
   of GPR measurements is possible for simple algorithms such as
   backprojection, it is impractical when using more advanced algorithms
   that involve l(1)-minimization. Many of the algorithms used for GPR
   imaging involve the storage, or online generation, of a huge dictionary
   matrix created from discretizing a high-dimensional nonlinear model.
   This parametric model includes all the target features that need to be
   extracted, including 3-D location, object orientation, and target type.
   As more parameters are added to the model, the dimensionality increases.
   If uniform sampling is done over high-dimensional parameter space, the
   size of the dictionary and the complexity of the inversion algorithms
   rapidly grow, exceeding the capability of real-time processors. This
   paper shows that strategic structuring of the dictionary, which takes
   advantage of translational invariance in the model, can reduce the
   dictionary storage by several orders of magnitude and exploit the fast
   Fourier transform for fast computation of previously highly impractical,
   bordering on impossible, 3-D GPR imaging problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the Cauchy problem for the compressible
   isentropic Euler-Boltzmann equations with vacuum in radiation
   hydrodynamics. We establish the existence of a unique local regular
   solution with vacuum by the theory of quasi-linear symmetric hyperbolic
   systems and some techniques dealing with the complexity caused by the
   coupling between fluid and radiation field under some physical
   assumptions for the radiation quantities. Moreover, it is interesting to
   show the non-global existence of regular solutions caused by the effect
   of vacuum for polytropic gases with adiabatic exponent 1 < gamma <= 3
   via some observations on the propagation of the radiation field.
   Compared with {[}11]{[}15]{[}20], some new initial conditions that will
   lead to the finite time blow-up for classical solutions have been
   introduced. These blow-up results tell us that the radiation effect on

Abstract = {{The optimization of resonance-tracking sensors relies critically on
   proper estimation of resonance detection error. We study this error in
   two common resonance detection algorithms: the absolute minimum method
   and the linear regression method. Closed-form relations for the error
   originating from additive noise are presented. The formulation
   accommodates the majority of lineshapes of practical interest and a wide
   variety of noise statistics. Lorentzian and Fano line shapes are studied
   here with further detail for their practical importance. It is discussed
   that while the performance of the absolute minimum method depends on the
   tail of the noise probability distribution function, for the linear
   regression method the total noise power is the determining
   characteristic of the noise. This fact is explained for the specific
   case of quantization noise. The results of this study enable a
   quantitative comparison of the performance of resonance-based sensors,
   which is a center piece in the optimization of their limit of detection.}},

Abstract = {{A temperature-compensated silicon micromechanical resonator with a
   quadratic temperature characteristic is realized by acoustic
   engineering. Energy-trapped resonance modes are synthesized by acoustic
   coupling of propagating and evanescent extensional waves in waveguides
   with rectangular cross section. Highly different temperature sensitivity
   of propagating and evanescent waves is used to engineer the linear
   temperature coefficient of frequency. The resulted quadratic temperature
   characteristic has a well-defined turn-over temperature that can be
   tailored by relative energy distribution between propagating and
   evanescent acoustic fields. A 76MHz prototype is implemented in single
   crystal silicon. Two high quality factor and closely spaced resonance
   modes, created from efficient energy trapping of extensional waves, are
   excited through thin aluminum nitride film. Having different evanescent
   wave constituents and energy distribution across the device, these modes
   show different turn over points of 67 degrees C and 87 degrees C for
   their quadratic temperature characteristic. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Transient activation of the highly conserved
   extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) establishes precise patterns
   of cell fates in developing tissues. Quantitative parameters of these
   transients are essentially unknown, but a growing number of studies
   suggest that changes in these parameters can lead to a broad spectrum of
   developmental abnormalities. We provide a detailed quantitative picture
   of an ERK-dependent inductive signaling event in the early Drosophila
   embryo, an experimental system that offers unique opportunities for
   high-throughput studies of developmental signaling. Our analysis reveals
   a spatiotemporal pulse of ERK activation that is consistent with a model
   in which transient production of a short-ranged ligand feeds into a
   simple signal interpretation system. The pulse of ERK signaling acts as
   a switch in controlling the expression of the ERK target gene. The
   quantitative approach that led to this model, based on the integration
   of data from fixed embryos and live imaging, can be extended to other
   developmental systems patterned by transient inductive signals.}},

Title = {{Associations between ambient air pollutant mixtures and pediatric asthma
   emergency department visits in three cities: a classification and
   regression tree approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Characterizing multipollutant health effects is challenging.
   We use classification and regression trees to identify multipollutant
   joint effects associated with pediatric asthma exacerbations and compare
   these results with those from a multipollutant regression model with
   continuous joint effects.
   Methods: We investigate the joint effects of ozone, NO2 and PM2.5 on
   emergency department visits for pediatric asthma in Atlanta (1999-2009),
   Dallas (2006-2009) and St. Louis (2001-2007). Daily concentrations of
   each pollutant were categorized into four levels, resulting in 64
   different combinations or ``Day-Types{''} that can occur. Days when all
   pollutants were in the lowest level were withheld as the reference
   group. Separate regression trees were grown for each city, with
   partitioning based on Day-Type in a model with control for confounding.
   Day-Types that appeared together in the same terminal node in all three
   trees were considered to be mixtures of potential interest and were
   included as indicator variables in a three-city Poisson generalized
   linear model with confounding control and rate ratios calculated
   relative to the reference group. For comparison, we estimated analogous
   joint effects from a multipollutant Poisson model that included terms
   for each pollutant, with concentrations modeled continuously.
   Results and discussion: No single mixture emerged as the most harmful.
   Instead, the rate ratios for the mixtures suggest that all three
   pollutants drive the health association, and that the rate plateaus in
   the mixtures with the highest concentrations. In contrast, the results
   from the comparison model are dominated by an association with ozone and
   suggest that the rate increases with concentration.
   Conclusion: The use of classification and regression trees to identify
   joint effects may lead to different conclusions than multipollutant
   models with continuous joint effects and may serve as a complementary
   approach for understanding health effects of multipollutant mixtures.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{111-121}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{In this study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are incorporated into a
   waterborne epoxy resin following two processing protocols that vary by
   order of addition. The processing protocols produce different levels of
   CNC dispersion in the resulting composites. The more homogeneously
   dispersed composite has a higher storage modulus and work of fracture at
   temperatures less than the glass transition temperature. Some properties
   related to the component interactions, such as thermal degradation and
   moisture content, are similar for both composite systems. The mechanism
   of dispersion is probed with electrophoretic measurements and electron
   microscopy, and based on these results, it is hypothesized that CNC
   preaddition facilitates the formation of a CNC-coated epoxy droplet,
   promoting CNC dispersion and giving the epoxide droplets added
   electrostatic stability. The implication of these structural changes in
   polymer network formation results in an extension of the epoxy and
   crosslinker mixture's pot life by three orders of magnitude. (C) 2015

   hemodynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The development of clinically applicable fluid-structure
   interaction (FSI) models of the left heart is inherently challenging
   when using in vivo cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data for
   validation, due to the lack of a well-controlled system where detailed
   measurements of the ventricular wall motion and flow field are available
   a priori. The purpose of this study was to (a) develop a clinically
   relevant, CMR-compatible left heart physical model; and (b) compare the
   left ventricular (LV) volume reconstructions and hemodynamic data
   obtained using CMR to laboratory-based experimental modalities.
   Methods: The LV was constructed from optically clear flexible silicone
   rubber. The geometry was based off a healthy patient's LV geometry
   during peak systole. The LV phantom was attached to a left heart
   simulator consisting of an aorta, atrium, and systemic resistance and
   compliance elements. Experiments were conducted for heart rate of 70
   bpm. Wall motion measurements were obtained using high speed
   stereo-photogrammetry (SP) and cine-CMR, while flow field measurements
   were obtained using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) and
   phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PC-CMR).
   Results: The model reproduced physiologically accurate hemodynamics
   (aortic pressure = 120/80 mmHg; cardiac output = 3.5 L/min). DPIV and
   PC-CMR results of the center plane flow within the ventricle matched,
   both qualitatively and quantitatively, with flow from the atrium into
   the LV having a velocity of about 1.15 m/s for both modalities. The
   normalized LV volume through the cardiac cycle computed from CMR data
   matched closely to that from SP. The mean difference between CMR and SP
   was 5.5 +/- 3.7 \%.
   Conclusions: The model presented here can thus be used for the purposes
   of: (a) acquiring CMR data for validation of FSI simulations, (b)
   determining accuracy of cine-CMR reconstruction methods, and (c)
   conducting investigations of the effects of altering anatomical
   variables on LV function under normal and disease conditions.}},

   48,000 genes and 200,000 transcripts are being expressed in this
   malignancy. We also find that RNA-seq provides much more detailed
   information on specific transcript expression patterns in
   clinico-genetic neuroblastoma subgroups than microarrays. To
   systematically compare the power of RNA-seq and microarray-based models
   in predicting clinical endpoints, we divide the cohort randomly into
   training and validation sets and develop 360 predictive models on six
   clinical endpoints of varying predictability. Evaluation of factors
   potentially affecting model performances reveals that prediction
   accuracies are most strongly influenced by the nature of the clinical
   endpoint, whereas technological platforms (RNA-seq vs. microarrays),
   RNA-seq data analysis pipelines, and feature levels (gene vs. transcript
   vs. exon-junction level) do not significantly affect performances of the
   models.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that RNA-seq outperforms microarrays in
   determining the transcriptomic characteristics of cancer, while RNA-seq
   and microarray-based models perform similarly in clinical endpoint
   prediction. Our findings may be valuable to guide future studies on the
   development of gene expression-based predictive models and their
   implementation in clinical practice.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Based on the scattering theory, simultaneously enhanced energy transport
   and suppressed momentum exchange are demonstrated by patterning
   doped-silicon surfaces in the near field. The radiative heat flux
   between dopedsilicon gratings exceeds that between planar surfaces and
   can be one or even two orders of magnitude higher than what is predicted
   by the geometry-based Derjaguin proximity approximation (PA). The
   underlying mechanism is interpreted as due to the excitation of
   broadband hyperbolic modes that facilitate photon tunneling, especially
   when the period is small. This is confirmed by a comparison of the
   results from the scattering theory with those from the effective-medium
   theory. The Casimir force, which may cause stiction and even failure of
   mesoscopic devices, is reduced with the grating structures as predicted
   by both the scattering theory and PA. However, depending on the
   separation distance, the PA may over-or underpredict the Casimir force.}},

Abstract = {{A facile one-step solution-phase chemical reduction method has been
   developed to synthesize Ag microsheets at room temperature. The
   morphology of Ag sheets is a regular hexagon more than 1 mu m in size
   and about 200 nm in thickness. The hexagonal Ag microsheets possess a
   smoother and straighter surface compared with that of the commercial Ag
   micrometer-sized flakes prepared by ball milling for electrically
   conductive adhesives (ECAs). The function of the reagents and the
   formation mechanism of Ag hexagonal microsheets are also investigated.
   For the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citrate facet-selective capping,
   the Ag atoms freshly reduced by N2H4 would orientationally grow alone on
   the \{111\} facet of Ag seeds, with the synergistically selective
   etching of irregular and small Ag particles by H2O2, to form Ag
   hexagonal microsheets. The hexagonal Ag microsheet-filled epoxy
   adhesives, as electrically conductive materials, can be easily printed
   on various substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), epoxy,
   glass, and flexible papers. The hexagonal Ag microsheet filled ECAs
   demonstrate lower bulk resistivity (approximately 8 x 10(-5) Omega cm)
   than that of the traditional Ag micrometer-sized-flake-filled ECAs with
   the same Ag content of 80 wt \% (approximately 1.2 x 10(-4) Omega cm).}},

Abstract = {{A stretchable-rubber-based (SR-based) triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   is developed that can not only harvest energy but also serve as
   self-powered multifunctional sensors. It consists of a layer of elastic
   rubber and a layer of aluminum film that acts as the electrode. By
   stretching and releasing the rubber, the changes of triboelectric charge
   distribution/density on the rubber surface relative to the aluminum
   surface induce alterations to the electrical potential of the aluminum
   electrode, leading to an alternating charge flow between the aluminum
   electrode and the ground. The unique working principle of the SR-based
   TENG is verified by the coupling of numerical calculations and
   experimental measurements. A comprehensive study is carried out to
   investigate the factors that may influence the output performance of the
   SR-based TENG. By integrating the devices into a sensor system, it is
   capable of detecting movements in different directions. Moreover, the
   SR-based TENG can be attached to a human body to detect diaphragm
   breathing and joint motion. This work largely expands the applications
   of TENG not only as effective power sources but also as active sensors;
   and opens up a new prospect in future electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting ambient mechanical energy is a key technology for realizing
   self-powered electronics, which has tremendous applications in wireless
   sensing networks, implantable devices, portable electronics, etc. The
   currently reported triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) mainly uses solid
   materials, so that the contact between the two layers cannot be 100\%
   with considering the roughness of the surfaces, which greatly reduces
   the total charge density that can be transferred and thus the total
   energy conversion efficiency. In this work, a liquid-metal-based
   triboelectric nanogenerator (LM-TENG) is developed for high power
   generation through conversion of mechanical energy, which allows a total
   contact between the metal and the dielectric. Due to that the
   liquid-solid contact induces large contacting surface and its shape
   adaptive with the polymer thin films, the LM-TENG exhibits a high output
   charge density of 430 mu C m(-2), which is four to five times of that
   using a solid thin film electrode. And its power density reaches 6.7 W
   m(-2) and 133 kW m(-3). More importantly, the instantaneous energy
   conversion efficiency is demonstrated to be as high as 70.6\%. This
   provides a new approach for improving the performance of the TENG for
   special applications. Furthermore, the liquid easily fluctuates, which
   makes the LM-TENG inherently suitable for vibration energy harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Heterostructures like InAs/GaSb superlattices (SLs) are distinctly
   different from well-studied ones like GaAs/AlAs SLs in terms of band
   alignment, common interface atom, and phonon spectrum overlapping of the
   constituents, which manifests as stark differences in their electronic
   and vibrational properties. This paper reports a comprehensive
   examination of all four types of phonon modes (confined, quasiconfined,
   extended, and interface) that have long been predicted for the InAs/GaSb
   SL, with the observation and interpretation of a set of phonon modes by
   performing cleaved edge mu-Raman study with polarization analysis.
   Furthermore, we show a signature of symmetry reduction from D-2d for
   GaAs/AlAs SL to C-2v for InAs/GaSb SL revealed as a phonon-polariton
   effect.}},

Title = {{Exploring associations between multipollutant day types and asthma
   morbidity: epidemiologic applications of self-organizing map ambient air
   quality classifications}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent interest in the health effects of air pollution
   focuses on identifying combinations of multiple pollutants that may be
   associated with adverse health risks.
   Objective: Present a methodology allowing health investigators to
   explore associations between categories of ambient air quality days
   (i.e., multipollutant day types) and adverse health.
   Methods: First, we applied a self-organizing map (SOM) to daily air
   quality data for 10 pollutants collected between January 1999 and
   December 2008 at a central monitoring location in Atlanta, Georgia to
   define a collection of multipollutant day types. Next, we conducted an
   epidemiologic analysis using our categories as a multipollutant metric
   of ambient air quality and daily counts of emergency department (ED)
   visits for asthma or wheeze among children aged 5 to 17 as the health
   endpoint. We estimated rate ratios (RR) for the association of
   multipollutant day types and pediatric asthma ED visits using a Poisson
   generalized linear model controlling for long-term, seasonal, and
   weekday trends and weather.
   Results: Using a low pollution day type as the reference level, we found
   significant associations of increased asthma morbidity in three of nine
   categories suggesting adverse effects when combinations of primary (CO,
   NO2, NOX, EC, and OC) and/or secondary (O-3, NH4, SO4) pollutants
   exhibited elevated concentrations (typically, occurring on dry days with
   low wind speed). On days with only NO3 elevated (which tended to be
   relatively cool) and on days when only SO2 was elevated (which likely
   reflected plume touchdowns from coal combustion point sources),
   estimated associations were modestly positive but confidence intervals
   included the null.
   Conclusions: We found that ED visits for pediatric asthma in Atlanta
   were more strongly associated with certain day types defined by
   multipollutant characteristics than days with low pollution levels;
   however, findings did not suggest that any specific combinations were
   more harmful than others. Relative to other health endpoints, asthma
   exacerbation may be driven more by total ambient pollutant exposure than
   by composition.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol is investigated over bulk ceria and
   ceria-zirconia catalysts with different elemental compositions. The
   reactions are performed in a flow reactor at 1atm and 275-400 degrees C.
   The primary products are phenol and catechol, whereas cresol and benzene
   are formed as secondary products. No products with hydrogenated rings
   are formed. The highest conversion of guaiacol is achieved over a
   catalyst containing 60mol\% CeO2 and 40mol\% ZrO2. Pseudo-first-order
   activation energies of 97-114kJmol(-1) are observed over the mixed metal
   oxide catalysts. None of the catalysts show significant deactivation
   during 72h on stream. The important physicochemical properties of the
   catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   temperature-programmed reduction, titration of oxygen vacancies, and
   temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. On the basis of these
   experimental results, the reasons for the observed reactivity trends are
   identified.}},

Title = {{A linear threshold-hurdle model for product adoption prediction
   incorporating sOcial network effects}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{307}},
Pages = {{95-109}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{With the development of social media, online social networks offer
   potential opportunities for firms to analyze user behaviors. Among many,
   one of the fundamental questions is how to predict product adoption, and
   the answer to this question lays the foundation for product adoption
   maximization and demand estimation in large social networks. However,
   due to the inherent challenges resulting from the dynamic diffusion
   mechanism in online social networks, such as modeling of activation
   thresholds and influence probability, differentiating between influence
   and adoption, and incorporating review content, traditional diffusion
   models are often not adequate enough to predict product adoption
   accurately. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a linear
   threshold-hurdle model to predict product adoption incorporating social
   network effects. First, we present a fine-grained activation threshold
   model based on the five categories of adopters. In addition, we identify
   three operational factors underlying social network effects, including
   interaction strength, structural equivalence, and social entity
   similarity, to model influence probabilities. Furthermore, we
   distinguish influence spread from adoption spread by introducing a
   tattle state, in which users express opinions without adopting the
   product. Finally, we introduce the notion of hurdle to capture the
   monetary aspect in users' decision making process of product adoption.
   Based on the proposed linear threshold-hurdle model, two data mining
   methods based on the rough set technique, namely, decision rules and
   decomposition trees, are employed to predict product adoption in a large
   social network. An empirical study of Kindle Fire HD 7 in. tablets is
   used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed model.
   The results demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model with
   average F-scores of 89.8\% for the week prediction model and of 86.7\%
   for the bi-week prediction model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   pertaining to the electronic structure. As a result, BLA is found to be
   a good predictor of NLO properties only when optimized geometries are
   considered, whereas BOA is more broadly applicable. Proper understanding
   of the distinction between BLA and BOA is critical when designing
   computational studies of NLO properties, especially for molecules in
   complex environments or in nonequilibrium geometries.}},

Title = {{Micro-CT Technique Is Well Suited for Documentation of Remodeling
   Processes in Murine Carotid Arteries}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The pathomechanisms of atherosclerosis and vascular remodelling are
   under intense research. Only a few in vivo tools to study these
   processes longitudinally in animal experiments are available. Here, we
   evaluated the potential of micro-CT technology.
   Methods
   Lumen areas of the common carotid arteries (CCA) in the ApoE(-/-)
   partial carotid artery ligation mouse model were compared between in
   vivo and ex vivo micro-CT technique and serial histology in a total of
   28 animals. AuroVist-15 nm nanoparticles were used as in vivo blood pool
   contrast agent in a Skyscan 1176 micro-CT at resolution of 18 mu meter
   voxel size and a mean x-ray dose of 0.5 Gy. For ex vivo imaging, animals
   were perfused with MicroFil and imaged at 9 mu meter voxel size. Lumen
   area was evaluated at postoperative days 7, 14, and 28 first by micro-CT
   followed by histology.
   Results
   In vivo micro-CT and histology revealed lumen loss starting at day 14.
   The lumen profile highly correlated (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001) between this
   two methods but absolute lumen values obtained by histology were lower
   than those obtained by micro-CT. Comparison of in vivo and ex vivo
   micro-CT imaging revealed excellent correlation (r = 0.83, P < 0.01).
   Post mortem micro-CT yielded a higher resolution than in vivo micro-CT
   but there was no statistical difference of lumen measurements in the
   partial carotid artery ligation model.
   Conclusion
   These data demonstrate that in vivo micro-CT is a feasible and accurate
   technique with low animal stress to image remodeling processes in the
   murine carotid artery.}},

Abstract = {{The neural systems controlling head movements are not well delineated in
   humans. It is not clear whether the ipsilateral or contralateral primary
   motor cortex is involved in turning the head right or left. Furthermore,
   the exact location of the neck motor area in the somatotopic
   organization of the motor homunculus is still debated and evidence for
   contributions from other brain regions in humans is scarce. Because
   currently available neuroimaging methods are not generally suitable for
   mapping brain activation patterns during head movements, we conducted
   fMRI scans during isometric tasks of the head. During isometric tasks,
   muscle contractions occur without an actual movement and they have been
   used to delineate patterns of brain activity related to movements of
   other body parts such as the hands. Healthy individuals were scanned
   during isometric head rotation or wrist extension. Isometric wrist
   extension was examined as a positive control and to establish the
   relative locations of head and hand regions in the motor cortex.
   Electromyographic recordings of neck and hand muscles during scanning
   ensured compliance with the tasks. Increased brain activity during
   isometric head rotation was observed bilaterally in the precentral
   gyrus, both medial and lateral to the hand area, as well the
   supplementary motor area, insula, putamen, and cerebellum. These
   findings clarify the location of the neck region in the motor homunculus
   and help to reconcile some of the conflicting results obtained in
   earlier studies.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) are widely used for alternating
   current (ac) line-filtering. However, their bulky size is becoming more
   and more incompatible with the rapid development of portable
   electronics. Here we report a scalable process to fabricate miniaturized
   graphene-based ac line-filters on flexible substrates at room
   temperature. In this work, graphene oxide (GO) is reduced by patterned
   metal interdigits at room temperature and used directly as the electrode
   material. The as-fabricated device shows a phase angle of -75.4 degrees
   at 120 Hz with a specific capacitance of 316 mu F/cm(2) and a RC time
   constant of 0.35 ms. In addition, it retains 97.2\% of the initial
   capacitance after 10000 charge/discharge cycles. These outstanding
   performance characteristics of our device demonstrate its promising to
   replace the conventional AECs for ac line filtering.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate brown carbon (BrC) in the atmosphere absorbs light at
   subvisible wavelengths and has poorly constrained but potentially large
   climate forcing impacts. BrC from biomass burning has virtually unknown
   lifecycle and atmospheric stability. Here, BrC emitted from intense
   wildfires was measured in plumes transported over 2days from two main
   fires, during the 2013 NASA SEAC4RS mission. Concurrent measurements of
   organic aerosol (OA) and black carbon (BC) mass concentration, BC
   coating thickness, absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent, and OA
   oxidation state reveal that the initial BrC emitted from the fires was
   largely unstable. Using back trajectories to estimate the transport time
   indicates that BrC aerosol light absorption decayed in the plumes with a
   half-life of 9 to 15 h, measured over day and night. Although most BrC
   was lost within a day, possibly through chemical loss and/or
   evaporation, the remaining persistent fraction likely determines the
   background BrC levels most relevant for climate forcing.}},

Abstract = {{In the history of manned spaceflight, environmental monitoring has
   relied heavily on archival sampling. However, with the construction of
   the International Space Station (ISS) and the subsequent extension in
   mission duration up to one year, an enhanced, real-time method for
   environmental monitoring is necessary. The station air is currently
   monitored for trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using gas
   chromatography-differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS) via the Air
   Quality Monitor (AQM), while water is analyzed to measure total organic
   carbon and biocide concentrations using the Total Organic Carbon
   Analyzer (TOCA) and the Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit
   (CWQMK), respectively. As mission scenarios extend beyond low Earth
   orbit, a convergence in analytical instrumentation to analyze both air
   and water samples is highly desirable. Since the AQM currently provides
   quantitative, compound-specific information for air samples and many of
   the targets in air are also common to water, this platform is a logical
   starting point for developing a multimatrix monitor. Here, we report on
   the interfacing of an electrothermal vaporization (ETV) sample
   introduction unit with a ground-based AQM for monitoring target analytes
   in water. The results show that each of the compounds tested from water
   have similar GC-DMS parameters as the compounds tested in air. Moreover,
   the ETV enabled AQM detection of dimethlsilanediol (DMSD), a compound
   whose analysis had proven challenging using other sample introduction
   methods. Analysis of authentic ISS water samples using the ETV-AQM
   showed that DMSD could be successfully quantified, while the
   concentrations obtained for the other compounds also agreed well with
   laboratory results.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze split cuts from the perspective of cut generating functions
   via geometric lifting. We show that a-cuts, a natural higher-dimensional
   generalization of the k-cuts of Cornuejols et al., give all the split
   cuts for the mixed-integer corner relaxation. As an immediate
   consequence we obtain that the k-cuts are equivalent to split cuts for
   the 1-row mixed-integer relaxation. Further, we show that split cuts for
   finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split cuts for
   the infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this
   equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split
   closure has arbitrarily bad integrality gap. This complements the
   mixed-integer example provided by Basu et al. (2011). (C) 2014 Elsevier

   at the surface increases surface trap density and trap depth, which
   improves responsivity and high temperature stability while the GaN layer
   improves the magnitude of the diode current. The BGaN layer's columnar

   decorated interfaces: Evidence of Lewis base and Bronsted acid sites -
   Influence on chemical sensing}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Nanostructure metal oxide decorated n-type extrinsic porous silicon (PS)
   semiconductor interfaces are modified through in-situ interaction with
   acidic ethane and butane thiols (EtSH, BuSH) and basic diethyl sulfide
   (Et2S). Highly sensitive conductometric sensor evaluations and X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy demonstrate the effect of sulfur group
   functionalization modifying the acidity of the metal oxides and their
   interaction with NH3. SEM micrographs demonstrate that the sulfur
   treated particles are less than 30 nm in size. EDAX studies confirm the
   chemical composition of the modified nanoparticles and suggest the
   surface interaction of the sulfides and thiols. The acidic thiols can
   form Bronsted acidic sites enhancing the acidity of the metal oxides,
   thus broadening the initial metal oxide acidity range. The sulfides
   interact to lower the Lewis acidity of nanostructured metal oxide sites.
   Conductometric response matrices with NH3 at room temperature,
   corresponding to the thiol and sulfide treated nanostructures of the
   metal oxides TiO2, SnOx, NixO, CuxO, and AuxO (x >> 1) are evaluated for
   a dominant electron transduction process forming the basis for
   reversible chemical sensing in the absence of chemical bond formation.
   Treatment with the acidic thiols enhances the metal center acidity. It
   is suggested that the thiols can interact to increase the Bronsted
   acidity of the doped metal oxide surface if they maintain SH bonds. This
   process may account for the shift in Lewis acidity as the Bronsted acid
   sites counter the decrease in Lewis acidity resulting from the
   interaction of S-(CHx)(y) groups. In contrast, treatment with basic Et2S
   decreases the Lewis acidity of the metal oxide sites, enhancing the
   basicity of the decorated interface. XPS measurements indicate a change
   in binding energy (BE) of the metal and oxygen centers. The observed
   changes in conductometric response do not represent a simple increase in
   surface acidity or basicity but involve a change in the mismatch of
   molecular electronic structure with the NH3 analyte. The nature of this
   interaction, coupled with the ability to transfer electrons to the
   extrinsic semiconductor, is explained using the developing IHSAB model.

Abstract = {{The renaissance in the use of encephalography-based research methods to
   probe the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is well afoot
   and continues to advance. Building on the platform of neuroimaging
   evidence on brain circuit models, magnetoencephalography, scalp
   electroencephalography, and even invasive electroencephalography are now
   being used to characterize brain network dysfunctions that underlie
   major depressive disorder using brain oscillation measurements and
   associated treatment responses. Such multiple encephalography modalities
   provide avenues to study pathologic network dynamics with high temporal
   resolution and over long time courses, opportunities to complement
   neuroimaging methods and findings, and new approaches to identify
   quantitative biomarkers that indicate critical targets for brain
   therapy. Such goals have been facilitated by the ongoing testing of
   novel invasive neuromodulation therapies, notably, deep brain
   stimulation, where clinically relevant treatment effects can be
   monitored at multiple brain sites in a time-locked causal manner. We
   review key brain rhythms identified in major depressive disorder as
   foundation for development of putative biomarkers for objectively
   evaluating neuromodulation success and for guiding deep brain
   stimulation or other target-based neuromodulation strategies for
   treatment-resistant depression patients.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent sampling is an example of nonuniform sampling that occurs in
   multichannel systems such as analog-to-digital converters, synthetic

   sampling theorems have been developed that guarantee that a bandlimited
   signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its recurrent samples, little
   has been said about the case where the signal is not perfectly
   bandlimited. We compare the impact of out-of-band energy for uniform and
   recurrent sampling. The results are extended to the case of sampling a
   wide-sense stationary (WSS) random process. An application to
   multichannel synthetic aperture imaging is also included to illustrate
   these results.}},

Abstract = {{There exist many well-established techniques to recover sparse signals
   from compressed measurements with known performance guarantees in the
   static case. More recently, new methods have been proposed to tackle the
   recovery of time-varying signals, but few benefit from a theoretical
   analysis. In this paper, we give theoretical guarantees for the
   Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) and its continuous-time
   analogue the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to perform this
   tracking in real time. ISTA is a well-known digital solver for static
   sparse recovery, whose iteration is a first-order discretization of the
   LCA differential equation. Our analysis is based on the Restricted
   Isometry Property (RIP) and shows that the outputs of both algorithms
   can track a time-varying signal while compressed measurements are
   streaming, even when no convergence criterion is imposed at each time
   step. The l(2)-distance between the target signal and the outputs of
   both discrete-and continuous-time solvers is shown to decay to a bound
   that is essentially optimal. Our analysis is supported by simulations on
   both synthetic and real data.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal-melt interfacial free energy is an important quantity
   governing many kinetic phenomena including solidification and crystal
   growth. Although general calculation methods are available, it is still
   difficult to obtain the interfacial energies that differ only slightly
   due to anisotropy. Here, we report such a calculation of Al crystal-melt
   interfacial energy based on the general framework of the capillary
   fluctuation method (CFM). The subtle dependence of both the melting
   temperature and interfacial free energy at melting temperature on the
   crystal interface orientation was examined. For Al, the average melting
   temperature is obtained at 934.79 +/- 5 K and the orientationally
   averaged mean interfacial free energy is 98.35 mJ/m(2). In addition, the
   anisotropy of the interfacial free energy is found weak, nevertheless
   with the values ranked as gamma(100) > gamma(110) > gamma(111).}},

   the addition of cellulose nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Freeze-dried cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were dispersed in the
   thermoplastic polyurethane {[}Pellethane 2363-55D (P55D)] by a solvent
   casting method to fabricate CNC-reinforced nanocomposites. This study
   demonstrated that the addition of small amounts (1-5 wt \%) of CNCs to
   P55D increased the thermal degradation temperature while maintaining a
   similar stiffness, strength, and elongation of the neat P55D. CNC
   additions to P55D did not alter the glass-transition temperature, but
   the onset decomposition temperature was shifted from 286 to 327 degrees
   C when 1 wt \% CNCs was dispersed in the matrix. The higher onset
   decomposition temperature was attributed to the formation of hydrogen
   bonds between the hydroxyl groups on the CNC surface and urethane groups
   in the hard block of P55D. The ultimate tensile strength and strain to
   failure (epsilon(f)) of the nanocomposites were minimally affected by
   additions up to 5 wt \% CNCs, whereas the elastic modulus was increased
   by about 70\%. The observation that epsilon(f) was unchanged with the
   addition of up to 5 wt \% CNCs suggested that the flow/sliding of the
   hard blocks and chains were not hindered by the presence of the CNCs
   during plastic deformation. The ramifications of this study was that CNC
   additions resulted in wider processing temperatures of P55D for various
   biomedical devices while maintaining a similar stiffness, strength, and
   elongation. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015,

Abstract = {{CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 display much stronger negative thermal expansion (NTE)
   (alpha(L100 K) similar to -18 and -22 ppm K-1, respectively) than ZrW2O8
   and other corner-shared framework structures. Their NTE is comparable to
   that reported for framework solids containing multiatom bridges, such as
   metal cyanides and metal-organic frameworks. However, they are formable
   as ceramics, transparent over a wide wavelength range and can be handled
   in air; these characteristics can be beneficial for applications. The
   NTE of CaZrF6 is strongly temperature-dependent, and first-principles
   calculations show that it is largely driven by vibrational modes below
   similar to 150 cm(-1). CaZrF6 is elastically soft with a bulk modulus
   (K-300K) of 37 GPa and, upon compression, starts to disorder at similar
   to 400 MPa. The strong NTE of CaZrF6, which remains cubic to <10 K,
   contrasts with cubic CoZrF6, which only displays modest NTE above its
   rhombohedral to cubic phase transition at similar to 270 K. CaZrF6 and
   CaHfF6 belong to a large and compositionally diverse family of
   materials, A(II)B(IV)F(6), providing for a detailed exploration of the
   chemical and structural factors controlling NTE and many opportunities
   for the design of controlled thermal expansion materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this response, we clarify some of the misconceptions that were
   brought up by Pal's Comments about our manuscript {[}S. A. Faroughi and
   C. Huber, J. Appl. Phys. 117, 055104 (2015)]. The main issue that was
   raised is that we account for the correction on the excluded volume (the
   net volume of the continuous phase in a finite composite decreases with
   increasing filler content) twice. We show here that this statement is
   incorrect and that our model is consistent with other models derived
   from a different standpoint. We also address the other comments raised

Title = {{Size- and structure-dependence of thermal and mechanical behaviors of
   single-crystalline and polytypic superlattice ZnS nanowires}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to study the thermal
   and mechanical behaviors of single-crystalline wurtzite (WZ),
   zinc-blende (ZB), and polytypic superlattice ZnS nanowires containing
   alternating WZ and ZB regions with thicknesses between 1.85 nm and 29.62
   nm under tensile loading. The wires analyzed have diameters between 1.77
   nm and 5.05 nm. The Green-Kubo method is used to calculate the thermal
   conductivity of the wires at different deformed states. A
   non-equilibrium MD approach is used to analyze the thermal transport
   behavior at the interfaces between different structural regions in the
   superlattice nanowires (SLNWs). The Young's modulus and thermal
   conductivity of ZB nanowires are approximately 2\%-12\% and 23\%-35\%
   lower than those of WZ nanowires, respectively. The lower initial
   residual compressive stress due to higher irregularity of surface atoms
   causes the Young's modulus of ZB nanowires to be lower. The dependence
   of the thermal conductivity on structure comes from differences in
   phonon group velocities associated with the different wires. The thermal
   conductivity of polytypic superlattice nanowires is up to 55\% lower
   than that of single-crystalline nanowires, primarily because of phonon
   scattering at the interfaces and the resulting lower effective phonon
   mean free paths for each structural region. As the periodic lengths
   (1.85-29.62 nm) and specimen lengths (14.81-59.24 nm) of SLNWs decrease,
   these effects become more pronounced, causing the thermal conductivity
   to further decrease by up to 30\%. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the catalytic performance of novel In2O3-Ga2O3
   mixed oxides synthesized by the alcoholic-coprecipitation method for
   propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Reactivity measurements reveal that the
   activities of In2O3-Ga2O3 catalysts are 1-3-fold (on an active metal
   basis) and 12-28-fold (on a surface area basis) higher than an
   In2O3-Ga2O3 catalyst in terms of C3H8 conversion. The structure,
   composition, and surface properties of the In2O3-Ga2O3 catalysts are
   thoroughly characterized. NH3-TPD shows that the binary oxide system
   generates more acid sites than the corresponding single-component
   catalysts. Raman spectroscopy suggests that catalysts that produce coke
   of a more graphitic nature suppress cracking reactions, leading to
   higher C3H6 selectivity. Lower reaction temperature also leads to higher
   C3H6 selectivity by slowing down the rate of side reactions. XRD, XPS,
   and XANES measurements, strongly suggest that metallic indium and In2O3
   clusters are formed on the catalyst surface during the reaction. The
   agglomeration of In2O3 domains and formation of a metallic indium phase
   are found to be irreversible under O-2 or H-2 treatment conditions used
   here, and may be responsible for loss of activity with increasing time
   on stream. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Experimental route to chaos of an external-cavity semiconductor laser}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{We report experimental bifurcation diagrams of a semiconductor laser,
   biased well above threshold, subjected to external optical feedback. As
   feedback is increased, we see a quasiperiodic route to chaos interrupted
   by several windows of periodicity corresponding to limit cycles,
   differing in frequency by multiples of the external-cavity free-spectral
   range that have developed around external-cavity modes (ECMs) whose
   frequency is slightly larger than that of the solitary laser. Successive
   windows correspond to the transition between two limit cycles either on
   the same or neighboring ECMs. For larger feedback, the laser operates in
   a chaotic regime around numerous negatively shifted external-cavity
   modes. These experimental observations detail the bifurcations leading
   to fully developed chaos in this system, and further provide detailed
   insight on the standard theoretical framework applied to these lasers.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of eusociality is one of the major transitions in
   evolution, but the underlying genomic changes are unknown. We compared
   the genomes of 10 bee species that vary in social complexity,
   representing multiple independent transitions in social evolution, and
   report three major findings. First, many important genes show evidence
   of neutral evolution as a consequence of relaxed selection with
   increasing social complexity. Second, there is no single road map to
   eusociality; independent evolutionary transitions in sociality have
   independent genetic underpinnings. Third, though clearly independent in
   detail, these transitions do have similar general features, including an
   increase in constrained protein evolution accompanied by increases in
   the potential for gene regulation and decreases in diversity and
   abundance of transposable elements. Eusociality may arise through
   different mechanisms each time, but would likely always involve an
   increase in the complexity of gene networks.}},

Title = {{Adsorption of carboxylate on calcium carbonate (10 (1)over-bar 4)

Abstract = {{The wettability of the hydrophilic calcium carbonate surface is altered
   by the adsorption of amphiphilic carboxylate compounds forming an
   oleophilic layer on the surface. In this study, we characterize the
   adsorption of carboxylates such as benzoate and stearate on the calcium
   carbonate (10 (1) over tilde 4) surface using density functional theory
   (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. From our DFT computations
   using PBE-D3 method, the binding energy of a carboxylate adsorbed on the
   calcium carbonate in water phase is calculated to be -29.45 kcal/mol,
   which is utilized to develop a new set of force field parameters for
   molecular simulations. The optimal adsorption density of the
   carboxylates on the carbonate surface is determined using the newly
   developed force field: the adsorption of benzoate shows two probable
   adsorption densities at 20.20 angstrom(2)/molecule and 40.40
   angstrom(2)/molecule, while the stearate adsorption has a single optimum
   at 20.20 angstrom(2)/molecule, which is in a good agreement with the
   experimental results. Lastly, through performing the steered molecular
   dynamics simulations to characterize the potential of mean force for the
   desorption of the carboxylate molecules from the calcium carbonate
   surface, the binding free energy is calculated as -148 kcal/mol in the
   presence of oil phase. This indicates that due to the stability of the
   carboxylate monolayer on calcium carbonate, the spontaneous desorption
   of carboxylate molecule from the calcium carbonate surface in nature is
   not likely. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{474}},

Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{We investigate a micelle consisting of 60 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
   molecules in water phase using molecular dynamics simulation method. The
   dimension of the micelle is evaluated as similar to 16 angstrom and
   similar to 21 angstrom for the radius of gyration and geometric radius,
   respectively, which are well agreed with the previous studies. By
   calculating the formation energy, it is found that the stability of
   micelle is driven by the interaction of the micelle with water phase.
   Via Connolly surface analysis, it was found that similar to 58\% of the
   micelle surface is occupied by the hydrophobic alkyl tails. The
   conformation analysis shows that the individual SDS molecules are bent
   within the micelle and are not aligned radially from the center-of-mass
   of the micelle. However, it turns out that the micelle is well packed
   with a small free volume (0.35\% of the micelle volume) which does not
   allow the diffusion-in of water molecules. The PMF required to drag a
   water molecule from water phase to the center-of-mass of micelle is
   calculated as similar to 10 kcal/mol while the PMF for a SDS molecule to
   be dissociated from the micelle is similar to 13 kcal/mol, both of which
   demonstrate that the micellization is driven by minimizing unfavorable
   interaction of hydrophobic alkyl tail of SDS molecule with water phase.

Abstract = {{We propose a simple method of characterizing the (Lewis) acid-base
   behavior of oil-soluble non-ionic surfactants at the interface of
   nonpolar solvents with a polar phase. Using interfacial tensiometry, we
   probe the effective acidic and basic response of nonpolar surfactant
   solutions to contact with a variety of polar reference liquids. The
   measured interfacial tensions are used as experimental coefficients in a
   set of equations borrowed from the thermodynamic ``surface energy
   component model{''} of van Oss, Chaudhury, and Good (vOCG), but used
   here in a more heuristic fashion and with a revised interpretation of
   the parameters extracted to describe the dispersive, acidic, and basic
   character of the sample. We test the proposed characterization method
   using alkane solutions of purified polyisobutylene succinimide (PIBS)
   surfactants with systematic structural variations, and observe that the
   inferred parameter values are consistent with, and sensitive to, subtle
   differences in the surfactant chemistry. This suggests the possibility
   to compare different surfactant solutions semi-quantitatively with
   regard to their acidic and basic character. In a further illustration of
   the proposed analysis, we characterize a solution of commercial PIBS
   surfactant in hexane, and find that the parameters obtained by the
   proposed method correctly predict the solution interfacial tension with
   a polar liquid not included among the chosen reference liquids.}},

Abstract = {{A newly designed counter electrode (CE) composed of a hybridized
   structure of Au networks and cobalt sulfide (CoS) nanowire (NW) arrays
   is presented for flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and quantum
   dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The sheet resistance of the Au
   networks electrode is approximate to 10 sq(-1) with a transmittance up
   to 90\%. The CoS NWs/Au hybridized networks show excellent
   electrocatalytic activity and lower charge transfer resistance toward
   the reduction of both S-x(2-) ions and I-3(-) ions. The hybridized
   electrode exhibits remarkable mechanical strength and no obvious changes
   in morphology and sheet resistance even after 500 bending cycles; 3.13\%
   and 4.73\% efficiency are obtained by utilizing CoS/Au hybridized
   networks as CEs in TiO2 nanotube array (TNAR) based DSSCs and QDSSCs.
   This work provides a novel approach to fabricate flexible, transparent,
   conductive, and catalytically active electrodes for QDSSCs and DSSCs and
   pomotes the development of transparent percolation conductive films for

Abstract = {{In this paper, an infrastructure that enables the association of a
   unique identification (ID) number to objects in the physical world is
   proposed. The system consists of a small tag that can be attached to any
   object. The tag is powered optically and establishes an optical
   communication link with a Reader. The Reader device can write a unique
   ID in the tag memory and can also readout the number. Each ID is also
   stored in a cloud database, which allows for associations of other
   attributes to the tag. By removing the need for a battery, using optical
   instead of RF communication, and minimizing the need for storing much
   information besides a single number, the size requirements on the tag
   are significantly reduced. A larger scale prototype is developed and
   end-to-end operation of the infrastructure is demonstrated. Prototyping
   is comprised the optical tag with active photovoltaic area of 1.44 mm(2)
   and dimension of 9.7 mm x 6.9 mm, a Reader that optically interrogates
   with tag through 9600 baud UART protocol, a two-columned debatable for
   TagID and TagInfo data maintenance and a mobile application. In the end,
   basic packaging requirements of the tags are discussed and custom
   spherical packages with 1.8-mm diameter are developed. In the future, it
   is possible to mass produce the tags at a very low cost and attach them
   to many physical objects in the environment-creating a bridge between
   the physical and the cyber worlds.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional linear dynamic elasticity problem formulation and
   solution for a generally asymmetric sandwich plate consisting of core
   and face sheets that are orthotropic, and subjected to blast loading, is
   presented. Laplace transforms are used to obtain ordinary differential
   equations in the complex Laplace space (with the variable being the
   through-thickness coordinate), which are subsequently solved in closed
   form for a simply supported plate, with the solution involving a cubic
   characteristic equation with complex coefficients. Subsequently, the
   time response is obtained by a numerical inverse Laplace transform by
   use of the Euler method. A realistic material and blast case is used to
   demonstrate the transient behavior for the displacements and face
   sheet/core interfacial transverse normal and shear stresses. The
   elasticity results are compared with the predictions of the first-order
   shear deformation plate theory as well as a high-order sandwich panel
   theory. This dynamic elasticity solution can serve as a benchmark in

Abstract = {{Point-based rut bar systems are commonly used by transportation
   agencies. However, potential measurement errors exist in these systems
   because of the limited number of sample points (e.g. 3 to 31 points).
   Now, advanced sensing technology can acquire high-resolution transverse
   profiles of more than 4,000 points using 3D line laser imaging
   technology (termed the 3D line laser hereafter). This study, sponsored
   by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) Research and
   Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) program, is a) to explore
   the feasibility of using the 3D line laser to accurately and reliably
   measure rut depth, and b) to quantify the potential rut depth
   measurement errors using point-based rut bar systems. The rut depth
   measurement accuracy and repeatability of the 3D line laser were
   validated in laboratory and field tests. Results show that the absolute
   rut-depth measurement error is less than 3 mm, and, therefore, the
   transverse profiles acquired by the 3D line laser can be used to
   quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of point-based rut
   bar systems. Rut bar systems having 3 to 31 sensors were simulated using
   transverse profiles acquired by the 3D line laser. Test results show
   that the relative rut-depth measurement error generally decreases with
   the increasing number of laser sensors. However, the trend is unclear
   for rut bar systems with fewer sensors because the rut shape affects the
   rut depth measurement error more than the number of sensors. Thus, a
   3-point rut bar system could outperform a 5-point system occasionally.
   Test results also show that the commonly used 3-point and 5-point rut
   bar systems can underestimate rut depth by 16\% to 51\% and 22\% to
   64\%, respectively. The relative rut-depth measurement error is less
   than 10\% only when the number of sensors is greater than 29.}},

Abstract = {{Georgia is considered to have one of the best concrete pavement design
   and materials in the U.S. Designs for joint plain concrete pavement
   (JPCP) have evolved over time. Analysis of long-term pavement condition
   data is still very necessary for evaluating the actual performance of
   different pavement designs and rehabilitation strategies to better
   understand the actual performance. Since the 1960s, various designs of
   jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), including non-doweled pavement
   on a soil or soil cement base (ND), non-doweled pavement on an improved
   base (ND-IB), and doweled pavement on an improved base (D-IB), have been
   constructed at different periods of time on interstate highways in
   Georgia with the expectation of improving pavement performance and life.
   This paper presents a critical assessment of long-term performance of
   JPCP using 40-years of pavement condition data collected by the Georgia
   Department of Transportation (GDOT) to quantitatively evaluate the
   actual performance of different JPCP designs. Pavement service life,
   i.e., time to reach the first major concrete pavement restoration, was
   analyzed using statewide data (837 survey-lanemiles of JPCPs). The
   service life of ND, ND-IB, and D-IB is an average of 17,21(+) and 25(+)
   years, respectively, which shows a 47\% improvement in the serve life of
   D-IB. Analyses of the traffic and distress data were conducted on
   selected projects. Results show all three categories of JPCP designs
   outperformed the designed equivalent single axle loads (ESALs), and they
   carried approximately two to three times the number of the designed
   ESALs. ND, ND-IB, and D-IB projects carried 18 million ESALs in 23
   years, 22 million ESALs in 20 years, and 30 million ESALs in 33 years,
   respectively. In summary, the later designs have improved pavement
   service life, in terms of years and the accumulated ESALs, especially
   with the introduction of dowel bar use. In addition, the actual ESALs
   for all designs have exceeded the expected/design ESALs. The findings in
   this study reveal the actual JCCP performance and provide pavement
   engineers a better understanding of the long-term performance of JPCP.}},

Abstract = {{The popularity and influence of reviews, make sites like Yelp ideal
   targets for malicious behaviors. We present Marco, a novel system that
   exploits the unique combination of social, spatial and temporal signals
   gleaned from Yelp, to detect venues whose ratings are impacted by
   fraudulent reviews. Marco increases the cost and complexity of attacks,
   by imposing a tradeoff on fraudsters, between their ability to impact
   venue ratings and their ability to remain undetected. We contribute a
   new dataset to the community, which consists of both ground truth and
   gold standard data. We show that Marco significantly outperforms
   state-of-the-art approaches, by achieving 94\% accuracy in classifying
   reviews as fraudulent or genuine, and 95.8\% accuracy in classifying
   venues as deceptive or legitimate. Marco successfully flagged 244
   deceptive venues from our large dataset with 7,435 venues, 270,121
   reviews and 195,417 users. Furthermore, we use Marco to evaluate the
   impact of Yelp events, organized for elite reviewers, on the hosting
   venues. We collect data from 149 Yelp elite events throughout the US. We
   show that two weeks after an event, twice as many hosting venues
   experience a significant rating boost rather than a negative impact. (C)

Abstract = {{Unmanned system technologies are reaching maturity in today's naval
   maritime operations. Specifically, the U.S. Navy plans to use unmanned
   vehicles in littoral-based unmanned vehicle (UV) sentry missions.
   Examples of these UV sentry missions include Mine-Countermeasures (MCM),
   Surface Warfare (SUW), and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). Each mission
   uses a variety of unmanned vehicle architectures which can be operated
   remotely or autonomously. Communications between unmanned assets and the
   command unit become progressively more essential as the system
   complexity increases. This paper details a mission planning tool, the
   Adaptive Communications Framework for Unmanned Vehicles (ACF-UV). ACF-UV
   uses advanced communication models to account for signal loss in both
   above-water and underwater environments. The inter-vehicle communication
   is tracked during the simulation to show the impact of communications
   technologies and operational environment on mission success. This paper
   presents how the mission scenarios are modeled, how the framework can be
   further developed, and it uses a case study to show how the impact of
   communications on mission success can be evaluated and used to improve
   mission planning. The case study explored in this paper demonstrates the
   applicability of the tool for mission planning and the feasibility of
   deploying unmanned assets to perform these missions.}},

Title = {{DTI template-based estimation of cardiac fiber orientations from 3D
   ultrasound}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2915-2924}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Cardiac muscle fibers directly affect the mechanical,
   physiological, and pathological properties of the heart.
   Patient-specific quantification of cardiac fiber orientations is an
   important but difficult problem in cardiac imaging research. In this
   study, the authors proposed a cardiac fiber orientation estimation
   method based on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images and a cardiac
   fiber template that was obtained from magnetic resonance diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI).
   Methods: A DTI template-based framework was developed to estimate
   cardiac fiber orientations from 3D ultrasound images using an animal
   model. It estimated the cardiac fiber orientations of the target heart
   by deforming the fiber orientations of the template heart, based on the
   deformation field of the registration between the ultrasound geometry of
   the target heart and the MRI geometry of the template heart. In the
   experiments, the animal hearts were imaged by high-frequency ultrasound,
   T1-weighted MM, and high-resolution DTI.
   Results: The proposed method was evaluated by four different parameters:
   Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), target errors, acute angle error
   (AAE), and inclination angle error (IAE). Its ability of estimating
   cardiac fiber orientations was first validated by a public database.
   Then, the performance of the proposed method on 3D ultrasound data was
   evaluated by an acquired database. Their average values were 95.4\%
   2.0\% for the DSC of geometric registrations, 21.0 degrees +/- 0.76
   degrees for AAE, and 19.4 degrees +/- 1.2 degrees for JAB of fiber
   orientation estimations. Furthermore, the feasibility of this framework
   was also performed on 3D ultrasound images of a beating heart.
   Conclusions: The proposed framework demonstrated the feasibility of
   using 3D ultrasound imaging to estimate cardiac fiber orientation of in
   vivo beating hearts and its further improvements could contribute to
   understanding the dynamic mechanism of the beating heart and has the
   potential to help diagnosis and therapy of heart disease. (C) 2015

Title = {{Unprecedented study of the broadband emission of Mrk 421 during flaring
   activity in March 2010}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{578}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Context. Because of its proximity, Mrk 421 is one of the best sources on
   which to study the nature of BL Lac objects. Its proximity allows us to
   characterize its broadband spectral energy distribution (SED).
   Aims. The goal is to better understand the mechanisms responsible for
   the broadband emission and the temporal evolution of Mrk 421. These
   mechanisms may also apply to more distant blazars that cannot be studied
   with the same level of detail.
   Methods. A flare occurring in March 2010 was observed for 13 consecutive
   days (from MJD 55 265 to MJD 55 277) with unprecedented wavelength
   coverage from radio to very high energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-rays
   with MAGIC, VERITAS, Whipple, Fermi-LAT, MAXI, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT,
   and several optical and radio telescopes. We modeled the day-scale SEDs
   with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models,
   investigated the physical parameters, and evaluated whether the observed
   broadband SED variability can be associated with variations in the
   relativistic particle population.
   Results. The activity of Mrk 421 initially was high and then slowly
   decreased during the 13-day period. The flux variability was remarkable
   at the X-ray and VHE bands, but it was minor or not significant at the
   other bands. The variability in optical polarization was also minor.
   These observations revealed an almost linear correlation between the
   X-ray flux at the 2-10 keV band and the VHE gamma-ray flux above 200
   GeV, consistent with the gamma-rays being produced by inverse-Compton
   scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime in the framework of SSC models.
   The one-zone SSC model can describe the SED of each day for the 13
   consecutive days reasonably well, which once more shows the success of
   this standard theoretical scenario to describe the SEDs of VHE BL Lacs
   such as Mrk 421. This flaring activity is also very well described by a
   two-zone SSC model, where one zone is responsible for the quiescent
   emission, while the other smaller zone, which is spatially separated
   from the first, contributes to the daily variable emission occurring at
   X-rays and VHE gamma-rays. The second blob is assumed to have a smaller
   volume and a narrow electron energy distribution with 3 x 10(4) < gamma
   < 6 x 10(5), where. is the Lorentz factor of the electrons. Such a
   two-zone scenario would naturally lead to the correlated variability at
   the X-ray and VHE bands without variability at the optical/UV band, as
   well as to shorter timescales for the variability at the X-ray and VHE
   bands with respect to the variability at the other bands.
   Conclusions. Both the one-zone and the two-zone SSC models can describe
   the daily SEDs via the variation of only four or five model parameters,
   under the hypothesis that the variability is associated mostly with the
   underlying particle population. This shows that the particle
   acceleration and cooling mechanism that produces the radiating particles
   might be the main mechanism responsible for the broadband SED variations
   during the flaring episodes in blazars. The two-zone SSC model provides
   a better agreement with the observed SED at the narrow peaks of the
   low-and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although the
   reported one-zone SSC model could be further improved by varying the
   parameters related to the emitting region itself (delta, B and R), in
   addition to the parameters related to the particle population.}},

Abstract = {{One embodiment of context-dependent sensory processing is bottom-up
   adaptation, where persistent stimuli decrease neuronal firing rate over
   hundreds of milliseconds. Adaptation is not, however, simply the fatigue
   of the sensory pathway, but shapes the information flow and selectivity
   to stimulus features. Adaptation enhances spatial discriminability
   (distinguishing stimulus location) while degrading detectability
   (reporting presence of the stimulus), for both the ideal observer of the
   cortex and awake, behaving animals. However, how the dynamics of the
   adaptation shape the cortical response and this detection and
   discrimination tradeoff is unknown, as is to what degree this phenomenon
   occurs on a continuum as opposed to a switching of processing modes.
   Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in anesthetized rats to capture the
   temporal and spatial characteristics of the cortical response to tactile
   inputs, we showed that the suppression of the cortical response, in both
   magnitude and spatial spread, is continuously modulated by the
   increasing amount of energy in the adapting stimulus, which is
   nonuniquely determined by its frequency and velocity. Single-trial ideal
   observer analysis demonstrated a tradeoff between detectability and
   spatial discriminability up to a moderate amount of adaptation, which
   corresponds to the frequency range in natural whisking. This was
   accompanied by a decrease in both detectability and discriminability
   with high-energy adaptation, which indicates a more complex coupling
   between detection and discrimination than a simple switching of modes.
   Taken together, the results suggest that adaptation operates on a
   continuum and modulates the tradeoff between detectability and
   discriminability that has implications for information processing in
   ethological contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Kilohertz electrical stimulation (KES) has been shown to induce
   repeatable and reversible nerve conduction block in animal models. In
   this study, we characterized the ability of KES stimuli to selectively
   block specific components of stimulated nerve activity using in vivo
   preparations of the rat sciatic and vagus nerves. KES stimuli in the
   frequency range of 5-70 kHz and amplitudes of 0.1-3.0 mA were applied.
   Compound action potentials were evoked using either electrical or
   sensory stimulation, and block of components was assessed through direct
   nerve recordings and muscle force measurements. Distinct observable
   components of the compound action potential had unique conduction block
   thresholds as a function of frequency of KES. The fast component, which
   includes motor activity, had a monotonically increasing block threshold
   as a function of the KES frequency. The slow component, which includes
   sensory activity, showed a nonmonotonic block threshold relationship
   with increasing KES frequency. The distinct trends with frequency of the
   two components enabled selective block of one component with an
   appropriate choice of frequency and amplitude. These trends in threshold
   of the two components were similar when studying electrical stimulation
   and responses of the sciatic nerve, electrical stimulation and responses
   of the vagus nerve, and sensorimotor stimulation and responses of the
   sciatic nerve. This differential blocking effect of KES on specific
   fibers can extend the applications of KES conduction block to selective
   block and stimulation of neural signals for neuromodulation as well as
   selective control of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor function.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis was conducted to investigate the inlet buzz and
   combustion oscillation in an axisymmetric ramjet engine with wedge-type
   flame holders. The physical model of concern includes the entire engine
   flow path, extending from the leading edge of the inlet center-body
   through the exhaust nozzle. The theoretical formulation is based on the
   Farve-averaged conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, and
   species concentration, and accommodates finite-rate chemical kinetics
   and variable thermo-physical properties. Turbulence closure is achieved
   using a combined scheme comprising of a low-Reynolds number k-epsilon
   two-equation model and Sarkar's compressible turbulence model. Detailed
   flow phenomena such as inlet flow aerodynamics, flame evolution, and
   acoustic excitation as well as their interactions, are investigated.
   Mechanisms responsible for driving the inlet buzz are identified and
   quantified for the engine operating at subcritical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Lag-averaged Lagrangian statistics from direct numerical simulations
   over a range of Reynolds numbers are analyzed to test the predictions of
   the Lagrangian Refined Similarity Hypothesis (LRSH). The analysis uses
   the Lagrangian integral time scale to scale the lag since it is the
   natural time scale to reveal trends and scaling with Reynolds number.
   Both the velocity difference and the dissipation rate probability
   density functions (PDFs) collapse across inertial sub-range and
   diffusive scales for approximately the same values of the scaled lag,
   and in the zero lag limit are independent of the lag and depend only on
   the Reynolds number. These findings are consistent with the LRSH. The
   velocity difference PDFs are characterized by stretched exponential
   tails, while the dissipation rate PDFs for small lags have a log normal
   core with power law tails at both large and small values of the
   dissipation rate. The velocity structure functions show inertial
   sub-range similarity scaling with Reynolds number which extends to
   smaller scales with increasing Reynolds number. Estimates of the scaling
   exponents obtained are consistent with those from previous studies. They
   tend to saturate at a value of about two for high order moments.
   Non-dimensional acceleration moments show a striking power law
   dependence on Reynolds number from which novel estimates of the scaling
   exponents have been determined. Similarity scaling is much more elusive
   to demonstrate in the dissipation rate moments. The data are consistent
   with, but do not confirm, the Oboukhov relationship connecting velocity
   structure functions and dissipation rate moments on inertial sub-range
   scales. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},
