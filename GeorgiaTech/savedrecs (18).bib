Abstract = {{Heterogeneous networking is a promising solution for improving wireless
   coverage, relieving overcrowded bandwidth, and enhancing system
   throughput for next-generation wireless networks. However, one of the
   main concerns to put through heterogeneous networks is the interference
   among overlaid cells. In this paper, we consider femtocell uplink
   transmissions with dynamic and short-period interference (also called
   shot interference) from macrocell users. It is shown that, without the
   information on interferer channels between femtocells and macrocells at
   any base station, femtocell networks suffer from severe performance
   degradation when they adopt orthogonal frequency-division multiple
   access (OFDMA) or single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) techniques. To mitigate
   the stringent shot interference, we propose a precoded FDMA (P-FDMA)
   transmission with novel detectors. Our results show that the proposed
   designs collect multipath diversity in the presence of interference
   without the knowledge of interferer channels, and our designs are robust
   to the power levels of shot interference. Simulation results validate
   our theoretical findings.}},

Title = {{An uncertainty quantification method for nanomaterial prediction models}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for quantifying uncertainty in the
   predictions of a nanomaterial computational model to account for
   variability in the constituent nanostructure properties and
   characterization measurements. The stiffness of a buckypaper-polymer
   composite is predicted using a micromechanics model. The model requires
   from the user as inputs the nanostructure properties, including the
   diameter, length, and curvature distribution of the carbon nanotubes
   which shows large variability. The current characterization techniques
   used to describe these dimensions are subject to considerable
   measurement error. We propose a constrained nonlinear programming
   approach for quantification of raw material variability and its impact
   on the property prediction of buckypaper-polymer composites. The
   uncertainty quantification method is useful for decision making to
   predict probability that the quality characteristic of the final part
   will satisfy design constraints. A case study based on data from a real
   buckypaper manufacturing process was used to illustrate the approach. It
   is shown that modeling the correlation between nanostructure properties
   using a multivariate distribution rather than independent univariate
   distributions is important to accurately quantify the effect of these
   properties on the final-part property.}},

Title = {{Comparing Counterpoise-Corrected, Uncorrected, and Averaged Binding
   Energies for Benchmarking Noncovalent Interactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{High-quality benchmark computations are critical for the development and
   assessment of approximate methods to describe noncovalent interactions.
   Recent advances in the treatment of dispersion by density functional
   theory and also the development of more efficient wave function
   techniques to reliably address noncovalent interactions motivate new
   benchmark computations of increasing accuracy. This work considers focal
   point approximations to estimate the complete basis set limit of
   coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triples {[}CCSD(T)/CBS] and
   evaluates how this approach is affected by the use or absence of
   counterpoise (CP) correction or, as has recently gained traction, the
   average of those values. Current benchmark protocols for interaction
   energies are computed with all CP procedures and assessed against the
   A24 and S22B databases and also to highly converged results for formic
   acid, cyanogen, and benzene dimers. Whether CP correction, no
   correction, or the average is favored depends upon the theoretical
   method, basis set, and binding motif. In recent high-quality benchmark
   studies, interaction energies often use second-order perturbation theory
   with extrapolated aug-cc-pVTZ (aTZ) and aug-cc-pVQZ (aQZ) basis sets
   {[}MP2/aTQZ] combined with a ``coupled-cluster correction,{''}
   delta(CCSD(T))(MP2), evaluated in an aug-cc-pVDZ basis. For such an
   approach, averaging CP-corrected and uncorrected values for the MP2
   component and using CP-corrected delta(CCSD(T))(MP2) values offers
   errors more balanced among binding motifs and generally more favorable
   overall. Other combinations of counterpoise correction are not quite as
   accurate. When employing MP2/aQ5Z extrapolations and an aTZ basis for
   delta(CCSD(T))(MP2), using CP-corrected or averaged MP2 estimates are
   about equally effective (and slightly superior to uncorrected MP2
   values), but the counterpoise treatment of delta(CCSD(T))(MP2) makes
   little difference. Focal point estimates at this level achieve benchmark
   quality results otherwise accessible only with CCSD(T)/aQZ or better.}},

Abstract = {{The albedo of the Greenland ice sheet plays a key role in the energy
   balance and climate of the arctic. Change in snow albedo values
   associated with changing climate conditions can be monitored remotely
   from satellite platforms viewing the entire Greenland ice sheet, yet
   comparisons to high quality surface measurements are necessary to assess
   the accuracy of satellite measurements as new snow albedo algorithms are
   developed with higher spatial and temporal resolution.
   During May, June, and July 2011, we obtained daily measurements of
   spectral albedo at Summit, Greenland with an Analytical Spectral Devices
   (ASD) spectroradiometer, scanning at 350-2200 nm. We compare our
   spectral albedo field measurements to the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectrometer (MODIS), using both the Version 005 Direct Broadcast daily
   albedo product and the recently developed Version 006 MCD43A daily
   albedo product. The spectral field measurements allow calculation of
   weighted integrals to compare to seven MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging
   the UV through Infrared, as well as a broadband integration to compare
   to the MODIS shortwave albedo. We additionally compare our field
   measurements to albedo measured at the Baseline Surface Radiation
   Network (BSRN) station at Summit.
   Using the MODIS Version 005 Direct Broadcast product, high-quality
   retrievals only, comparison to field measurements results in root mean
   square error (RMSE) of 0.033 for the MODIS shortwave product, and RMSE
   for the MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging 0.022-0.077. The new MODIS
   Version 006 product shows considerable improvement, with shortwave RMSE
   of 0.026, and narrow bandwidths ranging 0.020-0.048. These error values
   for the Version 006 albedo product show an improvement in reported error
   values from previous MODIS field validations in Greenland, which have
   been limited to broadband data from the Greenland Climate Network
   Automatic Weather Stations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant elastin-like protein polymers are increasingly being
   investigated as component materials of a variety of implantable medical
   devices. This is chiefly a result of their favorable biological
   properties and the ability to tailor their physical and mechanical
   properties. In this report, we explore the potential of modulating the
   water content, mechanical properties, and drug release profiles of
   protein films through the selection of different crosslinking schemes
   and processing strategies. We find that the selection of crosslinking
   scheme and processing strategy has a significant influence on all
   aspects of protein polymer films. Significantly, utilization of a
   confined, fixed volume, as well as vapor-phase crosslinking strategies,
   decreased protein polymer equilibrium water content. Specifically, as
   compared to uncrosslinked protein gels, water content was reduced for
   genipin (15.5\%), glutaraldehyde (GTA, 24.5\%), GTA vapor crosslinking
   (31.6\%), disulfide (SS, 18.2\%) and SS vapor crosslinking (25.5\%) (P <
   0.05). Distinct crosslinking strategies modulated protein polymer
   stiffness, strain at failure and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). In all
   cases, vapor-phase crosslinking produced the stiffest films with the
   highest UTS. Moreover, both confined, fixed volume and vapor-phase
   approaches influenced drug delivery rates, resulting in decreased
   initial drug burst and release rates as compared to solution phase
   crosslinking. Tailored crosslinking strategies provide an important
   option for modulating the physical, mechanical and drug delivery
   properties of protein polymers. (C) 2013 Acts Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{This paper establishes the method of controlled Lagrangian particle
   tracking (CLPT) to analyze the offsets between physical positions of
   marine robots in the ocean and simulated positions of controlled
   particles in an ocean model. The offset, which we term the CLPT error,
   demonstrates distinguished characteristics not previously seen in
   drifters and floats that cannot be actively controlled. The CLPT error
   growth over time is exponential until it reaches a turning point that
   only depends on the resolution of the ocean model. After this turning
   point, the error growth slows down significantly to polynomial functions
   of time. In the ideal case, a theoretical upper threshold on exponential
   growth of CLPT error can be derived. These characteristics are proved
   theoretically, verified via simulation, and justified with ocean
   experimental data. The method of CLPT may be applied to improve the
   accuracy of ocean circulation models and the performance of navigation
   algorithms for marine robots.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates two 94 GHz SPDT quarter-wave shunt switches using
   saturated SiGe HBTs. A new mode of operation, called reverse saturation,

   the substrate. The switches were designed in a 180 nm SiGe BiCMOS
   technology featuring 90 nm SiGe HBTs (selective emitter shrink) with of
   f(T)/f(max) of 250/300+ GHz. The forward-saturated switch achieves an
   insertion loss and isolation at 94 GHz of 1.8 dB and 19.3 dB,
   respectively. The reverse-saturated switch achieves a similar isolation,

Abstract = {{As CMOS technology driven by Moore's law has approached device sizes in
   the range of 5-20 nm, noise immunity of such future technology nodes is
   predicted to decrease considerably, eventually affecting the reliability
   of computations through them. A shift in the design paradigm is expected
   from 100\% accurate computations to probabilistic computing with
   accuracy dependent on the target application or circuit specifications.
   One model developed for CMOS technology that emulates the erroneous
   behavior predicted is termed probabilistic CMOS (PCMOS). In this paper,
   we propose a PCMOS-based architecture implementation for traditional
   motion estimation algorithms and show that up to 57\% energy savings are
   possible for different existing motion estimation algorithms.
   Furthermore, algorithmic modifications are proposed that can enhance the
   energy savings to 70\% with a PCMOS architectural implementation. About
   1.8-5 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio under energy savings
   of 57\% to 70\% for two different motion estimation algorithms is shown,
   establishing the resilience of the proposed algorithm to probabilistic
   computing over the comparable conventional algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A structured ASIC, one kind of programmable logic device (PLD), consists
   of a homogeneous array of programmable logic elements, or called tiles.
   The architecture of each tile is supposed to be very general so that any
   kind of logic can be implemented on it; this is the main reason why a
   structured ASIC has an inherently limited performance, together with a
   large area requirement compared to an ASIC. This balances the little
   mask cost of structured ASIC. We tilt this balance by introducing a
   small number of different types of tile, each with its own architecture,
   which can be deployed across different designs by the use of a simple
   blocking mask. This is made possible by a new photolithography concept
   called selectively patterned masks (SPM), which we propose. We address
   the practical issues of SPM, including mask cost and manufacturing time.
   We introduce the heterogeneous array of programmable logic (HAPL), which
   is a new structured ASIC which takes advantage of SPM. HAPL has its own
   tile and routing architectures, and supporting CAD tools for packing and
   routing. Extensive experiments in 45-nm technology are used to assess
   HAPL and compare it with ASIC. A HAPL design that is optimized for area
   is about twice the size of its ASIC counterpart. A delay-optimized HAPL
   design exhibits a post-layout delay which is, on average, 1.35 that of
   an equivalent ASIC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a round-robin approach for multi-source

   matrix. This projection matrix effectively minimizes mean-square energy
   near current source location estimates subject to a rank constraint that
   prevents excessive interference with sources outside of these
   neighborhoods. Numerical simulations are presented for multiple sources
   transmitting through a fixed (and presumed known) generic Pekeris ocean
   waveguide in the single-frequency and broadband-coherent cases that
   illustrate the performance of the proposed approach which compares
   favorably against other previously published approaches. Furthermore,

Abstract = {{Many natural materials possess unique and aesthetic microstructures
   following a long-term evolutionary process. In this study, we succeeded
   in utilizing these microstructures, i.e., using natural silk fibers as a
   template to produce biomorphic Al2O3 fibers. Silk fibers were first
   immersed in an AlCl3 solution and then sintered in air at high
   temperatures to produce the final Al2O3 fibers. Their microstructures
   and thermal conductivity were then analyzed. The results showed that
   these synthesized fibers retained the original morphologies of silk.
   These Al2O3 fibers were hollow and hence possessed better
   heat-insulating properties than did Al2O3 fibers prepared by traditional
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{The piezo-phototronic effect, a three way coupling effect of
   piezoelectric, semiconductor and photonic properties in non-central
   symmetric semiconductor materials, utilizing the piezo-potential as a
   ``gate'' voltage to tune the charge transport/generation/recombination
   and modulate the performance of optoelectronic devices, has formed a new
   field and attracted lots of interest recently. The mechanism was
   verified in various optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes
   (LEDs), photodetectors and solar cells etc. The fast development and
   dramatic increasing interest in the piezo-phototronic field not only
   demonstrate the way the piezo-phototronic effects work, but also
   indicate the strong need for further research in the physical mechanism
   and potential applications. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish
   the contribution of the piezo-phototronic effect from other factors
   induced by external strain such as piezoresistance, band shifting or
   contact area change, which also affect the carrier behaviour and device
   performance. In this perspective, we review our recent progress on
   piezo-phototronics and especially focus on pointing out the features of
   piezo-phototronic effect in four aspects: I-V characteristics; c-axis
   orientation; influence of illumination; and modulation of carrier
   behaviour. Finally we proposed several criteria for describing the
   contribution made by the piezo-phototronic effect to the performance of
   optoelectronic devices. This systematic analysis and comparison will not
   only help give an in-depth understanding of the piezo-phototronic
   effect, but also work as guide for the design of devices in related
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of a prototypical phosphonic acid from an ethanol
   solution onto indium-tin oxide is studied using XPS to assess the
   chemisorption kinetics and the purity of the film deposited, and UPS is
   employed to determine the electronic structure changes induced by the
   modifier. Room temperature (r.t.) vs. 75 degrees C depositions are
   compared, as well as the effect of using air plasma (AP) pretreatment
   vs. utilizing only detergent-solvent cleaning (DSC) prior to immersion.
   It is concluded that the order of adsorption kinetics and film purity
   follows the trend AP 75 degrees C > DSC 75 degrees C > AP r.t. > DSC
   r.t., while the work function obtained for each immersion time depends
   on whether the substrate is plasma pretreated or not and on the
   molecular dipole, which saturates at high coverages.}},

Abstract = {{An earlier work of ours has proposed a novel approach for the deployment
   of the maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy for complex
   resource allocation systems (RAS), that is based on the identification
   and the efficient storage of a critical subset of states of the
   underlying RAS state space; the availability of this information enables
   an expedient one-step-lookahead scheme for the identification and
   blockage of transitions that will take the system behavior outside its
   safe region. This paper complements the aforementioned results by
   introducing a novel algorithm that provides those critical states while
   avoiding the complete enumeration of the RAS state space.
   Note to Practitioners-The establishment of deadlock-free resource
   allocation is a prominent problem that underlies the behavioral dynamics
   of many contemporary applications of automation science and engineering.
   Ideally, one would like to establish the aforementioned deadlock freedom
   while imposing the minimum possible restriction to the underlying
   resource allocation function. The results presented in this paper
   facilitate the deployment of such minimally restrictive solutions to the
   deadlock avoidance problem for applications of practical size and
   behavioral complexity.}},

Abstract = {{To keep up with increasing modeling complexity arising from 3-D
   integration, novel thermal modeling methods are required to tackle
   large-scale 3-D systems. In this paper, we propose a system-level
   thermal modeling method using nonconformal domain decomposition and
   Krylov space-based model-order reduction (MOR) for both steady-state and
   transient analysis. To efficiently model a 3-D system, the system is
   divided into separate domains with independent meshing grids using
   nonconformal domain decomposition. As a result, reduced-order models can
   be created for individual domains with MOR ports, which can reduce the
   computational challenge of performing MOR for the entire system with a
   large number of unknowns and ports. The connectivity between domains is
   captured using coupling matrices via Lagrange multipliers and Schur
   complements. In addition, the proposed method can efficiently handle
   varying design parameters, such as air convection coefficient and
   thermal conductivity without performing parameterized MOR. The modeling
   results show that the proposed method can efficiently simulate 3-D
   systems with hundreds of ports with a speed-up of 20x, compared with
   just thermal modeling using domain decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{3-D integration using through-silicon-vias (TSVs) is emerging as one of
   the key technology options for continued miniaturization. However,
   because of increased device and current density, the reliability of the
   3-D power grid and its integrity must be studied and analyzed. Due to
   the geometry of TSVs and connections to the global power grid,
   significant current crowding can occur. Current densities at these
   connections can be much higher than the expected average values, so
   extra care is required for accurate analysis. In prior work, TSVs are
   modeled as single resistors along with power grid wire segments. Such
   models do not capture detailed current density distribution and may miss
   hotspots associated with current crowding. This paper studies current
   crowding and its impact on 3-D power grid integrity. First, we explore
   the current density distribution within a TSV and its connections to the
   global chip power grid. Second, we implement simple TSV models to obtain
   current density distributions within a TSV and its local environment.
   These models are checked for accuracy by comparing with models simulated
   using finite element modeling methods. Finally, the simple TSV models
   are integrated with the global power grid for detailed chip-scale power
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, for the first time, presents successful integration of a W
   -band antenna with an organically flip-chip packaged silicon-germanium
   (SiGe) low-noise amplifier (LNA). The successful integration requires an
   optimized flip-chip interconnect. The interconnect performance was
   optimized by modeling and characterizing the flip-chip transition on a
   low-loss liquid crystal polymer organic substrate. When the loss of
   coplanar waveguide (CPW) lines is included, an insertion loss of 0.6 dB
   per flip-chip-interconnect is measured. If the loss of CPW lines is
   de-embedded, 0.25 dB of insertion loss is observed. This kind of
   low-loss flip-chip interconnect is essential for good performance of W
   -band modules. The module, which we present in this paper, consists of
   an end-fire Yagi-Uda antenna integrated with an SiGe BiCMOS LNA. The
   module is 3 mm x 1.9 mm and consumes only 19.2 mW of dc power. We
   present passive and active E-and H -plane radiation pattern measurements
   at 87, 90, and 94 GHz. Passive and active antennas both showed a 10-dB
   bandwidth of 10 GHz. The peak gain of passive and active antennas was
   5.2 dBi at 90 GHz and 21.2 dBi at 93 GHz, respectively. The measurements
   match well with the simulated results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to develop a novel method to evaluate Conservation
   Voltage Reduction (CVR) effects. A multistage Support Vector Regression
   (MSVR)-based model is proposed to estimate the load without voltage
   reduction during the CVR period. The first stage is to select a set of
   load profiles that are close to the profile under estimation by a
   Euclidian distance-based index; the second stage is to train the SVR
   prediction model using the pre-selected profiles; the third stage is to
   re-select the estimated profiles to minimize the impacts of estimation
   errors on CVR factor calculation. Compared with previous efforts to
   analyze the CVR outcome, this MSVR-based technique does not depend on
   selections of control groups or assumptions of any linear relationship
   between the load and its impact factors. In order to deal with the
   variability of CVR performances, a stochastic framework is proposed to
   assist utilities in selecting target feeders. The proposed method has
   been applied to evaluate CVR effects of practical voltage reduction
   tests and shown to be accurate and effective.}},

Abstract = {{Vaporization of two liquid oxygen (LOX) droplets in tandem in
   supercritical convective hydrogen environments has been numerically
   investigated. The theoretical formulation consists of a complete set of
   conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species
   concentrations. The solution technique is based on a unified treatment
   of general fluid thermodynamics incorporated into a dual time-stepping
   preconditioning approach. In addition, a self-consistent property
   evaluation method is implemented to calculate strong property variations
   in the transcritical and supercritical fluid regimes. The flow
   conditions cover a range of pressures between 100 and 400 atm and
   freestream velocities from 2.5 to 20 m/s. Special attention is given to
   the effect of droplet interaction on the droplet dynamics and
   vaporization characteristics. Results indicate that the vaporization
   behaviors of the two interacting droplets are different from those of an
   isolated droplet. The presence of the trailing droplet has a minor
   effect on the lifetime and trajectory of the leading droplet. In
   contrast, the lifetime of the trailing droplet is substantially
   prolonged and its moving trajectory is strongly altered. At an ambient
   pressure of 100 atm, a forward bag-type break-up of the leading droplet
   is observed when the two droplets are placed closely, with the HIR (the
   initial droplet spacing to the droplet radius) ratio less than 4. Under
   the same operating conditions, forward movement takes place for the
   trailing droplet. Increasing ambient pressure weakens droplet
   interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ceramic ultrafiltration membranes has drawn increasing attention in
   drinking water treatment sectors as an alternative to traditional
   polymeric counterparts, yet only limited information has been made
   available about the characteristics of ceramic membrane fouling by
   natural organic matter. The effects of solution chemistry including
   ionic strength, divalent ion concentration and pH on the flux behavior
   were comparatively evaluated for ceramic and polymeric ultrafiltration
   of synthetic water containing model natural organic matter. Filtration
   characteristics were further probed via resistance-in-series model
   analysis, fouling visualization using quantum dots, batch adsorption
   test, contact angle measurement, solute-membrane surface adhesion force
   measurement, and quantitative comparison of fouling characteristics
   between ceramic and polymeric membranes. The results collectively
   suggested that the effects of solution chemistry on fouling behavior of
   ceramic membranes were generally similar to polymeric counterparts in
   terms of trends, while the extent varied significantly depending on
   water quality parameters. Lower fouling tendency and enhanced cleaning
   efficiency were observed with the ceramic membrane, further promoting
   the potential for ceramic membrane application to surface water

Abstract = {{During standing balance, kinematics of postural behaviors have been
   previously observed to change across visual conditions, perturbation
   amplitudes, or perturbation frequencies. However, experimental
   limitations only allowed for independent investigation of such
   parameters. Here, we adapted a pseudorandom ternary sequence (PRTS)
   perturbation previously used in rotational support-surface perturbations
   (Peterka in J Neurophysiol 88(3):1097-1118, 2002) to a translational
   paradigm, allowing us to concurrently examine the effects of vision,
   perturbation amplitude, and frequency on balance control. Additionally,
   the unpredictable PRTS perturbation eliminated effects of feedforward
   adaptations typical of responses to sinusoidal stimuli. The PRTS
   perturbation contained a wide spectral bandwidth (0.08-3.67 Hz) and was
   scaled to 4 different peak-to-peak amplitudes (3-24 cm). Root mean
   square (RMS) of hip displacement and velocity increased relative to RMS
   ankle displacement and velocity in the absence of vision across all
   subjects, especially at higher perturbation amplitudes. Gain and phase
   lag of center of mass (CoM) sway relative to the perturbation also
   increased with perturbation frequency; phase lag further increased when
   vision was absent. Together, our results suggest that visual input,
   perturbation amplitude, and perturbation frequency can concurrently and
   independently modulate postural strategies during standing balance.
   Moreover, each factor contributes to the difficulty of maintaining
   postural stability; increased difficulty evokes a greater reliance on
   hip motion. Finally, despite high degrees of joint angle variation
   across subjects, CoM measures were relatively similar across subjects,
   suggesting that the CoM is an important controlled variable for balance.}},

   especially vulnerable to external disruptions. Quantifiable approaches
   are lacking and needed to learn nonstationary behaviors of large-scale
   failure and recovery of power distribution. This paper studies such
   nonstationary behaviors in three aspects. First, a novel formulation is
   derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale failure and recovery of
   power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of failure and
   recovery of power distribution are developed as geolocation-based
   multivariate nonstationary GI(t)/G(t)/infinity queues. Third, the
   nonstationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of
   parameters to be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples
   of large-scale disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from
   an operational network is exact on failures and recoveries. The other is
   from Hurricane Sandy, where aggregated data is used for inferring
   failure and recovery processes at one of the impacted areas. Model
   parameters are learned using real data. Two findings emerge as results
   of learning: 1) failure rates behave similarly at the two different
   provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the
   geographical regions and 2) both the rapid and slow-recovery are present
   for Hurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional
   distribution network from Hurricane Sandy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an effective optimization scheme for the
   measurement-based load modeling based on the sensitivity analysis of
   composite load model parameters. Each parameter of load model has
   different effects on its dynamic response. Moreover, some parameters are
   insensitive to the change of others. To estimate the dynamic
   interactions between parameters, their sensitivity is analyzed by using
   the eigenvalues of Hessian matrix used in the optimization algorithm.
   Also, the linear dependence between two load model parameters is then
   identified by examining the condition number of Jacobian matrix. With
   this parameter analysis, the performance of optimization process for
   measurement-based composite load modeling is improved by reducing the
   number of necessary parameters to consider. The performance of proposed
   method is verified with the practical data measured at a feeder in a
   real substation.}},

Abstract = {{The long-time behavior of a perturbation to a uniform wavetrain of the

   long-time dynamics is characterized by interacting breathers, homoclinic
   orbits to an unstable wavetrain. The associated Benjamin-Feir index is a
   decreasing function of mu, and it vanishes at mu(1). Above this
   threshold, the perturbation dynamics is of defocusing type and breathers
   are suppressed. Thus, homoclinic orbits persist only for small values of
   wave steepness mu a parts per thousand(a) mu(1), in agreement with
   recent experimental and numerical observations of breathers.}},

Abstract = {{Failure by fracture is a serious problem with multilayer ceramic
   capacitors (MLCCs), and the interior electrodes are known to strengthen
   MLCCs. Historically, it has been assumed that the dominant strengthening
   mechanism is crack tip shielding via direct crack tip-electrode
   interactions. However, we have found that residual stresses arising from
   differential thermal contraction after device sintering are actually
   responsible for the observed increase in strength. In addition, the
   fracture initiation sites in MLCCs are located outside of the electrode
   array, so the established idea that the electrical and mechanical
   failure controlling flaw populations are one and the same cannot be
   true. Weibull distributions were compared from the bending fracture of
   two populations of MLCCs with barium titanate (X7R) dielectric, nickel
   electrodes, and the same exterior geometries (but different electrode
   array configurations). MLCCs had characteristic strengths of 236 MPa
   versus a strength of 190 MPa for 19- and 3-electrode MLCCs,
   respectively. Fractography, a critical flaw size computation, an
   analytical residual stress approximation, and in situ electrical
   measurements taken during bending were also used to examine the fracture
   process and demonstrate that residual stress and not crack tip shielding
   is an important strengthening mechanism in MLCCs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the effects of intracellular force on human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells. We generated intracellular force on
   endothelial cells under different magnetic fields using the cell uptake
   of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Cell responses to
   intracellular force were observed using fluorescent microscopy. Our
   results indicated that nanoparticles were taken up by the cell by
   endocytosis and were deposited in lysosomes. Nanoparticles and lysosomes
   inside the cell could be relocated by the application of a magnetic
   force. The intracellular magnetic force could also be used to accelerate
   cell migration by adjusting the magnetic fields and giving the cell free
   culture space. No cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was found in our
   experiments. By comparing intracellular relocalization with migration of
   the whole cell, we obtained a better understanding of the self-defence
   mechanisms of cells based on their mechanical properties. Based on the
   promising mechanical properties and low cytotoxicity of our magnetic
   nanoparticles, their potential applications in cytomechanics and cell
   patterning are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf vein density (LVD) has garnered considerable attention of late,
   with numerous studies linking it to the physiology, ecology, and
   evolution of land plants. Despite this increased attention, little
   consideration has been given to the effects of measurement methods on
   estimation of LVD. Here, we focus on the relationship between
   measurement methods and estimates of LVD. We examine the dependence of
   LVD on magnification, field of view (FOV), and image resolution. We
   first show that estimates of LVD increase with increasing image
   magnification and resolution. We then demonstrate that estimates of LVD
   are higher with higher variance at small FOV, approaching asymptotic
   values as the FOV increases. We demonstrate that these effects arise due
   to three primary factors: (1) the tradeoff between FOV and
   magnification; (2) geometric effects of lattices at small scales; and;
   (3) the hierarchical nature of leaf vein networks. Our results help to
   explain differences in previously published studies and highlight the
   importance of using consistent magnification and scale, when possible,
   when comparing LVD and other quantitative measures of venation structure
   across leaves.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration signal is an important prerequisite for mechanical fault
   detection. However, early stage defect of rotating machineries is
   difficult to identify because their incipient energy is interfered with
   background noises. Multiwavelet is a powerful tool used to conduct
   non-stationary fault feature extraction. However, the existing
   predetermined multiwavelet bases are independent of the dynamic response
   signals. In this paper, a constructing technique of vibration
   data-driven maximal-overlap adaptive multiwavelet (MOAMW) is proposed
   for enhancing the extracting performance of fault symptom. It is able to
   derive an optimal multiwavelet basis that best matches the critical
   non-stationary and transient fault signatures via genetic algorithm. In
   this technique, two-scale similarity transform (TST) and symmetric
   lifting (SymLift) scheme are combined to gain high designing freedom for
   matching the critical faulty vibration contents in vibration signals
   based on the maximal fitness objective. TST and SymLift can add
   modifications to the initial multiwavelet by changing the approximation
   order and vanishing moment of multiwavelet, respectively. Moreover, the
   beneficial feature of the MOAWM lies in that the maximal-overlap
   filterbank structure can enhance the periodic and transient
   characteristics of the sensor signals and preserve the time and
   frequency analyzing resolution during the decomposition process. The
   effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated via a numerical
   simulation as well as a rolling element bearing with an outer race
   scrape and a gearbox with rub fault.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider lattice systems coupled by local interactions.
   We prove invariant manifold theorems for whiskered tori (we recall that
   whiskered tori are quasi-periodic solutions with exponentially
   contracting and expanding directions in the linearized system). The
   invariant manifolds we construct generalize the usual (strong)
   (un)stable manifolds and allow us to consider also non-resonant
   manifolds. We show that if the whiskered tori are localized near a
   collection of specific sites, then so are the invariant manifolds. We
   recall that the existence of localized whiskered tori has recently been
   proven for symplectic maps and flows in Fontich et al. (J Diff Equ,
   2012), but our results do not need that the systems are symplectic. For
   simplicity we will present first the main results for maps, but we will
   show that the result for maps imply the results for flows. It is also
   true that the results for flows can be proved directly following the
   same ideas.}},

Abstract = {{Many enzymes are efficiently produced by microbes. However, the use of
   natural enzymes as biocatalysts has limitations such as low catalytic
   efficiency, low activity, and low stability, especially under industrial
   conditions. Many protein engineering technologies have been developed to
   modify natural enzymes and eliminate these limitations. Commonly used
   protein engineering strategies include directed evolution, site-directed
   mutagenesis, truncation, and terminal fusion. This review summarizes
   recent advances in the molecular engineering of industrial enzymes and
   discusses future prospects in this field. We expect this review to
   increase interest in and advance the molecular engineering of industrial
   enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider block-decomposition first-order methods for
   solving large-scale conic semidefinite programming problems given in
   standard form. Several ingredients are introduced to speed-up the method
   in its pure form such as: an aggressive choice of stepsize for
   performing the extragradient step; use of scaled inner products; dynamic
   update of the scaled inner product for properly balancing the primal and
   dual relative residuals; and proper choices of the initial primal and
   dual iterates, as well as the initial parameter for the scaled inner
   product. Finally, we present computational results showing that our
   method outperforms the two most competitive codes for large-scale conic
   semidefinite programs, namely: the boundary-point method introduced by
   Povh et al. and the Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method by Zhao et al.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anions on the particle size, phase impurity, crystal
   structural, and crystal growth orientation of olivine LiMnPO4 prepared
   via the solvothermal synthesis method are systematically studied.
   LiMnPO4 cannot be obtained for the precursor containing NO3- anions due
   to its strong oxidizing ability in acid environment. The SO42- anion may
   facilitate the growth of high-index planes of the LiMnPO4 crystals owing
   to its higher charge number. The Ac- anion with larger volume may have a
   significant atomic-scale template effect, thus the particle size of
   LiMnPO4 is greatly limited and the crystal growth is inclined to the
   equilibrium state. The LiMnPO4 samples, prepared from MnSO4, MnCl2 and
   Mn(Ac)(2), deliver an initial capacity of 145, 129 and 81 mAh g(-1),
   respectively. Among them, the sample synthesized from MnCl2 can maintain
   91\% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles at 2 C, due to its high
   purity and crystal orientation growth with ac planes.}},

Abstract = {{A novel class of amorphous MnO2 nanowires with a worm-like (WL)
   nanostructure was prepared by electrodeposition and a possible formation

   was 2-3 times larger than that of its crystalline cotton-like MnO2

   significantly facilitate the electrochemical performance of MnO2.
   Flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitors assembled with WL-MnO2
   electrodes exhibited a high energy density of 6.3 W h kg(-1). These

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the problem of recovering an image from a
   sequence of distorted versions of it, where the distortion is caused by
   what is commonly referred to as ground-level turbulence. In mathematical
   terms, such distortion can be described as the cumulative effect of a
   blurring kernel and a time-dependent deformation of the image domain. We
   introduce a statistical dynamic model for the generation of turbulence
   based on linear dynamical systems (LDS). We expand the model to include
   the unknown image as part of the unobserved state and apply Kalman
   filtering to estimate such state. This operation yields a blurry image
   where the blurring kernel is effectively isoplanatic. Applying blind
   nonlocal Total Variation (NL-TV) deconvolution yields a sharp final
   result.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the spectral radiative properties of inclined
   parallel-plate arrays with emphasis on the effect of magnetic
   polaritons. The rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) is employed and
   the geometry of parallel-plate arrays is reproduced by considering the
   structure as a multilayered grating with lateral shift. Enhanced
   absorption at specific wavelengths with angular independence due to the
   excitation of magnetic resonances is demonstrated with the numerical
   calculation. The magnetic resonance condition can be simply predicted by
   a modified capacitor-inductor (LC) model, and electromagnetic field
   distributions are presented to illustrate the unique behavior of
   magnetic polaritons such as field localization and induced currents. The
   agreement between the RCWA and LC model on the resonance conditions
   confirms the excitation of magnetic polaritons. A parametric study is
   conducted to investigate the geometric effects on the radiative
   properties. It is shown that the resonance wavelengths of magnetic
   polaritons can be tuned by changing the plate length, thickness, period,
   or inclination angle. The understanding gained from this study may
   benefit the design of energy harvesting devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Highly-sensitive, reliable and reproducible Raman-active substrates via
   a facile and organic-free method are reported. These intriguing
   hierarchical structures are formed through the uniform incorporation of
   silver (Ag) nanoflowers with aluminium (Al) micro-supporters. The
   underlying mechanism is systematically investigated, visualizing that
   the solvents used in galvanic displacement have a major effect on
   diversifying the reaction kinetics of Ag deposition. Moreover, the
   exploration of AgNO3 concentrations reveals a drastic transition of Ag
   morphologies, driven by the elimination of high-energy surfaces of Ag.
   In addition, the surface-modified Al@Ag structures with
   octadecyltrichlorosilane demonstrate both the non-wetting (contact angle
   = 157.2 degrees), as well as easy droplet roll-off (contact angle
   hysteresis = 5.4 degrees) characteristics, which further enables the
   tested targets to avoid being pinned at a static position upon
   detection. Finally, we find that the Ag nanoflower surfaces are
   corrugated with numerous nanogaps at interparticle sites, in such a way
   that allows the abundant active sites (referred to as ``hot spots{''})
   to amplify the Raman signal, and simultaneously maintain the sound
   reliability and reproducibility of Raman detection. These designs along
   with the fabrication strategy are anticipated to benefit versatile
   optical, optoelectronic and energy devices.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity measurements from resting state blood-oxygen
   level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are
   proving a powerful tool to probe both normal brain function and
   neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the neural mechanisms that
   coordinate these large networks are poorly understood, particularly in
   the context of the growing interest in network dynamics. Recent work in
   anesthetized rats has shown that the spontaneous BOLD fluctuations are
   tightly linked to infraslow local field potentials (LFPs) that are
   seldom recorded but comparable in frequency to the slow BOLD
   fluctuations. These findings support the hypothesis that long-range
   coordination involves low frequency neural oscillations and establishes
   infraslow LFPs as an excellent candidate for probing the neural
   underpinnings of the BOLD spatiotemporal patterns observed in both rats
   and humans. To further examine the link between large-scale network
   dynamics and infraslow LFPs, simultaneous fMRI and microelectrode
   recording were performed in anesthetized rats. Using an optimized filter
   to isolate shared components of the signals, we found that time-lagged
   correlation between infraslow LFPs and BOLD is comparable in spatial
   extent and timing to a quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) found from BOLD
   alone, suggesting that fMRI-measured QPPs and the infraslow LFPs share a
   common mechanism. As fMRI allows spatial resolution and whole brain
   coverage not available with electroencephalography, QPPs can be used to
   better understand the role of infraslow oscillations in normal brain
   function and neurological or psychiatric disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Under the synergistic promotion of chemical reactions, MnO2 microspheres
   are successfully prepared using MnCO3 precursor as self-template, with
   maximum use of the raw materials, and are then converted into spinel
   LiMn2O4 microspheres via a solid-state reaction. When applied as cathode
   materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the LiMn2O4
   microspheres deliver a discharge capacity of 133.2 mA h g(-1) and 109.8
   mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 10 C rates, respectively. More than 91.3\% of
   the initial storage capacity is maintained after 1000 cycles at a 1 C
   charge and 10 C discharge rate. Furthermore, even when cycled at
   elevated temperature (55 degrees C) at a 1 C charge and 10 C discharge
   rate, this material showes 86.2\% capacity retention after 100 cycles,
   which reveals a high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and
   excellent cycling stability under high rates both at room temperature
   and high temperature. The performance is comparable to the best results
   shown in the literature so far. This structured LiMn2O4 microspheres in
   the present work are very promising for large-scale commercialization of
   high-power lithium ion batteries.}},

Title = {{Meniscus formation in a capillary and the role of contact line friction}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{609-615}},
Abstract = {{We studied spontaneous formation of an internal meniscus by dipping
   glass capillaries of 25 mm to 350 mm radii into low volatile hexadecane
   and tributyl phosphate. X-ray phase contrast and high speed optical
   microscopy imaging were employed. We showed that the meniscus completes
   its formation when the liquid column is still shorter than the capillary
   radius. After that, the meniscus travels about ten capillary radii at a
   constant velocity. We demonstrated that the experimental observations
   can be explained by introducing a friction force linearly proportional
   to the meniscus velocity with a friction coefficient depending on the
   air/liquid/solid triplet. It was demonstrated that the friction
   coefficient does not depend on the capillary radius. Numerical solution
   of the force balance equation revealed four different uptake regimes
   that can be specified in a phase portrait. This phase portrait was found
   to be in good agreement with the experimental results and can be used as
   a guide for the design of thin porous absorbers.}},

Abstract = {{Critical-sized osteochondral defects are clinically challenging, with
   limited treatment options available. By engineering osteochondral grafts
   using a patient's own cells and osteochondral scaffolds designed to
   facilitate cartilage and bone regeneration, osteochondral defects may be
   treated with less complications and better long-term clinical outcomes.
   Scaffolds can influence the development and structure of the engineered
   tissue, and there is an increased awareness that osteochondral tissue
   engineering concepts need to take the in vivo complexities into account
   in order to increase the likelihood of successful osteochondral tissue
   repair. The developing trend in osteochondral tissue engineering is the
   utilization of multiphasic scaffolds to recapitulate the multiphasic
   nature of the native tissue. Cartilage and bone have different
   structural, mechanical, and biochemical microenvironments. By designing
   osteochondral scaffolds with tissue-specific architecture, it may be
   possible to enhance osteochondral repair within shorter timeframe. While
   there are promising in vivo outcomes using multiphasic approaches,
   functional regeneration of osteochondral constructs still remains a
   challenge. In this review, we provide an overview of in vivo
   osteochondral repair studies that have taken place in the past three
   years, and define areas which needs improvement in future studies. Anat

Abstract = {{Two-scale roughened silicon (Si) textures are considered promising
   architectures for versatile applications because of their excellent
   self-cleaning, light-trapping, and biosensing capacities. In this study,
   we explore the directional control of nanowires formed on pyramidal
   microtextures through a single-step metal-assisted chemical etching
   (MACE). The measured current density of Si dissolution at catalytic
   etching enables quantitative monitoring of the etching kinetics of
   nanowire formation. The preferential orientation of fabricated nanowires
   on \{111\}-plane pyramidal textures was found to positively correlate
   with the molar ratio of {[}AgNO3] to ({[}AgNO3]+{[}HF]), referred to as
   . A distinct transition from <100> to <111> axial directions at 0.2 and
   =0.07, respectively, was revealed. The <111>-oriented nanowires on the
   pyramidal microtextures exhibited an excellent antireflection
   performance, with a reflectivity as low as 1.2\% at 600nm. The results

Title = {{The missing term in the decomposition of finite deformation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{51-76}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In finite inelasticity, the gradient of total deformation is typically
   split into a product of two terms: a reversible (elastic) term whose
   strain vanishes upon load removal at some scale, and an irreversible
   (plastic) component that remains. In this work it is argued that this
   decomposition represents a limiting case for which defects are absent
   from the volume of interest, with compatible elastic distortion
   associated with externally applied stress and plastic deformation
   associated with history of dislocation glide through the element. An
   additional (third) term should be incorporated in the multiplicative
   decomposition when applied to an element of material of any realistic
   volume, accounting for local lattice distortion due to defects within.
   In the limiting case that this volume approaches a few lattice spacings,
   the probability of interior defects tends towards zero, but a very small
   volume element containing a few defects, or a larger element containing
   a large density of defects, requires a third term in the multiplicative
   decomposition to represent contributions of defects to residual lattice
   distortion. Physical experiments and reported atomic and continuum
   calculations support these theoretical arguments. The magnitude of
   distortion from the ``missing{''} third term is estimated analytically
   using elasticity solutions for straight dislocations. Advances to
   crystal plasticity theory involving a three-term decomposition are
   suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) support diverse microbial communities
   with roles in major elemental cycles. It is unclear how the taxonomic
   composition and metabolism of OMZ microorganisms vary between
   particle-associated and free-living size fractions. We used amplicon
   (16S rRNA gene) and shotgun metagenome sequencing to compare microbial
   communities from large (>1.6 mu m) and small (0.2-1.6 mu m) filter size
   fractions along a depth gradient in the OMZ off Chile. Despite steep
   vertical redox gradients, size fraction was a significantly stronger
   predictor of community composition compared to depth. Phylogenetic
   diversity showed contrasting patterns, decreasing towards the anoxic OMZ
   core in the small size fraction, but exhibiting maximal values at these
   depths within the larger size fraction. Fraction-specific distributions
   were evident for key OMZ taxa, including anammox planctomycetes, whose
   coding sequences were enriched up to threefold in the 0.2-1.6 mu m
   community. Functional gene composition also differed between fractions,
   with the >1.6 mu m community significantly enriched in genes mediating
   social interactions, including motility, adhesion, cell-to-cell
   transfer, antibiotic resistance and mobile element activity. Prokaryotic
   transposase genes were three to six fold more abundant in this fraction,
   comprising up to 2\% of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that
   particle surfaces may act as hotbeds for transposition-based genome
   changes in marine microbes. Genes for nitric and nitrous oxide reduction
   were also more abundant (three to seven fold) in the larger size
   fraction, suggesting microniche partitioning of key denitrification
   steps. These results highlight an important role for surface attachment
   in shaping community metabolic potential and genome content in OMZ
   microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical mesh devices composed of synthetic materials are commonly used
   for ventral hernia repair. These materials provide robust mechanical
   strength and are quickly incorporated into host tissue; factors that
   contribute to reduced hernia recurrence rates. However, such mesh
   devices cause a foreign body response with the associated complications
   of fibrosis and patient discomfort. In contrast, surgical mesh devices
   composed of naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) are
   associated with constructive tissue remodeling, but lack the mechanical
   strength of synthetic materials. A method for applying a porcine dermal
   ECM hydrogel coating to a polypropylene mesh is described herein with
   the associated effects upon the host tissue response and biaxial
   mechanical behavior. Uncoated and ECM coated heavy-weight BARD Mesh were
   compared to the light-weight ULTRAPRO and BARD Soft Mesh devices in a
   rat partial thickness abdominal defect overlay model. The ECM coated
   mesh attenuated the pro-inflammatory response compared to all other
   devices, with a reduced cell accumulation and fewer foreign body giant
   cells. The ECM coating degraded by 35 days, and was replaced with loose
   connective tissue compared to the dense collagenous tissue associated
   with the uncoated polypropylene mesh device. Biaxial mechanical
   characterization showed that all of the mesh devices were of similar
   isotropic stiffness. Upon explanation, the light-weight mesh devices
   were more compliant than the coated or uncoated heavy-weight devices.
   This study shows that an ECM coating alters the default host response to
   a polypropylene mesh, but not the mechanical properties in an acute in
   vivo abdominal repair model. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Title = {{Effect of fluid inertia on the dynamics and scaling of neutrally buoyant
   particles in shear flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{738}},
Pages = {{563-590}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The basic dynamics of a prolate spheroidal particle suspended in shear
   flow is studied using lattice Boltzmann simulations. The spheroid motion
   is determined by the particle Reynolds number (Re-p) and Stokes number
   (St), estimating the effects of fluid and particle inertia,
   respectively, compared with viscous forces on the particle. The particle
   Reynolds number is defined by Re-p = 4Ga(2)/nu, where G is the shear
   rate, a is the length of the spheroid major semi-axis and nu is the
   kinematic viscosity. The Stokes number is defined as St = alpha . Re-p,
   where alpha is the solid-to-fluid density ratio. Here, a neutrally
   buoyant prolate spheroidal particle (St = Re-p) of aspect ratio (major
   axis/minor axis) r(p) = 4 is considered. The long-term rotational motion
   for different initial orientations and Re-p is explained by the dominant
   inertial effect on the particle. The transitions between rotational
   states are subsequently studied in detail in terms of nonlinear
   dynamics. Fluid inertia is seen to cause several bifurcations typical
   for a nonlinear system with odd symmetry around a double zero
   eigenvalue. Particle inertia gives rise to centrifugal forces which
   drives the particle to rotate with the symmetry axis in the
   flow-gradient plane (tumbling). At high Re-p, the motion is constrained
   to this planar motion regardless of initial orientation. At a certain
   critical Reynolds number, Re-p = Re-c, a motionless (steady) state is
   created through an infinite-period saddle-node bifurcation and
   consequently the tumbling period near the transition is scaled as
   vertical bar Re-p - Re-c vertical bar(-1/2). Analyses in this paper show
   that if a transition from tumbling to steady state occurs at Re-p =
   Re-c, then any parameter beta (e. g. confinement or particle spacing)
   that influences the value of Re-c, such that Re-p = Re-c as beta =
   beta(c), will lead to a period that scales as vertical bar beta - beta c
   vertical bar(-1/2) and is independent of particle shape or any geometric
   aspect ratio in the flow.}},

Abstract = {{Organic matter is frequently encountered in both naturally occurring and
   engineered particulate media. Charged functional groups in the organic
   matter can lead to cation exchange within the clay interlayer, which
   results in the formation of an organic coating on the clay surfaces and
   alters the interfacial frictional regime in the soil mass. This study
   investigated the triaxial shear frictional behavior of montmorillonite
   particles coated with a controlled organic phase composed of quaternary
   ammonium cations. Through cation exchange, organic cations were loaded
   onto the clay's interlayer exchange sites, with control on the density
   of organic coverage and structure of the organic cation. Results
   demonstrated that increasing the total organic carbon content of the
   clay resulted in increasing frictional resistance regardless of whether
   the increase in carbon content was attributable to increased density of
   organic loading, increased cation size, or increased cation tail length.
   Concentrating organic carbon in one of the quaternary ammonium cation
   branch positions led to measureable gains in strength compared with
   distributing the carbon over all four branch positions. Measured
   critical-state friction angles for the organoclays ranged between 34 and
   61 degrees, whereas all tested organoclays demonstrated peak strength
   coupled with contractive tendencies. The presence of the organic cations
   in the clay interlayer led to alteration of the structure within the
   interlayer and is believed to have combined with forces from
   electrostatic bonding between the organic cation head groups and the
   clay surface, as well as chain entanglement and dewatering, to
   contribute to the increased frictional resistance of the modified
   organoclays.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates reciprocating wire slurry sawing for
   photovoltaic (PV) silicon wafering and compares the resulting wafer
   surface quality and its mechanical strength to that obtained in
   unidirectional wire sawing. It is found that wire reciprocation creates
   two significantly different morphological or cutting zones on the wafer
   surface. The zone width varies with the distance travelled by the wires,
   the cutting location on the wafer surface, and direction of wire motion.
   The size of the morphological zone created during forward motion of the
   wire is larger than that created during its backward motion. The zone
   width is found to decrease along the wire cut direction. In addition,
   there appears to be greater kerf loss and increased surface roughness in
   the forward cutting zone. In general, results suggest a higher material
   removal rate during forward motion of the wire than during backward
   motion. Notwithstanding the surface morphology variations, the fracture
   strengths of reciprocating wire sawn wafers are found to be quite
   similar to that exhibited by wafers produced by unidirectional wire
   sawing. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Paralinguistic cues in children's speech convey the child's affective
   state and can serve as important markers for the early detection of
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this paper, we detect paralinguistic
   events, such as laughter and fussing/crying, along with toddlers' speech
   from the Multi-modal Dyadic Behavior Dataset (MMDB). We use both
   spectral and prosodic acoustic features selected using a combination of
   filter and wrapper based methods. The classification accuracy using a
   support vector machine with a linear kernel for detecting laughter in
   children's speech was 77.87\% and that for fussing/crying was 79.37\%. A
   tertiary classification scheme for detecting laughter, fussing/crying,
   and speech yielded an accuracy of 69.73\%. To test for the
   generalization of the approach for detecting fussing/crying, we used
   recordings from the Strange Situation protocol, which is used to observe
   attachment behavior between an infant and a parent. Using a cross-corpus
   testing set for detecting fussing/crying, we obtained a detection
   accuracy of 71.6\%. These results indicate that the selected acoustic
   features are capable of discriminating children's laughter,
   fussing/crying, and speech and the algorithms generalize well to a
   dataset consisting of paralinguistic cues of a different age group,
   infants (12 18 months of age), gathered in a different context.}},

Abstract = {{Speech recognition systems are either based on parametric approach or
   non-parametric approach. Parametric based systems such as HMMs have been
   the dominant technology for speech recognition in the past decade.
   Despite a lot of advancements and enhancements in the design of these
   systems: key problems such as long term temporal dependence, etc. has
   not yet been solved. Recently due to availability of large amount of
   data and cheap computing resources (processing power and memory)
   non-parametric based approach to solve speech recognition and
   classification task is becoming popular and feasible. The key advantage
   of non-parametric based approach is that all the information from the
   training data is retained as we don't approximate our data with specific
   statistical models resulting in more speaker specific information. In
   this paper we propose a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) phoneme prediction
   scheme using speaker ranking vector. Speaker ranking vector is
   calculated by finding the similarity of the given TEST speaker with the
   Instance Space using k-NN. The results were compared with nearest
   neighbor and k-NN majority voting approach. Our proposed scheme gives a
   better prediction accuracy as compare with nearest neighbor and k-NN
   majority voting scheme. This approach can help speech recognizer to
   customize on the fly for a given talker and customize training data on
   the basis of similarity measure. In this preliminary research we are
   using a small amount of data to train our phoneme prediction classifier
   engine. Performance can be further increase by increasing the training
   data for finding speaker ranking.}},

Abstract = {{Lifting heavy objects poses a unique challenge for humanoid robots and
   more broadly, for any robot which is responsible for maintaining its own
   balance. Configurations that are balanced without supporting a heavy
   object's weight might not be balanced while the object's weight is being

   planning techniques which resolve these issues without relying on real
   time control methods or extensive force/torque sensing. We introduce the
   novel concept of the Virtual Task Dimension (VTD) for motion planners,
   which can handle the transition between balancing constraints. We
   describe the implementation of these techniques and offer suggestions
   for obtaining fast and reliable solutions. We also demonstrate the
   algorithms running on a DRC-Hubo humanoid robot.}},

   emotions of effective social interaction to gestural behaviors on a

Abstract = {{In the rehabilitation field, determining the effectiveness of an
   intervention protocol begins by comparing the individual's movement
   characteristics against a baseline. In most settings, this baseline is
   determined through clinical studies involving a range of patients
   belonging to the same demographic group. Unfortunately, this leads to a
   process that is difficult to repeat for all patient demographics, or all
   movement characteristics, given the demands on clinicians' and patients'
   time for performing such clinical baseline measurement studies. To
   address this issue, we discuss a method that allows clinicians to
   objectively assess an individual's movements and compare the resulting
   outcome kinematic metrics to a kinematic baseline. Instead of collecting
   human patient data, we propose a robotic kinematic model that generates
   a baseline for different kinematic parameters in real-time as a function
   of the state of a given task. We evaluate our methodology on elbow and
   shoulder range of motion (ROM) angles obtained from eleven typically
   developing children. We compare the user's ROM angles to those generated
   by the proposed model, and discuss the potential of the model to be used
   in various intervention protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the desire to mitigate human casualties in emergency
   situations, this paper explores various guidance modalities provided by
   a robotic platform for instructing humans to safely evacuate during an
   emergency. We focus on physical modifications of the robot, which
   enables visual guidance instructions, since auditory guidance
   instructions pose potential problems in a noisy emergency environment.
   Robotic platforms can convey visual guidance instructions through
   motion, static signs, dynamic signs, and gestures using single or
   multiple arms. In this paper, we discuss the different guidance
   modalities instantiated by different physical platform constructs and
   assess the abilities of the platforms to convey information related to
   evacuation. Human-robot interaction studies with 192 participants show
   that participants were able to understand the information conveyed by
   the various robotic constructs in 75.8\% of cases when using dynamic
   signs with multi-arm gestures, as opposed to 18.0\% when using static
   signs for visual guidance. Of interest to note is that dynamic signs had
   equivalent performance to single-arm gestures overall but drastically
   different performances at the two distance levels tested. Based on these
   studies, we conclude that dynamic signs are important for information
   conveyance when the robot is in close proximity to the human but
   multi-arm gestures are necessary when information must be conveyed
   across a greater distance.}},

Abstract = {{Breadth-First Search (BFS) is widely used in real-world applications
   including computational biology, social networks, and electronic design
   automation. The most effective BFS approach has been shown to be a
   combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Such hybrid techniques
   need to identify a switching point which is conventionally found through
   expensive trial-and-error and exhaustive search routines. We present an
   adaptive method based on regression analysis that enables dynamic
   switching at runtime with little overhead. We improve the performance of
   our method by exploiting popular heterogeneous platforms and efficiently
   design the approach for a given architecture. An 155x speedup is
   achieved over the standard top-down approach on GPUs. Our approach is
   the first to combine top-down and bottom-up across different
   architectures. Unlike combination on a single architecture, a mistuned
   switching point may significantly decrease the performance of
   cross-architecture combination. Our adaptive method can predict the
   switching point with high accuracy, leading to an 695x speedup compared
   the worst switching point.}},

Abstract = {{Building ultra large scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) requires very
   low-power and low-cost sensor designs. Backscatter radio is a
   communication scheme that can accommodate for these two constraints, as
   opposed to active radio architectures. For large scale applications,
   backscatter communication range extension is a necessity; for this,
   careful tag design has to be employed, in order to minimize the tag
   information bit-error-rate (BER) at the reader. Conventional backscatter
   radio/RFID load modulators achieve reflection coefficients whose
   magnitude is less than unity; thus, the reflection coefficients'
   difference magnitude-which is directly related to the backscatter
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-is upper bounded by vertical bar Delta Gamma
   vertical bar <= 2. This is a limitation for SNR maximization, and
   alternative system architectures have to be exploited for load
   modulators. In this work, an architecture is presented that overcomes
   this limitation with the use of a low-power reflection amplifier, which
   shows a reflection coefficient greater than unity on its port. The
   amplify-and-reflect system proposed can be utilized to significantly
   increase the SNR of the backscattered signals and the uplink range of RF
   tags.}},

   gap of the SRR with an array of fluids with different permittivities,
   the resonant frequency of the resonator can be tuned over a wide
   bandwidth. Utilizing only 6 mu L of fluid, which is approximately one
   twentieth of a drop of water, a 30\%, or 0.4\%/epsilon(r) change in
   resonant frequency can be achieved which is higher than current
   cleanroom-fabricated microfluidic RF devices in the literature. The high

Abstract = {{Multi-band antennas are increasingly deployed in wireless systems (e.g.,
   cellular base stations) utilizing multiple dissimilar radiators with
   separate feed networks for each band. A major difficulty in such design
   is to control the isolation between bands, and often the elements are
   widely separated in space, for example, by allocating the antennas for
   each frequency band to a separate dielectric layer. Two major challenges
   to overcome then are the increased array size and weight, and the
   complexity in feed design. This paper presents the design of a compact,
   dual-port, printed slot antenna that employs parasitic reactive coupling
   from an inter-digitated capacitor (IDC) embedded in the microstrip feed
   line to provide broadband impedance matching. An overlay film above the
   IDC (such as low-loss graphene thin films) can be incorporated in the
   design for additional tunability of the wide frequency band. Antenna
   losses are minimized by isolating the IDC and the film from the
   radiator. The effects of the IDC and the overlay film's surface
   impedance variation are parametrically examined through simulations, and
   the wide impedance bandwidth (greater than 100\%) is experimentally
   corroborated with and without a graphene overlay film.}},

   pulsed operation with 10 \% duty-cycle and for an input power of 31 dBm,
   the measured output power ranges across this bandwidth from 38dBm to 41

   (NF) of the SE and Diff LNAs are measured to be 4.2 dB and 6.3 dB,
   respectively, at 94 GHz, while dissipating only 8.8 mW SE from a 2.2-V
   supply, which to the authors' best knowledge is the lowest reported
   power consumption for a Si-based W-band SE LNA. The designed LNAs are
   targeted for low-power phased-array radar integrated transceivers for
   active imaging applications. The measured gain at 94 GHz for the
   single-stage SE and Diff LNAs are 10 dB and 12 dB, respectively, and

   property. Furthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for the partial
   strong converse property to hold for memoryless but non-stationary
   symmetric and degraded wiretap channels. Our proof techniques leverage
   the information spectrum method, which allows us to establish a

Abstract = {{Designing engineering systems to minimize their environmental impact is
   a very complex task. Little exists to guide designers in developing
   products that are integrated into users' lives thus reducing the overall
   environmental impact at the system level. A better understanding of user
   behavior will allow this knowledge to be better integrated into more
   complex, system level models. As an initial step, this paper seeks an
   experimental framework to identify important parameters to be measured.
   For many products, the use stage is where most environmental damage
   occurs. The factors that may influence or obstruct a person to behave in
   a pro-environmental way are complicated. It is critical to train our
   future designers on those factors to reduce environmental impact caused
   by engineered systems. This paper reports an experiment that tests
   alternative products to disposable plastic water bottles to answer
   several eco-friendly design questions. The experiment determines whether
   certain eco-friendly products are more successful than others are and
   why this may be the case. This research includes the testing of four
   different products. Student participants receive one product each to use
   for a one-week testing period and then return to complete two
   questionnaires. Surveys measure the success of the product and the level
   of environmental consciousness through various scales. With the
   understanding of various factors influencing the market success of
   environmentally friendly products, a set of guidelines for the design of
   such products can be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Leaders in industry and government call today for the development of
   innovative or entrepreneurial behavior and skills in engineers
   (innovative is defined in this paper as including commercial execution
   and/or entrepreneurial behavior). Defining the critical characteristics
   of an innovative engineer in the different stages of the innovation
   process (or the Framework for Innovative Engineering, or Framework) was
   the goal of a team of 14 engineers, entrepreneurs and engineering
   faculty who participated in two focus group discussions on how
   successful innovative engineers behave during the innovative process.
   The first focus group discussion was held in October 2012 during the NSF
   sponsored Epicenter retreat at Stanford's Sierra Camp. The second focus
   group discussion was sponsored by the NCIIA and was held for two days in
   Atlanta, Georgia at Georgia Tech in June 2013 following the annual ASEE
   meeting,
   The research question discussed at those two meetings was:
   What are the most important characteristics (knowledge, skills or
   attributes) of an innovative engineer in discovering, developing and
   implementing and sustaining an improvement-in, or a new or novel,
   product, process or concept?
   The purpose of this paper is to document and share the processes used
   and the resulting definitions and identification of innovative
   engineering characteristics that were developed during those two
   Framework focus group discussions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, development, testing, and validation of
   an electric drive control system for a multi-motor vehicle with
   independently driven wheels that can be used as a platform to test an
   electric car's differential drive function. Due to the time and budget
   constraints, we designed the electric car with four motors and one
   Servo, in which each motor supplies power to each wheel and the servo
   uses Ackermann steering. Furthermore, the control system consists of
   three components: the Zigbee transmitters, the embedded system, and the
   electric speed controller. The testing prototype showed its potential
   and feasibility, and it demonstrated that it could simplify the
   mechanical layout of future electric cars by connecting the motors
   directly to the wheels and reduce the number of drivetrain components,
   thus improving the overall reliability and efficiency.
   Furthermore, the paper focuses on the systematic design process used by
   the multidisciplinary team in order to accomplish the project as a
   Capstone Senior Design project. The design project was adequately
   partitioned between the students from the two majors (two students from
   Mechanical Engineering and two from Electrical and Computer Engineering)
   to ensure that the entire team could contribute effectively while being
   able to leverage from the expertise of all team members. Based on the
   team's experience and faculty interaction, future guidance on how a
   sustainable model for enabling multidisciplinary Capstone Design
   projects is also suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The final culminating Capstone Design course provides students the
   opportunity to work in teams and apply their knowledge to design, build
   and test prototypes for solving real-world, open-ended design
   challenges. Several research studies have shown both qualitative and
   quantitative advantages for students by working on multidisciplinary
   Capstone Design projects. All schools within various colleges of the
   Institute currently only offer the traditional mono-disciplinary
   Capstone Design course and hence there exists no formal channel for
   students to collaborate and work together on multidisciplinary Capstone
   Design projects.
   In the absence of a common multidisciplinary Capstone Design course, the
   transition from traditional mono-disciplinary Capstone Design course
   raises issues of managing faculty teaching expectations, providing
   administrative support to faculty and student teams and forming
   multidisciplinary functional student teams. In order to assist with
   resolving these issues, an online portal was developed to support the
   implementation of multidisciplinary Capstone Design projects. Faculty
   and student feedback was solicited in order to conceptualize and develop
   the website to support the entire process of student team formation,
   sharing of multidisciplinary project ideas across schools and making
   student-team assignments. This paper presents the design of this web
   portal along with a discussion on the scope for further improvement.}},

Abstract = {{ASEE student membership has grown in recent years, while the
   professional membership has been in decline. It is critical for ASEE and
   its divisions to consider new ways to engage the growing ASEE student
   member population to improve the likelihood of retaining these students
   as future professional members in the society. Previous studies indicate
   that students see ASEE as an avenue for fulfilling their professional
   development needs. A needs analysis of ASEE student members was
   conducted to inform the creation of a student -inclusive ASEE conference
   program. The analysis identified high priority professional development
   needs (e.g., grant \& proposal writing, college teaching, and navigating
   the job market) of student members and possible ways for ASEE to meet
   these needs (e.g., foster student programs, provide student
   opportunities, and build community). The results informed the creation
   of the 2014 Student Division conference program, which is presented in
   this paper to serve as a model for student -inclusive ASEE conference
   programming. Student -inclusive ASEE conference programming may be one
   mechanism to further engage student members and encourage them to
   continue as professional members in the society.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, single coil wireless power transfer (WPT) systems which are
   potential utilized for in-vivo device powering are limited by the total
   available power at the antenna. To overcome this limitation, a
   multi-coil system is presented which can greatly increase the power
   available to the receiver coil by as much as 800\% while still remaining
   within the regulatory limits for total available power from an
   individual antenna. The effects of matching based on coil separation are
   presented which demonstrate the dependence of the self-resonant
   frequency of the WPT system, and a dynamic matching solution is proposed
   which allows for maximum power transfer efficiency independent of coil
   separation or changes in body impedance.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The electrocardiogram (ECG) allows for interpretation of
   the electrical activity of the heart. The information which can be
   derived from the foetal ECG (FECG) goes beyond heart rate and heart rate
   variability. However morphological analysis of the FECG waveform is
   usually not performed in clinical practice.
   Methods: A Bayesian Filtering Framework based on an Extended Kalman
   Filter (EKF) for extracting the FECG from a single abdominal channel is
   described using a training database of 20, one minute maternal-foetal
   mixtures and evaluated on 200, one minute mixtures. (Data was generated
   using the simulator, fecgsyn, used to generate a subset of the signals
   of the Physionet Challenge 2013.) A single pass of the EKF (EKFS) was
   performed to cancel out the maternal ECG (MECG) in order to build an
   average FECG morphology. A dual EKF (EKFD, i. e. where both the MECG and
   FECG cycle morphology were modelled) was then applied to separate the
   three sources present in the signal mixture (noise, MECG and FECG). A
   normalised root mean square error and absolute QT error after EKFS and
   EKFD were calculated.
   Results: An SNR improvement of 1.97 dB after EKFS and 14.14 dB after
   EKFD on the test set were achieved. Median absolute error on QT
   measurement was 17.0 ms for the EKFS and 4.0 ms for the EKFD.
   Conclusion: This work is a proof of concept that the EKFD allows
   accurate beat to beat extraction of the FECG morphology from abdominal
   recordings.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Intensive care unit patients are heavily monitored, and a
   number of clinically relevant parameters are routinely extracted from
   high resolution signals. In particular, heart rate is derived from
   intervals between pulses in pseudo-periodic signals such as the
   electrocardiogram (ECG) or arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms.
   However, poor signal quality and high noise levels can unfortunately
   lead to false localisation of these pulses (or peaks), resulting in
   incorrect estimates of heart rate. The goal of the 2014 Physionet/CinC
   Challenge was to encourage the creation of an intelligent system that
   fused information from different biosignals to create a robust set of
   peak detections.
   Methods: First, a set of peak detectors were evaluated on different
   cardiovascular signals. The detections were then fused using two
   different approaches: the first one was based on a calculated measures
   of signal quality for the ECG and ABP signals and the the second fusion
   technique was based on the regularity of the derived intervals between
   subsequent detections made on ECG, ABP, Stroke Volume and
   Photoplethysmogram signals. These techniques were developed using the
   MGH/MF database and submitted for scoring on the Challenge test-set.
   Conclusion: The best entries for the two approaches obtained an overall
   score of 8 7 : 8 8 \% and 8 7 : 6 6 \%, respectively, in phase III of
   the challenge, which provided the highest official score.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The ECG Bayesian filtering framework has been shown to be
   a promising method to extract the foetal electrocardiogram (FECG) from
   abdominal recordings. This framework requires an estimation of the ECG
   morphology, which is obtained by approximating an average beat with a
   number of Gaussian kernels. This approximation results in a high
   dimensional nonlinear optimization problem (finding ideal positions,
   width and height for these kernels).
   Methods: Proposed methodologies in the literature initialize the
   optimization algorithm using fixed positions for the kernel functions.
   This contribution benchmarks alternative schemes for finding the
   Gaussian parameters, namely an approach based on the stationary wavelet
   transform and random search. The goal is minimizing the normalized mean
   squared error between the average beat and the approximated model, while
   increasing foetal QRS detection accuracy.
   Results: The suggested methods are able to produce improved morphology
   approximations of the averaged beat up 4.05\% (depending on the selected
   method). The proposed method using the stationary wavelet transform
   improves the goodness of the fit, while reducing the computational load.
   However, no immediate improvement on the accuracy of FQRS detections was
   noticed. Such findings render the proposed method a promising tool.
   However, further research should be directed at transferring the
   improved fit to an improvement of FQRS detections.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes, a graphical user interface (GUI) for synthetic
   simulation of maternal-foetal ECG mixtures. The GUI is directly linked
   to the previously introduced fecgsyn ECG model, which was used for
   producing a subset of data of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology
   Challenge 2013. fecgsyngui serves as a tool that facilitates the use of
   the broad capabilities of fecgsyn.
   ECG mixtures can be generated with realistic beat-to-beat variability,
   morphology, amplitude modulation due to respiration and foetal movement.
   The GUI allows the user to visualise and generate a set of realistic
   scenarios to stress test and train separation and detection algorithms.
   Electrodes can be placed on the maternal abdomen using an interactive
   geometric representation. Simulation parameters and generated signals
   can be exported to. mat files for further processing.
   Using the underlying model, noise sources, ectopic beats, and multiple
   foetuses can be added. A series of pathological scenarios for situations
   (described in the original publication) for which data collection is
   problematic in reality, are included. These can be further customised to
   mirror specific pathological situations.}},

Abstract = {{In foetal electrocardiographic monitoring, assessment of foetal QT (FQT)
   in identifying foetal hypoxia has been limited mainly due to the lack of
   available public databases with expert labels. Our proposed platform,
   CrowdLabel, a web-based open-source annotation system, was developed for
   crowdsourcing medical labels from multiple expert and/or non-expert
   annotators. We describe the platform and an example of use; to improve
   FQT estimation by creating reference labels against which automated
   algorithms can be benchmarked. A total of 501, 30s segments were
   extracted from 15 foetal ECG (FECG) recordings from a private database.
   23 volunteers participated in the study and provided a total of 7,307
   FQT annotations, which were aggregated using a probabilistic label
   aggregator (PLA). The best annotator identified by the PLA had a
   standard deviation in the change of FQT annotations of 13.35 ms and
   35.52 ms when labelling FECG with `very good' and `poor' signal quality
   respectively. The PLA does not require any ground truth to identify the
   best annotator or annotations. Annotator accuracy was also shown to be a
   function of objective signal quality measures. The feasibility of the
   CrowdLabel annotation system for ECG crowdsourcing with an unknown
   ground truth, as well as the results of the first experiment conducted
   using such a platform have been demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Edge buffers along with multiple virtual channels have traditionally
   been used to provide deadlock freedom guarantees in on-chip networks.
   The problem with such schemes is their high buffer space requirement
   which consumes significant power and area. In this work, we propose
   bubble sharing flow control to provide deadlock freedom with small,
   shared central buffers, eliminating edge buffers, improving buffer
   utilization, and decreasing router buffer requirements. The key insight
   involves sharing of the flit-size bubbles (free buffers) among cyclic
   network paths via central buffers in the router, reducing the overall
   router buffering space requirement. This technique effectively
   reconciles the trade-off between high radix and buffer space,
   encouraging the use of low hop count, high-radix topologies, with both
   deterministic and adaptive routing. Comparisons show improvement in
   average packet latency by 31\% as compared to traditional 2VC edge
   buffer routers with 33\% reduction in area for an 8x8 generalized
   hypercube topology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the optimal static and the dynamic anti-windup
   compensators (AWC) are designed using a new improved particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm. The existing optimization techniques for
   AWC make use of LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) and various concepts of
   nonlinear control concepts that require complex mathematics. For this
   optimization, we have developed and utilized an improved version of PSO.
   In this new improved PSO algorithm, first the problem space is explored
   with constant non-zero inertia factor until the fitness function
   saturates to a local or global minima. The solution obtained thus far is
   then further refined by rerunning the algorithm but with inertia factor
   set to zero. This slight improvement enables a better search for a
   solution within the already explored problem-space. The optimized static
   and dynamic AWC is compared with the existing LMI-based AWC for the
   performance index, and it is observed that the improved PSO-based AWC
   gave better results and optimized value of the performance index.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of sensor networks, robots, autonomous vehicles and the smart
   grid have made the dependability of circuits and systems that control
   them critical to society and national defense. While significant
   advances in the design of linear and nonlinear control systems have been
   made to allow modes of operation not possible in the past, the problem
   of resilience to errors induced by hostile operating environments
   remains largely unexplored even though the probability of such errors
   occurring during real-time operation has increased. In this talk we
   propose mechanisms for detecting transient errors in control systems and
   circuitry as well as diagnosing and correcting for their effects on
   overall system operation. It is shown how real-number checksum encodings
   of circuit function can be used to detect and correct errors in the
   plant and feedback subsystems of linear control systems. Applications to
   signal processing and control algorithms are described. It is shown how
   errors in motor control electronics can be detected and corrected using
   the proposed methodology. Finally, extensions to nonlinear control
   systems are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Insertion of malicious Trojans into outsourced chip manufacturing
   generally results in increased capacitances of internal circuit nodes
   that have been tapped for node controllability and observability by
   malicious circuitry. Current path delay measurement and side channel
   Trojan detection techniques are unable to detect Trojans that present
   low loading to such tapped circuit nodes, especially in the presence of
   large manufacturing process variations. In this paper, a high-resolution
   Trojan detection method for digital logic based on pulse propagation is
   developed. The method exhibits 25X - 30X higher diagnostic resolution
   (ability to measure small capacitive loads on internal circuit nodes) as
   compared to current path delay based Trojan detection techniques in the
   presence of significant manufacturing process variations. Further, a key
   benefit is that theoretically, as opposed to path delay measurement
   based methods, the diagnostic resolution of the test approach is
   independent of circuit logic depth over and above the benefits already
   mentioned above. Test methods and test infrastructure compatible with
   existing scan based techniques are described. Simulation results are
   presented to prove the viability and effectiveness of the proposed
   Trojan detection scheme and especially for circuits with large logic
   depths (35-70 gates) suffering from worst case process variation
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an efficient power delivery network design for
   mitigating the coupling of power supply noise in mixed-signal
   electronics using power transmission lines. Digital circuitry operating
   at high data rates generates supply noise that can interfere with
   sensitive RF circuitry. Currently used methods, such as split planes and
   ferrite beads, have limited isolation bandwidth and can pose
   difficulties for signal integrity. Electromagnetic bandgap (EBG)
   structures have also been shown to exhibit excellent noise isolation. In
   this paper, a set of parallel digital buffers and a low noise amplifier
   are powered by a power transmission line instead of a voltage plane. An
   embedded bandstop filter in the power transmission line significantly
   reduces the amount of coupled noise between the digital and RF supply
   voltage pins. Test vehicles using this proposed method, as well as using
   an EBG structure were fabricated and tested. The proposed method shows a
   16dB decrease in coupled power as compared to the EBG. Incorporating an
   EBG in the power delivery network gives rise to impedance peaks that
   cause larger power supply noise at the supply pin of the buffers.
   Consequently, the proposed method also demonstrates significant
   improvement in signal and power integrity by reducing the power supply
   noise at the source, as shown in the conducted lab measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a distributed detection problem in a large, single-hop,
   wireless sensor network. Because of limited collection time and
   bandwidth, the fusion center (FC) is not able to collect the local
   observations from all sensor nodes. A distributed detection scheme with
   a selection strategy and a capability to operate in a finite bandwidth
   is required. We propose an ordered sequential detection scheme which
   jointly integrates a reliability-based splitting algorithm, an
   ordered-transmission strategy, and a sequential probability ratio test
   (SPRT). The proposed scheme allows the FC to collect the local
   observations in descending order of their reliabilities by using a
   reliability-based splitting algorithm. As it receives successfully
   transmitted observations, the FC sequentially decides whether to make a
   global decision or to continue collecting more local observations. The
   numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly
   outperforms a conventional SPRT scheme. The improvement increases as the
   number of sensor nodes in the network increases.}},

Abstract = {{Both ion implanted and POCl3 diffused emitters are used for industrial
   production of p-type Si solar cells. Formation of phosphorus doped
   emitter is known to perform gettering of impurities, however, gettering
   efficiency of these two diffusion techniques is not well quantified for
   single crystal Cz Si and Cast multi or Quasi-mono Si wafers. In
   addition, ion implantation can provide higher quality emitter with in
   situ oxide passivation{[}1]. This paper compares the performance of
   Quasi-mono and Cz Si cells fabricated with POCl3 and ion-implanted
   emitters. Quasi-mono wafers have more defects and are expected to
   benefit from gettering. Large area screen printed p-type industrial
   cells with full Al-BSF cell structure were fabricated on commercial
   grade single crystal Cz Si and two different Cast Quasi-mono Si wafers
   with 50\% and 80\% mono-crystalline regions. Bulk lifetime was measured
   to evaluate the gettering efficiency of each technology before and after
   each emitter formation{[}2]. POCl3 diffusion gave greater improvement in
   bulk lifetime of Quasi-mono wafers compared to ion implanted wafers,
   resulting in 0.7 similar to 1\% higher absolute efficiency and over 5
   similar to 15mV higher Voc compared to the implanted cells. However, in
   the case of Cz cells, bulk lifetime remained high and comparable for the
   two emitters. Therefore, Cz cells with implanted emitter gave 0.4\%
   higher efficiency and 7mV higher Voc due to a higher quality emitter
   with in situ front oxide passivation.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-agent networks are often modeled via interaction graphs, where the
   nodes represent the agents and the edges denote direct interactions
   between the corresponding agents. Interaction graphs have significant
   impact on the robustness of networked systems. One family of robust
   graphs is the random regular graphs. In this paper, we present a locally
   applicable reconfiguration scheme to build random regular graphs through
   self-organization. For any connected initial graph, the proposed scheme
   maintains connectivity and the average degree while minimizing the
   degree differences and randomizing the links. As such, if the average
   degree of the initial graph is an integer, then connected regular graphs
   are realized uniformly at random as time goes to infinity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an efficient linear programming (LP) formulation of
   asymmetric two player zero-sum stochastic games with finite horizon. In
   these stochastic games, only one player is informed of the state at each
   stage, and the transition law is only controlled by the informed player.
   Compared with the LP formulation of extensive stochastic games whose
   size grows polynomially with respect to the size of the state and the
   size of the uninformed player's actions, our proposed LP formulation has
   its size to be linear with respect to the size of the state and the size
   of the uninformed player, and hence greatly reduces the computational
   complexity. A travelling inspector problem is used to demonstrate the
   efficiency of the proposed LP formulation.}},

   presents a framework for strategic learning in sequential games with
   explicit consideration of both temporal and spatial coordination. The
   associated Bayes risk functions explicitly incorporate costs of taking
   private/public measurements, costs of time-difference and disagreement
   in actions of agents, and costs of false declaration/choices in the
   sequential hypothesis testing. The corresponding sequential decision
   processes have well-defined value functions with respect to (a) the
   belief states for the case of conditional independent private noisy
   measurements that are also assumed to be independent identically
   distributed over time, and (b) the information states for the case of

Abstract = {{We analyze an extension of the well-known linear consensus protocol for
   agents moving in two dimensions, where the standard consensus feedback
   is multiplied with a rotation matrix. This leads to a richer family of
   trajectories, and if only the new feedback term is applied, periodic
   solutions emerge. For special configurations of the controller gains,
   the form of the system trajectories is given in terms of the eigenvalues
   and eigenvectors of the closed-loop system matrix. We characterize the
   resulting closed-loop trajectories for specific choices of the
   controller gains and of the communication graph topology. Furthermore,
   the control strategy is extended to agents with double integrator
   dynamics. It is shown that stability is achieved with sufficiently large
   velocity feedback. The effect of this feedback on the overall system
   performance is further investigated. We finally provide simulations to
   illustrate the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a differential game of pursuit and evasion
   involving two players with constant, but different, speeds, and
   different maneuverability constraints. Specifically, the evader has
   limited maneuverability, while the pursuer is completely agile. This
   problem is an asymmetric version of the well-known Game of Two Cars. The
   aim of this paper is to derive the optimal strategies of the two players
   and characterize areas of initial conditions that lead to capture if the
   pursuer acts optimally, and areas that guarantee evasion regardless of
   the pursuer's strategy. It is shown that the problem reduces to a
   special version of Zermelo's Navigation Problem (ZNP) for the pursuer.
   Therefore, the well-known ZNP solution can be used to validate the
   results obtained through the differential game framework as well as to
   characterize the time-optimal trajectories. The results are directly
   applicable to collision avoidance problems.}},

Abstract = {{We provide a framework for the study of global games with noisy sharing
   of information. In contrast to the previous works where it is shown that
   an intuitive threshold policy is an equilibrium for such games, we show
   that noisy sharing of information leads to non-existence of such an
   equilibrium. We also investigate the group best-response dynamics of two
   groups of agents sharing the same information to threshold policies
   based on each group's observation and show the convergence of such

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of optimally scheduling the mode
   sequence and mode duration for switched dynamical systems under dwell
   time constraints that describe how long a system has to stay in a mode
   before they can switch to another mode. The schedule should minimize a
   given cost functional defined on the state trajectory. The topology of
   the optimization space for switched dynamical systems with and without
   dwell time constraints is investigated and it is shown that the notion
   of local optimality must be replaced by stationarity with regards to a
   suitably chosen optimality function when dwell time constraints are
   present. Hence, an optimality function is proposed to characterize the
   solution to the dwell time problem as points that satisfy optimality
   condition defined in terms of optimality function. A conceptual
   algorithm is presented to solve the mode scheduling problem and its
   convergence to stationary points is proved. A numerical example is given
   to highlight the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Control algorithms of networked multiagent systems are generally
   computed distributively without having a centralized entity monitoring
   the activity of agents; and therefore, adverse events such as attacks to
   the communication network and/or failure of agent-wise components can
   easily result in system instability and prohibit the accomplishment of
   system-level objectives. This paper studies resilient coordination of
   networked multiagent systems in the presence of misbehaving agents,
   i.e., agents that are subject to such adverse events. In particular, we
   consider a class of adverse conditions consisting of exogenous
   disturbances and interagent uncertainties, and present a distributed
   adaptive control architecture to retrieve the nominal networked
   multiagent system behavior. Departing from the existing relevant
   literature that make specific assumptions on the graph topology and/or
   the fraction of misbehaving agents, we show that the considered class of
   adverse conditions can be mitigated through a new adaptive control
   methodology that utilizes a local state emulator - even if all agents
   are misbehaving. A illustrative numerical example is provided to
   demonstrate the theoretical findings.}},

Abstract = {{In our recent work, we proposed a series of binary decision diagram
   (BDD-) based approaches for developing the maximally permissive deadlock
   avoidance policy (DAP) for a class of complex resource allocation
   systems (RAS). In this paper, (i) we extend these approaches by
   introducing a procedure that generates a set of comprehensible
   ``guard{''} predicates to represent the resulting DAP, and (ii) we
   customize them to the problem of deadlock avoidance in shared-memory
   multithreaded software, that has been previously addressed by the Gadara
   project. In the context of this last application, the generated guards
   can be instrumented directly into the source code of the underlying
   software threads, providing, thus, a very efficient and natural
   representation of the target policy. At the same time, by integrating
   the representational and computational strengths of symbolic
   computation, the presented approach can support the computation of the
   maximally permissive DAP for RAS corresponding to problem instances of
   even larger scale and complexity than those addressed in the current
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{A network of locally interacting agents can be thought of as performing
   a distributed computation. But not all computations can be faithfully
   distributed. This paper discusses which global linear transformations
   can be computed in finite time using local weighting rules, i.e., rules
   which rely solely on information from adjacent nodes in a network.
   Additionally, it is shown that the degree of nonholonomy of the
   computation can be related to the underlying information exchange graph.
   The main result states that the degree of nonholonomy of the system
   dynamics is equal to D - 1 where D is the diameter of the information
   exchange graph. An optimal control problem is solved for finding the
   local interaction rules, and a simulation is performed to elucidate how
   optimal solutions can be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a unified framework to address the problem of
   optimal nonlinear analysis and feedback control for partial stability
   and partial-state stabilization. Partial asymptotic stability of the
   closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov
   function that is positive definite and decrescent with respect to part
   of the system state which can clearly be seen to be the solution to the
   steady-state form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and hence,
   guaranteeing both partial stability and optimality. The overall
   framework provides the foundation for extending optimal linear-quadratic
   controller synthesis to nonlinear-nonquadratic optimal partial-state
   stabilization. Connections to optimal linear and nonlinear regulation
   for linear and nonlinear time-varying systems with quadratic and
   nonlinear nonquadratic cost functionals are also provided. An
   illustrative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to congestion management at
   traffic-light intersections. The approach is based on controlling the
   relative lengths of red/green cycles in order to have the congestion
   level track a given reference. It uses an integral control with adaptive
   gains, designed to provide fast tracking and wide stability margins. The
   gains are inverse-proportional to the derivative of the plant-function
   with respect to the control parameter, and are computed by infinitesimal
   perturbation analysis. Convergence of this technique is shown to be
   robust with respect to modeling uncertainties, computing errors, and
   other random effects. The framework is presented in the setting of
   stochastic hybrid systems, and applied to a particular traffic-light
   model. This is but an initial study and hence the latter model is
   simple, but it captures some of the salient features of traffic-light
   processes. The paper concludes with comments on possible extensions of
   the proposed approach to traffic-light grids with realistic flow models.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of distributed learning literature focuses on convergence
   to Nash equilibria. Correlated equilibria, on the other hand, can often
   characterize more efficient collective behavior than even the best Nash
   equilibrium. However, there are no existing distributed learning
   algorithms that converge to specific correlated equilibria. In this
   paper, we provide one such algorithm which guarantees that the agents'
   collective joint strategy will constitute an efficient correlated
   equilibrium with high probability. The key to attaining efficient
   correlated behavior through distributed learning involves incorporating
   a common random signal into the learning environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a new methodology to analyze the impact of a
   distribution of autonomy and authority within a concept of operation.
   Unlike Human-In-The-Loop methods, this computational methodology uses
   the Work Models that Compute framework to simulate the concept of
   operation in the very early design phases. The two key metrics assess
   the trace of all actions that each agent needs to perform, as well as
   all the information that needs to be exchanged.
   To demonstrate in a five aircraft scenario, the lead aircraft performs
   an Optimal Profile Descent arrival. Every following aircraft is tasked
   with maintaining an interval of 60 seconds behind the aircraft
   immediately in front of it. Unlike current day operations, where the air
   traffic controller is responsible for ensuring spacing, this authority
   was given to the pilots. The simulation provides a time trace of the
   actions performed by every pilot and the information exchanges within
   lead aircraft and in-trail aircraft pilot pairs. In this case, this
   method quickly identified how the information requirement increases in
   frequency further back in the aircraft sequence.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a low-cost dual-tone radio interferometric
   positioning system using a single mobile anchor, named mDRIPS. There is
   no synchronization requirement between the mobile anchor and the target.
   In mDRIPS, the static target continuously transmits a dual-tone signal,
   and the mobile anchor receives the signal at different positions along
   its trajectory. The instability of the target clock is taken into
   account. An ESPRIT-type algorithm is developed to estimate frequencies
   of the dual-tone signal for the subsequent phase estimation.
   Furthermore, the time of arrival (TOA) is extracted from the phase
   estimate of the received dual-tone signal. After measuring several TOAs
   at different locations along the anchor's trajectory, the target can be
   located. The mDRIPS is robust to flat-fading channels. Since the
   frequency difference of the two tones of the dual-tone signal is
   designed to be smaller than the channel coherence bandwidth, the same
   fading effect on these two tones can be eliminated. Moreover, we
   investigate the integer ambiguity problem due to phase wrapping, and
   develop a localization algorithm to deal with a simplified ambiguity
   problem. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   mDRIPS.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a relatively novel computing paradigm
   where there is a tight integration of communications, computation, and
   the physical environment. An important component of the CPS devices is
   the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world
   around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural
   health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops,
   and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless,
   current security models consider protecting only networking components
   of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an
   intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network
   protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to
   protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using
   sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can
   successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger
   existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of
   different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS
   devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats
   to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel
   threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the
   performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot
   Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on
   iRobot through its infrared channel. Finally, we introduce the design of
   a novel sensory channel aware intrusion detection system as a protection
   mechanism against the sensory channel threats for CPS devices.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous re-authentication of users is a must to protect connections
   with long duration against any malicious activity. Users can be
   re-authenticated in numerous ways. One popular way is an approach that
   requires the presentation of two or more authentication factors (i.e.,
   knowledge, possession, identity) called Multi-factor authentication
   (MFA). Given the market dominance of ubiquitous computing systems (e.g.,
   cloud), MFA systems have become vital in re-authenticating users.
   Knowledge factor (i.e., passwords) is the most ubiquitous authentication
   factor; however, forcing a user to re-enter the primary factor, a
   password, at frequent intervals could significantly lower the usability
   of the system. Unfortunately, an MFA system with a possession factor
   (e.g., Security tokens) usually depends on the distribution of some
   specific device, which is cumbersome and not user-friendly. Similarly,
   MFA systems with an identity factor (e.g., physiological biometrics,
   keystroke pattern) suffer from a relatively low deployability and are
   highly intrusive and expose users sensitive information to untrusted
   servers. These servers can keep physically identifying elements of
   users, long after the user ends the relationship with the server. To
   address these concerns, in this poster, we introduce our initial design
   of a privacy-preserving multi-factor re-authentication framework. The
   first factor is a password while the second factor is a hybrid profile
   of user behavior with a large combination of host-and network-based
   features. Our initial results are very promising as our framework can
   successfully validate legitimate users while detecting impostors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a stochastic geometrybased channel model for
   wideband single-input single-output (SISO) shallow underwater acoustic
   (UWA) channels under the assumption that the ocean surface and bottom
   are rough. Starting from a geometrical model, we derive a reference
   model assuming that the scatterers are randomly distributed on the
   surface and the bottom of the water. The probability density functions
   (PDFs) of the angle-of-departure (AOD) and the angle-of-arrival (AOA) of
   the reference model are analyzed. Furthermore, the two-dimensional (2D)
   time-frequency correlation function (T-FCF) of the reference model is
   studied. From the reference model, we then derive the corresponding
   simulation model by applying the generalized concept of deterministic
   channel modelling. For the parametrization of the UWA channel simulator,
   we propose a new method which is further on called the method of equally
   spaced scatterers (MESS). The performance of the MESS is compared with
   that of the L-p-norm method (LPNM). It is shown that our design concept
   results in an excellent match between the T-FCF of the reference model
   and that of the simulation model. It is also shown that both the MESS
   and the LPNM have a similar performance, whereby the MESS provides a
   closed-form solution, while the LPNM does not.}},

Abstract = {{Physical prototypes play a crucial role in any design project; but all
   the critical effects that physical prototypes have need to be further
   studied. Often, design courses (including capstone courses) include some
   type of prototyping. More needs to be understood about what students
   need to learn from prototyping and the benefits of hands-on learning.
   Physical prototypes help designers by providing critical feedback on
   their designs. Existing literature shows the importance of prototyping
   in design projects, while some researchers are concerned with the design
   fixation caused by prototyping. In order to maximize the benefits of
   prototyping, it is essential to study the design thinking involved in
   it. This knowledge may help designers, especially novice designers and
   students in making decisions about which prototyping method to choose.
   In this study, data are collected from a realistic design project
   carried out by a team of professional designers. Through interviews with
   the designers and direct observations on the prototyping and testing
   cycle, the following hypotheses are investigated: (1) Building and
   testing prototypes helps to supplement designers' incomplete mental
   models leading them to better ideas and (2) Prototyping leads designers
   to design fixation. The results strongly support the hypotheses. Data
   from the current study is also compared to prior research on
   semester-long graduate student team projects. This prior research
   indicates that many unarticulated tests occur when prototypes are built
   and this leads to a significant number of improvements to the product.
   Surprisingly, this also occurred with the practicing designers. This
   demonstrates that the engineering design curriculum may need to adapt to
   better teach students to take advantage of the unexpected and students
   must have building skills in order to leverage this advantage. The data
   also show that building simple physical prototypes frequently in a
   design project helps to eliminate the shortcomings in initial ideas and
   lead designers to better ideas. In order to reduce the fixation
   associated with prototyping, it is essential to minimize the cost (in
   terms of money, time and effort) associated with prototyping. Due to the
   need for low sunk cost and opportunities to learn in unexpected ways
   from prototypes, engineering students need to have proficient building
   and testing skills so prototypes do not induce fixation due to sunk
   cost. The professional design team also did things the student design
   teams did not. The professional team built representational prototypes
   and those with selected functionalities at times. They also used
   strategies that likely reduce design fixation including prototyping only
   parts of the system and systematically used low cost materials like wood
   and plastic when testing physical interfaces for fit and assembly, not
   structural capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad-hoc networks (VANETs) provide a way for a vehicle to
   deliver various types of information to users or drivers in other
   vehicles. Distributing a large amount of information such as multimedia
   messages in a single control channel makes the control channel easily
   congested. Transmitting multimedia messages through multi-channel to
   avoid this congestion becomes a feasible solution. However,
   low-connectivity in a low vehicle density in multi-channel poses unique
   challenges and can produce connection failure if this issue is not
   carefully addressed. In this paper, a network coding technique with
   divide-and-deliver is introduced to solve this unique challenge for
   delivering multimedia contents through multiple service channels in a
   low vehicle density. Through the rigorous analytical derivation and
   extensive simulation, we show the proposed scheme significantly improves
   reliability with minimum usage of the control channels in a typical

   framework of single-shot and repeated Bayesian games. In a single-shot

Abstract = {{Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov ` asz (LLL) lattice reduction technique has been
   applied to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detectors to collect
   full diversity while enjoying low complexity. However, the original LLL
   algorithm has variable complexity, which is not desirable in hardware
   implementation. To solve this problem, some fixed-complexity LLL (fcLLL)
   algorithms have recently been proposed by using the fixed-column
   traverse strategy with limited number of LLL iterations. The existing
   fcLLL algorithms are designed to process each column with equal
   priority, which is not optimized in terms of error performance and
   complexity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fcLLL algorithm with a
   novel column traverse strategy by allocating priorities to columns based
   on the characteristics of LLL and MIMO detection. In addition, we
   propose an improved termination criterion without sacrificing the error
   performance in the proposed fcLLL algorithm. Simulations show that our
   proposed fcLLL algorithm converges faster than LLL and existing fcLLL
   algorithms, and yields better error performance than the LLL and
   existing fcLLL algorithms when the maximum number of LLL iterations is
   fixed. Furthermore, in large MIMO systems, our proposed fcLLL algorithm
   exhibits significant complexity advantage, saving about 90\% LLL
   iterations in average compared to the existing fcLLL algorithms for a
   128x128 MIMO system with 64-QAM.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) wireless communication, which escalates the
   frequency and provides unprecedented data rates, is envisioned as the
   key picocell wireless technology in the next five to ten years. In this
   band, the medium access control (MAC) is more about ``scheduling
   transmissions,{''} instead of ``fighting for access,{''} thanks to the
   huge bandwidth. On the one hand, an electronically steerable narrow beam
   is essential to overcome the high path loss at THz and extend the
   communication range. On the other hand, impulse radio in THz Band that
   generates femtosecond-long pulses enables the beam direction to be
   switched at the ``pulse-level,{''} in contrast to the conventional
   ``packet-level{''} switching as seen in literature. To capture these
   features, yet keep complexity low, we assume a simple time-spread

Abstract = {{Takens' Embedding Theorem asserts that when the states of a hidden
   dynamical system are confined to a low-dimensional attractor, complete
   information about the states can be preserved in the observed
   time-series output through the delay coordinate map. However, the
   conditions for the theorem to hold ignore the effects of noise and
   time-series analysis in practice requires a careful empirical
   determination of the sampling time and number of delays resulting in a
   number of delay coordinates larger than the minimum prescribed by
   Takens' theorem. In this paper, we use tools and ideas in Compressed
   Sensing to provide a first theoretical justification for the choice of
   the number of delays in noisy conditions. In particular, we show that
   under certain conditions on the dynamical system, linear measurement
   function, number of delays and sampling time, the delay-coordinate map
   can be a stable embedding of the dynamical systems attractor.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a sparseness-based blind source separation (BSS)
   method. In contrast to conventional approaches, we exploit the
   sparseness property and the ensuing approximate disjointness of the
   competing audio signals when represented in the short time Fourier
   transform domain to determine the linear separating matrix such that its
   outputs are maximally disjoint. By doing so, we deduce an iterative
   gradient descent to estimate the optimal separation matrix.
   Interestingly, the resulting optimization problem is shown to have
   strong links with independent component analysis using higher order
   statistics, and shares some similarity with non-stationarity-based BSS.
   The purpose of the proposed study is to provide some insight into the

Abstract = {{Network coevolution, the process of network topology evolution in
   feedback with dynamical processes over the network nodes, is a common
   feature of many engineered and natural networks. In such settings, the
   change in network topology occurs at a comparable time scale to nodal
   dynamics. Coevolutionary modeling offers the possibility to better
   understand how and why network structures emerge. For example, social
   networks can exhibit a variety of structures, ranging from almost
   uniform to scale-free degree distributions. While current models of
   network formation can reproduce these structures, coevolutionary
   modeling can offer a better understanding of the underlying dynamics.
   This paper presents an overview of recent work on coevolutionary models
   of network formation, with an emphasis on the following three settings:
   (i) dynamic flow of benefits and costs, (ii) transient link
   establishment costs, and (iii) latent preferential attachment.}},

   addresses a full-reference version of the proposed indices. The proposed
   quality index has three components: harmonic chaos analysis, phase chaos
   analysis, and pooling. The first two parts produce two maps that are
   weighted and summed to produce a single map. Then, we use the mean of
   the logarithmically scaled combined map as the quality index. We further
   propose a multi-scale variation of the index. Experimental evaluations
   were conducted on more than 1,300 images from the TID2013 image
   database. We specifically test the quality index on three distortion
   categories: Simple, Actual, and Noise. Then, we cross-validate the

Abstract = {{An average healthy person does not perceive the world in just black and
   white. Moreover, the perceived world is not composed of pixels and
   through vision humans perceive structures. However, the acquisition and
   display systems discretize the world. Therefore, we need to consider
   pixels, structures and colors to model the quality of experience.
   Quality assessment methods use the pixel-wise and structural metrics
   whereas color science approaches use the patch-based color differences.
   In this work, we combine these approaches by extending CIEDE2000 formula
   with perceptual color difference to assess image quality. We examine how
   perceptual color difference-based metric (PCDM) performs compared to
   PSNR, CIEDE2000, SSIM, MS-SSIM and CW-SSIM on the LIVE database. In
   terms of linear correlation, PCDM obtains compatible results under white
   noise (97.9\%), Jpeg (95.9\%) and Jp2k (95.6\%) with an overall
   correlation of 92.7\%. We also show that PCDM captures color-based
   artifacts that can not be captured by structure-based metrics.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of seismic interpretation, univariate data-based maps are
   commonly used by interpreters, especially for fault detection. In these

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel perceptual video quality assessment metric
   for streamed videos using optical flow statistical features. We analyze
   the impact of network losses on the decoded videos and the resulting
   error propagation. We show that the statistical features of the optical
   flow of the corrupted frames can be used to measure the distortion in
   the received video. We show that this approach is suitable for videos
   with complex motion patterns. Our technique does not make any
   assumptions on the coding conditions, network loss patterns or error
   concealment techniques. The proposed approach is pixel-based and relies
   only on the inconsistency of the optical flow of the corrupted frames.
   We validate our proposed quality metric by testing it on a variety of
   coded sequences subject to network losses from the recently proposed
   LIVE mobile database. Our results show that the proposed metric can
   estimate perceptual quality of channel-induced distortions at the frame
   and sequence levels. For the test videos, we report Pearson's and
   Spearman's correlation coefficients with the temporal mean opinion
   scores (MOSs) reported in the database. The results show average
   correlations of 0.91 and 0.92 for the test sequences, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneously achieving the objective of high data rate communications
   that is resistant to interference (RTI) is a challenging problem.
   Communications systems typically operate at a reduced information rate
   for RTI operation. To achieve the objective of high data rate and RTI
   operation, we have developed a modulation called Frequency Position
   Modulation (FPM) in which the absolute position of the tones in
   frequency correspond to a symbol. The tones themselves are spread over
   an extremely wide instantaneous bandwidth resulting in a communications
   system that is difficult to intercept. FPM leverages carefully shaped
   nonlinearities generated by the high-power amplifier (HPA) of the
   transmitter that become a part of the symbols in the constellation. The
   addition of nonlinearities improves the diversity of the FPM
   constellation for resilience in the face of interference. Information at
   the receiver is recovered by mixing the incoming spectrum with multiple
   tones in conjunction with a comb filter before digitization. This
   enables using commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) high dynamic range
   analog-to-digital converters sampling at a fraction of the rate of the
   bandwidth over which the symbols are spread. FPM can provide nearly an
   order of magnitude improvement in processing gain over conventional RTI
   communications (e.g., CDMA) and facilitates the ability to operate in
   interference-laden environments where conventional receivers would fail.
   We quantitatively analyze the symbol error rate (SER) and processing
   gain (PG) for a maximum likelihood (ML) based FPM demodulator and
   demonstrate its performance in interference-laden conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the concept of dictionary learning and sparse coding applied
   to audio spectrograms. First, we statistically generate a dictionary of
   feature vectors by sampling many columns of input spectrograms. Then,
   using `1-regularized least-squares optimization, we transform the
   columns of the spectrogram into sparse coefficient vectors. Hence, the
   learned dictionary column features act as an overcomplete basis for the
   columns of the spectrograms. The dictionary generation portion of the
   algorithm is completely unsupervised. Next we use the coefficient data
   to train a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the acoustic data.
   Using this method, we classified one-minute audio samples of chicken
   vocalizations from a controlled environment into two groups: healthy and
   infected with infectious bronchitis (IB). We obtained a classification
   accuracy of 97.85\%.}},

   training data consisted of eight minutes of manually labeled audio
   selected from 25 days of continuous recording from a controlled study.
   The experiment group was challenged with the infectious bronchitis virus
   and became sick, while the control group remained healthy. We tested the
   algorithm on the entire dataset and obtained results that match the
   course of the disease. Algorithms such as this could be used to

   (D2D) communications since it can bring more freedoms for potential D2D
   pairs. In this paper, we investigate optimal D2D mode switching to
   maximize the network spectrum-efficiency (SE). We formulate the optimal
   SE problems in three D2D transmission modes, dedicated mode, reusing
   mode and cellular mode, while guaranteeing the quality of -service (QoS)
   requirements for both the D2D pairs and the regular cellular users
   (RCUs). Bisection algorithm is adopted to solve the quasiconvex
   optimization problems in the dedicated and cellular modes through
   transforming the original problem into a sequence of convex feasibility
   problems. For the reusing mode, concave-convex procedure (CCCP) is used
   to solve the difference of convex (D. C.) optimization problem.
   Simulation results show that system SE can be improved significantly
   with the proposed mode switching algorithm compared with the single mode
   transmission without mode switching.}},

Abstract = {{RNA-seq data analysis pipelines are generally composed of sequence
   alignment, expression quantification, expression normalization, and
   differentially expressed gene (DEG) detection. Each step has numerous
   specific tools or algorithms, so we cannot explore all combinatorial
   pipelines and provide a comprehensive comparison of pipeline
   performance. To understand the mechanism of RNA-seq data analysis
   pipelines and provide some useful information for pipeline selection, we
   believe it is necessary to analyze the interactions among pipeline
   components. In this paper, by combining different alignment algorithms
   with the same quantification, normalization, and DEG detection tools, we
   construct nine RNA-seq pipelines to analyze the impact of RNA-seq
   alignment on downstream applications of gene expression estimates.
   Specifically, we find moderate linear correlation between the number of
   DEGs detected and the percentage of reads aligned with zero mismatch.}},

Abstract = {{Medication errors significantly impact patient health and quality of
   care. In this study, systems modeling and simulation are used to analyze
   the medication workflow in a pediatric setting. The resulting simulation
   system allows for derivation and validation of effective intervention
   strategies for error mitigation. The analysis focused on `High Alert'
   medications, which are more likely to produce serious patient harm when
   errors occur. Our study shows that strategic process interventions
   (e.g., independent intervention check points) can significantly reduce
   error occurrence (by as much as 50.25\%) and the cost savings could be
   significant. We analyze the cost-savings versus intervention
   effectiveness versus the cost of the extra resource needed to perform
   the intervention, and identify the break-even point. The estimated
   errors from our model remain consistently close to the reported error
   statistics (within 5\%). This work offers a system-decision support
   framework for analysis of medication workflow and helps in understanding
   error propagation mechanisms and process interdependencies. The
   framework allows users to derive intervention strategies and evaluate
   their overall mitigation effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the problem of achieving a positive error-free
   communications rate without being detected by an eavesdropper-we coin
   this the privacy rate. Specifically, we present the privacy rate over
   Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels when an
   eavesdropper employs a radiometer detector and has uncertainty about her
   noise variance. Leveraging recent results on the phenomenon of an Signal
   to Noise Ratio (SNR) wall when there is eavesdropper noise power
   measurement uncertainty, we show that a non-zero privacy rate is
   possible. We also find the SNR wall under Rayleigh fading. We conclude
   by presenting realizable privacy rates for several practical scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Social recommender systems exploit the historic user data as well as
   user relations in the social networks to make recommendations. However,
   users are increasingly concerned with their online privacy, and hence,
   they are not willing to reveal their personal data to the general
   public. In this paper, we propose a social recommendation algorithm for
   top-N recommendation using only implicit user preference data. In
   particular, we model users' consumption behavior in the social network
   with Bayesian networks, using which we can infer the probabilities for
   items to be selected by each user. We develop an Expectation Propagation
   (EP) message-passing algorithm to perform approximate inference
   efficiently in the constructed Bayesian network. The original proposed
   algorithm is a central scheme, in which the user data are collected and
   processed by a central authority. However, it can be easily adapted for
   a distributed implementation, where users only exchange messages with
   their directly connected friends in the social network. This helps
   further protect user privacy, as users do not release any data to the
   public. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the Epinions dataset, and
   compare it with other existing social recommendation algorithms. The
   results show its superior top-N recommendation performance in terms of
   recall.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication allows bio nodes to communicate and cooperate in
   an aqueous environment. We recently proposed an m-ary modulation scheme
   in which the information is encoded into the concentration of molecules
   emitted by the bio nodes. The performance of such scheme, among other
   factors, is limited by the maximum concentration of molecules that can
   be induced by the transmitter at the receiver. This paper investigates
   relaying to improve the reliability of such molecular communication. We
   consider the case that nodes consist of a population of biological
   agents and study the scenario in which the relay node decodes the
   incoming information symbol and forwards it to the destination using the
   same or a different type of molecules as the transmitter. We show how
   the use of relaying in molecular communication can increase the
   effective range of molecular concentration induced at the receiver and
   also can help with achieving diversity at the receiver. We use a
   generalized form of Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) and show as to how the
   probability of error is improved using the optimal relaying. We also
   compare this scenario with the case that the relay node uses the same
   type of the molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as a key
   technology to satisfy the increasing demand for ultra-broadband wireless
   communication. THz Band communication will alleviate the spectrum
   scarcity and capacity limitations of current wireless systems, and
   enable new applications both in classical networks and novel nanoscale
   networks. In this paper, a novel distance-aware multi-carrier (DAMC)
   modulation scheme is developed for both single-transmitter
   single-receiver and single-transmitter multiple-receiver cases in THz
   Band communication. The developed DAMC modulation scheme takes advantage
   of the distance-and frequency-dependent channel peculiarities, and
   provides adaptive utilization of the ultra-broad bandwidth in the THz
   Band. Furthermore, the data rates of the DAMC scheme are analytically
   investigated, numerically evaluated, and compared with existing
   single-band pulse-based modulation and fixed-bandwidth adaptive
   modulation. The results show that data rates can be improved by one
   order of magnitude by using the DAMC scheme, at the costs of design
   complexity for the control unit, multi-carrier modulator and channel
   feedback path.}},

Abstract = {{Objective metrics model image quality by quantifying image degradations
   or estimating perceived image quality. However, image quality metrics do
   not model what makes an image more appealing or beautiful. In order to
   quantify the aesthetics of an image, we need to take it one step further
   and model the perception of aesthetics. In this paper, we examine
   computational aesthetics models that use hand-crafted, generic and
   hybrid descriptors. We show that generic descriptors can perform as well
   as state of the art hand-crafted aesthetics models that use global
   features. However, neither generic nor hand-crafted features is
   sufficient to model aesthetics when we only use global features without
   considering spatial composition or distribution. We also follow a visual
   dictionary approach similar to state of the art methods and show that it
   performs poorly without the spatial pyramid step.}},

   this paper, we present a new technique that automatically tracks faults
   across a 3D seismic volume. To implement automation, we propose a
   two-way fault line projection based on estimated tracking vectors. In
   the tracking process, projected fault lines are integrated into a
   synthesized line as the tracked fault line, through an optimization
   process with local geological constraints. The tracking algorithm is
   evaluated using real-world seismic data sets with promising results. The
   proposed method provides comparable accuracy to the detection of faults
   explicitly in every seismic section, and it also reduces computational
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Using the inverse sensor model has been popular in occupancy grid
   mapping. However, it is widely known that applying the inverse sensor
   model to mapping requires certain assumptions that are not necessarily

   methods like expectation maximization or Gibbs sampling which have been
   succeeded by more effective methods of maximum a posteriori (MAP)
   inference over graphical models. In this paper, we propose the use of
   modern MAP inference methods along with the forward sensor model. Our
   implementation and experimental results demonstrate that these modern

Abstract = {{One of the key elements for building a long-term robotic companion is
   incorporating the ability for a robot to continuously learn and engage
   in new tasks. Utilizing a defined workspace that provides various shared
   content between human and robot could assist in this learning process.
   Here, we propose integrating a touchscreen tablet and a robot learner
   for engaging the user during human-robot interaction scenarios. The
   robot learner's domain-independent core reasoner follows the structure
   of instance-based learning which addresses the issues of acquiring
   knowledge, encoding cases, and learning a retrieval metric. The system
   utilizes demonstrations provided by the user to auto-populate the
   knowledge base through natural interaction methods, encodes cases based
   on the feature structure provided by the user, and uses an
   adaptive-weighting technique to design a retrieval metric with linear
   regression in the feature-distance space. Through a tablet environment,
   the user teaches a task to the robot in a shared workspace and
   intuitively monitors the robot's behavior and progress in real time. In
   this setting, the user is able to interrupt the robot and provide
   necessary demonstrations at the moment learning is taking place, thus
   providing a means to continuously engage both the participant and the
   robot in the learning cycle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an autonomous planning and control framework for
   humanoid robots to climb general ladder-and stair-like structures. The
   approach consists of two major components: 1) a multi-limbed locomotion
   planner that takes as input a ladder model and automatically generates a
   whole-body climbing trajectory that satisfies contact, collision, and
   torque limit constraints; 2) a compliance controller which allows the
   robot to tolerate errors from sensing, calibration, and execution.
   Simulations demonstrate that the robot is capable of climbing a wide
   range of ladders and tolerating disturbances and errors. Physical
   experiments demonstrate the DRCHubo humanoid robot successfully
   mounting, climbing, and dismounting an industrial ladder similar to the
   one intended to be used in the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials.}},

Abstract = {{Force feedback haptic devices require physical contact between the
   operator and the machine, creating a coupled system where the stiffness
   changes based on that of the operator's arm. The natural human tendency
   to increase arm stiffness to stabilize motion increases the overall
   stiffness and reduces stability. Controllers commonly address this with
   increased damping, which slows the device and decreases operator
   efficiency. Previous research designed a system to estimate operator arm
   stiffness by measuring muscle activity and compensate accordingly,
   modifying the robot's motion based on operator interactions. This
   achieved the goal of reducing oscillations and increasing performance,
   but encountered drawbacks related to the unpredictable way in which
   humans modulate the dynamic parameters of their arm. Controllers
   designed to be robust to stochastic variation of system parameters are
   explored, and their effectiveness is validated experimentally. This
   could further increase the operator performance and reduce fatigue,
   which could translate into better efficiency and higher productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the needs to develop dexterous flexonic mobile node (FMN)
   for structural health monitoring where obstacle avoidance is among the
   most challenging tasks, this paper presents a novel FMN design for
   navigating on iron-based structures. Unlike most existing magnetic wheel
   designs, the FMN uses fixed-magnet configuration contributing to smooth
   motion, self-maintained orientation and automatic negotiation of concave
   corners. Taking into account of several stringent considerations
   (including tight dimension, efficient attachment and manipulation
   flexibility) to facilitate avoidance of structural obstacles in tight
   space, a prototype FMN incorporating a compliant beam (that results in
   more DOFs than designs with multiple links and pin/ball joints), along
   with a 3-step strategy for negotiating a convex corner, has been
   developed. Although controlling a continuous deforming beam is
   challenging given limited number of actuators, both simulation and
   experimental results confirm a simple input/output relation between the
   rear axle displacement and front axle rotation, which is anticipated to
   facilitate control implementation of FMN for obstacle avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of network traffic characterization is to explore unknown
   patterns in different types of network communications to help improve
   many aspects of the network. While many previous studies have explored
   the characterization of many different networks (e.g., university
   networks), the power grid network (and other SCADA networks)
   characterization has not yet been studied. In this paper, we provide a
   characterization of the power grid network to answer questions like the
   following: i) how stable is the communication based on configurations?;
   ii) are there different observable traffic patterns in different vendor
   equipment?; iii) are there trends in the network traffic?; iv) can
   information be gathered from the traffic characterization to help secure
   the power grid network? To address these questions, we have collected
   power grid network traffic in a live substation for two months and
   conducted an empirical study to identify network traffic behaviors in
   the live substation. Our empirical study shows different behaviors
   between the devices and vendors when they communicate with each other.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly every aspect of modern life today, from businesses,
   transportation, and healthcare, depends on the power grid operating
   safely and reliably. While the recent push for a ``Smart Grid{''} has
   shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an
   after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a
   variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe
   operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their
   configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for
   outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops
   the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide
   authenticated access control and security monitoring for these
   vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device
   and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation. Our
   results suggest that such a system can be deployed with negligible
   impact on normal operations, while providing important security
   mechanisms. By doing so, we demonstrate that our proposal is a practical
   and efficient solution for retro-fitting security onto crucial power
   system devices.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological rationality is the study of when certain decision making
   strategies exploit specific environments so efficiently that further
   information and computation would not necessarily increase accuracy.
   This perspective challenges many of the normative accounts of
   rationality by arguing that heuristics, i.e. decision making strategies
   that ignore some available information, in some environments can make
   decisions faster, more efficiently, and/or more accurately than analytic
   decision making strategies. The challenge for many researchers and
   proponents of ecological rationality is to determine when heuristics are
   ecologically rational. Research has previously identified some important
   environmental structures: uncertainty, redundancy, sample size, and
   variability in weights. This paper introduces a new environmental
   structure, a measure of distribution of incomplete information called
   complete attribute pairs, and shows how this structure indicates when
   two well-studied heuristics, Take-the-Best (TTB) and Tallying, are
   ecologically rational under conditions of incomplete information.
   Specifically this paper presents the results of a simulation measuring
   the accuracy and effort of TTB and Tallying alongside two analytic
   decision making strategies, weighted-additive (WADD) and equal weighting
   (EW), in scenarios with incomplete information, showing that the
   analytic strategies were almost invariant to changes in complete
   attribute pairs while increases in complete attribute pairs increased
   the accuracy of TTB and Tallying. These results identify complete
   attribute pairs as a parameter that is potentially capable of indicating
   ecological rationality of TTB and Tallying.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the use of Work Domain Analysis (WDA), a
   technique from the field of cognitive engineering, to inform the
   creation of options and constraints for Reinforcement Learning (RL)
   algorithms. The micro-world of Pac-Man, a classic arcade game, is used
   as a tractable and representative work domain. WDA was conducted on
   individuals familiar with Pac-Man and an Abstraction Hierarchy (AH), a
   means-ends representation of their understanding of the game, was
   created for each individual. The abstraction hierarchies for best
   performing and worst performing individuals were then combined to
   illustrate the differences between the different groups. Several
   differences between the two groups were found, and included the use of
   defense as well as offensive strategies by high performers versus only
   defense by poor performers, context sensitivity and additional goals and
   more sophisticated constraints by high performers. The differences were
   translated into an options and constraint paradigm suitable for
   incorporation into RL algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in underwater technology, human divers are still
   employed to carry out a wide variety of dangerous underwater tasks. To
   enable a diver to complete tasks safer and more efficiently, it is
   proposed that an Underwater Robotic Assistant (UWRA) could act as a
   robotic dive buddy. For example, the UWRA could ferry tools from the
   surface, carry scientific samples, and provide illumination in dark
   environments. However, one of the major hurdles to operating autonomous
   systems below the water's surface is that high-frequency radio signals
   are greatly attenuated by water. This severely limits the type of
   commands a diver can issue to the robot. Thus, one of the contributions
   of this paper is an analysis of the types of Underwater Human-Robot
   Communication (UHRC) that are possible between a diver and a UWRA.
   Following the analysis, we discuss implementation of a few of the
   proposed methods of UHRC where an underwater robot assists a diver
   during the installation of an underwater mechanical platform.}},

Abstract = {{Icebergs generated from ice ablation processes continue to be a threat
   for operations conducted in polar regions. Systems that have been
   developed to track and observe these threats often use either
   space-based radar imaging or visual observation by the crew of the ship.
   Both of these methods have disadvantages, mostly in terms of real-time
   observation or the physical abilities of the crew. We propose a robotic
   solution for in-situ observation of icebergs, so that countermeasures
   may be quickly implemented. Our focus in this work is the problem of
   allocating resources to observation regions: once areas of iceberg
   activity have been identified, how are robot observers assigned to these
   regions and what cost metric may be used to determine the best placement
   of robot observers. Our solution is currently demonstrated and evaluated
   in simulation.}},

   is demonstrated through simulations for various parameter values. We

Abstract = {{Stochastic wiring distribution models are used to predict the
   improvement in energy obtained by replacing a few or all copper metal
   levels with graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in a low-power digital circuit.
   The models developed here also estimate the degradation in the
   performance by replacing a few or all copper metal levels with GNRs.
   Replacing a few local copper interconnect levels with GNRs is expected
   to reduce the energy consumed by local interconnects, without severely
   degrading the performance of longer global interconnects. The hybrid
   GNR+copper interconnect is shown to perform worse compared to the all
   GNR interconnect, if the length of the GNR segment is greater than a
   critical value. For a logic circuit with 30k gates, it is shown that the
   hybrid interconnect offers a 30 to 40\% decrease in energy and a 4x
   decrease in maximum frequency, whereas the all GNR interconnect offers a
   50 to 60\% decrease in energy and a 7x decrease in maximum frequency.

Abstract = {{3D integration using a glass interposer and through glass via
   technologies is expected to improve the performance of a whole system
   significantly. However, due to the high quality factor of the glass
   substrate, the sharp impedance peaks on the Power Distribution Networks
   arise at the resonances. When the mode resonances occur, performance of
   a whole system could be degraded. Segmentation based impedance
   estimation was used to analyze the PDN impedance and analyzed system
   degradation at resonance frequencies. To maximize advantages of the
   glass interposers, the PDN should be carefully designed to suppress the
   resonances. Considering the current status of the glass fabrication
   processes, we propose that placing the ground vias near the signal vias
   is the most promising solution for maximizing the advantages of the

Abstract = {{As communication data rates increase, wideband signals are being
   increasingly used to accommodate high rates of information transmission.
   Acquiring and characterizing the time domain waveform of such signals
   requires high measurement system sampling rate and wide input bandwidth
   and is thus, expensive. A key problem that drives up the cost of
   traditional bandwidth interleaved data acquisition systems is the need
   to synchronize the input signal (periodic) with the sampling clock as
   well as the oscillator inputs to all the mixers in the band interleaved
   architecture. This synchronization problem is complicated at multi-GHz
   frequencies and increases overall design cost. In this paper, we propose
   a low-cost band-interleaved architecture that uses: (a) incoherent
   undersampling to acquire the signal across the frequency bands of the
   band-interleaved system and (b) does not require any mutual
   synchronization between the input signal, the undersampling clocks and
   the mixing signals (local oscillators) of each frequency band in the
   band-interleaved system. The reconstruction is achieved through back-end
   spectrum analysis and use of signal processing algorithms that
   compensate for the lack of synchronization. The proposed technique is
   supported by hardware validation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wire-tap channel system, it
   has been shown that artificial noise can be transmitted in the null
   space of the main channel to guarantee the secrecy at the intended
   receiver. Previous formulas for MIMO asymptotic capacity assume that all
   channel eigenmodes will be utilized. However, optimizing over possible
   antenna configurations requires partitioning the available eigenmodes.
   With only some eigenmodes used for signal transmission, finding an exact
   closed-form asymptotic solution is, in general, intractable. We present
   a large-scale MIMO approximation with eigenmode partitioning, accurate
   for realistic numbers of antennas, and with greatly reduced
   computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{We present results of modeling for the design of microgaps for the
   removal of high heat fluxes, i.e., 1 kW/cm(2), at low wall temperature
   (similar to 85 degrees C) via a strategy of very high mass flux (>1000
   kg/m(2)s), high quality (outlet vapor mass quality >90\%), two-phase
   forced convection. Modeling includes (1) thermodynamic analysis to
   obtain performance trends across a wide range of candidate coolants, (2)
   evaluation of worst-case pressure drop due to contraction and expansion
   in inlet/outlet manifolds, and (3) 1-D reduced order simulations to
   obtain realistic estimates of different contributions to the pressure
   drops. The main result is the identification of a general trend of
   improved heat transfer performance at higher system pressure at the cost
   of reduced achievable system efficiency (COP), with important
   implications for coolant selection and system design.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3D) stacking of semiconductor chips has the
   advantages of high electrical performance, including improved bandwidth,
   reduced wire interconnection lengths, low cost, and heterogeneous
   integration. However, the power density increases sharply within the
   stack and the thermal management challenges become major bottlenecks.
   Inter-tier microfluidic cooling with microgaps with surface area
   enhancements such as pin fins can potentially achieve superior thermal
   performance. As such, the hydraulic and thermal characteristics of this
   configuration over parametric ranges of practical interest are
   important. A lot of work has been done on circular cross-section pin
   fins, with only limited work on square pin fins. In this work, a
   parametric study was conducted for the first time to investigate the
   effect of all pin fin dimensions, including diameter(Dh), transversal
   (ST) and longitudinal (SL) spacing, height (Hp), and Re on Pressure drop
   (Delta P) in terms of friction factor (f) and Heat Transfer coefficient
   (HTC) in terms of Colburn j factor. Correlations of f and Colburn j
   factor were proposed for Re<100. The performance of circular and square
   micro pin fin were compared. The comparison results show that the
   circular micro pin fin array has better thermal performance under same

   data from literature. The results show that the operating conditions
   (bias applied and AC duty cycle) strongly impact the temperature within
   the device and the stress fluctuations during cyclic pulsing conditions.
   The peak stress from the inverse piezoelectric effect develops rapidly
   with applied bias and slowly relaxes as the joule heating increases the

Abstract = {{Generally, a porous jump model is used for rapid air flow simulations
   (without resolving the tile pore structure) through perforated tiles in
   data centers. The porous jump model only specifies a step pressure loss
   at the tile surface, without any influence on the flow field. However,
   in reality, the downstream flowfield is affected because of the momentum
   rise of air due to acceleration of air through the pores, and
   interaction of air jets emerging from the pores. The momentum rise could
   be captured by either directly resolving the tile pore structure, or
   simulated by specifying a momentum source above the tile surface.
   Specification of the momentum source obviates the need of resolving the
   tile pore geometry, and hence requires considerably lower computational
   effort. In previous investigations a momentum source in a specific
   region above the tile surface was imposed without providing a physical
   basis for its selection. The width and length of the momentum source
   region was the same as the tile dimensions. This model showed improved
   prediction with the experimental data, as well as with the model
   resolving the tile pore geometry. In the present investigation, we
   present a detailed analysis for obtaining the momentum source region
   dimensions and other associated input variables. The results from this
   rapid model are compared with the model resolving tile geometry and good
   agreement was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{To keep up with the growing energy demand, legacy air-cooled data
   centers have begun to implement simple but effective energy efficiency
   strategies or best practices. Improving ``air management{''}, optimizing
   the delivery of cool air and the collection of waste heat, are among
   these efficiency strategies. One of the most powerful tools for
   identifying energy wasteful practices is the application of the second
   law of thermodynamics to estimate the exergy destruction in a system.
   Exergy is defined as the ``available energy{''} in a system, hence
   wasteful practices are said to ``destroy exergy.{''} Systematic analysis
   of data centers using this approach will identify the major contributors
   to wasteful energy practices including premature mixing of hot and cold
   air streams. In this study, a numerical model was developed for
   estimation of the data center airspace exergy destruction following the
   three-dimensional CFD simulation of room airspace. A second exergy
   destruction model available in the literature was implemented as well.
   Both models were tested on one simplified case with available analytical
   solution. They were then utilized to estimate the airspace exergy
   destruction in an existing research data center. Both approaches proved
   to be adequate, although the one proposed in this work presented
   significant sensitivity to numerical inaccuracies compared to the second
   model, even leading to zones of artificial negative exergy destruction.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can improve the net power consumption
   of electronic packages by generating power from the chip waste heat. In
   this study, a 3D computational model of electronic package with silicon
   nanowire (Si-NW) based embedded TEGs has been developed and the effect
   of crucial geometric parameters, contact resistances and thermal
   properties such as pitch length and length of Si-NWs, the electrical
   contact resistivity at Si-NW interface, thermal contact resistivity at
   TEG-package interface, and filling material thermal-conductivity on
   power generation has been evaluated. The analysis has shown how
   modifying some crucial parameters from their current values in different
   experimental studies affect power generation, e.g., decreasing the pitch
   length from 400 nm to 200 nm double the power generation, increasing the
   Si-NW length from 1 mu m to 8 mu m increases power generation by a
   factor of three and decreasing contact resistivity by one order of
   magnitude from 1.0x10(-11) Omega-m(2) enhances the power generation by a
   factor of two. This study has estimated the energy conversion efficiency
   of 0.02 \% for 8 mu m long Si-NWs using the best thermo-electric

   analysis provides insights into the crucial parameters of Si-NW TEGs

Abstract = {{The associated location information is crucial for the data collected by
   wireless sensor newtworks (WSNs), and nodes have to locate themselves
   when they are deployed randomly. The radio interferometric positioning
   system (RIPS) provides high accuracy at low-complexity, which is
   suitable for cost-limited nodes in WSNs. In the RIPS, two transmitters
   transmit sinusoids at slightly different frequencies, and the received
   signal is squared to achieve a low-frequency differential signal at the
   receivers. The phase difference of the low-frequency differential
   signals at two receivers is estimated to achieve a range metric called
   the Q-range, which is a linear combination of distances among four
   nodes. The squaring operation, however, increases the noise power that
   degrades the range-estimation performance, and also the Q-range
   estimator with the traditional RIPS receivers consists of the
   approximation error. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the RIPS
   receiver employing the undersampling techniques (RIPSu) that directly
   samples the received signal. By avoiding the squaring operation, the
   RIPS-u can achieve high accuracy and obtain the Q-range estimate without
   approximation. We provide the MATLAB simulation results to confirm the
   effectiveness of our proposed RIPS-u.}},

Abstract = {{Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithm has been adopted as a lattice
   reduction (LR) technique for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   detection to improve error performance without exponential complexity.
   However, implementing the LLL algorithm is still challenging. During the
   execution of each LLL iteration, the column swap operations may not
   happen in some cases, which is not efficient in terms of convergence
   speed. To address this issue, some greedy LLL variants have recently
   been proposed, which only select the iterations with column swap each
   time so that the number of LLL iterations can be reduced compared to the
   original LLL algorithm. In this paper, we propose an efficient greedy
   LLL algorithm, based on the relaxed Lovasz condition to search the
   candidate set of LLL iterations and the relaxed decrease of LLL
   potential to select an LLL iteration each time. Besides, we also present
   an efficient implementation of the proposed algorithm. Compared to the
   existing greedy LLL algorithms, simulations show that the proposed
   greedy LLL not only converges faster but also exhibits much lower
   complexity (save over 55\% and 62\% complexity in average for 4 x 4 and
   8 x 8 MIMO systems) while maintaining similar error performance in
   LR-aided MIMO detectors.}},

   the MU-MIMO system into parallel single user (SU-) MIMO systems using
   existing multiuser interference elimination methods (e.g., block
   diagonalization, generalized zero forcing channel inversion), and then
   for each user, we formulate a transceiver optimization problem in
   lattice-reduced domain with the goal of minimizing sum of the MSEs of
   information symbols. The problem is solved sub-optimally with the help
   of lattice reduction algorithm for each user. We compare the error
   performance and complexity of our proposed design with several existing

Abstract = {{Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) technology has become mature, and
   adopted in modern wireless systems. With multiple antennas at both
   transmitter and receiver, system data rate and throughput are greatly
   improved. Meanwhile, lattice reduction (LR)-aided detection has emerged
   as a promising scheme for signal detection in MIMO systems because of
   its low complexity and high performance. But in reality, channels
   between different antenna pairs are likely to be correlated, which
   impacts system capacity and performance. In this paper, the effect of
   spatial correlation on the performance and complexity of LR-aided
   detectors in MIMO systems is examined. Incorporating Kronecker model,
   first, we prove the diversity orders collected by LR-aided detectors
   over correlated MIMO channels; next, we measure their performance
   degradation through the parameter SNR gap when both transmit and receive
   correlation are present, and show that LR-aided detectors are more
   robust to spatial correlation compared to linear and SIC detectors;
   lastly, we study the effect of spatial correlation on the complexity of
   LR algorithm, and demonstrate through simulations that receive
   correlation affects LR-aided detectors more in terms of complexity
   compared to transmit correlation when MIMO size and correlation
   coefficient are large.}},

Abstract = {{The tactical edge (battlefields, disaster relief operations, etc.)is an
   ideal domain for utilizing mobile devices for computation. However,
   these situations require jobs to complete in a timely manner.
   Efficiently offloading computation can ensure timely job completion, but
   access to cloud computing infrastructure is typically limited,
   unreliable, or unavailable. As an alternative, we propose using
   vehicle-mounted high performance computers, called Tactical EIPCs
   (T-HPCs), as offload targets. A common scenario includes multiple
   offload targets with different computation capabilities, multiple
   clients wanting to offload computations, and wireless ad-hoc
   connectivity. While offloading strategies exist, currently none address
   the requirements of task scheduling in this setting. This paper presents
   an algorithm for offloading tasks from multiple sources while taking
   into account the computation capabilities and current utilization of
   available offload targets. In addition, distributed scheduling avoids a
   single point of failure which could be disastrous on the tactical edge.
   We report the results of simulations showing that our method reduces job
   completion time compared to alternative offloading schemes.}},

   of their reliabilities. Unlike many schemes, where packet collisions are
   treated as errors and ignored, the FC in the proposed scheme can
   partially retrieve the observations from collisions. As a result, the FC

   center (FC) has a limited time to collect binary local decisions, which
   are sent through a shared transmission channel. Assume that the
   allocated collection time is not large enough to collect the local
   decisions from all sensor nodes. The considered distributed detection
   applies a sensor-selection strategy called the reliability-based
   splitting algorithm to collect the local decisions. By using this
   strategy, the sensor nodes are divided into groups according to their
   observation reliabilities. The sensor nodes in the same group will
   compete for packet transmissions with each other by exploiting slotted
   ALOHA. In addition, we propose a modified algorithm called the two-level
   reliability-based splitting algorithm, where the sensor nodes are
   divided into groups based on both observation reliabilities and local
   decisions. Unlike other distributed detection with random-access
   protocols, where the packet collisions are treated as errors and

Abstract = {{Visible light communications (VLC) rely on white light emitting diodes
   (LEDs) to transmit information and provide illumination. White LEDs act
   as low pass filters and thus place a limitation on achievable data rates

   applied to VLC to best make use of the available modulation bandwidth
   through bit loading. However, VLC-OFDM waveforms exhibit high
   peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This drawback makes VLC-OFDM signals
   very sensitive to nonlinearity of LEDs and requires large biasing. We
   propose an iterative clipping method to reduce upper PAPR and lower PAPR
   of oversampled VLC-OFDM signals without introducing in-band distortions.
   Theoretical analysis of PAPRs distributions, and simulations of PAPR

Abstract = {{The centralized hierarchical control strategy has recently drawn much
   attention from researchers in the microgrid area. Primary control deals
   with power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). Secondary control
   is responsible for restoring the voltage and frequency back to their
   nominal values. However, there are two factors that presently limit the
   implementation of existing hierarchical control in a microgrid. First,
   the accuracy of reactive power sharing is low due to the difference in
   each DG's terminal voltage. Second, centralized high-bandwidth
   communication infrastructure is required, which is expensive and
   fragile, especially with high penetration of DGs. This paper presents a
   distributed cooperative control framework, which not only regulate the
   voltage at the critical bus, but also realize accurate reactive power
   sharing among DGs, using sparse communication with significantly lower
   bandwidth requirement. The proposed method is adaptive to network
   topology changes which supports the plug-and-play feature of microgrid.
   Performance of the proposed control is demonstrated through simulation
   results on a 4-bus microgrid testbed.}},

Abstract = {{With rising adoption of solar energy, it is increasingly important for
   utilities to easily assess potential interconnections of photovoltaic
   (PV) systems. In this analysis, we show the maximum feeder voltage due
   to various PV interconnections and provide visualizations of the PV
   impact to the distribution system. We investigate the locational
   dependence of PV hosting capacity by examining the impact of PV system
   size on these voltages with regard to PV distance and resistance to the
   substation. We look at the effect of increasing system size on line
   loading and feeder violations. The magnitude of feeder load is also
   considered as an independent variable with repeated analyses to
   determine the effect on the PV impact analysis. A technique is presented
   to determine and visualize the maximum capacity for possible PV
   installations for distribution feeders.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) have been in use in power
   systems for some time. Small penetrations of FACTS have been limited to
   special applications. Investment into low-cost power electronics based
   power routers has the potential to allow power routers to play a more
   prominent role in power systems. Part of this role would be to serve as
   dynamically dispatchable control to further optimize a power system's
   state. Power routers' expanded role will add a new dimension to
   transmission expansion, due to the ability of the power router to
   dynamically change transfer capabilities of the transmission system.
   Building a transmission line will no longer be the only option for
   system planners looking to expand, because they will now be able to
   utilize available capacity in parallel branches by installing a power
   router. This paper will compare the economic benefit of adding power
   flow routers to building a transmission line as a means of transmission
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers optimal control of dynamical systems which are
   represented by nonlinear stochastic differential equations. It is
   well-known that the optimal control policy for this problem can be
   obtained as a function of a value function that satisfies a nonlinear
   partial differential equation, namely, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
   equation. This nonlinear PDE must be solved backwards in time, and this
   computation is intractable for large scale systems. Under certain
   assumptions, and after applying a logarithmic transformation, an
   alternative characterization of the optimal policy can be given in terms
   of a path integral. Path Integral (PI) based control methods have
   recently been shown to provide elegant solutions to a broad class of
   stochastic optimal control problems. One of the implementation
   challenges with this formalism is the computation of the expectation of
   a cost functional over the trajectories of the unforced dynamics.
   Computing such expectation over trajectories that are sampled uniformly
   may induce numerical instabilities due to the exponentiation of the
   cost. Therefore, sampling of low-cost trajectories is essential for the
   practical implementation of PI-based methods. In this paper, we use
   incremental sampling-based algorithms to sample useful trajectories from
   the unforced system dynamics, and make a novel connection between
   Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) and information-theoretic
   stochastic optimal control. We show the results from the numerical
   implementation of the proposed approach to several examples.}},

Abstract = {{General anesthesia is required for patients undergoing surgery as well
   as for some patients in the intensive care units with acute respiratory
   distress syndrome. However, most anesthetics affect cardiac and
   respiratory functions. Hence, it is important to monitor and control the
   infusion of anesthetics to meet sedation requirements while keeping
   patient vital parameters within safe limits. The critical task of
   anesthesia administration also necessitates that drug dosing be optimal,
   patient specific, and robust. In this paper, the concept of
   reinforcement learning (RL) is used to develop a closed-loop anesthesia
   controller using the bispectral index (BIS) as a control variable while
   concurrently accounting for mean arterial pressure (MAP). In particular,
   the proposed framework uses these two parameters to control propofol
   infusion rates to regulate the BIS and MAP within a desired range.
   Specifically, a weighted combination of the error of the BIS and MAP
   signals is considered in the proposed RL algorithm. This reduces the
   computational complexity of the RL algorithm and consequently the
   controller processing time.}},

Abstract = {{A knowledge gap exists for how to improve hand rehabilitation after
   stroke using robotic rehabilitation methods, and non-robotic hand
   rehabilitation methods show only small patient improvements. A proposed
   solution for this knowledge gap is to integrate the strengths of three
   of the most favorable rehabilitation strategies for post-stroke
   rehabilitation of hand function, which are constraint-induced movement
   therapy (CIMT), high-intensity therapy, and repetitive task training,
   with a robotic rehabilitation gaming system. To create a system that is
   composed of collaborative therapy efforts, we must first understand how
   to encourage rehabilitation intervention motions. An experiment was
   conducted in which healthy participants were asked to complete six
   levels of a rehabilitation game, each level designed to encourage a
   specific therapeutic intervention, and a control, where participants
   were asked to complete undefined exercise motions. The results showed
   that participants' motions were significantly different than the control
   while playing each of the levels. Upon comparing the actual paths of
   participants to the paths encouraged by the levels, it was discovered
   that the participants followed the intended path while encouragement was
   being provided for them to do so. When the encouraged motions required
   quick, hard motions, the participants would follow an aliased version of
   the intended path. This study suggests that robotic rehabilitation
   systems can not only change how a participant moves, but also encourage
   specific motions designed to mimic therapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{For multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), time synchronization (TS)
   across distributed nodes is important. for certain applications (i.e.,
   surveillance, gunshot location system, etc.). In this paper, a method
   combining two forms of cooperative transmission (CT), digital-based
   Concurrent Cooperative Transmission (CCT) and analog-based
   Semi-Cooperative Spectrum Fusion (SCSF), is proposed and demonstrated to
   achieve fast and accurate time synchronization over large multihop WSNs.
   CCT, considered in many physical layer system studies and realistically
   demonstrated, enables range extension. Range extension implies that the
   source timestamp can be diffused to the network faster (i.e., in fewer
   hops) than non-CT-based TS protocols. SCSF is an analog CT method where
   different. cooperators transmit correlated information simultaneously.
   The two methods combine to create a new distributed method of network
   TS, called the Cooperative Analog and Digital (CANDI) TS protocol, which
   promises significantly shorter protocol time and smaller time errors in
   multi-hop networks. This paper presents the algorithm description, and
   physical layer simulations as well as network experimental results over
   a line network that show the performance advantage of CANDI over TPSN.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we revisit the problem of optimal tree-based routing
   structures for multicast in wireless multihop networks, but accounting
   for the impact of interference. Our analysis is based on the most
   accurate known interference model, namely the SINR-based physical
   interference model. We first study the problem in a low-intensity
   multicast scenario where we derive optimal node selection strategies for
   different sub tree structures. We then extend these analyses to account
   for interference between consecutive packets in higher-rate multicast
   scenarios. Based on these analyses, we propose and evaluate two new
   multicast routing structures: the interference-aware Steiner tree (LAST)
   algorithm, which requires global knowledge of node locations, and the
   fixed-distance tree merging (FTM) algorithm, which does not require
   global knowledge. We show that OUR proposed algorithms provide up to
   57\% reduction in schedule length and up to 41\% increase in goodput
   over existing tree-based routing structures.}},

Abstract = {{System combination (or data fusion(1)) is known to provide significant
   improvement for spoken term detection (STD). The key issue of the system
   combination is how to effectively fuse the various scores of participant
   systems. Currently, most system combination methods are system and
   keyword independent, i.e. they use the same arithmetic functions to
   combine scores for all keywords. Although such strategy improve keyword
   search performance, the improvement is limited. In this paper we first
   propose an arithmetic-based system combinat ion method to incorporate
   the system and keyword characteristics into the fusion procedure to
   enhance the effectiveness of system combination. The method incorporates
   a system-keyword dependent property, which is the number of acceptances
   in this paper, into the combination procedure. We then introduce a
   discriminative model to combine various useful system and keyword
   characteristics into a general framework. Improvements over standard
   baselines are observed on the Vietnamese data from IARPA Babel program
   with the NIST OpenKWS13 Evaluation setup.}},

Abstract = {{2.5D integration based on interposer technologies provides high density
   integration and high system bandwidth. Among many materials for the
   interposer substrate, glass could be a promising material since it

   stacked on the glass interposer, power distribution network impedance of
   2.5D IC must be estimated, analyzed and optimized since it directly
   affects chips performance and signal integrity. In this paper, we
   modeled 2.5D-power distribution network using a segmentation method and
   verified with 3D-EM simulation. With verified model, power distribution
   network impedance of 2.5D IC with glass interposer was estimated and
   analyzed. Also modeled 2.5D-power distribution network was optimized
   with decoupling capacitors. Optimization was based on the target
   impedance derived from the current spectrum of switching I/O. Target
   impedance based on the current spectrum allowed more flexible power

   services become ubiquitous, there is an increasing demand for proving
   service provenance management as a service. This paper describes
   ProvenanceLens, a two-tier service provenance management framework. The
   top tier is the service provenance capturing and storage subsystem and
   the next tier provides analysis and inference capabilities of service
   provenance data, which are value-added functionality for service health
   diagnosis and remedy. Both tiers are built based on the service
   provenance data model, an essential and core component of
   ProvenanceLens, which categorizes all service provenance data into three
   broad categories: basic provenance, composite provenance and application
   provenance. In addition, ProvenanceLens provides a suite of basic
   provenance operations, such as select, trace, aggregate. The basic
   provenance data is collected through a light-weight service provenance
   capturing subsystem that monitors service execution workflows, collects
   service profiling data, encapsulates service invocation dependencies.
   The composite and application provenance data are aggregated through a
   selection of provenance operations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
   ProvenanceLens using a real world educational service currently in
   operation for a dozen universities in China.}},

Abstract = {{While monitoring their own life support systems, underwater divers have
   to perform complex technical tasks in unstructured environments. An
   Underwater Robotic Assistant (UWRA) could assist a diver during the
   execution of these tasks by navigating the diver to the worksite,
   ferrying tools from the surface, and monitoring the diver's
   physiological responses. However, for the UWRA to be an asset to the
   diver and not a hindrance, it is proposed that the UWRA should interact
   with the diver similarly to how a human diver would interact with
   another human diver. In order to frame the human-robot interaction,
   Joint Intention Theory (JIT) was used to distinguish between planned and
   emergent coordination. Still, before JIT can be fully realized, the UWRA
   has to be capable of interpreting hand signals, recognizing equipment,
   and detecting the diver. In this paper, seven object-recognition
   algorithms, that do not require large sets of training data, are
   assessed for performance in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristic
   (ROC) plots and processing time using real-world data. It is shown that
   several of the template-based object recognition algorithms outperformed
   a state-of-the-art detector.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss a low-level sensor fusion method to combine
   datasets from a forward-looking acoustic sonar sensor and an optical
   camera mounted on an unmanned underwater vehicle. Landmark detection in
   an underwater environment with typical imaging sensors is prone to
   errors. Combining the strengths of multiple sensors through fusion
   allows more accurate detection of objects and landmarks. Objects
   detected in the sonar data are mapped directly into the camera image as
   an area of interest in which to search for landmarks. Calibration and
   cross-calibration of the sensors is presented along with the application
   of this sensor fusion algorithm on real-world data collected in an
   under-ice environment. A potential application for this type of sensor
   fusion is landmark detection and matching using point-features or
   histogram of gradients methods. Initial application of these landmark
   matching methods presented here show promise for increased performance
   of sensor-fusion methods over monocular camera only methods.}},

Abstract = {{Presented here is the initial hardware and software design of the Icefin
   autonomous underwater vehicle for use in under-ice missions in
   Antarctica. Exploration of the ocean beneath hundreds of meters of ice
   in Antarctica is a difficult task. However, many areas of science are
   interested in obtaining data from this environment and other similar
   environments including Jupiter's moon Europa. Deployment of an unmanned
   underwater vehicle to obtain data beneath Earth's ice shelves is much
   less dangerous and expensive than manned submarines or human diver
   deployments. However, the under-ice environment presents many unique
   challenges for an unmanned underwater vehicle including deployment
   through a small ice hole and extreme temperatures. The Icefin vehicle is
   designed as a modular, man portable, vertically deployed vehicle able to
   withstand the environmental challenges of the Polar Regions and the
   extreme depths required for the missions of interest. The Icefin has
   been designed with a full sensor suite to facilitate the necessary
   scientific data collection. The software suite used by the vehicle is
   designed around the MOOS middleware framework. This vehicle is slated to
   be deployed in Antarctica starting October 2014.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their lower complexity and better error performance over
   K-best detectors, lattice-reduction (LR)-aided K-best detectors have
   recently proposed for large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
   detection. Among existing LR-aided K-best detectors, complex LR-aided
   K-best detector is more attractive compared to its real counterpart due
   to its potential lower latency and resources. However, one main
   difficulty in hardware implementation of complex LR-aided K-best is to
   efficiently find top K children of each layer in complex domain. In this
   paper, we propose and implement an LR-aided K-best algorithm that
   efficiently finds top K children in each layer when K is relatively
   small. Our implementation results on Xilinx VC707 FPGA board show that,
   with the aid of LR, the proposed LR-aided K-best implementation can
   support 3 Gbps transmissions for 16x16 MIMO systems with 1024-QAM with
   about 2.7 dB loss to the maximum likelihood detector at bit-error rate

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology and inkjet-printed flexible electronics, sensor and power
   management (PMU) nodes fabricated on paper, plastic and other polymer
   substrates are introduced as a sustainable ultra-low-cost solution for
   the first paradigms of Internet of Things (IoT), ``Smart Skins{''} and
   ``Zero-Power{''} applications. The paper will cover examples from the
   state-of-the-art of fully integrated wireless sensor modules on paper or
   flexible polymers. We will demonstrate numerous 3D multilayer
   paper-based and LCP-based RF/Microwave Structures that include embedded
   energy harvesters and PMU's, that could potentially set the foundation
   for the truly convergent batteryless wireless Internet-of-Things
   networks of the future with enhanced cognitive intelligence and
   ``zero-power{''} operability through ambient energy harvesting. Examples
   from wearable (e.g. biomonitoring) antennas and RF modules will be
   reported, as well as the first integration of inkjet-printed
   nanotechnology-based (e.g. CNT, graphene) sensors on paper and organic
   substrates. The talk will close with a discussion about the challenges
   for inkjet-printed high-complexity modules as future directions in the
   area of environmentally-friendly ({''}green{''}) RF electronics and
   ``smart house{''} conformal IoT topologies.}},

Abstract = {{The most recent Global Burden of Disease study (Lim SS et al, Lancet
   380(9859): 2224-2260, 2012), for example, finds that combined exposure
   to ambient and indoor air pollution is one of the top five risks
   worldwide. Of particular concern is particulate matter (PM). Health
   researchers are now trying to assess how this mixture of air pollutants
   links to various health outcomes and how to tie the mixture components
   and health outcomes back to sources. This process involves the use of
   air quality models. As part of an EPA Clean Air Research Center, the
   Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE), a
   variety of air quality models are being developed and applied to provide
   enhanced temporal and spatial resolution of pollutant concentrations for
   use in epidemiologic analysis. Air quality models that are being further
   developed and used as part of the center include Bayesian-based ensemble
   methods and hybrid chemical transport-chemical mass balance modeling.
   The hybrid method uses knowledge of the emissions, modeling and
   measurement uncertainties, and can provide spatially and temporally
   complete pollutant fields.}},

Abstract = {{The growing availability of spatially resolved health data sets (i.e.,
   resident and county level patient records) requires spatially resolved
   exposure or air quality metrics to investigate the impact of air
   pollution on health outcomes. While daily air quality data are essential
   in time-series epidemiologic analysis, the spatial distribution of the
   observations is limited. Air pollution modeling (i.e., chemical
   transport modeling (CTM)) addresses this by producing spatially resolved
   air quality predictions using terrain, emissions and meteorology inputs.
   However, predicted concentrations may be biased. This work incorporates
   unique data fusion approaches to combine air quality observations from
   regulatory monitoring networks (OBS) with the output from a CTM (CMAQ)
   to generate spatially and temporally resolved gaseous and PMspecies
   concentrations. Species concentrations alone cannot directly identify
   emission sources or characterize pollutant mixtures, therefore source
   apportionment (SA) models are required to estimate source impacts. The
   focus of this work is a comparison of SA results for three U.S. regions
   with differing air pollution sources, St. Louis, Missouri; Atlanta,
   Georgia; and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.}},

Abstract = {{Health data geo-coded with residential coordinates are being used to
   investigate the relationship between ambient air quality and pediatric
   emergency department visits in the State of Georgia over the time period
   2000-2010. Two types of ambient air quality data - observed
   concentrations from ambient monitors and predicted concentrations from a
   chemical transport model (CMAQ) - are being fused to provide spatially
   resolved daily metrics of five air pollutant gases (CO, NO2, NOx, SO2
   and O-3) and seven airborne particulate matter measures (PM10, PM2.5,
   and PM2.5 constituents SO42-, NO3- , NH4+, EC, OC). The observational
   data provide reliable temporal trends at and near monitors, but limited
   spatial information due to the sparse monitoring network; CMAQ data, on
   the other hand, provide rich spatial information but less reliable
   temporal information. Four data fusion techniques were applied to
   provide daily spatial fields of ambient air pollutant concentrations,
   with data withholding used to evaluate model performance. Two of the
   data fusion methods were combined to provide results that minimized bias
   and maximized correlation over time and space with withheld data.
   Results vary widely across pollutants. These results provide health
   researchers with complete temporal and spatial air pollutant fields, as
   well as with temporal and spatial error estimate fields that can be
   incorporated into health risk models. Future work will apply these
   methods to five cities for use in ongoing air pollution health studies
   and to examine strategies for incorporating land use regression
   variables for spatial downscaling of data fusion results.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure assessment and development of control strategies are limited by
   the air pollutants measured and the spatial and temporal resolution of
   the observations. Air quality modeling can provide more comprehensive
   estimates of the temporal and spatial variation of pollutant
   concentrations, however with significant uncertainties. Source
   apportionment, which can be conducted as part of the air quality
   modeling, provides estimates of the impacts of sources on the mixtures
   of pollutants and contains surrogate estimates for pollutants that are
   not measured. This study details results using a novel spatiotemporal
   hybrid source apportionment method employed with interpolation
   techniques to quantify the impact of 33 PM2.5 source categories. The
   hybrid model, which aims to reduce estimating uncertainties, adjusts
   original source impact estimates from a chemical transport model at
   monitoring sites to closely reflect observed ambient concentrations of
   measured PM2.5 species. Daily source impacts are calculated for the
   contiguous U.S. Two interpolation methods are used to generate the data
   needed for spatiotemporal hybrid source apportionment. Hybrid adjustment
   factors are spatially interpolated using kriging, and daily observations
   are calculated by temporally interpolating available monitoring data.
   Methods are evaluated by comparing daily simulated
   concentrations-generated by reconstruction of source impact results-to
   observed species concentrations from monitors independent of model
   development. Results also elucidate U.S. regions with relatively higher
   impacts from specific sources. Monitoring data in this study originated
   from the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN), EPA-funded supersites, and
   the Southeastern Aerosol Research Characterization (SEARCH) Network.
   Results are to be used in health impact assessments.}},

   individual spacecraft in formation, with the intent to determine whether
   Leader Follower formations are error- or fuel-optimal. An formation
   optimal control problem is developed wherein formation slots and
   spacecraft barycenter weights are the formation control variables.
   Restricted formation control problems are presented which investigate
   the effect of controlling the individual spacecraft barycenter weights
   based on minimum Lyapunov formation error and also based on minimum fuel
   costs. It is shown that a Democratic formation works well with no
   a-priori knowledge of the formation state or orbit elements. Further,
   detailed simulation results suggest that Democratic formations tend to
   have lower overall fuel usage than strict Leader-Follower formations.

Abstract = {{Biomaterial-associated infections represent a significant clinical
   problem, and treatment of these microbial infections is becoming
   troublesome due to the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant
   strains. Here, we report a naturally functionalized bacterial
   polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHACOS) with antibacterial properties. We
   demonstrate that PHACOS selectively and efficiently inhibits the growth
   of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) both in vitro and
   in vivo. This ability has been ascribed to the functionalized side
   chains containing thioester groups. Significantly less (3.2-fold)
   biofilm formation of S. aureus was detected on PHACOS compared to
   biofilms formed on control poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate-co-hydroxyhexanoate)
   and poly(ethylene terephthalate), but no differences were observed in
   bacterial adhesion among these polymers. PHACOS elicited minimal
   cytotoxic and inflammatory effects on murine macrophages and supported
   normal fibroblast adhesion. In vivo fluorescence imaging demonstrated
   minimal inflammation and excellent antibacterial activity for PHACOS
   compared to controls in an in vivo model of implant-associated
   infection. Additionally, reductions in neutrophils and macrophages in
   the vicinity of sterile PHACOS compared to sterile PHO implant were
   observed by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, a similar percentage of
   inflammatory cells was found in the tissue surrounding sterile PHACOS
   and S. aureus pre-colonized PHACOS implants, and these levels were
   significantly lower than S. aureus pre-colonized control polymers. These
   findings support a contact active surface mode of antibacterial action
   for PHACOS and establish this functionalized polyhydroxyalkanoate as an
   infection-resistant biomaterial. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recently, millimeter wave (MMW) systems that operate at 60 GHz are
   proposed for the short-range communications to reduce the interference.
   Taking advantage of the spectrum characteristics of MMW bands, the
   indoor localization system using the radio interferometric positioning
   system (RIPS) employing space-time coding is proposed in this paper. The
   RIPS is a promising localization scheme for its low complexity and high
   accuracy, and the space-time RIPS (STRIPS) is the enhancement of the
   RIPS to work in MMW bands under the flat-fading channel. Two anchor
   nodes simultaneously transmit at two time slots with different
   frequencies, and the signal is sampled at the low-sampling frequency at
   the target node. The STRIPS achieve the range-difference (RD) estimate
   without approximation and is immune to channel fading effects. To
   accommodate the frequency offsets, the ESPRIT-based algorithm is
   adopted. Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented to confirm the
   performance of the STRIPS.}},

   for consolidated bioprocessing applications}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{First isolated in 1926, Clostridium thermocellum has recently received
   increased attention as a high utility candidate for use in consolidated
   bioprocessing (CBP) applications. These applications, which seek to
   process lignocellulosic biomass directly into useful products such as
   ethanol, are gaining traction as economically feasible routes toward the
   production of fuel and other high value chemical compounds as the
   shortcomings of fossil fuels become evident. This review evaluates C.
   thermocellum's role in this transitory process by highlighting recent
   discoveries relating to its genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and
   metabolomic responses to varying biomass sources, with a special
   emphasis placed on providing an overview of its unique, multivariate
   enzyme cellulosome complex and the role that this structure performs
   during biomass degradation. Both naturally evolved and genetically
   engineered strains are examined in light of their unique attributes and
   responses to various biomass treatment conditions, and the genetic tools
   that have been employed for their creation are presented. Several future
   routes for potential industrial usage are presented, and it is concluded
   that, although there have been many advances to significantly improve C.
   thermocellum's amenability to industrial use, several hurdles still
   remain to be overcome as this unique organism enjoys increased attention
   within the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{The Nintendo Wii Balance Board (WBB) is increasingly used as an
   inexpensive force plate for assessment of postural control; however, no
   documentation of force and COP accuracy and reliability is publicly
   available. Therefore, we performed a standard measurement uncertainty
   analysis on 3 lightly and 6 heavily used WBBs to provide future users
   with information about the repeatability and accuracy of the WBB force
   and COP measurements. Across WBBs, we found the total uncertainty of
   force measurements to be within +/- 9.1 N, and of COP location within
   +/- 4.1 mm. However, repeatability of a single measurement within a
   board was better (4.5 N, 1.5 mm), suggesting that the WBB is best used
   for relative measures using the same device, rather than absolute
   measurement across devices. Internally stored calibration values were
   comparable to those determined experimentally. Further, heavy wear did
   not significantly degrade performance. In combination with prior
   evaluation of WBB performance and published standards for measuring
   human balance, our study provides necessary information to evaluate the
   use of the WBB for analysis of human balance control. We suggest the WBB
   may be useful for low-resolution measurements, but should not be
   considered as a replacement for laboratory-grade force plates. Published

Abstract = {{The Georgia Institute of Technology Prox-1 mission will demonstrate
   automated trajectory control in low-Earth orbit relative to a deployed
   three-unit (3U) CubeSat, for an on-orbit inspection application. Passive
   thermal imaging provides the basis for an advanced relative navigation
   system to provide precise relative state estimation and control.
   Trajectory control is made possible through the use of an agile control
   moment gyro unit and a 1U hydrazine thruster. Automated maneuver
   planning and execution utilizes a guidance algorithm based on Artificial
   Potential Functions. This coupled with Prox-l's extensive control laws

Abstract = {{Many scientifically interesting sites at Mars have small-scale hazards
   that can pose a threat to landers and rovers. Hazard Detection and
   Avoidance (HDA) can be used during the terminal phase of flight to find
   and divert to a safe site. An algorithm has been developed that operates
   directly on a single flash lidar range image and is able to rapidly
   select a safe site in a computationally efficient manner. A flash lidar
   simulator is used to analyze the performance of the algorithm relative
   to the terrain and vehicle. The algorithm is able to select a safe site
   with confidence for terrains with rock abundances up to 35\% and slopes
   up to the capability of the selected rover (22). Variation in altitude,
   attitude, and lidar noise do not significantly affect the performance of
   the safe site selection. This hazard avoidance algorithm can decrease
   landing failures at all the landing sites listed in the Mars 2020
   Science Definition Report, and has the potential to operate at far more
   difficult sites.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction wheel pendulum is an underactuated electromechanical system
   consisting of a pendulum with an un-driven rotation axis at one end and
   a motor-driven wheel at the other end. Current flow in the motor induces
   a torque on the wheel and a corresponding reaction torque on the
   pendulum. This type of system has been studied by various researchers
   over the past decade, but in every case under the assumption that a
   brush-commutated permanent-magnet dc motor actuates the system. The
   purpose of this paper is to extend prior work by actuating the system
   instead with a brushless three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous ac
   motor. A systematic approach to modeling and control is pursued for the
   problem of balancing at the inverted equilibrium. Both state-feedback
   and output-feedback controllers are designed on the basis of a
   reduced-order model, and the designs are compared through simulation and
   analysis. Linear quadratic optimization is used to obtain both regulator
   and estimator gains, and a loop transfer recovery procedure is used so
   that the loop gain of the output-feedback design approximates that of
   the state-feedback design.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become a potential candidate
   for medium/high-power applications including high-voltage direct current
   (HVDC) transmission, adjustable speed drive, and static var compensation
   systems. One of the technical challenges associated with the control of
   an MMC is the choice of pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy along with
   a submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing algorithm without imposing
   high computational burden on the controller and/or unnecessary switching
   transitions among the SMs. This paper proposes a distributed PWM
   strategy with an improved SM capacitor voltage balancing algorithm which
   aims at reducing the computational burden of the controller, the
   electro-magnetic interference and the switching frequency. The validity
   of the proposed PWM strategy and the SM capacitor voltage balancing
   algorithm is confirmed by simulation and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid electric vehicle powertrains, especially those based on the
   power-split architecture, are complex dynamic systems that must be
   modeled in a systematic way in order to fully exploit an organized
   approach to control design. Much of the existing literature focuses on a
   high-level treatment of the modeling topic, typically emphasizing
   steady-state behavior. The present paper is motivated by the need for a
   general approach to lower-level dynamic modeling that can be applied for
   analysis, control and simulation of vehicles that feature the
   power-split architecture. A dynamic model and an associated integral
   controller are first developed in symbolic form. The resulting general
   formulation is then specialized in order to perform numerical
   simulations. Particular attention is devoted to an orderly method for
   computing controller feedback gains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generalized space vector modulation (SVM) method
   for any modular multilevel converter (MMC). The proposed SVM method
   produces the maximum level number (i.e., 2n+1, where n is the number of
   submodules in the upper or lower arm of each phase) of the output phase
   voltages and a higher equivalent switching frequency than other
   modulation methods, which consequently leads to reduced harmonics in the
   output voltages and currents. Compared with earlier modulation methods
   for MMCs, the proposed SVM method provides two more degrees of freedom,
   i.e., the redundant switching sequences and the adjustable duty cycles,
   thus offering significant flexibility for optimizing the circulating
   current suppression and capacitor voltage balancing. This SVM method is
   a useful tool for further studies of MMCs, as it can be conveniently
   extended for any control objectives. The demonstrated results validate
   the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular automata (CA) approach for modeling wave propagation in
   elastic media presented by Georgia Tech researchers is very promising.
   The software package (JCA for Java cellular automata) they developed to
   simulate the wave propagation, takes a mesh file, runs a simulation, and
   outputs results. However, the processing time for large mesh file is
   extremely high. CUDA assisted parallel processing of finite element
   method (FEM) shows potential to analyze wave propagation in
   computational solid mechanics. In this work, we propose GPU assisted CA
   approach for computing elastodynamic response on different fields. The
   elastodynamic CA method is discontinuous like FEM and thus accurately
   captures propagating wave fronts. The CA technique lends itself to
   parallelization because there is no need to store a large sparse matrix.
   Experiments show that for 26K mesh size and 10000 iterations, GPU
   assisted solution gains speed up more than 573x over the JCA
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of Chen-Fliess series is first introduced which depends on
   the input and delayed versions of the input. It is then shown how a
   class of analytic differential delay systems with a single delay and
   constant initial conditions has input-output maps representable in terms
   of this new functional series. As in the classical case, the
   coefficients can be computed by iterated Lie derivatives, but here the
   method is applied to an infinite dimensional embedding of the original
   state space system. Finally, the more technical issue of series
   convergence is addressed. Sufficient conditions are produced to
   guarantee convergence in both a local and global sense.}},

Abstract = {{A sparse parameter estimation method is proposed for identifying a
   stochastic monomolecular biochemical reaction network system.
   Identification of a reaction network can be achieved by estimating a
   sparse parameter matrix containing the reaction network structure and
   kinetics information. Stochastic dynamics of a biochemical reaction
   network system is usually modeled by a chemical master equation, which
   is composed of several ordinary differential equations describing the
   time evolution of probability distributions for all possible states.
   This paper considers closed monomolecular reaction systems for which an
   exact analytical solution of the corresponding chemical master equation
   is available. The estimation method presented in this paper incorporates
   the closed-form solution into a regularized maximum likelihood
   estimation (MLE) for which model complexity is penalized, whereas most
   of existing studies on sparse reaction network identification use
   deterministic models for regularized least-square estimation. A
   simulation result is provided to verify performance improvement of the
   presented regularized MLE over the least squares (LSE) based on a
   deterministic mass-average model in the case of a small population size.
   Improved reaction structure detection is achieved by adding a penalty
   term for l(1) regularization to the exact maximum likelihood function.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is conducted during the midterm stage of a NSF-funded project
   based on a test case of urban neighborhood environment {[}1]. It
   explores how a geographic-based information system can be applied to
   designing an algae-powered housing environment at the level of an urban
   neighborhood, in which the algae system is taken as a design
   intervention to promote energy performance and carbon reduction of the
   urban system. A Geodesign model is suggested for managing the coupled
   system that integrates algae cultivation and urban systems as ``design
   for change{''}. By extending the system boundary from a closed algae
   cultivation system to an open neighborhood-scale urban environment, the
   design of a new close loop network configuration contributes to the
   increase of energy performance and biofuel production and the reduction
   of fossil fuel consumption, waste stream flow and the carbon emissions
   of the urban system.
   The proposed Geodesign framework informs six stages of process for the
   coupled system: the objective model to set the goalasthe ``Net-zero{''}
   neighborhood;the representational model to collect and organize data;the
   performance model to measurethe energy, biomass, waste stream and water
   flows;the scenario model to propose possible future paths at different
   spatial scales;the evaluation model to reexamine the performance of the
   newly designed coupled system; and the decision making model to make
   choices. The sixstages are then applied to a preliminary test case of
   four sites along an urban-rural gradient in Atlanta.This paper concludes
   with design and planning parameters for designing an ecological urban
   district in accordance with the scientific knowledge and technical
   criteria for algal biofuel production and sustainable urban living. (C)

Abstract = {{The response of cylindrical composite structures subjected to underwater
   impulsive loads is analyzed. The analysis focuses on the effect of
   varying structural attributes and material properties on load-carrying
   capacity, deflection, energy dissipation and damage. The structural
   designs studied are monolithic composite structures, and sandwich
   structures with foam cores of different relative densities and different
   radii. Underwater impulsive loads are generated using a novel
   experimental setup, and deflection and core compression are
   characterized using highspeed digital imaging. The experiments are
   supported by fully dynamic 3D numerical calculations which account for
   fluid-structure interactions and damage and failure mechanisms in the
   materials. For the same applied impulse, the monolithic cylindrical
   sections experience significant warping, delamination and cracking,
   while sandwich structures experience significantly lower damage. In
   sandwich structures, as the core density increases, the transmitted
   impulse and overall damage also increase. Deflection and warping in the
   impulsively loaded region are influenced by the radius of curvature and
   material orientation. Results show that cylindrical sandwich structures
   have superior blast-resistance than cylindrical monolithic structures of
   equal mass with only relatively minor increases in wall thickness. The
   experiments, computations and structure-performance relations offer
   approaches for improving the blast mitigation capabilities of
   cylindrical composite sections in critical parts of a ship structure
   like the keel, hull and pipes. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{There is a great need to identify high-performance nanoporous materials
   for gas storage, separation and catalysis to solve a wide range of
   industrially relevant challenges. Molecular simulations have become an
   important complement to experiments in the screening and selection of
   suitable porous materials. Successful implementation of molecular
   simulations requires accurate force fields (FFs) to describe the
   interactions of guest molecules with porous frameworks. However,
   developing accurate and transferable FFs for porous materials can be
   extremely challenging. While generic FFs and experimentally-derived FFs
   work well for many simple systems, they often fail to describe
   interactions in more complex porous materials. Since first-principles
   quantum mechanical (QM) approaches are capable of accurately predicting
   intermolecular interactions, deriving FFs from QM data without
   experimental input is a promising solution. In this paper, we review
   recent developments in deriving first-principles FFs for molecules in a
   variety of nanoporous materials. We summarize and classify the
   methodologies used in these studies, and discuss the factors that are
   responsible for the accuracy and reliability of FFs. Finally, we
   conclude the review with a discussion of current challenges and future
   directions for this rapidly growing field.}},

Abstract = {{The iridescent metallic green beetle, Chrysina gloriosa, selectively
   reflects left circularly polarized light, and exhibits iridescence. The
   exoskeleton of C. gloriosa is decorated by a polygonal texture:
   hexagonal cells (similar to 10 micron) coexist with pentagons and
   heptagons. We find that the fraction of pentagons and heptagons computed
   using Voronoi analysis increase with an increase in curvature, implying
   that it is energetically favorable to create disordered patterns for
   higher curvature surfaces. In bright field microscopy, each cell
   contains a bright yellow core, placed in a greenish cell with yellowish
   border, but the size of the core and spatial distribution of color
   changes when the angle of incoming incident light is varied. Using
   confocal microscopy, we observe that these cells consist of nearly
   concentric, nested arcs that lie on surface of a shallow cone. We infer
   that the patterns are structurally and optically analogous to the focal
   conic domains formed spontaneously on the free surface of a cholesteric
   liquid crystal. In this paper, we describe in detail how the
   microstructure referred to as Bouligand structure provides the basis for
   the morphogenesis, and for generating the intricate optical response of
   the exoskeleton of the beetle. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Betweenness Centrality is a widely used graph analytic that has
   applications such as finding influential people in social networks,
   analyzing power grids, and studying protein interactions. However, its
   complexity makes its exact computation infeasible for large graphs of
   interest. Furthermore, networks tend to change over time, invalidating
   previously calculated results and encouraging new analyses regarding how
   centrality metrics vary with time.
   While GPUs have dominated regular, structured application domains, their
   high memory throughput and massive parallelism has made them a suitable
   target architecture for irregular, unstructured applications as well. In
   this paper we compare and contrast two GPU implementations of an
   algorithm for dynamic betweenness centrality. We show that typical
   network updates affect the centrality scores of a surprisingly small
   subset of the total number of vertices in the graph. By efficiently
   mapping threads to units of work we achieve up to a 110x speedup over a
   CPU implementation of the algorithm and can update the analytic 45x
   faster on average than a static recomputation on the GPU.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic reactive power control of doubly fed induction generators
   (DFIGs) plays a crucially important role in maintaining transient
   stability of power systems with high penetration of DFIG based wind
   generation. Based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), this paper
   proposes an optimal adaptive supplementary reactive power controller for
   DFIGs. By augmenting a corrective regulation signal to the reactive
   power command of rotor-side converter (RSC) of a DFIG, the supplementary
   controller is designed to reduce voltage sag at the point of common
   connection (PCC) during a fault, and to mitigate output active power
   oscillation of the wind farm after a fault. As a result, the transient
   stability of both DFIG and the power grid is enhanced. An action
   dependent cost function is introduced to provide real-time online ADP
   learning control. Furthermore, a policy iteration algorithm using
   high-efficiency least square method is employed to train the
   supplementary controller in an online model-free manner. By using such
   techniques, the supplementary reactive power controller is endowed with
   capability of online optimization and adaptation. Simulations carried
   out on a benchmark power system integrating a large DFIG wind farm show
   that the ADP based supplementary reactive power controller can
   significantly improve the transient system stability in changing
   operation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a load monitoring technique
   proposed to be used in today's residential energy auditor. It is
   expected to automatically provide the information of the type, energy
   consumption, and operation status of the electric loads without getting
   access to the loads. However, there still not exists any commercialized
   product so far, mainly because of the extraordinary large load sets
   comparing with the limited learning data. The fast emerging of new types
   of loads further aggravates the problem. This paper proposes an adaptive
   non-intrusive load identification model to address this problem. The
   proposed model is not dedicated to identify all the loads around the
   world, but it will grasp knowledge from samples that are not identified
   in the real application, and gradually form a new learning procedure so
   as to identify more and more new samples correctly. Random forest
   algorithm is introduced here to realize the objective and a case study
   is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Sequest is a fully sequential procedure that delivers improved point and
   confidence-interval (CI) estimators for a designated steady-state
   quantile by exploiting a combination of ideas from batching and
   sectioning. Sequest incorporates effective methods to do the following:
   (a) eliminate bias in the sectioning-based point estimator that is
   caused by initialization of the simulation or an inadequate simulation
   run length (sample size); and (b) adjust the CI half-length for the
   effects of skewness or correlation in the batching-based point
   estimators of the designated quantile. Sequest delivers a CI designed to
   satisfy user-specified requirements concerning both the CI's coverage
   probability and its absolute or relative precision. We found that
   Sequest exhibited good small-and large-sample properties in a
   preliminary evaluation of the procedure's performance on a suite of test

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing availability of data and wider use of analytics,
   the ingredients for increased reliance on modeling and simulation are
   now present. Tremendous progress has been made in the field of modeling
   and simulation over the last six decades. Software and methodologies
   have advanced greatly. In the area of weather, future-casts based on
   model predictions have become highly accurate and heavily relied upon.
   This is happening in other domains, as well. In a similar vein, drivers
   may come to rely upon future-casts of traffic that are based on
   predictions from models fed by sensor data. The need for and the
   capabilities of simulation have never been greater. This panel will
   examine the future of research in modeling and simulation by (1)
   examining prior progress, (2) pointing out current weaknesses and
   limitations, (3) highlighting directions for future research, and (4)
   discussing support for research including funding opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a data structure that stores previously observed vehicle
   paths in a given area in order to predict the forward trajectory of an
   observed vehicle at any stage. Incomplete vehicle trajectories are
   conditioned against in a Past Tree, to predict future trajectories in
   another tree structure-a Future Tree. Many use cases in transportation
   simulation benefit from higher validity by considering historical paths
   in determining how to route vehicle entities. Instead of assigning
   static and independent turn probabilities at intersections, the storage
   and retrieval of historical path information can give a more accurate
   picture of future traffic trends and enhance the capabilities of
   real-time simulations to, say, inform mobile phone users of expected
   traffic jams along certain segments, direct the search efforts of law
   enforcement personnel, or allow more effective synchronization of
   traffic signals.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed simulations provide a powerful framework for utilizing a
   greater amount of computing resources, but require that consideration be
   taken to ensure that the results of these simulations match results that
   would have been produced by a single sequential resource. Also,
   synchronization among the multiple nodes must also occur to ensure that
   events processed in the simulation maintain a timestamped order across
   all nodes. This work uses the popular network simulator ns-3. The ns-3
   simulator is a discrete event network simulator used for educational and
   research-oriented purposes which provides two implementation options for
   distributed simulations based on the null message and granted time
   window algorithms. We examine the performance of both distributed
   schedulers available in ns-3 in an effort to gauge specific features of
   an overall distributed network topology that warrant the use of one
   synchronization method over the other.}},

   improve the computational efficiency, we further develop a two-timescale

   intervals, state and observable variables are random intervals, and
   interval-valued Gaussian distributions model the noises. The prediction

Abstract = {{Patient-specific computational study of aortic disease provides a
   powerful means for diagnosis and pre-operative planning. However,
   creating patient-specific computational models can be time-consuming due
   to the fact that anatomical geometries extracted from clinical imaging
   data are often incomplete and noisy. This paper presents an approach for
   constructing statistical shape models (SSMs) for aortic surfaces with
   the eventual goal of mapping the mean aorta geometries to raw surface
   data obtained from the clinical images for each new patient so that
   patient-specific models can be automatically constructed.
   The input aortic models in this study come in the form of triangle
   meshes generated from CT scans on 6 patients. Statistical models with
   modes that characterize the variation pattern are found after optimizing
   the group-wise correspondence across the aorta training set. We use the
   direct reparametrization approach to efficiently manipulate shape
   correspondence. We use B-spline based differentiable shape
   representation for the training set and use the adjoint method for
   deriving analytical graclients in a gradient based approach for
   manipulating the shape correspondence to minimize the description length
   of the resulting SSM. Our numerical result shows that the evaluation
   measures of the optimized statistical model have been significantly
   enhanced.}},

   proposed to find the geometrical and material effective properties of

   method to estimate effective mechanical properties of lattice material

Abstract = {{Reliable simulation protocols supporting integrated computational
   materials engineering requires uncertainty to be quantified. In general,
   two types of uncertainties are recognized. Aleatory uncertainty is
   inherent randomness, whereas epistemic uncertainty is due to lack of
   knowledge. Aleatory and epistemic uncertainties need to be
   differentiated in validating multiscale models, where measurement data
   for unconventionally very small or large systems are scarce, or vary
   greatly in forms and quality (i.e. sources of epistemic uncertainty). In
   this paper, a recently proposed generalized hidden Markov model is used
   for cross-scale and cross-domain information fusion under the two types
   of uncertainties. The dependency relationships among the observable and
   hidden state variables at multiple scales and physical domains are
   captured using generalized interval probability. The update of imprecise
   credence and model validation are based on a generalized interval Bayes'
   rule. Its application in molecular dynamics simulation for irradiation
   of Fe is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a formal, mathematically rigorous, value-based approach
   to system design has been proposed within the systems engineering
   community. This approach stands in contrast to the traditional
   requirements based approach to system design because of its foundations
   in decision theory. One of the crucial first steps in the value-based
   approach is the elicitation of information about all the elements that
   influence a design or acquisition decisions, namely, all actors, system
   properties and behavior, preferences, and concerns. This elicitation
   step requires a formalized, model-based method for capturing these
   elements of the value network, the basis of the decision maker's value
   function. In this paper, we examine previous work in the area of
   elicitation in system design and define a set of elements necessary to
   effectively elicit a meaningful value network. We then consider a
   domain-specific profile as an extension of SysML to formally capture the
   essential elements of a value network. To illustrate the modeling
   approach, the profile is applied to a case study of the design of a
   heads-up display system (iHUD) in order to test the depth of the profile
   as well as to show the value of the model based approach in the
   elicitation process.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of user-generated content related to consumer products
   continues to grow as users increasingly take advantage of forums,
   product review sites, and social media platforms. The content is a
   promising source of insight into users' needs and experiences. However,
   the challenge remains as to how concise and useful insights can be
   extracted from large quantities of unstructured data. We propose a
   visualization tool which allows designers to quickly and intuitively
   sift through large amounts of user-generated content and derive useful
   insights regarding users' perceptions of product features. The tool
   leverages machine learning algorithms to automate labor-intensive
   portions of the process, and no manual labeling is required by the
   designer. Language processing techniques are arranged in a novel way to
   guide the designer in selecting the appropriate inputs, and
   multidimensional scaling enables presentation of the results in concise
   2D plots. To demonstrate the efficacy of the tool, a case study is
   performed on action cameras. Product reviews from Amazon.com are
   analyzed as the user-generated content. Results from the case study show
   that the tool is helpful in condensing large amounts of user-generated
   content into useful insights, such as the key differentiations that
   users perceive among similar products.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-scale materials modeling, it is desirable that different levels
   of details can be specified in different regions of interest without the
   separation of scales so that the geometric and physical properties of
   materials can be designed and characterized. Existing materials modeling
   approaches focus on the representation of the distributions of material
   compositions captured from images. In this paper, a multi-scale
   materials modeling method is proposed to support interactive
   specification and visualization of material microstructures at multiple
   levels of details, where designer's intent at multiple scales is
   captured. This method provides a feature-based modeling approach based
   on a recently developed surfacelet basis. It has the capability to
   support seamless zoom-in and zoom-out. The modeling, operation, and
   elucidation of materials are realized in both the surfacelet space and

   improving the threshold value for the selective phase shift operator in
   Grover rotation. In this paper, a hybrid approach that combines
   continuous-time quantum walks with Grover search is proposed. By taking
   advantage of quantum tunneling effect, local barriers are overcome and
   better threshold values can be found at the early stage of search
   process. The new algorithm based on the formalism is demonstrated with
   benchmark examples of global optimization. The results between the new

Abstract = {{Solar power systems are becoming increasingly popular due to the fact
   that solar power can offer time and money saving solutions for off-grid
   and grid-connected homes, cabins, and businesses with clean and
   affordable energy. However, there are still significant opportunities to
   reduce the cost of solar power systems by optimizing system design. We
   employ system modeling and simulation methods to compare a commercial
   rooftop solar system with a new concept for the same application, namely
   Mega Module system. In order to accomplish this, a solar power system's
   lifecycle is divided into three phases, namely manufacturing,
   installation, and maintenance. Specifically, a SysML-based conceptual
   model was first constructed, based on which, Arena simulation models
   were built for three phases of the two systems. Then, we performed input
   analysis on data collected onsite for the two systems, and output
   analysis of the theoretical seconds/watt of all three phases based on
   reasonable assumptions. The results of the simulation study indicate
   that although it increases the manufacturing time, the Mega Module
   system saves a significant amount of time in the installation phase and
   a relatively small amount of time in the maintenance phase, and thus can
   be more cost-effective in the long term. The case study further
   demonstrates the feasibility and potential to reduce costs of
   product-service systems by quick installation and optimization using
   system modeling and simulation methods.}},

Abstract = {{Modern day systems often require reconfigurability in the operating
   parameters of the transmit and receive antennas, such as the resonant
   frequency, radiation pattern, impedance, or polarization. In this work a
   novel approach to antenna reconfigurability is presented by integrating
   antennas with the ancient art of origami. The proposed antenna consists
   of an inkjet printed center-fed spiral antenna, which is designed to
   resonate at 1.0GHz and have a reconfigurable radiation pattern while
   maintaining the 1.0GHz resonance with little variation in input
   impedance. When flat, the antenna is a planar spiral exhibiting a
   bidirectional radiation pattern. By a telescoping action, the antenna
   can be reconfigured into a conical spiral with a directional pattern and
   higher gain, which gives the antenna a large front-to-back ratio.
   Construction of the antenna in this manner allows for a simple,
   lightweight, transportable antenna that can expand to specifications in
   the field.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically inspired design is the process of using biological systems
   as analogues to develop innovative solutions for engineering problems.
   This paper describes an effective and successful implementation of
   problem-driven biologically inspired design in a real-world problem. In
   support of the Department of Energy SunShot Initiative, a national
   collaborative effort to make solar energy cost-competitive with other
   forms of electricity by the end of the decade, solar panel designs were
   carried out by engineering and architectural design teams. Solar
   Photovoltaic (PV) systems were developed using analogical design, and
   more specifically, bio-inspired design. Some systems were also designed
   using non-biological analogues. Functional decompositions were employed
   as the first step in the design process, as a way to identify the key
   functions essential to the system's reliability and cost effectiveness.
   Six key functions were identified. Analysis of the final designs by the
   teams showed,that the solar panel system designs using biologically
   inspired analogues were more effective in meeting the six key functions
   identified during functional decomposition. Employing a combination of
   divergent and convergent design thinking is also discussed as a way for
   effective biologically inspired design. The top three designs selected
   for prototyping were biologically inspired and exceeded the project goal
   of reducing the installation and labor costs of solar PV systems by
   50\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the acoustic scattering is determined from a finite
   phononic crystal through an implementation of the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff
   integral theorem. The approach employs the Bloch theorem applied to a
   semi-infinite phononic crystal (PC) half-space. The internal pressure
   field of the half-space, subject to an incident acoustic monochromatic
   plane wave, is formulated as an expansion of the Bloch wave modes. Modal
   coefficients of reflected (diffracted) plane waves are arrived at via
   boundary condition considerations on the PC interface. Next, the PC
   inter facial pressure, as determined by the Bloch wave expansion (BWE),
   is employed along with the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral equation to
   compute the scattered pressure from a large finite PC. Under a short
   wavelength limit approximation (wavelength much smaller than finite PC
   dimensions), the integral approach is employed to calculate the
   scattered pressure field for a large PC subject to an incident wave with
   two distinct incident angles. In two dimensions we demonstrate good
   agreement of scattered pressure results of large finite PC when compared
   against detailed finite element calculations. The work here demonstrates
   an efficient and accurate uniform computational framework for modeling
   the scattered and internal pressure fields of a large finite phononic
   crystal.}},

Abstract = {{The harvesting of ambient vibrations for powering wireless electronic
   components has been heavily researched over the last decade. As long as
   sufficient vibrational energy is readily available in the neighborhood
   of small electronic devices, it is possible to achieve
   mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion by means of a proper
   transduction mechanism and thereby enable self-powered wireless
   electronic systems. An alternative scenario is the case in which the
   wireless electronic component has little or no vibrational energy
   available in its environment, yet wireless charging of its battery is
   still of great interest. Examples to this scenario range from medical
   implants to underwater sensor networks. The goal in such systems is to
   charge the electronic component by contactless transfer of energy
   without relying on mechanical or electrical connection to the wireless
   component. The commonly used transduction methods of wireless energy
   transfer are known to be inductive, capacitive, far-field
   electromagnetic, and optical coupling. Acoustic energy transfer based on
   the propagation of energy at ultrasonic frequencies is a recently
   explored alternative. As this field receives growing attention, it is
   required to develop fully coupled modeling framework to quantify the
   energy transfer characteristics with a focus on the transmitter,
   receiver, fluid medium, as well as geometric and material parameters. In
   this paper, we present multiphysics modeling of contactless ultrasonic
   energy transfer for wireless electronic components submerged in liquid
   medium. The source is a pulsating sphere and the receiver is a
   piezoelectric transducer operating in the 33-mode of piezoelectricity
   with fundamental underwater resonance frequency above the audible
   frequency range. The goal is to quantify the electrical power
   transmitted from the source to the electrical load across the electrodes
   of the receiver in terms of the source strength for a given distance
   between the transmitter and the receiver. Both analytical and
   finite-element models are developed for the resulting acoustic
   piezoelectric structure interaction problem. Fixed-free and free-free
   mechanical boundary conditions are considered for the fluid loaded
   receiver to validate the analytical model against multiphysics
   finite-element simulations. For the electrical boundary conditions
   across the electrodes, resistive and resistive-inductive loads are
   considered. Specifically broadband power transfer is achieved by optimal
   resistive inductive load tuning for performance enhancement. Effects of
   various system parameters on the electroelastic response are explored.
   The analytical model developed in this work can be used to predict and
   optimize the multiphysical system dynamics with very good accuracy
   and.substantially improved computational efficiency as compared to
   finite-element modeling using commercial packages.}},

Abstract = {{Barriers to effective screening and management of NCDs in
   resource-constrained regions include limited availability of trained
   personnel, access to affordable automatic medical devices, and
   longitudinal clinical data. We present an end-to-end mHealth system
   which takes advantage of the almost universal availability of
   smartphones in order to address these barriers in a scalable and
   affordable manner. Our system includes simple, low-cost (\$5-\$20) and
   open-source peripherals that allow a minimally trained person to collect
   high-quality medical data at the point-of-care through a standard
   smartphone; allows the reliable transmission of clinical data even in
   the case of high-latency network connections; stores data in a
   cloud-based system, making patient records accessible anywhere; and
   enables both crowdsourced diagnostics and generation of annotated data
   for the research and development of automatic decision support and risk
   assessment systems. We show examples of the different elements of the
   system tailored for the management of cardiovascular disease and chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, which includes prototypes of the low-cost
   peripherals. In a validation study (of 40 volunteers), our
   smartphone-based blood pressure (BP) monitor was shown to measure BP,
   heart rate and respiration rate with a mean-absolute-error of less than
   5 units from the reference values for 80\% of the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the mechanisms and consequences of plastic
   strain localizations exhibited in tensile stress-strain behaviors,
   fracture and fatigue. A broad overview is first presented, including
   important practical considerations and historical background; then
   dislocation mechanics based details are developed in subsequent
   sections. Material characterizations are portrayed beginning from the
   macroscopic and extending down to the critical nanoscale. Controlling
   influences of temperature, strain rate, grain size and deformation mode
   on strain localization are evaluated. Relations are established between
   otherwise apparently disparate variations in phenomena, materials,
   applied conditions, and size scales. Strengths and weaknesses of various
   model descriptions of material behaviors are discussed in light of
   experimental evidence and suggestions are put forward for further
   research into promising model approaches and for areas where new
   approaches appear to be needed. A paradigm is suggested for the
   development of improvements in understanding based on the needed
   evolution of ever-increasingly precise experimental results, accurate
   theoretical model descriptions and incorporation of this information
   into the rapidly progressing development of numerical/computer modelling
   of real material behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Learning Bayesian networks is NP-hard. Even with recent progress in
   heuristic and parallel algorithms, modeling capabilities still fall
   short of the scale of the problems encountered. In this paper, we
   present a massively parallel method for Bayesian network structure
   learning, and demonstrate its capability by constructing genome-scale
   gene networks of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana from over 168.5
   million gene expression values. We report strong scaling efficiency of
   75\% and demonstrate scaling to 1.57 million cores of the Tianhe-2
   supercomputer. Our results constitute three and five orders of magnitude
   increase over previously published results in the scale of data analyzed
   and computations performed, respectively. We achieve this through
   algorithmic innovations, using efficient techniques to distribute work
   across all compute nodes, all available processors and coprocessors on
   each node, all available threads on each processor and coprocessor, and
   vectorization techniques to maximize single thread performance.}},

Abstract = {{Graphs that model social networks, numerical simulations, and the
   structure of the Internet are enormous and cannot be manually inspected.
   A popular metric used to analyze these networks is betweenness
   centrality, which has applications in community detection, power grid
   contingency analysis, and the study of the human brain. However, these
   analyses come with a high computational cost that prevents the
   examination of large graphs of interest.
   Prior GPU implementations suffer from large local data structures and
   inefficient graph traversals that limit scalability and performance.
   Here we present several hybrid GPU implementations, providing good
   performance on graphs of arbitrary structure rather than just scale-free
   graphs as was done previously. We achieve up to 13x speedup on
   high-diameter graphs and an average of 2.71x speedup overall over the
   best existing GPU algorithm. We observe near linear speedup and
   performance exceeding tens of GTEPS when running betweenness centrality
   on 192 GPUs.}},

Title = {{Flow-dependent regulation of genome-wide mRNA and microRNA expression in
   endothelial cells in vivo}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC DATA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in arterial regions exposed to
   disturbed blood flow (d-flow), in part, due to alterations in gene
   expression in the endothelium. While numerous in vitro studies have
   shown how anti-atherogenic flow and pro-atherogenic flow differently
   regulate gene expression of cultured endothelial cells, similar in vivo
   studies have been scarce. Recently, we developed a mouse model of
   atherosclerosis that rapidly develops robust atherosclerosis by
   partially ligating the left carotid artery (LCA) branches, while using
   the contralateral right carotid (RCA) as control. We also developed a
   novel method to collect endothelial-enriched RNAs from the carotids of
   these animals, which enabled us to perform genome-wide expression
   analyses of mRNAs and miRNAs in the arterial endothelium exposed to
   either d-flow or s-flow. These microarray results were used to identify
   novel mechanosensitive genes such as DNA methyltransferase-1 and miR-712
   that play key roles in atherosclerosis. Here, we report these
   endothelial mRNA and miRNA expression profiles with in-depth information
   on experimental procedures along with an example of usage of these data.}},

Abstract = {{The success of condition-based-maintenance (CBM) of mechanical
   components, in terms of cost and reliability, hinges closely on the
   ability to accurately estimate the remaining life of the components at
   point. In the case of rotary machineries, special attention for
   remaining life estimation is warranted in view of the dynamic behaviors
   associated with repetitive contact motions. This paper discusses the
   rotary machinery prognostics using rolling element bearing - one of the
   foremost causes of breakdown in rotary machinery - as an example to
   illustrate the treatments of self-leaning prediction of remaining life.
   To date bearing remaining life prediction issue has not been fully
   addressed, as a result of the highly random nature of the bearing defect
   growth behavior in fatigue cycles. This paper addresses the lack of
   current bearing condition monitoring techniques by proposing a remaining
   life adaptation methodology based on the approaches of mechanistic
   modeling of vibration and self-training of parameter adaptation, thus
   the instantaneous rate of defect propagation can be apprehended, even
   when the initial health condition is unknown and the defect growth
   behavior is time-varying, to deliver a reliable prediction of the
   remaining life. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   contact. The effect of real contact area on several statistical measures
   of the sliding process is investigated. Scale-independent behavior is
   observed in the slip sequence size distribution, similar to OFC results,

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{57-66}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Waviness is invariably present in vertically-aligned Carbon Nanotubes
   (CNTs) regardless of how controlled the fabrication process is. This
   study, using experiments and models, shows that such inherent waviness
   is the main mechanism by which the effective modulus of CNTs is reduced
   by several orders of magnitude. At this time, most studies have shown
   that the compliant mechanical response of the CNT forests under
   compressive loading is due to bending and buckling of CNTs as well as
   the variation of CNT density throughout. the forest height. Subjecting
   CNT forests to tensile loads as well as to compressive loads, it is
   shown here that the high compliance of CNT forests is due to the
   inherent waviness of individual CNTs, and not necessarily due to bending
   and buckling of CNTs. The experimental findings are also supported
   through analytical models and numerical models that show that the
   CNTwavy geometry causes the CNTs to have 4-5 orders of magnitude greater
   compliance than a straight CNT. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Presently, there are numerous applications for non-destructive
   techniques like emission tomography, laser based methods and particle
   image velocimetry that are used to study flame characteristics.
   Reconstruction of the flame intensity field using emission tomography
   has the advantage over other technologies that it gives accurate results
   but at the same time requires relatively inexpensive equipment, and
   therefore, has numerous industrial applications. In the present paper, a
   new algorithm performing Direct-3D reconstruction using the maximization
   of entropy (MENT) methodology has been introduced. Through detailed
   studies using a mathematical object, it has been shown that the
   Direct-3D algorithm shows significantly reduced errors as compared to 2D
   slice-by-slice reconstruction algorithms. Secondly, the major features
   of the proposed algorithm, for e.g., effect of orientation, effect of
   number of views, and robustness have been discussed. Finally, a few
   qualitative results from actual flames have been presented using a
   candle and a gas fired burner, and the results match well with the
   actual flame geometry and intensity distribution. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{A comprehensive multi-phase combustion model has been developed to study
   the physiochemical processes involved in the combustion of ammonium
   dinitramide (ADN). The numerical model is based on the conservation
   equations of mass, species concentration, and energy, and takes into
   account finite-rate chemical kinetics in both condensed and gas phases.
   Based on an extensive review of the literature on ADN thermal
   decomposition, three global decomposition reactions in the condensed
   phase of ADN are included. A detailed chemical kinetics scheme involving
   34 species and 165 reactions is employed in the gas phase. Detailed
   combustion-wave structures and burning rate characteristics of ADN are
   described. The optimized gas-phase kinetics mechanism was able to
   predict the multi-stage flame structure. Good agreements between the
   predicted and measured profiles of temperature and species mole
   fractions were obtained at different pressures. Reasonable agreements
   between calculated and measured values of propellant burning rates and
   surface temperatures were obtained over a broad range of pressure from
   0.7 to 350 atm. The burning rate increases with pressure, except in the
   mid range of similar to 60-100 atm. The coupled condensed- and gas-phase
   analysis employed in the current model is able to capture this
   irregular/unstable combustion behavior in the mid range, where the
   burning rate decreases with the increase in pressure. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Experimental techniques using thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) are
   presented to characterize static damage initiation and progression in
   fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) single lap shear joints. Two carbon fiber
   composite lap joint systems are tested: woven (fabric) laminated and
   uni-tape laminated orthotropic plates. The resin layer used for the
   bonded lap-joints is the FM300K adhesive with an approximate thickness
   of 10 mils. Two testing methods are studied with TSA to detect damage
   and characterize damage severity. Several samples are removed from
   loading after initial cracking is suspected from observing the TSA data,
   and micrographic inspection is conducted to characterize and confirm the
   nature of their failure initiation. The proposed TSA testing schemes
   along with a damage index demonstrate a good ability to detect damage
   near the bonded edge of the joint and characterize damage severity. The
   damage index presented provides a distinct advantage over traditional
   methods such as contact gauges and acoustic emission which are unable to
   link detected events to the damage extent. The demonstrated TSA ability
   to characterize damage in lap joints is well suited for long-term
   fatigue tests or comparing the mechanical performance of various FRP
   joints. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{524-529}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The thermal and mechanical behaviors of bent GaN nanowires are
   investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The nanowires
   considered have an axial orientation along the {[}0001] crystalline
   direction and hexagonal cross sections with diameters of 2.91 and 3.55
   nm. A phase transformation from wurtzite to a tetragonal structure
   occurs near the surfaces of the nanowires in the bending process. The
   thermal conductivity is evaluated using an analytical model. This model
   is based on the same atomistic potential used in the MD calculations and
   uses configurational information from the MD calculations as input. The
   method is 50 times more computationally efficient compared with the
   Green-Kubo method. It is found that the thermal conductivity decreases
   by 35\% and 25\%, respectively, for nanowires 2.91 and 3.55 nm in
   diameter during the phase transformation in the bending process. In
   contrast, the thermal conductivity does not change during unloading and
   is found to be independent of the bending angle. The overall trend in
   thermal and mechanical responses of the nanowire with a diameter of 3.55
   nm is similar to that for the nanowire with a diameter of 2.91 nm.
   Results also show that the phase transformation due to bending cannot be
   reversed by simple unloading. The finding points out a mechanism for
   altering the structure and thermal conductivity of GaN nanowires through
   transverse mechanical loading. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{438-447}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Productively reusing the waste residuals from energy production is an
   essential component in sustainable disposal and management of energy
   related waste. In the US, the world's second largest producer of coal
   next to China, over 118 million tons of coal combustion by-products are
   produced each year; only 44\% of which are productively reused. In
   recent decades, advances in lowering CO2, SOX, and NOX emissions from
   coal combustion have changed the characteristics of the solid coal
   combustion products. In particular, the residual carbon content of fly
   ash generated at many US coalfired power plants has increased, and has
   become more heterogeneous. Additionally, utilities are exploring the use
   of pure biomass as a fuel source, which results in a fly ash that is
   generated from a purely organic source. While much research effort has
   been devoted to understanding the properties and potential productive
   reuse alternatives for coal combustion products, relatively little
   research has been done on the byproducts from biomass combustion or
   co-combustion.
   In this study, high carbon content coal ash, co-fired coal/biomass ash,
   and pure biomass ash from several US power plants were investigated. The
   ashes were characterized using a number of physical and chemical
   analysis techniques, including: scanning electron microscopy, laser
   diffraction, organic carbon content, nitrogen adsorption surface area,
   proximate and ultimate, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction
   analysis. Results showed little physical, chemical, and mineralogical
   differentiation between coal ash and coal co-fired with biomass ash.
   However, the pure biomass ashes investigated in this study, showed
   significantly lower specific gravity, and primary oxide content, as well
   as coarser particle size distribution, higher residual carbon, higher
   heating value, and much higher specific surface area, when compared to
   the coal and co-fired ashes. These results have important implications
   on the potential for productive reuse of these waste materials. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This letter presents a regression-based speech enhancement framework
   using deep neural networks (DNNs) with a multiple-layer deep

   context was found to improve the continuity of speech to be separated
   from the background noises successfully without the annoying musical
   artifact commonly observed in conventional speech enhancement
   algorithms. A series of pilot experiments were conducted under
   multi-condition training with more than 100 hours of simulated speech
   data, resulting in a good generalization capability even in mismatched
   testing conditions. When compared with the logarithmic minimum mean
   square error approach, the proposed DNN-based algorithm tends to achieve
   significant improvements in terms of various objective quality measures.
   Furthermore, in a subjective preference evaluation with 10 listeners,
   76.35\% of the subjects were found to prefer DNN-based enhanced speech

Abstract = {{Motivated by the interest to increase production throughputs of
   immersion lithography machines, wafers are scanned at increasingly high
   velocities and accelerations, which may result in liquid loss at the
   receding contact line. The dynamic characteristics of the immersion
   fluid with free boundary play an important role for fluid management
   system, and are concerned in various potential immersion unit designs.
   To offer intuitive insights into the dynamic effects of the immersion
   fluid due to scan speeds, a lumped-parameter model based on

Abstract = {{In the analysis of resonant microwave circuits by the method of moments
   (MoM), we typically subdivide the surface in terms of cell density
   determined by the smallest wavelength and compute the response at
   several frequencies using this single mesh. Although interpolation can
   be used in frequency, this approach typically involves matrix operations
   of complexity O (kN3) at the k discrete frequencies of MoM computation,
   and can become prohibitive for large structures. In this article, we
   develop an order-recursive method for solving the linear system, wherein
   the solution at the higher frequencies is iteratively constructed from
   the LU decomposition at the lower frequencies without having to solve
   the linear system from scratch at each frequency. The proposed
   order-recursive MoM allows for systematic adaptive gridding with the
   increase in frequency, and results in a large portion of matrix
   recomputation to be avoided, potentially enabling significant reduction
   in computation time and memory. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title = {{A generalized interval probability-based optimization method for
   training generalized hidden Markov model}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{319-329}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recently a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) was proposed for
   solving the information fusion problems under aleatory and epistemic
   uncertainties in engineering application. In GHMM, aleatory uncertainty
   is captured by the probability measure whereas epistemic uncertainty is
   modeled by generalized interval. In this paper, the problem of how to
   train the GHMM with a small amount of observation data is studied. An
   optimization method as a generalization of the Baum-Welch algorithm is
   proposed. With a generalized Baum-Welch's auxiliary function and the
   Jensen inequality based on generalized interval, the GHMM parameters are
   estimated and updated by the lower and upper bounds of observation
   sequences. A set of training and re-estimation formulas are developed.
   With a multiple observation expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the
   training method guarantees the local maxima of the lower and the upper
   bounds. Two case studies of recognizing the tool wear and cutting states
   in manufacturing is described to demonstrate the proposed method. The
   results show that the optimized GHMM has a good recognition performance.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for developing a control oriented
   analytical linear model of a turbofan engine at both equilibrium and
   nonequilibrium conditions. This scheme provides improved accuracy over
   the commonly used linearization method based on numerical perturbation
   and piecewise linear interpolation. Linear coefficients are obtained by
   evaluating at current conditions analytical expressions, which result
   from differentiation of simplified nonlinear expressions.
   Residualization of the fast dynamics states are utilized since the fast
   dynamics are outside of the primary control bandwidth. Analytical
   expressions based on the physics of the aerothermodynamic processes of a
   gas turbine engine facilitate a systematic approach to the analysis and
   synthesis of model based controllers. In addition, the use of analytical
   expressions reduces the computational effort, enabling linearization in
   real time at both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions to enable
   more accurate capture of system dynamics during aggressive transient
   maneuvers. The methodology is formulated and applied to a separate flow
   twin spool turbofan engine model in the numerical propulsion system
   simulation (NPSS) platform. The derived linear model is validated
   against the full nonlinear engine model.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Minimum Connected Dominating Sets (MCDSs) are used as virtual backbones
   for efficient routing and broadcasting in wireless networks extensively.
   However, the MCDS problem is NP-Complete even in Unit Disk Graphs.
   Therefore, many heuristic-based approximation algorithms have been
   proposed recently. In these approaches, networks are deterministic where
   two nodes are assumed either connected or disconnected. In most real
   applications, however, there are many intermittently connected wireless
   links called lossy links, which only provide probabilistic connectivity.
   For wireless networks with lossy links, we propose a Probabilistic
   Network Model (PNM). Under this model, we measure the quality of
   Connected Dominating Sets (CDSs) using CDS reliability defined as the
   minimum upper limit of the node-to-node delivery ratio between any pair
   of dominators in a CDS. We attempt to construct a MCDS while its
   reliability is above a preset application-specified threshold sigma,
   called sigma-Reliable MCDS (sigma-RMCDS). We claim that constructing a
   sigma-RMCDS is NP-Hard under the PNM model. We propose a novel Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) with immigrants schemes called RMCDS-GA to solve the
   sigma-RMCDS problem. To evaluate the performance of RMCDS-GA, we conduct
   comprehensive simulations. The simulation results show that compared
   with the traditional MCDS algorithms, RMCDS-GA can construct a more
   reliable CDS without increasing the size of a CDS.}},

Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{138-147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Long duration human spaceflight poses challenges for spacecraft autonomy
   and the regeneration of life support consumables, such as oxygen and
   water. Bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS), which make use of
   biological processes to transform biological byproducts back into
   consumables, have the ability to recycle organic byproducts and are the
   preferred option for food production. A limitation in BLSS research is
   in the nonavailability of small-scale experimental capacities that may
   help to better understand the challenges in system closure, integration,
   and control. Ground-based aquatic habitats are an option for small-scale
   research relevant to bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS), given
   that they can operate as self-contained systems enclosing a habitat
   composed of various species in a single volume of water. The purpose of
   this paper is to present the modeling and simulation of a reconfigurable
   aquatic habitat for experiments in regenerative life support automation;
   it supports the use of aquatic habitats as a small-scale approach to
   experiments relevant to larger-scale regenerative life support systems.
   It presents ground-based aquatic habitats as an option for small-scale
   BLSS research focusing on the process of respiration, and elaborates on
   the description of biological processes by introducing models of
   ecophysiological phenomena for consumers and producers: higher plants of
   the species Bacopa monnieri produce O-2 for snails of the genus Pomacea;
   the snails consume O-2 and generate CO2, which is used by the plants in
   combination with radiant energy to generate O-2 through the process of
   photosynthesis. Feedback controllers are designed to regulate the
   concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water. This paper expands the
   description of biological processes by introducing models of
   ecophysiological phenomena of the organisms involved. The model of the
   plants includes a description of the rate of CO2 assimilation as a
   function of irradiance. Simulations and validation runs with hardware
   show how these phenomena may act as disturbances to the control
   mechanisms that maintain safe concentration levels of dissolved oxygen
   in the habitat. (c) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The diffusion media (DM) has been shown to be a vital component for
   performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The DM has a
   dual-layer structure composed of a macro-substrate referred to as the
   gas diffusion layer (GDL) coated with a micro-porous layer (MPL).
   Efficient prediction of the effective transport properties of the DM
   from its internal structure is essential to optimizing the
   multifunctional characteristics of this critical component. In this
   work, a unique data-driven approach to establishing structure-property
   correlations is introduced and applied to the case of gas diffusion in
   the GDL and MPL This new approach provides an automated process to
   produce unbiased estimators to microstructural variance, in contrast to
   many process-related (hence biased) parameters employed by prominent
   correlations in the field. The present approach starts with a rigorous
   quantification of microstructure in the form of n-point statistics. It
   is followed by the identification of the key aspects of the internal
   structure through the use of principle component analysis. A data-driven
   correlation is established when the principal components are related to
   effective diffusivity by multivariate linear regression. This
   data-driven approach is compared to the conventional correlations and
   shown to achieve a very high accuracy for capturing the diffusive
   transport in the tested PEFC components. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Laser welding of NiTi shape memory alloy: Comparison of the similar and
   dissimilar joints to AISI 304 stainless steel}},
Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{151-158}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The unique properties of NiTi alloy, such as its shape memory effect,
   super-elasticity and biocompatibility, make it ideal material for
   various applications such as aerospace, micro-electronics and medical
   device. In order to meet the requirement of increasing applications,
   great attention has been given to joining of this material to itself and
   to other materials during past few years. Laser welding has been known
   as a suitable joining technique for NiTi shape memory alloy. Hence, in
   this work, a comparative study on laser welding of NiTi wire to itself
   and to AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel wire has been made.
   Microstructures, mechanical properties and fracture morphologies of the
   laser joints were investigated using optical microscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray
   diffraction analysis (XRD), Vickers microhardness (HV0.2) and tensile
   testing techniques. The results showed that the NiTi-NiTi laser joint
   reached about 63\% of the ultimate tensile strength of the as-received
   NiTi wire (i.e. 835 MPa) with rupture strain of about 16\%. This joint
   also enabled the possibility to benefit from the pseudo-elastic
   properties of the NiTi component. However, tensile strength and
   ductility decreased significantly after dissimilar laser welding of NiTi
   to stainless steel due to the formation of brittle intermetallic
   compounds in the weld zone during laser welding. Therefore, a suitable
   modification process is required for improvement of the joint properties
   of the dissimilar welded wires. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We previously identified 3-hydroxypyridine-2-thione (3HPT) as a novel
   zinc binding group for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Early
   structure activity relationship (SAR) studies led to various small

   HDAC8 but devoid of HDAC1 inhibition. To delineate further the depth of
   the SAR of 3HPT-derived HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), we have extended the
   SAR studies to include the linker region and the surface recognition
   group to optimize the HDAC inhibition. The current efforts resulted in
   the identification of two lead compounds, 10d and 14e, with potent HDAC6
   and HDAC8 activities that are inactive against HDAC1. These new HDACi
   possess anticancer activities against various cancer cell lines
   including Jurkat J.gamma 1 for which SAHA and the previously disclosed
   3HPT-derived HDACi were inactive.}},

   were found to be highly stable over hundreds of thousands of cycles and
   could be reversibly charged/discharged at scan rates between 500 mV/s

   exhibit leakage currents and self-discharge rates that are comparable to
   state of the art electrochemical double-layer ESCs. Using an IL as

   ESCs by 60\%, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in the energy density

   (MWCNT)-polydimethylsiloxane-poly(methyl methacrylate) by near edge
   X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Effects of adding
   nanofillers of different sizes were addressed. Despite observed
   morphological variations and inhomogeneous carbon nanotube distribution,
   spun mats appeared homogeneous under NEXAFS analysis. Spectra revealed
   differences in emissions from glancing and normal spectra, which may
   evidence phase separation within the bulk of the micrometer-size fibers.
   Further, dichroic ratios show polymer chains did not align, even in the
   presence of nanofillers. Addition of nanofillers affected emissions in
   the C-H, C=O, and C-C regimes, suggesting their involvement in
   interfacial matrix-carbon nanotube bonding. Spectral differences at
   glancing angles between pristine and composite mats suggest that
   geometric conformational configurations are taking place between
   polymeric chains and carbon nanotubes. These differences appear to be
   carbon nanotube-dimension dependent and are promoted upon room
   temperature mixing and shear flow during electrospinning. CH-pi bonding
   between polymer chains and graphitic walls, as well as H-bonds between
   impurities in the as-grown MWCNTs and polymer pendant groups are
   proposed bonding mechanisms promoting matrix conformation.}},

Abstract = {{We study the role of amplifier saturation in eliminating feedback noise
   in self-sustained oscillators. We extend previous works that use a
   saturated amplifier to quench fluctuations in the feedback magnitude,
   while simultaneously tuning the oscillator to an operating point at
   which the resonator nonlinearity cancels fluctuations in the feedback
   phase. We consider a generalized model which features an
   amplitude-dependent amplifier gain function. This allows us to determine
   the total oscillator phase noise in realistic configurations due to
   noise in both quadratures of the feedback, and to show that it is not
   necessary to drive the resonator to large oscillation amplitudes in
   order to eliminate noise in the phase of the feedback.}},

Abstract = {{A simple material platform for advanced cell migration studies is
   presented. It relies on surfaces modified with photo-activatable
   adhesion peptides and two light exposure steps to independently trigger
   attachment and migration. The light-controlled exposure of adhesive
   ligands allows precise and selective control over integrin-mediated
   adhesion and migration events, including their dynamic variation. By
   using a microscope-coupled scanning laser, user-defined geometry, size
   and composition of the adhesion and migration spaces are possible and
   simply defined by the laser scanning parameters. Time lapse and high
   resolution microscopy are possible during the complete process. The
   miniaturization capabilities of this assay also allow (i) parallel or
   sequential migration experiments and controls on the same view field of
   the microscope, (ii) migration studies in confined and unconventional
   geometries or (iii) activation of migration spaces at subcellular
   resolution, all of these with minimum material and time consumption. The
   photo-activatable surfaces will allow studies of the dynamics of
   integrin-dependent migration processes with unprecedented flexibility,
   multiplexing, reproducibility, and spatiotemporal resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Tri-isopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS)-functionalized polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules incorporate structural components of
   graphene nanoribbons and represent a family of model molecules that form
   organic crystal semiconductors for electronic devices. Here, we report a
   series of TIPS-functionalized PAHs and discuss their electronic
   properties and crystal packing features. We observe that these soluble
   compounds easily form one-dimensional (1D) packing arrangements and
   allow a direct evolution of the stacking by varying the geometric shape.
   We find that the aspect ratio between length and width plays an
   important role on crystal packing. Our result indicates that when the
   PAH molecules have zigzag edges, these can provide enough volume for the
   molecules to rotate and reorient, alleviating the unfavorable
   electrostatic interactions found in perfectly cofacial - stacking.
   Density functional theory calculations were carried out to provide
   insights into how the molecular geometric shape influences the
   electronic structure and transport properties. The calculations indicate
   that, among the compounds studied here, brick-layer stacks provide the
   highest hole mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Membranes utilizing nanoporous one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional
   (2D) materials are emerging as attractive candidates for applications in
   molecular separations and related areas. Such nanotubular and
   nanolayered materials include carbon nanotubes, metal oxide nanotubes,
   layered zeolites, porous layered oxides, layered aluminophosphates, and
   porous graphenes. By virtue of their unique shape, size, and structure,
   they possess transport properties that are advantageous for membrane and
   thin film applications. These materials also have very different
   chemistry from more conventional porous 3D materials, due to the
   existence of a large, chemically active, external surface area. This
   feature also necessitates the development of innovative strategies to
   process these materials into membranes and thin films with high
   performance. This work provides the first comprehensive review of this
   emerging area. We first discuss approaches for the synthesis and
   structural characterization of nanoporous 1D and 2D materials.
   Thereafter, we elucidate different approaches for fabrication of
   membranes and thin films from these materials, either as multiphase
   (composite/hybrid) or single-phase membranes. The influence of surface
   chemistry and processing techniques on the membrane morphology is
   highlighted. We then discuss the applications of such membranes in areas
   relating to molecular transport and separation, e.g gas and liquid-phase
   separations, water purification, and ion-conducting membranes. The
   review concludes with a discussion of the present outlook and some of
   the key scientific challenges to be addressed on the path to
   industrially applicable membranes containing nanoporous 1D and 2D
   materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monooxygenation is an important route of nitroaromatic compound (NAC)
   biodegradation and it is widely found for cometabolic transformations of
   NACs and other aromatic pollutants. We investigated the C and N isotope
   fractionation of nitrophenol monooxygenation to complement the
   characterization of NAC (bio)degradation pathways by compound-specific
   isotope analysis (CSIA). Because of the large diversity of enzymes
   catalyzing monooxygenations, we studied the combined C and N isotope
   fractionation and the corresponding C-13- and N-15-apparent kinetic
   isotope effects (AKIEs) of four nitrophenol-biodegrading microorganisms
   (Bacillus spharericus JS905, Pseudomonas sp. 1A, Arthrobacter sp. JS443,
   Pseudomonas putida B2) in the pH range 6.1-8.6 with resting cells and
   crude cell extracts. While the extent of C and N isotope fractionation
   and the AKIE-values varied considerably for the different organisms, the
   correlated C and N isotope signatures (delta N-15 vs delta C-13)
   revealed trends, indicative of two distinct monooxygenation pathways
   involving hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone or 1,2- and 1,4-benzoquinone
   intermediates, respectively. The distinction was possible based on
   larger secondary N-15-AKIEs associated with the benzoquinone pathway.
   Isotope fractionation was neither masked substantially by nitrophenol
   speciation nor transport across cell membranes. Only when 4-nitrophenol
   was biodegraded by Pseudomonas sp. 1A did isotope fractionation become
   negligible, presumably due to rate-limiting substrate binding steps
   pertinent to the catalytic cycle of flavin-dependent monooxygenases.}},

Abstract = {{A self-powered, piezotronic effect-enhanced glucose sensor based on
   metal-semiconductor-metal (M-S-M) structured single ZnO nanowire device
   is demonstrated. A triboelectrical nanogenerator (TENG) is integrated to
   build a self-powered glucose monitoring system (GMS) to realize the
   continuously monitoring of glucose concentrations. The performance of
   the glucose sensor is generally enhanced by the piezotronic effect when
   applying a -0.79\% compressive strain on the device, and magnitude of
   the output signal is increased by more than 200\%; the sensing
   resolution and sensitivity of sensors are improved by more than 200\%
   and 300\%, respectively. A theoretical model using energy band diagram
   is proposed to explain the observed results. This work demonstrates a
   promising approach to raise the sensitivity, improve the sensing
   resolution, and generally enhance the performance of glucose sensors,
   also providing a possible way to build up a self-powered GMS.}},

Abstract = {{Visible and UV light are demonstrated to significantly enhance the
   sensing properties of an n-type porous silicon (PS) extrinsic
   semiconductor interface to which TiO2 and titanium oxynitride (TiO2-xNx)
   photocatalytic nanostructures are fractionally deposited. The acid/base
   chemistry of NH3, a moderately strong base, and NO2, a moderately strong
   acid, couples to the majority charge carriers of the doped semiconductor
   as the strong acid (TiO2) enhances the extraction of electrons from NH3,
   and the more basic TiO2-xNx decreases the efficiency of electron
   extraction relative to the untreated interface. In contrast, NO2 and a
   TiO2 or TiO2-xNx nanostructure-decorated PS interface compete for the
   available electrons leading to a distinct time dependent electron
   transduction dynamics as a function of TiO2 and TiO2-xNx concentration.
   Only small concentrations of TiO2 and its oxynitride and no
   self-assembly are required to enhance the response of the decorated
   interface. With light intensities of less than a few
   lumens/cm(2)-sterad-nm, responses are enhanced by up to 150\% through
   interaction with visible (and UV) radiation. These light intensities
   should be compared to the sun's radiation level, approximate to 500
   lumens/cm(2)-sterad-nm suggesting the possibility of solar pumped
   sensors. The observed behavior in these systems is largely explained by
   the recently developed Inverse Hard/Soft Acid/Base (IHSAB) concept.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanocrystals with uniform sizes were synthesized in droplet
   microreactors through seed-mediated growth. The key to the success of
   this synthesis is the use of air as a carrier phase to generate the
   droplets. The air not only separates the reaction solution into droplets
   but also provides O-2 for the generation of reducing agent
   (glycolaldehyde). It also serves as a buffer space for the diffusion of
   NO, which is formed in situ due to the oxidative etching of Ag
   nanocrystals with twin defects. For the first time, we were able to
   generate Ag nanocrystals with controlled sizes and shapes in continuous
   production by using droplet microreactors. For Ag nanocubes, their edge
   lengths could be readily controlled in the range of 30-100 nm by varying
   the reaction time, the amount of seeds, and the concentration of AgNO3
   in the droplets. Furthermore, we demonstrated the synthesis of Ag
   octahedra in the droplet microreactors. We believe that the air-driven
   droplet generation device can be extended to other noble metals for the
   production of nanocrystals with controlled sizes and shapes.}},

Abstract = {{Double-ended tuning fork (DETF) strain gauges have potential
   applications in measuring a number of structural components, improving
   safety and reducing maintenance costs. Furthermore, their small size,
   high bandwidth, high shock tolerance, and extreme sensitivity make them
   useful for high performance applications. To demonstrate the potential
   of a DETF strain gauge, we bond silicon substrates with gauges to a
   modified automotive halfshaft, a component which is difficult to monitor
   due to its high stiffness and structural strength, enabling real-time
   monitoring of wheel conditions. Using a simple and rapid induction
   bonding process, we show for the first time a DETF strain gauge
   measuring strains of 1000 ilk, near the design limits of the testing
   apparatus. We also present for the first time system level temperature
   dependence data for a silicon gauge induction bonded to metal. Through a
   combination of analytical and computational models, we are able to
   predict the strain transfer through the substrate to the tuning fork. By
   using the insights from these models combined with the experimental data
   presented, this work can be extended to a number of different structural
   components, enabling highly sensitive, ubiquitous strain sensing
   networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the specificity of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase
   (CGTase) of Paenibacillus macerans towards maltose was improved by the
   site-saturation engineering of lysine 47, and the enzymatic synthesis of
   2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G) with L-ascorbic acid and
   maltose as substrates was optimized. Compared to the AA-2G yield of the
   wild-type CGTase, that of the mutants K47F (lysine -> phenylalanine),
   K47P (lysine -> proline), and K47Y (lysine -> tyrosine) was increased by
   17.1\%, 32.9\%, and 21.1\%, respectively. Under the optimal
   transformation conditions (pH 6.5, temperature 36 degrees C, the mass
   ratio of L-ascorbic acid to maltose 1:1), the highest AA-2G titer by the
   K47P reached 1.12 g/L, which was 1.32-fold of that (0.85 g/L) obtained
   by the wild-type CGTase. The reaction kinetics analysis confirmed the
   enhanced maltose specificity of the mutants K47F, K47P, and K47Y. It was
   also found that compared to the wild-type CGTase, the three mutants had
   relatively lower cyclization activities and higher disproportionation
   activities, which was favorable for AA-2G synthesis. As revealed by the
   interaction structure model of CGTase with substrate, the enhancement of
   maltose specificity may be due to the removal of hydrogen bonding
   interactions between the side chain of residue 47 and the sugar at -3

Title = {{Assessing curricula contribution to sustainability more holistically:
   Experiences from the integration of curricula assessment and students'
   perceptions at the Georgia Institute of Technology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{There has been a rapid increase on the number of engineering schools in
   higher educational institutions that have incorporated sustainability
   into their teaching. Nonetheless, curricula reforms are still needed to
   better educate engineers on the implications that their work has on the
   environment and societies in this generation and future ones. A step to
   facilitate this is assessing the contribution of engineering curricula
   to sustainability. This assessment can provide a starting point on how
   sustainability is being taught, and how this can be improved. This paper
   presents the results from the assessment of the sustainability content
   of the Civil and Environmental Engineering curriculum at the Georgia
   Institute of Technology using two complementary approaches: the
   Sustainability Tool for Assessing UNiversity's Curricula Holistically
   system and two students' perceptions surveys. The results from the
   curriculum assessment indicated that the courses addressed mainly
   environmental issues, and that the depth of coverage could be improved.
   The results from the students' surveys concurred with the curriculum
   assessment, although there were some differences in regard to social
   issues. Using both approaches provides a more holistic overview of the
   contribution of engineering courses and degrees to sustainability, and
   it allows detecting discrepancies between sustainability content in the
   syllabus and sustainability teaching in the classroom. The approaches
   can help to foster educational changes by: guiding university leaders in
   devising curricula reforms to promote sustainability learning; providing
   students with opportunities to reflect upon the topic; and bridging the
   gap between the activities being done at the university to foster
   sustainability and student perception of what needs to be achieved. (C)

Title = {{Rigorous calculations of permeation in mixed-matrix membranes:
   Evaluation of interfacial equilibrium effects and permeability-based
   models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{448}},
Pages = {{160-169}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We present rigorous calculations of single-component permeation in
   mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs), and show their importance in developing a
   more reliable understanding of MMM permeation behavior. We first develop
   methods for the construction of detailed and large-scale 3D mixed-matrix
   membrane (MMM) models, which are then solved by Unite-element methods.
   Our models explicitly account for the effects of matrix-filler
   interfacial equilibrium in addition to the differences in Fickian
   diffusivity between the two phases. Analytical equations (e.g., Maxwell
   model) can only predict the MMM permeability under an implicit
   assumption that the interfacial equilibrium constant K and the
   diffusivity ratio of the filler and the matrix (D-f/D-m) can be lumped
   into a single parameter, the permeability ratio P-f/P-m = KDf/D-m. It is
   shown here that the individual values of K and D-f/D-m, and not the
   combined permeability ratio P-f/P-m, determine the MMM permeability. Our
   simulations also indicate that an ideal MMM shows no significant direct
   effect of tiller particle size. We fit our computational data to an
   empirical correlation that can be easily and accurately used to
   calculate ideal MMM permeabilities, given equilibrium and diffusion data
   for the matrix and filler. We also examine some current issues regarding
   interpretation of MMM permeation behavior. For example, CO2 solubilities
   and diffusivities in representative MOF filler and polymer matrix
   materials are used to rigorously compare the `exact' predictions with
   permeability-based models. The rigorous calculations show non-monotonic
   behavior of the MMM permeability as a function of the matrix
   permeability, which cannot be predicted by permeability based models.
   Also, the `apparent' CO2 permeability of ZIF-8 fillers extracted with
   Maxwell and Lewis Nielsen models from the computational MMM permeation
   data, varies by 3 orders of magnitude depending upon the matrix polymer.
   Though the ZIF-8 filler maintains a constant permeability of similar to
   3000 Barrer, the permeability models would require postulation of
   (spurious) non-idealities such as matrix dependent filler behavior or
   interfacial rigidification to explain the results. Overall, this work
   provides a method for more reliable use of models to understand and
   design MMMs, as well as to better interpret the large and growing body
   of experimental data on these membranes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The need for annual revaccination against influenza is a burden on the
   healthcare system, leads to low vaccination rates and makes timely
   vaccination difficult against pandemic strains, such as during the 2009
   H1N1 influenza pandemic. In an effort toward achieving a broadly
   protective vaccine that provides cross-protection against multiple
   strains of influenza, this study developed a microneedle patch to
   co-immunize with A/PR8 influenza hemagglutinin DNA and A/PR8 inactivated
   virus vaccine. We hypothesize that this dual component vaccination
   strategy administered to the skin using microneedles will provide
   cross-protection against other strains of influenza. To test this
   hypothesis, we developed a novel coating formulation that did not
   require additional excipients to increase coating solution viscosity by
   using the DNA vaccine itself to increase viscosity and thereby enable
   thick coatings of DNA vaccine and inactivated virus vaccine on metal
   microneedles. Co-immunization in this way not only generated robust
   antibody responses against A/PR8 influenza but also generated robust
   heterologous antibody responses against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza in
   mice. Challenge studies showed complete cross-protection against lethal
   challenge with live pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus. Control experiments using
   A/PR8 inactivated influenza virus vaccine with placebo DNA coated onto
   microneedles produced lower antibody titers and provided incomplete
   protection against challenge. Overall, this is the first study showing
   DNA solution as a microneedle coating agent and demonstrating
   cross-protection by co-immunization with inactivated virus and DNA
   vaccine using coated microneedles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper reports on a structural concept for high stiffness and high
   damping performance. A stiff external frame and an internal resonating
   lattice are combined in a beamlike assembly which is characterized by
   high frequency bandgaps and tuned vibration attenuation at low
   frequencies. The resonating lattice consists of an elastomeric material
   arranged according to a chiral topology which is designed to resonate at
   selected frequencies. The concept achieves high damping performance by
   combining the frequency-selective properties of internally resonating
   structures, with the energy dissipation characteristics of their
   constituent material. The flexible ligaments, the circular nodes and the
   non-central interactions of the chiral topology lead to dynamic
   deformation patterns which are beneficial to energy dissipation.
   Furthermore, tuning and grading of the elements of the lattice allows
   for tailoring of the resonating properties so that vibration attenuation
   is obtained over desired frequency ranges. Numerical and experimental
   results demonstrate the tuning flexibility of this concept and suggest
   its potential application for load-carrying structural members parts of
   vibration and shock prone systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cell therapies offer exciting new opportunities for effectively treating
   many human diseases. However, delivery of therapeutic cells by
   intravenous injection, while convenient, relies on the relatively
   inefficient process of homing of cells to sites of injury. To address
   this limitation, a novel strategy has been developed to load cells with
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs), and to attract them
   to specific sites within the body by applying an external magnetic
   field. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated using human
   mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which may have a significant potential
   for regenerative cell therapies due to their ease of isolation from
   autologous tissues, and their ability to differentiate into various
   lineages and modulate their paracrine activity in response to the
   microenvironment. The efficient loading of hMSCs with polyethylene
   glycol-coated SPIOs is achieved, and it is found that SPIOs are
   localized primarily in secondary lysosomes of hMSCs and are not toxic to
   the cells. Further, the key stem cell characteristics, including the
   immunophenotype of hMSCs and their ability to differentiate, are not
   altered by SPIO loading. Through both experimentation and mathematical
   modeling, it is shown that, under applied magnetic field gradients,
   SPIO-containing cells can be localized both in vitro and in vivo. The
   results suggest that, by loading SPIOs into hMSCs and applying
   appropriate magnetic field gradients, it is possible to target hMSCs to
   particular vascular networks.}},

   Transmission Electron Microscopy reveals that struts are nanocrystalline

   dimensional analysis is approximately an order of magnitude greater than
   bulk copper and compares well with other nanostructured copper systems.

Abstract = {{We introduce a geometric framework to calculate the residual stress
   fields and deformations of nonlinear solids with inclusions and
   eigenstrains. Inclusions are regions in a body with different reference
   configurations from the body itself and can be described by distributed
   eigenstrains. Geometrically, the eigenstrains define a Riemannian
   3-manifold in which the body is stress-free by construction. The problem
   of residual stress calculation is then reduced to finding a mapping from
   the Riemannian material manifold to the ambient Euclidean space. Using
   this construction, we find the residual stress fields of three model
   systems with spherical and cylindrical symmetries in both incompressible
   and compressible isotropic elastic solids. In particular, we consider a
   finite spherical ball with a spherical inclusion with uniform pure
   dilatational eigenstrain and we show that the stress in the inclusion is
   uniform and hydrostatic. We also show how singularities in the stress
   distribution emerge as a consequence of a mismatch between radial and
   circumferential eigenstrains at the centre of a sphere or the axis of a
   cylinder.}},

Title = {{Defect formation by pristine indenter at the initial stage of
   nanoindentation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Nano-indentation is a sophisticated method to characterize mechanical
   properties of materials. This method samples a very small amount of
   material during each indentation. Therefore, this method is extremely
   useful to measure mechanical properties of nano-materials. The
   measurements using nanoindentation is very sensitive to the surface
   topology of the indenter and the indenting surfaces. The mechanisms
   involved in the entire process of nanoindentation require an atomic
   level understanding of the interplay between the indenter and the
   substrate. In this paper, we have used atomistic simulation methods with
   empirical potentials to investigate the effect of various types of
   pristine indenter on the defect nucleation and growth. Using molecular
   dynamics simulations, we have predicted the load-depth curve for
   conical, vickers, and sperical tip. The results are analyzed based on
   the coherency between the indenter tip and substrate surface for a fixed
   depth of 20 angstrom. The depth of defect nucleation and growth is
   observed to be dependent on the tip geometry. A tip with larger apex
   angle nucleates defects at a shallower depth. However, the type of
   defect generated is dependent on the crystalline orientation of the tip
   and substrate. For coherent systems, prismatic loops were generated,
   which released into the substrate along the close-packed directions with
   continued indentation. For incoherent systems, pyramidal shaped
   dislocation junctions formed in the FCC systems and disordered atomic
   clusters formed in the BCC systems. These defect nucleation and growth
   process provide the atomistic mechanisms responsible for the observed
   load-depth response during nanoindentation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Scandium fluoride displays isotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE)
   from at least 10 to 1100 K and retains a cubic ReO3-type structure over
   this range; the NTE is most pronounced at low temperatures. Control of
   thermal expansion was explored by forming Sc1-xYxF3 (x <= 0.25), which
   were characterized with synchrotron powder diffraction at ambient
   pressure from 100 to 800 K. The behavior of the solid solutions under
   pressure (<= 0.276 GPa) was also examined while heating from 298 to 523
   K. Insertion of the relatively large Y3+ ion into ScF3 results in a
   cubic-to-rhombohedral phase transition upon cooling from ambient
   temperature to 100 K, even at low substitution levels (5\%). The
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the solid solutions in the
   rhombohedral phase is strongly dependent on both composition and
   temperature; however, above 400 K, where all samples are cubic, the CTE
   appears to be largely independent of composition. The isothermal bulk
   modulus and CTE of ScF3, but not those of the solid solutions, are
   independent of temperature and pressure, respectively. Yttrium
   substitution lowers the bulk modulus, even at temperatures where the
   samples are cubic. Finally, the solid solutions stiffen upon heating.

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{To study sensory processing, stimuli are delivered to the sensory organs
   of animals and evoked neural activity is recorded downstream. However,
   noise and uncontrolled modulatory input can interfere with repeatable
   delivery of sensory stimuli to higher brain regions. Here we show how
   channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) can be used to deliver continuous,
   subthreshold, time-varying currents to neurons at any point along the
   sensory-motor pathway. To do this, we first deduce the frequency
   response function of ChR2 using a Markov model of channel kinetics. We
   then confirm ChR2's frequency response characteristics using
   continuously varying optical stimulation of neurons that express one of
   three ChR2 variants. We find that wild-type ChR2 and the E123T/H134R
   mutant ({''}ChETA{''}) can pass continuously-varying subthreshold
   stimuli with frequencies up to similar to 70 Hz. Additionally, we find
   that wild-type ChR2 exhibits a strong resonance at similar to 6-10 Hz.
   Together, these results indicate that ChR2-derived optogenetic tools are
   useful for delivering highly repeatable artificial stimuli that mimic in
   vivo synaptic bombardment.}},

Title = {{Behavioral and Electrophysiological Effects of Cortical Microstimulation
   Parameters}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Electrical microstimulation has been widely used to artificially
   activate neural circuits on fast time scales. Despite the ubiquity of
   its use, little is known about precisely how it activates neural
   pathways. Current is typically delivered to neural tissue in a manner
   that provides a locally balanced injection of positive and negative
   charge, resulting in negligible net charge delivery to avoid the
   neurotoxic effects of charge accumulation. Modeling studies have
   suggested that the most common approach, using a temporally symmetric
   current pulse waveform as the base unit of stimulation, results in
   preferential activation of axons, causing diffuse activation of neurons
   relative to the stimulation site. Altering waveform shape and using an
   asymmetric current pulse waveform theoretically reverses this bias and
   preferentially activates cell bodies, providing increased specificity.
   In separate studies, measurements of downstream cortical activation from
   sub-cortical microstimulation are consistent with this hypothesis, as
   are recent measurements of behavioral detection threshold currents from
   cortical microstimulation. Here, we compared the behavioral and
   electrophysiological effects of symmetric vs. asymmetric current
   waveform shape in cortical microstimulation. Using a go/no-go behavioral
   task, we found that microstimulation waveform shape significantly shifts
   psychometric performance, where a larger current pulse was necessary
   when applying an asymmetric waveform to elicit the same behavioral
   response, across a large range of behaviorally relevant current
   amplitudes. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging of cortex in
   anesthetized animals with simultaneous cortical microstimulation, we
   found that altering microstimulation waveform shape shifted the cortical
   activation in a manner that mirrored the behavioral results. Taken
   together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   asymmetric stimulation preferentially activates cell bodies, albeit at a
   higher threshold, as compared to symmetric stimulation. These findings
   demonstrate the sensitivity of the pathway to varying electrical
   stimulation parameters and underscore the importance of designing
   electrical stimuli for optimal activation of neural circuits.}},

Abstract = {{A special shear thinning phenomenon followed by static self-thickening
   in chitosan-graft-polyacrylamide (GPAM) aqueous solutions was
   investigated. This multiregion shear thinning can be defined as the
   first stage of the recently reported shear induced self-thickening (SIT)
   in our previous work. The three thinning regions (labeled as N1, N2, and
   N3) are considered very important, and they can reflex the complex
   variations of intermolecular interactions among and inside the
   aggregates in solution with increasing shear rate. To verify this
   multiregion shear thinning, a critical concentration of GPAM for this
   three-region shear thinning was first investigated. Shear recovery tests
   with the maximal shear rates located in the N1 N3 were carried out to
   ascertain the crucial role of shear thinning in SIT. The mechanisms of
   these three shear thinning regions were proposed based on the dependence
   of shear rheological behavior on various conditions in each region,
   including GPAM concentration, grafting ratio, temperature, added
   hydrogen bonding breaker, and salt. The above results confirm that N1 is
   due to the breakage of the interactions among hydrogen bonding
   aggregates, while N2 and N3 are attributed to the progressive
   destruction of the aggregates. As the first stage of SIT, shear thinning
   can markedly break the original aggregate and expose additional hydrogen
   bonding stickers to reform more aggregates with bigger size, resulting
   in the final higher viscosity.}},

Title = {{Bayesian-Based Ensemble Source Apportionment of PM2.5}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{13511-13518}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{A Bayesian source apportionment (SA) method is developed to provide
   source impact estimates and associated uncertainties. Bayesian-based
   ensemble averaging of multiple models provides new source profiles for
   use in a chemical mass balance (CMB) SA of fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5). The approach estimates source impacts and their uncertainties
   by using a short-term application of four individual SA methods: three
   receptor-based models and one chemical transport model. The method is
   used to estimate two seasonal distributions of source profiles that are
   used in SA for a long-term PM2.5 data set. For each day in a long-term
   PM2.5 data set, 10 source profiles are sampled from these distributions
   and used in a CMB application, resulting in 10 SA results for each day.
   This formulation results in a distribution of daily source impacts
   rather than a single value. The average and standard deviation of the
   distribution are used as the final estimate of source impact and a
   measure of uncertainty, respectively. The Bayesian-based source impacts
   for biomass burning correlate better with observed levoglucosan (R-2 =
   0.66) and water-soluble potassium (R-2 = 0.63) than source impacts
   estimated using more traditional methods and more closely agrees with
   observed total mass. The Bayesian approach also captures the expected
   seasonal variation of biomass burning and secondary impacts and results
   in fewer days with sources having zero impact. Sensitivity analysis
   found that using non-informative prior weighting performed better than
   using weighting based on method-derived uncertainties. This approach can
   be applied to long-term data sets from speciation network sites of the
   United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). In addition to
   providing results that are more consistent with independent observations
   and known emission sources being present, the distributions of source
   impacts can be used in epidemiologic analyses to estimate uncertainties
   associated with the SA results.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central
   symmetry in piezoelectric-semiconductors such as ZnO, GaN and InN,
   piezoelectric polarization charges are created at the interface region
   by applying a strain, which created a potential (piezopotential) in the
   crystal. Piezotronics is about the devices fabricated using the
   piezopotential as a ``gate{''} voltage to tune/control charge carrier
   transport at a contact or junction. The piezo-phototronic effect is to
   use the piezopotential to control the carrier generation, transport,
   separation and/or recombination for improving the performance of
   optoelectronic devices, such as solar cell and LED. Starting from the
   fundamental physics principles, this article gives an updated review
   about the fabrication of array of piezotronic devices so that they can
   be integrated into a system for achieving specific functions as sensors
   and MEMS. This first demonstration of fabricating array of piezotronic
   devices and integrated them into a system is a major milestone in
   nanotechnology, and it represents one of the promising directions of
   nanoelectronics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A measure of equity for public transit connectivity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{29-41}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An equitable transit system can cater to the needs of captive riders and
   maximize transit service coverage. Historically transit equity has not
   considered in planning or has been an afterthought in the process;
   leading to the underutilization of transit and encouraging travelers to
   be auto dependent. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology to
   estimate transit equity using a number of attributes such as frequency,
   speed, capacity, and built environment in a multi-modal transit network.
   We propose a methodology to measure transit equity from a graph
   theoretical approach for all levels of transit service coverage
   integrating routes, schedules, socio-economic, demographic and spatial
   activity patterns.
   The objective of using equity is to quantify and evaluate transit
   service in terms of prioritizing transit locations for funding;
   conforming with federal regulations; providing service delivery
   strategies, especially for areas with large multi-jurisdictional,
   multi-modal transit networks; providing an indicator of multi-level
   transit capacity for planning purposes and assessing the effectiveness
   and efficiency for node/stop prioritization while choosing transit as a
   mode of travel. The methodology uses a stylized connectivity measure
   with a Gini index for equity estimation at different levels such as
   stop, line, zone and area. An example problem is presented to
   demonstrate the proposed methodology. The approach is then applied to
   the Washington-Baltimore region in the United States. The results show
   the existing transit service coverage at different locations. The
   proposed approach can be utilized as a tool for transit service
   planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid emergence of Chip Multi-Processors (CMP) as the de facto
   microprocessor archetype has highlighted the importance of scalable and
   efficient on-chip networks. Packet-based Networks-on-Chip (NoC) are
   gradually cementing themselves as the medium of choice for the
   multi-/many-core systems of the near future, due to their innate
   scalability. However, the prominence of the debilitating power wall
   requires the NoC to also be as energy efficient as possible. To achieve
   these two antipodal requirements-scalability and energy efficiency-we
   propose TornadoNoC, an interconnect architecture that employs a novel
   flow control mechanism. To prevent livelocks and deadlocks, a sequence
   numbering scheme and a dynamic ring inflation technique are proposed,
   and their correctness formally proven. The primary objective of
   TornadoNoC is to achieve substantial gains in (a) scalability to
   many-core systems and (b) the area/power footprint, as compared to
   current state-of-the-art router implementations. The new router is
   demonstrated to provide better scalability to hundreds of cores than an
   ideal single-cycle wormhole implementation and other
   scalability-enhanced low-cost routers. Extensive simulations using both
   synthetic traffic patterns and real applications running in a
   full-system simulator corroborate the efficacy of the proposed design.
   Finally, hardware synthesis analysis using commercial 65nm standard-cell
   libraries indicates that the area and power budgets of the new router
   are reduced by up to 53\% and 58\%, respectively, as compared to
   existing state-of-the-art low-cost routers.}},

Abstract = {{The Fontan procedure, although an imperfect solution for children born
   with a single functional ventricle, is the only reconstruction at
   present short of transplantation. The haemodynamics associated with the
   total cavopulmonary connection, the modern approach to Fontan, are

   contribute to the long-term complications that are frequently noted.
   Through recent technological advances, spear-headed by advances in
   medical imaging, it is now possible to virtually model these surgical
   procedures and evaluate the patient-specific haemodynamics as part of
   the pre-operative planning process. This is a novel paradigm with the
   potential to revolutionise the approach to Fontan surgery, help to
   optimise the haemodynamic results, and improve patient outcomes. This
   review provides a brief overview of these methods, presents preliminary
   results of their clinical usage, and offers insights into its potential

   pulsating electron beam bombardment. The pulsed volumetric heating from
   the e-beam attenuation heats up the foil (similar to 2.54 x 10(-5) m
   thick) rapidly and often causes the foil to fail, increasing the
   operation cost and down time for the laser. Various methods have been
   investigated forheat transfer enhancement. While elevated heat transfer
   was achieved, the previous methods assume a flat foil shape. The actual
   foil shape is scalloped due to the pressure difference across the foil
   during the laser operation. Also a new ``scalloped{''} foil design was
   proposed for thermal stress reduction. This paper investigates the
   applicability of small locally impinging jets to cooling the
   scalloped-shaped foil. The jets were formed through a line of small
   circular openings on two stainless-steel jet tubes aligned with the foil
   edges having the two columns of jets impinging on the foil obliquely in
   a staggered pattern for improved coverage. CFD simulations were used to
   optimize jet configurations. Experiments were performed that utilize a
   scalloped foil strip which matched the foil shape between two
   neighboring supporting ribs in the Electra hibachi. Jet diameters and
   jet velocities were varied at a surface heat flux greater than 20.0
   kW/m(2). Substantial heat transfer enhancement with impinging jets was
   observed. Average Nusselt numbers were correlated with jet Reynolds
   number and the normalized jet-to-foil distance. The study indicates that
   the impinging jets can effectively enhance heat transfer for the
   scalloped foil and can be a promising method for actual foil cooling of
   KrF lasers, including Electra. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop an improved and generalized technique for correcting
   T1-related signal fluctuations (T1 effect) in cardiac-gated functional
   magnetie resonance imaging (fMRI) data with flip angle estimation.
   Theory and MethodsSpatial maps of flip angle and T1 are jointly
   estimated from cardiac-gated time series using a Kalman filter. These
   maps are subsequently used for removing the T1 effect in the presence of
   B1 inhomogeneity. The new technique was compared with a prior technique
   that uses T1 only while assuming a homogeneous flip angle of 90 degrees.
   The robustness of the new technique is demonstrated with simulated and
   experimental data.
   ResultsSimulation results revealed that the new method led to increased
   temporal signal-to-noise ratio across a large range of flip angles, T1s,
   and stimulus onset asynchrony means compared to the T1 only approach.
   With the experimental data, the new approach resulted in higher average
   gray matter temporal signal-to-noise ratio of seven subjects (84 vs.
   48). The new approach also led to a higher statistical score of
   activation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (P < 0.002).
   ConclusionThe new technique is able to remove the T1 effect robustly and
   is a promising tool for improving the ability to map activation in fMRI,
   especially in subcortical regions. Magn Reson Med 70:1626-1633, 2013.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate effects of different
   concentrations of tetracycline (TC) on the microbial community and
   development of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) of sequencing batch
   reactors (SBRs). Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA and real-time
   fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used
   to detect the structural changes of the microbial community and the
   variations of eight TC resistance genes tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(E),
   tet(M), tet(O), tet(S) and tet(X), respectively. The results indicated
   that, trace TC could substantially change the structure of the microbial
   community. Bacteria which could not adapt to environment with TC were
   gradually replaced by those adapting to tetracycline. Shannon's
   diversity index (H) and Simpson's index (D) reached maximum values when
   the concentration of TC was 1 mu g L-1. The resistance genes in the
   activated sludge proliferated under the pressure of trace TC. (C) 2013

   However, a low degree of CIP biotransformation was observed in a
   fed-batch denitrifying culture after a lag time even though the
   microbial, denitrifying activity was gradually inhibited at 24-40 mg

Abstract = {{Bacterial populations housed in microfluidic environments can serve as
   transceivers for molecular communication, but the data-rates are
   extremely low (e. g., 10(-5) bits per second.). In this work,
   genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacteria were maintained in a
   microfluidic device where their response to a chemical stimulus was
   examined over time. The bacteria serve as a communication receiver where
   a simple modulation such as on-off keying (OOK) is achievable, although
   it suffers from very poor data-rates. We explore an alternative
   communication strategy called time-elapse communication (TEC) that uses
   the time period between signals to encode information. We identify the
   limitations of TEC under practical non-zero error conditions and propose
   an advanced communication strategy called smart time-elapse
   communication (TEC-SMART) that achieves over a 10x improvement in
   data-rate over OOK. We derive the capacity of TEC and provide a
   theoretical maximum data-rate that can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Children requiring artificial heart-lung support through
   extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are at increased risk of
   developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Continuous renal replacement
   therapy (CRRT) is the preferred method of treatment in pediatric AKI
   patients. CRRT devices are noted to provide inaccurate fluid balance
   (FB) when operated under low flow rates seen in children. We present the
   design and validation of a novel pump concept to provide accurate
   pediatric CRRT during ECMO.
   Methods: A diaphragm pump was prototyped with a working stroke volume
   (SV) of 7 mL. Fluid transport occurs by periodic expansion and
   contraction of a flexible membrane due to pressure fluctuations of
   hydraulic fluid contained below its surface. Comparison of intravenous
   (IV) pumps to the diaphragm pump was conducted in vitro across the range
   of pressures observed during CRRT in ECMO. The pump was integrated into
   a CRRT circuit parallel with ECMO and FB accuracy was evaluated.
   Results: The pump design improved efficiency of fluid transport, with
   flow rate errors as low as 1-5 ml/hr as compared to IV pumps (15-50
   ml/hr). The SV of IV pumps increased with source pressure in a nearly
   linear manner compared to the minimal variation produced by the
   diaphragm pump. Inclusion of the diaphragm pump in a conventional CRRT
   circuit with ECMO improved the FB accuracy.
   Conclusions: A novel diaphragm pump concept has been presented for
   providing CRRT during ECMO in the pediatric population. Improvement of
   the pump accuracy compared to currently used CRRT pumps was demonstrated
   via in vitro testing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative study of the global responses of heat
   release and chemiluminescence emissions of a laminar premixed flame
   excited by oscillations in fuel/air ratio. Chemiluminescence
   fluctuations are a commonly used marker of heat release oscillations in
   unsteady flames. While there is strong evidence of a good correlation
   between these two quantities in situations where the flame is excited by
   velocity oscillations, the situation is less well understood for cases
   where the excitation is due to fuel/air ratio oscillations. This is due
   to the fact that chemiluminescence is not only a function of the heat
   release rate, but also a strong function of the fuel/air ratio itself.
   This work attempts to assess this issue by theoretically evaluating
   linear transfer functions for the global chemiluminescence and heat
   release responses of the flame. It is shown that they are qualitatively
   similar in all cases, but that there are quantitative differences
   between the two that depend upon operating conditions, nominal flame
   geometry, and which radical species is being measured.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the hybrid stochastic deterministic coarse mesh radiation
   transport method COMET is extended to 2D cylindrical geometry for
   whole-core neutronics calculations. To facilitate the extension new
   functions in cylindrical geometry were developed for expanding the

   is tested in a set of simplified pebble bed reactor cores in 20 (r,
   Theta) geometry, consisting of an inner reflector, an annular fuel
   region, a controlled outer reflector. The comparisons indicate that
   COMET achieves an accuracy close to the Monte Carlo method (MCNP), with
   computational efficiency for core calculations that is at least 3 orders
   of magnitude faster than that of MCNP when a precomputed response
   library with a 4th order expansion in space and a 2nd order expansion in
   the polar and azimuthal angles is used. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The solid skeleton of an aquifer moves in response to changes in water
   pressure, barometric pressure, Earth tides and other factors, and
   measuring these movements can help characterize aquifers. A device for
   measuring the vertical displacement and horizontal shear, or tilt, at
   the same time and place has been developed by combining a tiltmeter and
   extensometer on a frame that can be temporarily anchored to borehole
   walls. The device can resolve displacements on the order of 10(-8) m and
   tilts on the order of 10(-8) rad. During a 4 h long pumping test in
   fractured gneiss, the rock contracted by 3 mu m in response to 2 m of
   drawdown, a compliance of roughly 1.5 mu m of displacement/meter of head
   change (1.5 x 10(-10) m/Pa). Tilt of 10 s of mu rad to the southwest
   occurred during pumping and both the displacement and the tilt returned
   during recovery. The tilt signal is repeatable during sequential tests
   and it changes in magnitude with depth. It can be explained by a
   fracture zone that strikes roughly EW and dips to the south. Semidiurnal
   tilts of roughly 0.1 mu rad occur during ambient conditions at periods
   of the O1 and M2 Earth tides. Diurnal displacements of several tens of
   nanometers are associated with ambient fluctuations in water level when
   barometric pressure changed by several 100 Pa. Increasing barometric
   pressure causes water level to fall, but elevates the total pressure in
   the well. This correlates with dilational displacement, while falling
   total pressure correlates with contraction during ambient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In semiarid complex terrain, the combination of elevation and aspect
   promotes variations in the water and energy balance, resulting in slopes
   with distinct ecologic and hydrologic properties. Quantifying the
   differential energy and water dynamics of opposing slopes can provide
   essential information on the potential effects of climate variability on
   landscapes. In this study, we use observations from a network of
   hydrologic sensors deployed on the slopes of a semiarid catchment in
   central New Mexico, USA, to quantify the ecohydrologic dynamics of two
   coexisting and contrasting ecosystems: a juniper (Juniperus monosperma)
   savanna on a north facing slope (NFS) and a creosote (Larrea tridentata)
   shrubland on a south facing slope (SFS). Our analyses show that: (1)
   energy loads exert a first-order control on the dynamics of
   evapotranspiration and soil moisture residence times in the catchment,
   with vegetation imposing a second-order control at the onset of the
   growing season; (2) soils exhibit a characteristic progression of
   moisture and temperature along the slope-aspect continuum that is
   preserved throughout the year, going from a wetter and cooler NFS to a
   drier and warmer SFS; (3) there are remarkable differences in the runoff
   dynamics among the catchment slopes, with a smaller precipitation
   threshold triggering larger SFS runoff amounts than at its NFS
   counterpart; and (4) seasonal water balances of the NFS and SFS follow
   opposite trajectories in the year and point to distinct soil water pools
   for evapotranspiration demands. The results of this study have important
   implications for understanding landscape changes in areas of complex
   topography under current and future climate variability.}},

Abstract = {{Nanonetworks, i.e., networks of nano-sized devices, are the enabling
   technology of long-awaited applications in the biological, industrial
   and military fields. For the time being, the size and power constraints
   of nano-devices limit the applicability of classical wireless
   communication in nanonetworks. Alternatively, nanomaterials can be used
   to enable electromagnetic (EM) communication among nano-devices. In this
   paper, a novel graphene-based nano-antenna, which exploits the behavior
   of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in semi-finite size Graphene
   Nanoribbons (GNRs), is proposed, modeled and analyzed. First, the
   conductivity of GNRs is analytically and numerically studied by starting
   from the Kubo formalism to capture the impact of the electron lateral
   confinement in GNRs. Second, the propagation of SPP waves in GNRs is
   analytically and numerically investigated, and the SPP wave vector and
   propagation length are computed. Finally, the nano-antenna is modeled as
   a resonant plasmonic cavity, and its frequency response is determined.
   The results show that, by exploiting the high mode compression factor of
   SPP waves in GNRs, graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas are able to
   operate at much lower frequencies than their metallic counterparts, e.
   g., the Terahertz Band for a one-micrometer-long ten-nanometers-wide
   antenna. This result has the potential to enable EM communication in
   nanonetworks.}},

Abstract = {{Catalysts incorporating acid and base cooperative interactions can more
   efficiently catalyze the aldol and nitroaldol reactions than single

   both reaction partners. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis
   studies demonstrate that limiting acid-base interactions is important
   and can be achieved by using weak acids (including surface silanols of
   heterogeneous catalysts) or using a rigid backbone between the acid and
   base. For heterogeneous catalysts, cooperativity between amines and
   silanols can be tuned by controlling the alkyl linker length of the
   aminosilane and controlling the silica support pore size. The nitroaldol
   condensation is more sensitive to these parameters than the aldol
   condensation, resulting in an order of magnitude difference in reaction
   rates when varying these two parameters. While knowledge of the
   amine-silanol cooperativity is still limited, these findings demonstrate
   useful structure-property trends that can be used to design more
   efficient bio-inspired catalysts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   tested against long-term retreat rate estimates. In this work the
   headcut retreat resulting from plunge pool erosion in the Channel
   Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD) model is calibrated
   and compared to long-term evolution measurements of six gullies at the
   Bardenas Reales, northeast Spain. The headcut retreat module of CHILD
   was calibrated by adjusting the shape factor parameter to fit the
   observed retreat and volumetric soil loss of one gully during a 36year
   period, using reported and collected field data to parameterize the rest
   of the model. To test the calibrated model, estimates by CHILD were
   compared to observations of headcut retreat from five other neighboring
   gullies. The differences in volumetric soil loss rates between the
   simulations and observations were less than 0.05m(3)yr(-1), on average,
   with standard deviations smaller than 0.35m(3)yr(-1). These results are
   the first evaluation of the headcut retreat module implemented in CHILD
   with a field data set. These results also show the usefulness of the
   model as a tool for simulating long-term volumetric gully evolution due
   to plunge pool erosion.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the problem of estimating parameters for Generalized Extreme
   Value (GEV) models when one or more alternatives are censored in the
   sample data, i.e., all decision makers who choose these censored
   alternatives are excluded from the sample; however, information about
   the censored alternatives is still available. This problem is common in
   marketing and revenue management applications, and is essentially an
   extreme form of choice-based sampling. We review estimators typically
   used with GEV models, describe why many of these estimators cannot be
   used for these censored samples, and present two approaches that can be
   used to estimate parameters associated with censored alternatives. We
   detail necessary conditions for the identification of parameters
   associated exclusively with the utility of censored alternatives. These
   conditions are derived for single-level nested logit, multi-level nested
   logit and cross-nested logit models. One of the more surprising results
   shows that alternative specific constants for multiple censored
   alternatives that belong to the same nest can still be separately
   identified in nested logit models. Empirical examples based on simulated
   datasets demonstrate the large-sample consistency of estimators and
   provide insights into data requirements needed to estimate these models
   for finite samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nanofluids, suspensions of nanoparticles (less than 100 nm) in a
   basefluid, have shown enhanced heat transfer characteristics. In this
   study, thermal performances of nanofluids in industrial type heat
   exchangers are investigated. Three mass particle concentrations of 2\%,
   4\%, and 6\% of silicon dioxide-water (SiO2-water) nanofluids are
   formulated by dispersing 20 nm diameter nanoparticles in distilled
   water. Experiments are conducted to compare the overall heat transfer
   coefficient and pressure drop of water vs. nanofluids in
   laboratory-scale plate and shell-and-tube heat exchangers. Experimental
   results show both augmentation and deterioration of heat transfer
   coefficient for nanofluids depending on the flow rate and nanofluid
   concentration through the heat exchangers. This trend could be explained
   by the counter effect of the changes in thermo-physical properties of
   fluids together with the fouling on the contact surfaces in the heat
   exchangers. The measured pressure drop while using nanofluids show an
   increase when compared to that of basefluid which could limit the use of
   nanofluids in industrial applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting and storage are the two most important energy
   technologies developed for portable, sustainable, and self-sufficient
   power sources for mobile electronic systems. However, both have
   limitations for providing stable direct-current (DC) with an infinite
   lifetime. Herein, we integrated a triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG)-based mechanical energy harvester with Li-ion-battery (LIB)-based
   energy storage as a single device for demonstrating a flexible
   self-charging power unit (SCPU), which allows a battery to be charged
   directly by ambient mechanical motion. This physical integration enables
   a new operation mode of the SCPU: the ``sustainable mode{''}, in which
   the LIB stores the TENG-generated electricity while it is driving an
   external load. With the LIB being replenished by the ambient mechanical
   energy, the SCPU can keep providing a constant voltage to the load by
   utilizing the stable difference between the battery's intrinsic
   electrode potentials. This study will impact the traditional trends of
   battery research and advance the development of the self-powered
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a unique technology for
   harvesting ambient mechanical energy based on the triboelectric effect,
   has been proven to be a cost-effective, simple, and robust approach for
   self-powered systems. However, a general challenge is that the output
   current is usually low. Here, we demonstrated a rationally designed TENG
   with integrated rhombic gridding, which greatly improved the total
   current output owing to the structurally multiplied unit cells connected
   in parallel. With the hybridization of both the contact-separation mode
   and sliding electrification mode among nanowire arrays and nanopores
   fabricated onto the surfaces of two contact plates, the newly designed
   TENG produces an open-circuit voltage up to 428 V, and a short-circuit
   current of 1.395 mA with the peak power density of 30.7 W/m(2). Relying
   on the TENG, a self-powered backpack was developed with a
   vibration-to-electric energy conversion efficiency up to 10.62(+/- 1.19)
   \%. And it was also demonstrated as a direct power source for
   instantaneously lighting 40 commercial light-emitting diodes by
   harvesting the vibration energy from natural human walking. The newly
   designed TENG can be a mobile power source for field engineers,
   explorers, and disaster-relief workers.}},

Abstract = {{Gaseous and particulate species from two prescribed fires were sampled
   in-situ, to better characterize prescribed burn emissions. Measurements
   included gaseous and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) species, particle
   number concentration, particulate organic carbon (POC) speciation,
   water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and water-soluble iron. Major PM2.5
   components included OC (similar to 57\%), EC (similar to 10\%), chloride
   (similar to 1.6\%), potassium (similar to 0.7\%) and nitrate (similar to
   0.9\%). Major gaseous species include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
   methane, ethane, methanol and ethylene. Particulate organic tracers of
   biomass burning, such as levoglucosan, dehydroabietic acid and retene,
   increased significantly during the burns. Water-soluble organic carbon
   (WSOC) also increased significantly during the fire and levels are
   highly correlated with total potassium (K) (R-2 = 0.93) and levoglucosan
   (R-2 = 0.98). The average WSOC/OC ratio was 0.51 +/- 0.03 and did not
   change significantly from background levels. Thus, the WSOC/OC ratio may
   not be a good indicator of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in regions
   that are expected to be impacted by biomass burning. Results using a
   biomass burning source profile derived from this work further indicate
   that source apportionment is sensitive to levels of potassium in biomass
   burning source profiles. This underscores the importance of quantifying
   local biomass burning source profiles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Hydrodynamic parameters for ErPr cryocooler regenerator fillers under
   steady and periodic flow conditions}},
Journal = {{CRYOGENICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{68-77}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The regenerator, typically a microporous structure that is subject to
   periodic flow of a cryogenic fluid, is the most critical component of
   Pulse Tube or Stirling cryocoolers, which are widely used for
   high-demand defense and aerospace applications. Despite the critical
   impact of hydrodynamic irreversibilities in the regenerator on the
   overall cycle efficiency, the impact of the parameters that influence
   these losses are poorly understood. In this investigation, experiments
   were conducted in which steady and oscillatory flows of helium were
   imposed on Er50Pr50 rare-earth regenerator filler material and mass flow
   and pressure drop data were recorded under ambient temperature
   conditions. A filler material composed of 63-75 mu m diameter Er50Pr50
   spheres was selected based on current commercially available particle
   geometries. The flow parameters in the experiments were in the laminar
   flow range. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD)-assisted method was
   applied for the analysis and interpretation of the experimental data,
   with sinusoidal time variations of inlet and exit boundary conditions
   for the periodic flow case. The permeability and inertial coefficients
   that led to agreement between the experimental data and computational
   simulations were iteratively obtained. The resulting Darcy permeability
   and Forchheimer inertial coefficients are reported herein. A constant
   Darcy permeability value for all steady and periodic flow tests was
   found to correlate well to experimental data. The Forchheimer inertial
   coefficients were correlated and found to be functions of the system
   charge pressure and the pore-based Reynolds number. The results also
   show that the periodic flow inertial coefficients are different than the
   steady flow parameters typically used. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to develop a new cost-effective CO2
   sorbent, K2CO3/TiO(OH)(2) or KTi, with inexpensive and widely available
   K2CO3 and nanoporous TiO(OH), as supporting material. The performance of
   KTi CO2 capture was evaluated using a fixed-bed tubular reactor under
   different experimental conditions, including sorption temperature, flow
   rate, and moisture concentration of flue gas. Use of TiO(OH), as a
   support for K2CO3 leads to a significant increase of CO2 sorption
   capacity per unit of K2CO3 by about 37 times. The optimal K2CO3 loading
   on TiO(OH), is 30 wt \%. The highest sorption capacity achieved with KTi
   is 1.69 mmol of CO2/g of KTi, whereas the theoretical sorption capacity
   of KTi with the prepared TiO(OH), could be as high as 3.32 mmol of CO2/g
   of KTi. The enthalpy change of the KTi-based CO2 sorption is -28.51
   kcal/mol. Moreover, KTi is regenerable and stable. Therefore, KTi is a
   promising CO2 sorbent.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate cardiovascular biology and disease, but the
   role of flow-sensitive microRNAs in atherosclerosis is still unclear.
   Here we identify miRNA-712 (miR-712) as a mechanosensitive miRNA
   upregulated by disturbed flow (d-flow) in endothelial cells, in vitro
   and in vivo. We also show that miR-712 is derived from an unexpected
   source, pre-ribosomal RNA, in an exoribonuclease-dependent but DiGeorge
   syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8)-independent manner, suggesting that
   it is an atypical miRNA. Mechanistically, d-flow-induced miR-712
   downregulates tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3)
   expression, which in turn activates the downstream matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs)
   and stimulate pro-atherogenic responses, endothelial inflammation and
   permeability. Furthermore, silencing miR-712 by anti-miR-712 rescues
   TIMP3 expression and prevents atherosclerosis in murine models of
   atherosclerosis. Finally, we report that human miR-205 shares the same
   `seed sequence' as murine-specific miR-712 and also targets TIMP3 in a
   flow-dependent manner. Targeting these mechanosensitive `athero-miRs'
   may provide a new treatment paradigm in atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{The single-event effect sensitivity of fourth-generation, 90 nm SiGe
   HBTs is investigated. Inverse-mode, >= 1.0 Gbps SiGe digital logic using
   standard, unoptimized, fourth-generation SiGe HBTs is demonstrated and
   the inverse-mode shift register exhibited a reduction in bit-error cross
   section across all ion-strike LETs. Ion-strike simulations on dc
   calibrated, 3-D TCAD SiGe HBT models show a reduction in peak current
   transient magnitude and a reduction in overall transient duration for
   bulk SiGe HBTs operating in inverse mode. These improvements in
   device-level SETs are attributed to the electrical isolation of the
   physical emitter from the subcollector-substrate junction and the high

Abstract = {{The effects of X-ray and proton radiation on a LiNbO2 analog memristor
   are investigated by I-V hysteresis, Electrochemical Impedance
   Spectroscopy, low-frequency AC voltage, and X-ray diffraction analysis.
   Both electrical and structural characterization of an irradiated
   memristor show that irradiation leads to an increased level of defects
   in the LiNbO2 crystalline lattice. These radiation-induced defects
   facilitate faster lithium movement as shown by electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy measurements on the as-grown and irradiated memristor.
   X-ray radiation improves ionic motion in the bulk of the device and
   increases the ionic resistance at the LiNbO2-metal interface. In the
   case of proton radiation, the memristance response improves due to an
   increase in ionic motion in the bulk and at the interfaces. It is also
   shown by Monte Carlo simulations that proton irradiation of LiNbO2
   results in structural damage, which was verified experimentally by an
   X-ray diffraction study.}},

Abstract = {{The design of biologically-inspired wireless communication systems using
   bacteria as the basic element of the system is initially motivated by a
   phenomenon called Quorum Sensing. Due to high randomness in the
   individual behavior of a bacterium, reliable communication between two
   bacteria is almost impossible. Therefore, we have recently proposed that
   a population of bacteria in a cluster is considered as a bio node in the
   network capable of molecular transmission and reception. This
   proposition enables us to form a reliable bio node out of many
   unreliable bacteria. In this paper, we study the communication between
   two nodes in such a network where information is encoded in the
   concentration of molecules by the transmitter. The molecules produced by
   the bacteria in the transmitter node propagate through the diffusion
   channel. Then, the concentration of molecules is sensed by the bacteria
   population in the receiver node which would decode the information and
   output light or fluorescent as a result. The uncertainty in the
   communication is caused by all three components of communication, i.e.,
   transmission, propagation and reception. We study the theoretical limits
   of the information transfer rate in the presence of such uncertainties.
   Finally, we consider Mary signaling schemes and study their achievable
   rates and corresponding error probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In LTE systems with heterogeneous user mobilities, low-mobility users
   favor frequency selective scheduling while high-mobility users benefit
   from frequency diversity scheduling. To benefit both low-and
   high-mobility users simultaneously, scheduling exploiting frequency
   selectivity and diversity is desired. To enable the scheduling,
   low-complexity user mobility classification to distinguish these two
   types of users is required. In this paper, we first propose a user
   mobility classification algorithm, which is robust to different channel
   delay profiles (CDPs), for single-transmit-antenna systems. Then, we
   extend it to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A
   low-complexity scheduling algorithm, exploiting both
   frequency-selectivity and diversity for low-and high-mobility users
   simultaneously, is also developed. As demonstrated by the simulation
   results, the proposed user classification algorithm is robust to
   different CDPs and the proposed scheduling algorithm is effective.}},

   A modified expectation-maximization algorithm is introduced to
   efficiently estimate parameters in the model. Simulations show that the

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the biomathematical community has devoted
   substantial effort to the complicated challenge of estimating parameter
   values for biological systems models. An even more difficult issue is
   the characterization of functional forms for the processes that govern
   these systems. Most parameter estimation approaches tacitly assume that
   these forms are known or can be assumed with some validity. However,
   this assumption is not always true. The recently proposed method of
   Dynamic Flux Estimation (DFE) addresses this problem in a genuinely
   novel fashion for metabolic pathway systems. Specifically, DFE allows
   the characterization of fluxes within such systems through an analysis
   of metabolic time series data. Its main drawback is the fact that DFE
   can only directly be applied if the pathway system contains as many
   metabolites as unknown fluxes. This situation is unfortunately rare. To
   overcome this roadblock, earlier work in this field had proposed
   strategies for augmenting the set of unknown fluxes with independent
   kinetic information, which however is not always available. Employing
   Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse methods of linear algebra, the present
   article discusses an approach for characterizing fluxes from metabolic
   time series data that is applicable even if the pathway system is
   underdetermined and contains more fluxes than metabolites. Intriguingly,
   this approach is independent of a specific modeling framework and
   unaffected by noise in the experimental time series data. The results
   reveal whether any fluxes may be characterized and, if so, which subset
   is characterizable. They also help with the identification of fluxes
   that, if they could be determined independently, would allow the
   application of DFE. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The current investigation assesses the effect of voids in the thermal
   interface material (TIM) on the thermal performance of silicon chip
   packages. The effects of the voids were included in the TIM using a
   series of analytical and numerical models that employed an effective
   volume-averaged thermal conductivity for the TIM and the actual voids
   within the TIM. Different void concentrations and distributions were
   evaluated using this numerical simulation process. The junction-to-air
   thermal resistance of the package was calculated in order to effectively
   evaluate the thermal performance of the chip package. A series of
   parametric studies were conducted and indicated that a 3-D numerical
   model using actual holes up to a number of 100 and at different
   concentrations in volume predicts similar results as a 3-D model using a
   volume-average effective thermal conductivity of the TIM. Finally, it
   was found that the analytical model developed here provides results that
   compare favorably with those obtained using more complex and time
   intensive 3-D models (approximately 7-10\%). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a method to engineer, in vitro, a nascent
   microvasculature within a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold with a
   view to overcoming the major issue of graft failure due to avascular
   necrosis of tissue-engineered constructs. Human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured alone and in various co-culture
   combinations with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to determine their
   vasculogenic abilities in vitro. Results demonstrated that the delayed
   addition of MSCs to preformed EC networks, whereby MSCs act as pericytes
   to the nascent vessels, resulted in the best developed vasculature. The
   results also demonstrate that the crosstalk between ECs and MSCs during
   microvessel formation occurs in a highly regulated, spatio-temporal
   fashion, whereby the initial seeding of ECs results in platelet derived
   growth factor (PDGF) release; the subsequent addition of MSCs 3 days
   later leads to a cessation in PDGF production, coinciding with increased
   vascular endothelial cell growth factor expression and enhanced vessel
   formation. Functional assessment of these pre-engineered constructs in a
   subcutaneous rat implant model demonstrated anastomosis between the in
   vitro engineered vessels and the host vasculature, with significantly
   increased vascularization occurring in the co-culture group. This study
   has thus provided new information on the process of in vitro
   vasculogenesis within a three-dimensional porous scaffold for tissue
   engineering and demonstrates the potential for using these vascularized
   scaffolds in the repair of critical sized bone defects. (C) 2013 Acta

Pages = {{9522-9528}},

Abstract = {{The mineral phase of dentin is located primarily within collagen
   fibrils. During development, bone or dentin collagen fibrils are formed
   first and then water within the fibril is replaced with apatite
   crystallites. Mineralized collagen contains very little water. During
   dentin bonding, acid-etching of mineralized dentin solubilizes the
   mineral crystallites and replaces them with water. During the
   infiltration phase of dentin bonding, adhesive comonomers are supposed
   to replace all of the collagen water with adhesive monomers that are
   then polymerized into copolymers. The authors of a recently published
   review suggested that dental monomers were too large to enter and
   displace water from collagen fibrils. If that were true, the endogenous
   proteases bound to dentin collagen could be responsible for unimpeded
   collagen degradation that is responsible for the poor durability of
   resin-dentin bonds. The current work studied the size-exclusion
   characteristics of dentin collagen, using a gel-filtration-like column
   chromatography technique, using dentin powder instead of Sephadex. The
   elution volumes of test molecules, including adhesive monomers, revealed
   that adhesive monomers smaller than similar to 1000 Da can freely
   diffuse into collagen water, while molecules of 10,000 Da begin to be
   excluded, and bovine serum albumin (66,000 Da) was fully excluded. These
   results validate the concept that dental monomers can permeate between
   collagen molecules during infiltration by etch-and-rinse adhesives in
   water-saturated matrices. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{We provide insights into new methodology for the analysis of multilevel
   binary data observed longitudinally, when the repeated longitudinal
   measurements are correlated. The proposed model is logistic functional
   regression conditioned on three latent processes describing the within-
   and between-variability, and describing the cross-dependence of the
   repeated longitudinal measurements. We estimate the model components
   without employing mixed-effects modeling but assuming an approximation
   to the logistic link function. The primary objectives of this article
   are to highlight the challenges in the estimation of the model
   components, to compare two approximations to the logistic regression
   function, linear and exponential, and to discuss their advantages and
   limitations. The linear approximation is computationally efficient
   whereas the exponential approximation applies for rare events functional
   data. Our methods are inspired by and applied to a scientific experiment
   on spectral backscatter from long range infrared light detection and
   ranging (LIDAR) data. The models are general and relevant to many new
   binary functional data sets, with or without dependence between repeated
   functional measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A novel low-cost molding process to prepare polymer-based micro-lens

   by combining a hot-forming process and a chemical-foaming process; 2)
   the silicon mold, used as the lower part of the molds, was fabricated by
   etching; 3) an anti-stick layer was coated on the concave surface of the
   glass mold; and 4) the lens material, UV-curable glue, was dispensed
   into the concave molds, followed by curing and de-molding. The optical
   properties of the lens were characterized by a profile meter and a beam

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a control framework for stabilization and
   command following of nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems. The proposed
   methodology consists of a new command governor architecture and an
   adaptive controller. The command governor is a dynamical system that
   adjusts the trajectory of a given command to follow an ideal reference
   system capturing a desired closed-loop dynamical system behavior in
   transient time. Specifically, we show that the controlled nonlinear
   uncertain dynamical system can approach the ideal reference system by
   choosing the design parameter of the command governor. In addition, an
   adaptive element is used to asymptotically assure that the error between
   the controlled nonlinear uncertain dynamical system and the ideal
   reference system is reduced in long term. Therefore, the proposed
   methodology not only has closed-loop transient and steady-state
   performance guarantees but can also shape the transient response by
   adjusting the trajectory of the given command with the command governor.
   We highlight that there exists a trade-off between the adaptive
   controller's learning rate and the command governor's design parameter.
   This key feature of our framework allows rapid suppression of system
   uncertainties without resorting to a high learning rate in the adaptive
   controller. Furthermore, we discuss the robustness properties of the
   proposed approach with respect to high-frequency dynamical system
   content such as measurement noise and/or unmodeled dynamics. A numerical
   example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   architecture. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness
   in the western world in those over age 60. While this disorder is
   complex, the origin of injury appears to be at the level of the retinal
   pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruchs membrane, and inner choroid. A
   potential method to replace damaged tissue in AMD is to harvest healthy
   donor tissue (RPE-Bruchs-Choroid) from an eye and translocate it to the
   injured subretinal region. Such an autograft avoids immune mediated
   rejection and can theoretically restore function to the neurosensory
   retina (light sensitive part of the retina) by restoring the damaged
   tissue. Such a procedure requires the design of a device that
   mechanically supports the integrity of the graft while inside the eye,
   without injuring or disrupting the tissue. This paper presents the
   systematic design and manufacture of a thin shape memory foil-based
   tissue translocation device. The selected embodiment of the design uses
   thermal adhesion of the tissue to the foil surfaces for tissue support.
   The shape memory effect enables insertion of the device into the eye via
   a small incision. The device is manufactured using micromachining
   techniques and has been tested both ex vivo and in vivo with acceptable
   anatomic results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a facile synthesis of Rh tetrahedrons with concave
   side faces by collectively manipulating the reaction kinetics,
   facet-selective capping, and surface diffusion of atoms. Specifically, a
   combination of Na3RhCl6, triethylene glycol, L-ascorbic acid, and citric
   acid provides the right conditions for generating the concave
   tetrahedrons. After the formation of small Rh tetrahedral seeds through
   self-nucleation, the subsequently generated Rh atoms were selectively
   deposited onto the corner sites to generate Rh tetrapods. At the same
   time, the deposited atoms could diffuse from the corners to edges to
   generate concave side faces because the diffusion to face sites was
   restrained by the citric acid adsorbed on the \{111\} facets. This study
   offers deep insight into the growth mechanism involved the formation of
   noble-metal nanocrystals with concave surfaces. The Rh concave
   tetrahedrons were encased by a mix of \{111\} and \{110\} facets,
   showing great potential for catalytic applications.}},

   open-circuit voltage up to 101 V and a short-circuit current of 55.7 mu
   A with a peak power density of 252.3 mW/m(2). The TENG was
   systematically investigated and demonstrated as a direct power source

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3) regulates
   osteoblasts through genomic and rapid membrane-mediated responses. Here
   we examined the interaction of protein disulfide isomerase family A.
   member 3 (Pdia3) and the traditional vitamin D receptor (VDR) in plasma
   membrane-associated responses to l alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. We found that
   Pdia3 co-localized with VDR and the caveolae scaffolding protein,
   caveolin-1 on the surface of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Immunoprecipitation
   showed that both Pdia3 and VDR interacted with caveolin-1. Pdia3 further
   interacted with phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA), whereas VDR
   interacted with c-Src. l alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 changed the interactions and
   transport of the two receptors and rapidly activated phospholipase A2
   (PLA2) and c-Src. Silencing either receptor or caveolin-1 inhibited both
   PLA2 and c-Src, indicating that the two receptors function
   interdependently. These two receptor dependent rapid responses to 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 regulated gene expression, proliferation and
   apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells. These data demonstrate the importance of
   both receptors and caveolin-1 in mediating membrane responses to 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 and subsequently regulating osteoblast biology. (C)

Abstract = {{Regioselective ring opening of 1,2-epoxyhexane with methanol can be
   catalyzed by Co-III-salen complexes, whereas related Co-II complexes are
   inactive species in this and other epoxide ring-opening reactions. In
   this work, Co-salen complexes supported on a highly cross-linked polymer
   resin are synthesized, characterized, and utilized as catalysts for the
   ring-opening of 1,2-epoxyhexane with methanol. By manipulating the
   metalation degree of a polymeric resin containing salen ligands, Co
   salen catalysts are immobilized on various batches of the same polymeric
   support with different Co densities. The supported catalysts are shown
   to have different turnover frequencies on a Co-III basis in the
   reaction, with the rates correlating with the overall cobalt content
   rather than the Co-III content alone. The observation that both Co-III
   and Co-II salen species play a role in the reaction has not yet been
   observed to occur in other epoxide ring-opening systems studied to date,
   and the results here demonstrate the reaction to kinetically be
   approximately 0.1 order in Co-II species. Catalyst recycling studies
   imply that both cobalt and counter-anion leaching account for the
   catalyst deactivation.}},

Title = {{Stability of Amorphous Silica-Alumina in Hot Liquid Water}},
Journal = {{CHEMSUSCHEM}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2304-2315}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Herein, the hydrothermal stability of amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) is
   investigated under conditions relevant for the catalytic conversion of
   biomass, namely in liquid water at 200 degrees C. The hydrothermal
   stability of ASA is much higher than that of pure silica or alumina.
   Interestingly, the synthetic procedure used plays a major role in its
   resultant stability: ASA prepared by cogelation (CG) lost its
   microporous structure, owing to hydrolysis of the siloxane bonds, but
   the resulting mesoporous material still had a considerable surface area.
   ASA prepared by deposition precipitation (DP) contained a silicon-rich
   core and an aluminum-rich shell. In hot liquid water, the latter
   structure was transformed into a layer of amorphous boehmite, which
   protected the particle from further hydrolysis. The surface area showed
   relatively minor changes during the transformation. Independent of the
   synthetic method used, the ASAs retained a considerable concentration of
   acid sites. The concentration of acid sites qualitatively followed the
   changes in surface area, but the changes were less pronounced. The
   performance of different ASAs for the hydrolysis of cellobiose into
   glucose is compared.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray polarimetry, sometimes alone, and sometimes coupled to spectral
   and temporal variability measurements and to imaging, allows a wealth of
   physical phenomena in astrophysics to be studied. X-ray polarimetry
   investigates the acceleration process, for example, including those
   typical of magnetic reconnection in solar flares, but also emission in
   the strong magnetic fields of neutron stars and white dwarfs. It detects
   scattering in asymmetric structures such as accretion disks and columns,
   and in the so-called molecular torus and ionization cones. In addition,
   it allows fundamental physics in regimes of gravity and of magnetic
   field intensity not accessible to experiments on the Earth to be probed.
   Finally, models that describe fundamental interactions (e.g. quantum
   gravity and the extension of the Standard Model) can be tested. We
   describe in this paper the X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE),
   proposed in June 2012 to the first ESA call for a small mission with a
   launch in 2017. The proposal was, unfortunately, not selected. To be
   compliant with this schedule, we designed the payload mostly with
   existing items. The XIPE proposal takes advantage of the completed phase
   A of POLARIX for an ASI small mission program that was cancelled, but is
   different in many aspects: the detectors, the presence of a solar flare
   polarimeter and photometer and the use of a light platform derived by a
   mass production for a cluster of satellites. XIPE is composed of two out
   of the three existing JET-X telescopes with two Gas Pixel Detectors
   (GPD) filled with a He-DME mixture at their focus. Two additional GPDs
   filled with a 3-bar Ar-DME mixture always face the Sun to detect
   polarization from solar flares. The Minimum Detectable Polarization of a
   1 mCrab source reaches 14 \% in the 2-10 keV band in 10(5) s for pointed
   observations, and 0.6 \% for an X10 class solar flare in the 15-35 keV
   energy band. The imaging capability is 24 arcsec Half Energy Width (HEW)
   in a Field of View of 14.7 arcmin x 14.7 arcmin. The spectral resolution
   is 20 \% at 6 keV and the time resolution is 8 mu s. The imaging
   capabilities of the JET-X optics and of the GPD have been demonstrated
   by a recent calibration campaign at PANTER X-ray test facility of the
   Max-Planck-Institut fur extraterrestrische Physik (MPE, Germany). XIPE
   takes advantage of a low-earth equatorial orbit with Malindi as
   down-link station and of a Mission Operation Center (MOC) at INPE
   (Brazil). The data policy is organized with a Core Program that
   comprises three months of Science Verification Phase and 25 \% of net
   observing time in the following 2 years. A competitive Guest Observer
   program covers the remaining 75 \% of the net observing time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   for a discrete-time inverse optimal control scheme of a doubly fed
   induction generator (DFIG). For the inverse optimal scheme, a control
   Lyapunov function (CLF) is proposed to obtain an inverse optimal control
   law in order to achieve trajectory tracking. A posteriori, it is
   established that this control law minimizes a meaningful cost function.
   The CLFs depend on matrix selection in order to achieve the control
   objectives; this matrix is determined by two mechanisms: initially,
   fixed parameters are proposed for this matrix by a trial-and-error
   method and then by using the PSO algorithm. The inverse optimal control
   scheme is illustrated via simulations for the DFIG, including the
   comparison between both mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of network formation in a distributed fashion.
   Network formation is modeled as a strategic-form game, where agents
   represent nodes that form and sever unidirectional links with other
   nodes and derive utilities from these links. Furthermore, agents can
   form links only with a limited set of neighbors. Agents trade off the
   benefit from links, which is determined by a distance-dependent reward
   function, and the cost of maintaining links. When each agent acts
   independently, trying to maximize its own utility function, we can
   characterize ``stable{''} networks through the notion of Nash
   equilibrium. In fact, the introduced reward and cost functions lead to
   Nash equilibria (networks), which exhibit several desirable properties
   such as connectivity, bounded-hop diameter, and efficiency (i.e.,
   minimum number of links). Since Nash networks may not necessarily be
   efficient, we also explore the possibility of ``shaping{''} the set of
   Nash networks through the introduction of state-based utility functions.
   Such utility functions may represent dynamic phenomena such as
   establishment costs (either positive or negative). Finally, we show how
   Nash networks can be the outcome of a distributed learning process. In
   particular, we extend previous learning processes to so-called
   ``state-based{''} weakly acyclic games, and we show that the proposed
   network formation games belong to this class of games.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1830s, Michael Faraday performed his seminal experimental
   research on electromagnetic induction, in which he created the first
   electric dynamo-a machine for continuously converting rotational
   mechanical energy into electrical energy. His machine was a conducting
   disc, rotating between the poles of a permanent magnet, with the
   voltage/current obtained from brushes contacting the disc. In his first
   dynamo, the magnetic field was asymmetric with respect to the axis of
   the disc. This is to be contrasted with some of his later symmetric
   designs, which are the ones almost invariably discussed in textbooks on
   electromagnetism. In this paper, a theoretical analysis is developed for
   Faraday's first dynamo. From this analysis, the eddy currents in the
   disc and the open-circuit voltage for arbitrary positioning of the
   brushes are determined. The approximate analysis is verified by
   comparing theoretical results with measurements made on an experimental
   recreation of the dynamo. Quantitative results from the analysis are
   used to elucidate Faraday's qualitative observations, from which he
   learned so much about electromagnetic induction. For the asymmetric
   design, the eddy currents in the disc dissipate energy that makes the
   dynamo inefficient, prohibiting its use as a practical generator of
   electric power. Faraday's experiments with his first dynamo provided
   valuable insight into electromagnetic induction, and this insight was
   quickly used by others to design practical generators. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{2-O-D-Glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G), a stable L-ascorbic acid
   derivative, is usually synthesized by cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase
   (CGTase), which contains nine substrate-binding subsites (from +2 to
   -7). In this study, iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) was performed
   on the -6 subsite residues (Y167, G179, G180, and N193) in the CGTase
   from Paenibacillus macerans to improve its specificity for maltodextrin,
   which is a cheap and easily soluble glycosyl donor for AA-2G synthesis.
   Site saturation mutagenesis of four sites-Y167, G179, G180, and N193-was
   first performed and revealed that four mutants-Y167S, G179R, N193R, and
   G180R-produced AA-2G yields higher than those of other mutant and
   wild-type CGTases. ISM was then conducted with the best positive mutant
   as a template. Under optimal conditions, mutant Y167S/G179K/N193R/G180R
   produced the highest AA-2G titer of 2.12 g/liter, which was 84\% higher
   than that (1.15 g/liter) produced by the wild-type CGTase. Kinetics
   analysis of AA-2G synthesis using mutant CGTases confirmed the enhanced
   maltodextrin specificity and showed that compared to the wild-type
   CGTase, the mutants had no cyclization activity but high hydrolysis and
   disproportionation activities. A possible mechanism for the enhanced
   substrate specificity was also analyzed through structure modeling of
   the mutant and wild-type CGTases. These results indicated that the -6
   subsite played crucial roles in the substrate binding and catalytic
   reactions of CGTase and that the obtained CGTase mutants, especially
   Y167S/G179K/N193R/G180R, are promising starting points for further
   development through protein engineering.}},

   Various commercially-existing automated identification (ID) and

   of personnel. When such gates are positioned at the entrance or within
   construction sites and once low-cost passive RFID tags are embedded or
   attached to PPE, automatic site access, time recording, and completeness
   control can be performed. These improve the logistics of the existing
   compliance checking process and provide users with timely feedback.
   Results to ``personnel entering a construction site{''} demonstrate how

Abstract = {{Limited visibility due to blind spots of construction equipment was

   the number of different visibility analyses that can be performed. A new
   approach to compute blind spot in a fast and efficient way using point
   cloud data of equipment is presented. The developed approach allows
   performing different analyses such as: volumetric blind spots, blind
   spot map, 12 m circumference visibility, rectangular 1 m boundary
   visibility, and worker visibility. In addition, the above set of
   analyses can be performed from different viewpoints located virtually

Abstract = {{Endogenous signals originating at the site of injury are involved in the
   paracrine recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of circulating
   progenitor and diverse inflammatory cell types. Here, we investigate a
   strategy to exploit endogenous cell recruitment mechanisms to regenerate
   injured bone by local targeting and activation of sphingosine-1
   -phosphate (SIP) receptors. A mandibular defect model was selected for
   evaluating regeneration of bone following trauma or congenital disease.
   The particular challenges of mandibular reconstruction are inherent in
   the complex anatomy and function of the bone given that the area is
   highly vascularized and in close proximity to muscle. Nanofibers
   composed of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLAGA) and polycaprolactone
   (PCL) were used to delivery FTY720, a targeted agonist of SIP receptors
   1 and 3. In vitro culture of bone progenitor cells on drug-loaded
   constructs significantly enhanced SDF1 alpha mediated chemotaxis of bone
   marrow mononuclear cells. In vivo results show that local delivery of
   FTY720 from composite nanofibers enhanced blood vessel ingrowth and
   increased recruitment of M2 alternatively activated macrophages, leading
   to significant osseous tissue ingrowth into critical sized defects after
   12 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate that local activation
   of S1P receptors is a regenerative cue resulting in recruitment of wound
   healing or anti-inflammatory macrophages and bone healing. Use of such
   small molecule therapy can provide an alternative to biological factors
   for the clinical treatment of critical size craniofacial defects. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, skin effect is incorporated into the unconditionally
   stable Laguerre finite-difference time-domain method for transient
   simulation of multiscale structures. The skin effect is modeled by
   imposing the surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) to the surface
   of the conductor, which significantly reduces the computational effort.
   Two methods of applying SIBC are proposed and discussed in detail. A
   procedure for transferring the time-domain convolution into Laguerre
   domain in recursive form is also discussed. In addition, a method for
   embedding and de-embedding port resistors for fast simulation and
   accurate extraction of frequency-domain response is proposed. The
   results have been validated using measurements, along with the stability
   analysis of the two implementation methods. Simulation results from the
   multiscale structures are presented and are compared with measurements
   which show good accuracy and improved computational efficiency.}},

   platform combining radio frequency identification (RFID), microfluidics,
   and inkjet printing technology that enables remote fluid analysis and

   microfluidic capacitors, resonators, and RFID tags are fabricated using
   a novel rapid, low-cost, and low-temperature additive inkjet process,
   making them disposable. However, even with their disposable nature, the
   RF microfluidic devices exhibit repeatability and long-term reusability
   for accurately detecting water, various alcohols, and \% content of
   water/alcohol mixtures down to 1\% water in ethanol. While the main
   discussion is on fluid sensing, the demonstrated components can also be
   used in fluid-tunable RF applications.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral and directional control of thermal radiation is a challenging
   yet important task for a number of applications, including
   thermophotovoltaic energy conversion, solar energy utilization, space
   thermal management, and high-efficiency incandescent lamps. A number of
   structures have been proposed as coherent emission sources, with
   spectral emission peaks in well-defined directions. The grating
   structure has been commonly used in which coherent emission is achieved
   by the excitation of surface polaritons or surface waves. Along with the
   development of metamaterials, magnetic polaritons have also received
   much attention lately and have been demonstrated to be useful for
   controlling the radiative properties of periodic structures.
   Furthermore, planar structures can also support surface waves or optical
   resonance for thermal emission control, such as the truncated
   one-dimensional photonic crystals and asymmetric Fabry-Perot structures.
   This article provides an overview of theoretical and experimental
   research activities, performed in the Nanoscale Thermal Radiation Lab at
   the Georgia Institute of Technology, on tailoring the spectral and

Title = {{System identification of the nonlinear dynamics in the thalamocortical
   circuit in response to patterned thalamic microstimulation in vivo}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Nonlinear system identification approaches were used to
   develop a dynamical model of the network level response to patterns of
   microstimulation in vivo. Approach. The thalamocortical circuit of the
   rodent vibrissa pathway was the model system, with voltage sensitive dye
   imaging capturing the cortical response to patterns of stimulation
   delivered from a single electrode in the ventral posteromedial thalamus.
   The results of simple paired stimulus experiments formed the basis for
   the development of a phenomenological model explicitly containing
   nonlinear elements observed experimentally. The phenomenological model
   was fit using datasets obtained with impulse train inputs,
   Poisson-distributed in time and uniformly varying in amplitude. Main
   results. The phenomenological model explained 58\% of the variance in
   the cortical response to out of sample patterns of thalamic
   microstimulation. Furthermore, while fit on trial-averaged data, the
   phenomenological model reproduced single trial response properties when
   simulated with noise added into the system during stimulus presentation.
   The simulations indicate that the single trial response properties were
   dependent on the relative sensitivity of the static nonlinearities in
   the two stages of the model, and ultimately suggest that electrical
   stimulation activates local circuitry through linear recruitment, but
   that this activity propagates in a highly nonlinear fashion to
   downstream targets. Significance. The development of nonlinear dynamical
   models of neural circuitry will guide information delivery for sensory
   prosthesis applications, and more generally reveal properties of
   population coding within neural circuits.}},

   equivalent pin model}},
Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{338-353}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adaptable to nonstructural environment, compliant joints are competent
   candidates for flexure fingers in humanoid robotic hands. This paper
   presents an equivalent pin model (EPM), which provides an in-depth
   understanding on flexure finger dynamics by accounting for the moving
   rotation center and varying radius of a compliant joint. Distinguished
   from other lumped-parameter formulations based on constant-axis
   pin-joint approximation, the large deformation of a compliant joint is
   characterized by closed-form solutions obtained from a distributed
   Euler-Bernoulli (E-B) beam model. Modeling tolerance guidelines derived
   by comparing the E-B model against finite element analysis (FEA) without
   neglecting shear distortions are provided for designing dimensions of a
   compliant joint. Design evaluation is illustrated with a flexure finger
   consisting of three phalanxes by comparing the maximum stress among
   different configurations. The EPM reveals critical effects of rotational
   center-offset and varying radius on the dynamic response of a flexure
   finger, showing that the negligence of these effects yields an
   out-of-phase prediction in joint rotation. Although presented in the
   scope of finger manipulation, the method is expected to have potential
   applications for multi-body dynamics involving compliant mechanisms. (C)

Abstract = {{Fretting of AISI 301 stainless steel sheet in contact with AISI 52100
   steel from 20 degrees C to 550 degrees C in air and argon has been

   behavior of this pair have been identified as a function of temperature.
   Strength and ductility of 301SS is reduced from 20 degrees C to 250
   degrees C, increasing susceptibility to fretting damage. Steady state
   friction decreases as temperature increases, reducing cyclic stresses.
   Wear resistance increases in this temperature range, increasing fatigue
   damage due to the increase in fatigue life associated with increased
   wear. This study aims to identify the causes of the transitions in
   behavior and determine the net outcome of the competing effects with

Abstract = {{We have developed omniBiomarker, a web-based application that uses
   knowledge from the NCI Cancer Gene Index to guide the selection of
   biologically relevant algorithms for identifying biomarkers. Biomarker
   identification from high-throughput genomic expression data is difficult
   because of data properties (i.e., small-sample size compared to
   large-feature size) as well as the large number of available feature
   selection algorithms. Thus, it is unclear which algorithm should be used
   for a particular dataset. These factors lead to instability in biomarker
   identification and affect the reproducibility of results. We introduce a
   method for computing the biological relevance of feature selection
   algorithms using an externally validated knowledge base of manually
   curated cancer biomarkers. Results suggest that knowledge-driven
   biomarker identification can improve microarray-based clinical
   prediction performance. omniBiomarker can be accessed at

Abstract = {{The goal of a drug delivery system (DDS) is to convey a drug where the
   medication is needed, while, at the same time, preventing the drug from
   affecting other healthy parts of the body. Drugs composed of micro-or
   nano-sized particles (particulate DDS) that are able to cross barriers
   which prevent large particles from escaping the bloodstream are used in
   the most advanced solutions. Molecular communication (MC) is used as an
   abstraction of the propagation of drug particles in the body. MC is a
   new paradigm in communication research where the exchange of information
   is achieved through the propagation of molecules. Here, the transmitter
   is the drug injection, the receiver is the drug delivery, and the
   channel is realized by the transport of drug particles, thus enabling
   the analysis and design of a particulate DDS using communication tools.
   This is achieved by modeling the MC channel as two separate
   contributions, namely, the cardiovascular network model and the drug
   propagation network. The cardiovascular network model allows to
   analytically compute the blood velocity profile in every location of the
   cardiovascular system given the flow input by the heart. The drug
   propagation network model allows the analytical expression of the drug
   delivery rate at the targeted site given the drug injection rate.
   Numerical results are also presented to assess the flexibility and
   accuracy of the developed model. The study of novel optimization
   techniques for a more effective and less invasive drug delivery will be
   aided by this model, while paving the way for novel communication
   techniques for Intrabody communication networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the performances of conventional Cu/low-k

   14-, 10-, and 7-nm technology nodes corresponding to the even years

   interconnect variables, such as size effect parameters, barrier/liner
   bilayer thickness, and aspect ratio on the design and performance of the
   MIN of a logic core. The number of metal levels for a high-performance
   chip increases by as large as 34\% due to size effects, and this value
   can go up to 76\% considering issues in barrier/liner thickness scaling
   at the 7-nm technology node. At this node, increasing the aspect ratio
   of interconnects from two to three can improve wire delay and save two
   metal levels at the cost of 35\% more power dissipation. A +/- 20\%
   wire-width variation induces wire delay variations of -20\% and 44\% at
   minimum-width wires. Designing the MIN considering this variation
   increases the required wire area by 4\% in the worst case.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We analyze physical-layer security based on the premise that the coding
   mechanism for secrecy over noisy channels is tied to the notion of
   channel resolvability. Instead of considering capacity-based
   constructions, which associate to each message a subcode that operates
   just below the capacity of the eavesdropper's channel, we consider
   channel-resolvability-based constructions, which associate to each
   message a subcode that operates just above the resolvability of the
   eavesdropper's channel. Building upon the work of Csiszar and Hayashi,
   we provide further evidence that channel resolvability is a powerful and
   versatile coding mechanism for secrecy by developing results that hold
   for strong secrecy metrics and arbitrary channels. Specifically, we show
   that at least for symmetric wiretap channels, random capacity-based
   constructions fail to achieve the strong secrecy capacity, while
   channel-resolvability-based constructions achieve it. We then leverage
   channel resolvability to establish the secrecy-capacity region of
   arbitrary broadcast channels with confidential messages and a cost
   constraint for strong secrecy metrics. Finally, we specialize our
   results to study the secrecy capacity of wireless channels with perfect
   channel state information (CSI), mixed channels, and compound channels
   with receiver CSI, as well as the secret-key capacity of source models
   for secret-key agreement. By tying secrecy to channel resolvability, we
   obtain achievable rates for strong secrecy metrics with simple proofs.}},

   nanostructure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{637-645}},

Abstract = {{Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices can convert thermal radiation directly
   into electricity. To improve the efficiency of TPV systems,
   wavelength-selective emitters are designed to take thermal energy from
   various heat sources and then emit photons to the TPV cells. A
   two-dimensional grating/thin-film nanostructure is proposed as an
   efficient emitter, whose performance is enhanced by the excitations of
   both surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and magnetic polaritons (MPs).
   Rigorous coupled-wave analysis is used to predict the emittance as well
   as the electromagnetic field and current density distributions. The
   normal emittance of the proposed nanostructure is shown to be
   wavelength-selective and polarization-insensitive. The mechanisms of SPP
   and MP excitations in the nanostructure are elucidated for different
   polarizations. The current-density loop further confirms the existence
   of magnetic resonances. Furthermore, the effect of azimuthal and polar
   angles on the emittance spectra is also investigated, suggesting that
   the proposed structure has high emittance not only in the normal
   direction but also at large oblique angles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The lymphatic system plays crucial roles in tissue fluid balance,
   trafficking of immune cells, and the uptake of dietary lipid from the
   intestine. Given these roles there has been an interest in targeting
   lymphatics through oral lipid-based formulations or intradermal delivery
   of drug carrier systems. However the mechanisms regulating lipid uptake
   by lymphatics remain unknown. Thus we sought to modify a previously
   developed in vitro model to investigate the role of ATP in lipid uptake
   into the lymphatics.
   Lymphatic endothelial cells were cultured on a transwell membrane and
   the effective permeability to free fatty acid and Caco-2 cell-secreted
   lipid was calculated in the presence or absence of the ATP inhibitor
   sodium azide.
   ATP inhibition reduced Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid transport, but not
   dextran transport. FFA transport was ATP-dependent primarily during
   early periods of ATP inhibition, while Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid
   transport was lowered at all time points studied. Furthermore, the
   transcellular component of transport was highly ATP-dependent, a
   mechanism not observed in fibroblasts, suggesting these mechanisms are
   unique to lymphatics. Total transport of Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid was
   dose-dependently reduced by ATP inhibition, and transcellular
   lipoprotein transport was completely attenuated.
   The transport of lipid across the lymphatic endothelium as demonstrated
   with this in vitro model occurs in part by an ATP-dependent,
   transcellular route independent of passive permeability. It remains to
   be determined the extent that this mechanism exists in vivo and future
   work should be directed in this area.}},

Abstract = {{An inductive antenna mismatch recovery method is presented. The proposed
   method uses series LC matching network to maintain a power amplifier
   (PA) performance under an inductive antenna mismatch condition. This
   method requires only the voltage amplitude information, which reduces
   the complexity in implementation. This paper also presents design
   considerations of integrated recovery system in a complementary
   metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. Simulation results show that
   the proposed CMOS PA maintains its output power as well as efficiency
   very close to the well-matched 50 Omega condition with inductively
   mismatched antenna impedance up to +j.70 which is corresponding to the
   voltage standing wave ratio of 2.5.}},

Abstract = {{Solar Radiation Management (SRM) has two characteristics that make it
   useful for managing climate risk: it is quick and it is cheap. SRM
   cannot, however, perfectly offset CO2-driven climate change, and its use
   introduces novel climate and environmental risks. We introduce SRM in a
   simple economic model of climate change that is designed to explore the
   interaction between uncertainty in the climate's response to CO2 and the
   risks of SRM in the face of carbon-cycle inertia. The fact that SRM can
   be implemented quickly, reducing the effects of inertia, makes it a
   valuable tool to manage climate risks even if it is relatively
   ineffective at compensating for CO2-driven climate change or if its
   costs are large compared to traditional abatement strategies.
   Uncertainty about SRM is high, and decision makers must decide whether
   or not to commit to research that might reduce this uncertainty. We find
   that even modest reductions in uncertainty about the side-effects of SRM
   can reduce the overall costs of climate change in the order of 10\%.}},

   the resource efficient delivery of on-demand content to end users in a
   timely manner. Within the proposed framework, a cooperative transmission
   strategy suggests that users who have access to the requested content
   cooperatively transmit to the targeted set of users. In doing so, we can
   minimize the servicing requirements at the server side and improve the
   scalability performance in the network. We conducted extensive
   simulations and showed that significant performance improvements can be
   achieved with the proposed delivery techniques to enable efficient
   access to an ever growing on-demand content. We also showed the

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The creation of low hysteresis superhydrophobic paper is reported using
   a combination of oxygen plasma etching and plasma deposition of an 80 nm
   non-fluorinated, hydrophilic diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The DLC
   has an equilibrium (flat surface) contact angle (theta (e) ) of 68.2A
   degrees A A +/- A 1.5A degrees, which is well below the 90A degrees
   contact angle that is typically believed to be a prerequisite for
   superhydrophobicity. Coating of paper substrates with the DLC film
   yields an advancing contact angle of 124.3A degrees A A +/- A 4.1A
   degrees, but the surface remains highly adhesive, with a receding
   contact angle < 10A degrees. After 60 min of plasma etching and DLC
   coating, a low hysteresis, superhydrophobic surface is formed with an
   advancing contact angle of 162.0A degrees A A +/- A 6.3A degrees and
   hysteresis of 8.7A degrees A A +/- A 1.9A degrees. To understand the
   increase in contact angle and decrease in hysteresis, atomic force
   microscopy and optical profilometry studies were performed. The data
   demonstrates that while little additional nanoscale roughness is
   imparted beyond the first 5 min of etching, the roughness at the
   microscale continually increases. The hierarchical structure provides
   the appropriate roughness to create low hysteresis superhydrophobic
   paper from a hydrophilic coating.}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are
   clinically useful because of their immunomodulatory and regenerative
   properties, but MSC therapies are limited by the loss of self-renewal
   and cell plasticity associated with ex vivo expansion culture and, on
   transplantation, increased immunogenicity from xenogen exposure during
   culture. Recently, pooled human platelet lysate (hPL) has been used as a
   culture supplement to promote MSC growth; however, the effects of hPL on
   MSCs after fetal bovine serum (FBS) exposure remain unknown. Methods.
   MSCs were cultured in medium containing FBS or hPL for up to 16
   passages, and cell size, doubling time and immunophenotype were
   determined. MSC senescence was assessed by means of a fluorometric assay
   for endogenous beta-galactosidase expression. MSCs cultured with FBS for
   different numbers of passages were switched to hPL conditions to
   evaluate the ability of hPL to ``rescue{''} the proliferative capacity
   of MSCs. Results. hPL culture resulted in more rapid cell proliferation
   at earlier passages (passage 5 or earlier) than remove PBS; by day 4,
   hPL (5\%) yielded an MSC doubling time of 1.28 days compared with 1.52
   days in 16\% FBS. MSCs cultured first in FBS and switched to hPL
   proliferated more and demonstrated less beta-galactosidase production
   and smaller cell sizes than remove MSCs continuously propagated in FBS.
   Conclusions. hPL enables rapid expansion of MSCs without adversely
   affecting immunophenotype. hPL culture of aged and senescent MSCs
   demonstrated cellular rejuvenation, reflected by decreased doubling time
   and smaller cell size. These results suggest that expansion of MSCs in
   hPL after FBS exposure can enhance cell phenotype and proliferative
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{To recover a sparse signal from an underdetermined system, we often
   solve a constrained l(1)-norm minimization problem. In many cases, the
   signal sparsity and recovery performance can be further improved by
   replacing the l(1) norm with a ``weighted{''} l(1) norm. Without prior
   information about the signal's nonzero elements, the procedure for
   selecting weights is iterative in nature. Common approaches update the
   weights at every iteration using the solution of a weighted l(1) problem
   from the previous iteration. This paper presents two homotopy-based
   algorithms that efficiently solve reweighted l(1) problems. First, we
   present an algorithm that quickly updates the solution of a weighted
   l(1) problem as the weights change. Since the solution changes only
   slightly with small changes in weights, we develop a homotopy algorithm
   that replaces old weights with new ones in a small number of
   computationally inexpensive steps. Second, we propose an algorithm that
   solves a weighted l(1) problem by adaptively selecting weights while
   estimating the signal. This algorithm integrates the reweighting into
   every step along the homotopy path by changing the weights according to
   changes in the solution and its support, allowing us to achieve a high
   quality signal reconstruction by solving a single homotopy problem. We
   compare both algorithms' performance, in terms of reconstruction
   accuracy and computational complexity, against state-of-the-art solvers
   and show that our methods have smaller computational cost. We also show
   that the adaptive selection of the weights inside the homotopy often
   yields reconstructions of higher quality.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturers produce complex parts by utilizing computer-aided

   on parallel algorithms and hardware that utilizes voxel models. The use
   of new parallel algorithms allows rapid calculations of tool paths
   automatically from the voxel model. The core components of this
   framework are a method of generating digital voxel models from
   tessellated surface models, a method to obtain digital surface
   information by a parallel ray-casting approach, and a new approach to
   calculate gouge-free tool paths in parallel from surface information and
   generalized cutting geometry. The performance of utilizing digital
   models within this framework is then discussed with respect to timing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A stepped-bar apparatus has been designed and constructed to
   characterize the thermal resistance of materials using steady-state heat
   transfer techniques. The design of the apparatus is a modification of
   the ASTM D5470 standard where reference bars of equal cross-sectional
   area are used to extrapolate surface temperatures and heat flux across a
   sample of unknown thermal resistance. The design modification involves
   intentionally oversizing the upper reference bar (URB) of the apparatus
   to avoid contact area uncertainty due to reference bar misalignment,
   which is difficult to account for, as well as the high cost that can be
   associated with equipping the apparatus with precise alignment controls
   (e.g., pneumatic alignment). Multidimensional heat transfer in the upper
   reference bar near the sample interface is anticipated using numerical
   modeling. The resulting nonlinear temperature profile in the upper
   reference bar is accounted for by fitting a second order regression line
   through thermocouple readings near the sample interface. The thermal
   resistances of commercially available thermal gap pads and thermal
   pastes were measured with the stepped-bar apparatus; the measured values
   were in good agreement with published results, and exhibited a high
   degree of reproducibility. The measurement uncertainty of both the
   standard and stepped-bar apparatus decrease with increased thermocouple
   precision. Notably, the uncertainty due to reference bar misalignment
   with the standard apparatus becomes more pronounced as thermocouple
   precision and the number of thermocouples increases, which suggests that
   the stepped-bar apparatus would be especially advantageous for enabling
   accurate, high-precision measurements of very low thermal resistances.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral dissolution is a common chemomechanical digenetic process in
   geological systems. The penetration resistance in sediments that have
   experienced dissolution is studied using a laboratory-scale cone
   penetration test device and a calibration chamber. Variables include the
   initial sediment density and mass fraction of soluble grains. Results
   show that the void ratio increases with the extent of mineral
   dissolution; the magnitude of the void ratio change is higher in
   initially dense sediments. A terminal void ratio is found for
   dissolution; the void ratio after dissolution will not exceed this
   terminal void ratio regardless of the extent of dissolution. For
   boundary conditions applied in this study, the terminal void ratio for
   dissolution corresponds to a relative density of Dr approximate to 15\%
   , which is attained when dissolution exceeds a mass fraction loss of
   10\%. While the tip resistance decreases after dissolution, the drop in
   tip resistance is most pronounced in initially dense sands. A single
   penetration resistance versus density trend is observed for all tests,
   regardless of the changes in lateral stress and fabric that soils may
   have experienced as a result of mineral dissolution.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of heat and mass transfer in a
   falling-film absorber with microchannel tube arrays was conducted.
   Liquid ammonia-water solution flows in a falling-film mode around an
   array of small diameter coolant tubes, while vapor flows upward through
   the tube array counter-current to the falling film. This absorber was
   installed in a test facility consisting of all components of a
   functional single-effect absorption chiller, including a desorber,
   rectifier, condenser, evaporator, solution heat exchanger, and
   refrigerant precooler, to obtain realistic operating conditions at the
   absorber and to account for the influence of the other components in the
   system. Unlike studies in the literature on bench-top, single-component,
   single-pressure test stands, here the experiments were conducted on the
   absorber at vapor, solution, and coupling fluid conditions
   representative of space-conditioning systems in the heating and cooling
   modes. Absorption measurements were taken over a wide range of solution
   flow rates, concentrations, and coupling fluid temperatures, which
   simulated operation of thermally activated absorption systems at
   different cooling capacities and ambient conditions. These measurements
   are used to interpret the effects of solution and vapor flow rates,

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation has been used clinically to promote bone
   regeneration in cases of fractures with delayed union or nonunion, with
   several in vitro and in vivo reports suggesting its beneficial effects
   on bone formation. However, the use of electrical stimulation of
   titanium (Ti) implants to enhance osseointegration is less understood,
   in part because of the few in vitro models that attempt to represent the
   in vivo environment. In this article, the design of a new in vitro
   system that allows direct electrical stimulation of osteoblasts through
   their Ti substrates without the flow of exogenous currents through the
   media is presented, and the effect of applied electrical polarization on
   osteoblast differentiation and local factor production was evaluated. A
   custom-made polycarbonate tissue culture plate was designed to allow
   electrical connections directly underneath Ti disks placed inside the
   wells, which were supplied with electrical polarization ranging from 100
   to 500mV to stimulate MG63 osteoblasts. Our results show that electrical
   polarization applied directly through Ti substrates on which the cells
   are growing in the absence of applied electrical currents may increase
   osteoblast differentiation and local factor production in a

Abstract = {{Biomass pyrolysis oil has been reported as a potential renewable biofuel
   precursor. Although several review articles focusing on lignocellulose
   pyrolysis can be found, the one that particularly focus on lignin
   pyrolysis is still not available in literature. Lignin is the second
   most abundant biomass component and the primary renewable aromatic
   resource in nature. The pyrolysis chemistry and mechanism of lignin are
   significantly different from pyrolysis of cellulose or entire biomass.
   Therefore, different from other review articles in the field, this
   review particularly focuses on the recent developments in lignin
   pyrolysis chemistry, mechanism, catalysts, and the upgrading of the
   bio-oil from lignin pyrolysis. Although bio-oil production from
   pyrolysis of biomass has been proven on commercial scale and is a very
   promising option for production of renewable chemicals and fuels, there
   are still several drawbacks that have not been solved. The components of
   biomass pyrolysis oils are very complicated and related to the
   properties of bio-oil. In this review article, the details about
   pyrolysis oil components particularly those from lignin pyrolysis
   processes will be discussed first. Due to the poor physical and chemical
   property, the lignin pyrolysis oil has to be upgraded before usage. The
   most common method of upgrading bio-oil is hydrotreating. Catalysts have
   been widely used in petroleum industry for pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading.
   In this review paper, the mechanism of the hydrodeoxygenation reaction
   between the model compounds and catalysts will be discussed and the
   effects of the reaction condition will be summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT)/polymer composites with filler loading close to

   the thermal aging of insulation components. In order to represent the
   real aging conditions of the monitored component, the sensor is made of

   percentage of CNTs and a substantial decrease in resistivity of the
   sensors. The sensors are aged at different temperatures and the
   resistivity change at each temperature is fitted into the modified
   Arrhenius equation to yield the activation energy of the aging
   reactions. The activation energy obtained from the sensor signals is
   similar to those obtained by conventional elongation measurements and
   the thermal evaluation of the insulation component according to IEEE
   standard 275. Therefore, the resistivity value of the sensor can be used
   to accurately predict the remaining life of the monitored parts. These
   sensors provide many advantages over conventional conditioning
   monitoring methods, including no damage to the insulation system,
   real-time monitoring, facile operation, low cost, and much higher
   sensitivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stream processing applications use online analytics to ingest high-rate
   data sources, process them on-the-fly, and generate live results in a
   timely manner. The data flow graph representation of these applications
   facilitates the specification of stream computing tasks with ease, and
   also lends itself to possible runtime exploitation of parallelization on
   multicore processors. While the data flow graphs naturally contain a
   rich set of parallelization opportunities, exploiting them is
   challenging due to the combinatorial number of possible configurations.
   Furthermore, the best configuration is dynamic in nature; it can differ
   across multiple runs of the application, and even during different
   phases of the same run. In this paper, we propose an autopipelining
   solution that can take advantage of multicore processors to improve
   throughput of streaming applications, in an effective and transparent
   way. The solution is effective in the sense that it provides good
   utilization of resources by dynamically finding and exploiting sources
   of pipeline parallelism in streaming applications. It is transparent in
   the sense that it does not require any hints from the application
   developers. As a part of our solution, we describe a light-weight
   runtime profiling scheme to learn resource usage of operators comprising
   the application, an optimization algorithm to locate best places in the
   data flow graph to explore additional parallelism, and an adaptive
   control scheme to find the right level of parallelism. We have
   implemented our solution in an industrial-strength stream processing
   system. Our experimental evaluation based on microbenchmarks, synthetic
   workloads, as well as real-world applications confirms that our design
   is effective in optimizing the throughput of stream processing
   applications without requiring any changes to the application code.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores optimal topologies yielding large band gap shifts in
   one- and two-dimensional nonlinear periodic materials. The presence of a
   nonlinearity in a periodic material system results in
   amplitude-dependent dispersion behavior, leading to novel wave-based
   devices such as tunable filters, resonators, and waveguides. The
   performance of these devices over a broad frequency range requires
   large, tunable band gaps, motivating the present study. Consideration of
   a one-dimensional bilayer system composed of alternating linear and
   nonlinear layers shows that optimal designs consist of thin, compliant
   nonlinear layers. This is at first surprising considering the source of
   the shift originates from only the nonlinear layer; however, thin layers
   lead to localized stresses that activate the nonlinear character of the
   system. This trend persists in two-dimensional materials where
   optimization studies are performed on plane-stress models discretized
   using bilinear Lagrange elements. A fast algorithm is introduced for
   computing the dispersion shifts, enabling efficient parametric analyses
   of two-dimensional inclusion systems. Analogous to the one-dimensional
   system, it is shown that thin ligaments of nonlinear material lead to
   large dispersion shifts and group velocity variations. Optimal
   topologies of the two-dimensional system are also explored using genetic
   algorithms aimed at producing large increases in complete band gap width
   and shift, or group velocity variation, without presupposing the
   topology. The optimal topologies that result resemble the
   two-dimensional inclusion systems, but with small corner features that
   tend to enhance the production of dispersion shift further. Finally, the
   study concludes with a discussion on Bloch wave modes and their
   important role in the production of amplitude-dependent dispersion
   behavior. The results of the study provide insight and guidance on
   selecting topologies and materials which can yield large
   amplitude-dependent band gap shifts and group velocity variations, thus
   enabling sensitive nonlinear devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   performance. The simulation proves that the proposed MPPT algorithm is
   faster, more robust, and adaptive to changes of the environment than the
   conventional variable-step hill climbing search algorithm, while the
   non-MPPT module has a fast dynamic response to the change of the power

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for time-domain analyses using model
   quadratization quadratized model and subsequent quadratic integration of
   the quadratized dynamic-models quadratized model-quadratic integration
   (QMQI) method. The modeling methodology is suitable for analysis of
   power systems with nonlinear components and switching subsystems. The
   quadratic integration (QI) method has been demonstrated to be more
   numerically stable, robust, and accurate than trapezoidal integration
   (TI), one of the most popularly used methods for power transient
   analyses. The model quadratization enables nonlinearities to be modeled
   with equations of nonlinearities no higher than second order without
   approximations or simplifications. Upon QI, the resulting companion form
   is a model with nonlinearities no higher than second order (quadratic
   companion form). Newton's method is employed for the solution of the
   quadratic companion form equations. The numerical convergence of the
   overall method is robust and fast. The performance of the QMQI method is
   quantified with a couple of systems of nonlinear components and power
   electronics. The method can be expanded to cubic integration (CI) as
   well as higher-order integration methods. This paper compares the QMQI
   method with the TI and the CI, for the purpose of determining the pros
   and cons as higher (or lower)-order integration methods are used.}},

Abstract = {{The k-vector search technique is a method designed to perform extremely

   applied to numerous other problem areas including non-uniform random

   inversion, and solution of systems of nonlinear equations. This paper
   presents algorithms in which the k-vector search technique is used to
   solve each of these problems in a computationally-efficient manner. In
   instances where these tasks must be performed repeatedly on a static (or

Title = {{Enabling next generation small cells through femtorelays}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Today's society is driven by ever-growing information needs, which cause
   increased demand for ubiquitous and very high speed wireless
   communications. In search for the urgent need of improved coverage and
   capacity, cellular networks are currently undergoing a major
   transformation from an architecture comprised of thoroughly planned
   macrocell base stations (MBSs) to a much more heterogeneous architecture
   where the macrocell network is underlaid by one or several tiers of
   unevenly deployed small cells. However, this new set of technologies is
   not exempt of several challenges. Backhaul is still an unresolved issue,
   i.e. which is the best technology for the small cell to reach the core
   network. In the case of uncoordinated co-channel deployments where the
   macrocell and small cell tier share the spectrum (e.g. femtocells or
   metrocells), the interference is also a major problem. In this paper, a
   new concept and architecture called femtorelays is introduced as a novel
   solution for next generation small cell problems. A femtorelay is a
   small cell access point that enables improved cellular coverage within
   indoor environments while increasing the overall system capacity through
   spatial frequency reuse. Working as an open-access small cell, it
   provides dual-backhaul connectivity to the core network for registered
   and unregistered users. One of the backhaul connections is the
   internet-based, and the second one is the relay-based operating on the
   spectrum owned by the wireless carrier. The radio interference between
   the macrocell and the small cell is overcome by servicing the macrocell
   interfering users at the femtorelay. Unlike the traffic from
   subscribers, this traffic will be forwarded to the network through the
   relay-based backhaul. The internal architecture, the approach employed
   to make the technology fit in existing networks, and future evolution of
   the basic femtorelays for larger scenarios are also presented. Finally,
   performance results show the potential of this technology to outperform
   other existing solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces two radio-over-fiber (RoF) architectures for the
   future broadband optical-wireless access network-all-band RoF and
   band-mapped 60-GHz RoF that can be integrated in ultra-dense wavelength
   division multiplexing passive optical network (UDWDM-PON). Legacy
   wireless services and multi-gigabit millimeter-wave (mm-wave)
   applications are integrated and delivered simultaneously under one
   shared infrastructure. With centralized system control and signal
   processing, the proposed systems provide cost-effective and
   protocol-transparent solutions for the next-generation multi-service
   bundle in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In the all-band RoF network
   where wireless services are kept at their original carrier frequencies,
   Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 60-GHz high-speed mm-wave services are transmitted
   based on subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) and dual-wavelength heterodyne
   beating techniques in avoidance of optical filters and large-bandwidth
   optoelectronic components. In the indoor environment, the band-mapped
   mm-wave RoF design is illustrated with real-time analog television
   signal, Wi-Fi, and highspeed digital baseband data-all of which are
   transmitted over unified optical and air links. By mapping various
   wireless signals into 60-GHz sub-bands, the novel architecture achieves
   higher spectral efficiency and lower power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating a CPU architecture into CMP, which is more efficient with
   certain types of applications, is a popular architecture trend in recent
   processors. This heterogeneous mix of architectures will use an on-chip
   interconnection to access shared resources such as last-level cache
   tiles and memory controllers. The configuration of this on-chip network
   will likely have a significant impact on resource distribution,
   fairness, and overall performance.
   The heterogeneity of this architecture inevitably exerts different
   pressures on the interconnection due to the differing characteristics
   and requirements of applications running on CPU and GPU cores. CPU
   applications are sensitive to latency, while GPGPU applications require
   massive bandwidth. This is due to the difference in the thread-level
   parallelism of the two architectures. GPUs use more threads to hide the
   effect of memory latency but require massive bandwidth to supply those
   threads. On the other hand, CPU cores typically running only one or two
   threads concurrently are very sensitive to latency.
   This study surveys the impact and behavior of the interconnection
   network when CPU and GPGPU applications run simultaneously. Among our
   findings, we observed that significant interference exists between CPU
   and GPU applications and resource partitioning, in particular virtual
   and physical channel partitioning, shows effectiveness to solve the
   interference problem. Also, heterogeneous link configurations show
   promising results by optimizing traffic hotspots in the network.
   Finally, we evaluated different placement policies and found that how to
   place different components in the network significantly affects the
   performance. Based on these findings, we suggest an optimal ring
   interconnect network. Our study will shed light on other architectural
   interconnection studies on CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper provides some background and historical review of how
   microstructure-sensitive finite element simulations can play a role in
   understanding the effects of stress amplitude, R-ratio, and
   microstructure on fatigue crack formation and early growth at notches,
   including pores and non-metallic inclusions for Ti alloys and Ni-base
   superalloys. The simulations employ fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs)
   computed over finite volumes that relate to processes of fatigue crack
   formation and early growth at the scale of individual grains. It is
   argued that both coarse scale (uncracked, mesoscale) and fine scale FlPs
   (computed in the vicinity of cracks in single grains or crystals) serve
   as a driving force for crystallographic fatigue crack growth, and
   correlate directly with the cyclic crack tip displacement (CTD).
   Furthermore, variability in high cycle fatigue (HCF) and very high cycle
   fatigue (VHCF) responses is computationally assessed using multiple
   statistical volume elements and the distribution of FlPs of extreme
   value character. The concepts of marked correlation functions and
   weighted probability density functions are reviewed as a means to
   quantify the role of multiple microstructure attributes that couple to
   enhance the extreme value FIPs in the HCF regime. An algorithm for
   estimation of the cumulative probability distribution of cycles for
   crack formation and growth from notches in HCF and VHCF is also
   described. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of solid-state nanopore sensors for individual biomolecule
   analysis is a growing topic of interest. A number of recent studies
   demonstrate that engineered nanopore devices (ENDS) can be fabricated by
   electron beam lithography (EBL) with high density (on the order of 10
   devices per cm(2)). The internal pore geometry of ENDs is a critical
   characteristic of the devices, and often obtained by some combination of
   SEM, TEM, AFM, and conductance measurements. However, experimental data
   alone is not sufficient to understand the nanopore geometry under a
   broad set of fabrication conditions. It is necessary to also examine the
   physical basis underlying the EBL-based fabrication of ENDs. In this
   work, the internal pore geometry of ENDs is calculated from electron
   energy distributions in EBL while investigating the effects of dose,
   operating blur, substrate, and dosing pattern. The photoresist is
   ZEP-520 on silicon or silicon nitride substrates. It is found that
   higher beam blur and lower dose cause a greater degree of pore tapering,
   with the most prominent tapering observed in sub-10 nm pores. Nanopores
   in silicon nitride tapered more than those in silicon. The results also
   demonstrate that a combination of blur and dose can be chosen to achieve
   a target tapering angle and pore size at a given depth in the substrate.
   Because the pore tapering angle is non-uniform, the ICP (inductively
   coupled plasma) etch depth may also be used to tune pore size and
   geometry following EBL The resist sensitivity is shown to increase with
   beam blur for pore sizes larger than 10 nm. By comparing to our
   experimental data, it is found that beam intensity measured by the EBL
   instrument may not translate to the operating blur, as is often assumed
   in EBL simulations. Secondary electrons were found to be responsible for
   pore tapering and beam broadening in the resist. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The planning and evaluation of left atrial ablation procedures are
   commonly based on the segmentation of the left atrium, which is a
   challenging task due to large anatomical variations. In this paper, we
   propose an automatic approach for segmenting the left atrium from
   magnetic resonance imagery. The segmentation problem is formulated as a
   problem in variational region growing. In particular, the method starts
   locally by searching for a seed region of the left atrium from an MR
   slice. A global constraint is imposed by applying a shape prior to the
   left atrium represented by Zernike moments. The overall growing process
   is guided by the robust statistics of intensities from the seed region
   along with the shape prior to capture the entire atrial region. The
   robustness and accuracy of our approach are demonstrated by experimental
   results from 64 human MR images.}},

Abstract = {{Material failure due to adiabatic shear banding is a characteristic
   feature of chip formation in machining of Ti-6Al-4V material. In this
   paper, an enhanced Zerilli-Armstrong (Z-A) based material flow stress
   model is developed by accounting for the effects of material failure
   mechanisms such as voids and micro-cracks on the material flow strength
   during shear band formation. These effects are captured via a
   multiplicative failure function in the constitutive material flow stress
   model. The strain and strain rate dependence of the material failure
   mechanism are explicitly modeled via the failure function. The five
   unknown constants of the failure function are calibrated using cutting
   force data and the entire model is verified using separate force, chip
   segmentation frequency and tool-chip contact length data from orthogonal
   cutting experiments reported by Cotterell and Byrne (2008a,b). Model
   predictions of these quantities based on the enhanced material model are
   shown to be in good agreement with experiments over a wide range of
   cutting conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general filtering and unbalance compensation
   scheme for electric traction systems using a direct power control-based
   algorithm. For a balanced three-phase three-wire system, the proposed
   method is able to control the power flow exchange between the grid and
   the load so that the instantaneous complex power is maintained constant.
   As a consequence, any nonlinear unbalanced load is seen by the
   three-phase supply as a balanced linear load. The proposed filter is
   evaluated on power substations with open delta (V-V) and Scott
   transformer feeders, and for two-level and dual-converter in the power
   stage. The scheme has been simulated and experimentally validated. The
   results from experimental and simulation tests show the controller
   advantages and the applicability of the proposed method in railway
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The replicated batch means (RBM) method for steady-state simulation
   output analysis generalizes both the independent replications (IR) and
   batch means (BM) methods. We analyze the performance of RBM in
   situations where the underlying stochastic process possesses an additive
   initial transient. Our analysis differs from prior work in that the
   initial transient is stochastic, and hence the sample paths of the
   transient process may be replication dependent, and possibly also
   correlated across replications. We provide asymptotic expressions for
   the mean and variance of the RBM estimators of the steady-state mean and
   variance parameter of the stochastic process being simulated. We then
   use our results to study the performance of RBM as a function of the
   number of replications, initialization method for the replications, and
   decay rate of the associated initialization bias. Our results provide
   guidance on when IR, BM, or a combination thereof is the best choice,
   and also on effective choices of initial states for the replications.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent article, Diem (2012) examined the impact of the North
   Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) and atmospheric moistening on summer
   rainfall variability in the Atlanta, Georgia region. In his paper, he
   indicated that the results concerning the variability of the NASH
   western ridge discussed in Li et al. (2011) are incorrect. We present
   new evidence here to show that the comments by Diem (2012) are
   unjustified; the main conclusions in Li et al. (2011) were drawn
   according to the data over a 60-year (1948-2007) and 45-year (1958-2002)
   periods of NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40 reanalysis, whereas conclusions of Diem
   (2011) were based upon the trend analysis of a similar but different
   index of the NASH using sub-periods of 1948-2009 (since late 1970s). The
   comment emphases the importance of climate dynamics to study
   precipitation variability over the Southeastern US and further
   strengthens the conclusions originally put forth in Li et al. (2011):
   over the last 60 years (1948-2007), the NASH has shown a significant
   trend of westward movement, and the meridional movement of the NASH
   western-ridge (i.e. its latitudinal change) has enhanced in the recent
   three decades.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of carbon nanotube
   (CNT) forests conformally coated with alumina using atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) are investigated using in situ and ex situ
   micro-indentation. While micro-indentation of a CNT forest coated with a
   thin discontinuous layer using 20 ALD cycles results in a deformation
   response similar to the response of uncoated CNT forests, a similar test
   on a CNT forest coated with a sufficiently thick and continuous layer
   using 100 ALD cycles causes fracture of both the alumina coatings and
   the core CNTs. With a 10 nm coating, 4-fold and 14-fold stiffness
   increases are measured using a flat punch and a Berkovich tip,
   respectively. Indentation testing with the Berkovich tip also reveals
   increased recoverability at relatively low strains. The results show
   that ALD coated CNT forests could be useful for applications that
   require higher stiffness or recoverability. Also, fracturing of the
   nanotubes shows that upper limits exist in the loading of conformally
   coated CNT forests.}},

Abstract = {{A flexible thin-film encapsulation architecture for organic electronics
   was built and consisted of a silicon oxide/alumina and parylene layer
   deposited over Ca sensors on a barrier-coated polyethylene terephthalate
   substrate. The film's effective water vapor transmission rate was 2.4
   +/- 1.5 x 10(-5) g/m(2)/ day at 20 degrees C and 50\% relative humidity.
   Flexural tests revealed that for films deposited on the polyethylene
   terephthalate substrate, the barrier layer failed due to cracking at a
   curvature radius of 6.4 mm, corresponding to a strain of 0.8\%. Adding
   an epoxy top coat of suitable thickness shifted the neutral axis toward
   the encapsulation layer, reducing the induced strain. Barrier
   performance was maintained under the 6.4 mm radius of curvature in this
   encapsulation structure. Thus, shifting the neutral axis via device
   structural design is an effective method of extending the flexibility of
   thin-film encapsulation structure without compromising the performance
   loss as a barrier layer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{From GRID to gridlock: the relationship between scientific biomedical
   breakthroughs and HIV/AIDS policy in the US Congress}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: From the travel ban on people living with HIV (PLHIV) to
   resistance to needle exchange programmes, there are many examples where
   policy responses to HIV/AIDS in the United States seem divorced from
   behavioural, public health and sociological evidence. At its root,
   however, the unknowns about HIV/AIDS lie at biomedical science, and
   scientific researchers have made tremendous progress over the past 30
   years of the epidemic by using antiretroviral therapy to increase the
   life expectancy of PLHIV almost to the same level as non-infected
   individuals; but a relationship between biomedical science discoveries
   and congressional responses to HIV/AIDS has not been studied. Using
   quantitative approaches, we directly examine the hypothesis that
   progress in HIV/AIDS biomedical science discoveries would have a
   correlative relationship with congressional response to HIV/AIDS from
   1981 to 2010.
   Methods: This study used original data on every bill introduced, hearing
   held and law passed by the US Congress relating to HIV/AIDS over 30
   years (1981-2010). We combined congressional data with the most cited
   and impactful biomedical research scientific publications over the same
   time period as a metric of biomedical science breakthroughs.
   Correlations between congressional policy and biomedical research were
   then analyzed at the aggregate and individual levels.
   Results: Biomedical research advancements helped shape both the level
   and content of bill sponsorship on HIV/AIDS, but they had no effect on
   other stages of the legislative process. Examination of the content of
   bills and biomedical research indicated that science helped transform
   HIV/AIDS bill sponsorship from a niche concern of liberal Democrats to a
   bipartisan coalition when Republicans became the majority party. The
   trade-off for that expansion has been an emphasis on the global epidemic
   to the detriment of domestic policies and programmes.
   Conclusions: Breakthroughs in biomedical science did associate with the
   number and types of HIV/AIDS bills introduced in Congress, but that
   relationship did not extend to the passage of laws or to hearings. When
   science matters, it cannot be separated from political considerations.
   An important implication of our work has been the depoliticizing role
   that science can play. Scientific breakthroughs helped to transform
   HIV/AIDS policy from a niche of liberal Democrats into bipartisan
   support for the global fight against the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a wireless and wearable assistive
   technology, designed to allow individuals with severe motor impairments
   such as tetraplegia to access their environment using voluntary tongue
   motion. Previous TDS trials used a magnetic tracer temporarily attached
   to the top surface of the tongue with tissue adhesive. We investigated
   TDS efficacy for controlling a computer and driving a powered wheelchair
   in two groups of able-bodied subjects and a group of volunteers with
   spinal cord injury (SCI) at C6 or above. All participants received a
   magnetic tongue barbell and used the TDS for five to six consecutive
   sessions. The performance of the group was compared for TDS versus
   keypad and TDS versus a sip-and-puff device (SnP) using accepted
   measures of speed and accuracy. All performance measures improved over
   the course of the trial. The gap between keypad and TDS performance
   narrowed for able-bodied subjects. Despite participants with SCI already
   having familiarity with the SnP, their performance measures were up to
   three times better with the TDS than with the SnP and continued to
   improve. TDS flexibility and the inherent characteristics of the human
   tongue enabled individuals with high-level motor impairments to access
   computers and drive wheelchairs at speeds that were faster than
   traditional assistive technologies but with comparable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix mechanics controls cell fate by modulating the bonds between
   integrins and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. However, it remains
   unclear how fibronectin (FN), type 1 collagen, and their receptor
   integrin subtypes distinctly control force transmission to regulate
   focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity, a crucial molecular signal
   governing cell adhesion/migration. Here we showed, using a genetically
   encoded FAK biosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer,
   that FN-mediated FAK activation is dependent on the mechanical tension,
   which may expose its otherwise hidden FN synergy site to integrin alpha
   5. In sharp contrast, the ligation between the constitutively exposed
   binding motif of type 1 collagen and its receptor integrin alpha 2 was
   surprisingly tension-independent to induce sufficient FAK activation.
   Although integrin alpha subunit determines mechanosensitivity, the
   ligation between alpha subunit and the ECM proteins converges at the
   integrin beta 1 activation to induce FAK activation. We further
   discovered that the interaction of the N-terminal protein
   4.1/ezrin/redixin/moesin basic patch with phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-biphosphate is crucial during cell adhesion to maintain the FAK
   activation from the inhibitory effect of nearby protein
   4.1/ezrin/redixin/moesin acidic sites. Therefore, different ECM proteins
   either can transmit or can shield from mechanical forces to regulate
   cellular functions, with the accessibility of ECM binding motifs by
   their specific integrin alpha subunits determining the biophysical
   mechanisms of FAK activation during mechanotransduction.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first syntheses of three-dimensional (3D) nanocrystalline
   all-oxide replicas of pollen microparticles tailored for multimodal
   (bioenabled and synthetic) adhesion via use of a scalable, highly
   conformal surface sol-gel (SSG) coating process. High-fidelity
   replication allowed the pollen-shaped oxide microparticles to be
   utilized for adhesion via tailorable short-range (similar to 10 nm) van
   der Waals (VDW) attraction, with the magnitude of such VDW-based
   adhesion influenced by the nanoscale topography of surface features
   retained by the replicas. Conversion of the pollen into ferrimagnetic
   (Fe3O4) microparticle replicas allowed the use of magnetic attraction at
   short and long ranges (up to similar to 1 mm). By selecting pollen
   particles with particular surface features and by SSG-enabled conversion
   of such pollen into 3D nanocrystalline replicas composed of an
   appropriate type and amount of magnetic oxide, adhesive microparticles
   with tunable short- and long-range attractive forces can be generated.}},
