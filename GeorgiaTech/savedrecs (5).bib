Abstract = {{An improved model for the estimation of the breakdown voltages of gas
   mixtures is developed. The application and utility of the model is
   demonstrated by using it in estimating the breakdown voltages of gas
   mixtures containing helium and hydrogen that are being developed as an
   alternative cryogenic insulation and cooling media for certain high
   temperature superconducting (HTS) power devices. The concept of the
   developed model, which incorporates a generalization factor m, is
   presented. The first step of the model performs a nonlinear least square
   regression on the generalized formula of the pressure normalized
   ionization coefficient alpha/p for the parameter approximation. The
   second step introduces the parameter m that minimizes the root mean
   square error (RMSE) of the nonlinear least square regression to derive
   the versatile model. The validity of the model is demonstrated by
   comparing its estimated values with the results of the experimental
   breakdown measurements of several gas mixtures. Compared to the
   conventional breakdown voltage models, the new model showed improved
   agreement with the experimental results of the breakdown voltages.}},

Abstract = {{The GraphBLAS standard (GraphBlas.org) is being developed to bring the
   potential of matrix-based graph algorithms to the broadest possible
   audience. Mathematically, the GraphBLAS defines a core set of
   matrix-based graph operations that can be used to implement a wide dass
   of graph algorithms in a wide range of programming environments. This
   paper provides an introduction to the mathematics of the GraphBLAS.
   Graphs represent connections between vertices with edges. Matrices can
   represent a wide range of graphs using adjacency matrices or incidence
   matrices. Adjacency matrices are often easier to analyze while incidence
   matrices are orten beUer for representing data. Fortunately, the two are
   easily connected by matrix multiplication. A key feature of matrix
   mathematics is that a very small number of matrix operations can be used
   to manipulate a very wide range of graphs. This composability of a small
   number of operations is the foundation of the GraphBLAS. A standard such
   as the GraphBLAS can only be efTective if it has low performance
   overhead. Performance measurements of prototype GraphBLAS
   implementations indicate that the overhead is low.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research projects have investigated partitioning, acceleration,
   and data reduction techniques for improving the performance of Breadth
   First Search (BFS) and the related HPC benchmark, Graph500. However, few
   implementations have focused on cloud-based systems like Amazon's Web
   Services, which differ from HPC systems in several ways, most
   importantly in terms of network interconnect.
   This work looks at optimizations to reduce the communication overhead of
   an accelerated, distributed BFS on an HPC system and a smaller
   cloud-like system that contains GPUs. We demonstrate the effects of an
   efficient 2D partitioning scheme and allreduce implementation, as well
   as different CPU-based compression schemes for reducing the overall
   amount of data shared between nodes. Timing and Score-P profiling
   results demonstrate a dramatic reduction in row and column frontier
   queue data (up to 91\%) and show how compression can improve performance
   for a bandwidth-limited cluster.}},

Abstract = {{We address practical limits of energy efficiency scaling for logic and
   memory. Scaling of logic will end with unreliable operation, making
   computers probabilistic as a side effect. The errors can be corrected or
   tolerated, but overhead will increase with further scaling. We address
   the tradeoff between scaling and error correction that yields minimum
   energy per operation, finding new error correction methods with energy
   consumption limits about 2x below current approaches. The maximum energy
   efficiency for memory depends on several other factors. Adiabatic and
   reversible methods applied to logic have promise, but overheads have
   precluded practical use. However, the regular array structure of memory
   arrays tends to reduce overhead and makes adiabatic memory a viable
   option. This paper reports an adiabatic memory that has been tested at
   about 85x improvement over standard designs for energy efficiency.
   Combining these approaches could set energy efficiency expectations for
   processor-in-memory computing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Dennard scaling has ended. Lowering the voltage supply (Vdd) to sub volt
   levels causes intermittent losses in signal integrity, rendering further
   scaling (down) no longer acceptable as a means to lower the power
   required by a processor core. However, if it were possible to recover
   the occasional losses due to lower Vdd in an efficient manner, one could
   effectively lower power. In other words, by deploying the right amount
   and kind of redundancy, we can strike a balance between overhead
   incurred in achieving reliability and savings realized by permitting
   lower Vdd. One promising approach is the Redundant Residue Number System
   (RRNS) representation. Unlike other error correcting codes, RRNS has the
   important property of being closed under addition, subtraction and
   multiplication. Thus enabling correction of errors caused due to both
   faulty storage and compute units. Furthermore, the incorporated approach
   uses a fraction of the overhead and is more efficient when compared to
   the conventional technique used for compute-reliability.
   In this article, we provide an overview of the architecture of a CREEPY
   core that leverages this property of RRNS and discuss associated
   algorithms such as error detection/correction, arithmetic overflow
   detection and signed number representation. Finally, we demonstrate the
   usability of such a computer by quantifying a performance-reliability
   trade-off and provide a lower bound measure of tolerable input signal
   energy at a gate, while still maintaining reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) is essential to the everyday
   operations of many manufacturing facilities. CAM software is used to aid
   in the manufacturing of a part by converting a computer model into
   instructions for a machine tool. Most frequently, CAM is used to
   generate G-Code, which is the standard programming language of CNC
   turning and milling machines. While CAM software greatly simplifies the
   process of converting a part model to G-Code, it still requires
   experience to learn to use properly. Additionally, a powerful
   workstation is required to run the CAM software, which can be
   inconvenient due to its cost and size. Many organizations have been
   turning to virtualization as an alternative to multiple standalone
   workstations; virtualization allows for many users to access desktop
   environments that are hosted from a remote server. This has the benefit
   of isolating the user from both OS and hardware requirements for certain
   software, and also allows them to run the applications they need from
   anywhere. This research explores the emerging area of virtualized
   general purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU); this
   technique is used to support the use of a novel and easy-to-use CAM
   package that leverages the parallel computation capability of a GPU.
   Virtualization can allow for both lower implementation costs for a large
   number of users and lowered support requirements, as the GPUs and other
   computing hardware are consolidated in one location. Preliminary results
   show performance losses due to hardware abstraction inherent in
   virtualization. However, these losses are overshadowed by the ease of
   deployment of the CAM system to users.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are currently used extensively in medical
   and dental applications due to their superior mechanical and physical
   properties compared to coarse-grained (CG) Ti. However, the presence of
   alloying elements such as aluminum and vanadium has raised concerns
   about Ti alloy biocompatibility. Fortunately, equal channel angular
   extrusion (ECAE)-processed ultrafine-grained (UFG) Ti, which has a grain
   structure on the submicron level, has emerged as a viable alternative.
   The substantial reduction in grain size results in distinct material
   property differences, which may affect the dynamic material behavior. In
   this study, the chip morphology, which is an indication of the dynamic
   behavior of materials, of ECAE-processed Ti after machining is evaluated
   and compared with that of CG Ti. The chip morphology for both Ti
   materials is found to transform as the cutting speed increases while
   ECAE Ti has a different shear band spacing, indicating that ECAE Ti
   responds differently to deformation when compared with CG Ti.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in digital image analysis have allowed for rapid and detailed
   investigations of themicrostructural topography of cementitious
   materials, and recent theoretical and analytical work have allowed for
   recovery of 3D information from 2D analyses. However, measurements of
   parameters such as the entrained air void size distribution and number
   density obtained fromdigital images of concrete are sensitive to the
   resolution of the image. To address this, an analyticalmodel for
   recovering 3D information from 2D sectionswas applied to images of
   air-entrainedmortar at different resolutions, and the results were
   interpreted in terms of fractal geometry. It is shown that there exists
   a ``cutoff{''} resolution for scale independence, which is crucial for
   viewing stereological measurements in an absolute sense rather than
   relative to the resolution of the instrument used to acquire them. For
   the analysis of entrained air void structure, this cutoff resolution is
   around 3200 DPI; for such analyses, it is recommended that images be
   acquired at this resolution. Furthermore, the same analytical model was
   validated against full 3DX-ray microtomographic images.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{8362-8374}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic adaptive streaming technique flexibly adapts the video
   bit-rate to link fluctuations, which can improve the quality of
   experience (QoE). In this paper, we present a systematic framework of
   video streaming in the context of information-centric networking, in
   order to facilitate the largescale deployment of the dynamic adaptive
   streaming technique. Specifically, we design the network as a two-layer
   coordinating structure, namely, the control layer and the transmission
   layer. The control layer employs the statistical data recorders to
   record the variations of the video popularity, link states, and user
   demands. On the other side, the network forwards user requests and
   caches data packets in the transmission layer, based on the statistical
   data which is obtained in the control layer. In addition, the network
   executes the real-time monitoring of link conditions in the transmission
   layer, and adjusts the video bit-rate accordingly. Under the above
   feedback circumstance, we first develop a distributed algorithm of joint
   dynamic forwarding and caching to theoretically maximize the total user
   demand rates within the network stability region. Then, we modify the
   distributed algorithm with a practical caching strategy to make the
   system applicable to real scenarios. Simulation results show the
   superior performance of the modified distributed algorithm in terms of
   low user delay and high QoE performance.}},

   which already offers powerful, modular abstractions for network
   operators; however, Ryuretic also builds on Ryu's greater variety of
   packet match fields and its access to advanced OpenFlow protocols. This
   framework allows programmers to create new, extensible, and more
   powerful network applications at a much higher level of abstraction. As
   Pyretic does with POX, Ryuretic places an additional abstraction layer
   over the Ryu framework for network application development.
   Additionally, its abstractions allow researchers to target specific
   layers of the OSI model and install both proactive and reactive rule
   sets, without immersing themselves in the Ryu architecture. Ryuretic is
   under continual development, and it is available to users via GitHub.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturized gas sensors are increasingly important to monitor the
   quality of air in a wide range of human environments. Semiconductor
   metal oxides have proved to be a useful family of materials, in this
   direction. Unfortunately, metal oxide sensors need a high temperature to
   respond to any target gas. In order to work around this limit, we
   fabricate hybrid sensors consisting in single zinc oxide microbelts
   decorated with organic molecules. Fluorinated tetraphenylporphyrin
   (H2TTPF) is deposited via supersonic molecular beam and considerably
   improve the performance of the microsensor. The microdevice is
   investigated with XRD, SEM and AFM techniques. While the as-is ZnO
   microbelt shows no response up to 150 degrees C, the H2TTPF decorated
   microsensor shows a clear and quick response even at 75 degrees C. (C)

Abstract = {{Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injections (HCI) are
   two of the main effects that increase a transistor's threshold voltage
   and further cause performance degradations. These two wearout mechanisms
   affect all transistors, but are especially acute in the SRAM cells of
   first-level (L1) caches, which are frequently accessed and are critical
   for microprocessor performance. This work studies the cache lifetimes
   due to the combined effect of BTI and HCI for different cache
   configurations, including variation in cache size, associativity, cache
   line size, and the replacement algorithm. The effect of process
   variations is also considered. We analyze the reliability (failure
   probability) and performance (hit rate) of the L1 cache within a LEON3
   microprocessor, while the LEON3 is running a set of benchmarks, and we
   provide essential insights on performance-reliability tradeoffs for
   cache designers.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new strategy for coupling the parallel in time (parareal)
   iterative methodology with multiscale integrators. Following the
   parareal framework, the algorithm computes a low-cost approximation of
   all slow variables in the system using an appropriate multiscale
   integrator, which is refined using parallel fine scale integrations.
   Convergence is obtained using an alignment algorithm for fast phase-like
   variables. The method may be used either to enhance the accuracy and
   range of applicability of the multiscale method in approximating only
   the slow variables, or to resolve all the state variables. The numerical
   scheme does not require that the system is split into slow and fast
   coordinates. Moreover, the dynamics may involve hidden slow variables,
   for example, due to resonances. We propose an alignment algorithm for
   almost-periodic solutions, in which case convergence of the parareal
   iterations is proved. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in
   numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of DRAM caches for multi-node systems.
   Current systems architect the DRAM cache as Memory-Side Cache (MSC),
   restricting the DRAM cache to cache only the local data, and relying on
   only the small on-die caches for the remote data. As MSC keeps only the
   local data, it is implicitly coherent and obviates the need of any
   coherence support. Unfortunately, as accessing the data in the remote
   node incurs a significant inter-node network latency, MSC suffers from
   such latency overhead on every on-die cache miss to the remote data. A
   desirable alternative is to allow the DRAM cache to cache both the local
   and the remote data. However, as data blocks can be cached in multiple
   DRAM caches, this design requires coherence support for DRAM caches to
   ensure correctness, and is termed Coherent DRAM Cache (CDC).
   We identify two key challenges in architecting giga-scale CDC. First,
   the coherence directory can be as large as few tens of MB. Second, cache
   misses to the read-write shared data in CDC cause longer delay due to
   the need to access the DRAM cache. To address both problems, this paper
   proposes CANDY, a low-cost and scalable solution that consists of two
   techniques for these challenges. First, CANDY places the coherence
   directory in 3D DRAM to avoid SRAM storage overhead, and re-purposes the
   existing on-die coherence directory as a DRAM-cache Coherence Buffer to
   cache recently accessed directory entries. Second, we propose
   Sharing-Aware Bypass, which dynamically detects the read-write shared
   data at run-time and enforces such data to bypass the DRAM cache. Our
   experiment on a 4-node system with 1GB DRAM cache per node shows that
   CANDY outperforms MSC by 25\%, while incurring a negligible overhead of
   8KB per node. CANDY is within 5\% of an impractical system that has a
   64MB SRAM directory per node, and zero cache latency to access the
   read-write shared data.}},

Abstract = {{We present a methodology for algorithmic generation of test signals for
   the detection and diagnosis of a variety of short and open-circuit
   defects in analog circuits. Prior algorithms have focused on test
   generation for known short or open defect values. This places the burden
   of failure coverage on accurate analysis of observed defects in known
   failed parts at high cost. In this work, we optimize the test stimulus
   to detect the weakest shorts and opens in analog circuits using a
   concurrent stimulus and defect value optimization algorithm. Since the
   defect value itself is an optimization parameter, the responses of
   nonlinear circuits corresponding to multiple defect values are
   considered as opposed to a single linearized representation
   corresponding to a fixed defect value as in the existing state of the
   art. The algorithm produces a test stimulus along with the values of the
   weakest shorts and opens that the stimulus can detect (the locations of
   the defects are specified to the algorithm). These values are determined
   by the design of the analog circuit itself and therefore subsume all
   specified detectable defects for the circuits concerned. Experimental
   results show the feasibility of the proposed approach on selected test
   cases and defect sets.}},

   volumes. Roughly speaking, HDTs combine dense volumetric grids with
   sparse octrees in a way that makes them both more compact and
   better-suited to GPUs than state-of-the-art alternatives. For our
   motivating applications in computer-aided design and manufacturing
   (CAD/CAM), we show 2x reductions in storage on realistic inputs compared
   to these alternatives; additionally, we show up to 16x speedups over
   multicore CPU implementations on a specific computational bottleneck
   known as an offset surface computation. Indeed, these combined
   improvements allow us to perform offsetting on a single node at
   resolutions well-beyond that of the prior work and the capabilities of
   current commercial packages. And beyond CAD/CAM, HDTs may find
   applications in 3D geometric modeling problems for a variety of domains,
   including medical imaging and graphics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the acceleration of applications that require
   searching for all occurrences of thousands of string-patterns in an
   input data-stream, using the Automata Processor (AP). For this purpose,
   we use two applications from two fields, namely, network security and
   bioinformatics. The first application, called Fast-SNAP (for Fast-SNort
   using AP), scans network data for 4312 signatures of intrusion derived
   from the popular open-source Snort database. Using the resources of a
   single AP board, Fast-SNAP can scan for all these signatures at 10.3
   Gbps. The second application, called PROTOMATA (for PROTein autOMATA),
   looks for all occurrences of 1308 protein motifs from the PROSITE
   database in protein sequences. PROTOMATA is up to half a million times
   faster than its single-CPU-based counterpart. The techniques developed
   to program these applications may be useful in the design and
   development of similar applications using this new hardware accelerator.}},

Abstract = {{We present a semi-empirical model for analyzing where a program spends
   its energy. This model combines measured features of an application,
   such as its instruction mix, with measured costs of the platform, such
   as the energy per operation specialized to different operations. The
   model permits costs to vary with voltage and frequency, as they would on
   platforms that support dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Our
   experiments indicate that the model accurately predicts the energy
   consumption of both microbenchmarks and a proxy application, which
   implements the fast multipole method for n-body problems. It is accurate
   enough to identify near-optimal voltage and frequency settings that
   maximize energy efficiency and permits an analysis of where potential
   hardware and software energy bottlenecks might be in our proxy
   application. We believe our overall methodology could be applied more
   broadly by other performance analysts.}},

   stochastic MIP solver that takes advantage of parallelism at multiple

   instances from the SIPLIB benchmark by combining methods known for

Abstract = {{It has been observed that many networks arising in practice have skewed
   node degree distributions. Scale-free networks are one well-known class
   of such networks. Achieving efficient parallel simulation of scale-free
   networks is challenging because large-degree nodes can create
   bottlenecks that limit performance. To help address this problem we
   describe an approach called link partitioning where each network link is
   mapped to a logical process (LP) in contrast to the conventional
   approach of mapping each network node to an LP. Link partitioning is
   discussed in the context of packet-level simulations of
   telecommunication networks. The parallelism of link partitioning
   relative to node partitioning is examined in terms of an idealized
   execution using the well-known YAWNS synchronization algorithm. Further,
   a critical path analysis suggests that there is much more parallelism
   available in these simulations than can be exploited using the YAWNS
   algorithm.}},

   p-refinement on domain meshed with differently shaped cells. The

   adjacent cells for the tangent and normal vector component in the
   curl-and in the divergence-conforming case, respectively. The polynomial
   order of the functions may vary from cell to cell to facilitate

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a new approach to build 3D reconfigurable

   reconfigurable helical antenna based on microfluidics and liquid metal

   technique, 3D microfluidic channel can be fabricated in a short
   production cycle cost-effectively. EGaIn, a non-toxic LMA, is filled
   into a 3D printed helix channel and form the helical antenna. As the
   gain of the antenna is determined by the number of turns of the helix
   which is controlled by the volume of LMA, the gain of the antenna can be
   tuned when needed. A more than 4 dB gain increase around 5 GHz is
   measured with the prototype when the number of turns of helix increases
   from 2 to 8 (0.2 mL LMA volume change), which demonstrates the
   reconfigurability of the proposed helical antenna.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents modeling of diffraction loss caused by dielectric
   circular cylinders obstructing the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path at the
   center frequency of D-band (140 GHz). Uniform Geometrical Theory of
   Diffraction (UTD) approach to the problem in order to predict the
   diffraction loss introduced by a coffee mug on a desktop is
   investigated. The results are compared with D-band measurements with
   very good agreement between them, which confirms the existence of rays
   that diffract off the convex surfaces of the cylinder. The finding can
   be extended to Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios for indoor environment
   with moving persons as studies have shown that human torso can be
   modeled with a cylinder filled with salt water. The results can
   contribute to the accurate modeling of future high-data-rate D-band
   indoor channels by predicting the loss caused by signals obstructed by
   human bodies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multi-feed antenna structure that synthesizes the
   desired radiation characteristics with antenna-level power combining.
   Compared with an antenna array that spatially combines the radiation
   E-field and H-field at the far-field, the proposed multi-feed antenna
   combines the radiation power from different feeds directly on the
   antenna. Such a unique structure occupies a much smaller footprint and
   offers the flexibility to optimize the antenna driving impedances based
   on the locations of the antenna feeds. As two proof-of-concept designs,
   a two-feed 0.5 lambda slot antenna and a three-feed 0.7 lambda slot
   antenna with the input feeding networks are designed at 10.3GHz. A
   conventional single-feed 0.5 lambda slot antenna and a single-feed 0.7
   lambda slot antenna are also implemented as the reference designs. Well
   matched radiation patterns between the proposed multi-feed antennas and
   the conventional single-feed antennas are observed, demonstrating the
   antenna-level power combining capability of the proposed multi-feed
   antennas.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition have the potential to
   improve the thermal management and reliability of AlGaN/GaN high
   electron mobility transistors. The integration of CVD diamond with GaN
   involves the nucleation and growth of diamond films on GaN which induces
   a vertical gradient in thermal conductivity of the diamond and can
   result in bulk properties that depend greatly on growth conditions. Thus
   accurate characterization of the thermal conductivity of CVD diamond,
   especially the lower conductivity near the growth interface is needed to
   assess the impact on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. In this work, we present
   measurements of the thickness dependence of CVD diamond with thicknesses
   ranging from 5 to 13.8 mu m in addition to bulk diamond substrates using
   time domain thermoreflectance. Measurements were made on the same
   samples in two different laboratories which showed excellent correlation
   between the measurements. The diamond properties were then utilized in a
   thermal model of a 10 finger AlGaN/GaN HEMT to predict the impact of
   device junction temperature. Compared to a device made on SiC operating
   at 5 W/mm, a junction temperature reduction of 30-40\% was seen when
   using CVD diamond and the same device size}},

Abstract = {{In short-circuit studies, load makes difficult to determine fault
   current that flows in positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence networks.
   Therefore, it is often ignored because the magnitude of load current is
   much less than that of fault current that flows from generators when a
   fault occurs. As distributed generation (DG) resources such as
   photovoltaic systems, wind farms, and non-linear generators based on
   power electronics have being deployed into power system networks, load
   current that flows from them may affect a magnitude of fault current.
   Thus, the objective of this study is to develop a short-circuit
   algorithm that analyzes the effect of load current on fault current. For
   this purpose, using the bus impedance matrix and the iterative current
   compensation method presented in {[}1], this study initially develops a
   power-flow analysis algorithm that iterates to calculate current to be
   injected and determines voltage. Then, the proposed short-circuit
   algorithm uses as input data the results of power-flow calculation. To
   verify the algorithms developed in MATLAB, a distribution system with a
   DG resource is presented in a case study. Then, this study (a)
   calculates the power flow of the distribution system, (b) generates a
   single line-to-ground fault, and (c) changes the capacity of load, the
   capacity of a DG resource, and the location of a fault. Finally, it
   examines the effect of load and DG on a magnitude of fault current.}},

Abstract = {{Maximizing data locality in task scheduling is critical for the
   performance of MapReduce job execution. Many existing works on MapReduce
   scheduling decide the placement of map and reduce tasks on a coarse
   granularity of locations measured by located machines and racks. They do
   not explicitly consider the network topology and data transmission cost,
   which may cause task straggling and degrade the job performance. In
   order to improve MapReduce job performance, in this paper, we consider
   the task placement with the goal of minimizing the overall data
   transmission cost for a job execution while balancing the transmission
   cost reduction and resource utilization. We propose a probabilistic
   network-aware scheduling algorithm that selects a task (map task or
   reduce task) to be scheduled on a given available task slot that leads
   to the minimum transmission cost among the task candidates, and then
   schedule the selected task on the slot with a probability determined by
   its transmission cost; a lower expected transmission cost leads to a
   higher probability and vice versa. We also propose a method to more
   accurately estimate the intermediate data size based on the progress of
   map tasks, which is needed to calculate the transmission cost of reduce
   tasks but is unknown at the time of reduce task scheduling. We implement
   our probabilistic network-aware scheduling algorithm on Apache Hadoop
   and conduct experiments on a high-performance computing platform. The
   experimental results show that our scheduling algorithm outperforms the
   previous approaches in terms of job completion time and cluster resource
   utilization.}},

   workflows, it is challenging to obtain consistently high I/O throughput
   because its I/O efficiency can be compromised for serving write and read
   requests simultaneously. This issue is so-called write-read
   interference. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme named
   FlashStager, which can isolate writes from reads using write redirection
   to improve data staging performance of SSDs by minimizing the write-read
   interference. Not only can it detect the interference, but also evaluate
   whether it is cost-effective to resolve it by executing the write
   redirection according to its correlation with write ratio and request
   size. Our experiments with both micro-benchmarks and real scientific
   applications show than FlashStager can improve I/O performance of
   staging by 40\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{While Boolean logic has been the backbone of information processing,
   there are computationally hard problems like optimization and
   classification wherein this conventional paradigm is less efficient.
   This motivates us to explore new pathways to their solution. In this
   invited talk, we describe an experimental testbed using coupled
   relaxation oscillator arrays that exploit the insulator- metal phase
   transitions in the correlated material, vanadium dioxide (VO2), to
   realize a chip scale coupled dynamical system. Our work is inspired by
   the understanding that associative computing finds a natural analogue in
   the energy minimization processes embedded within the spatiotemporal
   dynamics of coupled systems. Our work not only elucidates a
   physics-based computing method but also presents opportunities for
   customized co-processors for solving computationally hard problems
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Co-expression network is a critical technique for the identification of
   inter-gene interactions, which usually relies on all-pairs correlation
   (or similar measure) computation between gene expression profiles across
   multiple samples. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) is one widely
   used technique for gene co-expression network construction. However,
   allpairs PCC computation is computationally demanding for large numbers
   of gene expression profiles, thus motivating our acceleration of its
   execution using high-performance computing. In this paper, we present
   LightPCC, the first parallel and distributed all-pairs PCC computation
   on Intel Xeon Phi (Phi) clusters. It achieves high speed by exploring
   the SIMD-instruction- level and thread-level parallelism within Phis as
   well as accelerator-level parallelism among multiple Phis. To facilitate
   balanced workload distribution, we have proposed a general framework for
   symmetric all-pairs computation by building bijective functions between
   job identifier and coordinate space for the first time. We have
   evaluated LightPCC and compared it to two CPU-based counterparts: a
   sequential C++ implementation in ALGLIB and an implementation based on a
   parallel general matrix-matrix multiplication routine in Intel Math
   Kernel Library (MKL) (all use double precision), using a set of gene
   expression datasets. Performance evaluation revealed that with one 5110P
   Phi and 16 Phis, LightPCC runs up to 20.6x and 218.2x faster than
   ALGLIB, and up to 6.8x and 71.4x faster than single-threaded MKL,
   respectively. In addition, LightPCC demonstrated good parallel
   scalability in terms of number of Phis.}},

Abstract = {{Technology scaling along with unprecedented levels of device integration
   has led to increasing numbers of analog/mixed-signal/RF design bugs
   escaping into silicon. Such bugs are manifested under specific
   system-on-chip (SoC) operating conditions and their effects are
   difficult to predict a-priori. This paper describes recent advances in
   detecting and diagnosing such bugs using ``guided{''} stochastic test
   stimulus generation algorithms. A key challenge is that unlike
   traditional test generation for manufacturing test that is predicated on
   known failure mechanisms, the nature of design bugs is generally unknown
   and must be discovered on-the-fly. Classes of design errors from
   undesired capacitive coupling and incorrect biasing conditions to
   incorrect guard-banding of designs are considered. It is shown that high
   design bug coverage can be obtained over a range of test cases.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of third-party silicon manufacturing has increased the
   vulnerability of integrated circuits to malicious insertion of hardware
   for the purpose of leaking secret information or even rendering the
   circuits useless while deployed in the field. A key goal is to detect
   the presence of such circuits before they are activated for subversive
   reasons. One way to achieve this is to detect the presence of parasitic
   loads on internal nodes of a victim circuit. However, such detection
   becomes difficult in the presence of normal process variations of the
   silicon manufacturing process itself. In this work, we show how
   high-resolution detection of parasitic loads on internal circuit nodes
   can be achieved using a combination of test stimulus design and
   design-for-Trojan detection techniques. We illustrate our ideas on
   digital as well as analog/mixed-signal circuits and point to directions

Abstract = {{As the exascale computing age emerges, data related issues are becoming
   critical factors that determine how and where we do computing. Popular
   approaches used by traditional I/O solution and storage libraries become
   increasingly bottlenecked due to their assumptions about data movement,
   re-organization, and storage. While, new technologies, such as. burst
   buffers., can help address some of the short-term performance issues, it
   is essential that we reexamine the underlying storage and I/O
   infrastructure to effectively support requirements and challenges at
   exascale and beyond. In this paper we present a new approach to the
   exascale Storage System and I/O (SSIO), which is based on allowing users
   to inject application knowledge into the system and leverage this
   knowledge to better manage, store, and access large data volumes so as
   to minimize the time to scientific insights. Central to our approach is
   the distinction between the data, metadata, and the knowledge contained

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide faster algorithms for computing various
   fundamental quantities associated with random walks on a directed graph,
   including the stationary distribution, personalized PageRank vectors,
   hitting times, and escape probabilities. In particular, on a directed
   graph with n vertices and m edges, we show how to compute each quantity
   in time (O) over tilde (m(3/4) n + mn(2/3)), where the (O) over tilde
   notation suppresses polylog factors in n, the desired accuracy, and the
   appropriate condition number (i.e. the mixing time or restart
   probability).
   Our result improves upon the previous fastest running times for these
   problems; previous results either invoke a general purpose linear system
   solver on a n x n matrix with m non-zero entries, or depend polynomially
   on the desired error or natural condition number associated with the
   problem (i.e. the mixing time or restart probability). For sparse
   graphs, we obtain a running time of (O) over tilde (n(7/4)), breaking
   the O(n(2)) barrier of the best running time one could hope to achieve
   using fast matrix multiplication.
   We achieve our result by providing a similar running time improvement
   for solving directed Laplacian systems, a natural directed or asymmetric
   analog of the well studied symmetric or undirected Laplacian systems. We
   show how to solve such systems in time (O) over tilde (m(3/4) n +
   mn(2/3)), and efficiently reduce a broad range of problems to solving
   (O) over tilde (1) directed Laplacian systems on Eulerian graphs. We
   hope these results and our analysis open the door for further study into
   directed spectral graph theory.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetic recording promises to increase areal density
   through the joint detection of multiple tracks of interest. This paper
   concerns the problem of joint detection of multiple tracks that are
   written asynchronously, meaning that neither the bit boundaries (phase)
   nor the bit rate (frequency) are aligned between neighboring tracks. We
   propose the rotating-target (ROTAR) algorithm for jointly detecting
   multiple asynchronous tracks from one or more readback waveforms. The
   proposed approach is based on the joint Viterbi algorithm and a
   time-varying target that results when the asynchrony of the tracks is
   absorbed into the underlying target. Timing estimation for the tracks
   being detected is embedded inside the joint Viterbi detector using
   per-survivor processing. Performance results show that the proposed
   algorithm closely matches the performance of a fictitious system in
   which neighboring tracks are synchronous, and further that it
   significantly outperforms a previously reported detector that separately
   detects the two tracks.}},

   networks. Different from the conventional analysis, we derive the
   achievable sum-rate under the assumption that the number of the BS
   antennas is huge but limited. Based on the analytical results, we obtain
   the system EE and further analyze the effect of the number of BS
   antennas and scheduled users on system EE. The computer simulation

Abstract = {{The current IEEE 1609.4 standard defines multi-channel operations to
   alternate control and service channel intervals during a period of
   100ms. However, there is no mention of service channel selection for a
   service provider, which allows hidden service providers to select the
   same service channel. This limitation can cause the hidden terminal
   problem during the service channel intervals, leading to significant
   performance deterioration. Without modifying the existing standards, our
   proposed scheme enables hidden service providers to avoid selecting the
   same service channel by delivering their candidate service channel
   number in the optional field of the basic safety message (BSM). Through
   extensive simulations, it is verified that the packet reception ratio
   can be improved by up to 23\% in typical broadcast scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a complete data-aided (DA) synchronization
   algorithm for minimum-shift keying (MSK) transmission, which addresses
   features of the transmit-only Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). To provide
   reliable packet detection even under a packet overlapping scenario, our
   frame synchronization metric is based on a pseudo-random (PN) sequence
   preamble and keeps a constant low false alarm by dynamic thresholding
   based on real-time error floor level. The carrier frequency offset
   algorithm exploits the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Meanwhile, the
   preamble is also used as the training sequence for phase offset
   estimation based on a least-square (LS) estimator, to reduce the
   transmit energy. We simulate the packet detection rate, false alarm
   rate, and the root mean square (RMS) error of all synchronization
   parameters for the scenarios with and without packet overlapping. The
   computer simulation shows the robust performance of the synchronization
   process and reveals the great flexibility and trade-off control between
   complexity and performance by adjusting system design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Small cell base stations (SBSs) have been deployed in heterogeneous
   networks to improve the spectrum efficiency on licensed channels by
   reusing the spectrum resource of the macro base station (MBS). To relief
   the shortage on the licensed spectrum resources, licensed-assisted
   access (LAA) has been introduced to LTE small cell systems to share the
   unlicensed channel with the Wi-Fi users. In this paper, we investigate
   the fundamental tradeoff between the collision probability (CP) to the
   Wi-Fi users and the co-channel interference (CI) power to the MBS in
   such a heterogeneous LAA system. A multi-objective resource allocation
   problem is first formulated while guaranteeing the quality-of-service
   (QoS) of small cell users (SUEs). Then, the double waterfilling-line
   power allocation on the licensed and unlicensed channels is developed to
   analyze the CI-CP tradeoff and the weighted Tchebycheff method is
   applied to convert the multi-objective optimization problem into a
   single objective optimization problem. To find the complete set of
   Pareto optimal solutions to the tradeoff problem, a novel feasibility
   method is proposed. Based on the simulation results, the proposed joint
   resource allocation algorithm can achieve a flexible CI-CP tradeoff
   according to the QoS of SUEs in LAA systems.}},

   state-dependent channel with causal state information at the encoder

   coordination, which requires all sequences of symbols to be jointly

   perspective to simultaneously study state masking, state amplification,
   and capacity-distortion trade-off. Our main result is a characterization
   of the set of achievable rates, information leakages and joint
   distributions. We also discuss several specializations and extensions of
   the result, including the cases of zero message rate, without empirical
   coordination, strictly causal encoding, two-sided state information and
   noisy channel feedback. We introduce the notion of ``core of the
   decoder's knowledge,{''} to capture what the decoder can infer about all

Abstract = {{We consider a cognitive radio network where secondary users (SUs) are
   allowed access time to the spectrum belonging to the primary users (PUs)
   provided that they relay primary messages. PUs and SUs negotiate over
   allocations of the secondary power that will be used to relay PU data.
   We formulate the problem as a generalized assignment market to find an
   epsilon pairwise stable matching. We propose a distributed blind
   matching algorithm (BLMA) to produce the pairwise-stable matching plus
   the associated power allocations. We stipulate a limited information
   exchange in the network so that agents only calculate their own
   utilities but no information is available about the utilities of any
   other users in the network. We establish convergence to epsilon pairwise
   stable matchings in finite time. Finally we show that our algorithm
   exhibits a limited degradation in PU utility when compared with the
   Pareto optimal results attained using perfect information assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{Design synthesis is a fundamental engineering task that encompasses
   mapping a functional specification to a set of physical components and
   their topological relationships, where the mappings are typically
   non-unique. Even for moderately complex systems the consideration of all
   possible mappings is typically not feasible, making a manual exploration
   of the full design space impossible. In practice, this limitation often
   leads to sub-optimal designs. In this paper, we introduce a
   computational approach to design synthesis in conceptual design. Our
   approach is based around representing a design problem formally using
   SysML, and transforming this representation to a mixed-integer linear
   program. The generated mathematical optimization problem is then solved,
   and the mathematically optimal solution is transformed back to a
   SysML-based representation. We demonstrate our approach using the
   conceptual design of a robotic manufacturing cell as an example.}},

Abstract = {{In this note we prove three results concerning dual groups of subgroups
   of the Baer-Specker group. Firstly, we construct one of size 2(N0),
   which is not a dual group, and hence strongly non-reflexive. In
   contrast, due to Gobel and Pokutta, under Martin's axiom every subgroup
   strictly smaller than the continuum is actually a dual group. Secondly,
   we show that the latter is not a theorem of ZFC, as adding N-1 many
   Cohen reals to the ground model, we obtain a model of ZFC in which there
   is a non-dual subgroup of size N-1. However, the continuum may be large.
   Thirdly, we construct using Martin's axiom a subgroup whose nth dual is
   not an (n+1)st dual for any n. Together our results solve two questions
   from the book by Eklof and Mekler {[}2].}},

Abstract = {{Public infrastructure systems provide many of the services that are
   critical to the health, functioning, and security of society. Many of
   these infrastructures, however, lack continuous physical sensor
   monitoring to be able to detect failure events or damage that has
   occurred to these systems. We propose the use of social sensor big data
   to detect these events. We focus on two main infrastructure systems,
   transportation and energy, and use data from Twitter streams to detect
   damage to bridges, highways, gas lines, and power infrastructure.
   Through a three-step filtering approach and assignment to geographical
   cells, we are able to filter out noise in this data to produce relevant
   geolocated tweets identifying failure events. Applying the strategy to
   real-world data, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to utilize
   social sensor big data to detect damage and failure events in these
   critical public infrastructures.}},

   was batch micro-fabricated in silicon. The 40 mu m wide and 180 mu m
   deep isolation air trenches around the heater and a SiO2 passivation
   layer were used to provide thermal isolation. The testbed dissipates a
   power density of up to 4.75 kW/cm(2) using R134a refrigerant as the
   coolant. Thermal resistance and pumping power were compared between the
   micropin-fin device of interest and a reference `empty microgap' device
   to assess tradeoffs in performance. Micropin-fins were found to slightly
   reduce thermal resistance at the cost of a large increase in pumping
   power. In addition to experimental work, thermo-mechanical simulations

Abstract = {{With the continued miniaturization of microelectronics and increased
   power densities, thermal management of electronic devices is a major
   challenge. One of the main bottlenecks in thermal management is the
   thermal contact resistance at the interfaces of the various device
   components. Typically, Thermal Interface Materials (TIMs) have been used
   to reduce the thermal contact resistance. An ideal TIM would have low
   thermal resistance to improve thermal performance as well as good
   mechanical compliance to reduce thermally-induced stresses due to the
   CTE mismatch between silicon and heatspreader or heatsink.
   In this paper, we build on previous work using copper nanowires as
   electrical interconnects and show that copper nanowire arrays can be
   easily fabricated and used as high-performance TIMs. High mechanical
   compliance is achieved due to the high aspect ratio structure of the
   array. The thermal resistance of the arrays is measured using an ASTM
   D5470 apparatus, and it is seen that the nanowire arrays have the
   potential of having a thermal resistance as low as 0.2 mm(2)k/w.}},

Abstract = {{As the need for high performance and extreme power-dissipation
   microelectronic devices continues to rise, innovative thermal management
   solutions are being developed to efficiently remove the high heat fluxes
   dissipated in these applications. At heat flux rates surpassing the 1000
   W/cm(2) level in some localized hot spot cases, conductive spreading to
   an external heat sink is no longer a viable thermal management option.
   On-chip, enhanced microfluidic cooling with pin fins offers new
   opportunities to deliver coolant in close proximity to power dissipation
   zones and hot spots. In state-of-the-art designs a two-phase refrigerant
   is pumped through a microfluidic channel within an active device
   absorbing heat at high velocity. Hydrofoil-shaped, silicon micro-pin
   fins populate the flow space to increase surface area available for heat
   removal and for liquid films to coalesce. The proposed
   thermal-management system has been fabricated by etching the
   microchannel with hydrofoil pin fins into the backside of the silicon
   device and then bonding it to a capping layer. While the hydrofoil shape
   is designed to benefit thermal-fluid performance properties, reliability
   consideration must also be given to the geometry. Phase change of the
   liquid facilitates optimal heat removal rates but also requires
   high-pressure conditions for operation. At these high-pressure
   conditions, the pin fins will be subjected to stress due to fluid
   pressure. Because of the unique geometry of the hydrofoil pin fins,
   special consideration must be given to the interaction of stress
   concentrations due to fluidic pressure loading and the small radius of
   curvature of the hydrofoil tail. The objective of this paper is to
   examine the various sources of stress in this high-performance,
   micro-pin fin channel and explore the reliability of this hydrofoil pin
   fin design under high-pressure conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Flow boiling in surface-enhanced microgaps represents a promising
   thermal control method for the removal of relatively high heat fluxes in
   applications such as three-dimensional (3D) integration of
   microelectronics. Although a few experimental investigations have
   reported encouraging results for these types of cooling layers, the
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the involved physics has
   lagged behind due to a number of challenges. In the present study, a
   phase-change model is used with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method for
   interface tracking to analyze the transient flow regime evolution due to
   boiling in a microgap with circular pin fins for area enhancement, where
   the simultaneous heat conduction is solved in the silicon medium.
   High-Performance Computing (HPC) is used for investigating two-phase
   flow and heat transfer in a relatively dense array of pin fins of 150 mu
   m diameter populating a 175 mu m height microgap, which is 10 mm long.
   The dielectric refrigerant R245fa is used as the coolant due to its
   negligible electrical conductivity, desirable for inter-tier cooling.
   Results provide useful insight on how the vapor phase is generated and
   distributed as a function of the axial direction, as well as the
   implication on heat transfer and resulting surface temperatures to
   identify trends and required conditions for the reliable operation in
   potential microelectronic applications.}},

   pin height was 200 mu m. Mass fluxes of 624 kg/m(2)s and 1248 kg/m(2)s,
   heat fluxes ranged from 20 W/cm(2) to 300 W/cm(2), and inlet
   temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C were tested. All tests
   were conducted in a closed flow loop with pressure below atmospheric.

Abstract = {{Localized hot spots pose a major problem for data center thermal
   management. At present, most centers respond to hot spots by increasing
   the server fan speed to provide more cold air at the location of the hot
   spot. In an attempt to make sure that each server operates under
   temperature thresholds many servers are over-cooled. Thus, ensuring that
   cold air is available everywhere at all times requires over-provisioning
   the data center. Conversely, a lack of cold air causes recirculation of
   warm room air, making the hot spot worse. The desirable approach is
   instead to provide additional cold air only where and when required, and
   avoid overcooling the entire data center.
   Active tiles with integrated fans increase the local volume flowrate by
   redistributing the cold air supplied by the CRAC (computer room air
   conditioning) to the underfloor plenum. The objective of this work is to
   determine whether active tiles can be used to efficiently and
   economically eliminate hot spots in data centers. Experiments were
   conducted to determine air flow and temperature distributions, as a
   function of the CRAC unit blower and active tile fan speeds, for both a
   single tile/rack combination and a complete aisle populated with active
   tiles. The results were compared with those for passive (generic) tiles
   with similar effective porosity. Cross- correlation factors representing
   the effect of active tile on adjacent tiles are presented, and the power
   consumed by the active tiles in terms of W/m(3) air at the tile outlet
   is compared with that for passive tiles. The results indicate that the
   power consumption per unit air flow can be reduced by using a full aisle
   of active tiles.
   Based on the experimental observations, a control framework that uses
   the active tile fan speed as a process variable to provide the air
   flowrate required to cool the hot spot, while reducing power consumption
   by the server fan, and hence the energy consumed by the data center can
   be designed.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise of acceptable operating temperatures for information
   technology (IT) equipment, using ambient air has been a growing trend
   for data centers. In this computational study, a thermal wheel is used
   as a rotary air-to-air heat exchanger extracting heat from IT equipment
   and dissipating it to the ambient. The wheel is made of a metallic
   honeycomb material that enables air to pass through while convectively
   transferring heat. A computational model has been developed to calculate
   the volumetric air flow rate required for an assigned cooling load. When
   the ambient temperature is too high, direct expansion cooling is used as
   a secondary approach and modeled in building energy usage estimation
   software, EnergyPlus. The integrated computational model calculates
   overall power usage effectiveness (PUE) for data centers. Using weather
   data for a specific location, PUEs for several different climates can be
   obtained. Even without considering the energy savings that is produced
   through less air quality and humidity control, for a cooling load of 400
   kW, it was found that overall PUE can be as low as 1.10 in Helsinki,
   Finland and 1.20 in Atlanta, Georgia. The presented model can be used to
   determine the system performance with varying location, cooling load,
   and regenerative heat exchanger parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to fabricate AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
   (HEMTs) on Si substrates has enabled the production of low cost high
   power electronics. To further enhance the performance of GaN electronics
   for high power conversion, the ability to maintain high off-state
   breakdown voltages with large electron densities is necessary. The use
   of Si substrates, however, limits the device's capabilities due to its
   weak electrical field strength. This limitation has been identified as
   the main cause for breakdown in HEMTs when the high electric field
   reaches the silicon substrate underneath the region between the gate and
   drain. To overcome this obstacle, removal of the Si substrate between
   the gate and drain region has shown to increase the device's breakdown
   voltage up to 3000 V. While removing the Si substrate extends the
   capabilities of GaN HEMTs for high voltage applications, the effects of
   the Si removal on the thermal performance during operation has not yet
   been investigated. Raman Thermometry, a well-developed technique, is
   used to compare the maximum temperature rise between a Local Substrate
   Removed (LSR) device and a non-LSR device. The application of
   nanoparticles (TiO2 and ZnO) for measuring surface temperatures via
   Raman spectroscopy is also investigated and applied to determine a more
   accurate temperature of the gate junction temperature. The LSR device
   was found to have a much higher thermal resistance than its non-LSR
   device counterpart limiting the maximum power dissipation the LSR device
   can achieve before severe degradation. Volumetric averaged residual
   stress mapping was also measured via Raman Spectroscopy and suggests the
   removal of the Si relaxes the stress in the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN
   barrier which can be exploited in designs to improve reliability.
   Methods to improve the thermal reliability of LSR devices are key to
   implementing such devices as future power switches.}},

Abstract = {{Optimized thermal management remains a growing challenge for electronics
   packaging as increased heat fluxes must be dissipated through multiple
   material interfaces and as demand for smaller, flexible, and low-cost
   packages persists. Polymers are light weight and offer mechanical
   properties that make them favorable for thermal interface applications,
   but suffer from extremely low thermal conductivity. Here we melt polymer
   films into nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates to fabricate
   large area arrays of vertically aligned polymer nanofibers. Nanoscale
   confinement and flow induced alignment effects improve polymer chain
   alignment and thermal conductivity along the fiber's long axis.
   Conjugated poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and non-conjugated
   polyethylene (PE) of various molecular weights are explored to establish
   a relationship between polymer structure, nanofiber diameter, and the
   resulting thermal conductivity. In general, thermal conductivity
   improves with decreasing fiber diameter and increasing polymer molecular
   weight. Thermal conductivities approaching 10 W/m-K were achieved for
   both the 200 nm diameter PE fibers and the 100 nm diameter P3HT fibers.
   These results pave the way for optimization of the processing conditions
   to produce high thermal conductivity fibers using different polymers,

Abstract = {{Performance of the next generation microprocessors is rapidly reaching
   its limits due to inability to remove heat, especially at high power
   density from so-called local ``hotspots{''}. Convective boiling heat
   transfer in microgap heat sinks has the potential to dissipate
   ultra-high heat fluxes. We report results of an experimental
   investigation of heat transfer performance of three dedicated microgap
   coolers for hotspot thermal management. In this study, a rectangular
   microgap, batch micromachined in silicon and instrumented with thin-film
   resistive thermometry, is employed to assess its capability of
   dissipating extreme heat fluxes of multiple kW/cm(2) while keeping the
   wall temperature within the limits dictated by electronics reliability.
   Convective boiling in microgap with heights of 5 mu m and 10 mu m was
   tested with and without pin fins in the microgap. The test section was
   heated from the bottom using resistive heaters and capped with glass to
   enable visual observation of two-phase flow regimes. Microgap pressure
   drop and wall temperature measurements, mapped into flow regimes, were
   obtained with R134a as the coolant, for heat fluxes up to 5 kW/cm(2),
   mass fluxes up to 7,000 kg/m(2)s, at maximum pressures up to 1.5 MPa and
   outlet vapor qualities approaching unity. These experimental parameters
   constitute extreme values in terms of microgap height (smallest reported
   to our knowledge), mass fluxes, and heat fluxes. New flow regimes,
   including vapor plumes, liquid slugs, and ultra-thin wavy liquid film,
   were observed as a function of increasing heat flux and microgap
   geometry. Dominant mechanism(s) of two-phase heat transfer responsible
   for each regime have been postulated based on flow visualization
   correlated with pressure drop and thermal resistance measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management and planning is important for heterogeneous
   integration due to the introduction of a complex thermal path. Thermal
   measurement of operating devices provides necessary data points for
   future design as well as validation of models. In this paper, two
   methods for measuring thermal performance of DAHI (Diverse Accessible
   Heterogeneous Integration) GaN HEMTs are presented and contrasted: IR
   microscopy and micro Raman spectroscopy. The QFI IR system uses a
   per-pixel material emissivity flat temperature calibration when the
   device is in an off-state, and then calculates operating temperatures by
   CCD exposure. Two separate QFI systems with differing CCD resolutions
   were used to collect thermal data and are compared. Raman Thermometry by
   contrast, is a laser point measurement of the frequency shift in
   scattered photons due to phonon vibrational modes whose frequencies are
   temperature dependent. Differences in measurements between the two
   methods arising from the stack of materials used in the DAHI process and
   their transparency are discussed. A method for measuring the surface
   temperature of the devices through Raman by the use of TiO2
   nanoparticles is also presented in conjunction with a profile of the
   HEMT. Measurements are presented alongside thermal simulation results
   using prototype software Mentor Graphics (TM) Calibre (R)}},

Abstract = {{When a robot is deployed to a new setting, it must reason about how to
   accomplish the goals of domain-appropriate tasks within the environment
   it is situated. We investigate the problem of enabling robots to
   interactively learn how to perform known tasks in new environments. Each
   task is composed of a sequence of parameterized actions, which we assume
   are given to the robot in the form of a task recipe. In order to learn
   how to ground the task in a new environment, our learner builds
   classifiers to model each of the parameters (i.e. all unique objects and
   semantic locations) associated with the task. In evaluation for two
   tasks across three different environments, our results show that these
   groundings are both (1) capable of being learned efficiently from
   demonstrations, and (2) necessary to learn for each new environment.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that external corrective feedback provided
   to individuals undergoing physical therapy sessions increases the
   efficacy of their intervention protocols, thus allowing for the
   individual to rapidly improve on their performance. However, direct
   feedback is typically provided by an expert therapist during weekly or
   monthly visits, which limits improvement on a daily basis. As such, we
   promote in-home rehabilitation protocols by developing a novel framework
   that couples serious games with a robotic playmate. After showing in a
   previous study that a combination of verbal and nonverbal cues is the
   most efficient method for providing guided instruction, we now show that
   the efficacy of the intervention protocols can be further increased by
   embedding human-like behaviors on the robotic platform such that it
   provides continuous feedback. This would allow user performance to
   improve at each iteration of feedback and, ultimately, reach an
   individualized performance goal. To show that users can reach a
   reference point for a given kinematic parameter, we recruited adults and
   children to interact with our system. Results from the first round of
   experiments show that adults who received feedback from an embodied
   agent need less trials on average to reach their performance goals than
   the adults who received feedback from a virtual agent. Results from the
   second round of experiments further support our hypothesis by showing
   that children also reach their performance goals by receiving feedback
   from the robotic playmate. We conclude that coupling existing serious
   games with an embodied robotic agent has the potential of increasing the
   efficacy of intervention protocols by allowing for use outside the
   clinical setting thus increasing users' rate of improvement.}},

   performed an evaluation comparing participants' understanding of robotic

Abstract = {{Innovative air traffic concepts of operation are now possible that
   enable novel allocations of authority and responsibility between air and
   ground, and between humans and automation. This paper proposes a
   systematic approach for the synthesis of allocations of authority and
   responsibility early in the design of a concept of operations to achieve
   its performance and safety goals. The methodology models the concept of
   operations as a network of actions to treat the synthesis of authority
   allocation as a network optimization problem. A case study involving
   merging and spacing operations is provided in which allocations of
   authority are created to minimize information transfer between agents
   under varying responsibility allocations and varying requirements for
   balancing taskload across agents. The results demonstrate how
   significantly metrics such as information transfer between agents, and
   their taskload, can vary with different allocations and, thus, how the
   methodology proposed here can quickly help identify appropriate
   allocations of authority and responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) aims at structuring traffic in order
   to reduce congestion in airspace. Congestion being linked to aircraft
   located at the same position at the same time, ATFM organizes traffic in
   the spatial dimension (e.g. route network) and/or in the time dimension
   (sequencing and merging in TMA, Miles-in-Trail for en-route airspace).
   The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology that allows the
   traffic to self-organize in the time dimension when demand is high. This
   structure disappears when the demand diminishes.
   In order to reach this goal, a multi-agent system has been developed. In
   this system, aircraft agents regulate speed and delay departure time in
   order to reduce the number of conflicts, thus decreases overall traffic
   complexity, which becomes easier to manage by air traffic controllers.
   This algorithm was applied on realistic examples.}},

Abstract = {{In a context of steady growth of Air Traffic world wide, Air Navigation
   Service must meet growing demand and report on the quality of their
   performance. This paper presents the design and evaluation of novel
   performance metrics aimed at evaluating Air Traffic Management Systems.
   After providing a general overview of the existing performance metrics,
   the following new performance metrics are introduced: the number of
   occurrences the flight plan falls outside the set of preferred routes,
   the difference in length and duration between an airline flight plan and
   wind optimal routes. The evaluation is predicated on the necessity for
   the metrics to be robust, easy to compute and applicable to several
   different Air Traffic Management Systems, eg. Europe vs USA.}},

Abstract = {{As air traffic grows, improving the resilience of an increasingly
   congested airspace is becoming a primary concern to ensure its
   sustainability and avoid the propagation of localized disruptions. The
   fire set at Chicago Air Traffic Control facility in September 2014 is a
   striking and worrisome case where one ill-intentioned individual halted
   traffic in a facility which caused ripple effects across the National
   Airspace. This paper analyzes the particular role that the Chicago
   center plays in the National airspace. Then it provides a detailed
   analysis of the local and global impact of the fire, through the day of
   the event and for the next two weeks while the facility remained closed
   for repairs. Finally, it draws the lessons learnt from this event as
   well as other recent infrastructure failures.}},

Abstract = {{We tackle the problem of joint discovery and segmentation of the object
   of interest from noisy image sets collected via web crawling (e.g.,
   Figure 1). Existing methods {[}1] {[}2] {[}3] employ region-wise
   comparison in order to separate noise images (images not containing
   target objects) from the rest, which may be a bottleneck for scaling up
   to larger datasets. Our idea to avoid such computationally intensive
   operations is to use image-wise reconstruction errors. Specifically,
   based on the assumption that images containing target objects are easier
   to be reconstructed by a pool of target objects than noise images, we
   first reconstruct each image using a small number of similar target
   objects. The resulting error is then combined with some other criteria
   (e.g., saliency) so as to delineate only target object regions.
   Experimental evaluations on a noisy image dataset {[}1] demonstrate that
   our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on every subset of the
   dataset 5 - 7 times faster than existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Identification and tracking of red blood cells and leukocytes in
   micro-circulation is very important for drug validation and
   inflammation. Manual tracking is usually used for this purpose. However,
   due to its excessive time consumption and inaccuracy in the case of
   overlapped cells, there is a need for automated methods. In this paper,
   we propose a Kalman filter and active-disc-based method for automatic
   and accurate detection of cells. In addition to tracking both slow and
   fast moving blood cells, the proposed method is also able to track
   overlapped cells successfully with an overall tracking accuracy of
   95.7\% and at a processing rate of 25 ms per frame. Comparisons with
   five state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method is better in
   terms of the detection rate and accuracy of instantaneous speed
   estimation.}},

   encodes the directional variation of the local differences of two scales
   as a complementary component to local patterns in CLBP. The new
   component in CLDP, with regarded as the directional derivative pattern,
   reflects the directional smoothness of local textures without increasing
   computation complexity. Experimental results on the Outex database show
   that CLDP, as a uni-scale pattern, outperforms uni-scale
   state-of-the-art texture descriptors on texture classification and has

Abstract = {{Localizing seismic structures that can form traps for hydrocarbon
   reservoirs within large seismic volumes is a very challenging task. Due
   to the lack of accurately labeled data, we propose a weakly-supervised
   model for labeling seismic volumes using only a few labeled exemplars.
   Using six manually-labeled patches, we are able to extract patches that
   contain instances of similar geophysical structures. Features based on
   the effective singular values of curvelet coefficients are then used to
   train a classifier that can label an entire seismic volume with
   relatively high accuracy. Experiments on reference seismic sections in
   the Netherlands North Sea seismic dataset result in 73.8\% mean pixel
   accuracy and 75.5\% mean class accuracy, with an average labeling time
   of 5.2 seconds per section. These results are promising considering the
   nature of seismic images, and the lack of accurate edges between
   different geological structures.}},

Abstract = {{An important problem that arises in the analysis of many complex
   networks is to identify the common pathways that enable the flow of
   information (or other quantities) through the network. This is a
   particularly challenging problem when the only information observed
   consists of the timing of events in the network. We develop a framework
   based on multidimensional Hawkes processes that can be used to determine
   how events are related. This extends the capability of Hawkes
   process-based models to infer how network events relate. We then show
   how a simple dynamic program can exploit this data to recognize chains
   of events and provide a much deeper insight into the behavior of nodes
   within the network. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the
   capabilities and limitations of this framework.}},

Abstract = {{Wurtzite structured materials such as InN, CaN, ZnO, and CdSe
   simultaneously possess piezoelectric, semiconducting, and
   photoexcitation properties. The piezo-phototronic effect utilizes the
   piezo-polarization charges induced in the vicinity of the
   interface/junction to regulate the energy band diagrams and modulate
   charge carriers in the optoelectronic processes, such as transport,
   generation, recombination, and separation. This article reviews recent
   progress in piezo-phototronic effect enhanced photodetectors, starting
   from the fundamental physics, following the development from a single
   nanowire device to a large-scale photodetector array for illumination
   imaging. The piezo-phototronic effect provides a promising approach to
   improve the performance of the wurtzite structured material-based
   photodetectors. It may have potential applications in optical
   communication, optoelectronic devices, and multifunctional computing
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient condition assessment of road networks is crucial to
   prevent pavement distresses which can cause a spectrum of detrimental
   effects. The need for automation of the underlying process is originated
   from the costly, time-consuming and dangerous current methods. Presented
   herein is the automation of the patch detection process, which is
   essential for pavement surface evaluation and rating. The method is
   based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification. The road pavement
   images are divided into square blocks and the SVM is trained and tested
   by feature vectors generated from these blocks. The feature vectors
   consist of the histogram and two texture descriptors, using the discrete
   cosine transform (DCT) and the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
   The output is a binary image, where each image block is classified as
   ``patch{''} or ``no-patch{''}. The performance of the proposed MatlabTM
   implementation, which uses data collected from real-life urban networks,
   is rated by a detection accuracy of 81.97 \%, a precision of 64.21 \%,
   and a recall of 91.21 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral partitioning (clustering) algorithms use eigenvectors to solve
   network analysis problems. The relationship between numerical accuracy
   and network mining quality is insufficiently understood. We show that
   analyzing numerical accuracy and network mining quality together leads
   to an algorithmic improvement. Specifically, we study spectral
   partitioning using sweep cuts of approximate eigenvectors of the
   normalized graph Laplacian. We introduce a novel, theoretically sound,
   parameter free stopping criterion for iterative eigensolvers designed
   for graph partitioning. On a corpus of social networks, we validate this
   stopping criterion by showing the number of iterations is reduced by a
   factor of 4 : 1 5 on average, and the conductance is increased by only a
   factor of 1 : 2 4 on average. Regression analysis of these results shows
   that the decrease in the number of iterations needed is greater for
   problems with a small spectral gap, thus our stopping criterion helps
   more on harder problems. Experiments show that alternative stopping
   criteria are insufficient to ensure low conductance partitioning on real
   world networks. While our method guarantees partitions that satisfy the
   Cheeger Inequality, we find that it typically beats this guarantee on
   real world graphs.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a new local, vertex-level measure of community
   change. Our measure detects vertices that change community membership
   due to the actions (edges) of a vertex itself and not only due to global
   community shifts. The local nature of our measure is important for
   analyzing real graphs because communities may change to a large degree
   from one snapshot in time to the next. Using both real and synthetic
   graphs, we compare our measure to an alternative, global approach. Both
   approaches detect community switching vertices in a synthetic example
   with little overall community change. However, when communities do not
   evolve smoothly over time, the global approach flags a very large number
   of vertices, while our local method does not.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic graphs are used to represent changing relational data. In order
   to create a dynamic graph representing relationships or interactions
   over time, it is necessary to choose a method of adding new data and
   removing, or otherwise deemphasizing, past data to decrease its
   influence. In particular, the question of aging edges is new to dynamic
   graphs and has not been thoroughly studied. In this work, we address the
   problem of aging vertices and edges to create a dynamic graph from a
   stream of temporal data. We provide two new methods, active vertex and
   active edge, and also evaluate two methods from the literature, sliding
   window and weight decay. By analyzing various properties of the dynamic
   graphs created by each aging method, we provide practitioners with
   quantitative comparisons. We find several interesting similarities and
   differences. The active vertex and weight decay methods reduce the
   variability over time of several vertex level measures compared to
   sliding window and active edge. This means that in practice, active
   vertex or weight decay may be more useful if graph stability is
   preferred, while sliding window or active edge may be preferred if the
   graph should be sensitive to changes in the underlying data stream. Each
   method also differently affects global measures. The most connected
   graph is produced by active vertex, while the most disconnected by
   weight decay. We observe that despite the differences, the graphs
   produced by each method experience similar types of changes at similar
   points in time.}},

Abstract = {{The Large Observatory For x-ray Timing (LOFT) is a mission concept which
   was proposed to ESA as M3 and M4 candidate in the framework of the
   Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 program. Thanks to the unprecedented combination
   of effective area and spectral resolution of its main instrument and the
   uniquely large field of view of its wide field monitor, LOFT will be
   able to study the behaviour of matter in extreme conditions such as the
   strong gravitational field in the innermost regions close to black holes
   and neutron stars and the supra-nuclear densities in the interiors of
   neutron stars. The science payload is based on a Large Area Detector
   (LAD, > 8m(2) effective area, 2-30 keV, 240 eV spectral resolution, 1
   degree collimated field of view) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM, 2-50
   keV, 4 steradian field of view, 1 arcmin source location accuracy, 300
   eV spectral resolution). The WFM is equipped with an on-board system for
   bright events (e. g., GRB) localization. The trigger time and position
   of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30 s from discovery.
   In this paper we present the current technical and programmatic status
   of the mission.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, graphene/polyurethane composites with characteristic of
   covalently bonding and Diels-Alder (DA) chemistry was developed.
   Thereinto, graphene was functionalized as filler to enhance mechanical
   properties and further used as medium for absorbing the power of
   infrared (IR) laser and transferring it to heat for repairing the
   composites based on the reversible DA chemistry. Besides, the
   monodisperse graphene was used as high dielectric material to improve
   the dielectric properties of the composites. Therefore, the as-prepared
   graphene/polyurethane composites possess excellent mechanical
   properties, good dielectric properties and super repairing ability by
   means of IR laser. All the results indicated that the novel
   graphene/polyurethane could be considered as the candidate for
   intelligent components and the areas of encapsulated electronic
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible electronics has emerged as an independent field and matured
   over the past decades due to they can provide a lot of benefits as
   compared with traditional rigid printed circuit boards, such as better
   durability, lighter weight, higher space efficiency, and improved
   comfort. Graphene-based electronics provide new opportunities for
   flexible electronics because of their superior properties including high
   electrical conductivity, high mechanical flexibility, high carrier
   mobility, and so forth. In this work, a water-dispersible graphene paste
   (WGP) was used as raw materials to fabricate flexible conductive
   patterns and films on various substrates. The water dispersions have
   noteworthy advantages over those obtained in organic solvents, such as
   low cost, absence of solvent toxicity and capacity for green chemistry
   compatibility with hydrophilic substrates, also avoiding post reduction
   of graphene oxide (GO) to obtain electrical conductivity. The
   microstructures and rheological properties of the WGP were firstly
   studied. Then, the WGP with a high concentration of 20 mg mL-1 was
   directly printed on flexible substrates such as paper and PET film by a
   simple and low-cost stencil printing method to obtain various printed
   patterns. The electrical properties and durability of the printed
   patterns were investigated under different deformations such as bending
   and folding. The printed conductive patterns show a good conductivity
   and which can be visually demonstrated by lighting a LED bulb with a 3 V
   power source. The WGP conductive line on paper exhibits excellent
   electrical stability (-5\% of relative change of resistance) after 1500
   bending cycles. Moreover, after dilution of the WGP to a low
   concentration of 2 mg mL-1, it can be used to fabricate a flexible
   conductive film on PET substrate by spray coating technology, and which
   shows a low sheet resistance of-44.33.11, scil at a thickness of 5 um.
   The results reveal that the WGP possess outstanding electronic
   properties and have great potential for the convenient fabrication of
   flexible and low-cost graphene based electronics on various substrates
   including flexible paper and plastics, by using a simple stencil
   printing method or spray printing technology.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile and highly-effective method to synthesize W-RGO
   (water dispersible reduced graphene oxide), and fabricate a textile
   cloth based flexible electrode using the obtained W-RGO as ink materials
   via the simple dipping and coating method. FTIR (Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and Raman
   spectroscopy were used to analyze the morphology and structure of the
   W-RGO samples. The results showed that the GO (graphene oxide) sheets
   had been successfully modified and reduced with ABS (3-Aminobenzene
   sulfonic acid) and Ascorbic Acid. In addition, the CV (cyclic
   voltammetry) was used to investigate the electrochemical performance
   with a two-electrode cell measurement, and the electrochemical data
   exhibited that the electrode displayed high areal capacitance of 70 mF
   cm-2 at the current density of 5 mA cm-2, and retained 94.3 \% of the
   initial capacitance after 2000 cycles, which provide another new ways to
   fabricate the flexible and wearable energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Heat generated by electronic devices and circuitry must be dissipated to
   improve their performance, reliability and prevent the premature
   failure. One of important methods is to fabricate composites with high
   thermal conductivity. In this study, we develop a novel approach for
   surface modification of boron nitride nanosheets and silicon nanowires
   by being decorated with silver nanoparticles. The resultant composite
   paper possesses a high through-plane thermal conductivity up to 1.80 W
   m(-1) K-1. This attributes to the fact that the silver nanoparticles
   efficiently links the assembled boron nitride nanosheets and silicon
   carbide nanowires, which results in formation of more thermally
   conductive pathways. This work offers a new insight into the strategies
   for the enhancement of thermal conductivity of polymer-based composites,
   for the widely identified and pursued potential applications in modern
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Through silicon via (TSV) is an enabling technology for 3D
   interconnection. The insulation layer at the bottom of the via usually
   needs to be removed in order to expose the pad so that the electrical
   interconnection from the front side to the back side can be realized.
   This removal may be implemented by plasma etching, laser drilling, or
   photolithography. Compared with the other two methods, photolithography
   is considered having the merits of high efficiency, high reliability and
   low cost. In this study, we developed a photosensitive polymer
   insulation material that can be deposited with the spin-coating process.
   The photosensitive material at the bottom of the TSV was developed with
   potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution after exposure to thr 365 nm UV
   light. At last, the residual photosensitive polymer was cured via a
   preset heating procedure. The resulting polymer insulation layer
   exhibited excellent thermal stability, good chemical resistance, good
   adhesion and good thickness uniformity. Such a material may be
   considered a promising candidate for the insulation layer for the
   applications of CMOS image sensor (CIS) and fingerprint identification
   sensor with TSVs having a low aspect ratio.}},

   V vertical bar log vertical bar V vertical bar ). We then show how to
   delay expensive intermediate computations until we know that new
   information will be required, hence saving time by not operating on
   information that is never used during the search. Finally, we present a
   way to remove the very expensive need to calculate a full multi- scale
   map with the use of sampling and derive an upper bound on the
   probability of failure as a function of the number of samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to learn visual
   features online for improving loop-closure detection and place
   recognition, based on bag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a
   codeword in the bag-of-words model from a pair of matched features from
   two consecutive frames, such that the codeword has temporally-derived
   perspective invariance to camera motion. The learning algorithm is
   efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the mean image patch,
   and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by minimizing
   the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two original
   features. A codeword is generated by packaging the learned descriptor
   and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to measure the distance
   between two codewords. The geometric properties of the learned codewords
   are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis constraints
   are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords, which
   improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental
   bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and
   compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved
   precision/recall outperforming state of the art with little loss in

Abstract = {{Pneumatic actuation has gained popularity in robotics, for its low
   maintenance, high efficiency and compactness. A recent direction is to
   build pneumatically driven non-magnetic platforms for robotic
   rehabilitation monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Control of
   such systems is challenging as they involve long transmission lines to
   satisfy MR-compatibility requirements and direct pressure measurement at
   the actuator is not available. This paper presents a control algorithm
   that provides an accurate impedance control for pneumatic systems with
   long transmission lines. The algorithm involves a pressure observer
   based on force and displacement feedback to compensate for the lack of
   pressure measurement. The observed pressures are utilized in a robust
   controller for force tracking. The described method is tested on a
   system with 7 meters long transmission lines. Impedance control using
   the presented observer achieved stable force tracking up to 1.5 Hz,
   lowering mean squared error by up to \%25.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for
   dynamic and underactuated bipedal walking, but has significant
   implementation difficulties when applied to the high degrees of freedom
   present in humanoid robots. The primary impediment is the process of
   gait design-it is difficult for optimizers to converge on a viable set
   of virtual constraints defining a gait. This paper presents a
   methodology that allows for the fast and reliable generation of
   efficient multi-contact robotic walking gaits through the framework of
   HZD, even in the presence of underactuation. To achieve this goal, we
   unify methods from trajectory optimization with the control framework of
   multi-domain hybrid zero dynamics. By formulating a novel optimization
   problem in the context of direct collocation and generating analytic
   Jacobians for the constraints, solving the resulting nonlinear program
   becomes tractable for large-scale nonlinear programming solvers, even
   for systems as high-dimensional as humanoid robots. We experimentally
   validated our methodology on the spring-legged prototype humanoid,
   DURUS, showing that the optimization approach yields dynamic and stable
   3D walking gaits.}},

Abstract = {{Humanoid robots are designed with dozens of actuated joints to suit a
   variety of tasks, but walking controllers rarely make the best use of
   all of this freedom. We present a framework for maximizing the use of
   the full humanoid body for the purpose of stable dynamic locomotion,
   which requires no restriction to a planning template (e.g. LIPM). Using
   a hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, this approach optimizes a set of
   outputs which provides requirements for the motion for all actuated
   links, including arms. These output equations are then rapidly solved by
   a whole-body inverse-kinematic (IK) solver, providing a set of joint
   trajectories to the robot. We apply this procedure to a simulation of
   the humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO, which has over 27 actuators. As a
   consequence, the resulting gaits swing their arms, not by a user
   defining swinging motions a priori or superimposing them on gaits post
   hoc, but as an emergent behavior from optimizing the dynamic gait. We
   also present preliminary dynamic walking experiments with DRCHUBO in
   hardware, thereby building a case that hybrid zero dynamics as augmented
   by inverse kinematics (HZD+ IK) is becoming a viable approach for
   controlling the full complexity of humanoid locomotion.}},

   the leg morphology. Utilizing the final design of DURUS, a formal
   framework for the generation of dynamic walking gaits which maximizes
   efficiency by exploiting the full body dynamics of the robot, including
   the interplay between the passive and active elements, is developed. The
   gaits generated through this methodology form the basis of the control
   implementation experimentally realized on DURUS; in particular, the
   trajectories generated through the formal framework yield a feed-forward
   control input which is modulated by feedback in the form of regulators
   that compensate for discrepancies between the model and physical system.
   The end result of the unified approach to control-informed mechanical
   design, formal gait design and regulator-based feedback control
   implementation is efficient and dynamic locomotion on the humanoid robot
   DURUS. In particular, DURUS was able to demonstrate dynamic locomotion
   at the DRC Finals Endurance Test, walking for just under five hours in a
   single day, traveling 3.9 km with a mean cost of transport of 1.61-the
   lowest reported cost of transport achieved on a bipedal humanoid robot.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical similarity measurements, such as mutual information (MI) and
   normalized mutual information (NMI), show potential in the registration
   of 2D-image to 3D-range scans collected in urban environments. However
   2D-3D registration with these measurements are of limited usage in urban
   sensing applications because: 1) it relies on the diversity and
   dependency between pre-defined pair of 2D-3D attributes, such as the
   intensity from images and reflectivity from range scans, in the urban
   sensing environment, and 2) it requires high-end range sensors with
   strong abilities to capture reflectivity in urban scenarios. In this
   paper, we propose a robust way of estimating statistical similarity
   measurements for 2D-3D data that are collected in various urban scenes
   with both low-cost and high-end range sensors. Rather than estimate the
   similarity of 2D-3D data on specific pair of 2D3D attributes, we compute
   similarity measurements between a set of 2D-3D attribute-pairs that
   could be dominant in the category of sensed urban scene and combine them
   into a reliable similarity measurement. By applying the combined
   similarity measurement to the common framework of statistical 2D-3D
   registration, we get superior results when compared with state-of-art
   similarity measurements (MI and NMI) in terms of registration accuracy
   and robustness to initial condition, as indicated by experiments
   conducted on two datasets that are collected in various urban scenes,
   with low-cost and high-end sensors.}},

   affordances. Although affordances are a commonly used high-level
   paradigm for robotic task-level planning and learning, the literature
   has been sparse regarding how to characterize the agent in this
   object-agent-environment framework. In this work, we propose decomposing
   a behavior into a vocabulary of characteristic requirements and
   capabilities that are suitable to predict the affordances of various
   parts of the workspace. Specifically, we investigate mechanical wrenches
   as a viable representation of these affordance requirements and
   capabilities. We then use this vocabulary in a planning system to
   compose complex motions from simple behavior types in continuous space.
   The utility of the framework for complex planning is demonstrated on
   example scenarios both in simulation and with real-world industrial
   manipulators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to generate discrete switching commands for
   a camera orientation system exhibiting quantization and flexibility to
   achieve smooth-pursuit like movements. Existing vibration suppression
   techniques and camera positioning devices have shown notable results but
   focused only on point-to-point movements. A desired motion profile can
   be generated by incorporating a classical feedback controller with PWM
   quantization but each unit actuator is required to produce
   high-frequency switching that can potentially damage the complaint
   mechanism. The proposed controller generates pulse-like switching
   commands for smooth-pursuit like motion to match the velocity of an
   object of interest. Then, switching commands for vibration suppression
   are generated to avoid high-frequency switching. The proposed method has
   been evaluated by using a robotic system which has a total of 32
   piezoelectric actuator. The experiment results show that the camera
   orientation system successfully achieved dynamic vision given the
   proposed commands in an open-loop manner.}},

Abstract = {{The drain current of a transistor in subthreshold operation exhibits a
   temperature dependence due to the thermal voltage, kT/q. The magnitude
   of this temperature dependence, as measured in 1979, was reported to be
   greater than the expected kT/q due to increased interface state
   densities; however, thirty years later, we saw little dependence. This
   behavior is of interest because subthreshold-enabled asynchronous
   circuits allow for operation below threshold with optimal power
   performance at threshold, but the original work suggests that static
   current will increase with temperature at a rate greater than predicted
   by the thermal voltage alone. Furthermore, the previously recorded
   behavior was very similar to what would be expected from ESD diodes. We
   revisit the work by Card et al., and present data from a commercially
   available 350nm process over temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In this effort, the authors improve upon most of the limitations of
   state-of-the-art chipless sensing technologies, by introducing a novel,
   and demonstrably robust, platform and reading scheme for long-range,
   wireless sensing. This platform was built upon a fully-inkjet printed
   and flexible 30 GHz square patch antenna Van-Atta reflect-array, which
   provides high RCS over a broad range of interrogation angles, with only
   a 10 dB decrease in RCS at +/- 70 degrees from boresight. Furthermore,
   the signal reflected by the structure is cross-polarized with respect to
   that of the impinging wave, providing high polarimetric detectability.
   For this first application, the device was fully inkjet-printed on a
   polyimide (Kapton) substrate, whose humidity-dependent permittivity was
   taken advantage of, associated with an appropriate high performance
   signal processing scheme, in order to provide the first long-range
   capable, fully-printed chipless flexible sensor to date.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design scheme of a fully integrated folded
   inductor based mm-wave rat-race coupler within only one inductor
   footprint. The detailed circuit analysis and design equations are
   presented. A proof-of-concept design example at 70 GHz is implemented in
   a 130nm CMOS process. Compared with other reported rat-race couplers at
   60-70GHz, the proposed design achieves a more than 3x size reduction and
   occupies a core chip area of only 0.037mm(2) . Based on the
   measurements, the proposed rat-race coupler design achieves an insertion
   loss of 4.1dB, i.e., an additional passive loss of 1.1dB at 70GHz, and
   the return loss is better than 15dB with 22GHz bandwidth (31.4\%). The
   phase difference is within 180 degrees +/- 5 degrees from 62GHz to
   78GHz, and the amplitude mismatch is within 1dB from 67GHz to 81GHz. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a folded

Abstract = {{This work proposes an asymmetric SPDT transmit/receive (T/R) switch
   co-optimized with a low-noise amplifier (LNA) tailored to X-band
   operation and implemented in an 0.13 mu m silicon-germanium (SiGe)
   BiCMOS technology. The switch achieves very high power handling
   capability in transmit mode, while maintaining low insertion loss, by
   utilizing an asymmetric topology. In receive mode, low noise is obtained
   by integrating a lumped-element matching network used simultaneously as
   a noise matching network for the LNA, as well as a lumped lambda/4
   transformer for the SPDT switch isolation. In transmit mode, the
   SPDT-LNA results in 1.1 dB minimum insertion loss, 26 dB isolation, and
   26.9 dBm output P1dB at 10 GHz. In receive mode, the measured minimum
   noise figure (NF) is 1.9 dB with 15 dB gain at 10 GHz. To the authors'
   best knowledge, these results are the lowest NF and highest transmit
   output P1dB for any Si-based SPDT-LNA currently reported at X-band, and

Abstract = {{Backscatter radio is being increasingly used for identification,
   sensing, and localization. The increased number of pervasive IoT systems
   that utilize backscatter radio as a low-power and low-cost communication
   scheme has led to dense deployments of tags that need to operate under
   bandwidth constraints. However, typical backscatter radio modulators
   perform switching ``on-off{''} operation and modulate data with
   rectangular pulses, which are known to occupy an extensively wide
   bandwidth. This work derives new techniques and demonstrates front-ends
   that control the tag reflection coefficient over time in a continuous
   manner, thus enabling the generation of arbitrary backscattered
   waveforms and reduced bandwidth occupancy. The principles presented
   hereby will enable sophisticated tags to perform more complex modulation
   schemes, while maintaining the RF front-end complexity at low levels,
   using a single PIN diode or FET.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the feasibility of a system for the detection of
   multi-modal RFID sensing is presented. A reader is designed for
   detecting multiple resonances of frequency-shifting RFID sensors, each

   exploits information of the actual return loss between the tag antenna
   and the RFID IC, rather than the tag power-on threshold that has been
   typically used in the prior art, overcoming limitations associated with
   the power-on threshold function. The estimator for extracting the return
   loss of a tag wirelesslyis derived and experimentally tested with a
   low-cost software-defined radio platform. The developed platform can
   serve both the purposes of a tag performance testing reader and a
   central processing station for next-generation multi-sensor RFID tags.}},

Abstract = {{Speed and quality of construction have always been a driving factor in
   the construction industry. In today's era of technically complex
   projects, a variety of concepts and delivery methods have been defined
   all striving to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for faster project
   delivery from concept to completion. For reasons ranging from emergency
   rebuilds to conditions related to competitive market forces to
   regulatory compliance considerations, a higher level of fast tracking is
   needed offering greater predictability and even faster project
   deliveries. Hence, the pursuit of ``Faster Fast Track{''} or ``Flash
   Track{''} deems necessary. This research defines Flash Track as a
   time-driven project, which by necessity requires a heightened degree of
   concurrency between engineering, procurement and construction. A
   principle research question was to identify and prioritize practices and
   strategies that could be employed to compress project durations, while
   maintaining safety, quality, and risk tolerance. This paper reports on
   the results of structured interviews, which were conducted on three
   successful Flash Track efforts, including an emergency rebuild project,
   a contractual integrated project delivery (IPD), and a major industrial
   project that embraced Lean Construction practices. Content analysis from
   these interviews yielded fourteen Flash Track practices, which were
   subsequently vetted by sixty-four fast track experts in a 3-round Delphi
   study to determine the degree to which these practices were essential
   for the successful delivery of Flash Track projects. These structured

Abstract = {{Involvement of the private sector in financing highway projects in the
   form of public-private partnerships (P3s) is subject to various
   limitations and challenges that affect P3 project planning and
   development, and limit the expansion of the U.S. highway P3 market.
   Public and private sector stakeholders need to have a better
   understanding of opportunities for improvement that can contribute to
   the U.S. highway P3 market growth and promote excellence in P3 project
   planning and development. The main objective of this study is to
   identify and explore opportunities that can help state DOTs facilitate
   transportation planning and procurement of highway P3s. Following
   interviews with twenty P3 industry experts, we categorize the enabling
   solutions and recommendations for development of highway P3s into five
   areas. The recommended enabling mechanisms are then analyzed in detail.
   Results indicate that state DOTs can establish mature and transparent P3
   programs in order to attract interested investors and promote the
   partnership culture between the public and private stakeholders. In
   addition, flexibilities in project procurement and consideration of
   operations and maintenance (O\&M) services as a separate contract can
   incentivize private sector involvement. Finally, requiring a quality
   management plan as part of P3 proposals can alleviate quality concerns
   on P3 projects.}},

Abstract = {{Significant volatility in the price of asphalt cement is one of the most
   important challenges for both state Departments of Transportation (state
   DOTs) and highway contractors for proper cost estimating and budgeting
   of their projects. The ability to model and forecast asphalt cement
   prices can result in more accurate cost estimation and budgeting.
   However, there is little knowledge about how asphalt cement price
   fluctuates over time. The research objective of this paper is to model
   and forecast the price of asphalt cement using Auto Regressive
   Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and Generalized Auto Regressive
   Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) time series forecasting model
   which can model and predict both conditional mean and conditional
   variance of a variable. After analyzing the major characteristics (i.e.,
   autocorrelation, stationarity, seasonality) of the time series of
   asphalt cement price, the primary conditional mean function is created
   using regular time series models such as Auto-Regressive Moving Average
   (ARMA). Then, by analyzing the residuals of this model, the conditional
   volatility of the price of asphalt cement is modeled using an ARCH/GARCH
   model. The results indicate that the developed model can predict the
   price of asphalt cement with less than 1.6\% error.}},

Abstract = {{Cost escalation is a critical issue that state departments of
   transportation (DOTs) face throughout project development from concept
   to completion. A variety of issues and risks impact budgeting and cost
   management and control activities, which affect adherence to approved
   project budgets. State DOTs need to utilize effective practices to avoid
   constant budget adjustments due to cost overruns. The objective of this
   study is to identify and analyze effective practices for controlling,
   updating, and maintaining the baseline budget and schedule for highway
   projects. Through comprehensive interviews with several state DOTs and
   an extensive content analysis of their guidebooks and manuals, we
   identify and analyze several effective practices, including those
   related to budget-based project development for controlling potential
   costs in the following areas of opportunity: (1) project scope and
   concept development; (2) concept-level risk identification and
   assessment; (3) preliminary and final design summary reporting; (4)
   value engineering and alternative analysis; and (5) cost estimate
   validation and review. Results of the analysis show that state DOTs
   struggle with identifying risk factors early in project development and
   mitigating them during preliminary and final design. The findings can
   help state DOTs improve their existing practices for highway project
   budgeting and cost management so that they can maintain initial baseline
   budgets and schedules while minimizing changes made to them during the
   project development process.}},

Abstract = {{The successful implementation of Building Information Models (BIMs) for
   facility management, maintenance, and operation is highly dependent on
   the ability to generate such models for existing assets. Generating such
   BIMs typically requires laser scanning to acquire point clouds and
   significant post-processing to register the clouds, replace the points
   with BIM objects, assign semantic relationships and add any additional
   properties, such as materials. Several research efforts have attempted
   to reduce the post-processing manual effort by classifying the
   structural elements and clutter in isolated rooms. They have not however
   examined the complexity of a whole building. In this paper, we propose a
   robust framework that can automatically process the point cloud of an
   entire building, possibly with multiple floors, and classify the points
   belonging to floors, walls and ceilings. We first extract the planar
   surfaces by segmenting the point cloud, and then we use contextual
   reasoning, such as height, orientation, relation to other objects, and
   local statistics like point density in order to classify them into
   objects. Experiments were conducted on a registered point cloud of an
   office building. The results indicated that almost all of the walls and
   floors/ceilings were correctly clustered in the point cloud.}},

Abstract = {{Construction cost index (CCI) is calculated monthly and published by
   Engineering News Record (ENR). It is the weighted average price of four
   major construction components from twenty cities in the U.S., and it
   generally represents the level of cost for the construction industry. It
   has, therefore, been widely used for cost estimation, bid preparation,
   and investment planning. Cost estimators and investment planners,
   however, are not only interested in the CCI at present, but are also
   interested in forecasting and predicting the value of CCI in near
   future. Although CCI increases over the long term, it is subject to
   considerable short-term volatilities, which make it problematic for cost
   estimators to accurately bid for construction projects. The accurate
   prediction of the construction cost can result in more accurate bids and
   avoid underestimation or overestimation. This paper presents a method
   that utilizes economic variables to predict CCI by applying the modified
   K nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It first identifies several
   economic variables that are highly correlated to CCI and collects the
   data for the period from 1994 to 2013. Then it splits the data into two
   parts: the first 95\% of the data as the training set and the last 5\%
   of the data as the test set. Finally, prediction models are developed by
   the training sets and tested on the test set to measure the prediction
   performance. Experimental results show that the modified KNN algorithm
   yields very small prediction error under the given dataset. It is
   anticipated that the proposed method will be useful for predicting CCI
   and several other construction time series indices in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have been increasingly considered for use

   with safety control processes during the construction phase. This
   technology can transfer visual assets, such as images and videos

   potentially hazardous situations occur. This paper aims to identify the
   user requirements, operational challenges, potential factors influencing
   the performance of UASs, and potential performance measures on
   construction site environments. In this study, qualitative survey
   responses are collected from 19 construction project professionals. The
   main findings showed four main requirements and three main challenges
   from a user's perspective in order to implement UASs on construction
   sites. In addition, 31 potential factors and 17 performance measures of
   UASs were identified with their importance based on mean ranking scores.
   ``Ease of user interface for UAS operation{''} and ``Quality of visual

Abstract = {{With enormous technological changes over the last decade, modern
   construction trends have become more complex and dynamic. This demands
   that construction professionals be more effective and organized to
   successfully complete their construction activities. However, recent
   research shows that current construction management techniques are
   ineffective. In addition, this research recognized the potential
   benefits of location awareness of construction resources in the
   construction management. The availability of location awareness
   information was identified to assist real-time decision making, provide
   more control over construction processes, and improve productivity and
   safety. In this context, this paper introduces an indoor location
   tracking system that integrates Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors and
   motion sensors with BIM. BLE Beacons were used to track a target by
   estimating its location. Motion sensors were used to enhance the quality
   of estimation. In addition, a BIM model was exploited to extract map
   knowledge for movement constraints. Two field tests were conducted at
   two indoor construction sites. Complex tracking scenarios were designed
   to thoroughly assess accuracy and reliability of the tracking system.
   The results demonstrated the capability of the proposed tracking system
   with an average accuracy of about 1 similar to 2 m, which indicated that
   the implementation of the BLE tracking system in construction
   applications would be effective and promising for potential widespread
   adoption.}},

   simulation engine were developed. The optimization engine generates
   multiple alternative scaffolding plans. The safety simulation engine
   simulates daily construction site conditions and automatically
   identifies potential safety hazards related to scaffolding. In a case
   study using a real world construction project, the optimization engine
   generated alternative scaffolding plans and the simulation engine
   successfully detected potential safety hazards. The construction and
   safety managers of a case study project could identify multiple
   scaffolding plans that were better than the original plan in terms of
   safety, cost, and duration. The overall results demonstrate that the
   proposed approach can assist in the creation of safer and more
   productive plans for scaffolding at a pre-construction stage.}},

Abstract = {{More than 70\% of all accidents in constructions are related to human
   activities. Many researches reveal that higher hazards are associated
   with the complexity of activities that workers are performing. More
   recent studies in the area of neural science and psychology suggests
   that many accidents are caused by the lack of attention or attention
   distractions. Laborers are vulnerable while they are focusing on
   complicated construction tasks that requires too much attention.
   Therefore, assessing the attention level of workers could help to
   determine their vulnerability. However, there is no available
   measurement metrics that can help project managers to quantitatively
   monitor construction workers' mental condition. By comparing multiple
   quantitatively assessment metrics, this research aims at proposing an
   integrated framework to enable the assessment of the concentration level
   and the vulnerability of construction workers through wearable
   electroencephalography (EEG) safety helmets.}},

   non-destructive evaluation technique for surface and structure health
   inspection. Background subtraction is a widely-used technique for
   automated defect detection. In background subtraction, an image of the

   subtracted from the defective part image; the resulted large differences
   are then considered as defects. In this paper, a new background
   generation technique is proposed that allows for efficient defect
   detection at a low-computational load. In this technique, a defect-free
   region is generated by approximately locating defects and removing them
   from the original image. The resulted defect-free region is now used to
   generate the background. The procedure and performance of the algorithm

Abstract = {{In structural sensing applications, wireless sensing systems have drawn
   great interest owing to faster installation process and lower system
   cost compared to the traditional cabled systems. As a new-generation
   wireless sensing system, Martlet features high-speed data acquisition
   and extensible layout, which allows easy interfacing with various types
   of sensors. This paper presents a field test of the Martlet sensing
   system installed at an in-service pre-stressed concrete highway bridge
   on SR113 over Dry Creek in Bartow County, Georgia. Four types of sensors
   are interfaced with Martlet in this test, including accelerometers,
   strain gages, strain transducers and magnetostrictive displacement
   sensors. In addition, thermocouples are used to monitor the temperature
   change of the bridge through the day. The acceleration, strain and
   displacement response of the bridge due to traffic and ambient
   excitations are measured. To obtain the modal properties of the bridge,
   hammer impact tests are also performed. The results from the field test
   demonstrate the reliability of the Martlet wireless sensing system. In
   addition, detailed modal properties of the bridge are extracted from the
   acceleration data collected in the test.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear elastic guided waves find application in various disciplines
   of science and engineering, such as non-destructive testing and
   structural health monitoring. Recent recognition and quantification of
   their amplitude dependent changes in spectral properties has contributed
   to the development of new monitoring concepts for mechanical structures.
   The focus of this work is to investigate and predict amplitude-dependent
   shifts in Lamb wave dispersion curves. The theory for
   frequency/wavenumber shifts for plate waves, based on a
   Lindstedt-Poincare perturbation approach, was presented by the authors
   in previous years. Equivalently, spectral properties changes can be seen
   as wavelength contraction/elongation.
   Within the proposed framework, the wavelength of a Lamb wave depends on
   several factors; e.g., wave amplitude and second-, third- and
   fourth-order elastic constants, and others. Various types of nonlinear
   effects are considered in presented studies. Sensitivity studies for
   model parameters, i.e. higher-order elastic constants, are performed to
   quantify their influence on Lamb wave frequency/wavenumber shifting, and
   to identify the key parameters governing wavelength tuning.}},

Abstract = {{Detection, localization, and characterization of impact damage in
   composites using in situ transducers are important objectives for the
   aerospace industry to both reduce maintenance costs and prevent
   failures. A network of piezoelectric transducers spatially distributed
   over an area of interest is one practical configuration for utilizing
   guided waves to accomplish these objectives. Detecting and localizing
   barely visible impact damage with such a sparse array has been
   demonstrated in prior work, and improvements in localization were
   demonstrated by incorporating fairly crude estimates of scattering
   patterns in the imaging algorithms. Here we obtain more estimates of
   scattering patterns from a simulated defect by employing baseline
   subtraction of wavefield data recorded in a circle centered at the
   scatterer. Scattering patterns are estimated from the wavefield residual
   signals before and after simulated damage is introduced and the
   estimated scattering patterns are then incorporated into sparse array
   imaging via the minimum variance imaging method. Images created with
   different scattering patterns are compared and the efficacy of the
   methodology is assessed.}},

Abstract = {{A broadband antenna inspired by a windmill sail is developed for
   wireless body area network (WBAN) applications. The antenna consists of
   a couple of modified dipoles with four crossed symmetrical S-shaped arms
   printed on a flexible sub-strate. A 5 x 5 unit structure of artificial
   magnetic conductor (AMC) is integrated to reduce the backward scattering
   wave toward the human body, and simultaneously ensures a low profile
   with a thickness of 5.74 mm and a small size with the area of 46 x 46
   mm(2). The measured results on the phantom reveal that the
   AMC-integrated antenna accomplishes an impedance bandwidth of 63.5\%
   (5.7-11.0 GHz) with S-11 < -10 dB, a peak gain of 8 dBi, and a
   front-to-back ratio (FBR) greater than 15 dB. Health safety factors,
   such as specific absorption rate and temperature, are considered.
   According to the calculation of link budget in different scenarios, the
   reliable communication can be guaranteed within 10 m in line-of-sight
   (LOS) environment. The good performances make the proposed
   AMC-integrated antenna potential for wireless communication between
   miniaturized wearable sensors and a localized base station around body.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of maximizing performance in multihop wireless
   networks while achieving fairness among flows. While time-based fairness
   has been widely recognized as the appropriate fairness mechanism in
   single-hop wireless networks, no analogous notion has been developed for
   multihop wireless networks. We define the first general notion of
   time-based fairness for multihop networks by abstracting a network into
   a virtual single-hop network and applying the single-hop time-based
   fairness notion. This produces rate shares for each flow in the network,
   and we develop a constructive method for achieving these rate shares
   through physical-interference-aware scheduling. When combined with an
   appropriate link transmission policy, this scheduling approach preserves
   the time-based-fair rate shares for flows even with spatial reuse and
   the resulting rate reductions that occur among concurrent links. To our
   best knowledge, this is the first constructive approach for achieving
   fair rate shares in multihop wireless networks with or without
   interference consideration. We also prove that, with an appropriate
   scheduling algorithm, this approach produces an aggregate rate that is
   within a constant factor of the maximum aggregate rate subject to
   time-based fairness. Finally, we perform extensive simulations, which
   show that our approach as much as doubles the aggregate rate of a
   solution that approximates max-min fairness, while achieving a more
   natural fairness property.}},

   Specifically, we quantify both the seed-based and the seed-free Relative
   De-anonymizability (RD) of graph data for both perfect DA (successfully
   de-anonymizing all the target users) and partial DA (where some DA error
   is tolerated) under a general data model. In our relative
   quantification, instead of treating all the users in graph data as
   structurally equivalent, we adaptively quantify their RD in terms of
   their structural importance. Leveraging 15 real world graph datasets, we
   validate the accuracy of our relative quantifications and compare them
   with state-of-the-art seed-based and seed-free quantification
   techniques. The results demonstrate that our structural importance-aware
   relative quantifications are more sound and precise when measuring graph

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional stacking has increased the memory bandwidth available
   to cores allowing sustainable performance improvement through technology
   generations. However, lower heat removal capability and higher DRAM
   density in such systems increases their temperature and requires larger
   number of rows to be refreshed at significantly higher rates. Higher
   operating temperature prohibits performance scaling by not only
   decreasing memory bandwidth availability but also reducing core
   frequency specially in the case where memory is stacked directly on top
   of the processor die (3D). Liquid cooling using microfluidics technology
   is a promising solution that keeps the temperature low increasing the
   operating range of 3D systems, thus allowing sustained performance
   improvement. This work attempts to understand the impact of temperature
   on performance and the advantages of using microfluidics technology for
   continued performance scaling. We show that conventional air cooling
   solutions limit 3D stacks to work only for memory-intensive applications
   running at low frequency, whereas microfluidics cooling technology allow
   them to push their envelope to not only compute intensive domains but
   also memory-intensive scenarios that can run at significantly higher
   operating frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Trilateration-based localization schemes typically extract the needed
   information, such as distances between transmitters and receivers, from
   noisy received signal strength (RSS) measurements specific to the
   employed technologies. Such applications employ non-stochastic methods
   without appropriately targeting noise. This paper proposes employing a
   recent optimal stochastic Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm with measurement
   noise rejection capability for a class of localization applications. In
   order to show the effectiveness of this algorithm, we numerically
   consider an anchor-free localization problem with random initial guess.
   Numerical results show that the proposed recursive algorithm provides
   significant improvement over the traditional NR method.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid adoption of software-based learning in classrooms, it is
   increasingly important to design more intelligent educational software,
   a goal of the emerging field of educational datamining. In this work, we
   analyze student activities from using a learning tool for engineers,
   Mechanix, in order to find trends that may be used to make the software
   a better tutor, combining its natural, sketch-based input with
   intelligent, experience-based feedback. We see a significant correlation
   between student performance and the amount of time they work on a
   problem before submitting; students who attempt to ``game{''} the system
   by submitting their results too often perform worse than those who work
   longer (p < 0.05). We also found significance in the number of times a
   student attempted a problem before moving on, with a strong correlation
   between being willing to switch among problems and better performance (p
   < 0.05). Overall, we find that student trends like these could be paired
   with machine learning techniques to make more intelligent educational
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Design sketching is an important and versatile skill for engineering
   students to master in order to translate their design thoughts
   effectively onto a visual medium, whether it is to proficiently produce
   hand-drawn sketches onto paper, seamlessly interact with intelligent
   sketch-based modeling interfaces, or reap the various educational
   benefits associated with drawing. Traditional instructional approaches
   for teaching design sketching are frequently constrained by the
   availability of experienced human instructors or the lack of supervised
   learning from self-practice, while relevant intelligent educational
   applications for sketch instruction have focused more on assessing
   users' art drawings or cognitive developmental progress. We introduce
   PerSketchTivity, an intelligent pen-based computing educational
   application that not only teaches engineering students how to hone and
   practice their design sketching skills through stylus-and-touchscreen
   interaction, but also aiding their motivation and self-regulated
   learning through real-time feedback. From the qualitative results of our
   usability tests of our application from eight university student
   participants of varying skill levels and disciplines, we observed that
   participants well-rated the usability of the application while also
   providing valuable feedback to improve the application even further.}},

Abstract = {{Current State of the art technologies for detecting and neutralizing
   rogue DHCP servers are tediously complex and prone to error. Network
   operators can spend hours (even days) before realizing that a rogue
   server is affecting their network. Additionally, once network operators
   suspect that a rogue server is active on their network, even more hours
   can be spent finding the server's MAC address and preventing it from
   affecting other clients. Not only are such methods slow to eliminate
   rogue servers, they are also likely to affect other clients as network
   operators shutdown services while attempting to locate the server. In
   this paper, we present Network Flow Guard (NFG), a simple security
   application that utilizes the software defined networking (SDN) paradigm
   of programmable networks to detect and disable rogue servers before they
   are able to affect network clients. Consequently, the key contributions
   of NFG are its modular approach and its automated detection/prevention
   of rogue DHCP servers, which is accomplished with little impact to
   network architecture, protocols, and network operators.}},

Abstract = {{Large-granularity memory failures continue to be a critical impediment
   to system reliability. To make matters worse, as DRAM scales to smaller
   nodes, the frequency of unreliable bits in DRAM chips continues to
   increase. To mitigate such scaling-related failures, memory vendors are
   planning to equip existing DRAM chips with On-Die ECC. For maintaining
   compatibility with memory standards, On-Die ECC is kept invisible from
   the memory controller.
   This paper explores how to design high reliability memory systems in
   presence of On-Die ECC. We show that if OnDie ECC is not exposed to the
   memory system, having a 9-chip ECC-DIMM (implementing SECDED) provides
   almost no reliability benefits compared to an 8-chip non-ECC DIMM. We
   also show that if the error detection of On-Die ECC can be exposed to
   the memory controller, then Chipkill-level reliability can be achieved
   even with a 9-chip ECC-DIMM. To this end, we propose eXposed On-Die
   Error Detection (XED), which exposes the On-Die error detection
   information without requiring changes to the memory standards or
   consuming bandwidth overheads. When the On-Die ECC detects an error, XED
   transmits a pre-defined ``catch-word{''} instead of the corrected data
   value. On receiving the catch-word, the memory controller uses the
   parity stored in the 9-chip of the ECC-DIMM to correct the faulty chip
   (similar to RAID-3). Our studies show that XED provides Chipkill-level
   reliability (172x higher than SECDED), while incurring negligible
   overheads, with a 21\% lower execution time than Chipkill. We also show
   that XED can enable Chipkill systems to provide Double-Chipkill level
   reliability while avoiding the associated storage, performance, and
   power overheads.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a programmable and scalable digital neuromorphic
   architecture based on 3D high-density memory integrated with logic tier
   for efficient neural computing. The proposed architecture consists of
   clusters of processing engines, connected by 2D mesh network as a
   processing tier, which is integrated in 3D with multiple tiers of DRAM.
   The PE clusters access multiple memory channels ( vaults) in parallel.
   The operating principle, referred to as the memory centric computing,
   embeds specialized state-machines within the vault controllers of HMC to
   drive data into the PE clusters. The paper presents the basic
   architecture of the Neurocube and an analysis of the logic tier
   synthesized in 28nm and 15nm process technologies. The performance of
   the Neurocube is evaluated and illustrated through the mapping of a
   Convolutional Neural Network and estimating the subsequent power and
   performance for both training and inference.}},

Abstract = {{Ambitious aircraft emission goals combined with airline fuel costs are
   driving an increasing focus on energy efficiency for the aircraft
   industry. Aircraft Equipment Systems (AES) perform key aircraft
   functions, such as pressurization or control surface actuation, but they
   are also energy consumers. Selecting the AES technologies of the future
   is inherently a multi-criteria problem if all stakeholders are to be
   satisfied. The problem is further complicated because technologies
   cannot be considered to be completely independent and must be considered
   from a subsystem architecture perspective. This paper proposes an
   evolution of the Strategic Prioritization and Planning (SP2) method
   including a two-level approach that considers both independent
   technologies and integrated architectures. These are then linked to
   technology attributes and high-level objectives through qualitative
   subject matter expert driven relationships. The information is finally
   displayed in an interactive environment that ranks technologies and
   architectures, while also allowing the decision maker to define and
   explore the scenarios driving the rankings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a process developed to utilize information within
   an ontology, a form of a component model library, for design space
   refinement in conceptual design through the use of an Interactive
   Reconfigurable Matrix of Alternatives (IRMA). An ontological approach is
   proposed, as it enhances the capabilities of component model libraries
   that are already being constructed for use in model-based systems
   engineering (MBSE) programs. By defining a common vocabulary across
   multiple design domains, an ontology is capable of driving information
   consistency and reducing errors that occur due to misinterpretation of
   common vernacular. Within an ontology, a functional decomposition of any
   complex system can be represented as a hierarchy of ``classes{''}, where
   a class defines any concept within a given domain. The functions that
   each system must perform, along with the system components that achieve
   each function and the design alternatives for each component, are
   related to the system as properties of the system. This functional
   decomposition structure of the ontology may be identical to the
   decomposition that is used in an IRMA, which can use information
   exported from the ontology to perform design space refinement during
   conceptual design. The result of this study is a process which is
   capable of extracting information from an ontology, organizing it, and
   importing it directly to an IRMA which is fully functional and ready to
   be used. Such a process becomes a powerful capability when similar
   systems are designed, as the process can be reused, serving as a
   starting point for concept selection in conceptual design, resulting in
   reductions in both development time and cost.}},

   of a seismic image, we detect the salt domes. Experimental results show
   the effectiveness of SalSi on the real seismic dataset acquired from the
   North Sea, F3 block. Subjectively, we have used the ground truth and the
   output of different salt dome delineation algorithms to validate the
   results of SalSi. For the objective evaluation of results, we have used
   the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the

Abstract = {{We propose a new framework for automatic image annotation (AIA) of
   regions through segmentation based semantic analysis and discriminative
   classification. Given a test image, it is first segmented by a proposed
   texture-enhanced JSEG algorithm. Then these regions are represented by
   an extended bag-of-words model in which a feature vector, based on a
   visual lexicon with its vocabulary consisting of a visual word or a
   co-occurrence of multiple visual words, is constructed to represent the
   region content. Finally a concept classifier learned by a maximal
   figure-of-merit algorithm is used to predict the region labels. These
   models are discriminatively trained from image regions with multiple
   associations between regions and concepts. Experiments on a subset of
   the Corel 5K data set illustrate that our proposed approach to region
   AIA achieves more accurate annotation results than some sate-of-the-art

Abstract = {{We propose the use of speech attributes, such as voicing and aspiration,
   to address two key research issues in computer assisted pronunciation
   training (CAPT) for L2 learners, namely detecting mispronunciation and
   providing diagnostic feedback. To improve the performance we focus on
   mispronunciations occurred at the segmental and sub-segmental levels. In
   this study, speech attributes scores are first used to measure the
   pronunciation quality at a sub-segmental level, such as manner and place
   of articulation. These speech attribute scores are integrated by neural
   network classifiers to generate segmental pronunciation scores. Compared
   with the conventional phone-based GOP (Goodness of Pronunciation) system
   we implement with our dataset, the proposed framework reduces the equal
   error rate by 8.78\% relative. Moreover, it attains comparable results
   to phone-based classifier approach to mispronunciation detection while
   providing comprehensive feedback, including segmental and sub-segmental
   diagnostic information, to help L2 learners.}},

   resting-state brain to be in quasi-static states with spontaneous
   switching between them. First, we apply a hidden Markov model to the
   resting state fMRI data and derive model parameters reflecting the
   states. With this approach, we identified 9 reproducible states, which
   resemble resting state networks described in the literature. The second
   piece of work is the dynamic parcellations of thalamus, leading the
   state specific parcellations and their merged results, both of which
   revealed new insights about the thalamic function and connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a biologically-inspired low-level
   spatiochromatic-model-based similarity method (BLeSS) to assist
   full-reference image-quality estimators that originally oversimplify
   color perception processes. More specifically, the spatiochromatic model
   is based on spatial frequency, spatial orientation, and surround
   contrast effects. The assistant similarity method is used to complement
   image-quality estimators based on phase congruency, gradient magnitude,
   and spectral residual. The effectiveness of BLeSS is validated using
   FSIM, FSIMc and SR-SIM methods on LIVE, Multiply Distorted LIVE, and TID
   2013 databases. In terms of Spearman correlation, BLeSS enhances the
   performance of all quality estimators in color-based degradations and
   the enhancement is at 100\% for both feature-and spectral residual-based
   similarity methods. Moreover, BleSS significantly enhances the
   performance of SR-SIM and FSIM in the full TID 2013 database.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a software policy for memory management in
   heterogeneous memory systems in order to improve the trade-offs between
   performance and power consumption, while attempting to make the best use
   of different characteristics of the underlying memory technologies. In
   this policy, the operating system and the application co-schedule page
   management in order to make informed decisions about page allocation and
   migration. Software-Controlled 2-Level Memory (Soft2LM) is a
   hardware-agnostic approach for efficient usage of heterogeneous memory
   that allows for region-based allocations, migrations, and application
   advice. We include analysis of the access characteristics of the PARSEC
   3.0 suite of benchmarks, both as motivation for software-guided
   intelligent page placement as well as for understanding where
   application advice can make a difference. Our evaluation running PARSEC
   on our Soft2LM Linux kernel shows an average 4.7x improvement over
   comparable RAMDISK-based swapping. Even when migrating 100 and 1000
   pages per second between regions, Soft2LM performs comparably to a stock
   system with twice the available DRAM, showing a 1.8\% and 0.7\%

Abstract = {{A handful of recent cryptographic proposals rely on the conjectured
   hardness of the following problem in the ring of integers of a
   cyclotomic number field: given a basis of a principal ideal that is
   guaranteed to have a ``rather short{''} generator, find such a
   generator. Recently, Bernstein and Campbell-Groves-Shepherd sketched
   potential attacks against this problem; most notably, the latter authors
   claimed a polynomial-time quantum algorithm. (Alternatively, replacing
   the quantum component with an algorithm of Biasse and Fieker would yield
   a classical subexponential-time algorithm.) A key claim of Campbell et
   al. is that one step of their algorithm-namely, decoding the log-unit
   lattice of the ring to recover a short generator from an arbitrary
   one-is classically efficient (whereas the standard approach on general
   lattices takes exponential time). However, very few convincing details
   were provided to substantiate this claim.
   In this work, we clarify the situation by giving a rigorous proof that
   the log-unit lattice is indeed efficiently decodable, for any cyclotomic
   of prime-power index. Combining this with the quantum algorithm from a
   recent work of Biasse and Song confirms the main claim of Campbell et
   al. Our proof consists of two main technical contributions: the first is
   a geometrical analysis, using tools from analytic number theory, of the
   standard generators of the group of cyclotomic units. The second shows
   that for a wide class of typical distributions of the short generator, a
   standard lattice-decoding algorithm can recover it, given any generator.
   By extending our geometrical analysis, as a second main contribution we
   obtain an efficient algorithm that, given any generator of a principal
   ideal (in a prime-power cyclotomic), finds a 2((O) over tilde(root
   n))-approximate shortest vector in the ideal. Combining this with the
   result of Biasse and Song yields a quantum polynomial-time algorithm for
   the 2((O) over tilde(root n))-approximate Shortest Vector Problem on
   principal ideal lattices.}},

Pages = {{658-674}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an on-board charger with a parallel-connected LC
   circuit which works in coordination with the previously-proposed
   universal charger to achieve ``real{''} universal inductive charging.
   For accurately tracking the optimal frequency and achieving soft
   switching of the primary charger, an additional inductor is connected in
   series with the P-connected resonant tank to form an ``LCL{''} topology.
   Based on the voltage gain of the proposed resonant topology, a step-down
   DC-DC converter is used to generate standard charging voltage and
   current to EV batteries. The detailed design method of the LCL circuit
   and DC-DC converter is provided. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that
   the proposed LCL-compensated secondary resonant circuit has a stable
   output voltage vs varied magnetic coupling and load. Compared with
   series-compensated LC circuits, the proposed topology has two main
   advantages: a smaller range of the varied optimal AC frequency vs
   magnetic couplings and a much lower voltage stress on the resonant
   capacitance. Experiments based on a prototype of inductive charging
   system prove that the proposed on-board charger has high DC-DC
   efficiency, a smaller range of AC frequency, and a universally-achieved
   stable output.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the PRISM trial was to examine the potential benefits of a
   Personal Reminder Information and Social Management (PRISM) computer
   system on the well-being and perceived social support of an older adult
   sample at risk for social isolation. Participants (N = 300) were
   randomly assigned to receive the PRISM system, which was designed to
   support social connections, information gathering, prospective memory,
   and access to local and national resources, or a binder that contained
   similar information. The intervention lasted one year, and the computer
   usage of the PRISM group was monitored. This trial represented a unique
   opportunity to explore potential barriers to the adoption and continued
   use of information and communications technologies. Specifically, this
   paper explored the relationship between computer proficiency and use of
   the PRISM system over time. Contrary to what one might predict,
   participants with initially low proficiency used the system more over
   the course of the trial (r(123) = -.22, p < .05). The fact that even
   those with the lowest levels or proficiency were able to become among
   the most active PRISM users may reflect that the system was designed
   well for older adult computer novices (the intended target of the
   intervention). Over the course of the trial, participants assigned to
   the PRISM condition improved substantially in their computer
   proficiency. Increased computer proficiency from baseline to 12 months
   was a much strong predictor of system use (r(123) = .53, p < .001),
   possibly reflecting increased proficiency as a result of greater use
   over time. Overall, data suggest a complex relationship between computer
   use, computer proficiency, and changes in computer proficiency over time
   worthy of additional exploration to further understand the effects of,
   and barriers to, the use of information and communications technologies.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{A fixed evolutionary mechanism is usually adopted in the multiobjective
   evolutionary algorithms and their operators are static during the
   evolutionary process, which causes the algorithm not to fully exploit
   the search space and is easy to trap in local optima. In this paper, a
   SPEA2 algorithm which is based on adaptive selection evolution operators
   (AOSPEA) is proposed. The proposed algorithm can adaptively select
   simulated binary crossover, polynomial mutation, and differential
   evolution operator during the evolutionary process according to their
   contribution to the external archive. Meanwhile, the convergence
   performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed with Markov chain.
   Simulation results on the standard benchmark functions reveal that the

Abstract = {{In a dual-carrier vital sign detection system, we have designed a noise
   suppression scheme that uses phase locked loop (PLL) to automatically
   suppress the noise induced by range correlation and transmission paths.
   The system uses two microwave carriers at 5.6 and 5.68 GHz generated by
   two phase locked signal generators to extract the noise and vital sign
   respectively. The feedback microwave signals are mixed with local
   5.68-GHz signal to transfer to the vial sign signal and low frequency
   intermediate frequency (IF) signal. When the IF signal corresponding to
   5.68 GHz microwave signal is locked to a highly stable low noise
   reference, the noises of IF signal and vital sign signal are suppressed
   as their corresponding microwave signals are highly correlated. In this
   system, the noise suppression performance is related to the bandwidth of
   the PLL, which needs to be carefully designed. Through the theoretical
   analysis, initial bandwidth is chosen to be 200 Hz. Then the charge pump
   current is changed to adjust the bandwidth and the corresponding noise
   suppression performance is evaluated using experiments. The results show
   the system with a charge pump current 0.625 mA, which corresponds to
   about 50 Hz bandwidth, exhibits a better noise performance. In addition,
   at different bandwidth, the vital sign detection system is compared with
   a design scheme with unlocked PLL and demonstrates superior performance
   at all bandwidths.}},

Abstract = {{Outsource encrypted data is a popular trend for storing sensitive data
   in third party clouds. Many cloud applications need privacy preserving
   data encryption services with two capabilities: On one hand, they need
   querying over encrypted data in Web based data hosting services. On the
   other hand, they also need to keep the query keywords and associated
   search operations private such that data hosting service providers
   cannot gain access to unauthorized content or trace and infer sensitive
   data stored in the third party data hosting servers. In this paper we
   present a novel service oriented framework for verifiable searchable
   asymmetric encryption, called PVSAE. PVSAE offers strong support for
   outsourced encrypted data with two formal security properties in terms
   of IND-CKA security and search pattern privacy. Our framework supports
   two concrete PVSAE schemes. The first scheme l-PVSAE is based on the
   l-dimensional vectors and achieves strong security notions, namely
   statistical IND-CKA security and statistical search pattern privacy. The
   second scheme 3-PVSAE is a light-weight version based on 3-dimensional
   vectors. 3-PVSAE maintains the strong security properties and offers
   higher efficiency for search over encrypted data compared with existing
   verifiable searchable asymmetric encryption schemes. We experimentally
   evaluate the proposed PVSAE schemes and show that they not only offer
   strong security but also are practical and deployable.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids have become attractive electricity supply and management
   options that support local power generation, increased reliability,
   sustainability, and cost reductions. Microgrid sources often include
   solar PV, wind, and a thermal generation. Thermal generation alone has
   low conversion efficiency. On the other hand, a combined heat and power
   (CHP) generator provides additional benefits by taking advantage of the
   exhaust heat from the generator to fulfill the thermal demand of a
   building. Thus an integrated microgrid that includes renewable energy
   and a CHP unit to serve electrical and thermal loads of buildings can
   achieve higher overall efficiency. In this paper, we model a thermal and
   electrical energy microgrid, which accounts for the nonlinear efficiency
   of a Capstone CHP unit and the thermal dynamics of a building. We
   present the steady-state model as well as the optimization scheduling
   formulation to minimize the integrated operating cost of the microgrids.
   The model is simulated under three electricity pricing structures to
   gain insight into the impacts of pricing on the daily operation of the
   microgrid.}},

Abstract = {{Transformers are protected by relays to ensure the overall reliability
   of the generation, transmission, and distribution electric systems.
   Among all kinds of transformer faults, the inter-turn faults are
   considered to be the most difficult faults to be detected. Inter-turn
   faults are extremely harmful to power transformers. When only few turns
   are shorted at the windings, the currents in the shorted loop can be
   very high while the transformer terminal currents change little. It is
   very difficult for the commercial relays or legacy protection methods to
   detect the existence of inter-turn faults. In this paper, the dynamic
   state estimation (DSE) based protection scheme is used to detect
   inter-turn faults. This method monitors the transformer terminal
   measurements, and it feeds the measurement data and transformer model to
   a dynamic state estimator. A chi-square test is performed to evaluate
   the probability (confidence-level) that the transformer model matches
   measurement data. Any mismatch between the model and measurement
   indicates something wrong inside the transformer, and protection action
   should be taken. Numerical simulations are conducted on a 115/10kV
   three-phase transformer with a 1\% inter-turn fault. Three protection
   methods are compared, namely the percentage-differential scheme,
   negative-sequence differential scheme and the proposed DSE-based scheme.
   Analysis shows that the DSE-based protection is more sensitive and
   reliable than the other two methods, and in general provides faster
   protection speed.}},

   discusses methods to model secondary circuits when the loads and
   distributed energy resources are only partially metered. The presented
   methods are demonstrated on a real distribution secondary circuit with
   smart meter measurements and transformer low voltage measurements.
   Practical challenges related to real measurement data are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic state estimation (DSE) based protection algorithm using
   weighted least square (WLS) method was introduced recently. In this
   paper, the DSE-based protection algorithm using constraint weighted
   least squares (CWLS) method is applied to capacitor bank protection.
   This approach monitors the health status of the capacitor bank by
   fitting real time measurements to the capacitor bank dynamic model via
   dynamic state estimation. Virtual measurements are added to the
   measurements set by considering the physical laws that must be obeyed by
   the capacitor bank (i.e. KVL, KCL). Virtual measurements can be handled
   as measurements with high accuracy or as constraints to the dynamic
   state estimation. The CWLS method treats the virtual measurements as
   constraints while the WLS method treats them as highly accuracy
   measurements. Comparison of capacitor bank protection results using
   unconstraint WLS and CWLS is provided. It is shown that the proposed
   method can detect internal faults and issue the trip signal correctly
   The use of CWLS provides a more sensitive protection for capacitor
   banks.}},

   A conceptual prototype of a crack cleaning device was designed by
   utilizing pneumatic power for air blasting and abrasive wire brushing to
   remove simultaneously de-icing chemicals and other debris. For the
   validation of the CCD in the field and industry acceptance of the CCD
   technology, several industry demonstrations and field tests were
   conducted. Productivity data along with the crews' feedback were
   collected during the field tests. The productivity and cost data of
   traditional methods were compared to the ones of the CCD. The analyzed
   results showed that the CCD design concepts have been well received by
   all participating industry who expects the CCD would positively impact
   the highway road maintenance by improving productivity, safety, and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{870-877}},
Abstract = {{Unbound aggregate bases are the primary structural components in many
   flexible pavements. The response of the unbound aggregate base is
   critical to the overall performance of the pavement, particularly in
   inverted base pavements given the proximity of the base to the traffic
   loads. The behaviour of granular materials such as unbound aggregate
   bases is inherently nonlinear and anisotropic. An experimental
   methodology is developed to assess the in-situ stress-dependent
   small-strain stiffness of unbound aggregate bases under controlled load
   using wave propagation techniques. CODA wave analysis is used to detect
   small changes in travel time. The methodology is applied in two distinct
   case histories of inverted base pavements. Results show that
   field-compacted granular bases exhibit higher stiffness, lower stress
   sensitivity and more pronounced anisotropy than laboratory-compacted
   specimens. The discrepancy in stiffness observed among the two field
   case histories is primarily attributed to traffic preconditioning
   sustained by the older pavement. Additional results show that the effect
   of suction on the stiffness of coarse-grained granular bases is
   insignificant.}},

Pages = {{A2185-A2196}},
Abstract = {{In lithium-ion batteries, chemical additives are used as co-solvents to
   primary electrolytes to improve capacity and power retention. These
   additives facilitate the formation of a passivation layer, the solid
   electrolyte interphase (SEI), on the electrode surface. In this work,
   SEIs are formed in neat electrolyte and in electrolyte containing
   fluoroethylene carbonate and vinylene carbonate. The formed SEIs are
   then compared using a redox couple to probe their physical properties.
   For passivated samples, the impedance response of the redox couple shows
   the presence of multiple time constants, with processes at longer time
   scales corresponding to redox couple transport in the porous layer of
   the SEI. Samples passivated with additive-containing electrolyte versus
   neat electrolyte exhibit less redox-couple kinetic and mass-transport
   impedance. Simulations of the electrode-electrolyte interface indicate
   that compact and porous layer growth lead to slowed redox kinetics and
   mass transport. Model results suggest that SEI thicknesses are found to
   be at least an order of magnitude larger than expected compared to
   graphite electrodes. SEM cross sections of SEIs formed by neat and
   additive-containing electrolyte support the model findings.
   Experimentally measured formation charges, coupled with FTIR
   measurements of SEI composition, suggest that polymerization reactions
   are causing the unexpected film growth. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

Abstract = {{Design issues, dynamic modeling, trajectory planning, and feedback
   control problems are presented for robot manipulators having components
   with mechanical flexibility, either concentrated at the joints or
   distributed along the links. The chapter is divided accordingly into two
   main parts. Similarities or differences between the two types of
   flexibility are pointed out wherever appropriate.
   For robots with flexible joints, the dynamic model is derived in detail
   by following a Lagrangian approach and possible simplified versions are
   discussed. The problem of computing the nominal torques that produce a
   desired robot motion is then solved. Regulation and trajectory tracking
   tasks are addressed by means of linear and nonlinear feedback control
   designs.
   For robots with flexible links, relevant factors that lead to the
   consideration of distributed flexibility are analyzed. Dynamic models
   are presented, based on the treatment of flexibility through lumped
   elements, transfer matrices, or assumed modes. Several specific issues
   are then highlighted, including the selection of sensors, the model
   order used for control design, and the generation of effective commands
   that reduce or eliminate residual vibrations in rest-to-rest maneuvers.
   Feedback control alternatives are finally discussed.
   In each of the two parts of this chapter, a section is devoted to the
   illustration of the original references and to further readings on the
   subject.}},

   offer. This type of software is a vital part of what is known as
   e-Commerce, with a variety of business models proposed and implemented.
   Lately, a new era of free-ware mobile application has arisen with paid
   features and promoted content in them. Piracy is not only the weakest
   point of software's financial ecosystem for conventional computing
   systems but also for smartphones. Actions like replication,
   redistribution and licensing violations can cause financial losses of
   colossal extent to their creators. Mobile applications also introduce
   the following peculiarity: They are distributed through predefined
   channels (Application Stores) owned by mobile operating system vendors
   such as Apple, Google and Microsoft. In this research we present several
   scenarios where cracked and modified applications can be freely used
   into every non jailbroken iOS device. Moreover it is demonstrated that
   not even in strict mobile environments, such as Apple's, end-users
   should be considered as trusted entities from application developers by
   default.}},

Abstract = {{NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) is an underwater
   spaceflight analog that allows a true mission-like operational
   environment and uses buoyancy effects and added weight to simulate
   different gravity levels. Three missions were undertaken from 2014-2015,
   NEEMO 18-20. All missions were performed at the Florida International
   University's Aquarius Reef Base, an undersea research habitat. During
   each mission, the effects of communication latencies on operations
   concepts, timelines, and tasks were studied. METHODS: Twelve subjects (4
   per mission) were weighed out to simulate near-zero or partial gravity
   extravehicular activity (EVA) and evaluated different operations
   concepts for integration and management of a simulated Earth-based
   science team (ST) to provide input and direction during exploration
   activities. Exploration traverses were preplanned based on precursor
   data. Subjects completed science-related tasks including presampling
   surveys, geologic-based sampling, and marine-based sampling as a portion
   of their tasks on saturation dives up to 4 hours in duration that were
   designed to simulate EVA on Mars or the moons of Mars. One-way
   communication latencies, 5 and 10 minutes between space and mission
   control, were simulated throughout the missions. Objective data included
   task completion times, total EVA times, crew idle time, translation
   time, ST assimilation time (defined as time available for ST to discuss
   data/imagery after data acquisition). Subjective data included
   acceptability, simulation quality, capability assessment ratings, and
   comments. RESULTS : Precursor data can be used effectively to plan and
   execute exploration traverse EVAs (plans included detailed location of
   science sites, high-fidelity imagery of the sites, and directions to
   landmarks of interest within a site). Operations concepts that allow for
   presampling surveys enable efficient traverse execution and meaningful
   Mission Control Center (MCC) interaction across communication latencies
   and can be done with minimal crew idle time. Imagery and contextual
   information from the EVA crew that is transmitted real-time to the
   intravehicular activity (IVA) crewmember(s) can be used to verify that
   exploration traverse plans are being executed correctly. That same data
   can be effectively used by MCC (across comm latency) to provide
   meaningful feedback and instruction to the crew regarding sampling
   priorities, additional tasks, and changes to the EVA timeline. Text /
   data capabilities are preferred over voice capabilities between MCC and
   IVA when executing exploration traverse plans over communication
   latency.}},

Abstract = {{Obsolescence is a distinctive state of both (physical) products and
   information, and it is commonly defined as the condition of being
   outdated or no longer useful. For the U.S Department of Defense (DoD),
   obsolescence is a serious matter that affects a host of military
   systems, by making it challenging to procure specific parts needed to
   build or repair them. For commercial engineering systems, obsolescence
   is an important determinant of the loss of competitive edge or
   advantage. System obsolescence is in part due to the tension between the
   increasingly longer design lifetimes of systems on the one hand, and the
   shorter life cycles of the underlying technologies embedded in the
   systems on the other hand. Faster changes in market needs and
   expectations are also important drivers of system obsolescence. As such,
   obsolescence and technology innovation are dual concepts that mirror
   each other in an inverse or negative relationship.
   In this work, we investigate two related issues: the notion of system
   obsolescence in general, and its particular manifestation in the case of
   spacecraft. Our objective is to contribute to a better understanding of
   this phenomenon and its consequences in general, and of spacecraft
   obsolescence in particular. This understanding is a necessary first step
   for better managing and mitigating the risk of obsolescence. To this
   effect, we first provide a multidisciplinary literature review of
   obsolescence, from economics to operations research. We then examine
   obsolescence as it pertains to engineering items and its relationship to
   product lifecycle. Since we are concerned in this work with system
   obsolescence instead of component obsolescence, we do not examine
   ``cohort effects{''} such as sales volume of a given item, as is
   traditionally done in the literature on the subject. Instead, we focus
   on the value generated by a single system, and we connect obsolescence
   with the loss of remaining system value. We argue that obsolescence
   decreases the value delivery profile of a system over time, and we
   develop the analytics to support and illustrate this proposition. We
   adapt our obsolescence model to spacecraft and examine various
   consequences of the onset and intensity of obsolescence on the
   spacecraft value. We provide several recommendations based on our
   findings. We introduce an obsolescence map as a visualization tool to
   help rank different payloads for which obsolescence mitigation ought to
   be prioritized. We make the case that the time to peak of the net value
   of a system, given its exposure to obsolescence, ought to be an
   important consideration when selecting an ``optimal{''} design lifetime
   for the system. We also suggest that the value implications of system
   obsolescence can serve as a valuation standard for obsolescence
   mitigation strategies and provide an upper bound on the
   willingness-to-pay for their implementations (e.g., flexible payloads).}},

Abstract = {{The Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP) is a unique program where a
   combination of scientific research and human space exploration concepts
   are integrated in an underwater spaceflight analog environment. The 2015

   where science-driven exploration techniques focused on microbialite
   characterization and acquisition. These techniques were evaluated within
   the context of crew and robotic deep-space extravehicular activity (EVA)
   operations. The primary objective of this analog study was to detail the
   capabilities, decision-making processes, and operational concepts
   required to meet non-simulated scientific objectives during 5-minute
   one-way communication latency utilizing crew and robotic assets. The
   relationship and interaction between ground and flight crew was found to

Abstract = {{The employment of long-term evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum,
   known as LTE-U, can alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem in the 5G
   networks. With this new technique, the traditional mobile data
   offloading schemes, which generally offload LTE users to the WiFi
   network, should be revisited. In this paper, we propose to transfer WiFi
   users to the LTE-U network and simultaneously allocate some unlicensed
   spectrum to LTE-U. In this way, a win-win situation could be generated
   since LTE can achieve better spectrum efficiency than WiFi in the
   unlicensed spectrum. To facilitate it, three important challenges are
   addressed in the paper: which WiFi users should be transferred; how many
   WiFi users need to be transferred; and how much unlicensed resource
   should be allocated to the LTE network. We utilize the Nash bargaining
   solution to design fair unlicensed spectrum allocation between WiFi and
   LTE-U and thereby a win-win strategy is developed, whose performance is
   demonstrated by numerical simulation.}},

   provide dynamic leading or lagging reactive power. In addition, the
   phases are coupled through a high-frequency transformer for inter-phase

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most
   promising converter technologies for medium/high-power applications,
   specifically for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission
   systems. One of the technical challenges associated with the operation
   and control of the MMCbased system is to precharge the submodule (SM)
   capacitors to their nominal voltages during the startup process. In this
   paper, considering various SM circuits, a general precharging strategy
   is proposed for the MMC-based systems under ac-and dc-side startup
   conditions. The proposed startup method does not require any additional
   feedback control loop, extra measurements, and/or auxiliary power
   supplies. Based on the developed startup method, the charging current is
   controllable by adjusting the changing rate of the number of blocked and
   bypassed SM capacitors. Performance of the proposed strategy for various
   MMCs is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the
   PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.}},

Title = {{THE EFFECTS OF AIR-ASSIST UPON LIQUID FUEL JET PENETRATION AND
   DISPERSION IN A CROSS-FLOWOF PREHEATED AIR}},
Journal = {{ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1177-1196}},
Abstract = {{Modern gas turbines employ fuel-air mixers that utilize
   jet-in-cross-flow (JICF) fuel injection to achieve rapid fuel-air
   mixing. In recent years, air-assist JICF has been investigated to
   improve the atomization and fuel dispersion qualities provided by JICF.
   This article reports the results of an experimental investigation where
   liquid Jet-A was injected into a cross-flow at temperatures and
   pressures of 316 degrees-427 degrees C and 2.02-2.53 MPa, respectively,
   while four streams of assist air, supplied from slots in a well,
   impinged on the fuel jet. The effects of air-assist and
   fuel-to-cross-flow momentum ratio (J) upon the fuel jet's outer-edge
   trajectories and wake-region dispersion patterns were investigated using
   two shadowgraph approaches that used (1) 511 nm visible light at 21 kHz
   pulse rate and (2) 266/532 nm UV/visible light for multiphase detection.
   In the experiments, J was varied between 15 and 130, while the
   air-assist flow rates were varied by changing the percentage pressure
   drop (dP) between the assist-air supply line and the cross-flow air
   between 0\% and 5\%, corresponding to 0\%-25\% of fuel mass flow rate
   when J = 15. The measured data were used to develop correlations for the
   air-assist JICF's outer-edge trajectories, using an effective momentum
   ratio (J(eff)) that accounts for the effects of air-assist. It was
   observed that while air-assist had minor effects upon the spray's
   outer-edge trajectories, it significantly affected fuel dispersion
   within the spray's wake. At higher temperatures and pressures, the
   outer-edge trajectories were more sensitive to air-assist. Notably,
   there were no significant differences between the outer-edge
   trajectories obtained via UV and visible light shadowgraphs, indicating
   that the outer-edge regions of the spray largely consisted of liquid. In
   contrast, similar comparisons suggested high concentrations of gaseous
   fuel in the wake, especially at higher temperatures and pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Seeking to control free rotations of a microsphere in a laser trap, we
   have created a ``Maxwell's demon{''} that identifies and captures a
   preferred ``up-or-down{''} polarity of the microsphere. Breaking
   rotational symmetry, we attach a single ``Raleigh-size{''} nanoparticle
   to a micron-size sphere, which establishes a ``nanodirector{''} defining
   microsphere orientations in a trap. With radius <10\% of the NIR
   trapping wavelength (1.064 mu m), a polystyrene nanoparticle appended to
   a similar to 1.3 mu m glass sphere adds negligibly to scattering of the
   trapping beam and imperceptibly to forces trapping a doublet probe. Yet,
   constrained to a large orbit (similar to 1.5 mu m diameter), the weak
   Raleigh dipole force induced in the nanoparticle imparts significant
   pole-attracting torques to the probe. At the same time, Brownian-thermal
   excitations contribute torque fluctuations to the probe randomizing
   orientations. Thus, we have combined demon control and Boltzmann
   thermodynamics to examine the intense competition between photonic
   torques aligning the nanodirector to the optical axis and the entropy
   confinement opposing alignment when equilibrated over long times for an
   order of magnitude span in laser powers. To reveal orientation, we
   developed novel multistep pattern-processing software to expose and
   enhance weak-diffuse visible light scattered from the nanoparticle.
   Processing a continuous stream of doublet images offline at similar to
   700 fps, the final step is to super resolve the transverse XY origin of
   the scattering pattern relative to the synchronous probe center, albeit
   limited to ``up{''} state segments because of intensity. Transforming
   the dense histograms (similar to 10(4)-10(5)) of radial positions to
   polar angle (theta) distributions, we plot the results on a natural log
   scale versus sin(theta) to quantify the photonic potentials aligning the
   nanodirector to the optical axis. Then guided by principles of canonical
   thermodynamics, we invoke self-consistent methodology to reveal photonic
   potentials in the ``down{''} state.}},

Abstract = {{There is an enormous potential for energy generation from the mixing of
   sea and river water at global estuaries. If technologies are developed
   which are capable of converting this energy into a usable form
   (electricity or fuels), salinity gradient energy may be able to
   dramatically increase the worlds supply of renewable energy. Here we
   present a novel approach to convert this source of energy directly into
   hydrogen and electricity using Reverse Electrodialysis (RED). RED relies
   on converting ionic current to electric current using multiple membranes
   and redox based electrodes. A thermodynamic model for RED is created to
   evaluate the electricity and hydrogen which can be extracted from
   natural mixing processes. With equal volumes of HC and LC solutions
   (0.001m(3)), the maximum energy extracted is found to occur with 5
   number of membrane pairs. At this operating point, 0.4 kWh/m(3) can be
   extracted as electrical energy and 0.95 kWh/m(3) of energy is extracted
   as hydrogen energy. The electrical energy conversion efficiency
   approaches 15\%, whereas the hydrogen energy efficiency is 35\%.
   Overall, the maximum system conversion of Gibbs free energy to
   electrical and hydrogen energy approaches 50\%. The results show that as
   the number of membrane pairs increases from 5 to 20, the hydrogen power
   density decreases from 13.2 W/m(2) to 3.7 W/m(2). Likewise, the power
   density from electrical energy decreases from 1 W/m(2) to 0.3 W/m(2).
   This is because of increase in the total membrane area as increasing the
   number of membrane pairs. The stack voltage increased from 1.5V to 6V as
   the number of membrane pairs is increased from 5 to 20. This corresponds
   to an increase in internal resistance from 600 Omega.cm2 to 2400
   Omega.cm(2). Long term trade off between improving the system voltage,
   while decreasing the system resistance will be crucial for improved long
   term RED performance. Furthermore, optimum operation of RED, depends on
   proper selection of external resistance. A small external resistance
   will increase hydrogen energy and decrease electrical energy,
   particularly using a small number of membrane pairs. With the fixed
   small external resistance, as increasing the number of membrane pairs,
   the difference between internal and external resistance increases.
   Therefore, the load potential and current density do not increase
   considerably. For the cases analyzed with 8.29 0.cm(2) external
   resistance, the maximum current density increases from 11.1 mA/cm(2) to
   12.4 mA/cm(2) as the number of membrane pairs increases from 5 to 20.
   Likewise, the load potential rises from 92 mV to 102 mV.}},

Abstract = {{A real-time toll that accurately reflects the congestion and delays of a

   extends an existing system-optimal real-time congestion pricing strategy
   by relaxing the assumption of constant capacity, which allows one to
   implement the strategy on a dynamic microsimulation of the HOT lane,
   whose capacity and that of general purpose lanes vary because of the
   weaving activity at the end of the HOT lane. It was found that the
   proposed model was superior in total delay savings, particularly when
   bottleneck capacities varied significantly. A clear linear relationship
   was also found between the pricing coefficient and dimensionless delays
   and the pricing coefficient and revenue. These findings strengthen the
   system optimal linear toll pricing strategy and suggest that departments
   of transportation can implement practical toll systems that incorporate

Abstract = {{Predictive health monitoring of structural components will require the
   development of advanced sensing techniques capable of providing
   quantitative information on the damage state of structural materials. By
   focusing on nonlinear acoustic techniques, it is possible to measure
   absolute, strength based material parameters that can then be coupled
   with uncertainty models to enable accurate and quantitative life
   prediction. Starting at the material level, this paper will examine the
   second harmonic generation (SHG) of Rayleigh surface waves in metals to
   characterize material microstructure. These nonlinear ultrasonic
   measurements can sense material state, before the formation of micro-and
   macro-cracks. Typically, cracks of a measurable size appear quite late
   in a component's total life, while the material's integrity in terms of
   toughness and strength gradually decreases due to the microplasticity
   (dislocations) and associated change in the material's microstructure.
   This paper considers the specific application of the formation of
   chromium carbide precipitates in grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Genome editing is greatly facilitated by using engineered nucleases to
   specifically cleave a pre-selected DNA sequence. Cellular repair of the
   nuclease-induced DNA breaks by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)
   or homology-directed repair (HDR) allows genome editing in a wide range
   of organisms and cell lines. However, if a nuclease cleaves at genomic
   locations other than the intended target, known as ``off-target
   sites{''}, it can lead to mutations, chromosomal loss or rearrangements,
   causing gain/loss of function and cytotoxicity. Although zinc finger
   nucleases (ZFNs), TAL effector nuclease (TALENs), and CRISPR/Cas9
   systems have been used successfully to create specific DNA breaks in
   cells, they lack perfect specificity and may result in off-target
   cleavage. Methods have been developed to predict and to quantify the
   off-target cleavage events, which are very important for optimizing
   nuclease design and determining if the gene editing approaches are
   highly specific. These methods have the potential to significantly
   facilitate the design of engineered nucleases for genome editing
   applications.}},

Pages = {{31-40}},
Abstract = {{Different concepts of health have been applied to transportation and
   other built infrastructure systems in the literature and in practice.
   The 2012 national surface transportation legislation, Moving Ahead for
   Progress in the 21st Century, established a performance-based planning
   framework requiring the development of performance measures and targets
   with progress reporting by state, metropolitan, and local agencies
   toward achieving seven national goals. Although performance-based
   planning offers a formal platform on which to plan systematically to
   achieve goals, one of the key challenges is how best to manage
   transportation system performance in nonuniform metropolitan regions and
   local jurisdictions to achieve uniform statewide and national goals.
   Motivated by this issue, this study developed the concept of
   transportation system health (TSH) with a focus on fulfilling both basic
   needs and beyond-basic needs of the communities that transportation
   systems serve, with Maslow's theory of human motivation as a foundation.
   Potential applications of the TSH framework are discussed, with examples
   highlighting their significance for multiscale and context-sensitive
   planning and decision making. This paper is potentially useful to
   practitioners looking for systematic approaches to support identifying
   strategic goals, determining priorities, selecting performance measures,
   and setting targets in nonuniform regions to achieve uniform statewide
   goals.}},

Title = {{Enhanced Synthetic Population Generator That Accommodates Control
   Variables at Multiple Geographic Resolutions}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2563}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Abstract = {{Microsimulation models that simulate travel demand at the level of
   individual travelers have been gaining increasing interest among
   practitioners. Transportation planning agencies across the country are
   steadily migrating to activity-based microsimulation models, which
   provide considerable flexibility when testing policy scenarios.
   Generating a synthetic population is the first step in the application
   of any activity-based model system and has therefore been a topic of
   extensive research in the activity based modeling arena. Several
   researchers have developed population synthesizers that can generate
   synthetic populations and can match household- and person-level
   constraints at a specified geographic resolution (e.g., a census block
   group). However, although information for some control variables may be
   available at the specified spatial resolution, information for other
   control variables may be available only at a more aggregate spatial
   resolution. Ignoring control variables at different levels of spatial
   resolution could result in the generation of a synthetic population that
   would not be representative of the underlying population. However, there
   has been limited progress in the development of synthetic population
   generators that are capable of accommodating control variables at
   multiple spatial resolutions. This paper proposes a robust approach to
   control for constraints at multiple geographic resolutions when
   generating a synthetic population. The method is an extension of the
   iterative proportional updating algorithm previously proposed and
   implemented by the authors. A case study demonstrating the efficacy of
   the enhanced algorithm is presented.}},

   Modeling Framework}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2563}},
Pages = {{105-113}},
Abstract = {{Universities with large student enrollments often constitute special
   generators and contribute substantially to a region's travel demand.
   Universities are not only large in size but also unique in nature
   because the travel patterns of university students are substantially
   different from those of the general population. Student travel patterns
   are dictated by class schedules, part-time work, and unique living
   arrangements. Despite recognition of the unique travel characteristics
   of university students, there is a dearth of research on the development
   of operational frameworks to model university travel demand. This study
   aims to fill this gap by proposing a comprehensive framework to model
   the travel demand associated with a large university. The framework has
   several unique features that are specific to a university, such as the
   special treatment of intracampus travel and the sensitivity of the
   travel mode to the parking infrastructure on campus. The framework was
   applied to two major (adjacent) universities in the city of Albuquerque,
   New Mexico. The framework was found to perform very well in replicating
   the travel patterns of the university population, classified by
   affiliation (student, faculty, and staff), education level
   (undergraduate or graduate), and living arrangement (on or off campus).
   The implementation of the framework was done in an opensource coding
   platform (Python) to facilitate seamless integration with the existing
   regional travel demand model.}},

   provides motion to a (osteoarthritis or stroke rehab) passive leg in

   The gait synchronization system is integrated with a motorized hip-joint
   with embedded sensors that measure the angular displacements and
   velocities of both hip joints, and the inertia properties of the knee
   joint. Based on the measured joint-angle trajectories, the motorized
   hip-joint lifts the passive leg in sync with the healthy leg during the

   synchronizing the passive hip with the active leg are experimentally
   illustrated. Based on joint-angle and plantar-force measurements, the
   effects of the passive LEE and sensor-guided gait-synchronization on
   human walking were experimentally investigated. Results comparing
   with/without the passive LEE and with/without gait synchronization
   validate the effectiveness of the sensor-guided designs for reducing

   without the need to install external sensors, which are achieved by
   manipulating the current inputs in the EMs with embedded magnetic

Abstract = {{In metal cutting, the ability to model its tool temperature distribution
   is highly desirable as it provides an effective means to monitor the
   tool and workpiece conditions, particularly when machining titanium
   alloy that has a low heat conductivity. Because of the complex cutting
   heat generation, the difficulty to infer the temperature distribution at
   the cutting interface has been well-recognized as a worldwide problem.
   In the context of dry lathe-turning of titanium alloy, this paper
   presents a method that considers both the macro-and micro-scales in the
   reconstruction of the temperature field at the tool insert. In
   micro-scale modeling, a modified constitutive material model for TC4 is
   incorporated in simulating the machining process, which numerically
   obtains the boundary conditions including contact areas and heat flux
   following through the tool-chip interface for the macro-scale
   heat-transfer model. The temperature distribution of the cutting tool
   can then be solved directly from the heat transfer model, which also
   provides a basis for experimental validation using infrared thermal
   imager for temperature measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the needs to develop a sensing method that simultaneously
   characterizes the dynamic behavior and system properties for analyzing
   and controlling a physical system, this paper formulates the harmonic
   response of an eddy-current (EC) sensor using the distributed current
   source (DCS) models to determine the workpiece thickness and
   displacement from the measured magnetic flux density of the induced EC.
   The DCS modeling methods, which base on physically intuitive closed-form
   solutions to derive the response to an input current through an
   electromagnet, do not require time-consuming and complicated meshes
   including the air-space as needed for a finite-element analysis. The
   effectiveness of the closed-form approximation for real-time
   applications has been verified against exact integral solutions and
   finite-element analysis (FEA), which requires less than 1\% of the exact
   integral computation and yet is capable of achieving relatively high
   accuracy of about 2\% maximum error. The models have been applied to
   derive a mapping between experimentally measured harmonic response of
   the induced EC field and the thickness/displacement of a titanium alloy
   workpiece.}},

Abstract = {{Any individual that re-registers an expired domain implicitly inherits
   the residual trust associated with the domain's prior use. We find that
   adversaries can, and do, use malicious re-registration to exploit domain
   ownership changes-undermining the security of both users and systems. In
   fact, we find that many seemingly disparate security problems share a
   root cause in residual domain trust abuse. With this study we shed light
   on the seemingly unnoticed problem of residual domain trust by measuring
   the scope and growth of this abuse over the past six years. During this
   time, we identified 27,758 domains from public blacklists and 238,279
   domains resolved by malware that expired and then were maliciously
   re-registered. To help address this problem, we propose a technical
   remedy and discuss several policy remedies. For the former, we develop
   Alembic, a lightweight algorithm that uses only passive observations
   from the Domain Name System (DNS) to flag potential domain ownership
   changes. We identify several instances of residual trust abuse using
   this algorithm, including an expired APT domain that could be used to
   revive existing infections.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, digital manufacturing systems with real-time process
   monitoring and control are in high demand in industries for productivity
   and quality improvement. During machining, such a system is anticipated
   to excerpt reliable data within a short time-lapse, monitor tool wear
   progress, anticipate its wear and breakage, alert the machinist in real
   time to avoid unexpected failure, and help obtaining quality products.
   This is vital, especially, when drilling Ni-/Ti-based superalloys as
   catastrophic failure and premature breakage of tools occur in random
   manner due to aggressive welding and chipping of the rake and flank
   faces. Spindle power data are easy to collect from modem machine tools
   and can be made available for such real-time data processing. This work
   aims to evaluate and analyze spindle power data for real-time tool
   wear/breakage monitoring during drilling of a Ni-based superalloy,
   Inconel 625. Experiments were performed by varying speed and feed. Power
   data were collected from the power meter (also called load meter) of the
   machine spindle to feed into the neural network (NN) for functional
   processing. As a counterpart, force data were also collected and
   processed to understand the reliability of the spindle power data. The
   results show that the trends of these two different types of data are
   similar for any feed and speed combinations. It is believed that such
   spindle power data integrated with the artificial intelligence (NN)
   system can be used for real-time tool wear/breakage monitoring and
   process control, thus can enhance digital manufacturing systems.}},

Abstract = {{During drilling, long stringy chips resulting from ductile plastic
   deformation of engineering materials cause severe chip clogging within
   the narrow helical flutes and edge chipping, leading to premature tool
   wear and breakage, poor tool life, poor hole quality and the
   productivity. Cutting fluid cannot efficiently access to the cutting
   edge that plays a vital role for improving machining performance. To
   address the localized heat and chip control issues during drilling,
   research was previously performed using conventional flood cooling,
   modified tool geometry, tool coating materials, and internal coolant via
   through hole(s). This works focuses on design and insertion of some
   obstruction-type chip breakers such as ribs and pins on the drill flutes
   and their influence on chip formation behavior. For feasibility
   experiments, small round pins made of stainless steel at a diameter of
   about 0.8-0.85 mm diameter are prepared and attached on the
   electro-discharge machined (EDM) blind holes on twisted drill flutes. By
   varying spindle speed and feed rate, drilling experiments are performed
   on two engineering materials including Al6061 and Inconel 625
   superalloys at four cutting conditions. Most chips are found to be
   broken and some split into two fractions due to the pins. Force and
   power values with pin-inserted drill bits were found to be reduced from
   5-9\%. This finding indicates that there is a good potential to
   implement such obstruction-type chip-breakers on the drill flutes for
   obtaining controllable chip while also improving coolant flow at the
   cutting edge through the tiny tool-chip interface.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical integrity of photovoltaic (PV) silicon wafers is critical
   to avoid failure during solar cell manufacturing. Residual stress
   present in wafers affects mechanical integrity. Residual stresses are
   generated during solidification of ingots and during the wafering or
   wire sawing process used to produce silicon wafers. In this paper, the
   residual maximum shear stress in diamond wire sawn photovoltaic
   multi-crystalline silicon wafers corresponding to different crystal
   growth rates and their pre-and post-etched conditions are analyzed. The
   full-field residual stress distributions in the wafers are measured
   using near infra-red transmission birefringence polariscopy. Results
   show that wafers corresponding to the high crystal growth rate are
   characterized by larger residual maximum shear stress. As the growth
   rate increases to two times the standard growth rate, the average
   residual stress increases by 43\%. The increase in residual stress in
   the high growth rate wafers is attributed to the interaction of
   abrasives with more grain boundaries present in these wafers. Etching
   results in lower residual stress for all growth rates and ingot
   locations.}},

   lack performance dimensions such as energy efficiency. There are
   inherent differences between Urban Design as a model of decision-making

   propose a research design that combines the Urban Design Computational

Abstract = {{Many cities around the world have reached a critical situation when it
   comes to energy and water supply, threatening the urban sustainable
   development. The aim of this paper is to develop a spatial optimization
   model for the planning of residential urban districts with special
   consideration of renewables and water harvesting integration. In
   particular, the paper analyses the optimal configuration of built
   environment area, PV area, wind turbines number and relative occupation
   area, battery and water harvester storage capacities, as a function of
   electricity and water prices. The optimization model is multi-objective
   which uses a genetic algorithm to minimize the system life cycle costs,
   and maximize renewables and water harvesting reliability.
   The developed model can be used for spatial optimization design of new
   urban districts. It can also be employed for analyzing the performances
   of existing urban districts under an energy-water-economic viewpoint.
   Assuming a built environment area equal to 75\% of the total available
   area, the results show that the reliability of the renewables and water
   harvesting system cannot exceed the 6475 and 2500 hours/year,
   respectively. The life cycle costs of integrating renewables and water
   harvesting into residential districts are mainly sensitive to the
   battery system specific costs since most of the highest renewables
   reliabilities are guaranteed through the energy storage system. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Transit agencies are always seeking opportunities to reduce fuel
   consumption, which typically provides simultaneous emissions reductions.
   However, the effectiveness and efficiency of fuel conservation and
   emission reduction alternatives differ as a function of local transit
   operating characteristics. The fact that emissions reductions from
   multiple alternatives are not necessarily additive further complicates
   these analyses. In selecting a set of alternatives, transit agencies
   need to evaluate multiple options simultaneously, and under
   agency-specific operating parameters. This paper presents the analysis
   of emissions reduction alternatives of eco-driving and purchasing new
   fleet with compressed natural gas, utilizing real-world operating data
   collected from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (local
   transit) and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (express bus)
   fleets. Each individual emissions reduction alternative was first
   investigated for effectiveness individually and then in combination to
   assess cumulative impacts. The results show that the comparative
   performance of emissions reductions alternatives is highly dependent on
   vehicle operating characteristics, and thus the preferred alternatives,
   differ between different fleets. The analysis conducted for the Atlanta,
   Georgia region in the United States provides insight to how such
   modeling techniques can assist planning for future fleets given each
   agency's unique local conditions. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient response-based adjoint radiation transport method is
   developed and implemented into the coarse mesh transport (COMET) code.
   The numerical implementation of the adjoint COMET consists of three
   steps: local calculations to compute adjoint response coefficients for
   each unique coarse mesh, global calculations to converge on the core
   eigenvalue and adjoint partial current moments crossing coarse mesh
   boundaries, and local construction of the adjoint flux distribution
   within each coarse mesh. The reciprocity relations between forward and
   adjoint response functions are also derived. This unique property can be
   used to compute adjoint response coefficients without solving the local
   adjoint problems directly. As a result, the computational effort to
   generate adjoint response coefficients is completely avoided. The
   adjoint COMET is tested for two applications: adjoint whole-core
   eigenvalue calculations in the 3D C5G7 benchmark problem, and local
   calculations of adjoint surface-to-volume fission density response
   coefficients for a stylized CANDU benchmark problem. These tests have
   shown that the adjoint COMET method is significantly faster than the
   Monte Carlo method while maintaining accuracy close to that of Monte
   Carlo.}},

Abstract = {{Capturing renewable energy has become an increasingly urgent task due to
   concerns over fossil fuel supplies and accessability in the future.
   Photovoltaic technology represents the most promising strategy to
   address this problem. However to date, no solar cell module has been
   able to satisfy the simultaneous requirements of high efficiency, low
   cost and long lifetime necessary for large scale production and
   application. Recent development in organic-inorganic halide perovskite
   solar cells (PSCs) has shown great potential for large- scale
   application owing to the superb power conversion efficiency (PCE),
   facile device fabrication and low material cost. Since the first report
   of methyl ammonium lead halide, CH3NH3PbX3 ( X = Br, I), sensitized
   liquid solar cells in 2009, the PCEs of PSCs have jumped from 3.8 to
   20.2 \%. Research efforts on new preparation processes and materials
   design for PSCs still remain highly active. This chapter will
   concentrate on summarizing the recently reported nanostructured
   materials (i.e. TiO2, A1(2)O(3), ZnO, carbon materials and others)
   applied in PSCs. This chapter strives to present a comprehensive
   overview and provide a deep understanding of nanostructured materials in

Abstract = {{Understanding how plasmonic nanoparticles collectively generate heat
   upon exposure to light and thus increase the local temperature of the
   surrounding medium is critical for many applications such as
   plasmon-assisted microfluidics, plasmonic tweezers, and photothermal
   cancer therapy. Reliable temperature manipulation requires the
   capability to spatially and dynamically analyze local temperature
   profiles as a function of nanoparticle concentration and laser
   intensity. In this work, we present a novel method for visualization of
   local temperature increase using elastin-like polypeptides (ELP). We
   also propose a robust algorithm that allows the construction of reliable
   calibration curves using known boundary conditions and Boltzmann sigmoid
   fit applied to the ELP solution's temperature-absorption transfer
   function. Using this technique, for the first time, we successfully
   demonstrated how surface and volume distribution of the nano-heaters
   affect collective heat generation. This approach allows the
   visualization of dynamic 2D-temperature profiles and simultaneously
   enables the measurement of specific temperature at any point in a
   2D-map. The experimental setup is compatible with conventional optical

Abstract = {{Software-defined networks (SDNs) have been recognized as the
   next-generation networking paradigm that decouples the data forwarding
   from the centralized control. To realize the merits of dedicated QoS
   provisioning and fast route (re) configuration services over the
   decoupled SDNs, various QoS requirements in packet delay, loss, and
   throughput should be supported by an efficient transportation with
   respect to each specific application. In this paper, a QoS-aware
   adaptive routing (QAR) is proposed in the designed multi-layer
   hierarchical SDNs. Specifically, the distributed hierarchical control
   plane architecture is employed to minimize signaling delay in large SDNs
   via three-levels design of controllers, i.e., the super, domain (or
   master), and slave controllers. Furthermore, QAR algorithm is proposed
   with the aid of reinforcement learning and QoS-aware reward function,
   achieving a time-efficient, adaptive, QoS-provisioning packet
   forwarding. Simulation results confirm that QAR outperforms the existing
   learning solution and provides fast convergence with QoS provisioning,
   facilitating the practical implementations in large-scale software
   service-defined networks.}},

Abstract = {{Local transportation services are an essential component of all modern
   urban infrastructures. The constantly growing requirements and
   expectations from several stakeholders, ranging from public authorities,
   service providers and customers, demand a deep rethinking of the entire
   system. Such services must be oriented towards sustainability and
   everyday living, thus needing significant Quality of Service (QoS)
   improvement in this sector. This paper aims at highlighting the main
   challenges for modeling and implementing the relationships between the
   stakeholders in the public transportation sector and proposes a systemic
   modeling approach that would serve to design, implement, and monitor a
   QoS-regulatory document. A taxonomy of quality indicators and service
   levels are proposed along with metrics on the basis of athe European and
   Italian regulatory background as well as of the public transportation
   service lifecycle model. The proposed approach has been validated by
   developing a service analytics system deployed at the regional

Abstract = {{In this paper, a QoS-aware traffic classification framework for software
   defined networks is proposed. Instead of identifying specific
   applications in most of the previous work of traffic classification, our
   approach classifies the network traffic into different classes according
   to the QoS requirements, which provide the crucial information to enable
   the fine-grained and QoS-aware traffic engineering. The proposed
   framework is fully located in the network controller so that the
   real-time, adaptive, and accurate traffic classification can be realized
   by exploiting the superior computation capacity, the global visibility,
   and the inherent programmability of the network controller. More
   specifically, the proposed framework jointly exploits deep packet
   inspection (DPI) and semi-supervised machine learning so that accurate
   traffic classification can be realized, while requiring minimal
   communications between the network controller and the SDN switches.
   Based on the real Internet data set, the simulation results show the
   proposed classification framework can provide good performance in terms
   of classification accuracy and communication costs.}},

   stereolithographic process in which lens shaped features are fabricated
   from Photopolymer resin. During the fabrication process, a dynamic mask
   is used to control and project radiation patterns through a transparent

   from the substrate surface. We present a novel method to monitor the
   photopolymerization process in real-time with spatial resolution in a
   plane perpendicular to the growth of polymerization. A transparent
   Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) was incorporated into our Interferometric
   Cure Monitoring (ICM) system, an interferometric monitoring system which
   is used to measure the cured part height. The introduction of SLM
   enabled multiple point which could not be achieved by the traditional
   manually operated iris. This improved ICM system fulfilled the need of
   selectively scanning the curing area and estimating the height and width
   of the cured part at a specific region of interest. This
   multiple-point-selective monitoring approach is experimentally validated
   to measure the height at different locations of the cured part in real
   time, and also the lateral dimensions of the cured part at the substrate
   level by a scanning process controlled by the SLM.}},

Abstract = {{Laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM)
   process that enables fabrication of functional metal parts with
   near-net-shape geometries. The drawback to L-PBF is its lack of
   dimensional precision and accuracy. The efficiency of powder fusion
   process in powder bed AM processes is highly affected by process errors,
   powder irregularities as well as geometric factors. Formation of defects
   such as lack of fusion and over-fusion due to the aforementioned factors
   causes dimensional errors that significantly damage the precision.
   This paper addresses the development of an automated in-situ inspection
   system for powder-bed additive manufacturing processes based on machine
   vision. The results of the in-situ automated inspection of dimensional
   accuracy allows for early identification of faulty parts or
   alternatively in-situ correction of geometric errors by taking
   appropriate corrective actions. In this inspection system, 2D optical
   images captured from each layer of the AM part during the build are
   analyzed and the geometric errors and defects impairing the dimensional
   accuracy are detected in each layer. To successfully detect geometric
   errors, fused geometric objects must be detected in the powder layer.
   Image processing algorithms are effectively designed to detect the
   geometric objects from images of low contrast captured during the build
   inside the chamber. The developed algorithms are implemented to a large
   number of test images and their performance and precision are evaluated
   quantitatively. The failure probabilities for the algorithms are also
   determined statistically.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of plug-and-play programmability in conventional toolpath
   planning approach in subtractive manufacturing, i.e., machining leads to
   significantly higher manufacturing cost for CNC based prototyping. In
   computer aided manufacturing (CAM) packages, typical B-rep or NURBS
   based representations of the CAD interfaces challenge core computations
   of tool trajectories generation process, such as, surface offsetting to
   be completely automated. In this work the problem of efficient
   generation of free-form surface offsets is addressed with a novel
   volumetric representation. It presents an image filter based offsetting
   algorithm, which leverages the parallel computing engines on modern
   graphics processor unit (GPU). The scalable voxel data structure and the
   proposed hardware-accelerated volumetric offsetting together advance the
   computation and memory efficiencies well beyond the capability of past
   studies. Additionally, in order to further accelerate the offset
   computation the problem of offsetting with a large distance is
   decomposed into successive offsetting using smaller distances. The
   accuracy of the offset algorithms is thoroughly analyzed. The developed
   GPU implementation of the offsetting algorithm is robust in computation,
   easy to comprehend, and achieves a 50-fold speedup on single graphics
   card (NVIDIA GTX780Ti) relative to prior best-performing dual socket
   quad-core CPU implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, both small-and medium-sized manufacturers as
   well as large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been faced
   with an increasing need for low cost and scalable intelligent
   manufacturing machines. Capabilities are needed for collecting and
   processing large volumes of real-time data generated from manufacturing
   machines and processes as well as for diagnosing the root cause of
   identified defects, predicting their progression, and forecasting
   maintenance actions proactively to minimize unexpected machine down
   times. Although cloud computing enables ubiquitous and instant remote
   access to scalable information and communication technology (ICT)
   infrastructures and high volume data storage, it has limitations in
   latency-sensitive applications such as high performance computing and
   real-time stream analytics. The emergence of fog computing, Internet of
   Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent radical changes
   in the way sensing systems, along with ICT infrastructures, collect and
   analyze large volumes of real-time data streams in geographically
   distributed environments. Ultimately, such technological approaches
   enable machines to function as an agent that is capable of intelligent
   behaviors such as automatic fault and failure detection, self-diagnosis,
   and preventative maintenance scheduling. The objective of this research
   is to introduce a fog enabled architecture that consists of smart sensor
   networks, communication protocols, parallel machine learning software,
   and private and public clouds. The fog-enabled architecture will have
   the potential to enable large-scale, geographically distributed online
   machine and process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis that require
   low latency and high bandwidth in the context of data-driven
   cyber-manufacturing systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, both software model visualization with path simulation
   and associated machining product are produced based on the step ring
   based 3-axis path planning to demo model-driven graphics processing unit
   (GPU) feature in tool path planning and 3D image model classification by
   GPU simulation. Subtractive 3D printing (i.e., 3D machining) is
   represented as integration between 3D printing modeling and CNC
   machining via GPU simulated software. Path planning is applied through
   material surface removal visualization in high resolution and 3D path
   simulation via ring selective path planning based on accessibility of
   path through pattern selection. First, the step ring selects critical
   features to reconstruct computer aided design (CAD) design model as STL
   (stereolithography) voxel, and then local optimization is attained
   within interested ring area for time and energy saving of GPU volume
   generation as compared to global all automatic path planning with longer
   latency. The reconstructed CAD model comes from an original sample
   (GATech buzz) with 2D image information. CAD model for optimization and
   validation is adopted to sustain manufacturing reproduction based on
   system simulation feedback. To avoid collision with the produced path
   from retraction path, we pick adaptive ring path generation and
   prediction in each planning iteration, which may also minimise material
   removal. Moreover, we did partition analysis and g-code optimization for
   large scale model and high density volume data. Image classification and
   grid analysis based on adaptive 3D tree depth are proposed for
   multi-level set partition of the model to define no cutting zones. After
   that, accessibility map is computed based on accessibility space for
   rotational angular space of path orientation to compare step ring based
   pass planning verses global all path planning. Feature analysis via
   central processing unit (CPU) or GPU processor for GPU map computation
   contributes to high performance computing and cloud computing potential
   through parallel computing application of subtractive 3D printing in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a hybrid Random Forest-Genetic Algorithm approach to
   detect and solve bottleneck machine problems in parallel machine
   Job-shop scheduling is developed with the aim of minimizing the makespan
   and the additional cost. The drawbacks of the existing methods for
   diagnosing bottlenecks is that they either do not consider the severity
   of the bottleneck or they do not consider the existence of multiple
   bottlenecks. In the existing models for solving bottlenecks, the cost is
   not considered as an objective function and only shifting of bottlenecks
   is utilized to solve the bottleneck machine problem. This approach is
   not feasible if the maximum capacity of the workshop has been reached.
   In this paper, a Random Forest classification model is utilized to
   diagnose bottleneck machine with different severity where the severity
   of the machines on the shop floor can either be none, low, medium, or
   high. Due to the lack of historical data, the Random Forest algorithm is
   trained using bottleneck data generated by simulating several identical
   parallel machine Job-shop scheduling problems. The trained Random Forest
   algorithm is then used in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm for finding
   the optimal actions to be taken for the most severe bottlenecks machines
   in order to reduce the makespan and the additional cost by optimizing
   the number of additional parallel machines to be utilized and overtime
   hours for the most severe bottleneck machines. The two objectives,
   makespan and additional cost, are combined into a single objective value
   by the use of weight values. These weight values depend on severity of
   the most severe bottleneck machine. If the bottleneck severity is
   ``high{''} then makespan has a higher weight value than cost, if the
   severity is ``medium{''} then both cost and makespan are weighed
   equally, and if the severity is ``low{''} then cost has a higher weight
   value than makespan. In order to show the validity of the proposed
   approach it is used for diagnosing and solving the bottleneck problems
   in three different identical parallel machine Job-shop scheduling case
   studies 1. 3 jobs with 6 machines 2. 5 jobs with 9 machines and 3. 5
   jobs with 12 machines. By utilizing the proposed approach the makespan
   and cost were reduced by 19.0\%, 24.5\% and 25.4\% in case studies 1, 2,
   and 3 respectively. The results show that the trained Random Forest
   algorithm was able to correctly diagnose the bottleneck machines and
   their severity and Genetic algorithm was able to find the optimal number
   of additional hours and additional machines for the most severe
   bottleneck machines on the shop floor.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its recent popularity, additive manufacturing (AM) still faces
   many technical challenges for the insufficiency of process reliability,
   controllability, and product quality. To enhance the process
   repeatability, effective in-situ monitoring methods for AM processes are
   needed. In this study, an online monitoring method for AM process
   failure detection is proposed, where acoustic emission (AE) is applied
   as the sensing technique. Its application to polymer material extrusion,
   also known as the technology of fused deposition modeling (FDM), is
   demonstrated. Experimental results show that the proposed monitoring
   method allows for the real time identification of major process
   failures. The occurring time of major failures and failure modes can be
   identified by analyzing the time- and frequency-domain features of AE
   hits respectively. A K-means clustering algorithm is applied to verify
   and demonstrate the classification procedure. The automated failure
   identification can reduce the waste of fabrication with enhanced machine
   intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{Most modern cyber crime leverages the Domain Name System (DNS) to attain
   high levels of network agility and make detection of Internet abuse
   challenging. The majority of malware, which represent a key component of
   illicit Internet operations, are programmed to locate the IP address of
   their command-and-control (C\&C) server through DNS lookups. To make the
   malicious infrastructure both agile and resilient, malware authors often
   use sophisticated communication methods that utilize DNS (i.e., domain
   generation algorithms) for their campaigns. In general, Internet
   miscreants make extensive use of short-lived disposable domains to
   promote a large variety of threats and support their criminal network
   operations.
   To effectively combat Internet abuse, the security community needs
   access to freely available and open datasets. Such datasets will enable
   the development of new algorithms that can enable the early detection,
   tracking, and overall lifetime of modern Internet threats. To that end,
   we have created a system, Thales, that actively queries and collects
   records for massive amounts of domain names from various seeds. These
   seeds are collected from multiple public sources and, therefore, free of
   privacy concerns. The results of this effort will be opened and made
   freely available to the research community. With three case studies we
   demonstrate the detection merit that the collected active DNS datasets
   contain. We show that (i) more than 75\% of the domain names in public
   black lists (PBLs) appear in our datasets several weeks (and some cases
   months) in advance, (ii) existing DNS research can be implemented using
   only active DNS, and (iii) malicious campaigns can be identified with
   the signal provided by active DNS.}},

Abstract = {{A novel internetworking paradigm, software-defined exchange (SDX),
   allows multiple independent administrative domains to share computing,
   storage, and networking resources. Although the term SDX is very recent,
   the concept has already been used by many distinct disciplines. For
   example, cloud-computing researchers use it to add network
   virtualization resources to their inter-clouds, while networking
   researchers use it to insert SDN technologies into the networking
   exchange infrastructure. Despite the different uses, the efforts of the
   various disciplines that share networking resources converge to a single
   poing enabled by the virtualization and the separation of control and
   data planes. This paper presents a survey of the most relevant SDX
   studies from various research areas, focusing on their architectures.
   The paper defines a taxonomy for the SDX, provides generalized
   architecture models, and concludes by presenting a qualitative analysis
   of the architectures that focuses on the scalability, resilience,
   peering technologies, and deployment of SDX.}},

Abstract = {{Insider threats are a growing concern for industry, government, and
   campus networks. Yet, vulnerabilities inherent in Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) are exploitable by insiders seeking to launch
   sophisticated attacks on local area networks (LANs). Such attacks,
   initialized through ARP spoofing, include denial of service, server
   redirect, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Unfortunately, the current
   state of the art technologies for detecting and preventing ARP poisoning
   are tediously complex, slow to detect, and difficult to maintain.
   However, software defined networking (SDN) enables the implementation of
   novel security measures that are capable of detecting and eliminating
   ARP spoofing before it can impact other hosts. Hence, this paper
   presents Network Flow Guard for ARP (NFGA), an SDN security module that
   augments simple, MAC-learning, protocols on OpenFlow-enabled switches.
   NFG works by hashing a host's physical address with an appropriate IP:
   port association to deny ARP spoofing at real-time. Moreover, our
   framework's key contribution is that it achieves ARP security with
   minimal intervention by network operators while supporting both dynamic
   and static port allocations, requiring no changes to the network's
   topology or protocols, and requiring no client software installation.}},

   Compliance Using Three-Dimensional Mobile Lidar}},

Abstract = {{The sidewalk is an indispensable infrastructure for pedestrians,
   especially wheelchair users. Wheelchair users rely on quality sidewalks
   to facilitate safe and uninterrupted trips in their everyday lives.
   Transportation agencies are required to evaluate regulatory compliance
   with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and are responsible for
   the timely maintenance of inadequate sidewalks. However, these timely
   evaluation and maintenance activities are usually lacking because of the
   labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive data collection process in the
   current practice. There is an urgent need for an efficient and reliable
   method for assessment of sidewalk compliance with the ADA. This paper
   aims to address such a need by proposing an automated sidewalk
   assessment method using three-dimensional mobile light detection and
   ranging (lidar) and image processing. The presence of sidewalks and curb
   ramps is first extracted by use of a video log image and a lidar point
   cloud. Then, the corresponding key features regulated by the ADA,
   including the sidewalk width, cross slope, and grade and the curb ramp
   slope, are automatically measured. By comparison with the manual ground
   truth from a field survey, the experimental tests conducted on the
   Georgia Institute of Technology campus at Atlanta, Georgia, showed
   accurate measurement results for the key features of the sidewalk and
   curb ramps. A case study was then conducted to demonstrate that the
   proposed method could provide transportation agencies a convenient and
   cost-effective means of assessment of compliance with the ADA by
   integration of accurately extracted sidewalk location and measurement
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Systems that involve a tight integration of models of physical entities
   (such as their dynamics), algorithms for controlling them, and
   computational platforms for implementing these algorithms, are referred
   to as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Traditionally, control theory or the
   development of control algorithms, and hardware/software techniques for
   implementing these algorithms were studied and developed independently
   by disjoint communities control theorists on one hand, and embedded
   systems and software engineers on the other hand. But as embedded
   platforms become more complex and distributed, this isolated development
   of the two areas-control algorithm design and control algorithm
   implementation-is leading to significant integration, testing and
   debugging costs. This is because assumptions made during the design
   phase-like negligible time needed to compute the control law,
   zero-delays between the sensors and controllers and controllers and
   actuators, availability of infinite numerical precision when computing
   control inputs, etc. -do not hold during the implementation phase. This
   leads to a deviation in the expected control performance at the design
   phase, and what is realized after implementation. In order to address
   this, CPS-oriented design methods involve a co-design of the control
   algorithms and hardware/software platforms for implementing these
   algorithms. Towards this, this tutorial will discuss cross-layer
   techniques for designing embedded control systems. These layers include
   control models to code synthesis, and code to implementations on
   distributed architectures where we will talk about computation,
   communication and memory-aware design of control systems. Finally, the
   tutorial will also discuss how reliability issues of modern
   semiconductor devices may be accounted for during the control design
   phase. Such a cross-layer design-starting from models of physical
   systems, to software, to architecture, and finally to reliability of
   circuits and devices-will result in certifiable and trustworthy
   cyber-physical systems for which end-to-end guarantees may be offered.
   The application domains where these techniques may be applied are varied
   and range over automotive, avionics, industrial automation, and medical
   technology.
   Currently there is a tremendous amount of interest in cyber-physical
   systems. However, this is an interdisciplinary topic involving the
   intersection of control theory, communications, embedded systems, and
   embedded software. This tutorial will introduce to an audience with a
   primarily embedded systems background the opportunities that exist at
   the intersection of control theory and embedded systems \&
   software-which constitutes the core of cyber-physical systems. Since we
   will cover all the layers of the design stack-from high-level models, to
   software, architecture, and then circuits and devices-the tutorial will
   also highlight verification challenges at all these layers, along with
   how modeling and analysis techniques from each of these layers may be
   composed to built certifiable and trustworthy systems. The tutorial will
   provide enough background to researchers and doctoral candidates-who are
   new to the topic of CPS-to be able to start exploring problems in this
   domain. It will also provide a variety of examples that will help
   practitioners from the industry.}},

Abstract = {{In production testing of analog/RF ICs, application of standard
   specification-based tests for IC classification is not always an
   attractive option due to the high costs and test times involved. In this
   paper, a new test generation algorithm for IC classification is first
   developed that has the property that the corresponding DUT response
   signatures for devices from diverse process corners are maximally
   separable. In other words, the process space can be partitioned into a
   maximally large number of partitions and each tested IC can be uniquely
   diagnosed to lie in one such partition from its response to the applied
   test stimulus. Booleanized representations of analog/RF circuits are
   used to facilitate rapid test stimulus generation. Next, the responses
   of ICs tested in production to the applied classification test are used
   to adaptively classify the ICs into clusters of ``good{''}, ``bad{''}
   and ``marginal{''} devices ( TRAP). This is done through the use of
   probabilistic neural networks that do not require complete network
   retraining every time an IC with different input-output behavior is
   observed. The classification test applied helps in determining if a new
   device being tested is from a different process corner than encountered
   before, thereby aiding IC classification. Simulation experiments show
   that the learning process is rapid and minimizes device
   misclassification with significant savings in test time.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional DRAM stacking has emerged as a vehicle for scaling
   system densities and performance improvement. The two design choices for
   interfacing to processors are -i) a separate core die connected to the
   DRAM stack via a silicon interposer (2.5D), and ii) DRAM die stacked on
   top of the core die (3D). These alternatives have different performance,
   power, and reliability behaviors. Specifically, 3D designs realize
   higher performance but operate at higher temperatures and thus exhibit
   lower lifetime. On the other hand, 2.5D designs provide lower bandwidth
   between the core die and the DRAM stack, but exhibit significantly
   longer lifetime due to less thermally-induced degradation. This paper
   explores this tradeoff between reliability and performance of 3D and
   2.5D stacked memory systems. Our results indicate that, in general,
   lower voltage and frequency operations with 3D stacked systems may
   achieve balanced reliability-performance tradeoff.}},

   technique, can increase system density but at the cost of increased
   thermal and power density, leading to thermal-related problems. Design
   of three-dimensional integrated circuits and systems requires
   considerations of temperature and gradients observed across the die,
   because temperature gradients can vary the delay of clock paths. As we
   need to analyze a large number of parameters for thermal-electrical
   design, optimization of those parameters becomes important for achieving
   efficiency and accuracy. Machine learning methods have been applied in

Abstract = {{Operating distribution systems with a growing number of distributed
   energy resources requires accurate feeder models down to the point of
   interconnection. Many of the new resources are located in the secondary
   low-voltage distribution circuits that typically are not modeled or
   modeled with low level of detail. This paper presents a practical and
   computational efficient approach for estimating the secondary circuit
   topologies from historical voltage and power measurement data provided
   by smart meters and distributed energy resource sensors. The accuracy of
   the algorithm is demonstrated on a 66-node test circuit utilizing real
   AMI data. The algorithm is also utilized to estimate the secondary
   circuit topologies of the Georgia Tech distribution system. Challenges
   and practical implementation approaches of the algorithm are discussed.
   The paper demonstrates the computational infeasibility of exhaustive
   secondary circuit topology estimation approaches and presents an
   efficient algorithm for verifying whether two radial secondary circuits
   have identical topologies.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) modules are quite different from
   traditional power generation sources. For traditional generation
   sources, such as the fossil fuel generators, the current magnitude
   increases drastically when short circuited. This drastic current
   magnitude increase is not the case with PV modules. The short circuit
   current of the PV module could be as low as 105 to 110\% of its maximum
   power point current. Furthermore, most PV systems have a blocking diode
   which prevents the back-feed of current from the power grid to the PV
   array system. Therefore, if a fault occurs within the PV array, the
   series fuse, a common protective device in the PV industry, may not
   operate. The fuse may not operate because the current through the fuse
   is limited by the blocking diode. This low current magnitude makes the
   identification of fault conditions in the PV array even more
   challenging. To further complicate the challenge, the current generated
   by the PV array is solar irradiance dependent. Therefore, on a very
   cloudy day, the fault current magnitude will be a lot less compared to a
   non-cloudy day, with all other conditions being the same. Also, it is
   possible that the current magnitude at one operating condition be the
   same magnitude as a short circuit condition at another operating
   condition. In this paper, a dynamic state estimation-based algorithm for
   detecting various fault conditions within the PV array is presented. It
   is demonstrated that various fault conditions within the PV array system
   are reliably identified using the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Before the rapid growth of wind power, most bulk power system
   uncertainties came from system contingencies and load fluctuation.
   However, when large numbers of wind farms are introduced, the stochastic
   nature of the wind farm output under system normal state calls for a new
   probabilistic framework for system operation and evaluation, which
   captures the uncertainty of wind and corresponding transfer constraints
   of the system. Total transfer capability (TTC) is a measurement of the
   system's maximum power transfer capacity from a set of source buses to a
   set of sink buses. In this paper, we propose a fast probabilistic TTC
   evaluation method that incorporates the less predictable nature of wind
   farms. The proposed method returns the probabilistic TTC as a random
   variable that follows a certain distribution derived from wind farm
   output distributions using power transfer distribution factors. Our
   proposed method solves the probabilistic TTC in an analytic way. Results
   from the IEEE 118-bus test case demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy
   of the proposed method.}},

   affected by local and long-range transported emissions as portrayed by
   the external mixing of the particles, as the larger ones appear to be
   more hygroscopic and more CCN-active than smaller ones. Activation
   fractions at all supersaturations exhibit a diurnal variability with
   minimum values around noon, which are considerably lower than unity.
   This reinforces the conclusion that the aerosol is mostly externally

Abstract = {{With knowledge of a space object's orbit, the matched filter is an image
   processing technique which allows low signal-to-noise ratio objects to
   be detected. Many space situational awareness research efforts have
   looked at ways to characterize the probability density function of a
   partially understood space object. When prior knowledge is only
   constrained to a probability density function, many matched filter
   templates could be representative of the space object, necessitating a
   bank of matched filters. This paper develops the measurement
   dissimilarity metric which is then applied to partition a general prior
   set of orbits. A method for hypothesis testing the result of a matched
   filter for a space object is developed. Finally, a framework for orbit
   determination based on the matched filter result is developed.
   Simulation shows that the analytic results enable more efficient
   computation and a better framework for implementing matched filters.}},

   A multivariate PDF may be transformed and expressed in an alternate

   transformation method to an admissible region to develop the conditions
   required for such a transformation. Because the probability must be
   preserved, it is shown that in general an admissible region PDF may not
   be transformed by a nonlinear transformation unless specific mapping
   conditions are met over all the state space volume. If this condition is
   not met then the transformation of an admissible region PDF yields
   incorrect probabilities over the state space. Further, it is also shown
   that if each state in an admissible region is locally observable then

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of signal of opportunity based
   multilateration to generate initial orbit estimates. Using at least 4
   observer stations, the time differential of arrival of signals of
   opportunity can be measured and used to determine a 3D position estimate
   of the source of the signal with some associated covariance on the
   position estimate. While this solution gives the position of the object,
   admissible region theory may be applied to bound the possible velocity
   states belonging to a particular source. Two constraints are considered
   and analytically derived for the time differential of arrival problem to
   constraint the possible velocity solutions for a given position
   estimate. Once a joint admissible region is formed from these
   constraints, it may be sampled and used as an initial distribution for a
   particle filter. This work shows an example application of particle
   filter initiation with a time differential of arrival measurement based

Abstract = {{For many satellite remote sensing and communications applications,
   particularly those involving a formation or constellation of satellites,
   having precise knowledge of the satellite's position in both an absolute
   and relative sense is essential. With this in mind, this study examines
   potential gains in precise orbit determination (POD) when additional
   intersatellite range observations are combined with standard Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations. The methodology behind
   the combination approach is described and illustrated through a series
   of simulated case studies involving two or more satellites in low Earth
   orbit, using realistic assumptions on measurement noise. The results
   suggest that substantial improvements in the POD for all satellites in
   the constellation can be obtained with even intermittent ranging
   measurements. hi addition, the precision of the intersatellite ranging
   measurements were limited to 1 mm or higher, with additional constraints
   on the intersatellite range distance, to represent levels possible from
   a nanosatelilte (cubesat) platform. By improving the positioning
   capabilities of cubesat constellations, new Earth observing missions
   utilizing cube satellite constellation architectures will become

Title = {{Speciation analysis of silver sulfide nanoparticles in environmental
   waters by magnetic solid-phase extraction coupled with ICP-MS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{The growing production and widespread application of silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) have led to their release into the environment,
   where they are mostly transformed to silver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag2S
   NPs). Thus, speciation analysis of Ag2S NPs in environmental matrices is
   essential for understanding the environmental process and toxic effects
   of AgNPs. Herein, we report the use of aged iron oxide magnetic
   particles (IOMPs) as magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbents for
   speciation analysis of Ag2S NPs. It was found that IOMPs are excellent
   adsorbents for the selective extraction of silver-containing
   nanoparticles (AgCNPs) including Ag2S NPs, AgNPs and AgCl NPs in the
   presence of Ag+. More importantly, Ag2S NPs can be distinguished from
   the other AgCNPs by sequential elution. After pre-eluting AgNPs and AgCl
   NPs as Ag+ with 2\% (v/v) acetic acid and IOMPs as the sacrificial
   oxidants, Ag2S NPs were completely eluted as a Ag(I) complex by 10 mM
   thiourea in 2\% (v/v) acetic acid and quantified directly by inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). While the extraction of Ag+
   was negligible, the maximum extraction of AgCNPs by IOMPs was attained
   at pH 4.9-6.2, and the interference of humic acid in the AgCNP
   extraction can be efficiently eliminated by adding Ca2+. Under optimized
   conditions, the method provides low detection limit (0.068 mg L-1) and
   high reproducibility (relative standard deviations <5.1\%) for Ag2S NPs.
   By simultaneously spiking 0.16-10.3 mg L-1 AgNPs and 0.53-14.8 mg L-1
   Ag2S NPs, the Ag2S NP recoveries were in the range of 69.6-100.2\% for
   the tap, river and lake waters; and in the range of 106.2-149.9\% for
   the WWTP effluent due to the part sulfidation of AgNPs to Ag2S NPs. Our
   method is valid for the speciation analysis of Ag2S NPs in water
   samples, which provides an efficient approach for studying the
   sulfidation of AgNPs and Ag+.}},

Abstract = {{Anion conductive polymers are of value in anion exchange membrane (AEM)
   fuel cells. A series anion conductive polymers composed of partially
   fluorinated multiblock copoly(arylene ether) s (mPEs) with long
   head-group tethers were synthesized via polycondensation and
   Friedel-Crafts reaction. The relationship between chemical structure,
   membrane morphology and physical properties was explored by varying the
   length of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks and the number of
   tethers per hydrophilic repeat unit in the synthesized multiblock
   copolymers. Efficient, ion-conductive nanochannels were formed by using
   nanophase-separation of the multiblock copolymer to improve channel
   formation and ionic conductivity without inducing excess water uptake
   (WU). The hydrophobicity of the partially fluorinated backbone further
   reduced the WU. Doubling the number of head-groups resulted in more than
   doubling the hydroxide ion conductivity. From the study of the number of
   freezable and bound water molecules per head-group, it was found that
   bound water played a dominant role in ion transport, while excess
   unbound water led to higher unproductive WU. Multiblock copolymer AEMs
   with high hydroxide conductivity, up to 119 mS cm(-1) were obtained.
   Polymers with an attractive OH- conductivity of 94 mS cm(-1) at 80
   degrees C, and low WU of 26.7\% with a modest ion exchange capacity were
   also obtained. The membranes showed excellent alkaline stability due to
   the use of the long head-group tether structure and partial
   fluorination. Less than 1.5\% conductivity loss was observed after
   soaking the membrane in 1 M NaOH solution at 60 degrees C for over 1000
   h. Membranes with higher ionic conductivity showed lower oxygen
   diffusivity and permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to describe the in-seat movement and
   weight-shifting behavior of full-time wheelchair users. We measured
   everyday sitting behavior for 192 d across 28 individuals who used
   manual wheelchairs as their primary mobility device. To obtain the
   measurements, we used eight thin force sensors placed under
   participants' wheel-chair cushions. On a typical day, participants spent
   an average of 10.6 +/- 3.0 h in their wheelchair and transferred out of
   the wheelchair 8.4 +/- 4.3 times. Participants only performed pressure
   reliefs (90\% off-loading of the entire buttocks for at least 15 s) 0.4
   +/- 0.5 times per hour they were seated in the chair, but they performed
   weight shifts (WSs) (30\%-90\% off-loading of at least one side of the
   buttocks for 15 s) with a frequency of 2.4 +/- 2.2 times per hour.
   Despite the higher frequency of WSs, they were not performed in a
   routine manner. Half of the days studied included one segment of upright
   sitting lasting at least 2 h without a WS. Given these observations, we
   conclude that seating evaluations should emphasize positioning
   individuals in a way that facilitates reaching, leaning, and
   transferring in a safe manner, not only to improve function but also to
   affect buttocks loading.}},

Abstract = {{Aortic valve (AV) disease is a significant cause of morbidity and
   mortality. The preferred treatment modality for severe AV disease is
   surgical resection and replacement of the native valve with either a
   mechanical or tissue prosthetic. In order to develop effective and
   long-lasting treatment methods, computational analyses, e.g., structural
   finite element (FE) and computational fluid dynamic simulations, are
   very effective for studying valve biomechanics. These computational
   analyses are based on mesh models of the aortic valve, which are usually
   constructed from 3D CT images though many hours of manual annotation,
   and therefore an automatic valve shape reconstruction method is desired.
   In this paper, we present a method for estimating the aortic valve shape
   from 3D cardiac CT images, which is represented by triangle meshes. We
   propose a pipeline for aortic valve shape estimation which includes
   novel algorithms for building local shape dictionaries and for building
   landmark detectors and curve detectors using local shape dictionaries.
   The method is evaluated on real patient image dataset using a
   leave-one-out approach and achieves an average accuracy of 0.69 mm. The
   work will facilitate automatic patient-specific computational modeling
   of the aortic valve.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate segmentation on CT images is a challenging task. In this paper,
   we explore the population and patient-specific characteristics for the
   segmentation of the prostate on CT images. Because population learning
   does not consider the inter-patient variations and because
   patient-specific learning may not perform well for different patients,
   we are combining the population and patient-specific information to
   improve segmentation performance. Specifically, we train a population
   model based on the population data and train a patient-specific model
   based on the manual segmentation on three slice of the new patient. We
   compute the similarity between the two models to explore the influence
   of applicable population knowledge on the specific patient. By combining
   the patient-specific knowledge with the influence, we can capture the
   population and patient-specific characteristics to calculate the
   probability of a pixel belonging to the prostate. Finally, we smooth the
   prostate surface according to the prostate-density value of the pixels
   in the distance transform image. We conducted the leave-one-out
   validation experiments on a set of CT volumes from 15 patients. Manual
   segmentation results from a radiologist serve as the gold standard for
   the evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieved an
   average DSC of 85.1\% as compared to the manual segmentation gold
   standard. This method outperformed the population learning method and
   the patient-specific learning approach alone. The CT segmentation method
   can have various applications in prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution poles support the overhead distribution equipment such as
   overhead line conductors, pole mounted transformers, pole mounted
   capacitors, switches, etc. Falling trees, wind, flying debris and fault
   current forces due to extreme weather cause electrical faults and can
   knock down distribution poles resulting in power outages, system damage
   and millions of dollars in replacement costs. The objective of this
   paper is to demonstrate a model for assessing the probability of
   failures of distribution poles versus weather parameters. The failure of
   a pole can be determined from two factors: (1) The stress on the pole
   and (2) the withstand capability (strength) of the pole. The stress
   depends on a very large set of parameters and it is a complex
   computational task. The challenge is to develop a model that will
   provide the stress on a pole as a function of all pertinent parameters
   that affect pole stress. The strength of the pole depends on the type of
   pole (material, size), installation type, and age/deterioration of pole.
   Through this model, the vulnerable areas and breakage points of the
   distribution network can be predicted by developing and quantifying an
   analytical model of the Distribution System. By doing so, the
   bottlenecks in Distribution Systems can be studied and reliability and
   resilience of the system can be analyzed. This analysis forms the
   foundation for developing Outage Prediction and Management Systems which
   is necessary for hardening the distribution network and increasing its
   resiliency during severe weather situations.}},

Abstract = {{In short-circuit studies, phase shifts in transformers (e.g., connected
   in wye-delta or vice versa) make difficult to calculate fault current
   flowing in sequence-component networks. Therefore, they are often
   ignored because the magnitude of fault current is much more of interest
   than phase angles from the protection point of view (e.g., overcurrent
   relays). As high capacity distributed generation (DG) resources are
   being deployed into distribution networks, they may change the direction
   and the phase angle of fault current and cause abnormal operations of
   directional or distance relays. Thus, the objective of this paper is to
   develop a short-circuit analysis algorithm able to (a) calculate changes
   in phase shifts caused by transformers in sequence networks with
   high-capacity DG sources and (b) analyze the effect of not only various
   capacities (e.g., 10, 30, and 50 percent) of DG resources but also
   various locations of faults on current that flows during a short
   circuit. To verify the developed algorithm, using MATLAB, case studies
   that generate a single line-to-ground fault on (a) the high- and
   low-voltage sides and (b) a weakly meshed network are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Many types of fault current limiters (FCLs) have been designed and
   implemented in transmission and subtransmission levels of the grid,
   among which the resonant type FCL has captured more attention due to its
   simple, yet efficient, functionality. Parallel-type resonant FCLs
   (PRFCLs) could reduce the fault current effectively with only the
   reactive part of impedance, rather than the resistance; this could be
   considered as both a merit and a drawback. In this paper, the
   performance and functionality of different designs of PRFCLs are
   addressed to find the best method of current limitation with minimum
   side effects like voltage sag, harmonics, etc. Performance analysis for
   various PRFCLs is conducted using SIMULINK/MATLAB software. Simulation
   results show the efficiency of a PRFCL in reducing the fault current by
   changing only its reactance.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial EM software packages are not suitable to detect cardiac and

   utilized phantom models. The tissue constitutive parameters are time
   dependent, and are strong function of the volume and physical
   composition of the tissue layers near the surface due to the associated
   physiological motion. In this paper, we consider a human body phantom
   model that includes physiological motion, and a state-space method to
   extract cardiac and respiration rates. The method is applied to
   simulated data as well as 3 GHz UWB radar measurements on a sedentary
   subject. It is shown that the state-space method accurately estimates
   vital signs without producing harmonics and inter-modulation products
   that plague signal resolution in commonly used auto-correlated FFT
   spectrograms relying on peak detection with errors less than 2\%.}},

   Specifically, Alice transmits codewords of length n and chooses the
   transmission epoch T uniformly at random among N available time epochs,
   where N >> n. This deliberate symbol level-asynchronism forces the
   adversary to monitor a window of size N' much larger than the codeword
   length n, and results in an increased covert throughput compared to the
   scenario without asynchronism. Our result generalizes a previous work in

   that a high-quality 4-element array factor is successfully synthesized
   for the input progressive phase shift from -120 degrees to +120 degrees.
   At an input power P-in of -17dBm/element, the normalized array factor is
   -4.3dB/-3.2dB at +90 degrees/-90 degrees input progressive phase shift
   in the closed-loop operation, out-performing reported active
   self-steering beam-formers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first demonstration of an all-passive network for front-end
   self-steering beam-forming with zero DC power.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design of a novel educational virtual reality application
   to aid undergraduate engineering students in understanding the basic
   principles of fluid mechanics. The application was deployed on a tablet
   computer, and we compared two 3D user-interfaces, which differed
   primarily by locomotion technique. The first technique employed
   multi-touch gestures. The second technique used a mobile-tracked
   display. We conducted a pilot study with 23 participants, divided into
   two groups according to user-interface type. We restricted participants
   to undergraduate engineering students in an engineering statics course
   that were familiar with free-body diagrams of distributed loads but had
   not been taught the principles of fluid mechanics. Participants answered
   applied visual reasoning questions and theoretical questions, while they
   interacted with the application. Our results indicate that a
   mobile-tracked display is a usable, engaging approach, but results were
   unclear with respect to learning.}},

Abstract = {{We present an energy harvesting system comprising a dual purpose CMOS

   captures image and is reconfigured to form an on-chip photovoltaic cell
   to harvest energy. It generates 2.1)tW peak power at 300mV with 200klux
   illuminance. The generated voltage is used as the input of the switching
   energy extractor that boosts the voltage up to 3.3V and stores the
   energy in the storage element (battery/super capacitor). The stored
   energy is then supplied to the load at three independent domains using
   the single inductor multi-output (SIMO) buck regulator. Both the SIMO
   buck and the energy-harvesting boost use the only inductor in the system
   through internally managed time multiplexing mechanism. This prototype
   demonstrates a solution for low frame rate, energy autonomous imaging

Abstract = {{Development of materials with fine spatial control over topographical,

   polyelectrolyte constructs including two-dimensionally and
   three-dimensionally patterned assemblies using both compressible and
   incompressible colloidal building blocks. This method eliminates prior
   constraints associated with specific chemistries, and can be used to
   develop modular, multi-component, patterned assemblies. In particular,
   development of constructs were investigated using microgels, which are
   colloidally stable hydrogel microparticles, polystyrene (PS) beads, and
   PS-microgel core-shell building blocks in conjunction with the
   polycation poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The topography, mechanical
   properties, and microstructure of these materials were characterized via
   bright field microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy, atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), and AFM nanoindentation. Cellular studies
   demonstrate that such patterned film constructs can be used as model
   systems to investigate and direct cellular adhesion and spreading.
   Finally, this fabrication method is expanded to develop bulk
   polyelectrolyte gels that can be used to develop cell-laden gels.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of a flow field is crucial to guide oceanic mobile sensing
   platforms; yet, existing regional ocean models provide insufficient
   spatial and temporal resolutions for precise guidance of mobile
   platforms. By combining computational ocean models with real-time data
   streams collected from mobile platforms, generic environmental models
   (GEMs) provide high-resolution predictions of ocean currents near the
   mobile platforms. Motion tomography (MT), which is a novel method for
   constructing GEMs, employs trajectory information of multiple mobile
   platforms to create a high-resolution spatial map of ocean flow in the
   region traversed by the mobile platforms. This paper extends the MT
   method to resolve the coupling between temporal variations and spatial
   variations in flow modeling. To incorporate temporal variability of flow
   into MT mapping, MT employs a parametric flow model and constructs a
   time-varying flow field by estimating the parameters of the flow model.
   The original MT problem deals with collective information of all the
   mobile platform trajectories. To address the communication limitation
   for data collection, distributed MT is developed in which mobile
   platforms share their estimated model parameters with other mobile
   platforms nearby. The paper demonstrates that the proposed methods in
   both non-distributed and distributed fashion successfully construct an
   underlying time-varying flow field that affects the trajectories of
   mobile platforms.}},

   matrix with the goal of making the observer robust to the effect of
   current disturbances. The nonlinear observer estimates vehicle's

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to localize underwater gliders in
   observation networks, and this method is also applicable to other
   vehicles. Utilizing the travel time of acoustic signals from
   near-surface acoustic sources, the dead-reckoning positions of
   underwater gliders can be refined. Specifically, compare two kinds of
   travel time, one is simulated by an acoustic model for a series of
   possible positions of underwater gliders, and the other is the measured
   travel time for real positions of underwater gliders, then the most
   possible positions of gliders can be estimated, also the speed of ocean
   currents. The method formulation is based on particle filters, which
   could improve performance of the positioning system over time.
   Simulation is conducted according to experimental environment in the
   South China Sea, and the positioning results are compared with the
   dead-reckoning positions derived from experimental data, validating the
   effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a version of the knapsack problem in which an item size is
   random and revealed only when the decision maker attempts to insert it.
   After every successful insertion the decision maker can choose the next
   item dynamically based on the remaining capacity and available items,
   while an unsuccessful insertion terminates the process. We propose a new
   semi infinite relaxation based on an affine value function
   approximation, and show that an existing pseudo polynomial relaxation
   corresponds to a nonparametric value function approximation. We compare
   both theoretically to other relaxations from the literature and also
   perform a computational study. Our main empirical conclusion is that our
   new relaxation provides tight bounds over a variety of different
   instances and becomes tighter as the number of items increases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the problem of localizing an emitter of radio
   frequency energy using a network of mobile, uncalibrated receiver nodes.
   We show that this received signal strength localization problem can be
   expressed in the form of a nonlinear mixed effects model, by extending
   the log-distance path loss model to include random biases. Doing so
   models drop in received signal strength due to distance (path loss) as
   well as the individual link biases from an uncalibrated network. We
   estimate the unknown bias and noise variance parameters via closed-form
   variance least squares expressions. These estimates are then applied as
   weights in the nonlinear least squares algorithm, alternating until
   convergence. Our simulations show a substantial performance improvement
   over standard nonlinear least squares, comparable to that of the maximum
   likelihood estimator for our model. Our algorithm is much simpler to
   implement vs. maximum likelihood, and also allows the assumption of
   Gaussian noise to be dropped.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in
   inter-cell communication in humans. More importantly, irregular patterns
   over specific miRNAs have been linked to certain types of cancer and
   cardiac diseases. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to
   sense environmental miRNAs and detect certain irregular patterns. We use
   a sensor cell (i.e., biosensor) array comprising of various genes whose
   expression can be suppressed through miRNAs of interest. Interference
   and noise are major issues in miRNA sensing via such a cell array. In
   particular, every miRNA may have a footprint on multiple biosensors and
   each biosensor in the array may be affected by multiple miRNAs. We
   present a probabilistic model capturing this phenomenon and solve the
   detection problem via a factor graph. Since, the exact values of the
   input miRNAs are not needed, fewer observation are required to achieve
   the same level of pattern-detection accuracy relative to directly
   measuring the concentration. Finally, we use Belief Propagation, a
   message-passing algorithm, to infer the presence of irregular patterns.
   Our model-based data suggests significant improvement in performance.}},

   As directly solving the original projection problem is NP-hard and not

   Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the KL-Divergence that relates

   bound KL-divergence penalty by minimizing the l(2)-norm. Using

Abstract = {{The test generation problem for analog/RF circuits has been largely
   intractable due to the fact that repetitive circuit simulation for test
   stimulus optimization is extremely time-consuming. As a consequence, it
   is difficult, if not impossible, to generate tests for practical
   mixed-signal/RF circuits that include the effects of tester inaccuracies
   and measurement noise. To offset this problem and allow test generation
   to scale to different applications, we propose a new approach in which
   FSM models of mixed-signal/RF circuits are abstracted from hardware
   measurements on fabricated devices. These models allow accurate
   simulation of device behavior under arbitrary stimulus and thereby test
   stimulus generation, even after the device has been shipped to a
   customer. As a consequence, it becomes possible to detect process shifts
   with fine granularity and regenerate tests to adapt to process
   perturbations in a dynamic manner without losing test accuracy. A
   complete methodology for such adaptive testing of mixedsignal/RF
   circuits is developed in this paper. Simulation results and hardware
   measurements are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The correct operation of transducers such as electric motors, is
   becoming increasingly important in autonomous systems that depend on the
   reliability of the underlying electronics to deliver Quality of Service
   to the end customer. In this paper, a methodology for detecting errors
   in DC motor operation and adapting its control parameters to compensate
   for the same using continuous linear checksums, is developed. The
   approach is different from prior application of checksum codes to analog
   circuits and servomotor systems, in that none of the states of the DC
   motor are directly controllable. Accordingly, from measurements of the
   observable states of the system, the control law for the motor is
   modified almost instantaneously, to recover motor performance in the
   most optimal manner possible in the presence of parametric deviations
   due to wear and tear. We focus on wear out susceptible
   electro-mechanical anomalies such as loss of torque due to increased
   ball-bearing friction, etc. Simulation results supported by a hardware
   prototype support the viability of the proposed error detection and
   compensation methodology.}},

   conductivity of 237 W/m.K, and here we report our study on the effect of
   inter-filler interactions on the thermal performance of epoxy
   composites. By having fillers to covalently bond with each other in a
   percolated filler network, relative thermal conductivity of nearly 900\%
   is obtained. This work demonstrates the effect of inter-filler bonding
   for thermal enhancement considerations, which can be further applied to
   fillers with higher thermal conductivities for greater thermal

Abstract = {{Direct Cu-Cu bonding has been pursued by the semiconductor industry as
   the next interconnection node, for its superior power-handling
   capability, thermal stability and reliability as compared to traditional
   solders. However, manufacturability of Cu interconnections has so far
   been severely limited by the relatively high modulus of Cu, requiring
   costly planarization processes to address noncoplanarities and warpage
   to enable bonding in solid-state. This paper introduces a new class of
   all-Cu interconnections formed by low-temperature sintering of
   low-modulus nanocopper foams. The physical properties of these foams are
   tunable with their nanostructure and morphology, giving design
   flexibility. The proposed nanocopper interconnections have the following
   advantages: 1) fabrication compatible with standard semiconductor
   infrastructures and processes; 2) sub20GPa elastic modulus pre-sintering
   providing tolerance to non-coplanarities and warpage in assembly; 3)
   densification at temperatures below 250 C to form high-density all-Cu
   interconnections, with excellent electrical and thermal properties; and
   4) wide applicability from ultra-fine pitch to large-area
   interconnections for high-power devices. This paper reports the
   fabrication, characterization and first proof-of concept demonstration
   of sintering of such nanocopper interconnections. Nanocopper foams were
   first synthetized by co-sputtering 2tim Cu2sSi7s (at\%) thin films on
   Si(100) substrates, and then electrochemically dealloying the thin-films
   in hydrofluoric acid under a range of applied voltages. Imaging of the
   foams by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that they
   consisted of 45nm-sized uniform copper ligaments. Further, native oxides
   present in the as-synthetized samples were effectively removed with a
   short etching step in acetic acid, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, without affecting the foams' nanostructure.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characterization indicated an
   exothermal peak at 180 C, beyond which coarsening may initiate. Finally,
   isothermal aging of the nanofoams was carried out in N2 atmosphere at
   100 and 300 C range for 180-900sec. No sintering was observed after
   aging at 150 C, as expected from DSC results, while sintering was
   confirmed after only 180s at 300 C, with observed densification and
   shrinkage of the foam, successfully demonstrating the proposed concept.
   In conclusion, a novel nanocopper foam interconnection technology is
   demonstrated with the potential to address manufacturability,
   scalability and cost across consumer, high performance and automotive
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and demonstration of redistribution
   layers directly on the surface of glass for highspeed 28 Gbps signaling
   applications. An unprecedented demand for bandwidth to support cloud and
   edge computing driven by online services is expected with the continued
   proliferation of connected devices including smartphones, Internet of
   Things, and autonomous electric vehicles. High performance systems
   supporting electrical signal speeds up to and beyond 28 Gbps are
   required, thus driving the development of advanced multi-chip
   architectures such as 2.5D interposers. Silicon interposers have been
   developed and manufactured, but are limited in performance and cost.
   High conductor and dielectric losses limit maximum data rate, while 300
   mm wafer size and expensive damascene processes increase packaging
   costs. Glass interposers provide similar interconnect densities as
   silicon but at higher performance and lower cost. The smooth surface
   roughness (Ra < 10 nm) and low total thickness variation of glass
   enables fine pitch panel lithography approaching back-end-of-line design
   rules, while the lower loss tangent of glass and thicker copper
   metallization reduces dielectric and conductor losses respectively. This
   work describes the design and demonstration of differential, high-speed
   traces on a two-metal layer glass interposer. These redistribution
   layers were fabricated using panel-scalable, semi-additive processes and
   characterized up to f = 40 GHz using on-panel calibration. Differential
   crosstalk below 30 dB up to f = 40 GHz was demonstrated without ground
   shielding at a differential pair spacing greater than 200 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{Bimaterial interfaces, like the one consisting of epoxy mold compound
   (EMC) cured over copper leadframe, are commonly present in
   microelectronic packages. Failure in such bimaterial interfaces can be
   simulated through the use of cohesive zone modeling (CZM). To date,
   nearly all CZM modeling of bimaterial interfaces has been performed for
   monotonic loading conditions. However, most of the interfacial failures
   in microelectronic packages occur during operating conditions where
   repetitive or fatigue loading conditions are present. The CZM work for
   fatigue seen in literature utilizes methods which while demonstrably
   accurate, are data correlation schemes rather than derivations
   formulated from the underlying micromechanical behavior. Most proposed
   fatigue CZM models incorporate fatigue damage by decreasing the critical
   strain energy release rate (SERR), G(c), though a modified CZM damage
   parameter.
   This work presents a new characterization approach which continuously
   modifies CZM parameters as fatigue loading occurs. This new
   characterization method offers the potential of higher predictive value
   as it requires no assumptions beyond that of energy conservation; an
   assumption already inherent to the formulation of cohesive zone
   modeling. Through the addition of fatigue effects to CZM behavior, this
   method is capable of predicting and modeling crack propagation for loads
   below the monotonic critical level.}},

Abstract = {{This paper theoretically and experimentally assesses the board-level
   reliability of glass-based 3D Integrated Passive Device (IPD) with
   TGV-based inductor capacitor (LC) filters in thermal cycling test.
   Important failure modes such as well-known solder joint cracking and TGV
   failure as well as other failure modes such as glass cratering are
   investigated in this work. Through finite-element modeling, initial
   reliability predictions are made using a Morrow-Darveaux approach for
   solder fatigue life. To predict glass cratering, a stress-based approach
   is used. In the second part of this work, reliability experiments are
   conducted on fabricated samples, demonstrating reliable 3D IPD glass
   packages. Failure analysis has found that solder joint cracking and
   glass cratering have occurred, but no TGV failures have occurred. The
   experimental results are also compared to numerical predictions. Then,
   for future designs, the models are used to analyze the impact of key
   material and design parameters on the experimentally observed failure
   modes. It is predicted that reducing the glass core thickness will
   improve solder fatigue life and help prevent glass cratering. Also, TGVs
   are recommended to be kept away from solder joints to prevent glass
   cratering. Stress buffering of the dielectric also improves the
   reliability, though less than glass core thickness. By developing and
   correlating a model specifically for these devices, this work, for the
   first time, enables accurate study and optimization of key design
   parameters for 3D glass IPD radio frequency (RF) devices to achieve high
   mechanically reliability, high-performance long term evolution band
   devices, with potentially smaller footprint and thickness compared to
   current LTCC counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Through silicon vias (TSV) are the enabling components in the emerging
   2.5D and 3D integration microelectronic packaging. The insulation layer,
   i.e. the liner, plays the key role in determining the performance of
   TSV. Polymer liner are receiving a growing attention for its more
   suitable properties and simpler processing compared to the tradition
   silicon dioxide (SiO2) liner. Recently we reported a novel low- kappa
   polymer that can be conformally coated on the surface of the holes as
   the TSV liner by spin coating. The aspect ratio (depth over diameter) of
   TSV used in previous studied was 2:1. However, in many applications such
   as CMOS image sensor, Si interposer and 3D integrated circuits, TSV with
   higher aspect ratio have been broadly adopted. In this paper, we report
   the successful conformal coating of polymer liner in TSV with aspect
   ratio over 5: 1 by spin coating. In a typical experiment, the polymer
   were coated on array of TSVs with diameter of 30 mu m, depth of 160 mu m
   and spacing of 80 mu m. The thickness of polymer after hard baking were
   measured as 8.0 mu m on the top surface of Si, 3.5 mu m at the corner of
   the TSV opening, 3.0 mu m on the sidewall of TSV, and 9.0 mu m at the
   bottom of the TSV. The top surface roughness of the polymer on the
   sidewall was measured to be below 5 nm by atomic force microscope, while
   the sidewall roughness was well below 50 nm under observation of high
   resolution SEM. The ultra-low surface roughness could facilitate the
   facile complete metal filling inside TSV. In the paper, we also
   demonstrate the conformal coating of the polymer in high-aspect-ratio
   TSV with various diameter from 30 mu m to 100 mu m. The challenges in
   the conformal coating as the aspect ratio of TSV increases are
   discussed. The dielectric constant of the polymer was measured to be 3.2
   in frequency range of 10 to 100 kHz, with dissipation factor of 0.02.
   Thermogravimetric analysis showed a half decomposition temperature of
   600 degrees C in the air. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a
   glass transition temperature of 230 degrees C. The reported results
   demonstrate the superior properties of the polymer as TSV liner in a
   broad range of application. More importantly, the simple process
   approach of the polymer using only spin coating make it a promising
   approach in TSV manufacturing with high throughput and economic
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{Through silicon vias are key components in 2.5D and 3D microelectronic
   packaging. Deep silicon etching is the critical step in fabrications of
   TSVs. Uniform metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has been considered
   as a promising method to the conventional deep reaction ion etching for
   deep silicon etching. In this paper, we demonstrated that the uniform
   MaCE method is capable of fabricating vertical holes with a wide range
   of diameter of 5-100 mu m for various TSVs applications. The Au
   catalysts in MaCE of large diameter features show slight deformation,
   possible due to a hindered transport of HF. We have further demonstrated
   that uniform vertical holes can be fabricated by MaCE using Au catalysts
   deposited from either e-beam evaporation or DC sputtering. The sputtered
   Au catalysts, reported for the first time, may carry separated Au
   particles etching laterally and produce pores on the sidewall of the
   etched holes. By optimizing the Au thickness, the sidewall etching could
   be minimized and uniform vertical etching profiles could be achieved.
   The DC sputtering method provides a fast and more accessible way for
   prototype tests in MaCE research and other researches where deep silicon
   etching is required.}},

   strength. The integrated MSC delivered a high stack capacitance of 1.95
   F/cm(3), excellent rate performance, and unique cycling stability (<7\%
   capacitance loss after 10,000 cycles). Moreover, the MSC can withstand
   high strains and retain good electrical property retention after cycling

   enhancement in power transfer efficiency is demonstrated with the
   innovative magnetic films. Energy storage is achieved through a thinfilm

Abstract = {{This paper develops the fundamental performance bounds for a radar
   operating in the presence of communication interference. To do so, we
   recast radar as a communication problem with the radar waveform acting
   as a convolutional encoder, which allows for the description of the
   achievable information-theoretic limits of the radar problem. While
   information theory has been applied to communications and radar, there
   has been little work on applying information theory to systems that
   explicitly combine sensing and communications. The new viewpoint
   presented in this paper, which does not require new mathematics, allows
   one to recast the problem of a radar operating in the presence of
   communication interference as a Gaussian multiple access channel
   problem. The derived bounds describe the fundamental limits on the

Abstract = {{In Electronic Warfare (EW), environment and scene observations are
   crucial in determining which Electronic Attack (EA) or Electronic
   Protection (EP) is most suitable for the current scenario. The
   time-critical nature of these applications requires decisions to be made
   quickly. This paper will discuss a framework which utilizes
   game-theoretic principles in order to provide an autonomous
   determination of the appropriate EA or EP action to be taken for a given
   scenario. This process consists of three stages. First, information is
   gathered about the other emitters in the area. Next, this information is
   processed and used to compute estimates of the utility and costs of each
   potential action. Finally, actions are sorted according to
   effectiveness, based on the expected utility and cost. This paper will
   provide an example of the framework by illustrating how a
   non-cooperative game between a radar sensor emitter and an EA radar
   jammer could be played.}},

Abstract = {{Analysts predict impending shortages in the health care workforce, yet
   wages for health care workers already account for over half of U.S.
   health expenditures. It is thus increasingly important to adequately
   plan to meet health workforce demand at reasonable cost. Using infinite
   linear programming methodology, we propose an infinite-horizon model for
   health workforce planning in a large health system for a single worker
   class; e.g., nurses. We give a series of common-sense conditions that
   any system of this kind should satisfy and use them to prove the
   optimality of a natural lookahead policy. We then use real-world data to
   examine how such policies perform in more complex systems; in
   particular, our experiments show that a natural extension of the
   lookahead policy performs well when incorporating stochastic demand
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to describe an information model, the
   Canonical Robot Command Language (CRCL), which provides a high-level
   description of robot tasks and associated control and status
   information.
   Design/methodology/approach - A common representation of tasks was used
   that is understood by all of the resources required for the job: robots,
   tooling, sensors and people.
   Findings - Using CRCL, a manufacturer can quickly develop robotic
   applications that meet customer demands for short turnaround, enable
   portability across a range of vendor equipment and maintain investments
   in application development through reuse.
   Originality/value - Industrial robots can perform motion with
   sub-millimeter repeatability when programmed using the
   teach-and-playback method. While effective, this method requires
   significant up-front time, tying up the robot and a person during the
   teaching phase.}},

Journal = {{REACTION CHEMISTRY \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{321-329}},
Abstract = {{Seeded reactive crystallization in the manufacture of semi-synthetic
   beta-lactam antibiotics is described and the beneficial effects on yield
   are discussed. Conventional enzymatic synthesis of beta-lactam is
   limited by secondary hydrolysis reactions that consume the desired
   product as it is being produced. Recent work in this area has pointed to
   the potential advantage of performing reactions at conditions that allow
   product crystallization to reduce the rate of secondary hydrolysis by
   protecting ampicillin in the solid phase. However, these approaches led
   to crystallization of both D-phenylglycine and ampicillin, which will
   greatly increase downstream processing. In the work described here,
   seeded crystallization is used to promote secondary nucleation of the
   desired ampicillin while it is being produced by the synthesis reaction,
   thereby selectively crystallizing ampicillin. Quantification of the
   solid phase confirmed selective crystallization of ampicillin with
   purities greater than 95\% wt in all runs.}},

Abstract = {{A reduced graphene oxide(RGO)-polyethylene oxide(PEO) hybrid film was
   constructed with composite and bilayer film structures for effective
   ambient toluene detection. The morphology and chemical properties of the
   fabricated RGO-PEO hybrid materials were characterized by SEM, and Raman
   and FTIR spectroscopies, respectively. Sensitive properties of real-time
   response, sensitivity, repeatability and selectivity to toluene vapor
   were studied as well at room temperature. The experimental data show
   that the gas sensors based on composite film have a higher sensitivity
   than the ones based on bilayer film and pure RGO film at toluene
   concentrations from 80 ppm to 140 ppm. In addition, the effect of PEO
   volume fraction and humidity on the sensing performance was also
   studied. The sensor with a PEO volume fraction of 50\% has a better
   sensitivity and faster response/recovery than others. With respect to
   selectivity, the gas response of the prepared sensors to toluene was at
   least 2-fold higher than those to other vapor species, including
   acetone, ethanol, hydrogen, water and formaldehyde. Furthermore, the
   sensing mechanism of the fabricated sensors was investigated by
   comparing the device performance in the presence of dry air or nitrogen
   as carrier gas.}},

   exemplified the importance for manufacturers to understand their impact
   on water resources. While most manufacturers typically know the amount
   of water they use in their facilities, they have little knowledge about

   indirect impact from electricity use by automakers on water resources is
   examined. Water withdrawal and consumption from electricity use by
   hypothetical but representative facilities around the world is
   quantified and analyzed. The results indicate that the water withdrawal
   and consumption caused by the use of electricity is larger than the
   direct water use and consumption in the facilities themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by two applications (retinal prosthesis and nondestructive
   damage detection), this research develops a new actuator utilizing
   magnetic/electric fields as media to enable open-loop induction control
   of a relatively high-resolution eddy-current pattern on an electrically
   conductive surface with a relatively small number of electromagnets
   (EMs). The actuator referred to here as a magnetic/eddy-current (M/EC)
   continuous field scanner transduces an image into an M/EC pattern
   induced by a two-dimensional EM array. Unlike traditional digital
   stimulation devices where the spatial resolution is defined by discrete
   spacing between two adjacent electrodes, the continuous-field scanner
   accurately controls the synthetized M/EC fields between adjacent EMs.
   Along with a detailed presentation of an analytical model and its
   inverse solutions to enable the continuous-field scanning, this paper
   presents a numerical study to investigate the effects of key design
   parameters, and some preliminary experimental results to validate the
   concept feasibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The 191st Faraday Discussion meeting on ``Nanoparticles with

   insights into an interdisciplinary research field converged at the
   forefronts of chemistry, colloid science, and materials science. It was
   held on the campus of University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. Across the
   street of the meeting place, one could see a large portrait of Thomas
   Graham, the father of physical chemistry who coined the term of
   ``colloid{''} in the 19th century, painted on the outside wall of a tall
   building. Without any doubt, he would also have enjoyed listening to the
   fascinating progress in a research field pioneered by him. The
   discussion was organized into four sessions, with each session covering
   a specific theme: (i) Janus and patchy nanoparticles; (ii) anisotropic
   nanoparticles; (iii) particles at interfaces; and (iv) applications. The
   meeting was further enriched by the presentation of 79 posters. Instead
   of giving a summary of what was presented at the meeting, I would like
   to take this opportunity to provide some personal perspectives, in
   conjunction with the insights offered by various authors.}},

Abstract = {{A distinguishing feature of deep space CubeSats is that they require
   some form of propulsion system, either for orbital maneuvering
   operations, spacecraft momentum management, or both. However, the
   comparatively short lifecycle for these missions, combined with the mass
   and volume restrictions that are attendant with the CubeSat form factor,
   make the integration of propulsion systems one of the highest-risk
   aspects of the entire mission. There are a limited number of facilities
   around the country that can support accurate testing of thruster systems
   that generate milli-Newtons of thrust, and the cost associated with
   handling and transportation of traditional propellants can be
   prohibitive for many CubeSat mission budgets. As a result, many deep
   space CubeSats are considering propulsion systems that are either at a
   fairly low technology readiness level or which will be integrated after
   a truncated test campaign. This paper will describe the propulsion
   system architecture selected for the BioSentinel mission, a six-unit
   CubeSat under development at NASA Ames Research Center. Bio Sentinel
   requires a propulsion system to support detumble and momentum management
   operations, and this paper will discuss the integration of a third-party
   propulsion system with an Ames-built CubeSat, as well as the test
   campaign that is under-way for both quality control and requirements
   verification purposes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and use of an ontology to validate
   model integration and metamodel description in the cyber-physical
   systems engineering domain. A primary goal of the Defense Advanced
   Research Program Agency (DARPA)'s Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) program is
   to reduce product cost by reducing the design space early in the
   engineering life cycle, to enable a high-value focus on reasonable
   alternatives. The OpenMETA tool suite uses semantic constructs for model
   integration across engineering disciplines, and facilitates trade
   analysis across those disciplines (such as electrical, mechanical,
   thermal, fluid, and cyber). Independently, through expert interviews,
   the authors developed a lightweight ontology to represent important
   trades in the early system engineering design process, and have been
   using that ontology as both a communication and validation mechanism for
   the semantics embedded in the OpenMETA tools. The results are informing
   the tool development, providing an independent validation mechanism, and
   creating a layer of the ontology that is extremely useful to both people
   and machines that was not initially obvious. The ontology-based approach

Title = {{Using simulation and optimisation to characterise durations of emergency
   department service times with incomplete data}},

Abstract = {{Simulation models of emergency departments (EDs) are often built based
   on incomplete data, for example, missing arrival times or service-time
   durations. The difficulty in collecting reliable and complete data can
   subsequently lead to invalid simulation results. To tackle this problem,
   we propose a simulation and optimisation method to characterise the
   unavailable durations of service times. Since many services in an ED are
   sequential and dependent on each other, this paper considers these
   multiple process steps cooperatively. We first use lognormal
   distributions to characterise the key service durations. Then we propose
   a new meta-heuristic approach, which combines an Improved Adaptive
   Genetic Algorithm (AGA) and Simulated Annealing (SA), IAGASA, to search
   for the optimal set of service-time distribution parameters. To address
   the difficulties of applying IAGASA when noise is involved in the
   performance measures and improve the simulation efficiency, we jointly
   apply IAGASA and Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) technology.
   OCBA minimises the total simulation cost for achieving a desired level
   of probability of correctly selecting the best set of distribution
   parameters, which improves the search efficiency significantly. The
   experimental results indicate that our proposed method can find accurate
   estimates of service-time distribution parameters within a relatively
   short time.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop PCL scaffolds using
   stereolithography technology and induced modifications using a poly
   dopamine (PDA)-coated/HA precipitate to stimulate human mesenchymal stem
   cells (hMSCs). The chemical composition and surface properties of
   HA/PDA/PLA were characterized by XPS. HA/PDA/PLA modulated hMSCs
   responses in several ways. The extracellular matrix (collagen and
   fibronectin) adsorption was significantly higher on the substrates with
   the highest amount of PDA coating than on pure PCL. Increased focal
   adhesion kinase (FAK) levels and enhanced cell attachment were observed
   upon an increase in PDA content. The proliferation, alkaline
   phosphatase, osteogenesis-related proteins (OPN and BSP), and
   angiogenesis-related protein (vWF and ang-1) secretion of hMSCs were
   significantly stimulated when the PDA-coated concentration was
   increased. The PDA-coated/HA precipitate increases osteogenesis and
   angiogenesis of hMSCs cultured with a PCL scaffold. Our results
   demonstrate that this simple, bio-inspired surface modification of the

Abstract = {{A viable and low-cost strategy for fabricating high-aspect-ratio
   microstructures on silicon (Si) based on a judicious combination of
   flow-enabled self-assembly (FESA) and metal-assisted chemical etching
   (MaCE) is reported. First, polymer patterns were directly formed on a
   bare Si substrate in one step by FESA of polymers in a
   two-parallel-plate setup consisting of a fixed upper plate and a movable
   lower Si substrate that was placed on a programmable translation stage.
   The implementation of FESA to yield polymer patterns eliminates the
   complicated manipulation of polymer resist in conventional lithography
   methods. Subsequently, these polymer patterns were utilized as a stable
   etching mask in the MaCE step and exhibited a remarkable selectivity of
   467 : 1 over Si during etching. Notably, such a combined FESA and MaCE
   strategy (i.e., a FESA-MaCE route) avoids the use of a hard mask which
   is necessary for the conventional plasma etching method. During MaCE, a
   layer of Au thin film was used as a catalyst and hydrogen
   peroxide-hydrofluoric acid solution was employed as the etching
   solution. Consequently, trenches and gratings on Si at a micrometer
   scale with uniform controllable geometry were successfully produced. The
   aspect ratio of microstructures was up to 16 : 1 and the lateral edge
   roughness was below 0.5 mu m. The influence of processing conditions on
   the geometry of the etched structures was scrutinized through a
   comparative study. The geometry of the etched structures was found to
   effectively adjust their surface wettability in a continuous manner.
   Clearly, due to the ease of implementation and the batch processing
   capability, the FESA-MaCE strategy is promising in manufacturing a broad
   range of high-quality Si-based devices at low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Residual stress in the machined surface and subsurface is affected by
   materials, machining conditions, and tool geometry and can affect the
   component life and service quality significantly. Empirical or numerical
   experiments are commonly used for determining residual stresses but
   these are very expensive. There has been an increase in the utilization
   of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) in recent years in order to reduce
   the cost and tool/part handling efforts, while its effect on machined
   part residual stress, although important, has not been explored. This
   paper presents a hybrid neural network that is trained using Simulated
   Annealing (SA) and Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LM) in order to
   predict the values of residual stresses in cutting and radial direction
   on the surface and within the work piece after the MQL face turning
   process. Once the ANN has successfully been trained, an optimization
   procedure, using Genetic Algorithm (GA), is applied in order to find the
   best cutting conditions in order to minimize the surface tensile
   residual stresses and maximize the compressive residual stresses within
   the work piece. The optimization results show that the usage of MQL
   decreases the surface tensile residual stresses and increases the
   compressive residual stresses within the work piece.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of jet fuel composition on ignition probability have been
   studied in a flowfield that is relevant to turbine engine combustors,
   but also fundamental and conducive to modeling. In the experiments, a
   spark kernel is ejected from a wall and propagates transversely into a
   crossflow. The kernel first encounters an air-only stream before
   transiting into a second, flammable (premixed) stream. The two streams
   have matched velocities, as verified by hot-wire measurements. The
   liquid fuels span a range of physical and chemical kinetic properties.
   To focus on their chemical differences, the fuels are prevaporized in a
   carrier air flow before being injected into the experimental facility.
   Ignition probabilities at atmospheric pressure and elevated cross flow
   temperature were determined from optical measurements of a large number
   of spark events, and high speed imaging was used to characterize the
   kernel evolution. Eight fuel blends were tested experimentally; all
   exhibited increasing ignition probability as equivalence ratio
   increased, at least up to 1.5. Statistically significant differences
   between fuels were measured that have some correlation with fuel
   properties. To elucidate these trends, the forced ignition process was
   also studied with a reduced order numerical model of an entraining
   kernel. The simulations suggest ignition is successful if sufficient
   heat release occurs before entrainment of colder crossflow fluid
   quenches the exothermic oxidation reactions. As the kernel is
   initialized in air, it remains lean during the initial entrainment of
   the fuel-air mixture; thus richer crossflows lead to quicker and higher
   exothermicity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an analysis of the unsteady flow structures in a
   single nozzle and triple nozzle swirl combustor (with nozzle spacing of
   s/D=2.9). It was motivated by a prior study by our group which compared
   the time averaged and unsteady features for a different swirling nozzle,
   and found that the single and triple nozzle flow dynamics were quite
   similar upstream of the jet merging region. This work is motivated by
   the fact that realistic hardware, whether in can or annular combustion
   systems, almost always contains several nozzles. However, it is common
   to use test facilities with a single nozzle to study flame dynamics, a
   key component of the combustion instability problem {[}1]. Simultaneous
   OH Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (OH PLIF) and Stereoscopic Particle
   Image Velocimetry (sPIV) techniques were performed at 5 kHz on a swirl
   methane-air flame. Two transverse forcing configurations were applied,
   so that the flame nominally lies in a pressure node/transverse velocity
   antinode, and vice versa. The time averaged flow fields of the single
   and triple nozzle configurations are compared, and several key
   differences are identified. Most prominently, there are non-negligible
   differences in the recirculation zone reverse flow velocity and flame
   spreading angle. However, the spatial variation of the disturbance
   magnitudes along the shear layers exhibit quite similar growth and decay
   trends, and the convection speeds along the shear layer were nearly
   identical. These results corroborate the findings of Aguilar et al.
   {[}2] and Szedlmayer et al. {[}3], which show that despite differences
   in time average quantities, comparable flow dynamics occur in single and
   multi- nozzle flames. These results imply that useful insights into the
   dynamics of multi-nozzle systems can be gleaned from appropriately
   designed single-nozzle hardware, with appropriate accounting for the
   differences in time averaged flow/flame characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling stem cell (SC) fate is an extremely important topic in the
   realm of SC research. A variety of different external cues mainly
   mechanical, chemical, or electrical stimulations individually or in
   combination have been incorporated to control SC fate. Here, we will
   deconstruct the probable relationship between the functioning of
   electromagnetic (EMF) and SC fate of a variety of different SCs. The
   electromagnetic (EM) nature of the cells is discussed with the emphasis
   on the effects of EMF on the determinant factors that directly and/or
   indirectly influence cell fate. Based on the EM effects on a variety of
   cellular processes, it is believed that EMFs can be engineered to
   provide a controlled signal with the highest impact on the SC fate
   decision. Considering the novelty and broad applications of applying
   EMFs to change SC fate, it is necessary to shed light on many unclear
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.}},

Title = {{Strongly anisotropic thermal and electrical conductivities of a
   self-assembled silver nanowire network}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{93}},
Pages = {{90674-90681}},
Abstract = {{Heat dissipation issues are emerging challenges in the field of flexible
   electronics. Thermal management of flexible electronics creates a demand
   for flexible materials with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity,
   which work as heat spreaders to remove excess heat in the in-plane
   direction and as heat shields to protect human skin or device components
   under them from heating. To solve these challenges, this study proposes
   a self-assembled silver nanowire network with high thermal and
   electrical anisotropy. We measured the in-plane thermal conductivity of
   the network along the axial direction of silver nanowires as 37 W m(-1)
   K-1 and the cross-plane thermal conductivity as only 0.36 W m(-1) K-1.
   The results of measurements of electrical and thermal conductivities
   suggest that abundant wire-wire contacts strongly impede thermal
   transport. The excellent alignment of nanowires results in the same
   anisotropy ratio of three for both thermal and electrical conduction in
   the two in-plane directions. The ratio remains unchanged as the
   temperature decreases to 50 K, indicating that wire-wire contacts lower
   the thermal and electrical conduction in the two directions to the same
   extent, and their effect is independent of temperature. In addition,
   phonon softening markedly reduces the Debye temperatures of the network,
   which are fitted from electrical resistivity data. As a result of phonon
   thermal conduction and localized phonon assisted energy transfer near
   boundaries, the Lorenz numbers of the film in the two directions, which
   are approximately the same, are larger than the Sommerfeld value at room
   temperature and decrease as the temperature decreases because of small
   angle scattering and the reduced number of phonons. This nanowire
   network provides a candidate solution to the emerging challenges of the
   thermal management of flexible electronics.}},

   Prediction Under Effect of Winter Weather Events}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2551}},
Pages = {{52-61}},
Abstract = {{Most existing models for prediction of pavement marking
   retroreflectivity have been developed from data collected in locations
   with similar weather conditions; therefore, the effect of different
   weather conditions, such as winter weather events, has not been
   extensively studied. This study develops degradation models that can
   predict retroreflectivity of durable pavement marking materials under
   various winter weather conditions. Piecewise multiple linear models are
   proposed to explicitly account for the effect of winter weather events
   in this study. In comparisons of the proposed models with conventional
   multiple linear models (MILMs) developed from the same set of data, the
   proposed models outperformed the MLMs, and the overall root-mean-square
   error improved from 204.6 mcd/m(2)/lux for MLMs to 106.5 mcd/m(2)/lux
   for piecewise MLMs. The proposed models also show robust and consistent
   results in predicting retroreflectivity of different materials in
   different states. The results indicate that the proposed method can be
   adopted by various states and regions for comprehensive
   retroreflectivity prediction under various weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A high temperature thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system is modeled and its
   system level performance is assessed in the context of concentrated
   solar power (CSP) with thermal energy storage (TES). The model includes
   the treatment of the emitter and the heat transfer fluid that draws
   thermal energy from the TES, which then allows for the identification
   and prioritization of the most important TPV cell/module level
   properties that should be optimized to achieve maximum performance. The
   upper limiting efficiency for an idealized system is then calculated,
   which shows that TPV with TES may one day have the potential to become
   competitive with combined cycle turbines, but could also offer other
   advantages that would give CSP an advantage over fossil based
   alternatives. The system concept is enabled by the usage of liquid metal
   as a high temperature heat transfer and TES fluid. The system concept
   combines the great economic advantages of TES with the potential for low
   cost and high performance derived from TPV cells fabricated on reusable
   substrates, with a high reflectivity back reflector for photon
   recycling.}},

Abstract = {{Some of the world's most well-known IT companies are in fact advertising
   companies deriving their primary revenues through digital advertising.
   For this reason, these IT giants are able to continually drive the
   evolutions of information technology in ways that serve to enhance our
   everyday lives. The benefits of this relationship include free web
   browsers with powerful search engines and mobile applications. Still, it
   turns out that ``free{''} comes at a cost that is paid through our
   interactions within a digital advertising ecosystem. Digital advertising
   is not without its challenges. Issues originate from the complex
   platforms utilized to support advertising over web and mobile
   application interfaces. This is especially true for advertising links.
   Additionally, as new methods for advertising develop so too does the
   potential for impacting its underlying ecosystem for good or ill.
   Accordingly, researchers are interested in understanding this ecosystem,
   the factors that impact it, and the strategies for improving it. The
   major contribution of this survey is that it is the first review of the
   digital advertising ecosystem as it applies to online websites and
   mobile applications. In doing so, we explain the digital advertising
   relationships within this ecosystem along with their technical, social,
   political, and physical implications. Furthermore, advertising

Abstract = {{Pyruvate is an essential metabolite in the central metabolism of
   microbes, and it has been widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and
   agrochemical industries. Both chemical and biological processes have
   been used for industrial pyruvate production. In this study, one-step
   pyruvate production from D/L-alanine with a whole-cell E. coli
   biocatalyst expressing L-amino acid deaminase (pm1) from Proteus
   mirabilis was investigated. Alanine uptake transporters (cycA, amaP) and
   a pyruvate uptake transporter (lldP) were knocked out to prevent
   substrate and product utilization by the biocatalyst. The pyruvate
   production titer from D/L-alanine increased from 1.14 g L-1 under
   control conditions to 5.38 g L-1 with the mutant whole-cell biocatalyst.
   Directed evolution was used to engineer pm1 and improve the catalytic
   activity with D/L-alanine. Three rounds of error-prone polymerase chain
   reaction generated the mutant pm1ep3, which showed improved affinity
   (6.76 mM for L-alanine) and catalytic efficiency (0.085 s(-1) mM(-1) and
   0.027 s(-1) mM(-1) for L- and D-alanine, respectively). The final
   pyruvate titer was increased to 14.57 g L-1 and the conversion ratio was
   increased to 29.14\% by using the engineered whole-cell biocatalyst
   containing the evolved pm1ep3.}},

Title = {{Low cost, high performance flexible asymmetric supercapacitor based on
   modified filter paper and an ultra-fast packaging technique}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{83564-83572}},
Abstract = {{A flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FAAS) was prepared
   via a low-cost method with commonly used paper fibers as the substrate
   and a modified polymer-based hydrogel as the electrolyte. In the
   designed structure of the positive electrode, a three dimensional
   network of stacked thin film based on paper fibers (PFs), chemically
   reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and the electro-polymerization of
   polyaniline (PANI) nanorods was prepared via an extended filtration
   assisted method. The fabricated PF-RGO-PANI electrodes exhibit large
   specific capacitance of 587 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.8 A
   g(-1) and excellent cycling stability (99.6\% retention of initials
   specific capacitance even after 5000 cycles). PF-RGO film was introduced
   as the negative electrode for the designed asymmetric supercapacitor.
   During the preparation process of FAAS, a glutaraldehyde (GA)
   cross-linked PVA-H2SO4 hydrogel was not only used as the electrolyte but
   also explored as a separator and external packaging material prepared by
   a fast layer-by-layer assembly technique within one minute. The resulted
   FAAS exhibits a maximum energy density and power density of 175 W h
   kg(-1) and 9200 W kg(-1). Moreover, superior mechanical stability of the
   FAAS has been demonstrated by testing its bending and folding
   performance, which retains over 84\% of its original specific
   capacitance even after 2000 cycles of bending and folding. The simple
   and low-cost preparation process of electrodes, the ultra-fast flexible
   supercapacitor assembling and the efficient packaging technique proposed
   in this study provide a good contribution to the development of FAAS for
   the next generation flexible energy storage devices.}},

Title = {{Mechanical behaviors of AlCrFeCuNi high-entropy alloys under uniaxial
   tension via molecular dynamics simulation}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{80}},
Abstract = {{Although a high-entropy alloy has exhibited promising mechanical
   properties, little attention has been given to the dynamics deformation
   mechanism during uniaxial tension, which limits its widespread and
   practical utility. According to the experiment, an atomic model
   AlCrFeCuNi HEA was built using a melting and quick quenching method. In
   this work, the mechanical behaviors of the AlCrFeCuNi high-entropy alloy
   under uniaxial tensile loading are studied using atomistic simulation to
   investigate the evolution of dislocation and stacking fault as well as
   deformation twinning. The results show that calculations for the elastic
   properties and stress-strain relations are in excellent agreement with
   recent experimental results. Above all, the AlCrFeCuNi1.4 HEA not only
   has high strength, but also exhibits good plasticity which is
   qualitatively consistent with the experiment. Similar to the mechanical
   properties of single-crystal metals, stress fluctuation during plastic
   deformation of the high-entropy alloy is always accompanied with the
   generation and motion of dislocation and stacking fault with the
   increase of strain. In addition, the dislocation-dislocation
   interaction, dislocation-solid solution interaction, deformation
   twinning and detwinning occur after the yield point. Furthermore, the
   dislocation gliding, dislocation pinning due to the severe
   lattice-distortion and solid solution, and twinning are still the main
   mechanisms of plastic deformation in the AlCrFeCuNi1.4 high-entropy
   alloy. This atomistic mechanism provides a fundamental understanding of
   plastic deformation in a high-entropy alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing factories are always in pursuit of achieving higher
   productivity in order to satisfy the growing demands of the consumers
   but are often meet with challenges in achieving these goals due to
   various complexities. These complexities arise from the limitations of
   human operator's i.e. their inability to handle uncertainties,
   complexity, and understand/memorize large data. Intelligent
   manufacturing systems are positioned to yield superior results than
   traditional manufacturing as they are capable of analyzing,
   self-learning, apprehending complexity, and self-driven for quality and
   cost. Unlike traditional manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing
   systems are also able to store and analyze large amounts of production
   data in order to achieve higher production rate and shorten the
   time-to-market. This keynote is to provide a longitudinal perspective on
   various aspects of recent achievements in intelligent design,
   scheduling, maintenance, and control. For each aspect, concept,
   requirement, and application implemented, methodologies deployed are
   also presented along with their limitations and future research
   directions. This keynote also presents fundamental concepts and

Journal = {{COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{1496-1537}},
Abstract = {{A numerical study of premixed flame-turbulence interaction is performed
   to investigate the effects of turbulence on the structural features of
   the flame and the subgrid-scale (SGS) effects on vorticity dynamics,
   energy transfer mechanism, and turbulent transport across the flame. We
   consider a freely propagating methane-air turbulent premixed flame
   interacting with a decaying isotropic turbulence under three different
   initial conditions corresponding to the corrugated flamelet (CF), the
   thin reaction zone (TRZ), and the broken/distributed reaction zone
   (B/DRZ) regimes. We employ the well-established linear eddy mixing (LEM)
   model in large-eddy simulation (LEMLES), a new subgrid closure for
   reaction-diffusion occurring in the small-scales based on LEM (RRLES),
   and a quasi-laminar chemistry based closure in large-eddy simulation
   (QLLES) to simulate flame-turbulence interactions and to compare
   predictions with direct numerical simulation (DNS). We assess the
   accuracy and robustness of the closures by comparing statistical
   features to highlight their abilities and limitations. The newly
   proposed RRLES subgrid closure uses a dual-resolution grid for solving
   the species transport equations. Such an approach is shown to improve
   the existing LEMLES subgrid model especially at low Reynolds numbers.
   All SGS closures reveals good agreement, although there are some
   differences due to the closure used for convective transport of the
   scalar field and the reaction rate. Further analysis of the DNS dataset
   shows that there is a significant contribution by dilatation and
   baroclinic torque terms across the flame. In particular, at higher
   Karlovitz number, there is an abrupt change in the sign of the
   dilatation term, which is related to the competing effects of thermal
   expansion due to heat release and enhanced molecular mixing by the
   turbulence across the flame brush region. The enhanced mixing leads to
   localized pockets of cold reactants surrounded by hot products, which is
   only partly captured by the employed closures. The analysis of SGS
   kinetic energy and scalar dissipation rates indicates the presence of
   back-scatter of turbulent kinetic energy, and we also observe
   counter-gradient transport across the flame. The results suggest that
   further improvement of the traditional closures is needed to accurately
   capture the dynamics of flame-turbulence interaction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Ductile grinding of brittle materials has been demonstrated in achieving
   desired machining quality without deteriorating surface and subsurface
   quality and any post processing work. However, it is still in a low
   efficiency in micro-machining or conventional grinding. In this paper, a
   high speed diamond grinder was exploited to explore ductile grinding of
   SiC at a relatively higher material removal. A combination of ground
   surface, subsurface and grinding chips SEM observations are given to
   explain the high speed grinding mechanism for SiC. This study indicates
   that ductile grinding of SiC can be achieved through a combination of
   the increase of the wheel speed and the control of grinding depth.
   Moreover, the critical chip thickness for ductile grinding of SiC can be
   greatly improved under a higher grinding speed comparing to conventional
   speed grinding. Correspondingly, the material removal volumes can be
   substantially enhanced in high speed grinding while not affecting
   subsurface and surface integrity.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a chemically-induced oral cancer animal model and a
   computer aided method for tongue cancer diagnosis. The animal model
   allows us to monitor the progress of the lesions over time. Tongue
   tissue dissected from mice was sent for histological processing.
   Representative areas of hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained tissue from
   tongue sections were captured for classifying tumor and non-tumor
   tissue. The image set used in this paper consisted of 214 color images
   (114 tumor and 100 normal tissue samples). A total of 738 color,
   texture, morphometry and topology features were extracted from the
   histological images. The combination of image features from epithelium
   tissue and its constituent nuclei and cytoplasm has been demonstrated to
   improve the classification results. With ten iteration nested cross
   validation, the method achieved an average sensitivity of 96.5\% and a
   specificity of 99\% for tongue cancer detection. The next step of this
   research is to apply this approach to human tissue for computer aided
   diagnosis of tongue cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Sequencing errors are a major issue for several next-generation
   sequencing-based applications such as de novo assembly and single
   nucleotide polymorphism detection. Several error-correction methods have
   been developed to improve raw data quality. However, error-correction
   performance is hard to evaluate because of the lack of a ground truth.
   In this study, we propose a novel approach which using ERCC RNA spike-in
   controls as the ground truth to facilitate error-correction performance
   evaluation. After aligning raw and corrected RNA-seq data, we
   characterized the quality of reads by three metrics: mismatch patterns
   (i.e., the substitution rate of A to C) of reads aligned with one
   mismatch, mismatch patterns of reads aligned with two mismatches and the
   percentage increase of reads aligned to reference. We observed that the
   mismatch patterns for reads aligned with one mismatch are significantly
   correlated between ERCC spike-ins and real RNA samples. Based on such
   observations, we conclude that ERCC spike-ins can serve as ground truths
   for error correction beyond their previous applications for validation
   of dynamic range and fold-change response. Also, the mismatch patterns
   for ERCC reads aligned with one mismatch can serve as a novel and
   reliable metric to evaluate the performance of error-correction tools.}},

Abstract = {{RNA sequencing, or RNA-seq for short, is widely applied for extracting
   gene and transcript expression from biological samples. Given numerous
   quantification pipelines for RNA-seq data, one fundamental challenge is
   to identify a pipeline that can produce the most accurate gene and/or
   transcript expression. Exploring all pipelines requires extensive
   computational resources, so we propose to use a subsampling approach
   that can speed up the pipeline evaluation and selection process. We
   applied our approach to one simulated and two real RNA-seq datasets and
   found that expression estimates derived from subsampled data are close
   surrogates for those derived from original data. In addition, the
   ranking of quantification pipelines based on the subsampled data was
   highly concordant with that based on the original data. Therefore, we
   conclude that subsampling is a valid approach to facilitating efficient
   quantification pipeline selection using RNA-seq data.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic food intake monitoring using wearable systems is a promising
   research direction in the fight against obesity and eating disorders.
   Previous work has indicated progress towards automatic food intake
   monitoring using acoustic sensors for detecting periods of food intake,
   swallowing and chewing detection, and discriminating between solid and
   liquid food intake. However, little effort has been put towards acoustic
   detection in noisy recordings. In this paper, we explore detecting food
   intake events ( particularly chew events) in the presence of restaurant
   background noise. Three templates were extracted from a clean signal to
   represent the beginning, middle and end phase of a chewing sequence.
   Then, each template was used with sliding window correlation to detect
   chew events in a noisy recording. The noisy signal was formed by
   instantaneous addition of a clean throat microphone recording during
   eating and restaurant noise recorded with the same throat microphone.
   Results show that the template created from the end phase of a chewing
   sequence outperformed templates from the beginning and middle phases for
   detecting chew events in a continuous clean and noisy test signal. An
   F-1 score of 71.4\% was achieved for detecting chews in very low
   signal-to-noise ratio of -10 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent motor disorder that appears in early
   age and it requires multiple tests to assess the physical and mental
   capabilities of the patients. Current medical record data collection
   systems, e.g., EPIC, employed for CP are very general, difficult to
   navigate, and prone to errors. The data cannot easily be extracted which
   limits data analysis on this rich source of information. To overcome
   these limitations, we designed and prototyped a database with a
   graphical user interface geared towards clinical research specifically
   in CP. The platform with MySQL and Java framework is reliable, secure,
   and can be easily integrated with other programming languages for data
   analysis such as MATLAB. This database with GUI design is a promising
   tool for data collection and can be applied in many different fields
   aside from CP to infer useful information out of the vast amount of data
   being collected.}},

Abstract = {{Ballistocardiography (BCG), the measure of the reactionary forces of the
   body to cardiac ejection of blood into the vasculature, has recently
   re-emerged as a viable tool for estimation of mechanical parameters
   related to cardiovascular health in non-clinical settings. BCG
   measurements can be taken using a variety of sensors: some modalities
   require the person to be stationary, with sensors embedded in the
   environment that the person interacts with; others can be placed on the
   body, and potentially measure the signals throughout the day in
   naturalistic settings. The latter modality in particular can enhance the
   existing ``quantified-self{''} ecosystem, providing complementary
   cardiovascular information regarding hemodynamics and systolic time
   intervals that otherwise cannot be measured currently. However, prior
   research in wearable BCG measurements has focused on taking measurements
   from stationary subjects only, thus limiting the potential impact of
   wearable sensing, and precluding any potential analysis of
   cardiovascular responses to exercise stressors. The primary technical
   obstacle towards wearable measurements from ambulatory subjects is that
   motion artifacts can render the BCG signals unreadable. In this paper,
   we present a framework for robust estimation of systolic time intervals
   from wearable BCG measurements during walking at different speeds. We
   demonstrate, using pattern matching techniques and multi-sensor data
   fusion, a good correlation value between the pre-ejection period (PEP)
   from the gold standard impedance cardiogram (ICG) and the BCG features
   and also between left ventricle ejection time (LVET) estimated from both
   modalities. Based on the results, we anticipate that wearable
   ballistocardiography can be used for continuously monitoring patients
   outside clinics and titrating care.}},

Abstract = {{Ballistocardiography (BCG) is a non-invasive measure of the reactionary
   forces of the body to cardiac ejection of blood into the vasculature.
   BCG signals are currently measured by modified weighing scales, chairs,
   beds, or wearable tri-axial accelerometers. In this work, we measure the
   BCG using a high bandwidth multicomponent force plate and compare the
   timing accuracy of our measured signals with a weighing scale BCG that
   we have developed and verified in prior studies. We also examine the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of BCG signals obtained with each of the two
   instruments. Our results indicate that the force plate BCG measurement
   provides more accurate timing information as it allows for more reliable
   prediction of the pre-ejection period (PEP) - the time the ventricles
   spend in isovolumetric contraction - than the scale BCG ( r(2)=0.83 vs
   r(2)=0.73). The SNR comparison results were as follows: although the
   force plate BCG has a slightly better SNR, the improvement is not
   significant and we conclude that SNR is limited by motion artifacts
   rather than instrumentation.}},

   integrates multiple data modalities to produce a single prediction
   result, outperforms both single-data-modality prediction and majority

   data, elimination of motion artifacts in PPG signals using recursive

   experimental results were compared to the ground truth heart rate, which
   comes from simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of Rh icosahedra with average sizes up to
   12.0 +/- 0.8 nm through the use of a relatively slow reduction process.
   By using Rh(acac)(3) as a precursor to Rh and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
   (PVP) as a reducing agent, the reduction kinetics can be manipulated
   such to promote the formation of twin defects in the Rh nanocrystals.
   When Rh(acac)(3) is replaced by other precursors containing mono-dentate
   ligands, single-crystal Rh nanocrystals are obtained due to the
   acceleration of reduction rate. By in-creasing the molecular weight of
   PVP from 10000 to 1300 000, the resulting Rh nanocrystals are
   transformed from single-crystal octahedra to multiply twinned icosahedra
   and stacking-fault-lined plates. These results suggest that the
   successful preparation of Rh icosahedra could be facilitated by varying
   the binding strength of a ligand to Rh in the precursor and/or the
   molecular weight of PVP to optimize the reduction kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors are commonly used
   in subsurface detection applications because of their efficacy at
   detecting even small fragments of metal when they are buried near the
   surface. This efficacy can become a shortcoming when the detector is
   expected to locate specific classes of targets that are buried among
   metallic clutter. For these applications, broadband EMI sensors have
   shown considerable promise at being able to detect, classify and locate
   targets such as land mines, and discriminate between them and the
   clutter with low false -alarm rates. In such cases, where
   differentiating targets from clutter is a significant obstacle,
   detection strategies based on the discrete spectrum of relaxation
   frequencies (DSRF) have been shown to be highly effective. For such
   purposes, a dictionary of DSRF of targets of interest must be computed a
   priori. Several classes of targets such as sphere and rings have DSRF
   that can be derived analytically, however, in general, the DSRF must be
   computed numerically. Previously, numerical strategies have been
   presented for thin conducting shells and rotationaly symmetric targets.
   In this paper, we will present a strategy to compute the DSRF of
   arbitrary conducting targets using a null space free Jacobi Davidson
   iteration (NFJD).}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces two advances in wide-band electromagnetic induction
   (EMI) processing: a novel adaptive matched filter (AMF) and matched
   subspace detection methods. Both advances make use of recent work with a
   subspace SVD approach to separating the signal, soil, and noise
   subspaces of the frequency measurements.(1) The proposed AMF provides a
   direct approach to removing the EMI self-response while improving the
   signal to noise ratio of the data. Unlike previous EMI adaptive
   downtrack filters, this new filter will not erroneously optimize the EMI
   soil response instead of the EMI target response because these two
   responses are projected into separate frequency subspaces. The EMI
   detection methods in this work elaborate on how the signal and noise
   subspaces in the frequency measurements are ideal for creating the
   matched subspace detection (MSD) and constant false alarm rate matched
   subspace detection (CFAR) metrics developed by Scharf.(2) The CFAR
   detection metric has been shown to be the uniformly most powerful
   invariant detector.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous-wave (CW) electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems used for
   subsurface sensing typically employ separate transmit and receive coils
   placed in close proximity. The closeness of the coils is desirable for
   both packaging and object pinpointing; however, the coils must have as
   little mutual coupling as possible. Otherwise, the signal from the
   transmit coil will couple into the receive coil, making target detection
   difficult or impossible. Additionally, mineralized soil can be a
   significant problem when attempting to detect small amounts of metal
   because the soil effectively couples the transmit and receive coils.
   Optimization of wire coils to improve their performance is difficult but
   can be made possible through a stream-function representation and the
   use of partially convex forms. Examples of such methods have been
   presented previously, but these methods did not account for certain
   practical issues with coil implementation. In this paper, the power
   constraint introduced into the optimization routine is modified so that
   it does not penalize areas of high current. It does this by representing
   the coils as plates carrying surface currents and adjusting the sheet
   resistance to be inversely proportional to the current, which is a good
   approximation for a wire -wound coil. Example coils are then optimized
   for minimum mutual coupling, maximum sensitivity, and minimum soil
   response at a given height with both the earlier, constant sheet
   resistance and the new representation. The two sets of coils are
   compared both to each other and other common coil types to show the
   method's viability.}},

Abstract = {{A method using feedback is presented that reduces several measurement
   errors inherent in electromagnetic induction sensors. Errors associated
   with coupling between receive coils and errors associated with operating
   near magnetic soils will both be reduced. The method uses feedback that

   secondary coils. A simple circuit is introduced to perform the feedback
   and is optimized to reduce the errors and make the circuit stable.
   Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Lignins from various poplar genotypes were isolated by using organosolv
   fractionation and subjected to rheological treatment at various
   temperatures. Physicochemical characterization of the lignin variants
   shows a broad distribution of glass transition temperatures, melt
   viscosity, and pyrolysis char residues. Rheological treatment at 170
   degrees C induces lignin repolymerization accompanied with an increase
   in condensed linkages, molecular weights, and viscosities. In contrast,
   rheology testing at 190 degrees C results in the decrease in lignin
   aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl groups, beta-O-aryl ether linkages,
   molecular weights, and viscosity values. Lignin under air cooling
   generates more oxygenated and condensed compounds, but lower amounts of
   ether linkages than lignin cooled under nitrogen. Lignin with a lower
   syringyl/guaiacyl ratio tends to form more cross-linkages along with
   higher viscosity values, higher molecular weight and larger amounts of
   condensed bonds.}},

Abstract = {{We have derived an axially symmetric three-dimensional analytical
   solution for thermoelastic deformations and stresses in a layered medium
   irradiated by a laser beam. The solution was obtained for Gaussian
   radial temperature profile on the upper surface of the elastic layer, in
   the assumption that temperature decreases exponentially with depth. The
   developed theoretical model was used to calculate distributions of
   laser-induced deformations and displacements in a medium containing
   single layer over a half-space. The influence of the shear elastic
   properties of the layer and half-space on the stress and strain
   distributions was evaluated. It was shown that tissue response depends
   significantly on the elastic contrast between the layer and the
   half-space. The proposed solution could be used in photomechanical
   models of laser ablation of inhomogeneous materials and tissues.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new fault-tolerant algorithm for the problem of computing
   the connected components of a graph. Our algorithm derives from a highly
   parallel but non-resilient algorithm, which is based on the technique of
   label propagation (LP). To make the LP algorithm resilient to transient
   soft faults, we apply an algorithmic design principle that we refer to
   as self-correction. Briefly, a self-correcting algorithm detects if it
   has reached an invalid state given that it was previously in a known
   valid state; and if so, restores itself back to a valid state assuming
   the availability of a selective guaranteed-reliable mode. Our
   self-correcting algorithm, FT-LP, has relatively small storage and
   computation overheads: in empirical tests on a variety of input graphs,
   we observe execution time overheads of 10-35\% in FT-LP compared to LP
   even at high fault rates, with the computation overhead increasing
   gracefully as fault rates increase.}},

   Imaging}},
Journal = {{THERANOSTICS}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{1866-1876}},
Abstract = {{Microbubbles are widely used as contrast agents to improve the
   diagnostic capability of conventional, highly speckled, low-contrast
   ultrasound imaging. However, while microbubbles can be used for
   molecular imaging, these agents are limited to the vascular space due to
   their large size (> 1 mu m). Smaller microbubbles are desired but their
   ultrasound visualization is limited due to lower echogenicity or higher
   resonant frequencies. Here we present nanometer scale, phase changing,
   blinking nanocapsules (BLInCs), which can be repeatedly optically
   triggered to provide transient contrast and enable background-free
   ultrasound imaging. In response to irradiation by near-infrared laser
   pulses, the BLInCs undergo cycles of rapid vaporization followed by
   recondensation into their native liquid state at body temperature. High
   frame rate ultrasound imaging measures the dynamic echogenicity changes
   associated with these controllable, periodic phase transitions. Using a
   newly developed image processing algorithm, the blinking particles are
   distinguished from tissue, providing a background-free image of the
   BLInCs while the underlying B-mode ultrasound image is used as an
   anatomical reference of the tissue. We demonstrate the function of
   BLInCs and the associated imaging technique in a tissue-mimicking
   phantom and in vivo for the identification of the sentinel lymph node.
   Our studies indicate that BLInCs may become a powerful tool to identify
   biological targets using a conventional ultrasound imaging system.}},

Abstract = {{A new technique for performance regulation in event-driven systems,
   recently proposed by the authors, consists of an adaptive-gain integral
   control. The gain is adjusted in the control loop by a real-time
   estimation of the derivative of the plant-function with respect to the
   control input. This estimation is carried out by Infinitesimal
   Perturbation Analysis (IPA). The main motivation comes from applications
   to throughput regulation in computer processors, where to-date, the
   testing of the proposed control technique has been assessed by
   simulation. The purpose of this paper is to report on its implementation
   on Intel's Haswell microprocessor, and compare its performance to that
   obtained from cycle-level, full system simulation environment. The
   intrinsic contribution of the paper to the Workshop on Discrete Event
   Systems is in describing the process of taking an IPA-based design and
   simulation to a concrete implementation, thereby providing a bridge

Abstract = {{We have visualized two phase flow cooling of R245fa refrigerant in a 1
   cm x 1 cm x 200 mu m microgap, equipped with circular pin-fins. The
   device has the microgap with sparse circular pin-fin arrangement of

   225 mu m, and 75 mu m, respectively. On the back side of the chip, four
   integrated platinum heaters are fabricated and are arranged in series.
   The microgap is installed in a closed flow loop that is pressurized. The
   inlet flow is subcooled at the elevated pressure. Flow boiling is
   obtained in the microgap for a range of heat flux values between 7
   W/cm(2) to 34 W/cm(2). Using a high speed camera, flow visualization

Abstract = {{Transmission lines carrying high-speed I/O signals that traverse through
   different metal layers in a printed circuit board suffer from return
   path discontinuities. As a result, significant amount of electromagnetic
   energy can couple to surrounding circuits and the power distribution

   test vehicles using different power distribution topologies. One of them
   was based on a recently proposed power delivery method using power
   transmission lines (PTL). The other two were designed according to
   conventional power-ground plane pair approach. We show through
   measurement that PTL-based design provides less than -40dB of crosstalk
   between a signal line with multiple via-transitions and a nearby victim
   line. Measured data also showed that the PTL-based test vehicle had more
   than 68\% of power supply noise reduction as compared to conventional

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach for the uplink in a one-hop multi-gateway
   wireless packet network. In principle, the proposed technique applies to
   many types of low-power transmitters, including wireless sensors and
   RFID tags, both active and passive. Only when requested, each gateway
   node (or listener) forwards the compressed physical layer samples of
   packets to a server, which decodes the packets using
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques; this functionality
   could be described as selective application of multi-user MIMO with a
   distributed receiver array. Packets that have adequate SINR at a gateway
   are decoded, i.e., captured, and their waveforms are reconstructed and
   subtracted from stored samples; this subtraction is interference
   cancellation (IC). After IC, weaker packets may be revealed and decoded
   by the gateway, enabling successive IC (SIC). The diversity gain of
   multi-gateway reception provides higher SNR to packets that are not
   decodable at any gateway, thereby extending range. The spatial
   multiplexing capability of MIMO enables packets that have too much
   interference at the gateways to be decoded at the server, thereby
   supporting energy saving transmit-only strategies. The selectivity or
   ``on demand{''} feature lowers the fronthaul cost of sending samples to
   the server. This paper presents preliminary simulation and experimental
   performance results and overviews the various design concerns of On
   Demand Network MIMO, such as synchronization, spreading, SIC
   performance, gateway deployment, and medium access control (MAC).}},

Abstract = {{Distribution systems with active components, such as responsive load,
   distributed storage and renewables, supplemented with thermostatically
   controlled loads have the capability to support the transmission grid
   and provide part of the required capacity reserve. Including
   distribution system resources in transmission level multi-period
   economic dispatch is challenging due to the large number of devices. In
   this paper, a two-level scheme is proposed for optimally dispatching the
   distribution system's active \& reactive support to the grid, over a
   look-ahead horizon using an aggregate model. Initially, a semidefinite
   programming problem is solved in order to obtain a maximal dynamic
   ellipsoidal model of the feasible region for the power consumption of
   the distribution system. Subsequently, a look-ahead AC-OPF problem is
   solved for the optimal look-ahead dispatch of the transmission grid,
   using the aggregate distribution model. The distribution dispatch is
   then disaggregated to individual devices. The procedure is repeated in a
   receding horizon basis. Results on the accuracy and benefits of the
   approach are demonstrated on standard IEEE systems.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inertial properties and
   forces required to initiate movement on two different surfaces in a
   sample of three commonly prescribed gait trainers. Tests were conducted
   in a laboratory setting to compare the Prime Engineering KidWalk, Rifton
   Pacer, and Snug Seat Mustang with and without a weighted anthropometric
   test dummy configured to the weight and proportions of a 4-year-old
   child. The Pacer was the lightest and the KidWalk the heaviest while
   footprints of the three gait trainers were similar. Weight was borne
   fairly evenly on the four casters of the Pacer and Mustang while 85\% of
   the weight was borne on the large wheels of the mid-wheel drive KidWalk.
   These differences in frame style, wheel, and caster style and overall
   mass impact inertial properties and forces required to initiate
   movement. Test results suggest that initiation forces on tile were
   equivalent for the Pacer and KidWalk while the Mustang had the highest
   initiation force. Initiation forces on carpet were lowest for the
   KidWalk and highest for the Mustang. This initial study of inertia and
   movement initiation forces may provide added information for clinicians
   to consider when selecting a gait trainer for their clients.}},

Title = {{Influence of seed aerosol surface area and oxidation rate on vapor wall
   deposition and SOA mass yields: a case study with alpha-pinene
   ozonolysis}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{9361-9379}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory chambers, invaluable in atmospheric chemistry and aerosol
   formation studies, are subject to particle and vapor wall deposition,
   processes that need to be accounted for in order to accurately determine
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass yields. Although particle wall
   deposition is reasonably well understood and usually accounted for,
   vapor wall deposition is less so. The effects of vapor wall deposition
   on SOA mass yields in chamber experiments can be constrained
   experimentally by increasing the seed aerosol surface area to promote
   the preferential condensation of SOA-forming vapors onto seed aerosol.
   Here, we study the influence of seed aerosol surface area and oxidation
   rate on SOA formation in alpha-pinene ozonolysis. The observations are
   analyzed using a coupled vapor-particle dynamics model to interpret the
   roles of gas-particle partitioning (quasi-equilibrium vs. kinetically
   limited SOA growth) and alpha-pinene oxidation rate in influencing vapor
   wall deposition. We find that the SOA growth rate and mass yields are
   independent of seed surface area within the range of seed surface area
   concentrations used in this study. This behavior arises when the
   condensation of SOA-forming vapors is dominated by quasi-equilibrium
   growth. Faster alpha-pinene oxidation rates and higher SOA mass yields
   are observed at increasing O-3 concentrations for the same initial
   alpha-pinene concentration. When the alpha-pinene oxidation rate
   increases relative to vapor wall deposition, rapidly produced
   SOA-forming oxidation products condense more readily onto seed aerosol
   particles, resulting in higher SOA mass yields. Our results indicate
   that the extent to which vapor wall deposition affects SOA mass yields
   depends on the particular volatility organic compound system and can be
   mitigated through the use of excess oxidant concentrations.}},

   This control is only based on the existence of the uncertainty bound. A

Abstract = {{As one of the promising photovoltaic technologies, high performance
   metal-free dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been explored due to
   the fact that they can be potentially produced using low-cost materials,
   their color can be tuned and they exhibit reasonable stability. Here
   three new organic donor-acceptor-pi-acceptor (D-A-pi-A) sensitizers
   (B-87, Q-85 and Q-93), containing benzothiadiazole and two new modified
   pyrido{[}3,4-b]pyrazines as the auxiliary acceptor, have been
   synthesized and employed in DSSCs. Among the three dyes, B-87 and Q-85
   showed good photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies
   (PCE) up to 10.2\% and 10.0\%, respectively, which contribute to the few
   examples of DSSCs synthesized using pure organic dyes with an iodine
   electrolyte to exceed the 10\% efficiency barrier. It is noteworthy that
   an initial PCE of 7.16\% has been achieved for B-87 based DSSCs with an
   ionic liquid electrolyte, which retained 95\% of the initial efficiency
   after continuous light soaking for 1000 h at 60 degrees C, thus
   demonstrating outstanding stability. The molecular design strategy
   provides an effective approach to modulate the energy of the absorption
   bands as well as modify the optoelectronic and physical properties of
   the organic sensitizers to achieve highly efficient and stable
   sensitizers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report promising dielectric characteristics of iron
   oxide-deposited nanosized calcium copper titanate (nano
   CCTO-Fe3O4)/polyimide (PI) hybrid films induced by an external magnetic
   field. Nano CCTO particles with a pure perovskite cubic structure and
   without impurity phases were prepared, and then Fe3O4 nanoparticles were
   deposited as discrete units on the surface of CCTO to fabricate nano
   CCTO-Fe3O4 hybrid particles. The effects of magnetic field treatments on
   the dielectric properties of the composites were investigated in detail.
   The nano CCTO-Fe3O4/PI hybrid films annealed under an applied magnetic
   field exhibited a substantial increase in dielectric permittivity, a
   slight increase in dielectric loss, and a decrease in the percolation
   threshold. For the hybrid composites subjected to a magnetic field
   treatment for 30 min at 90 degrees C, a high dielectric permittivity of
   308 and relatively low dielectric loss of 0.60 at 100 Hz were
   simultaneously achieved when the content of nano CCTO-Fe3O4 was only 12
   vol\%. Such composites are promising for applications in electronic
   devices. The experimental results are well explained by percolation
   theory, which indicated that the enhanced dielectric properties of the
   hybrid films mainly originated from the large interfacial area and
   interfacial polarization induced by the external magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{We report on self-forming electrode modification by mixing
   2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorothiophenol (PFBT) directly into the solution of the
   organic semiconductor prior to film formation on top of existing metal
   electrodes. During the formation of the semiconductor layer from the
   mixed solution, PFBT chemisorbs on the underlying source/drain
   electrodes and modifies their electronic properties. The modification of
   evaporated silver, gold, or printed silver electrodes with PFBT is
   analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The use of this
   self-forming electrode modification is applied to solution-processed
   p-channel top-gate 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)
   pentacene/poly{[}bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] organic
   field-effect transistors (OFETs) that comprise bare silver or gold
   source/drain electrodes. The proposed new method simplifies device
   fabrication while yielding OFETs with a performance level that is
   comparable to that of reference devices in which the metal electrodes
   are modified with PFBT prior to the fabrication of the semiconductor
   layer.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous multicore processors have been suggested as alternative
   microarchitectural designs to enhance performance and energy efficiency.
   Using Amdahl's Law, heterogeneous models were primarily analyzed in
   performance and energy efficiency aspects to demonstrate its advantage
   over conventional homogeneous systems. In this paper, we further extend
   the study to understand the lifetime reliability consequences of
   heterogeneous multicore processors, as reliability becomes an
   increasingly important constraint. We present the lifetime reliability
   models of multicore processors based on Amdahl's Law, including compact
   thermal estimation that has strong correlation with device aging.
   Lifetime reliability is analyzed by varying i) core utilization
   (Amdahl's scaling factor), ii) processor composition (number of big and
   small cores), and iii) thread scheduling method. The study shows that
   the heterogeneous processor may have a serious reliability challenge. If
   the processor is comprised of only one big core and many small cores,
   stresses can be biased to the big core especially when workloads spend
   more time on sequential operations. Our study reveals that incorporating
   multiple big cores can mitigate reliability bottleneck in big cores and
   enhance processor lifetime, but adding too many big cores will have an
   adverse impact on lifetime reliability as well as performance.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental biology has traditionally relied on qualitative analyses;
   recently, however, as in other fields of biology, researchers have
   become increasingly interested in acquiring quantitative knowledge about
   embryogenesis. Advances in fluorescence microscopy are enabling
   high-content imaging in live specimens. At the same time, microfluidics
   and automation technologies are increasing experimental throughput for
   studies of multicellular models of development. Furthermore, computer
   vision methods for processing and analyzing bioimage data are now
   leading the way toward quantitative biology. Here, we review advances in
   the areas of fluorescence microscopy, microfluidics, and data analysis
   that are instrumental to performing high-content, high-throughput
   studies in biology and specifically in development. We discuss a case
   study of how these techniques have allowed quantitative analysis and
   modeling of pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo.}},

   the gradient matrix of the SAM image, and the statistical features are
   extracted and adopted for bump classification. The experimental results

   efficient. The low-cost and available cellulose paper (CP) was employed
   as flexible substrate loaded highly conductive current collect materials
   and electrochemical active materials. Results indicate that the
   as-fabricated electrode is sandwich-structured and flexible and the
   electrode itself is easy to be bended, twisted and rolled. The
   electrochemical data showed that the as-fabricated composite electrode
   displays excellent areal specific capacitance (2485 mF/cm(2) at scan
   rate of 5 mV/s) and the series resistance of the electrode was about 2.2
   Omega, which is relatively low enough to be used.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes optimal scheduling of largescale price-maker energy
   storage and revenue maximization for storage owners. With the
   penetration of storage eminent, the sizing and scheduling of the storage
   system must be studied to fully benefit from this enabling technology.
   Energy storage systems are attractive for providing various services to
   the electrical grid. Energy arbitrage, being one of them, enables
   electricity demand to be temporally decoupled from generation. While
   small-scale storage systems should be considered as price-taker,
   large-scale aggregated storage can affect the price by increasing and
   decreasing the required power on the generation side. Purchasing and
   selling power at the spot price can create a revenue based on the power
   transferred and the difference in price between two periods. The paper
   derives a dispatch schedule based on the current load and the forecasted
   average demand to maximize the storage owner's revenue and discusses the
   effect of size on price making mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{1371-1380}},
Abstract = {{Sustained release of anti-inflammatory agents remains challenging for
   small molecule drugs due to their low molecular weight and
   hydrophobicity. Therefore, the goal of this study was to control the
   release of a small molecule anti-inflammatory agent, crystal violet
   (CV), from hydrogels fabricated with heparin, a highly sulfated
   glycosaminoglycan capable of binding positively-charged molecules such
   as CV. In this system, both electrostatic interactions between heparin
   and CV and hydrogel degradation were tuned simultaneously by varying the
   level of heparin sulfation and varying the amount of dithiothreitol
   within hydrogels, respectively. It was found that heparin sulfation
   significantly affected CV release, whereby more sulfated heparin
   hydrogels (Hep and Hep(-N)) released CV with near zero-order release
   kinetics (R-squared values between 0.96-0.99). Furthermore, CV was
   released more quickly from fast-degrading hydrogels than slow-degrading
   hydrogels, providing a method to tune total CV release between 5-15 days
   while maintaining linear release kinetics. In particular, N-desulfated
   heparin hydrogels exhibited efficient CV loading (similar to 90\% of
   originally included CV), near zero-order CV release kinetics, and
   maintenance of CV bioactivity after release, making this hydrogel
   formulation a promising CV delivery vehicle for a wide range of
   inflammatory diseases.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{962-981}},
Abstract = {{The permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (PFSP) is a typical
   combinational and non-deterministic polynomial-hard problem, with
   discrete solution space. In this paper, a novel bacterial foraging
   optimisation algorithm (BFO) has been proposed to solve the PFSP.
   Difficulties such as slow convergent speeds and entrapment in the local
   optimum were incurred by the original BFO algorithm in solving a
   high-dimensional combinatorial optimisation problem. In order to deal
   with these difficulties, a differential evolution operator and a chaotic
   search operator were each introduced into the original BFO algorithm to
   enhance the activity levels of the individual bacterium and to extend
   the local searching space. Theoretical analysis showed that the improved
   algorithm obtained more motility in chemotaxis and could converge to the
   global optimum with a probability of 1. Simulation results and
   comparisons to both continuous and combinatorial benchmark problems were
   used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel optimisation
   algorithm.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{1709-1717}},
Abstract = {{The effects of process parameters on micro-texture evolution of Al alloy
   7075 in machining under extreme conditions were investigated. For the
   first time, the process parameters in machining are related to the
   micro-texture evolution below the machined surface, through a
   computational modeling framework verified by robust experimentation.
   Finite element analyses (FEA) were performed to obtain the mechanical
   loads that the material experiences due to chip removal. The
   viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) approach was used to follow the
   evolution in texture due to the applied loads. The most outstanding
   texture component, which was seen in the case of increased feed rate, is
   closely followed by the texture evolution model. The observed
   discrepancy in experimental and computational results of texture
   evolution in a few studied cases is believed to be due to the activation
   of other microstructural evolution phenomena rather than dislocation
   slip, as a result of the ultra-high levels of exerted strain and strain
   rates to the machined surface.}},

   Steel C250 Grinding}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{1763-1769}},
Abstract = {{In this study, maraging steel kinetics of both diffusion-controlled and
   diffusionless phase transitions under thermo-mechanical conditions was
   predicted using a physics-based model via the investigation of heating
   rate, stain rate, and contact zone temperature during grinding. It was
   assumed that high heating rate and high strain rate will affect phase
   transition. The theory of phase transition nucleation was combined with
   analysis of heating rate, stain rate, and contact zone temperature to
   predict phase transition during the grinding. The effects of heating
   rate and strain rate on phase transition were verified through maraging
   steel grinding experiments, X-ray diffractometry, and regression
   analyses. The results of post-grinding phase volume fractions of
   martensite and ferrite were compared with the results predicted from the
   neural network model, and models without consideration of heating rate
   or strain rate. Validation tests proved that the proposed physics-based
   model successfully predicted the occurrence and extent of phase
   transition associated with heating rate and strain rate. This
   physics-based model can be used to reduce phase transition during
   grinding of maraging steel, or to cause a predefined phase transition by
   controlling the thermo-mechanical loading.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a new type of resistive switching memory device that
   can be used in biodegradable electronic applications. The biodegradable
   device features magnesium difluoride as the active layer and iron and
   magnesium as the corresponding electrodes. This is the first report on
   magnesium difluoride as a resistive switching layer. With on-off ratios
   larger than one hundred, the device on silicon switches at voltages less
   than one volt and requires only sub-mA programming current. AC endurance
   of 103 cycles is demonstrated with +/- 1 V voltage pulses. The switching
   mechanism is attributed to the formation and rupture of conductive
   filaments comprising fluoride vacancies in magnesium difluoride. Devices
   fabricated on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate are tested
   for functionality, and degradation is subsequently demonstrated in
   de-ionized water. An additional layer of magnesium difluoride is used to
   hinder the degradation and extend the lifetime of the device.}},

   surface-enhanced Raman scattering via a plasmonic nanogap}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{15730-15736}},
Abstract = {{Electromagnetic and chemical enhancement mechanisms are commonly used to
   account for single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SM-SERS).
   Due to many practical limitations, however, the overall enhancement
   factor summed up from these two mechanisms is typically 5-6 orders of
   magnitude below the level of 10(14)-10(15) required for SM-SERS. Here,
   we demonstrate that the multiple elastic Rayleigh scattering of a
   molecule could play a critical role in further enhancing the Raman
   signal, when the molecule is trapped in a 2 nm gap between two Ag
   nanoparticles, pushing the overall enhancement factor close to the level
   needed for SM-SERS. As a universal physical process for all molecules
   interacting with light, we believe that Rayleigh scattering plays a
   pivotal and as yet unrecognized role in SERS, in particular, for
   enabling single-molecule sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{The animal kingdom is filled with amazing examples of coordinated
   locomotor and balance behavior. The intricate interaction of the
   neuromechanics of the combined skeletal, muscular, and neural systems
   that underlie these behaviors only adds to their impressiveness. To wit,
   the neuromechanics must deal with fantastically nonlinear dynamics,
   delayed and noisy sensory input, and multiple stability regimes in
   unpredictable environments. Because of these underlying complex
   interactions, an integrative systems approach is required to understand
   the performance of the locomotor and balance behavior that emerges. In
   this chapter, we propose the use of predictive modeling to facilitate
   the investigation of neuromechanics using our software platform,
   Neuromechanic. With this technique the dynamics of constituent
   neuromechanical systems are modeled and the resulting emergent behaviors
   studied; holistic behaviors are an output rather than an input for
   simulation. We describe three ways in which software can aid in a
   predictive approach to neuromechanical modeling: first, use of tools
   that emphasize control and optimization for predictive modeling; second,
   visualization and organization to aid in careful parameterization
   necessary to account for the variation found in biological specimens;
   third, building confidence in modeling results through the use of
   sensitivity analysis. We offer examples of these techniques using
   Neuromechanic, which is designed to simplify the prototyping of neural
   control strategies, formulate optimization criteria, visualize key
   parameters that effect model performance, and succinctly perform
   sensitivity analysis.}},

Series = {{Springer Series in Computational Neuroscience}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{197-223}},
Abstract = {{A goal and challenge in neuromechanical modeling is to develop validated
   simulations to predict the effects of neuromotor deficits and therapies
   on movements. This has been particularly challenging in balance and
   locomotion because they are inherently unstable, making it difficult to
   explore model parameters in a way that still coordinates the body in a
   functional way. Integrating realistic and validated musculoskeletal
   models with neural control mechanisms is critical to our ability to
   predict how human robustly move in the environment. Here we briefly
   review both human locomotion models, which generally focus on modeling
   the physical dynamics of movement with simplified models of neural
   control, as well as balance models, which model sensorimotor dynamics
   and processing with simplified biomechanical models. Combining complex
   neural and musculoskeletal models increases the redundancy in a model
   and allows us to study how motor variability and robustness are
   exploited to produce movements in both healthy and impaired individuals.
   To advance, the integration of neuromechanical modeling and experimental
   approaches will be critical in testing specific hypotheses concerning
   how and why neuromechanical flexibility is both exploited and
   constrained under various movement contexts. We give a few examples of
   how the close interplay between models and experiments can reveal
   neuromechanical principles of movement.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a three-phase interfacial system of a fuel cell is
   simulated using a multi-scale simulation approach consisting of quantum
   mechanical density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations.
   Through these simulations, the structural and transport properties of
   the three-phase system are investigated. The molecular interactions
   among the components of the three-phase interfacial system are examined
   by density functional theory and parameterized for potential energy
   functions of force field. First, we investigate the interactions of the
   Pt clusters with various molecules as a function of distance using the
   density functional theory method with dispersion correction. Based on
   the results of these calculations, a non-bonded interaction curve is
   built for each Pt-molecule pair. Such non-bonded interaction curves are
   reproduced by potential energy functions with optimized parameters.
   Based on these investigations, we develop a force field to describe the
   structures and transport properties of the Nafion-Pt-carbon (graphite)
   three-phase interfacial system using molecular dynamics simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain a finite element (FE) model that can more accurately
   describe structural behaviors, experimental data measured from the
   actual structure can be used to update the FE model. The process is
   known as FE model updating. In this paper, a frequency response function
   (FRF)-based model updating approach is presented. The approach attempts
   to minimize the difference between analytical and experimental FRFs,
   while the experimental FRFs are calculated using simultaneously measured
   dynamic excitation and corresponding structural responses. In this
   study, the FRF-based model updating method is validated through
   laboratory experiments on a four-story shear-frame structure. To obtain
   the experimental FRFs, shake table tests and impact hammer tests are
   performed. The FRF-based model updating method is shown to successfully
   update the stiffness, mass and damping parameters of the four-story
   structure, so that the analytical and experimental FRFs match well with
   each other.}},

Abstract = {{Multimodal vibration reduction can be obtained by coupling a mechanical
   structure to an electrical network approximating its modal properties.
   This strategy is applied to the control of a clamped plate with a 2D
   network of passive electrical components. The plate and the network are
   coupled through a periodic array of piezoelectric patches that enables
   the energy conversion. The network is experimentally implemented with
   inductors and transformers in order to create electrical resonances that
   present a spatial distribution approaching the first mode shapes of the
   plate. By tuning electrical resonances to mechanical ones, it becomes
   possible to introduce the equivalent of a tuned mass effect. This effect
   only occurs if the electrical and mechanical mode shapes are
   sufficiently close, which requires specific network topology and
   boundary conditions. Once the network is tuned, adding resistors
   introduces damping that can lead to a broadband vibration reduction of
   the plate. It is thus shown that a 2D control can be implemented with a

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{101-115}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient method named segmental multi-point
   linearization for accurate approximation of the sensitivity of failure
   probability with respect to design parameters. The method is established
   based on a piecewise linear fitting of the limit state surface and the
   analytical integral of the gradient of the failure probability with
   respect to parameters in the limit state function. The proposed method
   presents an attractive ratio of accuracy to computational cost. The
   general framework is scalable such that, by adjusting its complexity,
   different levels of accuracy can be achieved. The method is especially
   suitable to be implemented in gradient-based routines for solving
   reliability -based design optimization problems where accuracy of the
   parameter sensitivity is essential for convergence to an optimal
   solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Operations and Emissions Characteristics of Light-Duty Vehicles on Ramps}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2570}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Abstract = {{Ramps serve as the connections between restricted access highways and
   other road facilities, and considering the intensity of acceleration and
   deceleration occurring on ramps, the operation on ramps may contribute a
   significant amount of criteria-pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions
   from highway operation. In this study, second-by-second speed and
   position data were collected from 10 vehicles in the Detroit, Michigan,
   metropolitan area during their daily commute trips in 2012 using a
   portable activity measurement system. Ramp-associated operations were
   extracted from these measurements using ArcGIS, and emission rates were
   assigned based on model runs of the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator, or
   MOVES. In general, emissions of light-duty vehicles estimated for ramp
   operation are about two to three times higher than those for highway
   operation (excluding ramps) and local cycles with average speed levels
   higher than 30 mph. Emissions for interchange ramps are estimated to be
   similar to highway emissions. Accelerations occurring immediately after
   vehicles enter the highway from on-ramps contribute a large portion of
   emissions from ramp operations, since high-power operations are
   involved. This point applies especially to loop on-ramps, where the
   emission rate immediately after entering the highways tends to be higher
   than driving within the physical ramp itself. This research will be
   useful for understanding basic ramp operation characteristics and their
   emissions effects, and it will be important for development of ramp
   classification systems and generic ramp driving cycles, for emissions
   modeling and ramp hot-spot analysis.}},

Title = {{Estimating Project-Level Vehicle Emissions with Vissim and MOVES-Matrix}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2570}},
Pages = {{107-117}},
Abstract = {{Estimating transportation network emissions requires multiplying
   estimates of on-road vehicle activity (by source type and operating
   mode) by applicable emission rates for the observed source type and
   operating conditions. Coupling microsimulation model runs with emissions
   modeling can make fast assessments possible in transportation air
   quality planning. This research developed a tool with automated linkage
   between the Vissim microsimulation model and the Motor Vehicle Emission
   Simulator (MOVES) model. To link the two models, the research team used
   MOVES-Matrix, which was prepared by iteratively running MOVES across all
   possible iterations of vehicle source type, fuel, environmental and
   operating conditions, and other parameters (hundreds of millions of
   model runs) to create a multidimensional emission rate lookup matrix. A
   Vissim simulation of the major arterial roads and freeways at I-85 and
   Jimmy Carter Boulevard in Gwinnett County, Georgia, provided the case
   study for this MOVES-matrix application. The researchers present
   predicted emissions and the results of a sensitivity analysis to
   identify the potential impacts of various internal Vissim modeling
   parameters (such as minimum headway, maximum deceleration rate for
   cooperative braking, and emergency stop distance) on a case study's
   emissions outputs. The sensitivity analysis found that internal Vissim
   parameters impacted emissions and that proper care should be taken in
   using Vissim for emissions analysis at the corridor and link level. The
   case study demonstrates that Vissim coupled with MOVES-Matrix can be an
   effective tool for emissions analysis.}},

Title = {{Use of Three-Dimensional Pavement Surface Data to Analyze Crack
   Deterioration: Pilot Study on Georgia State Route 26}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2589}},
Pages = {{154-161}},
Abstract = {{Cracking is one of the predominant types of pavement surface distresses.
   The study of crack deterioration is important for establishing accurate
   pavement deterioration models and determining the timing of an adequate
   treatment method. It is also crucial to support the validation of the
   Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide. Although many efforts have
   been made in the laboratory or controlled environments to simulate the
   crack deterioration behavior, it is still difficult to fully model
   actual pavement crack deterioration behavior because of the complicated
   roadway conditions in the real-world environment. With the advance of
   sensing technology, it has become possible to collect detailed crack
   data in the field. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   feasibility of monitoring detailed crack deterioration behaviors in the
   field with the use of three-dimensional sensing technology, crack
   detection, and multiscale crack property extraction. This effort
   directly supports the study of multiscale crack deterioration behaviors.
   In this research, a pilot study was conducted on Georgia State Route 26,
   and the crack deterioration behaviors were monitored over 2 years.
   Analysis was conducted at the 1-mi segment level, the 100-ft section
   level, and the detailed crack level. The study shows promising results
   for observing and quantifying crack deterioration behaviors. The issues
   for analyzing long-term monitoring data are also discussed in this
   paper. Ultimately, the proposed method should be able to be used to
   support the development of a long-term performance forecasting model.}},

Title = {{Instrumentation and measurement strategy for the NOAA SENEX aircraft

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Natural emissions of ozone-and-aerosol-precursor gases such as isoprene
   and monoterpenes are high in the southeastern US. In addition,
   anthropogenic emissions are significant in the southeastern US and
   summertime photochemistry is rapid. The NOAA-led SENEX (Southeast Nexus)
   aircraft campaign was one of the major components of the Southeast
   Atmosphere Study (SAS) and was focused on studying the interactions
   between biogenic and anthropogenic emissions to form secondary
   pollutants. During SENEX, the NOAA WP-3D aircraft conducted 20 research
   flights between 27 May and 10 July 2013 based out of Smyrna, TN.
   Here we describe the experimental approach, the science goals and early
   results of the NOAA SENEX campaign. The aircraft, its capabilities and
   standard measurements are described. The instrument payload is
   summarized including detection limits, accuracy, precision and time
   resolutions for all gas-and-aerosol phase instruments. The
   inter-comparisons of compounds measured with multiple instruments on the
   NOAA WP-3D are presented and were all within the stated uncertainties,
   except two of the three NO2 measurements.
   The SENEX flights included day-and nighttime flights in the southeastern
   US as well as flights over areas with intense shale gas extraction
   (Marcellus, Fayetteville and Haynesville shale). We present one example
   flight on 16 June 2013, which was a daytime flight over the Atlanta
   region, where several crosswind transects of plumes from the city and
   nearby point sources, such as power plants, paper mills and landfills,
   were flown. The area around Atlanta has large biogenic isoprene
   emissions, which provided an excellent case for studying the
   interactions between biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. In this
   example flight, chemistry in and outside the Atlanta plumes was observed
   for several hours after emission. The analysis of this flight showcases
   the strategies implemented to answer some of the main SENEX science
   questions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new semi-automatic segmentation method for the
   prostate on 3D transrectal ultrasound images (TRUS) by combining the
   region and classification information. We use a random walk algorithm to
   express the region information efficiently and flexibly because it can
   avoid segmentation leakage and shrinking bias. We further use the
   decision tree as the classifier to distinguish the prostate from the
   non-prostate tissue because of its fast speed and superior performance,
   especially for a binary classification problem. Our segmentation
   algorithm is initialized with the user roughly marking the prostate and
   non-prostate points on the mid-gland slice which are fitted into an
   ellipse for obtaining more points. Based on these fitted seed points, we
   run the random walk algorithm to segment the prostate on the mid-gland
   slice. The segmented contour and the information from the decision tree
   classification are combined to determine the initial seed points for the
   other slices. The random walk algorithm is then used to segment the
   prostate on the adjacent slice. We propagate the process until all
   slices are segmented. The segmentation method was tested in 32 3D
   transrectal ultrasound images. Manual segmentation by a radiologist
   serves as the gold standard for the validation. The experimental results
   show that the proposed method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of
   91.37 +/- 0.05\%. The segmentation method can be applied to 3D
   ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and other applications.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of low concentrations of bacteria in food samples is a
   challenging process. Key to this process is the separation of the target
   from the food matrix. We demonstrate magnetic beads and magnetic
   micro-cilia based microfluidic mixing and capture, which are
   particularly useful for pre-concentrating the target. The first method
   we demonstrate makes use of magnetic microbeads held on to NiFe discs on
   the surface of the substrate. These beads are rotated around the
   magnetic discs by rotating the external magnetic field. The second
   method we demonstrate shows the use of cilia which extends into the
   fluid and is manipulated by a rotating external field. Magnetic
   micro-features were fabricated by evaporating NiFe alloy at room
   temperature, on to patterned photoresist. The high magnetic permeability
   of NiFe allows for maximum magnetic force on the features. The magnetic
   features were actuated using an external rotating magnet up to
   frequencies of 50Hz. We demonstrate active mixing produced by the
   microbeads and the cilia in a microchannel. Also, we demonstrate the
   capture of target species in a sample using microbeads.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymers, polymers composed of two or more homopolymers
   covalently bonded together, are currently being investigated as a method
   to extend optical lithography due to their ability to microphase
   separate on small size scales. In order to drive down the size that
   these BCPs phase separate, the BCPs with larger Flory-Huggin's chi
   parameter needs to be found. Typically these BCPs are composed of more
   dissimilar homopolymers. However, changing these interactions also
   changes how BCPs interact with their guiding underlayers. In this paper,
   several block copolymers are simulated annealing on chemoepitaxial
   guiding underlayers using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model in
   order to explore the effect that either energetic asymmetry or density
   asymmetry in the BCP have on the pattern registration. It is found that
   energetic asymmetry in BCPs causes one of the blocks to desire to skin,
   which shifts the composition of the background region that leads to well
   aligned vertical lamellae formation. It is hypothesized that moderate
   footing and undercutting at the underlayer or slight skinning at the
   free surface can increase the kinetics of defect annihilation by
   decreasing the distance that bridges must form. The density asymmetric
   BCPs simulated in this paper have different mechanical properties which
   lead to straighter sidewalls in the BCP film and potentially lead to
   better pattern registration. It is hypothesized that altering the
   compressibility of the blocks can alter equilibrium defectivity.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in system integration and packaging, the capabilities of
   hand-held devices and embedded bio-sensors have grown to a phenomenal
   scale. This in turn has led to a constant interaction between human
   beings and ambient electromagnetic waves. Hence there is a need for
   studying the effects of radiation on human physiology and also the
   performance of systems in such an environment. The system designers seek
   a full-wave solution of the entire system, taking into account a variety
   of environments in which it operates. However, attempts to do this
   substantially increase the complexities involved in computing full-wave
   solutions, especially when the problems involve multi-scale geometries
   with very fine features. For such problems, even the well-established
   numerical methods, such as the time domain technique finite difference
   time domain and the frequency domain techniques, e.g. the finite element
   method and the method of moments, are often challenged to the limits of
   their capabilities. In an attempt to address these challenges, we
   propose to handle the multiscale problems in three different ways, based
   on the dimension and the complexity of the fine features involved in the
   problem. Furthermore, we illustrate the efficacy of the above techniques
   via several examples, and the results obtained by the proposed
   techniques are compared with other existing numerical methods for the
   purpose of validation.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the degradation of the gamma/gamma' microstructure
   of single crystal Ni-base superalloy, CMSX-8, has been studied
   experimentally and computationally. Two microstructure evolution
   processes, referred to as rafting and coarsening, have been decoupled
   and investigated independently. The kinetics of coarsening and rafting
   of gamma' precipitates have been characterised using scanning electron
   microscopy for specimens at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1120
   degrees C and under stress levels of 25-360 MPa. A phenomenological
   relation describing rafting as a function of stress, temperature and
   time was fitted to experimental data. It was determined that coarsening
   of gamma' precipitates follows the LSW cube rate law and is controlled
   by a volume diffusion mechanism. The effective diffusivity which
   influences the ageing behaviour was estimated computationally using
   DICTRA software and the coarsening experimental results were verified by
   formulating and computing the effective activation energy in
   multicomponent systems.}},

Abstract = {{Single-crystal Ni-base superalloys are a favoured material for blades in
   the hot section of aero turbines. These materials exhibit excellent
   dimensional stability, deformation response and oxidation behaviour at
   higher temperatures, relative to other metals. Due to the high service
   temperatures and fluctuating loads experienced by turbine blades, a
   complete understanding of the material's oxidation and.' depletion
   kinetics is sought to characterise this aspect of the material's
   deformation response. This work provides the results and subsequent
   analysis of stress-free gamma' depletion tests performed on the
   single-crystal Ni-base superalloy PWA 1484. It was determined that the
   gamma' depletion kinetics of this material followed a sub-parabolic rate
   law. Furthermore, gamma' depletion kinetics were dependent upon surface
   roughness. Surface roughness can be an issue in practical application of
   oxidation principles and data. A relationship is developed, based on the
   literature and current work, which relates the stress-free gamma'
   depletion kinetics to exposure temperature, time and surface roughness.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization and Tabu Search for
   Distribution Network Reconfiguration}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the distribution network reconfiguration problem.
   A hybrid algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and tabu search
   (TS) is proposed as the searching algorithm. The new algorithm shares
   the advantages of PSO and TS, which has a fast computation speed and a
   strong ability to avoid local optimal solution. After a thorough
   comparison, network random key (NRK) is introduced as the corresponding
   coding strategy among various tree representation strategies. NRK could
   completely avoid the generation of infeasible solutions during the
   searching process and has a good locality property, which allows the new
   hybrid algorithm to perform to its fullest potential. The proposed
   algorithm has been validated through an IEEE 33 bus test case. Compared
   with other algorithms, the proposed method is both accurate and
   computationally efficient. Furthermore, a test to solve another problem
   also proves the robustness of the proposed algorithm for a different
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Outsourcing of chip manufacturing to untrusted foundries and using third
   party IPs in design, have opened the possibility of inserting malicious
   hardware Trojans into the circuit. As excitation of Trojan is extremely
   rare, it is almost impossible to detect Trojans with functional logic
   testing. We need to detect Trojans without actually activating it (side
   channel analysis). Hardware Trojan circuit get inputs from low
   transition probability nodes of the original circuit. Tapping of these
   nodes for creating Trojan inputs increase capacitive load at those
   nodes. We have developed a very high resolution pulse propagation
   technique to capture this extra capacitance at Trojan affected nodes.
   This technique provides 20-25X higher diagnostic resolution than path
   delay analysis in the presence of significant manufacturing process
   variation. Pulse propagation based Trojan detection is independent of
   logic depth in the path. As the logic depth increases other state of the
   art Trojan detection schemes loses accuracy. Though the scheme appears
   simple, it is not so straight forward to generate and apply the pulse
   inputs on chip at the desired locations and capture them at designated
   locations with high accuracy in presence of high fan out nodes in the
   design. We have developed a very high resolution current sensing scheme
   to detect pulse propagation through logic gates. A single sensor can
   sense pulse at multiple locations. The entire scheme of pulse based
   Trojan detection has been integrated into JTAG boundary scan scheme with
   minimal area overhead to provide a complete solution for Hardware
   Trojans.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid NiMoO4/rGO composite was successfully synthesized by a facile
   one-pot hydrothermal method. A series of characterization techniques:
   SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were
   used to verify the special nanostructure and unique composition of the
   as-prepared products, in which the NiMoO4 nanowires are homogenously
   distributed in the interconnected rGO network, and at the same time the
   NiMoO4 nanowires are encapsulated within the rGO sheets, further
   preventing the rGO nanosheets from agglomerating and restacking. As an
   electrode material for pseudocapacitors, the NiMoO4/rGO composite
   exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 1202 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1),
   and still remained as high as 775 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1) and 592 F g(-1)
   at 20 A g(-1), which are superior to those of pure NiMoO4 nanowires. The
   enhanced capacitive performance of the as-prepared NiMoO4/rGO composite
   is closely related to the form of an internal mesoporous structure by
   utilizing the high electrical conductivity and large surface area of rGO
   nanosheets, which could provide more electroactive sites, a larger
   electrode-electrolyte contact area and accelerate effective ion and
   electron transport in the whole electrode. The results suggest that such
   a hybrid electrode has great potential applications in high performance
   energy-storage systems.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive immune response consists of many highly regulated, multistep
   cascades that protect against infection while preserving the health of
   autologous tissue. The proper initiation, maintenance, and resolution of
   such responses require the precise coordination of molecular and
   cellular signaling over multiple time and length scales orchestrated by
   lymphatic transport. In order to investigate these functions and
   manipulate them for therapy, a comprehensive understanding of how
   lymphatics influence immune physiology is needed. This review presents
   the current mechanistic understanding of the role of the lymphatic
   vasculature in regulating biomolecule and cellular transport from the
   interstitium, peripheral tissue immune surveillance, the lymph node
   stroma and microvasculature, and circulating lymphocyte homing to lymph
   nodes. This review also discusses the ramifications of lymphatic
   transport in immunity as well as tolerance and concludes with examples
   of how lymphatic-mediated targeting of lymph nodes has been exploited
   for immunotherapy applications.}},

Title = {{A New Parallel Method for Binary Black Hole Simulations}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Simulating binary black hole (BBH) systems are a computationally
   intensive problem and it can lead to great scientific discovery. How to
   explore more parallelism to take advantage of the large number of
   computing resources of modern supercomputers is the key to achieve high
   performance for BBH simulations. In this paper, we propose a scalable
   MPM (Mesh based Parallel Method) which can explore both the inter-and
   intramesh level parallelism to improve the performance of BBH
   simulation. At the same time, we also leverage GPU to accelerate the
   performance. Different kinds of performance tests are conducted on
   BlueWaters. Compared with the existing method, our MPM can improve the
   performance from 5x speedup (compared with the normalized speed of 32
   MPI processes) to 8x speedup. For the GPU accelerated version, our MPM
   can improve the performance from 12x speedup to 28x speedup.
   Experimental results also show that when only enough CPU computing
   resource or limited GPU computing resource is available, our MPM can
   employ two special scheduling mechanisms to achieve better performance.
   Furthermore, our scalable GPU acceleration MPM can achieve almost ideal
   weak scaling up to 2048 GPU computing nodes which enables our software
   to handle even larger BBH simulations efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Plate-like components are widely used in numerous automotive, marine,
   and aerospace applications where they can be employed as host structures
   for vibration based energy harvesting. Piezoelectric patch harvesters
   can be easily attached to these structures to convert the vibrational
   energy to the electrical energy. Power output investigations of these
   harvesters require accurate models for energy harvesting performance
   evaluation and optimization. Equivalent circuit modeling of the
   cantilever-based vibration energy harvesters for estimation of
   electrical response has been proposed in recent years. However,
   equivalent circuit formulation and analytical modeling of multiple
   piezo-patch energy harvesters integrated to thin plates including
   nonlinear circuits has not been studied. In this study, equivalent
   circuit model of multiple parallel piezoelectric patch harvesters
   together with a resistive load is built in electronic circuit simulation
   software SPICE and voltage frequency response functions (FRFs) are
   validated using the analytical distributed-parameter model. Analytical
   formulation of the piezoelectric patches in parallel configuration for
   the DC voltage output is derived while the patches are connected to a
   standard AC-DC circuit. The analytic model is based on the equivalent
   load impedance approach for piezoelectric capacitance and AC-DC circuit
   elements. The analytic results are validated numerically via SPICE
   simulations. Finally, DC power outputs of the harvesters are computed
   and compared with the peak power amplitudes in the AC output case.}},

Abstract = {{The harvesting of mechanical strain and kinetic energy has received
   great attention over the past two decades in order to power wireless
   electronic components such as those used in passive and active
   monitoring applications. Piezoelectric ceramics, such as PZT (lead
   zirconate titanate), constitute the most commonly used electromechanical
   interface in vibration energy harvesters. However, there are
   applications in which piezoelectric ceramics cannot be used due to their
   low allowable curvature and brittle nature. Soft polymer PVDF
   (polyvinylidene fluoride) is arguably the most popular non-ceramic soft
   piezoelectric energy harvester material for such scenarios. Another type
   of polymer that has received less attention is PP (polypropylene) for
   electret-based energy harvesting using the thickness mode (33-mode).
   This work presents figure of merit comparison of PP versus PVDF for
   off-resonant energy harvesting in thickness mode operation, revealing
   substantial advantage of PP over PVDF. For thickness-mode energy
   harvesting scenarios (e.g. dynamic compression) at reasonable ambient
   vibration frequencies, the figure of merit for the maximum power output
   is proportional to the square of the effective piezoelectric strain
   constant divided by the effective permittivity constant. Under optimal
   conditions and for the same volume, it is shown that PP can generate
   more than two orders of magnitude larger electrical power as compared to
   PVDF due to the larger effective piezoelectric strain constant and lower
   permittivity of the former.}},

   the implicit assumption that design alternatives are independent can
   lead to a sub-optimal selection. This paper provides a simplified
   example of the NIDDM problem, and uses this to define the conditions
   where the NIDDM problem arises. An aerospace design toolset is then used
   to explore the NIDDM problem in realistic conditions, and a discussion
   is presented about when traditional robust design processes are
   appropriate or an alternative design methodology is needed.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown by several research groups over the past few years
   that vibration energy harvesters with intentionally designed nonlinear
   stiffness components can be used for frequency bandwidth enhancement
   under harmonic excitation for sufficiently strong vibration amplitudes.
   In order to overcome the need for high excitation intensities that are
   required to exploit nonlinear dynamic phenomena, we have developed an
   M-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester configuration that can exhibit a
   nonlinear frequency response under low vibration levels. This
   configuration is made from a continuous bent spring steel with
   piezoelectric laminates and a proof mass, and no magnetic components.
   Careful design of this nonlinear architecture that minimizes
   piezoelectric softening further enables the possibility of achieving the
   jump phenomenon in hardening at base acceleration levels on the order of
   a few milli-g. In the present work, such a design is explored for both
   primary and secondary resonance excitations at different vibration
   levels and for different electrical loads. Following the primary
   resonance excitation case that offers more than 600 \% increase in the
   half-power bandwidth as compared to the linear system at a
   root-mean-square excitation level as low as 0.04g, secondary resonance
   behavior is investigated with a focus on 1:2 and 1:3 superharmonic
   resonance neighborhoods. A multi-term harmonic balance formulation is
   employed for a computationally effective yet high-fidelity analysis of
   this high-quality-factor system with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities.
   In addition to primary resonance and secondary (superharmonic) resonance
   cases, multi-harmonic excitation is modeled and experimentally
   validated.}},

Abstract = {{When crane payloads are lifted off the ground, the payload may
   unexpectedly swing sideways. This occurs when the hoist cables are at an
   angle relative to vertical and the payload is not directly beneath the
   hoist. Because the hoist point is far above the payload, it is difficult
   for crane operators to know if the hoist cable is perfectly vertical
   before they start to lift the payload. Some amount of horizontal motion
   of the payload will always occur at lift off. If an off-centered lift
   results in significant horizontal motion, then it creates a hazard for
   the human operators, the payload, and the surrounding environment. This
   paper develops dynamic models of off-centered lifts and presents
   experimental verification of the theoretical predictions. To mitigate
   the detrimental effects of off-centered lifts, autonomous-centering

Abstract = {{Macro-fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric structures with interdigitated
   electrodes can be used for effective hydrodynamic thrust generation by
   underwater actuation as well as low-power electricity production from
   underwater vibrations for powering wireless electronic components. In
   order to develop high-fidelity models to predict the electrohydroelastic
   dynamics of MFC structures, mixing rules based electroelastic mechanics
   modeling is coupled with the global electroelastic dynamics based on the
   Euler-Bernoulli kinematics and the nonlinear fluid loading based on
   Morison's semi-empirical model. The focus is placed on the dynamic
   actuation problem for the first two bending vibration modes under
   geometrically, materially, and piezoelectrically linear,
   hydrodynamically nonlinear behavior. The electroelastic and dielectric
   properties of a representative volume element (piezoelectric fiber and
   epoxy matrix) between two subsequent interdigitated electrodes are
   correlated to physical parameters of MFC bimorphs and validated for
   different MFC types that have the same overhang length but different
   widths. Following the process of in-air electroelastic model development
   and validation, underwater experiments are conducted for different
   length-to-width aspect ratios (Lib), and empirical drag and inertia
   coefficients are extracted for Morison's equation. The repeatability of
   these empirical coefficients is demonstrated for experiments conducted
   using aluminum cantilevers of different aspect ratios. Convergence of
   the nonlinear electrohydroelastic Euler-Bernoulli-Morison model to its
   hydrodynamically linear counterpart with increased L/b values is also
   reported. The proposed model, its harmonic balance analysis, and
   experimental results can be used for parameter identification as well as
   aspect ratio optimization for underwater piezoelectric actuation,
   sensing, and energy harvesting problems.}},

Abstract = {{The design of isolation mounts is of critical importance in the
   protection of structures and sensitive equipment from damage or failure.
   Simultaneous protection from both shock and vibration is particularly
   challenging because of the broadband nature of the input signal and
   because of the deleterious effect of damping on high-frequency
   isolation. Prior work by the authors has shown that chains of
   translating mass/spring elements can act as a ``mechanical filter{''}
   for input disturbances. However, in finite-length chains, wave
   reflections can result in secondary pulses that hit the structure and
   can diminish the effectiveness of the isolator. In this paper, a new
   type of isolator is developed that converts translational input forces
   into a combination of translational and rotational motion. If designed
   correctly, the rotational motion can be managed so that it does not
   result in additional forces transmitted to the structure. In effect, the
   isolator is able to trap some of the input energy into rotational
   vibration, preventing it from reaching the structure. Parametric
   simulation studies are conducted as various system parameters are
   varied.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of a chain of springs and masses to reduce
   the transmission of shock and vibration through the system. The masses
   are equipped with internally rotating masses that absorb some of the
   axial vibration into internal kinetic energy of the masses. The internal
   masses have viscous damping, but no elastic or gravitational restraint.
   Previous research has shown that a single cart system attached to a
   vibrating structure can help mitigate shock through targeted energy
   transfer. This paper examines the potential for shock isolation provided
   by a chain of such systems. Through numerical simulations, tradeoffs are
   examined between displacement and transmitted force.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the contributing factors for wrong-way crashes on
   freeways based on information available from crash databases and crash
   reports, causal tables and a Haddon matrix are used to analyze fatal and
   injury-related crashes caused by wrong-way driving from 2004 to 2009 in
   Illinois. For the first step, causal tables are generated based on the
   police crash reports, in which the percentage of crashes caused by each
   factor is calculated. Based on these percentages, the contributing
   factors are ranked. Next, a Haddon matrix is developed for each
   wrong-way crash in which different factors are identified separately for
   periods before, during, and after the crash. These factors include
   drivers' age, drivers' condition, crash causes, vehicle types, vehicle
   maneuvers, roadway conditions, weather, and wrong-way entry points. For
   a crash with multiple contributing factors, a weighted point is
   calculated and assigned to each factor. The total points for each factor
   are used to rank the order of all contributing factors. Furthermore, a
   significance test is used to analyze the statistical significance of
   each of those factors. The analysis results indicate that alcohol
   impairment, darkness, and driver's age and skill are among the top
   contributing factors for wrong-way crashes.}},

Abstract = {{Optical inspection is a non-destructive quality monitoring technique to
   detect defects in manufactured parts. Automating the defect detection,
   by application of image processing, prevents the presence of human
   operators making the inspection more reliable, reproducible and faster.
   In this paper, a background subtraction technique, based on
   morphological operations, is proposed. The low-computational load
   associated with the used morphological operations makes this technique
   more computationally effective than background subtraction techniques
   such as spline approximation and surface-fitting. The performance of the
   technique is tested by applying to detect defects in a weld seam with
   non-uniform intensity distribution where the defects are precisely
   segmented. The proposed background subtraction technique is
   generalizable to sheet, surface, or part defect detection in various
   applications of manufacturing.}},

Title = {{An upright eyedrop bottle: accuracy, usage of excess drops, and
   contamination compared to a conventional bottle}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1411-1417}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study tested the feasibility of using an upright eyedrop
   bottle (UEB), a device designed to assist patients with eyedrop
   placement without reclining their head.
   Patients and methods: Experienced eyedrop users were enrolled who
   answered ``yes{''} to the question, ``Do you ever have trouble getting
   your eyedrops in?{''} After being shown a multimedia presentation and
   answering a questionnaire regarding eyedrop usage, participants were
   observed instilling eyedrops. Participants were instructed to instill a
   single eyedrop in each eye with both a standard bottle and the UEB. They
   repeated this process three times. With each trial, the amount of time
   taken to instill drops was recorded, as well as whether a drop landed in
   the eye (accuracy), if excess drops were used, and if the bottle tip was
   contaminated.
   Results: Forty participants were enrolled, with an average age of 72.4
   +/- 8.9 years; the majority were females (24 females). Thirty-four
   participants had been using eyedrops for at least 1 year. The time
   required to instill eyedrops was significantly less with the UEB in the
   second and third trials. There was no difference in accuracy between the
   conventional bottle and the UEB in the left or right eye in any trials.
   Significantly more participants used excess number of drops while using
   the conventional bottle in both the left and right eyes in all three
   trials. The bottle tip was never contaminated with the UEB. Depending on
   the trial and the eye, the conventional bottle was contaminated by
   between 42\% and 53\% of participants.
   Conclusion: The UEB has the potential to assist patients with eyedrop
   placement. Although there was no difference in accuracy between the UEB
   and the conventional bottle, the UEB was associated with less use of
   excess drops and less contamination of the bottle tip, compared to the
   conventional bottle.}},

Abstract = {{Two-wheeled inverted pendulums can be used as personal transporters.
   Their maneuverability and small footprint give them some desirable
   properties for this application. However; given the unstable mechanical
   design and the complicated control system that is required, inverted
   pendulums make complex and unexpected motions in response to both
   movements of the rider and disturbances from the operating environment.
   These complex motions lead to dynamic hazards that may cause the rider
   to fall off or the device to fall over. To better understand some of the
   complex motions, the response of a two-wheeled inverted-pendulum
   transporter traveling over bumps of various sizes is studied. Three
   effects of riding over bumps are demonstrated through an experimental
   investigation. When striking a bump, the transporter may bounce in the
   vertical direction, depending on the approach speed and size of the
   bump. Bumps also cause the transporter to pitch forward. When striking a
   bump with one wheel, the transporter turns towards the bump. All three
   effects can act to destabilize the machine and rider.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum resin infusion has been developed as a low-cost process for
   manufacturing fiber-reinforced composites with high fiber loading.
   However, it is an extremely slow process due to the long time required
   to prepare a vacuum-tight mold and further to cure the resin at room
   temperature. In this work, a new mold with a rubber cushion suitable for
   rapid infusion and rapid curing under complete negative pressure was
   designed and fabricated. Experimental results demonstrated that the new
   mold is suitable for rapid heating and withstand dynamic loading under
   complete vacuum force. Composite plaques can be produced with a short
   cycle time of several minutes while desired mechanical properties are
   still achieved. Thermal analysis and rheological measurements were
   performed to study epoxy curing at elevated temperatures and define an
   optimal process window for rapid vacuum infusion. This study leads to
   the development of a completely vacuum-based liquid molding process that
   uses simple tooling, yet is suitable for rapid production.

   (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The XRD
   results indicate that with the introduction of pullulan, the interaction
   between SF and pullulan in the blend films induced the conformation
   transition of SF films and amorphous phase increases with increasing
   pullulan ratio. The thermal properties of the blend films were improved
   significantly in the blend films.}},

Abstract = {{Many educators agree that developing an interdisciplinary design
   curriculum is critical in creating the next generation of design
   professionals. However, literature surrounding the pedagogical
   challenges to undergraduate interdisciplinary design courses is limited.
   In this paper we study the initial challenges in developing and
   delivering an interdisciplinary design course. We observe from the
   perspective of the educators and the students in a newly synthesized
   co-taught design course that combines both architecture and engineering
   disciplines.
   Through exploratory observations and analysis of student and instructor
   feedback throughout the semester, our findings suggest that disciplinary
   boundaries often influence pedagogical styles despite a concerted effort
   to create an interdisciplinary course that focuses on design. Despite
   agreement to interdisciplinary design teaching through shared lectures
   and activities, individual teaching methods varied, impacted by
   pedagogical norms from their respective disciplines. In response,
   students had mixed reactions to the varying presentation methods and
   critique feedback. This study, while preliminary in assessment, raises
   many questions about the challenges of teaching interdisciplinary design
   courses.}},

Abstract = {{Although work related to mechanical advantage of compliant mechanisms
   has been presented almost two decades ago, unlike many rigid-body
   mechanism systems, this performance measure has seldom been used. In
   great part, the reasons are attributed to, one, the relatively recent
   development of and a lack of familiarity with this technology and, two,
   the complexity of the understanding and evaluation of mechanical
   advantage of compliant systems. In an effort to simplify the evaluation,
   this. work uses the pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) of a compliant
   mechanism, along with traditional notions of power conservation and
   angular velocity ratios using instant centers. As a first step, the
   inherent compliance in the mechanism is neglected in determining its
   mechanical advantage, followed by considerations to optimize its
   structural configuration for enhancing its mechanical advantage. The
   PRBM methodology, which offers us a way to estimate the characteristic
   compliance of the mechanism, now enables its inclusion in determining
   the mechanical advantage of the compliant mechanism. Two significant
   factors affecting it are i) the structural configuration of the PRBM,
   and ii) the energy stored in compliant elements of the mechanism.
   Several case studies are presented, which suggest that minimizing the
   latter contribution relative to that of an optimized structural
   configuration may improve the mechanical advantage of a compliant
   mechanism. Nonetheless, its effect on the mechanical advantage cannot be
   neglected.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an effective engineered rehabilitation system for
   understanding and inducing functional recovery of hemiparetic limbs
   based on the concept of timing-dependent induction of neural plasticity.
   Limb motor function is commonly impaired after neurologic injury such as
   stroke, with hemiparesis being one of the major impairments. In an
   emerging unique intervention for hemiparesis, named repetitive
   facilitation exercise, or RFE, a therapist manually applies brief
   mechanical stimuli to the peripheral target muscles (e.g., tapping,
   stretching of tendon/muscle) immediately before a patient intends to
   produce a movement with the muscle. The practice of this rehabilitation
   procedure by a skilled therapist often leads to dramatic rehabilitation
   outcomes. However, unskilled therapists, most likely due to the
   inaccuracy of the timing of peripheral stimulation in reference to the
   intention of movement (i.e. motor command), are unable to recreate the
   same rehabilitation results. Robotic rehabilitation, on the other hand,
   can improve the reliability and efficacy of the operation by satisfying
   the timing precision required by the therapy. This study demonstrates
   the use of a pneumatically driven MRI-compatible robot for RFE
   assessment. The pressure dynamics of the system is studied for an
   accurate estimation on the time of response of the robot. The required
   temporal precision of the therapy is obtained and the use of the device
   is validated through experiments on a human subject.}},

   Two candidate metal oxides are investigated against six candidate lining
   materials. XRD results for both the materials are investigated and

   in the presence of lining material. It is found that the lining material
   rich in zirconia is suitable for such application. Silicon Carbide is

Abstract = {{This paper builds on studies conducted on thermal energy storage (TES)
   systems that were built as a part of the work performed for a DOE-funded
   SunShot project titled ``High Temperature Falling Particle Receiver{''}.
   In previous studies, two small-scale TES systems were constructed for
   measuring heat loss at high temperatures that are compatible with the
   falling particle receiver concept, both of which had shown very limited
   heat loss. Through the course of those studies, it became evident that
   there was a lack of information about the thermal performance of some of
   the insulating refractory materials used in the experiments at high
   temperatures, especially insulating firebrick and perlite concrete. This
   work focuses on determining the thermal conductivities of those
   materials at high temperatures. The apparatus consists of a prototype
   cylindrical TES bin built with the same wall construction used in
   previous studies. An electric heater is placed along the centerline of
   the bin, and thermocouples are used to measure temperature at the
   interfaces between all layers. Heat loss is measured across one of the
   layers whose thermal conductivity had already been well established
   using laboratory experiments. This value is used to deduce the thermal
   conductivity of other layers. Three interior temperature levels were
   considered; namely, 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 700 degrees C.
   Results show that the thermal conductivity of insulating firebrick
   remains low (approximately 0.22 W/m.K) at an average layer temperature
   as high as 640 degrees C, but it was evident that the addition of mortar
   had an impact on its effective thermal conductivity. Results also show
   that the thermal conductivity of perlite concrete is very low,
   approximately 0.15 W/m.K at an average layer temperature of 360 degrees
   C. This is evident by the large temperature drop that occurs across the
   perlite concrete layer. These results should be useful for future
   studies, especially those that focus on numerical modeling of TES bins.}},

Abstract = {{The equivalent circuit modeling of the vibration-based energy harvesters
   for accurate estimation of electrical response has drawn much attention
   over the recent years. Different methods have been proposed to obtain
   the equivalent circuit parameters using analytical and finite element
   models of the piezoelectric energy harvesters. In such methods, the
   structure is a typical cantilever beam with piezoelectric layers under
   base excitation. As an alternative to beams, piezoelectric patch-based
   harvesters attached to thin plates can be considered due to the wide use
   of plate-like structures in automotive, marine and aerospace
   applications. Considering these needs, a multi-mode equivalent circuit
   model of a piezoelectric energy harvester integrated to a thin plate is
   developed in this study. Equivalent circuit parameters are obtained from
   analytical distributed parameter model of the harvester which covers the
   electromechanical coupling behavior of the piezoelectric patch and
   vibration of the host plate. The multi-mode circuit representation of
   the harvester is built via electronic circuit simulation software SPICE.
   Using the SPICE software, electrical outputs of the piezoelectric energy
   harvester connected to linear and nonlinear circuit elements are
   computed. Simulation results are then validated for the standard AC-AC
   and AC-DC configurations. For the AC configuration, voltage Frequency
   Response Functions (FRFs) are calculated for various resistive loads and
   they exhibit excellent agreement with the published analytical
   closed-form solution. For the full wave rectifier configuration,
   simulation results of the DC voltage and power outputs are calculated
   for a wide range of load resistance values and compared with the
   analytical single mode expression of the harvester in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation of waste vibration energy into low power electricity
   has been heavily researched to enable self sustained wireless electronic
   components. Monostable and bistable nonlinear oscillators have been
   explored by several researchers in an effort to enhance the frequency
   bandwidth of operation. Linear two degree of freedom (2-DOF)
   configurations as well as combination of a nonlinear singleDOF harvester
   with a linear oscillator to constitute a nonlinear 2-DOF harvester have
   also been explored to develop broadband energy harvesters. In the
   present work, the concept of nonlinear internal resonance in a
   continuous frame structure is explored for broadband energy harvesting.
   The L-shaped beam-mass structure with quadratic nonlinearity was
   formerly studied in the nonlinear dynamics literature to demonstrate
   modal energy exchange and the saturation phenomenon when carefully tuned
   for two-to-one internal resonance. In the current effort, piezoelectric
   coupling is introduced, and electromechanical equations of the L-shaped
   energy harvester are employed to explore the primary resonance behaviors
   around the first and the second linear natural frequencies for bandwidth
   enhancement. Simulations using approximate analytical frequency response
   equations as well as time-domain numerical solutions reveal that 2-DOF
   configuration with quadratic and two-to-one internal resonance could
   extend the bandwidth enhancement capability. Both electrical power and
   shunted vibration frequency response curves of steady-state solutions
   are explored in detail. Effects of various electromechanical system
   parameters, such as piezoelectric coupling and load resistance, on the
   overall dynamics of the internal resonance energy harvesting system are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-inspired hydrodynamic thrust generation using piezoelectric
   transduction has recently been explored using Macro-Fiber Composite
   (MFC) actuators. The MFC technology strikes a balance between the
   actuation force and structural deformation levels for effective swimming
   performance, and additionally offers geometric scalability, silent
   operation, and ease of fabrication. Recently we have shown that mean
   thrust levels comparable to biological fish of similar size can be
   achieved using MFC fins. The present work investigates the effect of
   length-to-width (L/b) aspect ratio on the hydrodynamic thrust generation
   performance of MFC cantilever fins by accounting for the power
   consumption level. It is known that the hydrodynamic inertia and drag
   coefficients are controlled by the aspect ratio especially for L/b<5.
   The three MFC bimorph fins explored in this work have the aspect ratios
   of 2.1, 3.9, and 5.4. A nonlinear electrohydroelastic model is employed
   to extract the inertia and drag coefficients from the vibration response
   to harmonic actuation for the first bending mode. Experiments are then
   conducted for various actuation voltage levels to quantify the mean
   thrust resultant and power consumption levels for different aspect
   ratios. Variation of the thrust coefficient of the MFC fins with aspect
   ratio is also modeled and validated.}},

Abstract = {{The severe plastic deformation of metals leads to the formation of
   nanotextured surfaces as well as the retention of significant strain
   energy, characteristics which are known to promote catalytic activity.
   Here, we demonstrate plastically deformed surfaces of copper and
   copper-based alloys as being highly catalytic using the well-studied
   model catalytic reaction which reduces 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by
   borohydride. Among the materials studied, the most catalytically active
   is formed in a two-step process where metal chips are mechanically
   sheared from a Cu-Sn alloy containing precipitates and then exposed to
   an etchant which removes the precipitates from the exposed surface. The
   so-formed structures exhibit exceedingly high catalytic activity and set
   new benchmarks when incorporated into a fixed-bed reactor. The formation
   of catalytically active sites is shown to be strongly dependent on the
   presence of the precipitates during the deformation process, achieving
   an order of magnitude increase in the reaction rate constant when
   compared to similarly formed Cu-Sn catalysts lacking these precipitates.
   The work, therefore, demonstrates a new approach for generating
   catalytically active sites which may be applicable to other alloy
   combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Simulating phase transformation of materials at the atomistic scale
   requires the knowledge of saddle points on the potential energy surface
   (PES). In the existing first principles saddle point search methods, the
   requirement of a large number of expensive evaluations of potential
   energy, e.g. using density functional theory (DFT), limits the
   application of such algorithms to large systems. Thus, it is meaningful
   to minimize the number of functional evaluations as DFT simulations
   during the search process. Furthermore, model-form uncertainty and
   numerical errors are inherent in DFT and search algorithms. Robustness
   of the search results should be considered. In this paper, a new search
   algorithm based on Kriging is presented to search local minima and
   saddle points on a PES efficiently and robustly. Different from existing
   searching methods, the algorithm keeps a memory of searching history by
   constructing surrogate models and uses the search results on the
   surrogate models to provide the guidance of future search on the PES.
   The surrogate model is also updated with more DFT simulation results.
   The algorithm is demonstrated by the examples of Rastrigin and Schwefel
   functions with a multitude of minima and saddle points.}},

Abstract = {{In vision-based measurement, there is a lack of effective methods for
   local contour matching of flexible automotive rubber product contour due

   point set matching method based on a geometric descriptor. A geometric
   descriptor of a local point set includes shape properties of the point
   set and position information. In local matching process, the geometric
   descriptor of a standard point set is extracted and a tolerable
   geometric descriptor for a desired point set is also generated through
   adding more factors to the standard descriptor. According to the
   generated tolerable descriptor, an angle similarity optimization
   searching is used to find the best matched local point set within a
   constrained position limit. This method has been implemented in a
   sealing strip cross-section measurement system, and several
   cross-section profiles of automotive sealing strips have been tested.
   The results show the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method
   and this method can lead to an automated measurement for flexible

Abstract = {{In modeling and simulation, model-form uncertainty arises from the lack
   of knowledge and simplification during modeling process and numerical
   treatment for ease of computation. Traditional uncertainty
   quantification approaches are based on assumptions of stochasticity in
   real, reciprocal, or functional spaces to make them computationally
   tractable. This makes the prediction of important quantities of interest
   such as rare events difficult. In this paper, a new approach to capture
   model-form uncertainty is proposed. It is based on fractional calculus,
   and its flexibility allows us to model a family of non-Gaussian
   processes, which provides a more generic description of the physical
   world. A generalized fractional Fokker-Planck equation (fFPE) is
   proposed to describe the drift-dffusion processes under long-range
   correlations and memory effects. A new model calibration approach based
   on the maximum accumulative mutual information is also proposed to
   reduce model-form uncertainty, where an optimization procedure is taken.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an innovative computing paradigm that can potentially
   bridge the gap between increasing computing demands in computer aided
   engineering (CAE) applications and limited scalability, flexibility, and
   agility in traditional computing paradigms. In light of the benefits of
   cloud computing, high performance computing (HPC) in the cloud has the
   potential to enable users to not only accelerate computationally
   expensive CAE simulations (e.g., finite element analysis), but also to
   reduce costs by utilizing on-demand and scalable cloud computing
   resources. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance
   of running a large finite element simulation in a public cloud.
   Specifically, an experiment is performed to identify individual. and
   interactive effects of several factors (e.g., CPU core count, memory
   size, solver computational rate, and input/output rate) on run time
   using statistical methods. Our experimental results have shown that the
   performance of HPC in the cloud is sufficient for the application of a
   large finite element analysis, and that run time can be optimized by
   properly selecting a configuration of CPU, memory, and interconnect.}},

Abstract = {{Ecology has acted as a source for sound design principles and studies
   have examined how ecological principles can enhance sustainability in
   human industrial networks. Engineered systems are often designed for
   maximum performance, but in many cases robustness is sought with respect
   to unwanted variations in input or other parameters. Taguchi's signal to
   noise ratio and other quality engineering principles are well known
   fundamentals in the field of robust design. In this paper, we will
   introduce flow-based equations from ecological network analysis (ENA) to
   determine how to modify, the flows and connections in industrial systems
   to balance efficiency and robustness against disturbances. In ENA, the
   robustness of a system is given by the relationship of flow path
   diversity to system efficiency. Systems with diverse flows are more
   resilient to a disturbance since there are redundant pathways, but are
   inefficient precisely because they contain many flow paths with the same
   endpoints. Efficient systems have increased capacity to transfer
   material and energy, but this is at the cost of fewer pathways so the
   system is brittle. Thus, given a disturbance, a robust system balances
   redundancy with efficiency/capacity. Ecological systems seem to occupy a
   narrow range of states that balance efficiency and resilience to confer
   robustness. Human networks, like trade networks, water reclamation
   facilities, etc. have been analyzed using these robustness principles
   and methods for flow based ecological network analysis. These analyses
   show that human networks may be more brittle than their ecological
   counterparts because of insufficient flow path diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The early detection and diagnosis of malignant colorectal tumors enables
   the initiation of early-stage therapy and can significantly increase the
   survival rate and post-treatment quality of life among cancer patients.
   Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is recognized as a powerful tool for
   noninvasive cancer detection. In the gastrointestinal field, most of the
   studies on HSI have involved ex vivo biopsies or resected tissues. In
   the present study, we aimed to assess the difference in the in vivo
   spectral reflectance of malignant colorectal tumors and normal mucosa. A
   total of 21 colorectal tumors or adenomatous polyps from 12 patients at
   Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital were examined using a flexible hyperspectral
   (HS) colonoscopy system that can obtain in vivo HS images of the
   colorectal mucosa. We determined the optimal wavelengths for
   differentiating tumors from normal tissue based on these recorded
   images. The application of the determined wavelengths in spectral
   imaging in clinical trials indicated that such a clinical support system
   comprising a flexible HS colonoscopy unit and band selection unit is
   useful for outlining the tumor region and enhancing the display of the

Abstract = {{This paper extends the use of closed-loop anytime control to systems
   that are inherently unstable in the open-loop. Previous work has shown
   that anytime control is very effective in compensating for occasional
   missed deadlines in the computer processor. When misses occur, the
   control law is truncated or partially executed. However, the previous
   work assumed that the open-loop system was stable. In this paper, the
   anytime strategy is applied to an inverted pendulum system. An LQR
   controller with estimated state feedback is designed and decomposed into
   two stages. Both stages are implemented most of the time, but in a small
   percentage of time, only the first stage is applied, with the resulting
   closed-loop system being unstable for short periods of time. The
   statistical performance of the closed-loop system is studied using
   Monte-Carlo simulations. It is seen that, on average, the closed-loop
   performance is very close to that of the full-order controller as long
   as the miss rate is relatively small. However, the variance of the
   response shows much higher dependence on the miss rate, suggesting that
   the response becomes more unpredictable. At a critical value of miss
   rate, the closed-loop system is unstable. The critical miss rate found
   through simulation is seen to correlate well with the results of a
   deterministic stability analysis. The statistics on the settling time
   are also studied, and shown to grow longer as the miss rate increases.
   The transient behavior of the system is studied for a range of initial
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of a chain of translating carts or housings
   having internally rotating eccentric masses in order to accomplish
   vibration isolation. First a single degree-of-freedom system is
   harmonically excited to uncover the qualitative behavior of each
   rotating mass. The simple model is then expanded into a chain of
   housings, containing rotating eccentric masses, which are interconnected
   with springs. The internal rotating eccentric masses are damped along
   their circular pathway by means of linear viscous damping. Due to the
   lack of elastic or gravitational constraint on the rotating eccentric
   masses, they provide a nonlinear inertial coupling to their housings.
   Previous research has shown that such systems are capable of reducing
   shock or impulsive loading by converting some of the translational
   kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy of the internal masses.
   This paper examines the potential for vibration isolation of a chain of
   such systems subjected to persistent, harmonic excitation. It is seen
   that the dynamics of these systems is very complicated, but that trends
   are observed which have implications for practical isolation systems.
   Using simulation studies, tradeoffs are examined between displacement
   and transmitted force for a range of physical parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are solid-state heat engines consisting
   of p-type and n-type semiconductors that convert heat into electricity
   via the Seebeck effect. Conducting polymers are a viable alternative
   with intrinsic advantages over their inorganic counterparts since they
   are abundant, flexible as thick-films, and have reduced manufacturing
   costs since they can be solution processed. Furthermore, polymers have
   an inherently low thermal conductivity, thus affording them the option
   of forgoing some heat exchanger costs. Current examples of polymer TE
   devices have been limited to traditional flat-plate geometries with
   power densities on the mu W/cm(2) scale, where their potential is not
   fully realized. Herein, we report a novel radial device and evaluate the
   improved performance of polymer-based TEG based on this architecture.
   Analytical heat transfer and electrical models are presented that
   optimize the device for maximum power density, and we obtain the
   geometry matching condition for this radial device that maximizes the
   module figure-of-merit. Our radial architecture accommodates a fluid as
   the heat source and can utilize natural convection alone (due to heat
   spreading) to obtain high power densities of 1-3 mW/cm(2) using
   wstate-of-the-art polymer TEs subjected to a temperature difference of

Abstract = {{Fracture toughness in ductile materials is the combined effect of the
   plastic dissipation and the energy spent in creating new surfaces. The
   design of polycrystalline metals with improved fracture toughness
   requires in-depth understanding of two levels of competitions: the
   competition between plastic deformation and crack formation as well as
   the competition between transgranular and intergranular fracture.
   Currently, no systematic approach exists to address the two
   competitions. The fundamental challenges lie in the difficulty in
   separating the two energy dissipations and inadequate knowledge about
   the correlation between fracture mechanisms and material fracture
   toughness. In this paper, a Cohesive Finite Element Method (CFEM) based
   multiscale framework is introduced to quantify the two levels of
   competitions. The fracture toughness of ductile materials is predicted
   by calculating the J-integral at the macroscale. The fracture surface
   energy for different type of failure mechanisms is evaluated through
   explicit simulation of crack propagation at the microstructure level.
   The calculations carried out here concern AZ31 Mg alloy. Results
   indicate that the mixed transgranular and intergranular failure can lead
   to optimized fracture toughness. Microstructures with refined grain size
   and grain boundary bonding strength can best promote the favorable
   failure mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Critical Assessment of the Long-Term Performance and Cost-Effectiveness
   of a New Pavement Preservation Method Micromilling and Thin Overlay}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2550}},
Pages = {{8-14}},
Abstract = {{The Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) has developed and
   implemented a new pavement preservation method that uses micromilling in
   conjunction with a thin overlay for cost-effective replacement of a
   deteriorated, thin, open-graded surface layer (3/4 to 11/4 in.) without
   removing the sound underlying layer. The new method was first
   implemented in 2007 on a 15.3 mi section on I-75 near Perry, Georgia,
   and resulted in significant savings. In considering whether to adopt the
   new method as standard practice in pavement preservation, it is
   essential to evaluate the method's actual, long-term performance. This
   is the first paper to report the actual, long-term performance of the
   new method. The study used 8 years of pavement condition data collected
   by the Georgia DOT and sensing data collected by Georgia Institute of
   Technology. Based on the data, the pavement on I-75 is still in good
   condition after 8 years (with 6\% raveling in 2015). Based on the
   current condition and the Georgia DOT's past experience with open-graded
   surface mixes, the Georgia DOT anticipates an additional 2 to 3 years of
   service for the I-75 project. This provides a service interval of 10 to
   11 years, which is comparable to that of Georgia's conventional pavement
   rehabilitative strategy for open-graded surfaced Interstate pavements,
   which typically ranges from 10 to 12 years. The equivalent uniform
   annual cost of the new method is \$11,200 per lane-mile per year, which
   is 11\% lower than the \$12,600 per lane-mile for the conventional
   rehabilitation method computed on a 12-year service interval. This
   information can assist transportation agencies in making decisions about
   whether to apply the new pavement preservation treatment.}},

Journal = {{ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL}},

Pages = {{147-158}},
Abstract = {{Many contemporary applications, ranging from flexibly automated
   production systems, to automated material handling and intelligent
   transportation systems, to internet-based workflow management systems,
   and more recently, to the massively parallelized software systems that
   emerge in the context of the novel multi-core computing architectures,
   can be perceived as a set of finite resources that support a number of
   concurrently running processes. These processes execute in a staged
   manner and, at each stage, they vie for the allocation of various
   subsets of the system resources. To effectively support and manage the
   extensive levels of concurrency and operational flexibility that are
   contemplated for these environments, and the ensuing complexity, there
   is a substantial need for formal models and tools that will enable the
   modeling, analysis and eventually the control of the aforementioned
   resource allocation function so that the resulting dynamics are, both,
   behaviorally correct and operationally efficient. This article overviews
   a research program that seeks to address the aforementioned need by
   using the unifying abstraction of the resource allocation system (RAS)
   and supporting modeling frameworks, like automata, Petri nets, and
   Markov reward and decision processes, borrowed from the area of Discrete
   Event Systems (DES) theory. The presented results take advantage of the
   special structure that exists in the considered RAS classes, and they
   are characterized by their analytical rigor and computational
   tractability. The article also highlights the further challenges that
   must be addressed for the successful completion and promotion of the
   pursued framework. (C) 2016 International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {{Traditional engineering design processes focus on the generation of a
   completely defined solution for a specific set of design requirements.
   However, in the modern, rapidly evolving battlespace, Soldiers face the
   need for situationally specific aerial reconnaissance. Recent advances
   in automated manufacturing techniques, such as 3-D printing, have
   enabled the design of small unmanned aerial vehicles in which discrete
   components can be integrated with parametrically scaled and printed
   components. This approach enables mission-driven sizing, design, and
   synthesis of a product family using a small set of components. An
   integrated requirements and design process that separates the Soldier
   from any design engineering is presented. Mission requirements,
   performance models, component attributes, and manufacturing constraints
   are used to suggest a product architecture capable of fulfilling
   requirements. The process is executed to design an on-demand solution to
   specific aerial reconnaissance needs. Assembly takes place in a virtual
   environment prior to physical integration with off-the-shelf components.
   The resulting vehicle is then flown in a controlled environment to mimic
   the mission. A comparison of requirements to actual performance is
   presented. An assessment is made of the proposed capability and
   conclusions are drawn about the applicability and scalability of the
   approach.}},
