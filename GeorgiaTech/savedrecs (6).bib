Abstract = {{Purpose - The functionality of personal mobile electronics continues to
   increase, in turn driving the demand for higher logic-to-memory
   bandwidth. However, the number of inputs/outputs supported by the
   current packaging technology is limited by the smallest achievable
   electrical line spacing, and the associated noise performance. Also, a
   growing trend in mobile systems is for the memory chips to be stacked to
   address the growing demand for memory bandwidth, which in turn gives
   rise to heat removal challenges. The glass interposer substrate is a
   promising packaging technology to address these emerging demands,
   because of its many advantages over the traditional organic substrate
   technology. However, glass has a fundamental limitation, namely low
   thermal conductivity (similar to 1W/mK). The purpose of this paper is to
   quantify the thermal performance of glass interposer-based electronic
   packages by solving a multi-scale heat transfer problem for an
   interposer structure. Also, this paper studies the possible improvement
   in thermal performance by integrating a fluidic heat spreader or vapor
   chamber within the interposer.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper illustrates the multi-scale
   modeling approach applied for different components of the interposer,
   including Through Package Vias (TPVs) and copper traces. For
   geometrically intricate and repeating structures, such as interconnects
   and TPVs, the unit cell effective thermal conductivity approach was
   used. For non-repeating patterns, such as copper traces in
   redistribution layer, CAD drawing-based thermal resistance network
   analysis was used. At the end, the thermal performance of vapor chamber
   integrated within a glass interposer was estimated by using an enhanced
   effective thermal conductivity, calculated from the published thermal
   resistance data, in conjunction with the analytical expression for
   thermal resistance for a given geometry of the vapor chamber.
   Findings - The limitations arising from the low thermal conductivity of
   glass can be addressed by using copper structures and vapor chamber
   technology.
   Originality/value - A few reports can be found on thermal performance of
   glass interposers. However thermal characteristics of glass interposer
   with advanced cooling technology have not been reported.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible polymer-based dielectric materials that are used to store
   dielectric energy have widely been used in modern electronics and
   electric power systems, due to their relatively high energy density,
   light weight, low cost, etc. However, owing to the growing global
   environmental issues and a rapid consumption of nonrenewable polymer
   resources, there exists a strong desire to fabricate flexible dielectric
   materials using biodegradable materials. Here, we report on flexible
   dielectric papers based on biodegradable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for dielectric energy storage. Highly ordered,
   homogeneous CNF/CNT papers have been fabricated using a facile
   vacuum-assisted self-assembly technique. The obtained paper possesses a
   high dielectric constant of 3198 at 1.0 kHz, thus leading to enhanced
   dielectric energy storage capability (0.81 +/- 0.1 J cm(-3)), which is
   attributed to the presence of a low loading of CNTs (4.5 wt\%).
   Moreover, the CNF/CNT papers are mechanically flexible and show improved
   mechanical strength. These findings enable feasible fabrication of
   high-performance flexible dielectric materials using ecofriendly
   materials.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Abstract = {{Conductive elastomers, an irreplaceable component of stretchable
   electronics, have recently gained significant attention. Herein, we
   report highly conductive, sensitive, stretchable, and fully printed
   hybrid composites comprising carbon nanotubes (CNTs), silver
   nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and
   hydroxyl-poly-(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (OH-SBS) polymers.
   The electrically conductive composites are fabricated via direct
   evaporation of CNT-dispersed OH-SBS suspension under mild heating
   conditions, followed via an iterative process of silver precursor
   absorption and reduction, generating large amounts of Ag NPs on both the
   surface and inner regions of the CNT-embedded composites. The obtained
   CNT-Ag NP embedded composites possess a superior electrical conductivity
   of 1228 S cm(-1), a high break elongation of 540\%, and a high gauge
   factor of 26 500. The unique hierarchical multiscale hybrid architecture
   of CNT-Ag NPs and the utilization of OH-SBS enable the as-prepared
   composites to exhibit huge piezoresistive behavior with a broad range of
   tensile strains. Moreover, handwritten electric circuits with diverse
   geometries are designed, and the printed strain gauge sensor could
   successfully detect sign language via its strain-sensing behavior. We
   believe that our hierarchical multiscale hybrid design could pave the
   way for the simple fabrication of stretchable circuits for wearable
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of a rotating conical flow with a solid surface
   generates a centrifugal instability. This occurs in the flow over the
   wings of certain types of aircraft at high angles of attack. Efforts at
   our laboratory have detected such structures using near-surface flow
   diagnostics, and shown that they can be effectively alleviated using
   passive flow control near the surface. Their alleviation removes the
   narrowband spectral peak at the nominal location of vertical fins on
   these aircraft. This paper explores the substitution of active flow
   control techniques that remain conformal to the surface and are only
   powered during high angle of attack operation. The occurrence of the
   phenomenon and its 15-dB alleviation with geometric fences are shown on
   a rounded-edge 42-degree swept, cropped delta wing at 25 degrees angle
   of attack. The feasibility and power requirements for the plasma
   actuator are estimated in this paper. The generation of counter-rotating
   vortices using a double dielectric barrier discharge actuator is
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the flow around a rotating blade in reverse flow is
   described, integrating results from fixed and rotary wing experiments.
   The highly 3-dimensional flow phenomena do not conform to expectations
   based on 2-D airfoil aerodynamics. Fixed-wing results from load
   measurements and flow visualization showed that the sharp-edge vortex
   (SEV) is a primary feature when the blade is yawed either forward or
   backward. The loads are better modeled using the Polhamus leading edge
   suction analogy. Vortex-induced pressure gradient induces an inward
   radial flow overcoming centrifugal effects, but away from the vortex,
   outward radial flow is evident everywhere. A strongly three-dimensional
   and attached SEV is evident under the blade at 240 degrees azimuth. This
   detaches and convects with the flow, remaining close to the blade by 270
   degrees. The vortex seen at 300 degrees is clearly detached, but growth
   of the core diameter corresponding to vortex bursting, causes strong
   suction under the blade. The flow around the blunt edge is again
   strongly 3-D. Some evidence of intermittent separation is seen, but the
   azimuth-resolved, ensemble-averaged flow is mostly attached around the
   blunt edge. Preliminary static pressure contours derived from the
   measured 3-component velocity field are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A cylinder of aspect ratio 1 experiences a rich mixture of phenomena
   when yawed through 360 degrees. Understanding this variation is crucial
   to aerodynamic load definition for objects of practical shape. This
   paper uses several diagnostics to explain the detailed airload map of
   cylinders with length to diameter ratios 0.25 to 4 in steady
   incompressible flow, at Reynolds numbers from 50,000 to 450,000. A sharp
   linear variation of side force coefficient with yaw is bounded by
   apparent stall. Drag and pitching moment depend more on the curved
   surfaces, while side force is dominated by flow over the end plates.
   Tuft visualization and stereo Particle Image Velocimetry complement
   6-DOF loads. Pressure distributions are obtained from velocimetry as
   well as from computations. The flow over the suction side shows a curved
   leading edge vortex followed by reattachment and an aft separation. The
   lift at low yaw is largely due to suction from the zones near the front
   corner, while at higher yaw it comes from the pressure difference
   between the two sides. The presence of helical vortices differentiates
   the lift generation from models based purely on separation.}},

Title = {{Simulation study on evolutionary cycle to cycle time control of exposure
   controlled projection lithography}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{456-464}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Exposure controlled projection lithography (ECPL) is an
   additive manufacturing process based on controlled UV
   photopolymerization. This paper aims to explore an advanced closed-loop
   control methodology to ECPL.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes an evolutionary cycle
   to cycle (EC2C) control method, and started with a reduced order EC2C
   time control to control only the exposure time for given DMD bitmaps,
   which correspond to target 3D part cross-sections. A preliminary EC2C
   time control scheme was developed and followed by two types of EC2C time
   controllers based on two different parameter estimation methods,
   recursive least squares and L-1 norm minimization (L(1)Min). Both
   algorithms were in an exponential weighted form, resulting in EWRLS and
   EWL(1)Min, to weight more on recent data to reflect the current process
   dynamics.
   Findings - EWRLS was found to outperform EWL(1)Min in terms of
   computation speed and stability. The simulation study demonstrated that
   the proposed EC2C time control method was capable of adaptively tracking
   the ECPL process dynamics and updating online the model parameters with
   real-time measurements. It could control perfectly the exposure time for
   each bitmap, achieving the desired height for each layer and resulting
   in a total cured height conforming to the target 3D part height.
   Research limitations/implications - The accuracy of EC2C time control
   method relies heavily on fast and accurate measurement, and this
   research assumes availability of an adequate real-time metrology.
   Measurement errors are not considered in this paper and will be explored
   in future. Only simulation study was performed without physical
   experiments to verify the EC2C controller.
   Practical implications - For implementation, a real-time measurement
   system needs to be developed and the EC2C control software needs to be
   programmed and interfaced with the physical system.
   Originality/value - It concludes that EC2C control method is very
   promising for a physical implementation, and could be extended for the
   development of a more comprehensive closed-loop controller for both
   exposure time and intensity to improve the ECPL process precision and
   robustness.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2@C@MnO2 multi-shelled hollow nanospheres
   with high rate capability and stability for lithium-ion batteries}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{69}},
Pages = {{65243-65251}},
Abstract = {{While TiO2 is regarded as a good anode material for Li ion storage
   because of its excellent cycling stability, high safety and low cost,
   its practical applications for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) still present a
   great challenge due to its poor conductivity and low theoretical
   capacity. A hybrid nanostructured electrode design offers opportunities
   to circumvent these drawbacks. Herein, we report a cost-effective
   strategy for the fabrication of mesoporous TiO2@C@MnO2 multi-shelled
   hollow nanospheres as LIBs anodes. The multiple-shelled structure
   effectively couples the electrochemical functionality of TiO2, MnO2 and
   C including: the excellent stability of TiO2, the large capacity of
   MnO2, and the high electronic conductivity of the carbon layer.
   Meantime, the mesoporous shells and hollow nanostructure design not only
   provide fast Li+ transportation throughout the electrode, but also can
   further buffer the volume expansion of electrodes during
   charge/discharge. As a result, TiO2@C@MnO2 multi-shelled hollow
   nanospheres exhibit an enhanced charge/discharge capacity (506.8 mA h
   g(-1) at the rate of 0.3C after 100 cycles) and excellent rate
   performance (278.7 mA h g(-1) at 3C after 200 cycles), much better than
   the individual parts. Our work on hybrid hollow structures with multiple
   shells demonstrates an efficient way to realize the enhancement of the
   electrochemical performance of LIB anode materials, thus casting light
   on the development of advanced anode materials for next-generation,
   high-performance LIBs.}},

Title = {{Performance evaluation of a continuous-flow bioanode microbial
   electrolysis cell fed with furanic and phenolic compounds}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{70}},
Pages = {{65563-65571}},
Abstract = {{Furanic and phenolic compounds, formed during the pretreatment of
   lignocellulosic biomass, are problematic byproducts in down-stream
   biofuel processes. A microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is an alternative
   technology to handle furanic and phenolic compounds and produce
   renewable hydrogen (H-2). The present study evaluated the performance of
   a continuous-flow bioanode MEC fed with furanic and phenolic compounds
   at different operating conditions. All hydraulic retention times (HRTs)
   tested (6-24 h) resulted in complete transformation of the parent
   compounds at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 0.2 g L-1 per d and
   applied voltage of 0.6 V. Increasing the OLR to 0.8 g L-1 per d at an
   HRT of 6 h resulted in an increased H-2 production rate from 0.07 to
   0.14 L L-anode(-1) per d, but an OLR of 3.2 g L-1 per d did not lead to
   a higher H-2 production rate. Significant methane production was
   observed at an OLR of 3.2 g L-1 per d. The lack of increased H-2
   production at the highest OLR tested was due to a limited rate of
   exoelectrogenesis but not fermentation, evidenced by the accumulation of
   high acetate levels and higher growth of fermenters and methanogens over
   exoelectrogens. Increasing applied voltage from 0.6 to 1.0 V at an OLR
   of 3.2 g L-1 per d and HRT of 6 h enhanced exoelectrogenesis and
   resulted in a 1.7-fold increase of H-2 production. Under all operating
   conditions, more than 90\% of the biomass was biofilm-associated. The
   present study provides new insights into the performance of
   continuous-flow bioelectrochemical systems fed with complex waste
   streams resulting from the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{62}},
Pages = {{S6831-S6838}},
Abstract = {{A series of polymeric dyes based on blocked waterborne polyurethanes
   (BWPUs) with varied molecular weights have been synthesized
   successfully. The influence of molecular weight on the thermal,
   rheological, and printing properties of the BWPUs are mainly
   investigated. The molecular weight of the BWPUs are tailored in the
   range of 2860-24 600 by selecting different chain lengths of
   polyethylene glycol (PEG0/400/600/1000/2000) as soft segments. The glass
   transition temperature (T-g) of the BWPUs decreased from 5.1 degrees C
   to -52.6 degrees C with increasing molecular weight of the soft segment,
   which implied a better film-forming property. Additionally, BWPUs with
   higher molecular weight offered better thermal stability. It is also
   found that BWPUs with a higher molecular weight show a more distinct
   shear thinning behavior and viscous behavior. The synthesized BWPUs were
   further applied in textile printing as both a colorant and adhesive to
   investigate their application performances. The printing viscosity index
   (PVI) values of all BWPUs pastes are below 0.3, suggesting that they are
   preferred for printing fine patterns on hydrophilic fibers. The color
   fastness of the printed cotton fabrics was found to be improved to 4-5
   grade as the molecular weight of the BWPUs and baking temperature were
   increased. Consequently, the polymeric dyes could provide a novel route
   for obtaining high-quality printing products and shortening the textile
   coloring process.}},

Abstract = {{A probabilistic framework for Bayesian inference combined with extreme
   values of Gaussian processes is proposed to assess the maximum of the
   response of an uncertain structure instrumented with sensors and subject
   to a stochastic load. The framework is applied to the analysis of the
   inter-story drift of a multi-story shear-type building under seismic
   hazard using measurements collected by accelerometers. A cascade of two
   dynamic systems is proposed to model the stochastic ground motion and
   the response of the structure. We present an approximate analytical
   solution to estimate the distribution of the maximum response, and
   verify the accuracy and limitations of this solution against simulation
   results. Finally, robustness of the proposed framework to system
   uncertainties, including uncertainties in the structural
   characteristics, ground characteristics, and input motion parameters, is
   investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the shape of metal nanocrystals allows us to not
   only maneuver their physicochemical properties but also optimize their
   activity in a variety of applications. Heterogeneous catalysis, in
   particular, would benefit tremendously from the availability of metal
   nanocrystals with controlled shapes and well-defined facets or surface
   structures. The immediate benefits may include significant enhancements
   in catalytic activity and/or selectivity along with reductions in the
   materials cost. We provide a brief account of recent progress in the
   development of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and thereby
   enhanced catalytic performance for several reactions, including formic
   acid oxidation, oxygen reduction, and hydrogenation. In addition to
   monometallic nanocrystals, we also cover a bimetallic system, in which
   the two metals are formulated as alloyed, core-shell, or core-frame
   structures. Wehope this article will provide further impetus for the
   development of next-generation heterogeneous catalysts essential to a
   broad range of applications.}},

   cells) are promising to bring hope of a permanent cure for diseases and
   disorders that currently cannot be cured by conventional drugs or
   biological molecules. This paradigm shift in modern medicine of using
   cells as novel therapeutics can be realized only if suitable
   manufacturing technologies for large-scale, cost-effective, reproducible
   production of high-quality cells can be developed. Here we review the
   state of the art in therapeutic cell manufacturing, including cell
   purification and isolation, activation and differentiation, genetic
   modification, expansion, packaging, and preservation. We identify
   current challenges and discuss opportunities to overcome them such that
   cell therapies become highly effective, safe, and predictively
   reproducible while at the same time becoming affordable and widely
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Metal additive manufacturing (AM) works on the principle of incremental
   layer-by-layer material consolidation, facilitating the fabrication of
   objects of arbitrary complexity through the controlled melting and
   resolidification of feedstock materials by using high-power energy
   sources. The focus of metal AM is to produce complex-shaped components
   made of metals and alloys to meet demands from various industrial
   sectors such as defense, aerospace, automotive, and biomedicine. Metal
   AM involves a complex interplay between multiple modes of energy and
   mass transfer, fluid flow, phase change, and microstructural evolution.
   Understanding the fundamental physics of these phenomena is a key
   requirement for metal AM process development and optimization. The
   effects of material characteristics and processing conditions on the
   resulting epitaxy and microstructure are of critical interest in metal
   AM. This article reviews various metal AM processes in the context of
   fabricating metal and alloy parts through epitaxial solidification, with
   material systems ranging from pure-metal and prealloyed to
   multicomponent materials. The aim is to cover the relationships between
   various AM processes and the resulting microstructures in these material
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchically porous hollow carbon spheres with an indented void
   structure have been designed as hosts for high-performance cathode
   materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. With a diameter of approximately
   100 nm and a pore volume of 3.72 cm(3) g(-1), the hosts can retain
   sulfur within the porous structures, including the external cone-like
   cavities, the porous carbon shells, and the inner linings. The exquisite
   indented structure provides excellent electron and Li-ion pathways while
   the symmetrically indented voids evenly alleviate the stress induced by
   the volume change during cycling. The oxygen functional groups further
   relieve the shuttle effect of polysulfide. A composite electrode with
   52\% sulfur loading demonstrates a remarkable initial discharge capacity
   of 1478 mA h g(-1) at 1/10C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)), corresponding to 88\%
   sulfur utilization. Even when the sulfur/carbon (S/C) ratio of the
   composite is increased threefold from 1 : 1 to 3 : 1 (75\% sulfur
   loading), a very high capacity retention is still maintained, achieving
   an ultraslow rate of capacity fading, similar to 0.047\% per cycle over
   1200 cycles at 1/2C.}},

Title = {{Facile synthesis of hierarchical MoS2-carbon microspheres as a robust

Pages = {{9653-9660}},
Abstract = {{Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) may be a promising alternative for lithium
   ion batteries (LIBs) because it offers a unique layered crystal
   structure with a large and tunable distance between layers. This enables
   the anticipated excellent rate and cycling stability because they can
   promote the reversible lithium ion intercalation and de-intercalation
   without huge volume change which consequently prevents the pulverization
   of active materials during repeated charge and discharge processes.
   Herein, we prepared hierarchical MoS2-carbon (MoS2-C) microspheres via a
   continuous and scalable ultrasonic nebulization assisted route. The
   structure, composition, and electrochemical properties are investigated
   in detail. The MoS2-C microspheres consist of few-layer MoS2 nanosheets
   bridged by carbon, which separates the exfoliated MoS2 layers and
   prevents their aggregation and restacking, thus leading to improved
   kinetic, enhanced conductivity and structural integrity. The novel
   architecture offers additional merits such as overall large size and
   high packing density, which promotes their practical applications. The
   MoS2-C microspheres have been demonstrated with excellent
   electrochemical performances in terms of low resistance, high capacity
   even at large current density, stable cycling performance, etc. The
   electrodes exhibited 800 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1) over 170 cycles. At
   a higher current density of 3200 mA g(-1), a capacity of 730 mA h g(-1)
   can be also maintained. The MoS2-C microspheres are practically
   applicable not only because of the continuous and large scale synthesis
   via the current strategy, but also the possess a robust and integrated
   architecture which ensures the excellent electrochemical properties.}},

Abstract = {{A chance constrained problem involves a set of scenario constraints from
   which a small subset can be violated. Existing works typically consider
   a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation of this problem by
   introducing binary variables to indicate which constraint systems are to
   be satisfied or violated. A variety of cutting plane approaches for this
   MIP formulation have been developed. In this paper we consider a family
   of cuts for chance constrained problems in the original space rather
   than those in the extended space of the MIP reformulation. These cuts,
   known as quantile cuts, can be viewed as a projection of the well known
   family of mixing inequalities for the MIP reformulation, onto the
   original problem space. We show the following results regarding quantile
   cuts: (i) the closure of all quantile cuts is a polyhedral set; (ii)
   separation of quantile cuts is in general NP-hard; (iii) successive
   application of quantile cut closures achieves the convex hull of the
   chance constrained problem in the limit; and (iv) in the pure integer
   setting this convergence is finite.}},

Title = {{Porous PbI2 films for the fabrication of efficient, stable perovskite
   solar cells via sequential deposition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{10223-10230}},
Abstract = {{Two-step sequential deposition has been widely used for the fabrication
   of organolead halide perovskites due to its efficient pore-filling in
   mesostructured perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and great controllability
   of the perovskite film morphology. However, due to the limited
   diffusivity of the organic salt, it is often difficult to fully convert
   a >150 nm compact PbI2 precursor film to perovskite during a sequential
   deposition process. Consequently, the uncontrollable amount of remnant
   PbI2 may not only affect the device reproducibility but also harm the
   air stability of the perovskite films. In this work, we developed a new
   method to synthesize PbI2 thin films with nano-pores and tunable crystal
   sizes. We found that the porous structure and small crystal size of the
   synthesized PbI2 can facilitate its conversion to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite,
   resulting in a PbI2-free and highly oriented perovskite film. PSCs based
   on such perovskite films exhibit superior power conversion efficiencies
   as compared to the ones synthesized from compact PbI2 films; more
   importantly, the stability of the perovskite films and PSCs has been
   greatly improved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate extraction of cardiac fiber orientation from diffusion tensor
   imaging is important for determining heart structure and function.
   However, the acquisition of magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor
   images is costly and time consuming. By comparison, cardiac ultrasound
   imaging is rapid and relatively inexpensive, but it lacks the capability
   to directly measure fiber orientations. In order to create a detailed
   heart model from ultrasound data, a three-dimensional (3D) diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) with known fiber orientations can be registered to
   an ultrasound volume through a geometric mask. After registration, the
   cardiac orientations from the template DTI can be mapped to the heart
   using a deformable transformation field. This process depends heavily on
   accurate fiber orientation extraction from the DTI. In this study, we
   use the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to determine cardiac fiber
   orientations in diffusion weighted images. For the registration between
   ultrasound and MRI volumes, we achieved an average Dice similarity
   coefficient (DSC) of 81.6 +/- 2.1\%. For the estimation of fiber
   orientations from the proposed method, we achieved an acute angle error
   (AAE) of 22.7 +/- 3.1 as compared to the direct measurements from DTI.
   This work provides a new approach to generate cardiac fiber orientation
   that may be used for many cardiac applications.}},

Abstract = {{Addition of soy flour to a batch repulper in a recycle linerboard mill
   led to a 6\% increase in ring crush at a cost of about \$2/tonne. In
   laboratory work, soy lecithin provided similar increases in burst and
   other parameters for both virgin and recycle pulps. The underlying
   mechanisms through which soy flour and lecithin act are different.
   Protein solubilized from soy flour in the repulper promotes fiber
   bonding through charge effects. Lecithin coats fiber surfaces and
   reduces surface roughness as shown by nanoscale imaging. It is proposed
   that inter-fiber friction is reduced as a consequence, which improves
   formation.}},

Title = {{Simulating secondary organic aerosol from missing diesel-related

Abstract = {{We present high-resolution (5aEuro-kmaEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x
   aEuro-5aEuro-km) atmospheric chemical transport model (ACTM) simulations
   of the impact of newly estimated traffic-related emissions on secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA) formation over the UK for 2012. Our simulations
   include additional diesel-related intermediate-volatility organic
   compound (IVOC) emissions derived directly from comprehensive field
   measurements at an urban background site in London during the 2012 Clean
   Air for London (ClearfLo) campaign. Our IVOC emissions are added
   proportionally to VOC emissions, as opposed to proportionally to primary
   organic aerosol (POA) as has been done by previous ACTM studies seeking
   to simulate the effects of these missing emissions. Modelled
   concentrations are evaluated against hourly and daily measurements of
   organic aerosol (OA) components derived from aerosol mass spectrometer
   (AMS) measurements also made during the ClearfLo campaign at three sites
   in the London area. According to the model simulations, diesel-related
   IVOCs can explain on average aEuro parts per thousand aEuro-30aEuro-\%
   of the annual SOA in and around London. Furthermore, the 90th percentile
   of modelled daily SOA concentrations for the whole year is 3.8aEuro-A mu
   gaEuro-m(-3), constituting a notable addition to total particulate
   matter. More measurements of these precursors (currently not included in
   official emissions inventories) is recommended. During the period of
   concurrent measurements, SOA concentrations at the Detling rural
   background location east of London were greater than at the central
   London location. The model shows that this was caused by an intense
   pollution plume with a strong gradient of imported SOA passing over the
   rural location. This demonstrates the value of modelling for supporting
   the interpretation of measurements taken at different sites or for short
   durations.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a framework to efficiently parameterise the aerosol water
   uptake for mixtures of semi-volatile and non-volatile compounds, based
   on the coefficient, nu(i). This solute-specific coefficient was
   introduced in Metzger et al. (2012) to accurately parameterise the
   single solution hygroscopic growth, considering the Kelvin effect -
   accounting for the water uptake of concentrated nanometer-sized
   particles up to dilute solutions, i.e. from the compounds relative
   humidity of deliquescence (RHD) up to supersaturation (Kohler theory).
   Here we extend the nu(i) parameterisation from single to mixed
   solutions. We evaluate our framework at various levels of complexity, by
   considering the full gas-liquid-solid partitioning for a comprehensive
   comparison with reference calculations using the E-AIM, EQUISOLV II and
   ISORROPIA II models as well as textbook examples. We apply our
   parameterisation in the EQuilibrium Simplified Aerosol Model V4
   (EQSAM4clim) for climate simulations, implemented in a box model and in
   the global chemistry-climate model EMAC. Our results show (i) that the
   nu(i) approach enables one to analytically solve the entire
   gas-liquid-solid partitioning and the mixed solution water uptake with
   sufficient accuracy, (ii) that ammonium sulfate mixtures can be solved
   with a simple method, e.g. pure ammonium nitrate and mixed ammonium
   nitrate and (iii) that the aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations are
   in close agreement with remote sensing observations for the year 2005.
   Long-term evaluation of the EMAC results based on EQSAM4clim and
   ISORROPIA II will be presented separately.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the concentration, cloud condensation nuclei
   (CCN) activity and hygroscopic properties of particles influenced by
   biomass burning in the eastern Mediterranean and their impacts on cloud
   droplet formation. Air masses sampled were subject to a range of
   atmospheric processing (several hours up to 3 days). Values of the
   hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, were derived from CCN measurements and
   a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA). An Aerosol
   Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) was also used to determine the
   chemical composition and mass concentration of non-refractory components
   of the submicron aerosol fraction. During fire events, the increased
   organic content (and lower inorganic fraction) of the aerosol decreases
   the values of kappa, for all particle sizes. Particle sizes smaller than
   80aEuro-nm exhibited considerable chemical dispersion (where
   hygroscopicity varied up to 100aEuro-\% for particles of same size);
   larger particles, however, exhibited considerably less dispersion owing
   to the effects of condensational growth and cloud processing. ACSM
   measurements indicate that the bulk composition reflects the
   hygroscopicity and chemical nature of the largest particles (having a
   diameter of aEuro-100aEuro-nm at dry conditions) sampled. Based on
   positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the organic ACSM
   spectra, CCN concentrations follow a similar trend as the
   biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA) component, with the former being
   enhanced between 65 and 150aEuro-\% (for supersaturations ranging
   between 0.2 and 0.7aEuro-\%) with the arrival of the smoke plumes. Using
   multilinear regression of the PMF factors (BBOA, OOA-BB and OOA) and the
   observed hygroscopicity parameter, the inferred hygroscopicity of the
   oxygenated organic aerosol components is determined. We find that the
   transformation of freshly emitted biomass burning (BBOA) to more
   oxidized organic aerosol (OOA-BB) can result in a 2-fold increase of the
   inferred organic hygroscopicity; about 10aEuro-\% of the total aerosol
   hygroscopicity is related to the two biomass-burning components (BBOA
   and OOA-BB), which in turn contribute almost 35aEuro-\% to the
   fine-particle organic water of the aerosol. Observation-derived
   calculations of the cloud droplet concentrations that develop for
   typical boundary layer cloud conditions suggest that biomass burning
   increases droplet number, on average by 8.5aEuro-\%. The strongly
   sublinear response of clouds to biomass-burning (BB) influences is a
   result of strong competition of CCN for water vapor, which results in
   very low maximum supersaturation (0.08aEuro-\% on average). Attributing
   droplet number variations to the total aerosol number and the chemical
   composition variations shows that the importance of chemical composition
   increases with distance, contributing up to 25aEuro-\% of the total
   droplet variability. Therefore, although BB may strongly elevate CCN
   numbers, the impact on droplet number is limited by water vapor
   availability and depends on the aerosol particle concentration levels
   associated with the background.}},

Abstract = {{Human development and disease are challenging to study because of lack
   of experimental accessibility to in vivo systems and the complex nature
   of biological processes. For these reasons researchers turn to the use
   of model systems, ranging in complexity and scale from single cells to
   model organisms. While the use of model organisms is valuable for
   studying physiology and pathophysiology in an in vivo context and for
   aiding pre-clinical development of therapeutics, animal models are
   costly, difficult to interrogate, and not always equivalent to human
   biology. For these reasons, three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have
   emerged as an attractive model system that contains key aspects of in
   vivo tissue and organ complexity while being more experimentally
   tractable than model organisms. In particular, organ-on-a-chip and
   organoid models represent orthogonal approaches that have been able to
   recapitulate characteristics of physiology and disease. Here, we review
   advances in these two categories of 3D cultures and applications in
   studying development and disease. Additionally, we discuss development
   of key technologies that facilitate the generation of 3D cultures,
   including microfluidics, biomaterials, genome editing, and imaging
   technologies.}},

Title = {{Index of network resilience for urban water distribution systems}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{120-142}},
Abstract = {{A unique demographic shift towards urban centres has necessitated
   incorporation of sustainability principles in the tenets of urban
   infrastructure planning and design. Adopting resilience as the indicator
   of sustainability, this paper presents a novel index of network
   resilience (INR) for urban water distribution systems. The index
   developed in this paper incorporates six network attributes to develop a
   composite INR based on the topology of the water distribution systems. A
   multi-criteria analysis (MCA) using the weighted summation approach is
   employed to evaluate the alternative configurations which would satisfy
   the demand and other hydraulic requirements. Analytic hierarchy process
   (AHP) was assigned to assign weights to the attributes and was optimised
   for two scenarios: resilience and efficiency. Using the original
   configuration of Anytown network as the base case scenario, four
   alternative designs were developed. The results indicate that resilience
   of the system, in terms of increased robustness and redundancy, can be
   increased through a better topology without increasing material and
   energy investment. In addition, the results also indicate that there
   might be some potential trade-off between resilience and efficiency of
   flow for the network.}},

Abstract = {{Printable elastic conductive composites with high conductivity and
   flexibility have exciting applications in burgeoning flexible
   electronics. However, the low-cost fabrication of flexible conductors is
   still a great challenge, especially they can be directly printed on
   various substrates even including the wearable woven textiles, and give
   perfect printed patterns. Herein, we report a facile and low-cost
   strategy to fabricate directly printable elastic conductive composites
   with a conductivity of 4.12 x 10(4) S m(-1) at a low silver loading of
   42.88 wt\%. The elastic conductor is simply comprised of core-shell
   polystyrene/silver (PS@Ag) hybrid conductive particles with an average
   size of 5.86 mm and a viscous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. The
   viscous mixture pastes can be easily fabricated into conductive films or
   directly printed on various substrates to obtain elastic conductive
   circuits with arbitrary geometries and high resolution by the screen
   printing method. The fabricated elastic PS@Ag/PDMS conductor exhibits
   high electrical conductivity and good electrical stability under
   vigorous cycles of mechanical deformations, such as bending, crimping
   and stretching. These merits make it a competitive candidate for
   flexible circuits and wearable electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In energy-resolved CT, images are reconstructed independently at
   different energy levels, resulting in images with different qualities
   but the same structures. We propose a similarity-based non-local
   filtration method to extract structural information from these images
   for noise suppression. For each pixel, we calculate its similarity to
   other pixels based on CT number. The calculation is repeated on each
   image at different energy levels and similarity values are averaged to
   generate a similarity matrix. Noise suppression is achieved by
   multiplying the image vector by the similarity matrix. Multiple scans on
   a tabletop CT system are used to simulate 6-channel energy-resolved CT,
   with energies ranging from 75 to 125 kVp. Phantom studies show that the
   proposed method improves average contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of seven
   materials on the 75 kVp image by a factor of 22. Compared with averaging
   CT images for noise suppression, our method achieves a higher CNR and
   reduces the CT number error of iodine solutions from 16.5\% to 3.5\% and
   the overall image root of mean-square error (RMSE) from 3.58\% to
   0.93\%. On the phantom with line-pair structures, our algorithm reduces
   noise standard deviation (STD) by a factor of 23 while maintaining 7
   1p/cm spatial resolution. Additionally, anthropomorphic head phantom
   studies show noise STD reduction by a factor or 26 with no loss of
   spatial resolution. The noise suppression achieved by the
   similarity-based method is clinically attractive, especially for CNRs of
   iodine in contrast-enhanced CT.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:
   Scatter errors are detrimental to cone-beam breast CT (CBBCT) accuracy
   and obscure the visibility of calcifications and soft-tissue lesions. In
   this work, we propose practical yet effective scatter correction for
   CBBCT using a library-based method and investigate its feasibility via
   small-group patient studies.
   Method:
   Based on a simplified breast model with varying breast sizes, we
   generate a scatter library using Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. Breasts
   are approximated as semi-ellipsoids with homogeneous glandular/adipose
   tissue mixture. On each patient CBBCT projection dataset, an initial
   estimate of scatter distribution is selected from the pre-computed
   scatter library by measuring the corresponding breast size on raw
   projections and the glandular fraction on a first-pass CBBCT
   reconstruction. Then the selected scatter distribution is modified by
   estimating the spatial translation of the breast between MC simulation
   and the clinical scan. Scatter correction is finally performed by
   subtracting the estimated scatter from raw projections.
   Results:
   On two sets of clinical patient CBBCT data with different breast sizes,
   the proposed method effectively reduces cupping artifact and improves
   the image contrast by an average factor of 2, with an efficient
   processing time of 200ms per cone beam projection.
   Conclusion:
   Compared with existing scatter correction approaches on CBBCT, the
   proposed library-based method is clinically advantageous in that it
   requires no additional scans or hardware modifications. As the MC
   simulations are pre-computed, our method achieves a high computational
   efficiency on each patient dataset The library-based method has shown
   great promise as a practical tool for effective scatter correction on
   clinical CBBCT.}},

Abstract = {{Crumpled graphene is known to have a strong aggregation-resistive
   property due to its unique 3D morphology, providing a promising solution
   to prevent the restacking issue of graphene based electrode materials.
   Here, we demonstrate the utilization of redox-active oxygen functional
   groups on the partially reduced crumpled graphene oxide (r-CGO) for
   electrochemical energy storage applications. To effectively utilize the
   surface redox reactions of the functional groups, hierarchical networks
   of electrodes including r-CGO and functionalized few-walled carbon
   nanotubes (f-FWNTs) are assembled via a vacuum-filtration process,
   resulting in a 3D porous structure. These composite electrodes are
   employed as positive electrodes in Li-cells, delivering high gravimetric
   capacities of up to similar to 170 mA h g(-1) with significantly
   enhanced rate-capability compared to the electrodes consisting of
   conventional 2D reduced graphene oxide and f-FWNTs. These results
   highlight the importance of microstructure design coupled with oxygen
   chemistry control, to maximize the surface redox reactions on
   functionalized graphene based electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the thermal boundary resistance and thermal
   conductivity of GaN layers grown on Si with 100 nm AlN transition layers
   using time domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). The GaN layers ranged from

   boundary resistance of the buried interfaces found in this architecture,
   a new data reduction scheme for TDTR that utilizes a Monte Carlo fitting
   method is introduced and found to dramatically reduce the uncertainty in
   certain model parameters. The results show that the GaN thermal
   conductivity does not change significantly with layer thickness, whereas
   the resistance of the AlN layer decreases slightly with GaN thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Various markets exhibit growth and collapse in prices that are sometimes
   called bubbles, and cycles if the phenomenon repeats. Rational
   expectations models have been proposed to explain these phenomena;
   however, such models suffer from a number of criticisms, including lack
   of experimental support. Moreover, they assume unbiased forecasts
   without explaining how the investors form their forecasts. In this
   paper, we provide a model of asset price forecasts and market prices
   that can be calibrated with experimental data and that can capture
   various behavioural characteristics of investors such as confidence and
   panic. We study the resulting dynamical system and show that asset price
   bubbles may result from seemingly reasonable forecasts and decisions of
   investors. The model attempts to provide insight into the qualitative
   connection between investors' forecasting behaviour and the formation of
   bubbles and cycles. We present results on the convergence of the process
   to a fixed point, or to an attractor that describes a price cycle, or to
   long-run behaviour that seems unpredictable, and we consider where in
   the cycles most time is spent.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2593}},
Pages = {{74-84}},
Abstract = {{There are ongoing efforts to leverage the large volume of data collected
   to support real-time traffic operations for various non-real-time uses.
   However, adapting data streams to a different purpose can be
   challenging, especially if different applications use the data in
   different ways. Although traffic operations and traffic monitoring
   programs often use similar technology for vehicle detection, they may
   have different sensitivities to potential errors. Although small errors
   in traffic counts may not be critical in traffic operations, for which
   data are refreshed every few seconds, the same error levels could become
   much more significant in traffic monitoring, for which data, and the
   corresponding errors, are typically aggregated over longer periods of
   time. This study investigates if and how traffic volume data from
   detectors at signalized intersections could be appropriately used in a
   traffic monitoring program that supports the Highway Performance
   Monitoring System (HPMS). For this purpose, this study evaluates both
   the accuracy and representativeness of these traffic signal detector
   data in comparison to standard HPMS-type traffic count data obtained by
   portable pneumatic counters under different traffic flow conditions and
   intersection geometries. The results, although varying by site, indicate
   that these traffic signal detectors can produce 15 -min aggregate
   traffic counts of comparable quality to results from portable pneumatic
   tube counters and provide 90\% accuracy at a 95\% level of confidence
   for 15 -min aggregate counts. Through an examination of the
   representativeness of the data under different conditions, the study
   develops a set of eligibility criteria that can be used to identify
   intersections that are suitable for performance monitoring data
   collection.}},

Abstract = {{The modeling of maraging steel phase transformation in grinding process
   is presented in this article. Specifically, heating rate and contact
   zone temperature are examined to quantitatively link material
   properties, wheel topography characteristics and process parameters to
   the kinetics of diffusion-controlled transformation and diffusionless
   transformation. Physics-based modeling and prediction for the volume
   fractions of phase transformation in continuous heating under
   anisothermal conditions are developed based upon the addition of volume
   fractions in sequential segmented isothermal processes of grinding. The
   predictive model is validated by 18Ni (250) maraging steel grinding
   experiments, X-ray diffraction measurements and regression analyses.
   Results are compared to the model predicted of martensite and ferrite
   phase volume fractions after grinding. The physics-based model is
   experimentally validated as viable to predict the occurrence and extent
   of phase transformation related to material properties, wheel topography
   and grinding thermal-mechanical loading. Finally, correlation analysis

Abstract = {{Pneumatic actuators are frequently selected for use in machines intended
   for human interaction because of their clean operation and natural
   compliance. However, the compliance, coupled with friction, can also
   make motion control difficult, leading to the use of more aggressive
   controllers, such as high-gain PID or sliding mode control, which result
   in stiff closed-loop system behavior. Model-based options are needed to
   obtain behavior that provides a better trade-off of compliance and
   accurate position control. In particular, Model Predictive Control (MPC)
   is suggested; through the use of constrained optimal control, it offers
   a framework for minimizing tracking error while enforcing force
   constraints that ensure low impedance behavior.
   This paper assesses the suitability of controllers for pneumatic systems
   to positioning applications in which human machine interaction is
   anticipated. MPC is compared against commonly-used alternatives for such
   scenarios: sliding mode, PID, and impedance control. Results are shown
   in simulation, and use spectral analysis of the impedance and closed
   loop tracking to characterize the balance of compliance and accuracy for
   each of the controllers.}},

   feet, and perhaps hundreds of feet above the payload, it is very
   difficult for crane operators to know if the hoist cable is perfectly
   vertical before they start to lift the payload off the ground.
   Inevitably, some horizontal motion of the payload will occur at lift
   off. If an off-center lift creates substantial horizontal motion, then
   it can create significant hazards for the human operators, the crane,
   the payload, and the surrounding environment. This paper develops a
   three-dimensional dynamic model of off-centered lifts. The accuracy of
   the model is experimentally investigated using a 10-ton bridge crane.}},

Abstract = {{Certain heavy-lifting applications require the coordinated movement of
   multiple cranes. Such tasks dramatically increase the complexity of
   crane operation, especially when the payload has a non-uniform shape.
   Therefore, controlling such a complex dynamic system requires skilled
   operators. However, even with extensive operator training, manipulating
   a crane with a large payload is difficult and presents serious safety
   hazards. This paper studies the dynamic behavior of a dual-hoist bridge
   crane moving triangular payloads. Test subjects used a wireless
   controller to move a dual-hoist crane with a triangular payload. They
   drove the payload through an obstacle course under various operating
   conditions. The time required to complete the course and the operator
   effort were recorded. Test runs were completed with and without
   input-shaping oscillation control. The result shows that using
   input-shaping oscillation control significantly reduces not only the
   task completion time but also the number of button pushes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the suitability of pneumatically driven,
   MRI-compatible vane actuators for stroke rehabilitation, particularly
   functional recovery of hemiparetic limbs. Hemiparesis patients suffer a
   sudden loss of motor skills in the upper-limb due to brain injury, such
   as stroke. As an emerging physio-therapy technique for hemiparesis,
   named repetitive facilitation exercise, or RFE, a therapist manually
   applies brief mechanical stimuli to the peripheral target muscles (e.g.,
   tapping, stretching of tendon/muscle) followed by wrist
   pronation/supination immediately before a patient intends to produce a
   movement with the muscle. In an earlier study, a robotic system that
   replicates the mechanical tendon stimulation part of RFE procedure in
   MRI with the required timing precision has been developed and tested by
   the authors to investigate the underlying principles of functional
   recovery via RFE. This work presents the design of a vane actuator that
   fits into the tight space in MR-scanners, and analyzes its dynamic
   performance via a detailed pneumatic system model. The analysis
   indicates that a pneumatically driven, tele-operated vane actuator can
   satisfy the dynamic requirements of the targeted rehabilitation

Abstract = {{Complex thin -wall component machining has been a challenging task in
   advanced manufacturing because distributed deformation and vibration of
   workpiece render poor precision in final.products, which requires
   displacement field measurements for vibration compensation techniques to
   enhance product quality. It is desired to capture the distributed and
   dynamic characteristics of workpiece during the machining of thin -wall
   plates. In the context of an engineering application where an annular
   compressor disk is lathe-turned on a duplex machine, this paper has
   developed an analytical method to capture the effects of stepped
   thickness on the thin -wall plate dynamics, where the stepped shape
   emulates the geometry of a workpiece under machining. Modal natural
   frequencies characterizing varying inertia and stiffness are obtained
   via a formulated boundary value problem, upon which the effects of
   cutting tool positions on the frequencies and mode shapes are analyzed.
   It also provides numerical verification with finite element analysis and
   validation with experiment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel user interface (UI) for coordinated rate
   control (CRC) of an excavator end effector using traditional hardware.
   Coordinated control of an excavator end effector alleviates the
   cognitive load created by nonlinear arm dynamics on the excavator
   operator, allowing the operator to perform tasks more quickly and with
   fewer errors. A human subject experiment demonstrates the feasibility of
   excavator CRC using the traditional twin joystick setup, and compares
   operator performance between a CRC UI and traditional excavator UI.
   Performance of the CRC UI was statically equivalent to the performance
   of the traditional UI. When asked to self-report UI preference: 26
   participants stated they preferred the CRC UI, 6 preferred the
   traditional UI, and 14 had no preference. Although the current iteration
   of the CRC UI offered no measurable performance improvements, a
   remapping of the CRC joystick inputs to the end effector motion could
   make the CRC UI more intuitive, lead to better performance metrics, and
   make hydraulic excavators safer, more efficient, and easier to use.}},

Abstract = {{An unsteady one-dimensional dynamic model has been developed at Georgia
   Tech to investigate the impact of stage characteristics as well as load
   distribution on the compression and expansion waves that develop prior
   to a surge event in a multistage axial compressor. In the developed
   model, each of the blade rows is replaced by a duct of varying
   cross-sectional area with force and work source terms. The source terms
   model the force and energy imparted by a blade row to the working fluid.
   The modeling assumes the flow to be inviscid, unsteady, compressible and
   axisymmetric. While rotating stall cannot be explicitly modeled in a 1D
   mean-line method, the effect of rotating stall can be captured by a
   judicious choice of source terms that reflects the loss of pumping
   capability of a stage. Conservation of mass, momentum and energy are
   applied to an elemental control volume resulting in one-dimensional
   quasi-linear Euler system of equations. A non-uniform grid and the
   second-order central difference Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) scheme are used to
   discretize the one-dimensional computational domain. The resulting ODEs
   are solved with an explicit second order Runge-Kutta solver. A throttle
   schedule is used to introduce perturbations at a selected operating
   condition in order to study flow oscillations that can lead to a stall
   event. The current study is aimed at validation of the developed flow
   solver using an industrial compressor database. Further, the current
   study is aimed at understanding the interaction between the stages with
   regards to pressure oscillations leading to stall.}},

Abstract = {{Rate-of-momentum measurements of transient fuel sprays are valuable for
   improving current combustion and emission strategies. This data provides
   boundary conditions for engine computational fluid dynamic (CFD)
   simulations and provides insight into the transient mixing
   characteristics of the spray prior to and during combustion. Previous
   researchers have quantified the rate-of-momentum of transient sprays
   using the impingement technique, but uncertainties remain in relating
   the impingement force to the injected fuel momentum at the nozzle exit.
   Rate-of-momentum measurements are typically performed by directing a
   spray onto the face of a calibrated transducer in close proximity to the
   nozzle. The measured impingement force is then used to quantify the
   rate-of momentum at the nozzle orifice exit with the aid of a simplified
   control volume analysis. However, under elevated back pressures,
   additional terms in the control volume analysis are no longer
   negligible. Other non-idealities, such as non orthogonal droplet
   impingement outcomes and transient mass accumulation in the control
   volume, can also contribute to errors in the simplified analysis.
   This paper investigates the impact of non-idealities in
   impingement-based rate-of-momentum measurements on the quantified fuel
   injection rate. In specific, we compare the measured rate-of-momentum
   under back pressure and atmospheric pressure using two different
   transducers to quantify uncertainties that can arise-under back pressure
   conditions. Uncertainties associated with transient mass accumulation
   and non-orthogonal spray deflection are also investigated. We found that
   back pressure affected both the start and end of injection when compared
   to atmospheric pressure. Under back pressure, there was a lengthened
   apparent start-of-injection transient, which likely results from a low
   pressure toroidal vortex occurring at the head of the spray. In
   addition, there was a longer apparent closing transient, which is likely
   a result of residual pressure distribution after the end-of injection.
   No evidence of transient mass accumulation was observed for the
   injectors used in this study. Lastly, the transient spray was observed
   to deflect non-orthogonally from the impact point on the transducer
   instead of remaining parallel to the transducer face after initial
   impact. This deflection of the spray leads to uncertainties when
   quantifying the rate-of momentum, where the apparent rate-of-momentum
   could be larger than the actual value.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocaloric materials have emerged as a viable technology for solid
   state heating/cooling and waste heat recovery applications. We determine
   here intrinsic electrocaloric (EC) entropy and temperature changes in
   perovskite ferroelectrics (FEs) using theoretical tools supported by
   experimentally measured heat capacities as a function of the applied
   electric field and temperature. A quantitative theoretical analysis of
   the thermal, pyroelectric and EC properties of representative ceramic FE
   systems is provided for BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 (PT) that display a weak and a
   strong first-order phase transformation to the FE state, and relaxor-FE
   xPb(Mgl/Nb-3(2/3))O-3-(1 - x)PbTiO3 {[}xPMN - (1 - x)PT] solid
   solutions. Our results indicate that the intrinsic adiabatic temperature
   changes in relaxor-FEs are substantial. Temperature variations (related
   to reduced entropy) as high as 14 degrees C can be achieved with applied
   fields on the order of 1 MV cm(-1) at T similar to 350 degrees C for
   (001) oriented 0.65PMN-0.35PT. Moreover, the EC response does not vary
   over a large temperature interval: 13 +/- 1 degrees C for 200 < T < 600
   degrees C. In PT, the adiabatic temperature change is approximately 28

Abstract = {{Objects of arbitrary shapes have to be carried as slung loads under
   aircraft, particularly rotorcraft. The flight speed is limited by the
   possibility of slung loads going into divergent oscillations. In 2014 we
   presented a testing-based approach to predict the safe flight speed,
   applicable to bluff bodies of arbitrary shape. Since then, an extensive
   variety of bluff-body shapes has been tested, and we venture further
   towards generalized airload prediction, required for generalized
   divergence speed prediction. Extending recent work, the Continuous
   Rotation method is applied to obtain aerodynamic loads on generic
   shapes: a circular cylinder and a rectangular prism, both with aspect
   ratio varied systematically. The genesis of the side force on the yawed
   cylinder, and the differences between rough and smooth cylinders, have
   been derived from comparisons between experiments and diagnostic
   computations with an unsteady Navier-Stokes solver. Interpolating
   Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal load variation appears to be
   viable to generalize loads on cylinders of varying aspect ratio for both
   the generic shapes.}},

   L-amino acid deaminase}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{L-Amino acid deaminases (LAADs; EC 1.4.3.2) belong to a family of amino
   acid dehydrogenases that catalyze the formation of alpha-keto acids from
   L-amino acids. In a previous study, a whole cell biocatalyst with the
   L-amino acid deaminase (pm1) from Proteus mirabilis was developed for
   the one-step production of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) from
   L-glutamic acid, and the alpha-KG titer reached 12.79 g L-1 in a 3 L
   batch bioreactor. However, the product alpha-KG strongly inhibited pm1
   activity, and the titer of alpha-KG was comparatively lower than
   expected. Therefore, in this study, multiple rounds of error-prone
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene shuffling were integrated for
   the molecular engineering of pm1 to further improve the catalytic
   performance and alpha-KG titer. A variant (pm1338g4), which contained
   mutations in 34 amino acid residues, was found to have enhanced
   catalytic efficiency. In a batch system, the alpha-KG titer reached
   53.74 g L-1 when 100 g of monosodium glutamate was used as a substrate.
   Additionally, in a fed-batch biotransformation system, the maximum
   alpha-KG titer reached 89.11 g L-1 when monosodium glutamate was
   continuously fed at a constant rate of 6 g L-1 h(-1) (from 4 to 23 h)
   with an initial concentration of 50 g L-1. Analysis of the kinetics of
   the mutant variant showed that these improvements were achieved due to
   enhancement of the reaction velocity (from 56.7 mu M min(-1) to 241.8 mu
   M min(-1)) and substrate affinity (the K-m for glutamate decreased from
   23.58 to 6.56 mM). A possible mechanism for the enhanced substrate
   affinity was also evaluated by structural modeling of the mutant. Our
   findings showed that the integration of error-prone PCR and gene
   shuffling was an effective method for improvement of the catalytic
   performance of industrial enzymes.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impact of anthropogenic pollution on isoprene-derived
   secondary organic aerosol formation in PM2.5 collected from the
   Birmingham, Alabama, ground site during the 2013 Southern Oxidant and
   Aerosol Study}},

Abstract = {{In the southeastern US, substantial emissions of isoprene from deciduous
   trees undergo atmospheric oxidation to form secondary organic aerosol
   (SOA) that contributes to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Laboratory
   studies have revealed that anthropogenic pollutants, such as sulfur
   dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and aerosol acidity, can
   enhance SOA formation from the hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation
   of isoprene; however, the mechanisms by which specific pollutants
   enhance isoprene SOA in ambient PM2.5 remain unclear. As one aspect of
   an investigation to examine how anthropogenic pollutants influence
   isoprene-derived SOA formation, high-volume PM2.5 filter samples were
   collected at the Birmingham, Alabama (BHM), ground site during the 2013
   Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS). Sample extracts were analyzed
   by gas chromatography-electron ionization-mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS)
   with prior trimethylsilylation and ultra performance liquid
   chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization high-resolution
   quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-HR-QTOFMS) to
   identify known isoprene SOA tracers. Tracers quantified using both
   surrogate and authentic standards were compared with collocated gas- and
   particle-phase data as well as meteorological data provided by the
   Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) network to
   assess the impact of anthropogenic pollution on isoprene-derived SOA
   formation. Results of this study reveal that isoprene-derived SOA
   tracers contribute a substantial mass fraction of organic matter (OM) (
   aEuro-7 to aEuro-20aEuro-\%). Isoprene-derived SOA tracers correlated
   with sulfate (SO42-) (r(2) = 0.34, n = 117) but not with NOx. Moderate
   correlations between methacrylic acid epoxide and
   hydroxymethyl-methyl-alpha-lactone (together abbreviated
   MAE/HMML)-derived SOA tracers with nitrate radical production (P{[}NO3])
   (r(2) = 0.57, n = 40) were observed during nighttime, suggesting a
   potential role of the NO3 radical in forming this SOA type. However, the
   nighttime correlation of these tracers with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (r(2)
   = 0.26, n = 40) was weaker. Ozone (O-3) correlated strongly with
   MAE/HMML-derived tracers (r(2) = 0.72, n = 30) and moderately with
   2-methyltetrols (r(2) = 0.34, n = 15) during daytime only, suggesting
   that a fraction of SOA formation could occur from isoprene ozonolysis in
   urban areas. No correlation was observed between aerosol pH and
   isoprene-derived SOA. Lack of correlation between aerosol acidity and
   isoprene-derived SOA is consistent with the observation that acidity is
   not a limiting factor for isoprene SOA formation at the BHM site as
   aerosols were acidic enough to promote multiphase chemistry of
   isoprene-derived epoxides throughout the duration of the study. All in
   all, these results confirm previous studies suggesting that
   anthropogenic pollutants enhance isoprene-derived SOA formation.}},

   aerodynamic diameter < aEuro-1aEuro-A mu m in the planetary boundary
   layer, resulted in relatively low f(RH) values of 1.43aEuro-+/-
   aEuro-0.67 at 70aEuro-\% RH and 2.28aEuro-+/- aEuro-1.05 at 90aEuro-\%
   RH. The subsaturated kappa-Kohler hygroscopicity parameter kappa for the
   organic fraction of the aerosol must have been < aEuro-0.10 to be
   consistent with 75aEuro-\% of the observations within uncertainties,
   with a best estimate of kappa aEuro- = aEuro-0.05. This subsaturated
   kappa value for the organic aerosol in the southeastern US is broadly
   consistent with field studies in rural environments. A new, physically
   based, single-parameter representation was developed that better
   described f(RH) than did the widely used gamma power-law approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Protein sequestration plays an essential role in maintaining stem cell
   populations in the native stem cell niche. Both pluripotent and adult
   stem cells require the sustained presentation of numerous bioactive
   growth factors and other soluble cues to potentiate cell fate decisions
   and morphogenic events. Consequently, methods of natural protein
   sequestration employed by the stem cell niche present attractive
   strategies for developing novel protein delivery vehicles and
   engineering biomimetic stem cell microenvironments that enhance
   morphogen bioactivity. In this review, we will explore the role of
   protein sequestration in the native stem cell niche and how it has
   inspired the design of several classes of materials that exploit natural
   protein sequestration to effectively maintain stem cell populations and
   direct stem cell fate. We will also highlight several recent
   developments in protein sequestering biomaterials, in which material
   strategies to sequester complex mixtures of endogenously secreted
   proteins are also being investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Disease-specific pluripotent stem cells can be derived through genetic
   manipulation of embryonic stem cells or by reprogramming somatic cells
   (induced pluripotent stem cells). These cells are a valuable tool to
   study human diseases in vitro in order to dissect their pathomechanisms
   and develop novel therapeutics. Although pluripotent stem cell-derived
   models have successfully recapitulated the abnormalities of some
   skeletal diseases in vitro, this field is still at its early stages, and
   it could greatly benefit from the direct application of biomaterial
   research. Biomaterial-based systems may be utilized to enhance the
   differentiation processes of pluripotent stem cells in order to create
   more homogeneous and physiologically relevant in vitro disease models.
   Moreover, inducing the disease phenotype may be facilitated by the
   guidance of biomaterials. This review presents a comprehensive summary
   of existing biomaterial applications in human disease modeling and their
   potential on skeletal disease models. By utilizing disease-specific
   pluripotent stem cells, current biomaterial-based systems for in vitro
   models could be extrapolated to study skeletal diseases in a petri dish.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{3490-3503}},
Abstract = {{The bone marrow (BM) niche of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
   (HSPCs) is critical for maintaining homeostasis of the hematopoietic
   system in vivo. It also plays a critical role in many diseases, from
   cancer metastases to immune dysfunctions. While this microenvironment is
   well studied, we still do not have a full understanding of bone marrow
   functions and the HSPC niche. Reconstructing the bone marrow
   microenvironment in vitro using biomaterials has the potential to
   further our understanding of the complex HSPC niche, provide new
   insights on how various cells function within these niches, how complex
   disease processes happens within the BM, and also serve as a tool for
   more efficient generation of high quality, therapeutic hematopoietic and
   mesenchymal cells. Many synthetic and natural materials have been used
   to replicate the known physical and biochemical properties of bone
   marrow. Here we review key components and considerations for designing
   materials to engineer bone marrow niches and study HSPC behavior and
   disease pathologies. We also provide future perspectives on areas where
   new knowledge must be gained to achieve the scientific and clinical
   potential of materials-driven bone marrow niche development.}},

Title = {{Development of a cell delivery system using alginate microbeads for
   tissue regeneration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{3515-3525}},
Abstract = {{Alginate microbeads incorporating adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have
   potential for delivering viable cells capable of facilitating tissue
   regeneration. These microbeads are formed in calcium crosslinking
   solutions containing organic osmolytes to ensure physiological
   osmolality, but the comparative effects of these osmolytes on the
   microencapsulated cells are not known. In addition, delivery parameters
   needed to use microencapsulated cells for tissue regeneration remain
   unknown. We investigated the following parameters: (1) osmolyte effects
   on microbead diameter, cell viability and growth factor production; (2)
   the effect of the number of cells per microbead and the number of
   microbeads per unit volume on cell viability, growth factor production,
   and microbead degradation; (3) the ability of both degradable and
   non-degradable alginate microbeads to localize cells at the delivery
   site in vivo; and (4) whether alginate microbeads containing
   alginate-lyase elicit an inflammatory response after repeated exposure.
   Smallest microbead diameters were achieved using glucose as the osmolyte
   but cell viability and growth factor production did not depend on
   osmolyte type. As cell number per microbead or microbead number per well
   increased, growth factor production per cell decreased although percent
   cell viability was unchanged. The rate of cell release varied with the
   number of beads per well and with the number of cells per microbead. At
   the highest microbead density and at the lowest density of cells per
   microbead, cell release was delayed. Therefore fewer microbeads may be
   sufficient for clinical applications. Both degradable (0.22 U g(-1)) and
   non-degradable (0 U g(-1)) alginate microbeads localized cells at the
   delivery site. Degradable alginate microbeads delivered subcutaneously
   elicited a mild chronic inflammatory response on second exposure, but
   how this might impact repeated use of the technology remains to be
   determined.}},

Title = {{Environmental manipulation to promote stem cell survival in vivo: use of

Abstract = {{While mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based strategies for critically-sized
   bone defect repair hold promise, poor cell survival in vivo remains a
   significant barrier to the translation of these therapeutics. One method
   employed to extend the survival of MSCs is the formation of
   three-dimensional aggregates, a strategy which modulates the
   immunomodulatory secretome of the cells, thereby influencing the local
   inflammatory environment and potentially bone tissue repair. Enrichment
   of cell-seeded hydrogels with oxygen carriers to counter the hypoxic
   conditions encountered in vivo or co-delivery of cells with growth
   factors, are also strategies employed to modulate the cell
   micro-environment. In this study, we examined the effect of human MSC
   (hMSC) and rat MSC (rMSC) aggregation on cell survival and bone tissue
   regeneration within both immunocompromised (nude) and syngeneic (Lewis)
   rat models. Despite a heightened release of paracrine factors from stem
   cell aggregates in vitro, the delivery of hMSC or rMSC aggregates in
   their respective rat models had no beneficial impact on cell survival,
   construct vascularization, or critically-sized bone defect repair.
   Co-delivery of oxygen carrier perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) within the
   alginate hydrogel delivery vehicle impeded in vivo bone regeneration in
   both MSC-seeded and acellular constructs. Although rMSC seeding was
   observed to enhance the osteoinductive potential of bone morphogenetic
   protein 2 (BMP-2)-containing constructs in vitro, co-delivery of rMSC
   and BMP-2 to the femoral defect space attenuated bone repair in vivo
   compared to BMP-2 delivery alone. Overall, despite in vitro evidence to
   the contrary, the present study observed no beneficial effects of these
   delivery strategies on cell-based bone tissue repair.}},

Abstract = {{Existing nanowire electrical characterization tools not only are
   expensive and require sophisticated facilities, but are far too slow to
   enable statistical characterization of highly variable samples. They are
   also generally not compatible with further sorting and processing of
   nanowires. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, solution-based
   electro-orientation-spectroscopy (EOS) method, which is capable of
   automated electrical characterization of individual nanowires by direct
   optical visualization of their alignment behavior under spatially
   uniform electric fields of different frequencies. We demonstrate that
   EOS can quantitatively characterize the electrical conductivities of
   nanowires over a 6-order-of-magnitude range (10(-5) to 10 S m(-1),
   corresponding to typical carrier densities of 10(10)-10(16) cm(-3)),
   with different fluids used to suspend the nanowires. By implementing EOS
   in a simple microfluidic device, continuous electrical characterization
   is achieved, and the sorting of nanowires is demonstrated as a
   proof-of-concept. With measurement speeds two orders of magnitude faster
   than direct-contact methods, the automated EOS instrument enables for
   the first time the statistical characterization of highly variable 1D
   nanomaterials.}},

Title = {{A thermal responsive affinity ligand for precipitation of sialylated
   proteins}},
Journal = {{AIMS BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-102}},
Abstract = {{We report here the development of a thermal responsive affinity ligand
   specific to sialic acid, sialic acid containing oligosaccharides,
   glycoproteins, and other sialylated glycoconjugates. The ligand is a
   fusion protein of 40 repeats of pentapeptide of an elastin like polymer
   (ELP) and the 21 kD sialic acid binding domain of a Vibrio cholera
   neuraminidase (VCNA). For cost-effective synthesis, the fusion protein
   was targeted to the periplasmic space of an E. coli lpp deletion mutant,
   resulting in its secretion to the growth medium. A pre-induction
   heat-shock step at 42 degrees C for 20 minutes was necessary to achieve
   high level expression of the ligand. Under optimized induction condition
   (18 degrees C, 0.1 mM IPTG and 48 hours of post-induction cultivation),
   the ligand was produced to about 100 mg/L. The ligand exhibited a
   transition temperature of 52 degrees C, which could be depressed to 37
   degrees C with the addition of 0.5 M NaCl. Using fetuin as a model
   sialylated protein, the ligand was applied in an affinity precipitation
   process to illustrate its potential application in glycoprotein
   isolation. The ligand captured 100\% fetuin from an aqueous solution
   when the molar ratio of ligand to fetuin was 10 to 1, which was lower
   than the expected for full titration of sialic acid on the glycoprotein
   by the lectin. Elution of fetuin from ligand was achieved with PBS
   buffer containing 2 mM sialic acid. To evaluate how protein and other
   contaminants influence the recovery of sialylated proteins, CHO medium
   was spiked into the fetuin solution. The predominant protein species in
   CHO medium was found to be albumin. Although its removal of over 94\%
   was evident, purified fetuin contained some albumin due to its
   over-abundance. Additional experiments with albumin contaminant of
   varying concentrations showed that below 1 mg/L, albumin had no impact
   on the affinity precipitation, whereas above 10 mg/L, some albumin was
   co-purified with fetuin. However, even at 50 mg/ml, fetuin recovery
   yield remained high (about 90\%) and about 95\% of albumin was depleted
   with only one cycle of precipitation and elution. These results suggest
   that the ligand could be used in initial capture of sialylated proteins
   and to remove over-abundant albumin contaminant. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first thermal responsive sialic acid binding
   protein developed with gene fusion technology.}},

   Stabilized Flames}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{924-952}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive numerical study is conducted to explore the dynamic
   behaviors of a flame stabilized by a triangular bluff body in a straight
   chamber. The formulation accommodates the complete set of conservation
   equations with turbulence closure achieved by a large eddy simulation
   (LES) technique. A G-equation-based level-set flamelet approach is
   employed to model the interactions between premixed combustion and
   turbulence. Both non-reacting and reacting flows are treated, with
   special attention given to the effect of inlet boundary conditions on
   the flame evolution. The flow around the bluff body consists of boundary
   layers, separated shear layers, a recirculation zone and a wake. Their
   mutual coupling, as well as interactions with acoustic motion and flame
   oscillation are analyzed in detail. The physical processes responsible
   for driving combustion instabilities and the mechanism of energy
   transfer from chemical reactions in the flame zone to acoustic
   oscillations in the bulk of the chamber are investigated systematically.
   Intensive resonance is found to occur between shear-layer instabilities
   and chamber acoustic waves, when the acoustically reflecting inlet
   boundary condition is enforced. The resulting complex interplay among
   acoustic motion, vortex shedding, and unsteady heat release forms a
   feedback loop and excites combustion instabilities with large flow
   oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{Charging and coagulation influence one another and impact the particle
   charge and size distributions in the atmosphere. However, few
   investigations to date have focused on the coagulation kinetics of
   atmospheric particles accumulating charge. This study presents three
   approaches to include mutual effects of charging and coagulation on the
   microphysical evolution of atmospheric particles such as radioactive
   particles. The first approach employs ion balance, charge balance, and a
   bivariate population balance model (PBM) to comprehensively calculate
   both charge accumulation and coagulation rates of particles. The second
   approach involves a much simpler description of charging, and uses a
   monovariate PBM and subsequent effects of charge on particle
   coagulation. The third approach is further simplified assuming that
   particles instantaneously reach their steady-state charge distributions.
   It is found that compared to the other two approaches, the first
   approach can accurately predict time-dependent changes in the size and
   charge distributions of particles over a wide size range covering from
   the free molecule to continuum regimes. The other two approaches can
   reliably predict both charge accumulation and coagulation rates for
   particles larger than about 0.04 micrometers and atmospherically
   relevant conditions. These approaches are applied to investigate
   coagulation kinetics of particles accumulating charge in a radioactive
   neutralizer, the urban atmosphere, and an atmospheric system containing
   radioactive particles. Limitations of the approaches are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents one of the first examples of the exploitation of
   3-D printing in the fabrication of microwave components and antennas.
   Additive manufacturing represents an enabling technology for a wide
   range of electronic devices, thanks to its inherent features of fast
   prototyping, the reasonable accuracy, fully 3-D topologies, and the low
   fabrication cost. A novel 3-D printable flexible filament, based on
   NinjaFlex, has been adopted for manufacturing the substrate of a 3-D
   printed patch antenna. NinjaFlex is a recently introduced material with
   extraordinary features in terms of mechanical strain, flexibility, and
   printability. Initially, the electrical properties of this material are
   investigated at 2.4 GHz using the ring resonator technique. The
   capability of selectively changing the dielectric constant by modifying
   the printed material density by fine-tuning printing infill percentage
   is verified experimentally. Subsequently, a square patch antenna is
   prototyped through 3-D printing and measured to validate the
   manufacturing technology. Finally, exploiting mechanical flexibility
   properties of NinjaFlex, the antenna is tested under different bending
   conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Abstract = {{The ability to synthetically tune the size, shape, composition and
   architecture of inorganic nanostructures offers enormous opportunities
   to explore the fundamental structure-property relationships that occur
   uniquely at the nanoscale, and engineer greater functionality and design
   complexity into new material systems. Core/shell nanoparticles represent
   an important class of nanostructured materials that have garnered
   considerable interest. The success in producing core/shell nanoparticles
   with strictly controlled core diameter and shell thickness and tailoring
   their material properties relies crucially on the epitaxial growth of
   the shell material over the highly curved surface of the spherical core.
   However, effective methods to yield such high-quality core/shell
   nanoparticles are comparatively few and limited in scope. Here, we
   develop a robust nonepitaxial growth strategy to create uniform
   plasmonic/semiconducting core/shell nanoparticles with precisely
   controlled dimensions by capitalizing on amphiphilic star-like triblock
   copolymers as nanoreactors. The diameter of the plasmonic core and the
   thickness of the semiconductor shell can be independently and precisely
   regulated by tailoring the molecular weights (i.e., the lengths) of the
   inner and intermediate blocks of star-like triblock copolymers,
   respectively. The successful crafting of plasmonic/semiconducting
   core/shell nanoparticles was corroborated by the composition and
   structural characterizations. These functional nanoparticles exhibited
   largely improved photocatalytic activities, which can be attributed to
   the localized surface plasmon-mediated light harvesting enhancement of
   the plasmonic core and the built-in internal electric field. This
   nonepitaxial growth strategy offers new levels of tailorability in the
   dimensions, compositions and architectures of nanomaterials with
   engineered functionalities for applications in catalytic, electronic,
   optic, optoelectronic and sensory materials and devices.}},

Abstract = {{While porous metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (PMS-SOFCs) have
   potential to dramatically reduce the cost while enhancing the durability
   of SOFC technology, the available fabrication processes are still
   cumbersome and unsuitable for commercial applications. Here, we report
   our findings in exploring low-cost, additive, thermal spray processes
   suitable for large-scale manufacturing of PMS-SOFCs. The additive
   fabrication process starts with a porous metal support, on which a
   porous nickel-based anode layer and a dense electrolyte membrane are
   sequentially deposited. Then, a nanostructured
   La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode layer is applied using a
   liquid precursor high velocity oxygen fuel flame (LP-HVOF) spraying
   process. The polarization resistance of the LSCF cathode is reduced to
   0.15 Omega cm2 at 600 degrees C and 0.025 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C.
   The PMS-SOFCs display excellent performance, demonstrating peak power
   densities of 0.23, 0.65, 1.1, and 1.5 W cm(-2) at 500, 600, 700, and 750
   degrees C, respectively, while maintaining impressive stability (no
   observable change for more than 600 h at 650 degrees C). Our results
   suggest that thermal spraying has potential to be a low-cost and
   flexible process suitable for large-scale fabrication of commercial
   PMS-SOFCs.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mesoporous electrodes in solid oxide cells would lead to a
   significant enhancement of the performance due to their high surface
   area and large number of active sites for electrochemical reactions.
   However, their application in real devices is still hindered by the
   potential instability of the mesostructure and morphology at high
   temperatures required for device fabrication and under severe conditions
   for high-current, long-term operation. Here we report our findings on
   the preparation and characterization of mesoporous electrodes based on
   ceria infiltrated with catalysts: an anode consisting of a
   Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) scaffold infiltrated with Ni and a cathode
   consisting of an SDC scaffold infiltrated with Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta
   (SSC). In particular, a doped-zirconia electrolyte supported cell with a
   mesoporous Ni-SDC anode and a mesoporous SSC-SDC cathode demonstrates an
   excellent peak power density of 565 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C (using
   humidified hydrogen as the fuel). More importantly, both mesoporous
   electrodes display remarkable stability, yielding a combined electrode
   virtual non-degradation for the last 500 hours of the test at a constant
   current density of 635 mA cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, demonstrating the
   potential of these mesoporous materials as robust electrodes for solid
   oxide fuel cells or other high-temperature electrochemical energy
   storage and conversion devices.}},

   are activated by biologically produced light through luciferases upon
   peripheral injection of a small molecule substrate. Such luminescent
   opsins, luminopsins, allow conventional fiber optic use of optogenetic
   sensors, while at the same time providing chemogenetic access to the

Abstract = {{Near-field thermophotovoltaic (NFTPV) devices have received much
   attention lately as attractive energy harvesting systems, whereby a
   heated thermal emitter exchanges super-Planckian near-field radiation
   with a photovoltaic (PV) cell to generate electricity. This work
   describes the use of a grating structure to enhance the power throughput
   of NFTPV devices, while increasing thermal efficiency by ensuring that a
   large portion of the radiation entering the PV cell is above the
   bandgap. The device is modeled as a one-dimensional high temperature
   tungsten grating on a tungsten substrate that radiates photons to a
   room-temperature In0.18Ga0.82Sb PV cell through a vacuum gap of several
   tens of nanometers. Scattering theory is used along with the rigorous
   coupled wave analysis to calculate the radiation exchange between the
   grating emitter and the PV cell. A parametric study is performed by
   varying the grating depth, period, and ridge width in the range that can
   be fabricated using available fabrication technologies. By optimizing
   the grating parameters, it is found that the power output can be
   improved by 40\% while increasing the energy efficiency by 6\% as
   compared with the case of a flat tungsten emitter. Reasons for the
   enhancement are investigated and found to be due to the surface plasmon
   polariton resonance, which shifts towards lower frequencies. This work
   shows a possible way of improving NFTPV and sheds light on how grating
   structures interact with thermal radiation at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of certain components of particulate matter to induce
   oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   in vivo may be one mechanism accounting for observed linkages between
   ambient aerosols and adverse health outcomes. A variety of assays have
   been used to measure this so-called aerosol oxidative potential. We
   developed a semi-automated system to quantify oxidative potential of
   filter aqueous extracts utilizing the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay and
   report here the development of a similar semi-automated system for the
   ascorbic acid (AA) assay. Approximately 500 PM2.5 filter samples
   collected in contrasting locations in the southeastern US were analyzed
   for a host of aerosol species, along with AA and DTT activities. We
   present a detailed contrast in findings from these two assays.
   Water-soluble AA activity was higher in summer and fall than in winter,
   with highest levels near heavily trafficked highways, whereas DTT
   activity was higher in winter compared to summer and fall and more
   spatially homogeneous. AA activity was nearly exclusively correlated
   with water-soluble Cu (raEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-0.70-0.94
   at most sites), whereas DTT activity was correlated with organic and
   metal species. Source apportionment models, positive matrix
   factorization (PMF) and a chemical mass balance method with
   ensemble-averaged source impact profiles (CMB-E), suggest a strong
   contribution from traffic emissions and secondary processes (e.g.,
   organic aerosol oxidation or metals mobilization by secondary acids) to
   both AA and DTT activities in urban Atlanta. In contrast, biomass
   burning was a large source for DTT activity, but insignificant for AA.
   AA activity was not correlated with PM2.5 mass, while DTT activity
   co-varied strongly with mass (raEuro-aEuro parts per thousand=
   aEuro-0.49-0.86 across sites and seasons). Various linear models were
   developed to estimate AA and DTT activities for the central Atlanta
   Jefferson Street site, based on the CMB-E sources. The models were then
   used to estimate daily oxidative potential at this site over the
   1998-2009 period. Time series epidemiological analyses were conducted to
   assess daily emergency department (ED) visits data for the five-county
   Atlanta metropolitan area based on the estimated 10-year backcast
   oxidative potential. Estimated AA activity was not statistically
   associated with any tested health outcome, while DTT activity was
   associated with ED visits for both asthma or wheeze and congestive heart
   failure. The findings point to the importance of both organic components
   and transition metals from biomass burning and mobile sources to adverse
   health outcomes in this region.}},

Abstract = {{A simple statistical model to predict the number of aerosols which
   activate to form cloud droplets in warm clouds has been established,
   based on regression analysis of data from four summertime Cloud and
   Aerosol Characterisation Experiments (CLACE) at the high-altitude site
   Jungfraujoch (JFJ). It is shown that 79aEuro-\% of the observed variance
   in droplet numbers can be represented by a model accounting only for the
   number of potential cloud condensation nuclei (defined as number of
   particles larger than 80aEuro-nm in diameter), while the mean errors in
   the model representation may be reduced by the addition of further
   explanatory variables, such as the mixing ratios of O-3, CO, and the
   height of the measurements above cloud base. The statistical model has a
   similar ability to represent the observed droplet numbers in each of the
   individual years, as well as for the two predominant local wind
   directions at the JFJ (northwest and southeast). Given the central
   European location of the JFJ, with air masses in summer being
   representative of the free troposphere with regular boundary layer
   in-mixing via convection, we expect that this statistical model is
   generally applicable to warm clouds under conditions where droplet
   formation is aerosol limited (i.e. at relatively high updraught
   velocities and/or relatively low aerosol number concentrations). A
   comparison between the statistical model and an established
   microphysical parametrization shows good agreement between the two and
   supports the conclusion that cloud droplet formation at the JFJ is
   predominantly controlled by the number concentration of aerosol
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{As automation increasingly takes over functions requiring humans' skill-
   and rule-based behaviors, effective human-automation interaction
   increasingly depends upon human reasoning about when the automation
   should be disengaged. This paper uses the aircraft traffic alert and
   collision avoidance system (TCAS) as a case study where the pilot needs
   to decide how to respond to decision automation that generates collision
   avoidance advisories commanding vertical maneuvers. Of note, recent
   installations of TCAS can now automatically execute the advisories,
   potentially to improve compliance with TCAS advisories. This paper
   describes a Human-in-the-loop flight simulator study examining pilots'
   interaction with the automatic execution of advisories, including
   situations in which pilots chose to disengage it. While overall
   automatic execution appears to improve compliance to TCAS advisories in
   the aggregate, it was also disengaged in some of the same situations in
   which pilots historically had not manually flown compliant avoidance
   maneuvers. Further, the autopilot's subsequent reversionary mode
   settings after following the TCAS advisory may not be appropriate for
   returning to air traffic clearances. These results highlight the
   importance of designing automation to support effective pilot reasoning
   about traffic events, a task that remains in place while the pilot
   remains ultimately responsible for safety.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{137-180}},
Abstract = {{Garbled circuits provide a powerful tool for jointly evaluating
   functions while preserving the privacy of each user's inputs. While
   recent research has made the use of this primitive more practical, such
   solutions generally assume that participants are symmetrically
   provisioned with massive computing resources. In reality, most people on
   the planet only have access to the comparatively sparse computational
   resources associated with their mobile phones, and those willing and
   able to pay for access to public cloud computing infrastructure cannot
   be assured that their data will remain unexposed. We address this
   problem by creating a new SFE protocol that allows mobile devices to
   securely outsource the majority of computation required to evaluate a
   garbled circuit. Our protocol, which builds on the most efficient
   garbled circuit evaluation techniques, includes a new outsourced
   oblivious transfer primitive that requires significantly less bandwidth
   and computation than standard OT primitives and outsourced input
   validation techniques that force the cloud to prove that it is executing
   all protocols correctly. After showing that our extensions are secure in
   the malicious model, we conduct an extensive performance evaluation for
   a number of standard SFE test applications as well as a
   privacy-preserving navigation application designed specifically for the
   mobile use-case. Our system reduces execution time by 98.92\% and
   bandwidth by 99.95\% for the edit distance problem of size 128 compared
   to non-outsourced evaluation. These results show that even the least
   capable devices are capable of using large garbled circuits for secure
   computation.}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to demonstrate that teaching healthcare
   trainees a formal search or scan pattern for evaluation of the lungs
   improves their ability to identify pulmonary nodules on chest
   radiographs (CXRs). A group of physician assistant trainees were
   randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Each group was
   shown two sets of CXRs, each set with a nodule prevalence of
   approximately 50\%. The experimental group received search pattern
   training between case sets, whereas the control group did not. Both
   groups were asked to mark nodules when present and indicate their
   diagnostic confidence. Subject performance at nodule detection was
   quantified using changes in area under the localization receiver
   operating characteristic curve (Delta AUC). There was no significant
   improvement in performance between case sets for the control group.
   There was a significant improvement in subject performance after
   training for the experimental group, Delta AUC = 0.1539, p = 0.0012.
   These results demonstrate that teaching a search pattern to trainees
   improves their ability to identify nodules and decreases the number of
   perceptual errors in nodule identification, and suggest that our
   knowledge of medical image perception may be used to develop rational
   tools for the education of healthcare trainees. (C) 2015 Society of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pattern-integrated interference lithography (PIIL) combines multibeam
   interference lithography and projection lithography simultaneously to
   produce two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D)
   periodiclattice-based microstructures in a rapid, single-exposure step.
   Using a comprehensive PIIL vector model and realistic photolithographic
   conditions, PIIL exposures for a representative photonic-crystal (PhC)
   90 deg bend waveguide are simulated in the volume of the photoresist
   film. The etched structures in the underlying substrate are estimated as
   well. Due to the imperfect integration of the photomask within the
   interference pattern, the interference pattern is locally distorted,
   thereby impacting the PhC periodic lattice and potentially the device
   performance. To mitigate these distortions, a photomask optimization
   method for PIIL is presented in this work. With an improved photomask,
   pillar-area and pillar-displacement errors in the vicinity of the
   waveguide are reduced by factors of 3.3 and 2.7, respectively.
   Furthermore, calculated transmission spectra show that the performance
   of the PIIL-produced PhC device is as good as that of its idealized
   equivalent. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art block copolymer (BCP)-directed self-assembly (DSA)
   methods still yield defect densities orders of magnitude higher than is
   necessary in semiconductor fabrication despite free-energy calculations
   that suggest equilibrium defect densities are much lower than is
   necessary for economic fabrication. This disparity suggests that the
   main problem may lie in the kinetics of defect removal. This work uses a
   coarse-grained model to study the rates, pathways, and dependencies of
   healing a common defect to give insight into the fundamental processes
   that control defect healing and give guidance on optimal process
   conditions for BCP-DSA. It is found that bulk simulations yield an
   exponential drop in defect heal rate above chi N similar to 30. Thin
   films show no change in rate associated with the energy barrier below
   chi N similar to 50, significantly higher than the chi N values found
   previously for self-consistent field theory studies that neglect
   fluctuations. Above chi N similar to 50, the simulations show an
   increase in energy barrier scaling with 1/2 to 1/3 of the bulk systems.
   This is because thin films always begin healing at the free interface or
   the BCP-underlayer interface, where the increased A - B contact area
   associated with the transition state is minimized, while the infinitely
   thick films cannot begin healing at an interface. (C) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {{In vitro antibody display and screening technologies geared toward the
   discovery and engineering of clinically applicable antibodies have
   evolved from screening artificial antibody formats, powered by microbial
   display technologies, to screening of natural, full-IgG molecules
   expressed in mammalian cells to readily yield lead antibodies with
   favorable properties in production and clinical applications. Here, we
   report the development and characterization of a novel, next-generation
   mammalian cell-based antibody display and screening platform called
   Transpo-mAb Display, offering straightforward and efficient generation
   of cellular libraries by using non-viral transposition technology to
   obtain stable antibody expression. Because Transpo-mAb Display uses
   DNA-transposable vectors with substantial cargo capacity, genomic
   antibody heavy chain expression constructs can be utilized that undergo
   the natural switch from membrane bound to secreted antibody expression
   in B cells by way of alternative splicing of Ig-heavy chain transcripts
   from the same genomic expression cassette. We demonstrate that stably
   transposed cells co-express transmembrane and secreted antibodies at
   levels comparable to those provided by dedicated constructs for secreted
   and membrane-associated IgGs. This unique feature expedites the
   screening and antibody characterization process by obviating the need
   for intermediate sequencing and re-cloning of individual antibody clones
   into separate expression vectors for functional screening purposes. In a
   series of proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the seamless
   integration of antibody discovery with functional screening for various
   antibody properties, including binding affinity and suitability for
   preparation of antibody-drug conjugates.}},

Abstract = {{The growing uncertainty associated with the increasing penetration of
   wind and solar power generation has presented new challenges to the
   operation of large-scale electric power systems. Motivated by these
   challenges, we present a multistage adaptive robust optimization model
   for the most critical daily operational problem of power systems,
   namely, the unit commitment (UC) problem, in the situation where nodal
   net electricity loads are uncertain. The proposed multistage robust UC
   model takes into account the time causality of the hourly unfolding of
   uncertainty in the power system operation process, which we show to be
   relevant when ramping capacities are limited and net loads present
   significant variability. To deal with large-scale systems, we explore
   the idea of simplified affine policies and develop a solution method
   based on constraint generation. Extensive computational experiments on
   the IEEE 118-bus test case and a real-world power system with 2,736
   buses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in handling
   large-scale power systems and that the proposed multistage robust UC
   model can significantly outperform the deterministic UC and existing
   two-stage robust UC models in both operational cost and system

Abstract = {{Multiphase flow phenomena in single micro- and mini-channels have been
   widely studied. Microchannel heat exchangers offer the potential for
   high heat transfer coefficients; however, implementation challenges must
   be addressed to realize this potential. Maldistribution of phases among
   the microchannels in the array and the changing phase velocities
   associated phase change present design challenges. Flow maldistribution
   and oscillatory instabilities can severely affect heat and mass transfer
   rates as well as pressure drops. In components such as condensers,
   evaporators, absorbers and desorbers, changing phase velocities can
   change prevailing flow regimes from favorable to unfavorable. Geometries
   with serpentine passages containing pin fins can be configured to
   maintain favorable flow regimes throughout the length of the component
   for diabatic phase-change heat and mass transfer applications. Due to
   the possibility of continuous redistribution of the flow across the pin
   fins along the flow direction, maldistribution can also be reduced.
   These features enable the potential of high heat transfer coefficients
   in microscale passages to be fully realized, thereby reducing the
   required transfer area, and achieving considerable compactness. The
   characteristics of two-phase flow through a serpentine passage with
   micro-pin fin arrays with diameters 350 mu m and height 406 mu m are
   investigated here. An air-water mixture is used to represent two-phase
   flow through the serpentine test section, and a variety of flow features
   are visually investigated using high-speed photography. Improved flow
   distribution is observed in the serpentine geometry. Distinct flow
   regimes, different from those observed in microchannels are also
   established. These observations are used to obtain void fraction and
   interfacial area along the length of the serpentine passages and
   compared with the corresponding values for straight microchannels.
   Models for the two-phase frictional pressure drops across this geometry
   are also developed.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional forced convective heat transfer in a bi-porous
   metal foam heat sink is numerically investigated. Each of the metal foam
   layers has a distinct thickness, porosity, and pore density. The effects
   of these geometrical and morphological parameters on fluid flow and heat
   transfer are analyzed by employing the Forchheimer-Brinkman extended
   Darcy momentum equation and local thermal non-equilibrium energy
   equation. The numerical results show that the thermal resistance of the
   bi-porous metal foam heat sink is decreased with reduction in top
   layer,metal foam porosity, as well as the bottom layer metal foam
   thickness, for a fixed bottom metal foam porosity of 0.9. The best
   thermal performance is achieved by employing a 30PPI metal foam at the
   bottom layer, and a 50PPI metal foam at the top layer. The optimal
   thickness of the bottom foam layer is about 1mm.}},

Abstract = {{Fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, link their bodies together to form
   structures such as rafts, bivouacs and bridges. Such structures are in
   danger of being damaged by natural disturbances such as passing water
   currents. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we
   investigate the self-healing of ant assemblages. We press two ant
   aggregations together and measure the forces to pull them apart. As the
   group size increases, the contribution of each ant decreases. This
   phenomenon, known as the Ringelmann effect, or social loafing, has
   previously been shown for cattle and humans. In this study, we show that
   it is a challenge for ants as well. We rationalize this effect with an
   agent-based simulation which exhibits the Ringelmann effect of ants that
   periodically make and break links with each other, but grip with higher
   probability if the ants are stretched. Over time, ants compensate for
   the Ringelmann effect by building more links. We use a mathematical
   model to show that the rate of new links is proportional to the number
   of free ants in the cluster. The principles found here may inspire new
   directions in self-healing and active materials.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in computational power, simulation-based experiments of
   complex problems remain time-consuming. Significant efforts are required
   to define an accurate representation of the problem and draw relevant
   conclusions about relationships between input parameters and output
   performance measures. To reduce the computational burden without
   sacrificing accuracy, it is customary to design a set of relevant
   scenarios. Doing so necessitates that the problem be decomposed into
   relevant parameters and that the consistency of these parameters be
   analyzed. To address this challenge, we propose a multilevel
   probabilistic morphological analysis. Traditionally, morphological
   analysis documents the decomposition of a system into its main
   components, and performs binary compatibility assessments to document
   relational data between component options. However, this approach leads
   to a rigid definition of the problem space and a static solution space
   that does not account for uncertain and dynamic behaviors associated
   with complex systems-of-systems. This research incorporates two
   important improvements. First, it explicitly incorporates a multilevel
   approach accommodating any successive decomposition steps that may be
   required when dealing with a complex system-of-systems problem. Second,
   this research introduces probabilistic cross-consistency assessments
   instead of traditional binary assessments to account for uncertain
   future states of the world. This probabilistic scheme is used to
   describe degrees of likelihood that two elements may coexist in a given
   scenario. This way, more complex interactions may also be captured and
   more realistic scenarios may be defined. Finally, the proposed method is
   applied to a problem investigating the design of architectures of
   detection systems for the protection of homeland critical assets.}},

Abstract = {{We report herein the exceptional cycle stability of lithium cobalt oxide

   that LCO, when in contact with each of the aqueous electrolytes tested,
   exhibits a high electrode potential and a large initial discharge
   capacity, similar to that of LCO electrochemically cycled in
   conventional organic electrolytes. More importantly, our systematic
   studies and post-mortem analyses of LCO cells reveal that the primary
   mechanism of LCO degradation in aqueous electrolytes is the formation of
   a resistive layer of cobalt(II) oxide on the particles' surfaces. We
   show that higher electrolyte molarity and certain salt compositions may

Title = {{Semiconducting organic-inorganic nanocomposites by intimately tethering
   conjugated polymers to inorganic tetrapods}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{8887-8898}},
Abstract = {{Semiconducting organic-inorganic nanocomposites were judiciously crafted
   by placing conjugated polymers in intimate contact with inorganic
   tetrapods via click reaction. CdSe tetrapods were first synthesized by
   inducing elongated arms from CdSe zincblende seeds through seed-mediated
   growth. The subsequent effective inorganic ligand treatment, followed by
   reacting with short bifunctional ligands, yielded azide-functionalized
   CdSe tetrapods (i.e., CdSe-N-3). Finally, the ethynyl-terminated
   conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (i.e., P3HT-u) was tethered to
   CdSe-N3 tetrapods via a catalyst-free alkyne-azide cycloaddition,
   forming intimate semiconducting P3HT-CdSe tetrapod nanocomposites.
   Intriguingly, the intimate contact between P3HT and CdSe tetrapod was
   found to not only render the effective dispersion of CdSe tetrapods in
   the P3HT matrix, but also facilitate the efficient electronic
   interaction between these two semiconducting constituents. The
   successful anchoring of P3HT chains onto CdSe tetrapods was
   substantiated through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. Moreover, the
   absorption and photoluminescence studies further corroborated the
   intimate tethering between P3HT and CdSe tetrapods. The effect of the
   type of bifunctional ligands (i.e., aryl vs. aliphatic ligands) and the
   size of tetrapods on the device performance of hybrid organic-inorganic
   solar cells was also scrutinized. Interestingly, P3HT-CdSe tetrapod
   nanocomposites produced via the use of an aryl bifunctional ligand
   (i.e., 4-azidobenzoic acid) exhibited an improved photovoltaic
   performance compared to that synthesized with their aliphatic ligand
   counterpart (i.e., 5-bromovaleric acid). Clearly, the optimal size of
   CdSe tetrapods ensuring the effective charge transport in conjunction
   with the good dispersion of CdSe tetrapods rendered an improved device
   performance. We envision that the click-reaction strategy enabled by
   capitalizing on two consecutive effective ligand exchanges (i.e.,
   inorganic ligand treatment and subsequent bifunctional ligand exchange)
   to yield intimately connected organic-inorganic nanocomposites provides
   a unique platform for developing functional optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{This study unveils the stress relaxation transient deformation
   mechanisms in 100 nm-thick, nanocrystalline Au films thanks to a robust
   quantitative in situ TEM MEMS nanomechanical testing approach to
   quantify stress relaxation and to perform in situ observations of
   time-dependent deformation in ultrathin nanocrystalline films. The
   relaxation is characterized by a decrease in plastic strain rate of more
   than one order of magnitude over the first similar to 30 minutes (from
   10(-4) to less than 10(-5) s(-1)). For longer relaxation experiments,
   the plastic strain rate decreases down to 10(-7) s(-1) after several
   hours. The power-law exponent n, relating plastic strain rate and
   stress, continuously decreases from initial large values (n from 6 to 14
   at t = 0) down to low values (n similar to 1-2) after several hours. In
   situ TEM observations reveal that the relaxation behavior is initially
   accommodated by highly localized, sustained, intergranular and
   transgranular dislocation motion. Over time, the dislocation sources
   become less operative or exhausted, leading to a transition to
   grain-boundary-diffusion based mechanisms. The results also highlight a
   promising technique for nanoscale characterization of time-dependent
   deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to
   examine several structural and dynamical characteristics in blend
   SPEEK-SPPO based membranes at varied water content and temperature
   values. QM results showed that water molecules were localized around the
   SPEEK and SPPO sulfonate groups due to the hydrogen bonding
   interactions, which caused proton dissociation at the increased
   hydrations. By increasing the hydration level, more water molecules
   occupied the sulfonate fragments because of the improved sulfonate-water
   interactions, whereas the hydrogen bond interaction of
   sulfonate-hydronium ion was weakened, enabling the hydronium ions to be
   away from the sulfonate groups. Based on water cluster size distribution
   and structure factor evaluations, it seemed that by improving the water
   content, isolated smaller aqueous clusters appeared under lower
   hydration levels, which merged together to form larger clusters
   comprising almost all molecules. Diffusivities for water and hydronium
   ion were observed to be enhanced by an increase in water uptake, which
   were attributed to the fact that larger hydrophilic clusters across the
   swollen blend SPEEK-SPPO PEMs promoted molecular mobility. Similarly,
   enhancing operational temperature gave rise to an enhancement in the
   membrane transport dynamics. Finally, predicted water and hydronium ion
   diffusion coefficients were noted to be smaller in hydrated SPEEK-SPPO
   membrane as compared to Nafion under identical conditions, which was in
   agreement with the experimental results.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{42}},
Pages = {{35847-35854}},
Abstract = {{Polymer-based materials have widely been used for electronics packaging
   owing to their excellent physical and chemical properties. However,
   polymer materials usually have low thermal conductivity, which thus may
   impair the performance and reliability of modern electronics. In this
   paper, we report an epoxy-based composite with increased thermal
   conductivity by using graphene oxide-encapsulated boron nitride
   (h-BN@GO) hybrids as fillers. The thermal conductivity of the obtained
   composites increased with the loading of h-BN@GO hybrids to a maximum of
   2.23 W m(-1) K-1 when the loading of h-BN@GO hybrids was 40 wt\%, which
   is double that of composites filled with h-BN. This increase is
   attributed to the presence of GO, which improved the compatibility of
   h-BN with epoxy resin, along with the reduced interfacial thermal
   resistance between h-BN and epoxy resin. In addition, the effects of
   h-BN@GO hybrids on the thermal and dielectric properties of epoxy
   composites were also investigated. The prepared h-BN@GO/epoxy composites
   exhibit outstanding performance in dimensional stability, slightly
   reduced thermal stability, and enhanced dielectric properties, which
   make them suitable as excellent electronics packaging materials.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{39587-39594}},
Abstract = {{We used density functional theory to investigate the band gap and the
   electron conductivity of edge-defect zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNR).
   The band structures of edge-oxidized ZGNRs (ox-ZGNRs) were hardly
   affected by introducing carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, but were markedly
   altered near the Fermi level by the ketone and ether groups, resulting
   in open band gaps of 0.6064 eV and 0.6413 eV, respectively. Unlike
   carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, the ketone and ether groups caused
   noticeable changes due to disruption of the sp2 hybridization of edge
   carbon atoms via forming chemical bonds with them. While the band gaps
   for both-side pyridinic and pyrrolic edge-nitrided ZGNRs (N-ZGNRs)
   holding aromatic forms are respectively calculated to 0.2882 eV and
   0.3057 eV, the non-aromatic graphitic group has a higher band gap of
   0.4244 eV. The edge-aromatic ZGNRs including carboxyl or hydroxyl groups
   in ox-ZGNRs and pyridinic or pyrrolic groups in N-ZGNRs show similar
   features of band structures and properties as displayed in a pristine
   ZGNR. On the contrary, the edge-nonaromatic ZGNRs modified with ketone,
   ether, or graphitic groups have different shapes of the band structures
   whose band gaps are more open than that of a pristine ZGNR.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{41630-41636}},
Abstract = {{The development of thermally conductive polymer composites is of
   critical importance to address the issue of heat aggregation in modern
   electronics with rapid-increasing power density. However, the thermal
   conductivity (K) of the polymer composites has long been limited to
   within 10 W m(-1) K-1 due to the high interfacial thermal resistance.
   Herein, we have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in K upon the
   incorporation of boron nitride nanosheets doped with silver
   nanoparticles hybrids (BNNSs/AgNPs). The incorporation of BNNSs/AgNPs
   into liquid crystalline epoxy resin (LCER) yields an in-plane K of 12.55
   W m(-1) K-1 with 25.1 vol\% boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs). The
   interfacial thermal resistance among BNNSs has demonstrated to reduce by
   sintering silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) deposited on the surface of
   BNNSs, forming more thermally conductive networks with higher K. As a
   proof of concept application, the obtained composite was used as the
   substrate for light-emitting-diode chips and was demonstrated to be more
   effective in heat removal than the bulk LCER. This study establishes an
   efficient approach to prepare thermally conductive composites, which can
   be applied in the next generation of integrated circuits and
   three-dimensional electronics.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{4579-4591}},
Abstract = {{Particle water (liquid water content, LWC) and aerosol pH are important
   parameters of the aerosol phase, affecting heterogeneous chemistry and
   bioavailability of nutrients that profoundly impact cloud formation,
   atmospheric composition, and atmospheric fluxes of nutrients to
   ecosystems. Few measurements of in situ LWC and pH, however, exist in
   the published literature. Using concurrent measurements of aerosol
   chemical composition, cloud condensation nuclei activity, and tandem
   light scattering coefficients, the particle water mass concentrations
   associated with the aerosol inorganic (W-inorg) and organic (W-org)
   components are determined for measurements conducted at the Finokalia
   atmospheric observation station in the eastern Mediterranean between
   June and November 2012. These data are interpreted using the
   ISORROPIA-II thermodynamic model to predict the pH of aerosols
   originating from the various sources that influence air quality in the
   region. On average, closure between predicted aerosol water and that
   determined by comparison of ambient with dry light scattering
   coefficients was achieved to within 8aEuro-\% (slopeaEuro-aEuro parts
   per thousand= aEuro-0.92, R(2)aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-0.8,
   naEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-5201 points). Based on the
   scattering measurements, a parameterization is also derived, capable of
   reproducing the hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)) within 15aEuro-\% of
   the measured values. The highest aerosol water concentrations are
   observed during nighttime, when relative humidity is highest and the
   collapse of the boundary layer increases the aerosol concentration. A
   significant diurnal variability is found for W-org with morning and
   afternoon average mass concentrations being 10-15 times lower than
   nighttime concentrations, thus rendering W-inorg the main form of
   particle water during daytime. The average value of total aerosol water
   was 2.19aEuro-+/- aEuro-1.75aEuro-A mu gaEuro-m(-3), contributing on
   average up to 33aEuro-\% of the total submicron mass concentration.
   Average aerosol water associated with organics, W-org, was equal to
   0.56aEuro-A +/- aEuro-0.37aEuro-A mu gaEuro-m(-3); thus, organics
   contributed about 27.5aEuro-\% to the total aerosol water, mostly during
   early morning, late evening, and nighttime hours.
   The aerosol was found to be highly acidic with calculated aerosol pH
   varying from 0.5 to 2.8 throughout the study period. Biomass burning
   aerosol presented the highest values of pH in the submicron fraction and
   the lowest values in total water mass concentration. The low pH values
   observed in the submicron mode and independently of air mass origin
   could increase nutrient availability and especially P solubility, which
   is the nutrient limiting sea water productivity of the eastern
   Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{Job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a typical NP-hard problem. In
   order to improve the solving efficiency for JSSP, a hybrid differential
   evolution and estimation of distribution algorithm based on
   neighbourhood search is proposed in this paper, which combines the
   merits of Estimation of distribution algorithm and Differential
   evolution (DE). Meanwhile, to strengthen the searching ability of the
   proposed algorithm, a chaotic strategy is introduced to update the
   parameters of DE. Two mutation operators are adopted. A neighbourhood
   search (NS) algorithm based on blocks on critical path is used to
   further improve the solution quality. Finally, the parametric
   sensitivity of the proposed algorithm has been analysed based on the
   Taguchi method of design of experiment. The proposed algorithm was
   tested through a set of typical benchmark problems of JSSP. The results
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving
   JSSP.}},

Title = {{Recent Progress in Triboelectric Nanogenerators as a Renewable and
   Sustainable Power Source}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The newly developed triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provide an
   excellent approach to convert mechanical energy into electricity, which
   are mainly based on the coupling between triboelectrification and
   electrostatic induction. The TENG has the potential of harvesting many
   kinds of mechanical energies such as vibration, rotation, wind, human
   motion, and even water wave energy, which could be a new paradigm for
   scavenging large scale energy. It also demonstrates a possible route
   towards practical applications for powering electronic devices. This
   paper presents a comprehensive review of the four modes of TENGs:
   vertical contact-separation mode, in-plane sliding mode,
   single-electrode mode, and free-standing triboelectric-layer mode. The
   performance enhancements of TENGs for harvesting energy as a sustainable
   power source are also discussed. In addition, recent reports on the
   hybridized nanogenerator are introduced, which may enable fully
   self-powered electronic devices. Finally, the practical applications of
   TENGs for energy harvesting are presented.}},

Pages = {{822-829}},
Abstract = {{Civil infrastructure facilities play a central role in the economic,
   social and political health of modern society. Such facilities are
   susceptible to ageing, which is stochastic in nature and makes their
   reliabilities time dependent. Life-cycle engineering analysis and
   risk-informed decision tools have advanced in recent years for managing
   public investments in performance assurance and risk mitigation of civil
   infrastructure. However, certain civil infrastructure projects may be
   designed for service periods that are substantially longer than what has
   been typically expected of buildings, bridges and similar facilities,
   extending the potential consequences of life-cycle engineering decisions
   far beyond the limits for which there is practical experience. Current
   assessment procedures will require modification to evaluate performance
   of civil infrastructure facilities over extended time frames and to
   support sustainable and equitable decisions affecting long-term public
   safety. This paper considers a number of key issues that must be
   addressed in life-cycle reliability assessment of civil infrastructure
   facilities that must remain functional for service periods of several
   generations, and introduces perspectives on risk that are germane to
   ensure sustainability and intergenerational equity in risk-informed
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite-structured (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3) LSCF has been widely
   studied as a cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide
   fuel cells. However, the application of LSCF cathode is likely to be
   limited by its sluggish surface catalytic properties and long-term
   stability issues. Oxygen hyper-stoichiometric La2NiO4+delta with K2NiF4
   structure exhibits higher catalytic properties, ionic conductivity, and
   stability in comparison with LSCF cathode. Due to the good chemical
   compatibility of these two cathode materials, it is possible to prepare
   a composite cathode by the infiltration of La2NiO4+delta in the porous
   LSCF. This composite structure fully utilizes the advantages of the two
   cathodes and enhances the LSCF cathode performance. In this study, the
   LSCF cathode was deposited by using an atmospheric plasma spray
   technique, and the porous LSCF cathode was then infiltrated by
   La2NiO4+delta. The atmospheric plasma spray technique was used to reduce
   the SOFC manufacturing cost. The microstructure of coatings was
   characterized by SEM and EDS. The cathode polarization resistance was
   found to decrease by similar to 40\% after the La2NiO4+delta
   infiltration. Also, the activation energy decreased from 1.53 to 1.40
   eV.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{1350-1357}},
Abstract = {{Numerous biophysical and biochemical assays rely on spatial manipulation
   of particles/cells as they are processed on lab-on-a-chip devices.
   Analysis of spatially distributed particles on these devices typically
   requires microscopy negating the cost and size advantages of
   microfluidic assays. In this paper, we introduce a scalable electronic
   sensor technology, called microfluidic CODES, that utilizes resistive
   pulse sensing to orthogonally detect particles in multiple microfluidic
   channels from a single electrical output. Combining the techniques from
   telecommunications and microfluidics, we route three coplanar electrodes
   on a glass substrate to create multiple Coulter counters producing
   distinct orthogonal digital codes when they detect particles. We
   specifically design a digital code set using the mathematical principles
   of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) telecommunication networks and
   can decode signals from different microfluidic channels with > 90\%
   accuracy through computation even if these signals overlap. As a proof
   of principle, we use this technology to detect human ovarian cancer
   cells in four different microfluidic channels fabricated using soft
   lithography. Microfluidic CODES offers a simple, all-electronic
   interface that is well suited to create integrated, low-cost
   lab-on-a-chip devices for cell-or particle-based assays in
   resource-limited settings.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed matrix membranes are promising options for improving gas
   separation processes. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have a
   porous structure similar to conventional zeolites, being capable in
   principle of separating gases based on their differences in kinetic
   diameter while offering the advantage of having a partial organic
   character. This partial organic nature improves the compatibility
   between the sieve and the polymer, and a combination of the mentioned
   characteristics makes these hybrid materials interesting for the
   preparation of mixed matrix gas separation membranes. In this context
   the present work reports the preparation of Ultem (R)/ZIF-8 mixed matrix
   membranes and their permeabilities to pure CO2, N-2 and CH4 gases. A
   significant increase in permeability with increase in CO2/N-2
   selectivity was observed for the mixed matrix systems as compared to the
   properties of the neat Ultem (R). Sorption results allowed to speculate
   that the ZIF-8 framework is not completely stable dimensionally, what
   influences the separation process by allowing gases with higher kinetic
   diameter than its nominal aperture to be sorbed and to diffuse through
   the crystal. Sorption and diffusion selectivities indicate that the
   higher separation performance of the mixed matrix membranes is governed
   by the diffusion process associated with the influence of gas molecule's
   geometry.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to modeling transition information between
   signs in continuous Sign Language Recognition (SLR) and address some
   scalability issues in designing SLR systems. In contrast to Automatic
   Speech Recognition (ASR) in which the transition between speech sounds
   is often brief and mainly addressed by the coarticulation effect, the
   sign transition in continuous SLR is far from being clear and usually
   not easily and exactly characterized. Leveraging upon hidden Markov
   modeling techniques from ASR, we proposed a modeling framework for
   continuous SLR having the following major advantages, namely: (i) the
   system is easy to scale up to large-vocabulary SLR; (ii) modeling of
   signs as well as the transitions between signs is robust even for noisy
   data collected in real-world SLR; and (iii) extensions to training,
   decoding, and adaptation are directly applicable even with new deep
   learning algorithms. A pair of low-cost digital gloves affordable for
   the deaf and hard of hearing community is used to collect a collection
   of training and testing data for real-world SLR interaction
   applications. Evaluated on 1,024 testing sentences from five signers, a
   word accuracy rate of 87.4\% is achieved using a vocabulary of 510
   words. The SLR speed is in real time, requiring an average of 0.69s per
   sentence. The encouraging results indicate that it is feasible to
   develop real-world SLR applications based on the proposed SLR framework.}},

Abstract = {{Finding approximately conserved sequences, called motifs, across
   multiple DNA or protein sequences is an important problem in
   computational biology. In this paper, we consider the (l, d) motif
   search problem of identifying one or more motifs of length l present in
   at least q of the n given sequences, with each occurrence differing from
   the motif in at most d substitutions. The problem is known to be
   NP-complete, and the largest solved instance reported to date is (26,
   11). We propose a novel algorithm for the (l, d) motif search problem
   using streaming execution over a large set of non-deterministic finite
   automata (NFA). This solution is designed to take advantage of the
   micron automata processor, a new technology close to deployment that can
   simultaneously execute multiple NFA in parallel. We demonstrate the
   capability for solving much larger instances of the (l, d) motif search
   problem using the resources available within a single automata processor
   board, by estimating run-times for problem instances (39, 18) and (40,
   17). The paper serves as a useful guide to solving problems using this
   new accelerator technology.}},

Abstract = {{The key intended learning outcome of interdisciplinary engineering
   courses and programs is the development of students' ability to
   integrate knowledge known as integrated understanding. Still, there are
   only few examples of assessment tasks designed to deliberately assess
   this attribute in engineering education, and little is known about how
   to develop credible scoring rubrics that can assess integrated
   understanding promoted by specific interdisciplinary courses. In this
   paper we offer an operational definition of integrated understanding
   developed based on the literature. We also present a method for
   designing credible scoring rubrics for course-specific integrated
   understanding based on this definition. Our process establishes the
   rubric's validity through aligning course learning objectives with the
   rubric criteria and reliability through involving course teachers who
   often come from different disciplinary backgrounds in developing
   performance-level descriptions. We tested the method by applying it to
   design a rubric for evaluating integrated understanding in an
   interdisciplinary undergraduate elective course in Biologically-Inspired
   Design. The resulted rubric was used to grade students' reports (n = 27)
   by the course teachers who came from disciplines as varied as Biology
   and Engineering. Reliability calculated through Intra-Class Correlation
   (ICC) was good to excellent with regard to all criteria. The rubric can
   thus be reliably used by the course teachers to draw valid conclusions
   regarding progression in students' integrative understanding in their
   course. Additionally, this method can be used to establish credible
   scoring rubrics for evaluating students' integrated understanding
   following participation in other interdisciplinary engineering courses.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative learning pedagogies are increasingly used in the west towards
   equipping graduating engineers with the set of skills and competencies
   essential for the engineer of the 21st century. The successful

   educational reform and the building of sustainable knowledge-based
   economies. In this paper, we report on the development of an exportable
   model for effective Problem-Driven Learning (PDL), a problem-based
   learning pedagogy, transfer across cultures. The system is demonstrated
   using a case study in transnational exchange and cooperation between
   Georgia Tech (GT) in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and Khalifa University (KU)
   in Abu Dhabi, UAE around the design of a biomedical engineering course
   delivered using PDL. Although the underlying framework of the innovative
   pedagogy was adopted from GT, various local elements were implemented to
   ensure cultural compatibility. The main hypothesis postulates that
   cultural consideration is critical to the successful globalization of a
   learning pedagogy. Cultural relevance and sensitivity are critical to
   effective cross-cultural transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate matter (PM) or soot sensing technologies are needed for
   feedback and control of exhaust after-treatment systems to meet
   increasingly stringent environmental regulations. A novel low-cost
   electrostatic PM sensing approach has recently been developed based on a
   concentric electrode design with a central cylindrical high-voltage
   electrode surrounded by an inner baffle that serves as the
   ground/negative terminal. The sensing principle is not completely
   understood, but seems to rely on capturing naturally combustion charged
   particles on electrode surfaces where a delay in sensor startup time
   occurs during initial testing. We examined the influence of dendritic
   Ni-Co coatings on PM sensor performance and demonstrated an improvement
   in startup time for an optimized coating morphology when compared with
   bare non-coated control electrodes. The influence of the dendritic Ni-Co
   coating could be related to altering the interaction of PM with specific
   morphological surface features of the dendritic Ni-Co coating on the
   high-voltage electrode. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.}},

Abstract = {{Second harmonic generation (SHG) nanocrystals have recently been
   reported to label cancer cells and other functional cell lines due to
   their unique double-frequency property. In this paper, we report for the
   first time the use of lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) nanocrystals as SHG
   labels for imaging stem cells. Rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were
   labeled with LN nanocrystals in order to study the cellular
   internalization of the nanocrystals and the influence on stem cell
   differentiation. The results showed that LN nanocrystals were
   endocytosed by the rMSCs and the distribution of the internalized
   nanoparticles demonstrated a high consistency with the orientation of
   the actin filaments. Besides, LN-labeled rMSCs showed a
   concentration-dependent viability. Most importantly, rMSCs labeled with
   50 mu g per mL of LN nanocrystals retained their ability to
   differentiate into both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. The results
   prove that LN nanocrystals can be used as a cytocompatible,
   near-infrared (NIR) light driven cell label for long-term imaging,
   without hindering stem cell differentiation. This work will promote the
   use of LN nanocrystals to broader applications like deep-tissue

Abstract = {{This paper describes an investigation into the effects of fluid
   properties on piston pump flow losses through experimentation and
   modeling. The case drain and pressure compensator control flow rates of
   a variable-displacement axial piston pump were measured under a wide
   range of conditions. Synthetic ester, high bulk modulus, VI-improved and
   single grade mineral oils were evaluated. The high bulk modulus fluid
   exhibited 20\% lower flow losses than a conventional mineral oil of the
   same viscosity grade. The modeling effort extended the flow loss
   analysis of Jeong to account for compensator control of the pump
   displacement. Comparisons between model predictions and measured flow
   losses showed good agreement. Stepwise regression analysis of the model
   parameters disclosed that the compressible flow term had a greater
   coefficient of determination than the turbulent or laminar flow terms.
   These findings demonstrate the potential of combining comprehensive
   fluid analysis with modeling to optimize fluids for the efficient
   transmission of power.}},

Title = {{Shear-induced changes in smooth geomembrane surface topography at

Pages = {{113-128}},
Abstract = {{The shear strength of particulate material-smooth geomembrane interfaces
   results predominantly from ploughing and/or sliding of the particles at
   the interface. The relative contribution of particle sliding and
   ploughing for a given smooth geomembrane surface is principally a
   function of relative material hardness, particle angularity, and normal
   stress. The relative material hardness is ambient temperature dependent
   since the geomembrane is polymer based. When ploughing occurs at any
   temperature, the geomembrane surface wears, resulting in altered surface
   topography and different interface strength. This paper summarises the
   results of a study that quantified changes in the surface roughness of
   geomembranes as a function of ambient temperature, normal stress, and
   particle angularity. Surface roughness measurements were made on both
   virgin and post-shear smooth geomembrane specimens using a stylus
   profilometer to quantify the extent of wear resulting from shearing
   against different counterface materials at different temperatures under
   different normal stresses. Increased ambient temperature and particle
   angularity significantly increased the geomembrane surface roughness and
   provided quantitative insight into the wear mechanisms at granular
   material-smooth geomembrane interfaces.}},

Title = {{Elucidating the Hemodynamic Origin of Ballistocardiographic Forces:
   Toward Improved Monitoring of Cardiovascular Health at Home}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE-JTEHM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The ballistocardiogram (BCG), a signal describing the reaction forces of
   the body to cardiac ejection of blood, has recently gained interest in
   the research community as a potential tool for monitoring the mechanical
   aspects of cardiovascular health for patients at home and during normal
   activities of daily living. An important limitation in the field of BCG
   research is that while the BCG signal measures the forces of the body,
   the information desired (and understood) by clinicians and caregivers,
   regarding mechanical health of the cardiovascular system, is typically
   expressed as blood pressure or flow. This paper aims to explore, using
   system identification tools, the mathematical relationship between the
   BCG signal and the better-understood impedance cardiography (ICG) and
   arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms, with a series of human subject
   studies designed to asynchronously modulate cardiac output and blood
   pressure and with different magnitudes. With this approach, we
   demonstrate for 19 healthy subjects that the BCG waveform more closely
   maps to the ICG (flow) waveform as compared with the finger-cuff-based
   ABP (pressure) waveform, and that the BCG can provide a more accurate
   estimate of stroke volume (r = 0.73, p < 0.05) as compared with pulse
   pressure changes (r = 0.26). We also examined, as a feasibility study,
   for one subject, the ability to calibrate the BCG measurement tool with
   an ICG measurement on the first day, and then track changes in stroke
   volume on subsequent days. Accordingly, we conclude that the BCG is a
   signal more closely related to blood flow than pressures, and that a key
   health parameter for titrating care-stroke volume-can potentially be
   accurately measured with BCG signals at home using unobtrusive and
   inexpensive hardware, such as a modified weighing scale, as compared
   with the state-of-the-art ICG and ABP devices, which are expensive and
   obtrusive for use at home.}},

   fracture energy, G(f), as well as the specimen-dependent total fracture
   energy, G(F). The DCT-based fracture properties have the same
   experimental variation as the single-edge notched beam test. The
   experimentally derived fracture parameters were implemented into a
   cohesive zone model, which enabled estimation of concrete tensile
   strength from field-extracted cores.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new algorithm for solving a class of composite
   convex-concave saddle-point problems. The new algorithm is a special
   instance of the hybrid proximal extragradient framework in which a
   Nesterov accelerated variant is used to approximately solve the prox
   subproblems. One of the advantages of the new method is that it works
   for any constant choice of proximal stepsize. Moreover, a suitable
   choice of the latter stepsize yields a method with the best known
   (accelerated inner) iteration complexity for the aforementioned class of
   saddle-point problems. In contrast to the smoothing technique of {[}Y.
   Nesterov, Math. Program., 103 (2005), pp. 127-152], our accelerated
   method does not assume that a feasible set is bounded due to its
   proximal point nature. Experiment results on three problem sets show
   that the new method outperforms Nesterov's smoothing technique of {[}Y.

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2611-2629}},
Abstract = {{Along with minimizing parameter uncertainty, understanding the cause of
   temporal and spatial variability of the nucleated ice crystal number,
   Ni, is key to improving the representation of cirrus clouds in climate
   models. To this end, sensitivities of Ni to input variables like aerosol
   number and diameter provide valuable information about nucleation regime
   and efficiency for a given model formulation. Here we use the adjoint
   model of the adjoint of a cirrus formation parameterization (Barahona
   and Nenes, 2009b) to understand Ni variability for various
   ice-nucleating particle (INP) spectra. Inputs are generated with the
   Community Atmosphere Model version 5, and simulations are done with a
   theoretically derived spectrum, an empirical lab-based spectrum and two
   field-based empirical spectra that differ in the nucleation threshold
   for black carbon particles and in the active site density for dust. The
   magnitude and sign of Ni sensitivity to insoluble aerosol number can be
   directly linked to nucleation regime and efficiency of various INP. The
   lab-based spectrum calculates much higher INP efficiencies than
   field-based ones, which reveals a disparity in aerosol surface
   properties. Ni sensitivity to temperature tends to be low, due to the
   compensating effects of temperature on INP spectrum parameters; this low
   temperature sensitivity regime has been experimentally reported before
   but never deconstructed as done here.}},

Abstract = {{The content of this work focused on calculating tritium production in
   the active core region as well as the surrounding components of the Very
   High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) using detailed Monte Carlo (MC)
   simulations. This is one of VHTR operational issues that need to be
   addressed. Permeation models of tritium in the VHTR plant have high
   levels of uncertainty associated with the initial tritium source from
   different pathways. In the past, the sources were generally derived from
   simple neutronics calculations in one dimension and one group. While
   providing a good estimate for integral pathways such as ternary fission,
   quantifying system-wide production via impurities in surrounding
   components may be largely inaccurate. To reduce this inaccuracy, the
   MAVRIC sequence of the SCALE 6.1 code package was used to calculate
   tritium production rates using a highly detailed Monte-Carlo model for
   neutron transport simulations covering the whole volume inside the
   reactor pressure vessel. It was found that assumptions about impurity
   concentrations in the graphite reflector and helium coolant could lead
   to larger tritium production rates than previously assumed from more
   simplified neutronics models. Previous studies showed that tritium
   permeation to secondary systems already exceeded EPA standards. Using a
   more detailed neutronics/shielding model in this study, even higher
   production rates were calculated than before. Based on these results,
   more work needs to be done to reduce leakage to secondary systems by
   improving helium purification systems and reducing impurities in
   structural components. Sophisticated transport theory simulations are
   necessary to support such analyses. The knowledge obtained in this study
   will also be used in tritium production studies related to liquid salt
   cooled reactors (LSCRs). Finally, it will inform design and selection of
   appropriate dosimetry needed to validate simulations.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major limiting factors to nuclear reactors lifetime is the
   radiation-induced material damage in the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV).
   While older reactors were designed assuming a 40-year operating
   lifetime, new reactor designs are expected to have lifetimes up to 100
   years. For safe operation, the integrity of the RPV must be ensured
   against significant material property changes. In this work, typical
   neutron damage indicators are calculated in the RPV of the (IS)-S-2-LWR
   (Integral Inherently Safe LWR) Power Plant, including DPA (displacements
   per atom) and fast neutron fluence (>1MeV and >0.1MeV). (IS)-S-2-LWR is
   a PWR of integral design, which means that its wider downcomer provides
   additional shielding to the vessel. However, its higher core power
   density and longer lifetime may offset this advantage. In order to
   accurately represent the neutron environment for RPV damage assessment,
   a detailed model based on the preliminary design specifications of the
   (IS)-S-2-LWR was developed to be used in the MAVRIC (Monaco with
   Automated Variance Reduction using Importance Calculations) sequence of
   the Scale6.1 code package. MAVRIC uses the CADIS (Consistent
   Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling) methodology to bias a fixed-source
   MC (Monte Carlo) simulation. To establish the upper limit of a bounding
   envelope, a flat-source distribution was used. For the low limit, a
   center-peaked source was generated using the KENO-VI criticality
   sequence assuming uniform fresh fuel core. Results based on the
   preliminary (IS)-S-2-LWR model show that DPA rates and fast fluence
   rates are conservatively 75\% lower than in typical PWRs being operated
   currently in the US.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional trim optimization problem formulations can produce poor
   results for vehicles with redundant multi-axis control surfaces.
   Trimming these vehicles requires solving the nonlinear equations of
   motion for their roots or equilibrium points. The hybrid wing-body
   vehicle has many redundant elevons and tends to result in an
   underdetermined system. As a consequence, there may be an infinite
   number of deflection combinations that satisfy the same moments.
   Challenges associated with using conventional trim optimizations with
   this type of vehicle are demonstrated, followed by two alternative
   approaches to relieve these problems. Control allocation techniques are
   integrated into the conventional approach to reduce the number of
   variables and attempt to make the problem more convex. A reformulation
   of the trim optimization from root seeking to drag minimization was also
   explored. These alternative methods were judged on how often they
   converged, trimmed drag and thrust, and commanded deflections.}},

Abstract = {{Managing a risk to a built environment from natural and man-made hazards
   is an important issue for the prosperity of a nation. Risk assessment
   forms the basis for the risk management, which often involves
   uncertainties that arise from our ignorance about the risk, such as lack
   of data, errors in collected data, and assumptions made in the modeling
   and analysis. This uncertainty that arises from imprecise information is
   referred to as epistemic uncertainty, as opposed to the aleatory
   uncertainty that arises from the variability of possible outcomes. If
   epistemic uncertainty prevails, assessing and managing a risk rely on
   risk perception of a decision maker. Studies have suggested that the
   risk of low-probability high-consequence events tends to be
   overestimated by the public. Thus, the role of risk perception in risk
   management of civil infrastructure exposed to natural and man-made
   hazards becomes significant because of the potential catastrophic
   consequences of such risks (e.g. casualties, functional and economic
   losses of the built environment, etc.) to the public. The consideration
   of epistemic uncertainty and risk perception in risk assessment of a
   built environment may lead to a risk management solution that is
   different from what is obtained when it is not incorporated. In this
   study, we present a risk-informed decision-making framework that can
   assist decision makers, including governmental agencies that allocate
   limited resources to enhance the safety and security of the civil
   infrastructure. In this framework, epistemic uncertainty is incorporated
   by utilizing generalized interval probability theory and cumulative
   prospect theory. The framework is illustrated with an example of
   regional hurricane risk management for residential buildings located in
   Miami-Dade County, Florida, considering the effect of changing climate.}},

Title = {{Cyclic behaviors of amorphous shape memory polymers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3234-3245}},
Abstract = {{Cyclic loading conditions are commonly encountered in the applications
   of shape memory polymers (SMPs), where the cyclic characteristics of the
   materials determine their performance during the service life, such as
   deformation resistance, shape recovery speed and shape recovery ratio.
   Recent studies indicate that in addition to the physical damage or some
   other irreversible softening effects, the viscoelastic nature could also
   be another possible reason for the degraded cyclic behavior of SMPs. In
   this paper, we explore in detail the influence of the viscoelastic
   properties on the cyclic tension and shape memory (SM) behavior of an
   epoxy based amorphous thermosetting polymer. Cyclic experiments were
   conducted first, which show that although the epoxy material does not
   have any visible damage or irreversible softening effect during
   deformation, it still exhibits obvious degradation in the cyclic tension
   and SM behaviors. A linear multi-branched model is utilized to assist in
   the prediction and understanding of the mechanical responses of
   amorphous SMPs. Parametric studies based on the applied model suggest
   that the shape memory performance can be improved by adjusting
   programming and recovery conditions, such as lowering the loading rate,
   increasing the programming temperature, and reducing the holding time.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly
   efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the
   complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology
   optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies.
   Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between
   topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has
   minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is
   currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger
   build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground
   structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results
   obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of
   post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is
   described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be
   generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization
   technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In
   addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose
   methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework

Abstract = {{This article aims to identify occupations at risk of climate change, and
   explore their spatial distribution by investigating their spatial
   concentration and cluster patterns in Korea. In order to identify
   professions vulnerable to climate change, we used three criteria: (1)
   exposure to the risks of job activities; (2) sensitivity to work
   environments; and (3) adaptive capacities based on the socioeconomic
   conditions of a person's occupation. We identified 26 vocations as
   vulnerable, which corresponds to 16.5\% of the total number of careers.
   Then, we used exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) techniques to
   examine the spatial distribution of jobs at risk of climate change
   effects. Endangered occupations show the extremely uneven spatial
   distributions across regions, indicating that there is a wide range of
   values for the proportion of endangered occupations across regions. The
   regions with high proportions of professions in jeopardy show clear
   spatial clustering based on the large geographic belt from the southwest
   to the northeast. Our results suggest that policymakers should consider
   the specific geographies of vulnerable occupations. The current work
   provides helpful hints on regional policy coordination to promote a
   virtuous circle of sustainable regional development.}},

Abstract = {{In non-destructive evaluation of composites, an efficient method for
   mapping damage is critical for assessing the severity of damage in a
   specimen. Phase congruency (PC) is a technique for detecting edges in
   images. This paper adapts this technique to map damage in composite
   plates. The method utilizes two-dimensional wavefield measurements of a
   guided wave propagating through the specimen. Each time step of the
   two-dimensional wavefield is analyzed with the modified PC measure. The
   results of each time step are aggregated yielding a full field map of
   the specimen identifying the damage. The approach was validated on
   numerical and experimental data sets for simulated damage in a plate. In
   concept, the PC measure exploits the fact that the phase of the spatial
   Fourier components of a signal have an equal value at a discontinuity.
   To do this, the measure compares the magnitude of the sum of the
   components to the sum of the magnitude of the components. The upper
   bound of this ratio is unity. PC values approaching unity indicate the
   phases of each the components are aligned and identify a discontinuity.
   This measure was adapted for the present case; a strong interrogating
   wave dominates the wavenumber spectrum obscuring low amplitude
   wavenumber information related to discontinuities. The resulting
   technique provides a map of damage in a two-dimensional space without
   necessitating the use of a model or baseline measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wavefield imaging is an effective means of measuring and
   visualizing angle-beam bulk waves propagating in plate-like structures.
   In angle-beam testing, hulk waves are incident into a plate at an
   oblique angle via an angled wedge, and reflect between the surfaces of
   the plate as they propagate through the medium. Here, a laser Doppler
   vibrometer system is used to image the resulting wavefield on the
   surface of the plate in a 2D rectilinear grid. Through holes are of
   particular interest because cracks frequently originate at fastener
   holes in many engineering structures. Boundary conditions inside
   fastener holes can vary significantly during the life of a structure and
   thus may affect the results of ultrasonic nondestructive testing
   methods. In this research, the scattering of bulk waves incident on a
   through hole is measured for a variety of fill conditions, including
   complete and partial filling with steel inserts coupled with epoxy or
   oil. Analysis techniques are described to quantify scattering as a
   function of angle for different boundary conditions. Experimental
   results are presented that demonstrate the utility of these techniques
   for quantifying angle-beam bulk wave scattering from through-holes.}},

Abstract = {{Although bulk waves have served as the industry standard in
   nondestructive evaluation for many years, guided waves (Lamb waves in
   plates) have become the focus of many current research efforts because
   they are able to interrogate larger areas of a structure in less time.
   Despite this advantage, guided waves also have characteristics that
   obfuscate data interpretation. The first property of guided waves that
   complicates analysis is their dispersive nature: their wave speed is a
   function of frequency. The second is that they are multimodal: they
   propagate as multiple symmetric and antisymmetric modes. Using
   pulse-compression techniques and a priori calculations of theoretical
   dispersion curves, the dispersive matched filter attempts to take
   advantage of these otherwise undesirable characteristics by maximizing
   the autocorrelation for only one mode, ideally increasing both the
   signal-to-noise ratio and time-resolution of ultrasonic guided wave
   measurements. In this research, the responses from broadband chirp
   excitations are recorded from a sparse transducer array after
   propagation through an aluminum plate containing no damage and simulated
   damage. Dispersive matched filtering is applied to the measurements and
   localization images are generated using the delay-and-sum method.
   Imaging results are compared to those obtained with narrowband tone
   burst excitations in terms of their ability to detect and localize the
   different scatterers. Results show that the dispersive matched filter
   notably improves the quality of the localization images.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave measurements are at the basis of several Non-Destructive
   Evaluation (NDE) techniques. Although sparse measurements of guided wave
   obtained using piezoelectric sensors can efficiently detect and locate
   defects, extensive informa-tion on the shape and subsurface location of
   defects can be extracted from full-field measurements acquired by Laser
   Doppler Vibrometers (LDV). Wavefield acquisition from LDVs is generally
   a slow operation due to the fact that the wave propagation to record
   must be repeated for each point measurement and the initial conditions
   must be reached between each measurement. In this research, a Sparse
   Wavefield Reconstruction (SWR) process using Compressed Sensing is
   developed. The goal of this technique is to reduce the number of point
   measurements needed to apply NDE techniques by at least one order of
   magnitude by extrapolating the knowledge of a few randomly chosen
   measured pixels over an over-sampled grid. To achieve this, the Lamb
   wave propagation equation is used to formulate a basis of shape
   functions in which the wavefield has a sparse representation, in order
   to comply with the Compressed Sensing requirements and use
   l1-minimization solvers. The main assumption of this reconstruction
   process is that every material point of the studied area is a potential
   source. The Compressed Sensing matrix is defined as being the
   contribution that would have been received at a measurement location
   from each possible source, using the dispersion relations of the
   specimen computed using a Semi-Analytical Finite Element technique. The
   measurements are then processed through an l1-minimizer to find a
   minimum corresponding to the set of active sources and their
   corresponding excitation functions. This minimum represents the best
   combination of the parameters of the model matching the sparse
   measurements. Wavefields are then reconstructed using the propagation
   equation. The set of active sources found by minimization contains all
   the wave excitation sources (such as PZT transducers) and scatters, and
   can therefore be used as an NDE technique. Results are shown for an
   analytical wavefield as well as for experimental wavefields in an
   anisotropic specimen with delamination.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the modeling of randomly distributed
   surface-breaking microcracks and the dependency of higher harmonic
   generation in Rayleigh surface waves on microcrack density. The
   microcrack model is based on micromechanical considerations of rough
   surface contact. An effective stress-strain relationship is derived to
   describe the nonlinear behavior of a single microcrack and implemented
   into a finite-element model via a hyperelastic constitutive law.
   Finite-element simulations of nonlinear wave propagation in a solid with
   distributed surface microcracks are performed for a range of microcrack
   densities. The evolution of fundamental and second harmonic amplitudes
   along the propagation distance is studied and the acoustic nonlinearity
   parameter is calculated. The results show that the nonlinearity
   parameter increases with crack density. While, for small crack densities
   (dilute concentration of microcracks) a proportionality between crack
   density and acoustic nonlinearity is observed, this is not valid for
   higher crack densities, as the microcracks start to interact.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a 3D numerical finite element (FE) model which,
   previously developed, precisely simulates non-contact, air-coupled
   measurements of nonlinear Rayleigh wave propagation. The commercial
   FE-solver ABAQUS is used to perform the simulations. First, frequency
   dependent pressure wave attenuation is investigated numerically to
   reconstruct the sound pressure distribution along the active surface of
   the non-contact receiver. Second, constitutive law and excitation source
   properties are optimized to match nonlinear ultrasonic experimental
   data. Finally, the FE-model data are fit with analytical solutions
   showing a good agreement and thus, indicating the significance of the

Abstract = {{The behavior of guided waves propagating in anisotropic composite panels
   can be substantially more complicated than for isotropic, metallic
   plates. The angular dependency of wave propagation characteristics need
   to be understood and quantified before applying methods for damage
   detection and characterization. This study experimentally investigates
   the anisotropy of wave speed and attenuation for the fundamental An-like
   guided wave mode propagating in a solid laminate composite panel. A
   piezoelectric transducer is the wave source and a laser Doppler
   vibrometer is used to measure the outward propagating waves along radial
   lines originating at the source transducer. Group velocity, phase
   velocity and attenuation are characterized as a function of angle for a
   single center frequency. The methods shown in this paper serve as a
   framework for future adaptation to damage imaging methods using guided
   waves for structural health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{As a longitudinal wave propagates through a linearly elastic solid with
   distributed cracks, the solid is subjected to cyclic tension and
   compression. During the tensile cycles, a crack might be open and its
   faces are traction-free. During the compressive cycles, a crack might be
   closed and its faces are in contact. Such contact may also be frictional
   because of crack face roughness. Such tension and compression asymmetry
   causes acoustic nonlinearity. This paper develops a micromechanics model
   that relates the crack density to the acoustic nonlinearity parameter.
   The model is based on a micromechanics homogenization of the cracked
   solid under dynamic loading. It is shown that the acoustic nonlinearity
   parameter is proportional to the crack density. Furthermore, the
   acoustic nonlinearity parameter also depends on the frequency of the
   wave motion, and the coefficient of friction of the crack faces. Unlike
   the second harmonic generated by dislocations, the amplitude of the
   second harmonic due to crack face contact is proportional to the
   amplitude of the fundamental frequency. To validate the micromechanics
   model, the finite element method is used to simulate wave propagation in
   solid with randomly distributed microcracks. The micromechanics model
   predictions agree well with the finite element simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction pathways for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas are studied
   over K/MoS2 domains supported on mesoporous carbon (C) and mixed MgAl
   oxide (MMO) via addition of methanol, ethanol, and ethylene co-feeds. A
   methanol co-feed results in an increase in ethanol and methane
   production for the catalysts studied. Ethanol or ethylene co-feeds yield
   increased C3+OH and C2+HC over the supported catalysts. No change is
   observed in the product distribution over K/bulk-MoS2 with an ethanol
   co-feed, but 1-propanol production significantly increases in the
   presence of ethylene, suggesting the formation of ethyl species from
   ethanol and/or the adsorption of ethanol are rate-controlling for
   1-propanol formation when ethanol is co-fed. Ethylene and ethanol
   co-feeds yield similar production rates of C3+OH over the MMO catalyst,
   indicating that alcohol formation likely proceeds primarily via the same
   acyl intermediate as olefin carbonylation. Supports do seem to have an
   important influence on the reaction pathways. Specifically, acidic
   carbon support seems to facilitate alcohol dehydration/hydrogenation to
   produce alkanes, while MMO influences methanol plus 1-propanol coupling
   to form isobutyl alcohol. However, Mo-K-MMO sites are key for superior
   normalized C3+OH productivity with ethanol and ethylene co-feeds over
   the MMO catalyst.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3728-3734}},
Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been invented as a new
   technology for harvesting mechanical energy, with enormous advantages.
   One of the major themes in their development is the improvement of the
   power output, which is fundamentally determined by the triboelectric
   charge density. Besides the demonstrated physical surface engineering
   methods to enhance this density, chemical surface functionalization to
   modify the surface potential could be a more effective and direct
   approach. In this paper, we introduced the method of using
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to functionalize surfaces for the
   enhancement of TENGs' output. By using thiol molecules with different
   head groups to functionalize Au surfaces, the influence of head groups
   on both the surface potential and the triboelectric charge density was
   systematically studied, which reveals their direct correlation. With
   amine as the head group, the TENG's output power is enhanced by similar
   to 4 times. By using silane-SAMs with an amine head group to modify the
   silica surface, this approach is also demonstrated for insulating
   triboelectric layers in TENGs. This research provides an important route
   for the future research on improving TENGs' output through materials
   optimization.}},

   pollen-stigma interaction}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2965-2975}},
Abstract = {{Many soft biomimetic synthetic adhesives, optimized to support
   macroscopic masses (similar to kg), have been inspired by geckos,
   insects and other animals. Far less work has investigated bioinspired
   adhesion that is tuned to micro- and nano-scale sizes and forces.
   However, such adhesive forces are extremely important in the adhesion of
   micro-and nanoparticles to surfaces, relevant to a wide range of
   industrial and biological systems. Pollens, whose adhesion is critical
   to plant reproduction, are an evolutionary-optimized system for
   biomimicry to engineer tunable adhesion between particles and
   micro-patterned soft matter surfaces. In addition, the adhesion of
   pollen particles is relevant to topics as varied as pollinator ecology,
   transport of allergens, and atmospheric phenomena. We report the first
   observation of structurally-derived pressure-sensitive adhesion of a
   microparticle by using the sunflower pollen and stigma surfaces as a
   model. This strong, pressure-sensitive adhesion results from
   interlocking between the pollen's conical spines and the stigma's
   receptive papillae. Inspired by this behavior, we fabricated synthetic
   polymeric patterned surfaces that mimic the stigma surface's receptivity
   to pollen. These soft mimics allow the magnitude of the
   pressure-sensitive response to be tuned by adjusting the size and
   spacing of surface features. These results provide an important new
   insight for soft material adhesion based on bio-inspired principles,
   namely that ornamented microparticles and micro-patterned surfaces can
   be designed with complementarity that enable a tunable,
   pressure-sensitive adhesion on the microparticle size and length scale.}},

Abstract = {{Covalent adaptable network (or dynamic covalent network) polymers can
   alternate their network topology through bond exchange reactions,
   whereby an active atom replaces an atom in an existing bond, resulting
   in a new bond and a new active atom. This process repeats itself
   numerous times in the network, bestowing interesting material behaviors,
   such as stress relaxation, surface welding, self-healing and recycling,
   upon the network. In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations are used
   to investigate surface welding due to bond exchange reactions in an
   epoxy system. Two epoxy networks are constructed and brought into
   contact, and bond exchange reactions are then activated. The trajectory
   of active atoms is tracked, which shows how the active atoms cross the
   interface. Based on simulation results, this work analyzes the influence
   of welding conditions, such as welding time, welding temperature, degree
   of polymerization and crosslinking density of original networks, on the
   mechanical properties of welded materials. These parameters determine
   the number of connected bonds on the interface, which consequently
   affects the welding performance. Eventually, with a sufficiently long
   welding time, the system can fully recover the same modulus and yielding
   stress as those of a fresh network. Finally, the active atoms'
   penetration depth, obtained from MD simulation, shows good agreement
   with the predictions of some existing theories.}},

Title = {{Wintertime aerosol chemical composition, volatility, and spatial
   variability in the greater London area}},

Abstract = {{The composition of PM1 (particulate matter with diameter less than 1 mu
   m) in the greater London area was characterized during the Clean Air for
   London (ClearfLo) project in winter 2012. Two high-resolution
   time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometers (HR-ToF-AMS) were deployed at
   a rural site (Detling,Kent) and an urban site (North Kensington,
   London). The simultaneous and high-temporal resolution measurements at
   the two sites provide a unique opportunity to investigate the spatial
   distribution of PM1. We find that the organic aerosol (OA) concentration
   is comparable between the rural and urban sites, but the contribution
   from different sources is distinctly different between the two sites.
   The concentration of solid fuel OA at the urban site is about twice as
   high as at the rural site, due to elevated domestic heating in the urban
   area. While the concentrations of oxygenated OA (OOA) are
   well-correlated between the two sites, the OOA concentration at the
   rural site is almost twice that of the urban site. At the rural site,
   more than 70\% of the carbon in OOA is estimated to be non-fossil, which
   suggests that OOA is likely related to aged biomass burning considering
   the small amount of biogenic SOA in winter. Thus, it is possible that
   the biomass burning OA contributes a larger fraction of ambient OA in
   wintertime than what previous field studies have suggested.
   A suite of instruments was deployed downstream of a thermal denuder (TD)
   to investigate the volatility of PM1 species at the rural Detling site.
   After heating at 250 degrees C in the TD, 40\% of the residual mass is
   OA, indicating the presence of non-volatile organics in the aerosol.
   Although the OA associated with refractory black carbon (rBC; measured
   by a soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer) only accounts for < 10\%
   of the total OA (measured by a HR-ToF-AMS) at 250 degrees C, the two
   measurements are well-correlated, suggesting that the non-volatile
   organics have similar sources or have undergone similar chemical
   processing as rBC in the atmosphere. Although the atomic O: C ratio of
   OOA is substantially larger than that of solid fuel OA and
   hydrocarbon-like OA, these three factors have similar volatility, which
   is inferred from the change in mass concentration after heating at 120
   degrees C. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the mass
   fraction remaining (MFR) of OA after heating in the TD and atomic O: C
   of OA and find that particles with a wide range of O: C could have
   similar MFR after heating. This analysis emphasizes the importance of
   understanding the distribution of volatility and O: C in bulk OA.}},

Title = {{Synergistic enzymatic and microbial lignin conversion}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1306-1312}},
Abstract = {{The utilization of lignin for fungible fuels and chemicals represents
   one of the most imminent challenges in modern biorefineries. However,
   bioconversion of lignin is highly challenging due to its recalcitrant
   nature as a phenolic heteropolymer. This study addressed the challenges
   by revealing the chemical and biological mechanisms for synergistic
   lignin degradation by a bacterial and enzymatic system, which
   significantly improved lignin consumption, cell growth and lipid yield.
   The Rhodococcus opacus cell growth increased exponentially in response
   to the level of laccase treatment, indicating the synergy between
   laccase and bacterial cells in lignin degradation. Other treatments like
   iron and hydrogen peroxide showed limited impact on cell growth.
   Chemical analysis of lignin under various treatments further confirmed
   the synergy between laccase and cells at the chemical level. P-31
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggested that laccase, R. opacus cell
   and Fenton reaction reagents promoted the degradation of different types
   of lignin functional groups, elucidating the chemical basis for the
   synergistic effects. 31P NMR further revealed that laccase treatment had
   the most significant impact for degrading the abundant chemical groups.
   The results were further confirmed by the molecular weight analysis and
   lignin quantification by the Prussian blue assay. The cell-laccase
   fermentation led to a 17-fold increase of lipid production. Overall, the
   study indicated that laccase and R. opacus can synergize to degrade
   lignin efficiently, likely through rapid utilization of monomers
   generated by laccase to promote the reaction toward depolymerization.
   The study provided a potential path for more efficient lignin conversion
   and development of consolidated lignin conversion.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive Assessment of Coronary Plaque Progression With Advanced
   Intravascular Imaging, Physiological Measures, and Wall Shear Stress: A
   Pilot Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial of Nebivolol
   Versus Atenolol in Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background-We hypothesized that nebivolol, a b-blocker with nitric
   oxide-mediated activity, compared with atenolol, a b-blocker without
   such activity, would decrease oxidative stress and improve the effects
   of endothelial dysfunction and wall shear stress (WSS), thereby reducing
   atherosclerosis progression and vulnerability in patients with
   nonobstructive coronary artery disease.
   Methods and Results-In this pilot double-blinded randomized controlled
   trial, 24 patients treated for 1 year with nebivolol 10 mg versus
   atenolol 100 mg plus standard medical therapy underwent baseline and
   follow-up coronary angiography with assessments of inflammatory and
   oxidative stress biomarkers, microvascular function, endothelial
   function, and virtual histology intravascular ultrasound. WSS was
   calculated from computational fluid dynamics. Virtual histology
   intravascular ultrasound segments were assessed for vessel volumetrics
   and remodeling. There was a trend toward more low-WSS segments in the
   nebivolol cohort (P= 0.06). Low-WSS regions were associated with greater
   plaque progression (P< 0.0001) and constrictive remodeling (P= 0.04);
   conversely, high-WSS segments demonstrated plaque regression and
   excessive expansive remodeling. Nebivolol patients had decreased lumen
   and vessel areas along with increased plaque area, resulting in more
   constrictive remodeling (P= 0.002). There were no significant
   differences in biomarker levels, microvascular function, endothelial
   function, or number of thin-capped fibroatheromas per vessel.
   Importantly, after adjusting for b-blocker, low-WSS segments remained
   significantly associated with lumen loss and plaque progression.
   Conclusion-Nebivolol, compared with atenolol, was associated with
   greater plaque progression and constrictive remodeling, likely driven by
   more low-WSS segments in the nebivolol arm. Both b-blockers had similar
   effects on oxidative stress, microvascular function, and endothelial
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Localization of active neural source (ANS) from measurements on head
   surface is vital in magnetoencephalography. As neuron-generated magnetic
   fields are extremely weak, significant uncertainties caused by
   stochastic measurement interference complicate its localization. This
   paper presents a novel computational method based on reconstructed
   magnetic field from sparse noisy measurements for enhanced ANS
   localization by suppressing effects of unrelated noise. In this
   approach, the magnetic flux density (MFD) in the nearby current-free
   space outside the head is reconstructed from measurements through
   formulating the infinite series solution of the Laplace's equation,
   where boundary condition (BC) integrals over the entire measurements
   provide ``smooth{''} reconstructed MFD with the decrease in unrelated
   noise. Using a gradient-based method, reconstructed MFDs with good
   fidelity are selected for enhanced ANS localization. The reconstruction
   model, spatial interpolation of BC, parametric equivalent current
   dipole-based inverse estimation algorithm using reconstruction, and
   gradient-based selection are detailed and validated. The influences of
   various source depths and measurement signal-to-noise ratio levels on
   the estimated ANS location are analyzed numerically and compared with a
   traditional method (where measurements are directly used), and it was
   demonstrated that gradient-selected high-fidelity reconstructed data can
   effectively improve the accuracy of ANS localization.}},

Abstract = {{Although algae-biofuels have many advantages including high areal
   productivity, algae can be preyed upon by amoebas, protozoans, ciliates,
   and rotifers, particularly in open pond systems. Thus, these higher
   organisms need to be controlled. In this study, Chlorella kessleri was
   used as the algal culture and Brachionus calyciflorus as the source of
   predation. The effect of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) was tested with
   the goal of totally inhibiting the rotifer while causing minor
   inhibition to the alga. The 24-hr LC50 for B. calyciflorus in spring
   water was 0.198 mg Cl/L while the 24-hr LC50 for C. kessleri was 0.321
   mg Cl/L. However, chlorine dissipates rapidly as the algae serves as
   reductant. Results showed a chlorine dosage between 0.45 to 0.6 mg Cl/L
   and a dosing interval of two hours created the necessary chlorine
   concentrations to inhibit predation while letting the algae grow; thus
   giving algae farmers a tool to prevent pond crashes.}},

   the acoustics of small tanks to be able to carry out valid auditory
   research in the laboratory and to properly compare and interpret the

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the capacity for sound source localization is
   common to mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, but surprisingly it
   is not known whether fish locate sound sources in the same manner (e.g.,
   combining binaural and monaural cues) or what computational strategies
   they use for successful source localization. Directional hearing and
   sound source localization in fishes continues to be important topics in
   neuroethology and in the hearing sciences, but the empirical and
   theoretical work on these topics have been contradictory and obscure for
   decades. This chapter reviews the previous behavioral work on
   directional hearing and sound source localization in fishes including
   the most recent experiments on sound source localization by the plainfin
   midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus), which has proven to be an
   exceptional species for fish studies of sound localization. In addition,
   the theoretical models of directional hearing and sound source
   localization for fishes are reviewed including a new model that uses a
   time-averaged intensity approach for source localization that has wide
   applicability with regard to source type, acoustic environment, and time
   waveform.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents two high-gain, multidirector Yagi-Uda antennas for
   use within the 24.5-GHz ISM band, realized through a multilayer, purely
   additive inkjet printing fabrication process on a flexible substrate.
   Multilayer material deposition is used to realize these 3-D antenna
   structures, including a fully printed 120-m-thick dielectric substrate
   for microstrip-to-slotline feeding conversion. The antennas are
   fabricated, measured, and compared to simulated results showing good
   agreement and highlighting the reliable predictability of the printing
   process. An endfire realized gain of 8 dBi is achieved within the
   24.5-GHz ISM band, presenting the highest-gain inkjet-printed antenna at
   this end of the millimeter-wave regime. The results of this work further
   demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing inkjet printing for low-cost,
   vertically integrated antenna structures for on-chip and on-package
   integration throughout the emerging field of high-frequency wireless

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic mRNA has recently shown great potential as a tool for genetic
   introduction of proteins. Its utility as a gene carrier has been
   demonstrated in several studies for both the introduction of therapeutic
   proteins and subunit vaccines. At one point, synthetic mRNA was believed
   to be too immunogenic and labile for pharmaceutical purposes. However,
   the development of several strategies have enabled mRNA technology to
   overcome these challenges, including incorporation of modified
   nucleotides, codon optimization of the coding region, incorporation of
   untranslated regions into the mRNA, and the use of delivery vehicles.
   While these approaches have been shown to enhance performance of some
   mRNA constructs, gene-to-gene variation and low efficiency of mRNA
   protein production are still significant hurdles. Further mechanistic
   understanding of how these strategies affect protein production and
   innate immune activation is needed for the widespread adoption for both
   therapeutic and vaccine applications. This review highlights key studies
   involved in the development of strategies employed to increase protein
   expression and control the immunogenicity of synthetic mRNA. Areas in
   the literature where improved understanding is needed will also be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The strategies of pathogens to evade the human immune system are highly
   sophisticated and modulate a variety of inflammatory pathways. The
   similarities in the demands for modulation of inflammatory responses
   during disease treatment and during pathogenic infection provide
   opportunities to use pathogenic virulence factors to develop a new class
   of therapeutic materials that control inflammation. In this work, we
   harness a strategy from Porphyromonas gingivalis by transforming its
   major virulence factor, an arginine-specific cysteine protease, into
   self-assembled protease-inorganic hybrid supraparticles. The cysteine
   protease degrades the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). It is an irreversible inhibition of TNF-alpha,
   which avoids some of the adverse effects of current TNF-alpha
   antagonists. We fabricated self-assembled porous supraparticles that
   specifically incorporate the pathogen-derived protease and showed
   improved inactivation of TNF-alpha over soluble enzyme, creating a
   potential therapeutic for various autoimmune diseases or other sources
   of inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of facility conductivity on Hall effect thruster cathode
   coupling is experimentally investigated. The 3.4 kW Aerojet Rocketdyne
   T-140 Hall effect thruster operating at a discharge voltage of 300 V, a
   discharge current of 10.3 A, and an anode flow rate of 11.6 mg/s serves
   as a representative Hall effect thruster test bed. The nominal facility
   operating pressure during thruster operation is 7.3 x 10(-6) Torr
   corrected for xenon. Two 0.91 x 0.91 m square aluminum plates are placed
   adjacent to, but electrically isolated from, the walls of the conductive
   vacuum chamber at two locations with respect to the center of the
   thruster exit plane: 4.3 m axially downstream along the thruster
   centerline, and 2.3 m radially outward centered on the exit plane. The
   plates and body of the Hall effect thruster are configured in three
   distinct electrical configurations with corresponding measurements: 1)
   electrically grounded with measurements of currents to ground, 2)
   electrically isolated with measurements of floating voltages, and 3)
   isolated from ground but electrically connected with measurements of the
   current conducted between the plates. Measurements are taken as the
   radial position of the cathode is varied from 0 to 129 cm with respect
   to the nominal cathode location. Measurements of the current collected
   by the plates and thruster body indicate that cathode electrons
   preferentially travel to the thruster body, Hall effect thruster plume,
   and radial facility surfaces for cathode locations in the near field,
   midfield, and far field, respectively. These results indicate that
   cathode position alters the recombination pathways taken by cathode
   electrons in the Hall effect thruster circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Using nanostructure metal oxide decorated interfaces we study the

   presence of xylene. We have evaluated the response of the porous silicon
   (PS) interface and the enhancement of the interface decorated with SnOx,
   NiO, CuxO, and AuxO (x >> 1) nanostructured deposits. SO2, which acts as
   a Lewis acid, appears to be rapidly converted upon interaction to form a
   basic analyte which interacts with the nanostructure decorated PS
   interface. This process can be monitored through the inversion of
   conductometric response. We suggest that SO2 interacts and forms the
   transient ion, SO3-. The process can be inhibited in the presence of
   xylene. The response of an SnOx and AuxO decorated interface to this
   suggested intermediate is found to dominate those of NiO and CuxO. (C)

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Abstract = {{Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising substrate for graphene
   based nano-electronic devices. We investigate the ballistic phonon
   transport at the interface of vertically stacked graphene and h-BN
   heterostructures using first principles density functional theory and
   atomistic Green's function simulations considering the influence of
   lattice stacking. We compute the frequency and wave-vector dependent
   transmission function and observe distinct stacking-dependent phonon
   transmission features for the h-BN/graphene/h-BN sandwiched systems. We
   find that the in-plane acoustic modes have the dominant contributions to
   the phonon transmission and thermal boundary conductance (TBC) for the
   interfaces with the carbon atom located directly on top of the boron
   atom (C-B matched) because of low interfacial spacing. The low
   interfacial spacing is a consequence of the differences in the effective
   atomic volume of N and B and the difference in the local electron
   density around N and B. For the structures with the carbon atom directly
   on top of the nitrogen atom (C-N matched), the spatial distance
   increases and the contribution of in-plane modes to the TBC decreases
   leading to higher contributions by out-of-plane acoustic modes. We find
   that the C-B matched interfaces have stronger phonon-phonon coupling
   than the C-N matched interfaces, which results in significantly higher
   TBC (more than 50\%) in the C-B matched interface. The findings in this
   study will provide insights to understand the mechanism of phonon
   transport at h-BN/graphene/h-BN interfaces, to better explain the
   experimental observations and to engineer these interfaces to enhance
   heat dissipation in graphene based electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with the estimation of alpha = E\{r(Z)\},
   where Z is a random vector and the function values r(z) must be
   evaluated using simulation. Estimation problems of this form arise in
   the field of Bayesian simulation, where Z represents the uncertain
   (input) parameters of a system and r(z) is the expected performance of
   the system when Z = z. Our approach involves obtaining (possibly biased)
   simulation estimates of the function values r(z) for a number of
   different values of z, and then using a (possibly weighted) average of
   these estimates to estimate alpha. We start by considering the case
   where the chosen values of z are independent and identically distributed
   observations of the random vector Z (independent sampling). We analyze
   the resulting estimator as the total computational effort c grows and
   provide numerical results. Then we show that improved convergence rates
   can be obtained through the use of techniques other than independent
   sampling. Specifically, our results indicate that the use of
   quasi-random sequences yields a better convergence rate than independent
   sampling, and that in the presence of a suitable special structure, it
   may be possible to use other numerical integration techniques (such as
   Simpson's rule) to achieve the best possible rate c-1/2 as c ->
   infinity. Finally, we present and analyze a general framework of
   estimators for a that encompasses independent sampling, quasi-random
   sequences, and Simpson's rule as special cases.}},

Title = {{FNM: An Enhanced Null-Message Algorithm for Parallel Simulation of
   Multicore Systems}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As multicore computer systems become increasingly complex, parallel
   simulation is becoming an important tool for exploring design space and
   evaluating design tradeoffs. The key to the success of parallel
   simulation is the ability to maintain a high degree of parallelism under
   synchronization constraints. In this article, an enhanced Null-message
   algorithm called FNM is presented that uses domain-specific knowledge to
   improve the performance of the basic Null-message algorithm. Based on
   their runtime states, the components of the simulation model can make a
   conservative forecast of future interprocess events. The forecast
   information is carried in the enhanced Null-messages, and, by combining
   the forecast from both sides of an interprocess link, FNM can achieve a
   dynamic system lookahead that is much greater than what the static
   system structure provides. This improved lookahead allows better
   exploitation of the simulation model's inherent parallelism and leads to
   better performance. Compared with the basic Null-message algorithm, FNM
   greatly reduces the amount of Null-messages and improves parallel
   simulation performance as a result, while at the same time it guarantees
   simulation correctness as the basic Null-message algorithm does. In
   tests on cycle-level models with up to 128 cores, FNM shows good
   scalability and proves to be an effective method.}},

Abstract = {{On 8 November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan impacted the Philippines with
   estimated winds of approximately 314 km h(-1) and an associated
   5-7-m-high storm surge that struck Tacloban City and the surrounding
   coast of the shallow, funnel-shaped San Pedro Bay. Typhoon Haiyan killed
   more than 6,000 people, superseding Tropical Storm Thelma of November
   1991 as the deadliest typhoon in the Philippines. Globally, it was the
   deadliest tropical cyclone since Nargis hit Myanmar in 2008. Here, we
   use field measurements, eyewitness accounts, and video recordings to
   corroborate numerical simulations and to characterize the extremely high
   velocity flooding caused by the Typhoon Haiyan storm surge in both San
   Pedro Bay and on the more open Pacific Ocean coast. We then compare the
   surge heights from Typhoon Haiyan with historical records of an unnamed
   typhoon that took a similar path of destruction in October 1897 (Ty
   1897) but which was less intense, smaller, and moved more slowly. The
   Haiyan surge was about twice the height of the 1897 event in San Pedro
   Bay, but the two storm surges had similar heights on the open Pacific
   coast. Until stronger prehistoric events are explored, these two storm
   surges serve as worst-case scenarios for this region. This study
   highlights that rare but disastrous events should be carefully evaluated
   in the context of enhancing community-based disaster risk awareness,
   planning, and response.}},

Abstract = {{High-carbon-content fly ashes with biomass particles are typically
   landfilled in accordance with the ASTM C618 regulation. To quantify
   their geotechnical properties relating to storage and disposal, this
   study evaluates the small to intermediate strain properties of fly ashes
   with various carbon and biomass contents. Tested fly ashes had carbon
   contents ranging from 1.1\% to 9.6\%, resulting from co-combusting coal
   with biomass (biomass contents ranging from 0\% to 8.2\% by weight). The
   small-strain stiffness and intermediate-strain constrained modulus were
   evaluated using consolidation tests performed in a modified oedometer
   cell equipped with bender elements. It was found that initial void ratio
   governed the compressibility (or constrained modulus) of fly ashes, and
   with an increase in carbon and biomass contents, the small-strain
   stiffness of fly ashes decreased due to the decrease in number of direct
   contacts between microspheres. In addition, the interfine void ratio,
   e(f), was employed instead of global void ratio to capture the
   alteration of interparticle contact or interparticle coordination
   between microspheres, due to the change in carbon and biomass contents.
   Finally, the stiffness in an overconsolidated state and the stiffness
   anisotropy of fly ashes were evaluated.}},

Title = {{Modeling of Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks with MAC, Queuing, and
   Cooperation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{We present a Markovian decision process (MDP) framework for multihop
   wireless sensor networks (MHWSNs) to bound the network performance of
   both energy constrained (EC) networks and energy harvesting (EH)
   networks, both with and without relay cooperation. The model provides
   the fundamental performance limit that a MHWSN can theoretically
   achieve, under the general constraints from medium access control,
   routing, and energy harvesting. We observe that the analyses for EC and
   EH networks fall into two branches of MDP theory, which are
   finite-horizon process and infinite-horizon process, respectively. The
   performance metrics for EC and EH networks are different. For EC
   networks, an appropriate metric is the network lifetime; for EH
   networks, an appropriate metric is, for example, the network throughput.
   To efficiently solve the models with high dimension, for the EC
   networks, we propose a novel computational algorithm by taking advantage
   of the stochastic shortest path structure of the problem; for the EH
   networks, we propose a dual linear programming based algorithm by
   considering the sparsity of the transition matrix. Under the unified MDP
   framework, numerical results demonstrate the advantages of cooperation
   for the optimal performance, in both EC and EH networks.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the interference effect, the reflectance and transmittance of an
   arbitrary linearly polarized wave cannot be fully described by the
   reflectance and transmittance of transverse electric and transverse
   magnetic waves. In this work, the polarization dependence of reflectance
   and transmittance for anisotropic metamaterials is examined. The
   explicit mathematical relationship between the Fresnel coefficients and
   the reflectance (or transmittance) for a given polarization angle is
   derived. A method is presented that can be used to obtain the
   reflectance (or transmittance) for any polarization angle from three
   other polarizations. Several different anisotropic metamaterials are
   numerically investigated with the finite-difference time-domain
   technique to elucidate the polarization dependence of reflectance or
   transmittance. The reflectance and transmittance obtained from the
   three-polarization-angle method are in agreement with those from the
   rigorous numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents recent kinetic and flame studies in plasma assisted
   low temperature combustion. First, the kinetic pathways of plasma
   chemistry to enhance low temperature fuel oxidation are discussed. The
   impacts of plasma chemistry on fuel oxidation pathways at low
   temperature conditions, substantially enhancing ignition and flame
   stabilization, are analyzed base on the ignition and extinction S-curve.
   Secondly, plasma assisted low temperature ignition, direct ignition to
   flame transition, diffusion cool flames, and premixed cool flames are
   demonstrated experimentally by using dimethyl ether and n-heptane as
   fuels. The results show that non-equilibrium plasma is an effective way
   to accelerate low temperature ignition and fuel oxidation, thus enabling
   the establishment of stable cool flames at atmospheric pressure.
   Finally, the experiments from both a non-equilibrium plasma reactor and
   a photolysis reactor are discussed, in which the direct measurements of
   intermediate species during the low temperature oxidations of
   methane/methanol and ethylene are performed, allowing the investigation
   of modified kinetic pathways by plasma-combustion chemistry
   interactions. Finally, the validity of kinetic mechanisms for plasma
   assisted low temperature combustion is investigated. Technical
   challenges for future research in plasma assisted low temperature
   combustion are then summarized.}},

   reduced to hydrogen. The electric energy consumption could be as low as
   0.69 kW h per normal cubic meter of H-2 (Nm(-3) H-2) at 0.2 A cm(-2),
   which is only 16.7\% of the energy consumed for the reported water

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{595-603}},
Abstract = {{The formation of irreversible Li2O during discharge is believed to be
   the main cause of large capacity loss and low Coulombic efficiency of
   oxide negative electrodes for Li batteries. This assumption may have
   misguided the development of high-capacity SnO2-based anodes in recent
   years. Here we demonstrated that contrary to this perception, Li2O can
   indeed be highly reversible in a SnO2 electrode with controlled
   nanostructure and achieved an initial Coulombic efficiency of similar to
   95.5\%, much higher than that previously believed to be possible
   (52.4\%). In situ spectroscopic and diffraction analyses corroborate
   highly reversible electrochemical cycling, suggesting that the
   interfaces and grain boundaries of nano-sized SnO2 may suppress the
   coarsening of Sn and enable the conversion between Li2O and Sn to
   amorphous SnO2 when de-lithiated. These results provide important
   insight into the rational design of high-performance oxide electrodes
   for Li-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of different searches for correlations
   between very high-energy neutrino candidates detected by IceCube and the
   highest-energy cosmic rays measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory and
   the Telescope Array. We first consider samples of cascade neutrino
   events and of high-energy neutrino-induced muon tracks, which provided
   evidence for a neutrino flux of astrophysical origin, and study their
   cross-correlation with the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) samples
   as a function of angular separation. We also study their possible
   directional correlations using a likelihood method stacking the neutrino
   arrival directions and adopting different assumptions on the size of the
   UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally, we perform another likelihood
   analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using a sample of
   through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source searches
   with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at
   discovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed. The
   smallest of the p-values comes from the search for correlation between
   UHECRs with IceCube high-energy cascades, a result that should continue
   to be monitored.}},

Title = {{Exosome-inspired targeting of cancer cells with enhanced affinity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{768-778}},
Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in the area of novel drug delivery systems
   (NDDSs) is finding distinguished ligands for specific receptors
   represented by many cancer cells in order to enhance their cancer homing
   efficacy. Exosomes, the so-called natural nanocarriers or ``Trojan
   horses,'' are secreted by the majority of cancer cells. These carriers
   exchange biomolecular information (e.g. proteins, siRNA, enzymes)
   between cancer cells and their stromal compartments in order to adjust a
   variety of cellular behaviours, including metastasis, apoptosis in T
   cells and angiogenesis. By exhibiting exosomal smart functions and
   biomimetic traits, exosome-mimicking nanocarriers will be one step ahead
   of the conventional targeted DDSs for the efficient delivery of
   antitumor drugs. In the present study, we tried to describe an
   engineering route to make some surface-functionalized nanoparticles that
   can mimic the targeting mechanism recruited by tumor-derived exosomes.
   The ligand-receptor interactions were investigated by molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations. In addition, the selected ligand was experimentally
   studied to verify its improved targeting efficacy. The present study
   describes a novel targeting method that forces the
   mucin-domain-containing molecule-4 (TIM4)-embellished nanoparticles
   (NPs) to swarm towards the cancerous cells. These NPs can interact with
   the phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor on the surface of several kinds of
   cancer cells, such as U-87 MG (glioblastoma cell line). The molecular
   affinity between TIM4 as a homing device and PS, the target receptor,
   was investigated using MD simulations and surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR). According to the calculated free energies and the cellular uptake
   of TIM4-functionalized NPs, it seems that the TIM4/PS complex releases
   enough free energy to induce endocytosis. Our results emphasize on the
   potential of the proposed ligand as a good candidate for many targeted
   drug delivery applications. In this report, we present our
   proof-of-concept results in order to spotlight the importance of using
   computer-based simulating methods at the molecular level for the
   next-generation nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To assess the microbiological effectiveness of several
   household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) options in situ in
   Tanzania, before consideration for national scale-up of HWTS.
   METHODS Participating households received supplies and instructions for
   practicing six HWTS methods on a rotating 5-week basis. We analysed 1202
   paired samples (source and treated) of drinking water from 390
   households, across all technologies. Samples were analysed for
   thermotolerant (TTC) coliforms, an indicator of faecal contamination, to
   measure effectiveness of treatment in situ.
   RESULTS All HWTS methods improved microbial water quality, with
   reductions in TTC of 99.3\% for boiling, 99.4\% for Waterguard (TM)
   brand sodium hypochlorite solution, 99.5\% for a ceramic pot filter,
   99.5\% for Aquatab (R) sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets,
   99.6\% for P\&G Purifier of Water (TM) flocculent/disinfectant sachets,
   and 99.7\% for a ceramic siphon filter. Microbiological performance was
   relatively high compared with other field studies and differences in
   microbial reductions between technologies were not statistically
   significant.
   CONCLUSIONS Given that microbiological performance across technologies
   was comparable, decisions regarding scale-up should be based on other
   factors, including uptake in the target population and correct,
   consistent, and sustained use over time.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{According to the chaotic features and typical fractional order
   characteristics of the bearing vibration intensity time series, a
   forecasting approach based on long range dependence (LRD) is proposed.
   In order to reveal the internal chaotic properties, vibration intensity
   time series are reconstructed based on chaos theory in phase-space, the
   delay time is computed with C-C method and the optimal embedding
   dimension and saturated correlation dimension are calculated via the
   Grassberger-Procaccia (G-P) method, respectively, so that the chaotic
   characteristics of vibration intensity time series can be jointly
   determined by the largest Lyapunov exponent and phase plane trajectory
   of vibration intensity time series, meanwhile, the largest Lyapunov
   exponent is calculated by the Wolf method and phase plane trajectory is
   illustrated using Duffing-Holmes Oscillator (DHO). The Hurst exponent
   and long range dependence prediction method are proposed to verify the
   typical fractional order features and improve the prediction accuracy of
   bearing vibration intensity time series, respectively. Experience shows
   that the vibration intensity time series have chaotic properties and the
   LRD prediction method is better than the other prediction methods
   (largest Lyapunov, auto regressive moving average (ARMA) and BP neural
   network (BPNN) model) in prediction accuracy and prediction performance,
   which provides a new approach for running tendency predictions for

Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{To fully realize the potential of lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable
   resource for the production of fuels, chemicals, and materials, an
   improved understanding of the chemical and molecular structures within
   biomass and how those structures are formed during biosynthesis and
   transformed during (thermochemical and biological) conversion must be
   developed. This effort will require analytical techniques which are not
   only in-depth, rapid, and cost-effective, but also leave native cell
   wall features intact. Whole plant cell wall nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) analysis facilitates unparalleled structural characterization of
   lignocellulosic biomass without causing (or with minimal) structural
   modification. The objective of this review is to summarize research
   pertaining to solution-or gel-state whole plant cell wall NMR analysis
   of biomass, demonstrating the capability of NMR to delineate the
   structural features and transformations of biomass. In particular, this
   review will focus on the application of a two-dimensional solution-state
   NMR technique and perdeuterated ionic liquid based organic electrolyte
   solvents for the direct dissolution and analysis of biomass. We believe
   this type of analysis will be critical to advancing biofuel research,
   improving bioprocessing methodology, and enhancing plant bioengineering
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Fe3O4 has long been regarded as a promising anode material for lithium
   ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, earth abundance, low
   cost, and nontoxic properties. At present, no effective method has been
   realized to overcome the bottleneck of poor cyclability and low rate
   capability because of its huge volume change and low electrical
   conductivity. In this article, a facile synthesis strategy is developed
   to fabricate two-dimensional (2D) carbon encapsulated hollow Fe3O4
   nanoparticles (H-Fe3O4 NPs) homogeneously anchored on graphene
   nanosheets (designated as H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs) as a durable high-rate lithium
   ion battery anode material. In the constructed architecture, the thin
   carbon shells can avoid the direct exposure of encapsulated H-Fe3O4 NPs
   to the electrolyte and preserve the structural and interfacial
   stabilization of H-Fe3O4 NPs. Meanwhile, the flexible and conductive
   GNSs and carbon shells can accommodate the mechanical stress induced by
   the volume change of H-Fe3O4 NPs as well as inhibit the aggregation of
   Fe3O4 NPs and thus maintain the structural and electrical integrity of
   the H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs electrode during the lithiation/delithiation
   processes. As a result, the H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs electrode exhibits
   outstanding reversible capacity (870.4 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 0.1C (1C
   = 1 A g(-1)) after 100 cycles) and excellent rate performance (745, 445,
   and 285 mA h g(-1) at 1, 5, and 10C, respectively) for lithium storage.
   More importantly, the H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs electrode demonstrates prolonged
   cycling stability even at high charge/discharge rates (only 6.8\%
   capacity loss after 200 cycles at a high rate of 10C). Our results show
   that the 2D H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs are promising anode materials for next
   generation LIBs with high energy and power density.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal changes of amygdala and default mode activation in
   adolescents prenatally exposed to cocaine}},
Journal = {{NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{24-32}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with long-term and
   negative effect on arousal regulation. Recent neuroimaging studies have
   examined brain mechanisms related to arousal dysregulation with
   cross-sectional experimental designs; but longitudinal changes in the
   brain, reflecting group differences in neurodevelopment, have never been
   directly examined. To directly assess the interaction of PCE and
   neurodevelopment, the present study used a longitudinal design to
   analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from
   33 adolescents (21 with PCE and 12 non-exposed controls) while they
   performed the same working memory task with emotional distracters at two
   points in time. The mean age of participants was 14.3 years at time\_1
   and 16.7 years at time\_2. With confounding factors statistically
   controlled, the fMRI data revealed significant exposure-by-time
   interaction in the activations of the amygdala and default mode network
   (DMN). For the control adolescents, brain activations associated with
   emotional arousal (amygdala) and cognitive effort (DMN) were both
   reduced at time\_2 as compared to that at time\_1. However, these
   activation reductions were not observed in the PCE group, indicating
   persistently high levels of emotional arousal and cognitive effort. In
   addition, correlations between longitudinal changes in the brain and in
   behavior have shown that adolescents with persistently high emotional
   arousal were more likely in need of high cognitive effort; and their
   cognitive performance was more likely to be affected by distractive
   challenges. The present results complement and extend previous findings
   from cross-sectional studies with further evidence supporting the view

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work is the design and characterization of novel
   nanostructured biopolymer films with improved features for wound
   dressing applications. Nanohybrid films based on chitosan and
   biofunctionalized montmorillonite (MMT) with chitosan sulfate chains
   (SMMT), as the macromolecular intercalant, were fabricated by a solvent
   casting method. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the exfoliated
   microstructure of the films. The presented results reveal that
   incorporation of SMMT into a chitosan matrix not only improves the
   physico-mechanical properties of films such as tensile strength, Young's
   modulus and thermal stability, but also decreases their moisture vapor
   transmission rate. The improvement in properties was found to be more
   pronounced for nanohybrid systems compared with the corresponding
   chitosan/MMT nanocomposite films. The superior characteristics of the
   designed chitosan/SMMT nanohybrid films was discussed in terms of the
   formation of electrostatic interactions at nanointerfaces based on
   thermogravimetry, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and atomic force
   microscopy techniques. The moisture vapor transmission rate of films was
   measured to be in the range of 690-860 g per m(2) per day, which makes
   them appropriate candidates as wound dressing systems for low and
   moderate exudates. The fabricated films were also evaluated for their
   biological features including in vitro cytotoxicity and antibacterial
   activity. It was disclosed that films are cytocompatible, and
   chitosan/SMMT nanohybrid films show significant bacteriostatic activity
   against Gram negative Escherichia coli.}},

Title = {{Multimodal travel groups and attitudes: A latent class cluster analysis
   of Dutch travelers}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{14-29}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For developing sustainable travel policies, it may be helpful to
   identify multimodal travelers, that is, travelers who make use of more
   than one mode of transport within a given period of time. Of special
   interest is identifying car drivers who also use public transport and/or
   bicycle, as this group is more likely to respond to policies that
   stimulate the use of those modes. It is suggested in the literature that
   this group may have,less biased perceptions and different attitudes
   towards those modes. This supposition is examined in this paper by
   conducting a latent class cluster analysis, which identifies
   (multi)modal travel groups based on the self-reported frequency of mode
   use. Simultaneously, a membership function is estimated to predict the
   probability of belonging to each of the five identified (multi)modal
   travel groups, as a function of attitudinal variables in addition to
   structural variables. The results indicate that the (near) solo car
   drivers indeed have more negative attitudes towards public transport and
   bicycle, while frequent car drivers who also use public transport have
   less negative public transport attitudes. Although the results suggest
   that in four of the five identified travel groups, attitudes are
   congruent with travel mode use, this is not the case for the group who
   uses public transport most often. This group has relatively favorable
   car attitudes, and given that many young, low-income travelers belong to
   this group, it may be expected that at least part of this group will
   start using car more often once they can afford it. Based on the
   results, challenges for sustainable policies are formulated for each of
   the identified (multi)modal travel groups. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Oriented attachment (OA), a nonclassical crystal growth mechanism,
   provides a powerful bottom-up approach to obtain ordered
   superstructures, which also demonstrate exciting charge transmission
   characteristic. However, ``there is little work observably pronouncing
   the achievement of 3D OA growth of crystallites with large size (e.g.,
   submicrometer crystals). Here, we report that SnO2 3D ordered
   superstructures can be synthesized by means of a self-limited assembly
   assisted by OA in a designed high-pressure solvothermal system. The size
   of primary building blocks is 200-250 nm, which is significantly larger
   than that in previous results (normally <10 nm). High pressure plays the
   key role in the formation of 3D configuration and fusion of adjacent
   crystals. Furthermore, this high-pressure strategy can be readily
   expanded to additional materials. We anticipate that the welded
   structures will constitute an ideal system with relevance to
   applications in optical responses, lithium ion battery, solar cells, and
   chemical sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Interfacial contact of two-dimensional graphene with three-dimensional
   metal electrodes is crucial to engineering high-performance
   graphene-based nanodevices with superior performance. Here, we report on
   the development of a rapid ``nanowelding{''} method for enhancing
   properties of interface to graphene buried under metal electrodes using
   a focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). High energy electron
   irradiation activates two-dimensional graphene structure by generation
   of structural defects at the interface to metal contacts with subsequent
   strong bonding via FEBID of an atomically thin graphitic interlayer
   formed by low energy secondary electron-assisted dissociation of
   entrapped hydrocarbon contaminants. Comprehensive investigation is
   conducted to demonstrate formation of the FEBID graphitic interlayer and
   its impact on contact properties of graphene devices achieved via strong
   electromechanical coupling at graphene metal interfaces. Reduction of
   the device electrical resistance by similar to 50\% at a Dirac point and
   by similar to 30\% at the gate voltage far from the Dirac point is
   obtained with concurrent improvement in thermomechanical reliability of
   the contact interface. Importantly, the process is rapid and has an
   excellent insertion potential into a conventional fabrication workflow
   of graphene-based nanodevices through single-step postprocessing
   modification of interfacial properties at the buried heterogeneous
   contact.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a flexible asymmetrical all-solid-state supercapacitor

   paper (FP) as the positive electrode and Ni/active carbon (AC) filter

   plating, was introduced to prepare the Ni/MnO2-FP electrode on the
   conventional laboratory FP, combined with the subsequent step of
   electrodeposition. Electrochemical results show that the as-prepared
   electrodes display outstanding areal specific capacitance (1900 mF/cm(2)
   at 5 mV/s) and excellent cycling performance (85.1\% retention after
   1000 cycles at 20 mA/cm(2)). Such a flexible supercapacitor assembled
   asymmetrically in the solid state exhibits a large volume energy density
   (0.78 mWh/cm(3)) and superior flexibility under different bending
   conditions. It has been demonstrated that the supercapacitors could be
   used as a power source to drive a 3 V light-emitting diode indicator.

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an exciting material
   due to its unique electrical, optical, and piezoelectric properties.
   Owing to an intrinsic band gap of 1.2-1.9 eV, monolayer or a-few layer
   MoS2 is used for fabricating field effect transistors (FETs) with high
   electron mobility and on/off ratio. However, the traditional FETs are
   controlled by an externally supplied gate voltage, which may not be
   sensitive enough to directly interface with a mechanical stimulus for
   applications in electronic skin. Here we report a type of
   top-pressure/force-gated field effect transistors (PGFETs) based on a
   hybrid structure of a 2D MoS2 flake and 1D ZnO nanowire (NW) array. Once
   an external pressure is applied, the piezoelectric polarization charges
   created at the tips of ZnO NWs grown on MoS2 act as a gate voltage to
   tune/control the source-drain transport property in MoS2. At a 6.25 MPa
   applied stimulus on a packaged device, the source drain current can be
   tuned for similar to 25\%, equivalent to the results of applying an
   extra-5 V back gate voltage. Another type of PGFET with a dielectric
   layer (Al2O3) sandwiched between MoS2 and ZnO also shows consistent
   results. A theoretical model is proposed to interpret the received data.
   This study sets the foundation for applying the 2D material-based FETs
   in the field of artificial intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible self-powered sensing is urgently needed for wearable, portable,
   sustainable, maintenance-free and long-term applications. Here, we,
   developed a flexible and self-powered GaN membrane-based ultraviolet
   (UV) photoswitch with high on/off ratio and excellent sensitivity. Even
   without any power supply, the driving force of UV photogenerated
   carriers can be well boosted by the combination of both built-in
   electric field and piezoelectric polarization field. The asymmetric
   metal-semiconductor-metal structure has been elaborately utilized to
   enhance the carrier separation and transport for highly sensitive UV
   photoresponse. Its UV on/off ratio and detection sensitivity reach to
   4.67 X 10(5) and 1.78 X 10(12) cm.Hz(0.5) W1-, respectively. Due to its
   excellent mechanical flexibility, the piezoelectric polarization field
   in GaN membrane can be easily tuned/controlled based on
   piezo-phototronic effect. Under 1\% strain, a stronger and broader
   depletion region can be obtained to further enhance UV on/off ratio up
   to 154\%. As a result, our research can not only provide a deep
   understanding of local electric field effects on self-powered
   optoelectronic detection, but also promote the development of
   self-powered flexible optoelectronic devices and integrated systems.}},

Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a promising mechanical energy
   harvesting technology, but its pulsed output and the instability of
   input energy sources make associated energy-storage devices necessary
   for real applications. In this work, feasible and efficient charging of
   Li-ion batteries by a rotating TENG with pulsed output current is
   demonstrated. In-depth discussions are made on how to maximize the
   power-storage efficiency by achieving an impedance match between the
   TENG and a battery with appropriate design of transformers. With a
   transformer coil ratio of 36.7, similar to 72.4\% of the power generated
   by the TENG at 250 rpm can be stored in an LiFePO4-Li4Ti5O12 battery.
   Moreover, a 1 h charging of an LiCoO2-C battery by the TENG at 600 rpm
   delivers a discharge capacity of 130 mAh, capable of powering many smart
   electronics. Considering the readily scale-up capability of the TENG,
   promising applications in personal electronics can be anticipated in the
   near future.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamically deployed Gurney flap was examined as an active control
   device for rotor vibration reduction. A CFD-CSD coupled analysis was
   carried out to include the aeroelastic effects and to maintain trimmed
   state. The four-bladed HART-II model was used as a representative rotor.
   A modeling method for dynamically deployed Gurney flap was established
   using dynamic wall boundary condition and infinitely thin flap model.
   2-D analyses were performed to investigate the unsteady air load
   response to the Gurney flap deployment, specifically the time lag
   effects, and the initial flap deployment schedules were established. The
   four-per-revolution deployments of the Gurney flap on lower and upper
   surfaces were simulated and the resulting vertical vibratory loads were
   compared with the baseline rotor. The simulations indicate that an 83\%
   reduction of the four-per-rev vibratory load may be achieved while
   maintaining the trim state without significant performance penalty. It
   was also shown that the four per-revolution vibratory load may also be
   virtually eliminated using an optimized deployment of the Gurney flap.
   Potential of individual control of segmented Gurney flaps targeting
   multiple signals was also demonstrated by suppressing eight-per-rev
   components of vibratory loads while minimizing four-per-rev vertical
   load simultaneously. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a set of thermal isolation technologies to provide a
   measure to thermally insulate low-power temperature-sensitive tiers from
   the time-varying power dissipation of high-power tier in heterogeneous
   3-D integrated circuits. The proposed technologies use an air gap and
   mechanically flexible interconnects (MFIs) to replace conventional
   microbumps and underfill. A two-tier testbed is fabricated to emulate a
   heterogeneous 3-D stack. The results are then benchmarked with a
   standard 3-D stacking approach that is simulated using finite-volume
   modeling. Compared with the conventional approach using microbumps and
   underfill, a temperature reduction of 35.9\% can be achieved in the
   low-power tier by implementing the air gap and MFIs. Four-point and
   daisy-chain resistances of the MFIs are measured to verify the
   electrical connectivity between the tiers during temperature cycling.}},

Title = {{Design and Demonstration of Power Delivery Networks With Effective
   Resonance Suppression in Double-Sided 3-D Glass Interposer Packages}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ultrathin 3-D glass interposers with through-package vias at the same
   pitch as through-silicon vias (TSVs) have been proposed as a simpler and
   cheaper alternative to the direct 3-D stacking of logic and memory
   devices. Such 3-D interposers provide wide-I/O channels for high signal
   bandwidth (BW) between the logic device on one side of the interposer
   and memory stack on the other side, without the use of complex TSVs in
   the logic die. However, this configuration introduces power delivery
   design challenges due to resonance from: 1) the low-loss property of the
   glass substrate and 2) the parasitic inductance due to additional length
   from lateral power delivery path. This paper presents for the first
   time, the design and demonstration of power delivery networks (PDNs) in
   30-mu m thin, 3-D double-sided glass interposers, by suppressing the
   noise from mode resonances. The self-impedance of the 3-D glass
   interposer PDN was simulated using electromagnetic solvers, including
   printed-wiring-board and chip-level models. The 3-D PDN was compared
   with that of the 2-D glass packages having fully populated ball grid
   array connections. The resonance mechanism for each configuration was
   studied in detail, and the corresponding PDN loop inductances were
   evaluated. High impedance peaks in addition to the 2-D PDN were observed
   at high frequencies (near 7.3 GHz) in the 3-D interposer structure due
   to the increased inductances from lateral power delivery. This paper
   proposes and evaluates three important resonance suppression techniques
   based on: 1) 3-D interposer die configuration; 2) the selection and
   placement of decoupling capacitors; and 3) 3-D interposer package power
   and ground stack-up. Two-metal and four-metal layer test vehicles were
   fabricated on 30- and 100-mu m thick panel-based glass substrates,
   respectively, to validate the modeling and analysis of the proposed
   approach. The PDN test structures were characterized up to 20 GHz for
   plane resonances and network impedances, with good model-to-hardware
   correlation. The results in this paper suggest that the ultrathin 3-D
   interposer PDN structure can be effectively designed to meet the target
   impedance guidelines for high-BW applications, providing a compelling
   alternative to 3-D-IC stacking with the TSVs.}},

Abstract = {{Traces derived from real-world traffic show that significant redundancy
   exists at the packet level in mobile network traffic. This has inspired
   new solutions to suppress the redundancy present in the packet data to
   manage the explosive traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
   to performing redundancy elimination by employing universal compression
   using memory-enabled overhearing helpers without backhaul connectivity,
   referred to as wireless network compression. The helpers overhear the
   data packets previously sent by the wireless gateway to various mobile
   clients within their coverage and use them as side information to reduce
   the overall communication cost. We study wireless network compression
   via overhearing helpers from an information-theoretic point of view and
   conclude that this approach potentially offers a threefold benefit: 1)
   offloading the wireless gateway and hence increasing the maximum number
   of mobile nodes the gateway can reliably serve; 2) reducing the average
   packet delay; and 3) improving the overall throughput in the network.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{The competence of geological carbon sequestration to a large extent
   relies on the short-term injection efficiency and the long-term
   capillary trapping and geological stability. This study uses a
   high-pressure micromodel and pore network simulation to investigate
   pore-scale displacement phenomena during the injection of supercritical
   carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) into brine-saturated reservoirs. Results show
   that the brine displacement can be enhanced by increasing the scCO(2)
   injection rate, but hindered by brine salinity which alters the
   interfacial contact properties and displacement patterns. The
   scCO(2)-brine displacement ratio increases with the capillary number
   N-c, increasing which by adding viscosifiers or surfactants would
   enhance the overall scCO(2) injection efficiency in microscopic flows.
   Results also suggest that better injection efficiency and capillary
   trapping capacity can be achieved in reservoirs with more
   widely-distributed pore sizes. It is not evident that mutual solubility
   and upscaling using the Leverett-J function readily allow to expand the
   injection efficiency results of microscopic flows to reservoirs; yet,
   the effects of salinity and pore size distribution on the scCO(2)-brine
   displacement process remain pertinent in both microscopic and
   macroscopic flows through porous media. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   responses in vivo, either by themselves as adjuvant, or by presenting
   antigens and/or co-stimulatory/inhibitory signals to the immune system.
   Therefore, intensive efforts are being devoted to investigating and
   applying synthetic polymeric nanoparticles in vaccine development and
   immunotherapy for cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.
   In this book chapter, we first introduce the main targets of particulate
   systems for immunomodulation, then talk about the factors that influence
   their function and performance in immunotherapy and lastly discuss the
   strategies that are currently in use or under investigation to treat
   immune diseases using synthetic polymeric nanoparticles.}},

Title = {{Construction of a 3D rGO-collagen hybrid scaffold for enhancement of the
   neural differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{1897-1904}},
Abstract = {{The cell-material interface is one of the most important considerations
   in designing a high-performance tissue engineering scaffold because the
   surface of the scaffold can determine the fate of stem cells. A
   conductive surface is required for a scaffold to direct stem cells
   toward neural differentiation. However, most conductive polymers are
   toxic and not amenable to biological degradation, which restricts the
   design of neural tissue engineering scaffolds. In this study, we used a
   bioactive three-dimensional (3D) porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM),
   which is mainly composed of type I collagen, as a basic material and
   successfully assembled a layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
   nanosheets on the surface of the PADM channels to obtain a porous 3D,
   biodegradable, conductive and biocompatible PADM-rGO hybrid neural
   tissue engineering scaffold. Compared with the PADM scaffold, assembling
   the rGO into the scaffold did not induce a significant change in the
   microstructure but endowed the PADM-rGO hybrid scaffold with good
   conductivity. A comparison of the neural differentiation of rat
   bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was performed by
   culturing the MSCs on PADM and PADM-rGO scaffolds in neuronal culture
   medium, followed by the determination of gene expression and
   immunofluorescence staining. The results of both the gene expression and
   protein level assessments suggest that the rGO-assembled PADM scaffold
   may promote the differentiation of MSCs into neuronal cells with higher
   protein and gene expression levels after 7 days under neural
   differentiation conditions. This study demonstrated that the PADM-rGO
   hybrid scaffold is a promising scaffold for neural tissue engineering;
   this scaffold can not only support the growth of MSCs at a high
   proliferation rate but also enhance the differentiation of MSCs into
   neural cells.}},

Pages = {{2268-2276}},
Abstract = {{The synthesis of few-layer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) via chemical vapor
   deposition typically results in highly non-uniform thickness due to
   nucleation initiated growth of triangular domains. In this work,
   few-layer p-type WSe2 with wafer-scale thickness and electrical
   uniformity is synthesized through direct selenization of thin films of
   e-beam evaporated W on SiO2 substrates. Raman maps over a large area of
   the substrate show small variations in the main peak position,
   indicating excellent thickness uniformity across several square
   centimeters. Additionally, field-effect transistors fabricated from the
   wafer-scale WSe2 films demonstrate uniform electrical performance across
   the substrate. The intrinsic field-effect mobility of the films at a
   carrier concentration of 3 x 10(12) cm(-2) is 10 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The
   unprecedented uniformity of the WSe2 on wafer-scale substrates provides
   a substantial step towards producing manufacturable materials that are
   compatible with conventional semiconductor fabrication processes.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{838-850}},
Abstract = {{alpha-Tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TOS) is a well-known mitochondrially
   targeted anticancer compound. However, a major factor limiting the use
   of alpha-TOS is its low solubility in physiological media. To overcome
   this problem, the aim of this work is the preparation of new polymeric
   and active alpha-TOS-based nanovehicle with a precise control over its
   macromolecular architecture. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain
   transfer polymerization (RAFT) is used to synthesize an alpha-TOS
   amphiphilic block copolymer with highly homogeneous molecular weight and
   relatively narrow dispersity. Macro-chain transfer agents (macro-CTA)
   based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different molecular weights (MW,
   ranging from 4.6 to 20 kDa) are used to obtain block copolymers with
   different hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios with PEG being the hydrophilic
   block and a methacrylic derivative of alpha-tocopheryl succinate (MTOS)
   being the monomer that formed the hydrophobic block. PEG-b-poly (MTOS)
   form spherical nanoparticles (NPs) by self-organized precipitation
   (SORP) or solvent exchange in aqueous media enabling to encapsulate and
   deliver hydrophobic molecules in their core. The resulting NPs are
   rapidly endocytosed by cancer cells. The biological activity of the
   synthesized NPs are found to depend on the MW of PEG, with the NP
   comprised of the higher MW copolymer resulting in a lower bioactivity
   due to PEG shielding, inhibiting cellular uptake by endocytosis.
   Moreover, the biological activity also depends on the MTOS content, as
   the biological activity increases as a function of MTOS concentration.}},

   activation energy of 0.29 eV is similar to technologically viable

Abstract = {{Purpose The healthcare system in the United States is spiraling out of
   control due to ever-increasing costs without significant improvements in
   quality, access to care, satisfaction, and efficiency. Efficient
   workflow is paramount to improving healthcare value while maintaining
   the utmost standards of patient care and provider satisfaction in high
   stress environments. This article provides healthcare managers and
   quality engineers with a practical healthcare process improvement
   framework to assess, measure and improve clinical workflow processes.
   Design and Methods: The proposed mixed-methods research framework
   integrates qualitative and quantitative tools to foster the improvement
   of processes and workflow in a systematic way. The framework consists of
   three distinct phases: 1) stakeholder analysis, 2a) survey design, 2b)
   time-motion study, and 3) process improvement.
   Results: The proposed framework is applied to the pediatric intensive
   care unit of the Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital. The
   implementation of this methodology led to identification and
   categorization of different workflow tasks and activities into both
   value-added and non-value added in an effort to provide more valuable
   and higher quality patient care.
   Conclusions: Based upon the lessons learned from the case study, the
   three-phase methodology provides a better, broader, leaner, and holistic
   assessment of clinical workflow. The proposed framework can be
   implemented in various healthcare settings to support continuous
   improvement efforts in which complexity is a daily element that impacts
   workflow.
   Practical Implications: We proffer a general methodology for process
   improvement in a healthcare setting, providing decision makers and
   stakeholders with a useful framework to help their organizations improve
   efficiency. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 {[}1,25(OH)2D3] and bone morphogenetic
   protein-2 (BMP2) are both used to stimulate osteoblastic
   differentiation. 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates osteoblasts through classical
   steroid hormone receptor mechanisms and through rapid responses that are
   mediated by two receptors, the traditional vitamin D receptor (VDR) and
   protein disulphide isomerase family A member 3 (Pdia3). The interaction
   between 1,25(OH)2D3 and BMP2, especially in three-dimensional (3D)
   culture, and the roles of the two vitamin D receptors in this
   interaction are not well understood. We treated wild-type (WT),
   Pdia3-silenced (Sh-Pdia3) and VDR-silenced (Sh-VDR) pre-osteoblastic
   MC3T3-E1 cells with either 1,25(OH)2D3, or BMP2, or with 1,25(OH)2D3 and
   BMP2 together, and measured osteoblast marker expression in 2D culture
   and mineralization in a 3D poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-collagen scaffold
   model. Quantitative PCR showed that silencing Pdia3 or VDR had a
   differential effect on baseline expression of osteoblast markers.
   1,25(OH)2D3+BMP2 caused a synergistic increase in osteoblast marker
   expression in WT cells, while silencing either Pdia3 or VDR attenuated
   this effect. 1,25(OH)2D3+BMP2 also caused a synergistic increase in Dlx5
   in both silenced cell lines. Micro-computed tomography (CT) showed that
   the mineralized volume of untreated Sh-Pdia3 and Sh-VDR 3D cultures was
   greater than that of WT. 1,25(OH)2D3 reduced mineral in WT and Sh-VDR
   cultures; BMP2 increased mineralization; and 1,25(OH)2D3+BMP2 caused a
   synergistic increase, but only in WT cultures. SEM showed that
   mineralized matrix morphology in 3D cultures differed for silenced cells
   compared to WT cells. These data indicate a synergistic crosstalk
   between 1,25(OH)2D3 and BMP2 toward osteogenesis and mineral deposition,
   involving both VDR and Pdia3. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{Citadel: Efficiently Protecting Stacked Memory from TSV and Large
   Granularity Failures}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Stacked memory modules are likely to be tightly integrated with the
   processor. It is vital that these memory modules operate reliably, as
   memory failure can require the replacement of the entire socket. To make
   matters worse, stacked memory designs are susceptible to newer failure
   modes (e.g., due to faulty through-silicon vias, or TSVs) that can cause
   large portions of memory, such as a bank, to become faulty. To avoid
   data loss from large-granularity failures, the memory system may use
   symbol-based codes that stripe the data for a cache line across several
   banks (or channels). Unfortunately, such data-striping reduces
   memory-level parallelism, causing significant slowdown and higher power
   consumption.
   This article proposes Citadel, a robust memory architecture that allows
   the memory system to retain each cache line within one bank. By
   retaining cache lines within banks, Citadel enables a high-performance
   and low-power memory system and also efficiently protects the stacked
   memory system from large-granularity failures. Citadel consists of three
   components; TSV-Swap, which can tolerate both faulty data-TSVs and
   faulty address-TSVs; Tri-Dimensional Parity (3DP), which can tolerate
   column failures, row failures, and bank failures; and Dynamic
   Dual-Granularity Sparing (DDS), which can mitigate permanent faults by
   dynamically sparing faulty memory regions either at a row granularity or
   at a bank granularity. Our evaluations with real-world data for DRAM
   failures show that Citadel provides performance and power similar to
   maintaining the entire cache line in the same bank, and yet provides
   700x higher reliability than ChipKill-like ECC codes.}},

Title = {{FAULTSIM: A Fast, Configurable Memory-Reliability Simulator for

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{As memory systems scale, maintaining their Reliability Availability and
   Serviceability (RAS) is becoming more complex. To make matters worse,
   recent studies of DRAM failures in data centers and supercomputer
   environments have highlighted that large-granularity failures are common
   in DRAM chips. Furthermore, the move toward 3D-stacked memories can make
   the system vulnerable to newer failure modes, such as those occurring
   from faults in Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). To architect future systems
   and to use emerging technology, system designers will need to employ
   strong error correction and repair techniques. Unfortunately, evaluating
   the relative effectiveness of these reliability mechanisms is often
   difficult and is traditionally done with analytical models, which are
   both error prone and time-consuming to develop. To this end, this
   article proposes FAULTSIM, a fast configurable memory-reliability
   simulation tool for 2D and 3D-stacked memory systems. FaultSim employs
   Monte Carlo simulations, which are driven by real-world failure
   statistics. We discuss the novel algorithms and data structures used in
   FaultSim to accelerate the evaluation of different resilience schemes.
   We implement BCH-1 (SECDED) and ChipKill codes using FaultSim and
   validate against an analytical model. FaultSim implements BCH-1 and
   ChipKill codes with a deviation of only 0.032\% and 8.41\% from the
   analytical model. FaultSim can simulate 1 million Monte Carlo trials
   (each for a period of 7 years) of BCH-1 and ChipKill codes in only 34
   seconds and 33 seconds, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Stentless porcine extracellular matrix tricuspid tubular
   valves have been developed for tricuspid valve reconstruction. The
   purpose of this study was to compare biomechanical and functional
   performance of native and tube graft valves in an acute porcine model.
   Methods. Twenty-two 65-kg pigs were randomized to tube graft or control
   with native valve preservation. Anterior papillary muscle force was
   measured with a dedicated force transducer. Microtip pressure catheters
   were placed in the right atrium and ventricle. Leaflet motion and
   three-dimensional valve geometry were evaluated using 13 sonomicrometry
   crystals: six in the tricuspid annulus, one on each leaflet free edge,
   one on each papillary muscle tip, and one in the right ventricular apex.
   Results. No regurgitation and no significant differences in
   intracavitary pressures, annular motion, or leaflet excursion angles
   were observed after tube graft implantation (p > 0.05). Compared with
   the native valve, the tricuspid annulus, leaflet orifice area, annular
   diameters, and the septal segment of the annulus were significantly
   smaller in the tube graft group (p < 0.05). Maximum anterior papillary
   muscle force was significantly lower in the tube graft group (p <
   0.005). The implantation technique led to an annular circumferential
   downsizing of 20\% +/- 17\%.
   Conclusions. An extracellular matrix tube graft implanted in the
   tricuspid position produces a competent valve with physiologic
   performance that, despite downsizing, makes the tube graft an attractive
   alternative to valve replacement. The downsizing of the implantation
   should be considered when planning tube graft size and may be
   potentially beneficial by relieving tension on the repaired tissue,
   thereby increasing durability. (C)2016 by The Society of Thoracic

Title = {{Hemodynamic Impact of Superior Vena Cava Placement in the Y-Graft Fontan
   Connection}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},

Abstract = {{Background. A Fontan Y-shaped graft using a commercially available
   aortoiliac graft has been used to connect the inferior vena cava (IVC)
   to the pulmonary arteries. This modification of the Fontan procedure
   seeks to improve hepatic flow distribution (HFD) to the lungs. However,
   patient-specific anatomical restrictions might limit the space available
   for graft placement. Altering the superior vena cava (SVC) positioning
   is hypothesized to provide more space for an optimal connection,
   avoiding caval flow collision. Computational modeling tools were used to
   retrospectively study the effect of SVC placement on Y-graft
   hemodynamics.
   Methods. Patient-specific anatomies (N = 10 patients) and vessel flows
   were reconstructed from retrospective cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
   images after Fontan Y-graft completion. Alternative geometries were
   created using a virtual surgery environment, altering the SVC position
   and the offset in relation to the Y-graft branches. Geometric
   characterization and computational fluid dynamics simulations were
   performed. Hemodynamic factors (power loss and HFD) were computed.
   Results. Patients with a higher IVC return showed less sensitivity to
   SVC positioning. Patients with low IVC flow showed varied HFD results,
   depending on SVC location. Balanced HFD values (50\% to each lung) were
   obtained when the SVC lay completely between the Y-graft branches. The
   effect on power loss was patient specific.
   Conclusions. SVC positioning with respect to the Y-graft affects HFD,
   especially in patients with lower IVC flow. Careful positioning of the
   SVC at the time of a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure based on
   patient-specific anatomy can optimize the hemodynamics of the eventual
   Fontan completion. (C) 2016 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Background: Electrical brain stimulation has shown promise for reducing
   seizures in drug-resistant epilepsy, but the electrical stimulation
   parameter space remains largely unexplored. New stimulation parameters,
   electrode types, and stimulation targets may be more effective in
   controlling seizures compared to currently available options.
   Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a novel electrical stimulation approach
   involving distributed multielectrode microstimulation at the epileptic
   focus would reduce seizure frequency in the tetanus toxin model of
   temporal lobe epilepsy.
   Methods: We explored a distributed multielectrode microstimulation (DMM)
   approach in which electrical stimulation was delivered through 15 33-mu
   m-diameter electrodes implanted at the epileptic focus (dorsal
   hippocampus) in the rat tetanus toxin model of temporal lobe epilepsy.
   Results: We show that hippocampal theta (6-12 Hz brain oscillations) is
   decreased in this animal model during awake behaving conditions compared
   to control animals (p < 10-4). DMM with biphasic, thetarange (6-12
   Hz/electrode) pulses delivered asynchronously on the 15 microelectrodes
   was effective in reducing seizures by 46\% (p < 0.05). When theta pulses
   or sinusoidal stimulation was delivered synchronously and continuously
   on the 15 microelectrodes, or through a single macroelectrode, no
   effects on seizure frequency were observed. High frequency stimulation
   (> 16.66 Hz/per electrode), in contrast, had a tendency to increase
   seizure frequency.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that DMM could be a new effective
   approach to therapeutic brain stimulation for reducing seizures in
   epilepsy. c 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed defect structure of dendrite formation was studied in order to
   connect the mesoscopic with the atomistic structure. It was demonstrated
   that twinning and stacking fault formation play a central role in the
   growth of electrodeposited Ag dendrites. The broad faces of Ag dendrites
   and the main trunk growth direction were found to be ((1) over bar 11)
   and {[}(1) over bar1 (2) over bar], respectively. Dendrite branches also
   formed and grew from the main trunk parallel to the {[}12 (1) over bar]
   and {[}(211) over bar] crystallographic directions. Twins and stacking
   faults were found to reside on the \{111\} crystallographic planes, as
   expected for a face centered cubic (FCC) Ag crystal. Using electron back
   scattered diffraction (EBSD) we found two variants of in-plane 60
   degrees rotational twin domains in the ((1) over bar 11) broad dendrite
   surface plane. The intersections of twins and stacking faults with
   dendrite arm surfaces are perpendicular to the (112) arm growth
   directions. However, occasionally twins on the \{111\} planes parallel
   to the (112) arm growth directions were also observed. Although defect
   assisted dendrite growth is facilitated by twinning and stacking fault
   formation on \{111\} planes, the growth directions of the trunk and
   branches are not of the (111) type, but rather close to (112). The (112)
   growth directions are maintained by breaking dendrite facets into
   thermodynamically stable 111 and 200 steps and structural ledges of
   different length.}},

Abstract = {{Multicycle rapid thermal annealing (MRTA) is shown to reduce the defect
   density of molecular beam epitaxially grown AN films. No damage to the
   AN surface occurred after performing the MRTA process at 1520 degrees C.
   However, the individual grain structure was altered, with the emergence
   of step edges. This change in grain structure and diffusion of AlN
   resulted in an improvement in the crystalline structure. The Raman E-2
   linewidth decreased, confirming an improvement in crystal quality. The
   optical band edge of the AlN maintained the expected value of 6.2 eV
   throughout MRTA annealing, and the band edge sharpened after MRTA
   annealing at increased temperatures, providing further evidence of
   crystalline improvement X-ray diffraction shows a substantial
   improvement in the (002) and (102) rocking curve FWHM for both the 1400
   and 1520 degrees C MRTA annealing conditions compared to the as-grown
   films, indicating that the screw and edge type dislocation densities
   decreased. Overall, the MRTA post-growth annealing of AN lowers defect
   density, and thus will be a key step to improving optoelectronic and
   power electronic devices.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Both species fitness difference'-based deterministic processes, such as
   competitive exclusion and environmental filtering, and species fitness
   difference'-independent stochastic processes, such as birth/death and
   dispersal/colonization, can influence the assembly of soil microbial
   communities. However, how both types of processes are mediated by
   anthropogenic environmental changes has rarely been explored. Here we
   report a novel and general pattern that almost all anthropogenic
   environmental changes that took place in a grassland ecosystem affected
   soil bacterial community assembly primarily through promoting or
   restraining stochastic processes. We performed four experiments
   mimicking 16 types of environmental changes and separated the
   compositional variation of soil bacterial communities caused by each
   environmental change into deterministic and stochastic components, with
   a recently developed method. Briefly, because the difference between
   control and treatment communities is primarily caused by deterministic
   processes, the deterministic change was quantified as (mean
   compositional variation between treatment and control) - (mean
   compositional variation within control). The difference among replicate
   treatment communities is primarily caused by stochastic processes, so
   the stochastic change was estimated as (mean compositional variation
   within treatment) - (mean compositional variation within control). The
   absolute of the stochastic change was greater than that of the
   deterministic change across almost all environmental changes, which was
   robust for both taxonomic and functional-based criterion. Although the
   deterministic change may become more important as environmental changes
   last longer, our findings showed that changes usually occurred through
   mediating stochastic processes over 5years, challenging the traditional
   determinism-dominated view.}},

Abstract = {{Tongue-Drive System (TDS) is a wireless and wearable assistive
   technology that enables people with severe disabilities to control their
   computers, wheelchairs, and smartphones using voluntary tongue motion.
   To evaluate the efficacy of the TDS, several experiments were conducted,
   in which the performance of nine able-bodied (AB) participants using a
   mouse, a keypad, and the TDS, as well as a cohort of 11 participants
   with tetraplegia (TP) using the TDS, were observed and compared.
   Experiments included the Fitts' law tapping, wheelchair driving,
   phone-dialing, and weight-shifting tasks over five to six consecutive
   sessions. All participants received a tongue piercing, wore a magnetic
   tongue stud, and completed the trials as evaluable participants.
   Although AB participants were already familiar with the keypad,
   throughputs of their tapping tasks using the keypad were only 1.4 times
   better than those using the TDS. The completion times of wheelchair
   driving task using the TDS for AB and TP participants were between 157 s
   and 180 s with three different control strategies. Participants with TP
   completed phone-dialing and weight-shifting tasks in 81.9 s and 71.5 s,
   respectively, using tongue motions. Results showed statistically
   significant improvement or trending to improvement in performance status
   over the sessions. Most of the learning occurred between the first and
   second sessions, but trends did suggest that more practice would lead to
   increased improvement in performance using the TDS.}},

Abstract = {{A modified version of the rough hard sphere (RHS) scheme of Gacino et
   al. has been used to correlate the viscosity and thermal conductivity of
   ILs. A total of 661 viscosity data at 0.1 MPa for 48 ILs, and 159
   thermal conductivity data at 0.1 MPa for 26 ILs were correlated, with
   average absolute deviations between calculated and experimental values
   (AAD) of 1.15\% in the case of the viscosity and 2.32\% in the case of
   the thermal conductivity. In addition, a total of 453 viscosity data for
   10 ILs and 95 thermal conductivity data for 9 ILs over a pressure range
   of 0.1 MPa to 35.6 MPa were correlated with AADs of 3.46\% in the case
   of the viscosity and 2.89\% in the case of the thermal conductivity.
   More importantly, the three parameters of the modified RHS scheme were
   found to exhibit regular trends with the molecular weight of ILs with a
   common anion. Finally, IL mixture viscosities were predicted within
   their experimental uncertainties using a simple mixing rule. Mixtures of
   water and ILs could also be accommodated within the RHS scheme, although
   errors were higher in this case.}},

Title = {{Assessing Conceptual Knowledge Using Three Concept Map Scoring Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundConceptual understanding is a prerequisite for engineering
   competence. Concept maps may be effective tools for assessing conceptual
   knowledge, yet further work is needed to examine scoring methods.
   PurposeOur purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of three concept map
   scoring methods. Traditional scoring requires judges to count concept
   map components. Holistic scoring requires judges to analytically
   evaluate concept maps using a rubric. Categorical scoring requires
   judges to categorize concepts according to relevant categories before
   quantification of overall complexity.
   Design/MethodIn this study, concept maps were collected from 72
   undergraduates before and after a capstone design course. Judges
   analyzed the concept maps using three methods. Using statistical
   analyses, we examined the comparability, interrater reliability, and
   convergent/divergent validity of scoring methods.
   ResultsWhile traditional scoring allowed judges to score concept maps
   relatively quickly, holistic scoring allowed judges to better capture
   changes in knowledge structure, because ranking of data was required
   without assuming hierarchical concept arrangement. Only categorical
   scoring provided insight into content and structure of student
   knowledge. For all methods, interrater reliability was acceptable, and
   convergent/divergent validity was established.
   ConclusionsDue to its applicability to concept maps of varying
   structures, holistic scoring is best if more than one judge is
   available; traditional scoring is appropriate if there are time
   constraints or if multiple methods are used. Categorical scoring has
   potential as a supplemental or stand-alone method, depending on the
   needs of the instructor or researcher.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{603-610}},
Abstract = {{Many proposed applications for electrochromic polymers (ECPs), which are
   designed to modulate the intensity or spectral power density of light,
   center around the interaction between the ECPs and the incident light.
   The long-term effects of the interaction of light and ECPs are rarely
   discussed in the literature, yet is a crucial parameter in materials
   evaluation in many applications. With the goal of examining the
   photo-stability of select ECPs, two polymers were selected for study,
   which are representative of both 3,4-dioxythiophene (DOT) and
   3,4-dioxypyrrole (DOP) based materials. Samples of each material were
   sealed in glass cells under varying atmospheric conditions using a
   polyisobutylene-based barrier sealant and irradiated under a solar
   simulator for time periods ranging from 24 hours to one month. Following
   irradiation, electrochromic performance was assessed via both
   electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. Additionally, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study chemical changes
   following irradiation. We report here that, following irradiation, no
   change in electrochromic performance (as measured by Delta\%T at
   lambda(max)) nor spectra recorded via XPS was observed in films
   encapsulated under an inert atmosphere, suggesting that conditions of
   irradiation alone are insufficient to degrade the performance of either
   ECP structure.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to assess the characteristics of
   seismic induced damage and the deformation patterns of pre-stressed
   cement-grouted cables that are used for rock slope stabilization
   projects subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. The experimental
   configuration includes the installation of 15 pre-stressed cables in a
   slope model made of concrete blocks (theoretically rigid rock mass) on
   top of a pre-existing sliding surface. The study showed that: (i) The
   pre-stressed cables exhibited great seismic performance. Rapid
   displacement of the model blocks was observed after the complete loss of
   the initial pre-stress load under continued applied cyclic loads and
   exceedance of the state of equilibrium, which implies the higher the
   initial pre-stress load, the better the seismic performance of the rock
   anchor; (ii) The failure of the pre-stressed cables was due to fracture
   at the connection of the tendons and cable heads under cyclic loading.
   The sequence of failure had a distinct pattern. Failure was first
   observed at the upper row of cables, which experienced the most severe
   damage, including the ejection of cable heads. No evidence of de-bonding
   was observed during the cyclic loading; (iii) The stress distribution of
   the bond length for pre-stressed cables was highly non-uniform. High
   stress concentrations were observed at both the fixed end and the free
   end of the bond length both before and immediately after the state of
   equilibrium is exceeded. The results obtained can be used to evaluate
   the overall performance of pre-stressed rock anchors subject to seismic
   loading and their potential as rockfall prevention and stabilization
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoscale eddies may drive a significant component of cross-shelf
   transport important in the ecology of shelf ecosystems and adjacent
   boundary currents. The Leeuwin Current in the eastern Indian Ocean
   becomes unstable in the austral autumn triggering the formation of
   eddies. We hypothesized that eddy formation represented the major driver
   of cross-shelf transport during the autumn. Acoustic Doppler Current
   Profiler profiles confirmed periodic offshore movement of similar to 2
   Sv of shelf waters into the forming eddy from the shelf, carrying a load
   of organic particles (>0.06 mm). The gap between inflow and outflow then
   closed, such that the eddy became isolated from further direct input of
   shelf waters. Drifter tracks supported an anticyclonic surface flow
   peaking at the eddy perimeter and decreasing in velocity at the eddy
   center. Oxygen and nutrient profiles suggested rapid remineralization of
   nitrate mid-depth in the isolated water mass as it rotated, with a total
   drawdown of oxygen of 3.6 mol m(-2) to 350 m. Depletion of oxygen, and
   release of nitrate, occurred on the timescale of similar to 1 week. We
   suggest that N supply and N turnover are rapid in this system, such that
   nitrate is acting primarily as a regenerated nutrient rather than as a
   source of new nitrogen. We hypothesize that sources of eddy particulate
   C and N could include particles sourced from coastal primary producers
   within similar to 500 km such as macrophytes and seagrasses known to
   produce copious detritus, which is prone to resuspension and offshore
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring patient adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) by
   patient survey is inherently error prone, justifying a need for
   objective, biological measures affordable in low-resource settings where
   HIV/AIDS epidemic is highest. In preliminary studies conducted in
   Ethiopia and South Africa, we observed loss of cysteine cathepsin
   activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-positive patients
   on ART. We optimized a rapid protocol for multiplex cathepsin zymography
   to quantify cysteine cathepsins, and prospectively enrolled 350
   HIV-positive, ART-na < ve adults attending the Themba Lethu Clinic,
   Johannesburg, South Africa, to test if suppressed cathepsin activity
   could be a biomarker of ART adherence (103 patients were included in
   final analysis). Poor adherence was defined as detectable viral load (>
   400 copies/ml) or simplified medication adherence questionnaire, 4-6
   months after ART initiation. 86 \% of patients with undetectable viral
   loads after 6 months were cathepsin negative, and cathepsin-positive
   patients were twice as likely to have detectable viral loads (RR 2.32 95
   \% CI 1.26-4.29). Together, this demonstrates proof of concept that
   multiplex cathepsin zymography may be an inexpensive, objective method
   to monitor patient adherence to ART. Low cost of this
   electrophoresis-based assay makes it a prime candidate for
   implementation in resource-limited settings.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have potential to be the cleanest and
   most efficient electrochemical energy conversion devices with excellent
   fuel flexibility. To make SOFC systems more durable and economically
   competitive, however, the operation temperature must be significantly
   reduced, which depends sensitively on the development of highly active
   electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at low
   temperatures. Here we report a novel silver nanoparticle-decorated
   perovskite oxide, prepared via a facile exsolution process from a
   Sr0.95Ag0.05Nb0.1Co0.9O3-delta (SANC) perovskite precursor, as a highly
   active and robust ORR electrocatalyst for low-temperature SOFCs. The
   exsolved Sr0.95Ag0.05Nb0.1Co0.9O3-delta (denoted as e-SANC) electrode is
   very active for ORR, achieving a very low area specific resistance
   (similar to 0.214 Omega cm(2) at 500 degrees C). An anode-supported cell
   with the new heterostructured cathode demonstrates very high peak power
   density (1116 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C) and stable operation for 140 h
   at a current density of 625 mA cm(-2). The superior ORR activity and
   stability are attributed to the fast oxygen surface exchange kinetics
   and the firm adhesion of the Ag nanoparticles to the
   Sr0.95Nb0.1Co0.9O3-delta (SNC0.95) support. Moreover, the e-SANC cathode
   displays improved tolerance to CO2. These unique features make the new
   heterostructured material a highly promising cathode for low-temperature
   SOFCs.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{57-73}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Previous models based on thermodynamic considerations have identified
   the properties desired for reactive oxides that can be used as oxygen
   storage materials in thermochemical cycles to produce fuel from
   sunlight. However, there are several important assumptions made in such
   models, such as the neglect of the energy required to preheat unreacted
   species and the assumption of constant vacuum pump efficiency. When
   these assumptions are relaxed, one comes to significantly different
   conclusions about the optimal reactor operating conditions. Furthermore,
   comparing two materials is not straightforward due to the high degree of
   coupling between material properties and reactor operating conditions.
   Herein, we describe a new framework for material comparison which
   employs a thermodynamic reactor model to predict the maximum possible
   efficiency of a given oxygen storage material. This model demonstrates
   how new materials can impact reactor performance and the limitations of
   such improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{460-468}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The kinetic and mechanistic understanding of cooperatively catalyzed
   aldol and nitroaldol condensations is probed using a series of
   mesoporous silicas functionalized with aminosilanes to provide
   bifunctional acid base character. Mechanistically, a Hammett analysis is
   performed to determine the effects of electron-donating and
   electron-withdrawing groups of para-substituted benzaldehyde derivatives
   on the catalytic activity of each condensation reaction. This
   information is also used to discuss the validity of previously proposed
   catalytic mechanisms and to propose a revised mechanism with plausible
   reaction intermediates. For both reactions, electron-withdrawing groups
   increase the observed rates of reaction, though resonance effects play
   an important, yet subtle, role in the nitroaldol condensation, in which
   a p-methoxy electron-donating group is also able to stabilize the
   proposed carbocation intermediate. Additionally, activation energies and
   pre-exponential factors are calculated via the Arrhenius analysis of two
   catalysts with similar amine loadings: one catalyst had silanols
   available for cooperative interactions (acid base catalysis), while the
   other was treated with a silanol-capping reagent to prevent such
   cooperativity (base-only catalysis). The values obtained for activation
   energies and pre-exponential factors in each reaction are discussed in
   the context of the proposed mechanisms and the importance of cooperative
   interactions in each reaction. The catalytic activity decreases for all
   reactions when the silanols are capped with trimethylsilyl groups, and
   higher temperatures are required to make accurate rate measurements,
   emphasizing the vital role the weakly acidic silanols play in the
   catalytic cycles. The results indicate that loss of acid sites is more
   detrimental to the catalytic activity of the aldol condensation than the
   nitroaldol condensation, as evidenced by the significant decrease in the
   pre-exponential factor for the aldol condensation when silanols are
   unavailable for cooperative interactions. Cooperative catalysis is
   evidenced by significant changes in the pre-exponential factor, rather
   than the activation energy for the aldol condensation.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a stylized three dimensional benchmark problem based

   levels while the geometry and material compositions are both fully
   described. Material nuclear data is provided in the form of a set of 15
   group macroscopic cross sections which were developed so that the
   benchmark specification could be used for transport code method
   verification.
   Using this benchmark and 15 group cross sections, the Coarse Mesh
   Transport Method (COMET) code was verified against the Monte Carlo code
   MCNP. Results were generated for three separate core cases: control rods
   out, near critical, and control rods in. Eigenvalue comparison results
   between COMET and MCNP are within 50 pcm for all three cases, well
   within two standard deviations of the stochastic uncertainty of the
   solution methods. The fission density results are highly accurate with a
   pin fission density average discrepancy between COMET and MCNP of less
   than 0.5\% for each model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work examined the effects of milling using a gravity ball mill on
   the reactivity of natural zeolites used as supplementary cementitious

   quantitative x-ray diffraction, particle size analysis, pore size
   distribution and surface area analysis. Following material
   characterization, the pozzolanic reactivity of the zeolites was
   determined by measuring the quantity of calcium hydroxide in paste after
   28 or 90 days and by tracking the compressive strength of zeolite-cement
   mortars. Results showed that a critical milling time exists,
   corresponding to a d50 of 7-9 gm, after which reductions in particle
   size can no longer be achieved and zeolite performance can no longer be

Title = {{Efficient and Transparent Use of personal device storage in
   opportunistic data forwarding}},

Abstract = {{We consider a growing research trend of using personal mobile devices
   for forwarding opportunistic network data. Because personal device
   storage is meant to support user applications, opportunistic networks
   must use it in a manner that remains completely transparent to the user.
   One way to make a device's storage use transparent is to allow priority
   access to the storage to user applications, even if the storage is
   currently occupied by network data yet to be forwarded. This means that
   data given to a device waiting to be forwarded can be overwritten by
   application data and may, thus, be lost. In this paper we consider
   random access memory (RAM) as the primary storage location in a mobile
   device. We propose three algorithms of different sophistications to
   answer the question of how much data should be moved when a contact
   opportunity arises between two devices in such a way to first maximise
   the data transferred while minimising the probability that this data
   will be overwritten when applications claim priority access. We collect
   33 h of high-resolution RAM usage traces of two real smartphones over a
   3-day period under a variety of usage scenarios to evaluate and compare
   the performances of the proposed algorithms. Surprisingly, we find that
   autoregression forecasting of RAM usage cannot outperform the simplest
   algorithm that greedily occupies all of the RAM that is found unused at
   the time of contact. We show that Bayesian inference is very effective
   in minimising the risk of data loss in such uncertain environments and
   significantly outperforms the greedy approach as well as autoregression
   forecasting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   likely to be incurred during non-major combat operations is essential to
   effectively plan for medical resources required to support those

   approximately solved by means of Nesterov's optimal method. We then
   establish a bound on the total number of Nesterov's optimal iterations,
   i.e., the inner iterations, performed throughout the entire inexact AL
   method to obtain a near primal-dual optimal solution. We also present
   variants with possibly better iteration-complexity bounds than the
   original inexact AL method, which consist of applying the original
   approach directly to a perturbed problem obtained by adding a strongly
   convex component to the objective function of the CP problem.}},

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cell aggregates offer an attractive approach to emulate
   embryonic morphogenesis and skeletal development. Calcium phosphate
   (Cap) based biomaterials have been shown to promote bone healing due to
   their osteoconductive and potential osteoinductive properties. In this
   study, we hypothesized that incorporation of Cap-coated hydroxyapatite
   mineral particles (MPs) within murine embryonic stem cell (ESC)
   aggregates could promote osteo-chondrogenic differentiation. Our results
   demonstrated that MP alone dose-dependently promoted the gene expression
   of chondrogenic and early osteogenic markers. In combination with
   soluble osteoinductive cues, MPs enhanced the hypertrophic and
   osteogenic phenotype, and mineralization of ESC aggregates.
   Additionally, MPs dose-dependently reduced ESC pluripotency and thereby
   decreased the size of teratomas derived from MP-incorporated ESC
   aggregates in vivo. Our data suggested a novel yet simple means of using
   mineral particles to control stem cell fate and create an osteochondral
   niche for skeletal tissue engineering applications.
   Statement of Significance
   Directing stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis via biomaterials
   represents a novel strategy to promote cell fates and tissue formation.
   Our study demonstrates the ability of calcium phosphate-based mineral
   particles to promote osteochondrogenic differentiation of embryonic stem
   cell aggregates as well as modulate teratoma formation in vivo. This
   hybrid biomaterial-ESC aggregate approach serves as an enabling platform
   to evaluate the ability of biomaterials to regulate stem cell fate and
   regenerate functional skeletal tissues for clinical applications. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding the role of SCN8A in epilepsy and behavior is critical in
   light of recently identified human SCN8A epilepsy mutations. We have
   previously demonstrated that Scn8a(med) and Scn8a(med-Jo) mice carrying
   mutations in the Scn8a gene display increased resistance to flurothyl
   and kainic acid-induced seizures; however, they also exhibit spontaneous
   absence seizures. To further investigate the relationship between
   altered SCN8A function and epilepsy, we introduced the SCN1A-R1648H
   mutation, identified in a family with generalized epilepsy with febrile
   seizures plus (GEFS+), into the corresponding position (R1627H) of the
   mouse Scn8a gene. Heterozygous R1627H mice exhibited increased
   resistance to some forms of pharmacologically and electrically induced
   seizures and the mutant Scn8a allele ameliorated the phenotype of
   Scn1a-R1648H mutants. Hippocampal slices from heterozygous R1627H mice
   displayed decreased bursting behavior compared to wild-type littermates.
   Paradoxically, at the homozygous level, R1627H mice did not display
   increased seizure resistance and were susceptible to audiogenic
   seizures. We furthermore observed increased hippocampal pyramidal cell
   excitability in heterozygous and homozygous Scn8a-R1627H mutants, and
   decreased intemeuron excitability in heterozygous Scn8a-R1627H mutants.
   These results expand the phenotypes associated with disruption of the
   Scn8a gene and demonstrate that an Scn8a mutation can both confer
   seizure protection and increase seizure susceptibility. (C) 2015

Title = {{HERPUD1 protects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through

Abstract = {{Homocysteine-inducible, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducible,
   ubiquitin-like domain member 1 (HERPUD1), an ER resident protein, is
   upregulated in response to ER stress and Ca2(+) homeostasis
   deregulation. HERPUD1 exerts cytoprotective effects in various models,
   but its role during oxidative insult remains unknown. The aim of this
   study was to investigate whether HERPUD1 contributes to cytoprotection
   in response to redox stress and participates in mediating
   stress-dependent signaling pathways. Our data showed that HERPUD1
   protein levels increased in HeLa cells treated for 30 min with H2O2 or
   angiotensin II and in aortic tissue isolated from mice treated with
   angiotensin II for 3 weeks. Cell death was higher in HERPUD1 knockdown
   (sh-HERPUD1) HeLa cells treated with H2O2 in comparison with control
   (sh-Luc) HeLa cells. This effect was abolished by the intracellular
   Ca2(+) chelating agent BAPTA-AM or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
   receptor (ITPR) antagonist xestospongin B, suggesting that the response
   to H2O2 was dependent on intracellular Ca2(+) stores and the ITPR.
   Ca2(+) kinetics showed that sh-HERPUD1 HeLa cells exhibited greater and
   more sustained cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2(+) increases than sh-Luc
   HeLa cells. This higher sensitivity of sh-HERPUD1 HeLa cells to H2O2 was
   prevented with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor
   cyclosporine A. We concluded that the HERPUD1-mediated cytoprotective
   effect against oxidative stress depends on the ITPR and Ca2(+) transfer
   from the ER to mitochondria. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{It has been recently proven that the semidefinite programming (SDP)
   relaxation of the optimal power flow problem over radial networks is
   exact under technical conditions such as not including generation lower
   bounds or allowing load over-satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate
   the situation where generation lower bounds are present. We show that
   even for a 2-bus 1-generator system, the SDP relaxation can have all
   possible approximation outcomes, that is 1) SDP relaxation may be exact,
   2) SDP relaxation may be inexact, or 3) SDP relaxation may be feasible
   while the optimal power flow (OPF) instance may be infeasible. We
   provide a complete characterization of when these three approximation
   outcomes occur and an analytical expression of the resulting optimality
   gap for this 2-bus system. In order to facilitate further research, we
   design a library of instances over radial networks in which the SDP
   relaxation has positive optimality gap. Finally, we propose valid
   inequalities and variable bound tightening techniques that significantly
   improve the computational performance of a global optimization solver.
   Our work demonstrates the need of developing efficient global
   optimization methods for the solution of OPF even in the simple but
   fundamental case of radial networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a transformative architecture for the normal
   operation and self-healing of networked microgrids (MGs). MGs can
   support and interchange electricity with each other in the proposed
   infrastructure. The networked MGs are connected by a physical common bus
   and a designed two-layer cyber communication network. The lower layer is
   within each MG where the energy management system (EMS) schedules the MG
   operation; the upper layer links a number of EMSs for global
   optimization and communication. In the normal operation mode, the
   objective is to schedule dispatchable distributed generators (DGs),
   energy storage systems (ESs), and controllable loads to minimize the
   operation costs and maximize the supply adequacy of each MG. When a
   generation deficiency or fault happens in an MG, the model switches to
   the self-healing mode and the local generation capacities of other MGs
   can be used to support the on-emergency portion of the system. A
   consensus algorithm is used to distribute portions of the desired power
   support to each individual MG in a decentralized way. The allocated
   portion corresponds to each MG's local power exchange target, which is
   used by its EMS to perform the optimal schedule. The resultant
   aggregated power output of networked MGs will be used to provide the
   requested power support. Test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Germanium (Ge) is a promising candidate anode material for
   next-generation, high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Despite its
   apparent promise, the mechanical properties of lithiated Ge including
   its fracture characteristic are largely unknown. In this paper, we
   report the first experimental measurement of the fracture toughness of
   lithiated Ge using an in-house developed nanoindentation system. The
   fracture toughness of lithiated Ge is found to increase monotonically
   with increasing lithium content, indicating a brittle-to-ductile
   transition of lithiated Ge as lithiation proceeds. We also compare the
   fracture energy of lithiated Ge with that of lithiated Si and show that,
   despite a slightly lower fracture energy of Ge than that of Si in the
   unlithiated state, Ge possesses much higher fracture resistance than Si
   in the lithiated state. These findings suggest that Ge anodes are
   intrinsically more resistant to fracture than their Si counterparts,
   thereby offering substantial potential for the development of durable,
   high-capacity, and high-rate lithium-ion batteries. The quantitative
   results from this work provide fundamental insights for developing new
   electrode materials and help to enable predictive modeling of
   high-performance lithium-ion batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{A new nonlinear ultrasonic technique for nondestructive evaluation of
   concrete components is developed and implemented to characterize the
   effects of carbonation on concrete. The physical principle of this
   method is the second harmonic generation (SHG) in propagating Rayleigh
   surface waves which are detected by a non-contact air-coupled
   transducer. The nonlinearity parameter, as an indicator of material
   properties, is experimentally obtained from measured Rayleigh wave
   signals and is used to quantitatively evaluate the progress of
   carbonation under accelerated conditions. The experimental results show
   that there is a significant decrease in the measured nonlinearity
   parameter, most likely originated from the deposit of the carbonation
   product, CaCO3, in pre-existing voids and microcracks. The sensitivity
   of the nonlinearity parameter is also verified by comparing with the
   measured Rayleigh wave velocity. The results in this paper demonstrate
   that the SHG technique using Rayleigh surface waves can be used to
   monitor carbonation in concrete.}},

Abstract = {{As investment in residential photovoltaic systems is increasing at a
   rapid pace, it is important to investigate whether delaying or otherwise
   timing these investments can maximize long term investment gains.
   Conventional financial analysis methods for evaluating investment
   decisions in solar-electric system are all based on a one-time
   installation of the PV systems and cannot be applied to analyze the
   benefit of delayed and staged investment. Such benefits could be
   declining costs of PV systems thus tempting investors to hold off and
   wait for a better moment to invest. This paper proposes a decision
   making framework using the real option method to analyze the optimum
   time to invest in a residential PV system in different scenarios. A
   reference residential house is used to test the effect of different
   investment strategies. The results show the type of staged investment of
   installing residential PV system that maximizes the long-term payoff.
   This reveals when the option to delay investment is preferred. The

Title = {{Spatially localized recruitment of anti-inflammatory monocytes by SDF-1
   alpha-releasing hydrogels enhances microvascular network remodeling}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{280-290}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Tissue repair processes are characterized by the biphasic recruitment of
   distinct subpopulations of blood monocytes, including classical
   ({''}inflammatory{''}) monocytes (IMs, Ly6C(hi)Gr1(+)CX3CR1(lo)) and
   non-classical anti-inflammatory monocytes (AMs,
   Ly6C(lo)Gr1(-)CX3CR1(hi)). Drug-eluting biomaterial implants can be used
   to tune the endogenous repair process by the preferential recruitment of
   pro-regenerative cells. To enhance recruitment of AMs during
   inflammatory injury, a novel N-desulfated heparin-containing
   poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogel was engineered to
   deliver exogenous stromal derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha),
   utilizing the natural capacity of heparin to sequester and release
   growth factors. SDF-1 alpha released from the hydrogels maintained its
   bioactivity and stimulated chemotaxis of bone marrow cells in vitro.
   Intravital microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrated that SDF-1 alpha
   hydrogels implanted in a murine dorsal skinfold window chamber promoted
   spatially-localized recruitment of AMs relative to unloaded internal
   control hydrogels. SDF-1 alpha delivery stimulated arteriolar remodeling
   that was correlated with AM enrichment in the injury niche. SDF-1 alpha,
   but not unloaded control hydrogels, supported sustained arteriogenesis
   and microvascular network growth through 7 days. The recruitment of AMs
   correlated with parameters of vascular remodeling suggesting that tuning
   the innate immune response by biomaterial SDF-1 alpha release is a
   promising strategy for promoting vascular remodeling in a spatially
   controlled manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{MMP-mediated mesenchymal morphogenesis of pluripotent stem cell
   aggregates stimulated by gelatin methacrylate microparticle
   incorporation}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM)
   to facilitate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) and promote
   cell specification during embryonic development. In this study, we
   hypothesized that introducing degradable ECM-based biomaterials to
   pluripotent stem cell (PSC) aggregates would modulate endogenous
   proteolytic activity and consequently enhance the differentiation and
   morphogenesis within 3D PSC aggregates. Gelatin methacrylate (GMA)
   microparticles (MPs) of low (similar to 20\%) or high (similar to 90\%)
   cross-linking densities were incorporated into mouse embryonic stem cell
   (ESC) aggregates, and the effects on MMP activity and cell
   differentiation were examined with or without MMP inhibition. ESC
   aggregates containing GMA MPs expressed significantly higher levels of
   total MMP and MMP-2 than aggregates without MPs. GMA MP incorporation
   increased expression of EMT markers and enhanced mesenchymal
   morphogenesis of PSC aggregates. MMP inhibition completely abrogated
   these effects, and GMA MP-induced MMP activation within ESC aggregates
   was partially reduced by pSMAD 1/5/8 inhibition. These results suggest
   that GMA particles activate MMPs by protease-substrate interactions to
   promote EMT and mesenchymal morphogenesis of ESC aggregates in an
   MMPdependent manner. We speculate that controlling protease activity via
   the introduction of ECM-based materials may offer a novel route to
   engineer the ECM microenvironment to modulate stem cell differentiation.

Title = {{Haemodynamic impact of stent implantation for lateral tunnel Fontan
   stenosis: a patient-specific computational assessment}},
Journal = {{CARDIOLOGY IN THE YOUNG}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{116-126}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The physiological importance of the lateral tunnel stenosis
   in the Fontan pathway for children with single ventricle physiology can
   be difficult to determine. The impact of the stenosis and stent
   implantation on total cavopulmonary connection resistance has not been
   characteriszed, and there are no clear guidelines for intervention.
   Methods and results: A computational framework for haemodynamic
   assessment of stent implantation in patients with lateral tunnel
   stenosis was developed. Cardiac magnetic resonances images were
   reconstructed to obtain total cavopulmonary connection anatomies before
   stent implantation. Stents with 2- mm diameter increments were virtually
   implanted in each patient to understand the impact of stent diameter.
   Numerical simulations were performed in all geometries with patient-
   specific flow rates. Exercise conditions were simulated by doubling and
   tripling the lateral tunnel flow rate. The resulting total cavopulmonary
   connection vascular resistances were computed. A total of six patients (
   age: 14.4 +/- 3.1 years) with lateral tunnel stenosis were included for
   preliminary analysis. The mean baseline resistance was 1.54 +/- 1.08WU
   center dot m(2) and dependent on the stenosis diameter. It was further
   exacerbated during exercise. It was observed that utilising a stent with
   a larger diameter lowered the resistance, but the resistance reduction
   diminished at larger diameters. Conclusions: Using a computational
   framework to assess the severity of lateral tunnel stenosis and the
   haemodynamic impact of stent implantation, it was observed that stenosis
   in the lateral tunnel pathway was associated with higher total
   cavopulmonary connection resistance than unobstructed pathways, which
   was exacerbated during exercise. Stent implantation could reduce the
   resistance, but the improvement was specific to the minimum diameter.}},

   to prepare promising Al2O3@PI-BT composite. The results indicated that
   the resultant composites possessed high Young's modulus of 4.06 GPa, low
   dielectric constant (338-3.50, 100 kHz) and dielectric loss
   (0.0102-0.0107, 100 kHz). The Al2O3@PI hybrid film was also conductive
   to improve thermal stability (T-d5\% up to 371 degrees C), in-plane
   thermal conductivity (increased by 295\% compared to that of the pure BT
   resin). Furthermore, the Al2O3@PI-BT composite were employed to
   fabricate a printed circuit substrate, on which a frequency
   ``flasher{''} circuit and electrical components worked well. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Although provisions available in current design codes that take account
   of the presence of anchor plates, the existing provisions take no

   panel. Twenty-seven specimens were tested to investigate the effects of
   anchor plate width and thickness. The test results show that concrete
   breakout strength is considerably improved with increased anchor plate
   size, with the rate of improvement diminishing in very large anchor
   plates. A simplified analytical model was proposed to determine the
   optimal width and thickness of anchor plates. The predicted optimal
   values were validated with the test results; the proposed analytical

Abstract = {{In recent years, multimedia retrieval has sparked much research interest
   in the multimedia, pattern recognition, and data mining communities.
   Although some attempts have been made along this direction, performing
   fast multimodal search at very large scale still remains a major
   challenge in the area. While hashing-based methods have recently
   achieved promising successes in speeding-up large-scale similarity
   search, most existing methods are only designed for uni-modal data,
   making them unsuitable for multimodal multimedia retrieval. In this
   paper, we propose a new hashing-based method for fast multimodal
   multimedia retrieval. The method is based on spectral analysis of the
   correlation matrix of different modalities. We also develop an efficient
   algorithm that learns some parameters from the data distribution for
   obtaining the binary codes. We empirically compare our method with some
   state-of-the-art methods on two real-world multimedia data sets.}},

Title = {{Simulation-Based Gradient-Descent Optimization of Modular Multilevel

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{102-112}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{One of the main technical challenges associated with the modular
   multilevel converter (MMC) for any application is the optimal control of
   its states. Optimal control of the MMC requires determination of the
   following: 1) an accurate MMC model, 2) the MMC states to be controlled
   and their corresponding reference trajectories, and 3) an appropriate
   controller type/form and its parameters. The aforementioned tasks lead
   to the formulation of a multistate control optimization problem, which
   is tackled in this paper. This paper enhances the accuracy of the
   existing MMC state-space model by including the following: 1) a
   piecewise affine insulated-gate bipolar transistor/diode model and 2)
   the impact of dead time. This paper also proposes a simulation-based
   gradient-descent optimization algorithm (cosimulation) to optimize the
   controller gains, given the controller type/form and the reference state
   trajectory. The theoretical proofs of the gradients required in the
   optimization algorithm are also provided. The aforementioned
   optimization algorithm is applied to a variable-frequency MMC-based
   drive system. Experimental results on a scaled-down prototype and
   simulation results on a real-world application are provided to validate
   the accuracy of the proposed MMC model and to show the effectiveness of
   the proposed optimization algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Terrorist attacks on infrastructures are serious incidents in many
   countries. Measures to prevent terrorist attacks and minimize the damage
   are critical in the design of infrastructures. This paper develops an
   Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based risk assessment model to identify
   the key components of the overpass bridge in terrorist attacks, and
   prioritizes a variety of possible attack means with multiple criteria.
   The AHP risk assessment model can be used to not only set the priority
   of protected components, but also to allocate resources to the most
   critical protecting methods within a limited budget. An interchange
   overpass bridge in Beijing, China is analysed to validate the model. The
   results show that the method is suitable for the optimal resource
   allocation in the process of the overpass bridge anti-terrorism design,
   the formulation of a defence strategy and the protection resource
   allocation scheme for the overpass bridge against a terrorist attack.
   The method can also be used for dynamic allocating the resources for the
   overpass bridge under the early warning of terrorist attacks.}},

Abstract = {{While functional connectivity has typically been calculated over the
   entire length of the scan (5-10 min), interest has been growing in
   dynamic analysis methods that can detect changes in connectivity on the
   order of cognitive processes (seconds). Previous work with sliding
   window correlation has shown that changes in functional connectivity can
   be observed on these time scales in the awake human and in anesthetized
   animals. This exciting advance creates a need for improved approaches to
   characterize dynamic functional networks in the brain. Previous studies
   were performed using sliding window analysis on regions of interest
   defined based on anatomy or obtained from traditional steady-state
   analysis methods. The parcellation of the brain may therefore be
   suboptimal, and the characteristics of the time-varying connectivity
   between regions are dependent upon the length of the sliding window
   chosen. This manuscript describes an algorithm based on wavelet
   decomposition that allows data-driven clustering of voxels into
   functional regions based on temporal and spectral properties. Previous
   work has shown that different networks have characteristic frequency
   fingerprints, and the use of wavelets ensures that both the frequency
   and the timing of the BOLD fluctuations are considered during the
   clustering process. The method was applied to resting state data
   acquired from anesthetized rats, and the resulting clusters agreed well
   with known anatomical areas. Clusters were highly reproducible across
   subjects. Wavelet cross-correlation values between clusters from a
   single scan were significantly higher than the values from randomly
   matched clusters that shared no temporal information, indicating that
   wavelet-based analysis is sensitive to the relationship between areas.

Abstract = {{This article and the companion paper use computational systems modeling
   to decipher the complex coordination of regulatory signals controlling

   this first article, the development of a comprehensive kinetic dynamic

   of concentration trends in key glycolytic metabolites and cofactors. The
   model structure and parameter values are identified with a customized
   optimization strategy that uses as its core the method of dynamic flux
   estimation. For the first time, a dynamic model with a single parameter
   set fits all available glycolytic time course data under anaerobic
   operation. The model captures observations that had not been addressed
   so far and suggests the existence of regulatory effects that had been
   observed in other species, but not in L. lactis. The companion paper
   uses this model to analyze details of the dynamic control of glycolysis

Abstract = {{The dairy bacterium Lactococcus lactis has to master a complicated task.
   It must control its essentially linear glycolytic pathway in such a
   fashion that, when the substrate, glucose, runs out, it retains enough
   phosphoenolpyruvate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to be able to restart
   glycolysis as soon as new glucose becomes available. Although glycolysis
   is arguably the best-studied metabolic pathway, its details in L. lactis
   are still unclear, and it is, in particular, not understood how the
   bacterium manages the stop- and-start task. The primary purpose of this
   paper and its companion is a clarification of some of the details of the
   governing regulatory strategies with which L. lactis manages to retain
   the necessary metabolites for the restart of glycolysis after periods of
   starvation. The paper furthermore discusses how the bacterium changes
   these strategies when it is subjected to aerobic rather than anaerobic
   conditions.}},

   equation of motion for constrained mechanical systems with holonomic or

   linearization or approximations comes from a different, though closely
   allied, field, namely analytical dynamics. The control torques required
   to control the mobile robot so that it precisely satisfies the
   trajectory requirements which are represented by an arbitrary
   (sufficiently smooth) function of time are obtained explicitly and in
   closed form by solving Udwadia-Kalaba equation. Numerical simulations
   are performed to show the simplicity, efficacy and accuracy of this
   closed-form method.}},

Abstract = {{In order to reduce the wear rate of C/C-SiC brake composites at low
   brake speed, the C/C-SiC composites with Cu alloy modification were
   fabricated by simultaneous infiltration of molten Si and Cu. The
   tribological characteristics of C/C-SiC composites mated with self and
   steel counterparts, respectively, were investigated. The results
   indicated that the C/C-SiC composites were composed of C, SiC, Si, Cu3Si
   and Cu. The degree of graphitization of carbon matrix (pyrocarbon) in
   C/C-SiC was 0.642, and the calculated overall hardness of C/C-SiC was
   1441.6. The C/C-SiC brake composites show stable coefficient of friction
   (COF) and low wear rate under low brake speed for the matrix
   modification of Cu alloy. The COF of self-mated C/C-SiC and C/C-SiC
   mated with steel counterpart under the brake speed of 1500 r/min were
   0.17 and 0.31, respectively. The corresponding wear rates were 1.18 m
   side(-1) cycle(-1) and 0.04 m side cycle(-1) respectively. Due to the
   temperature of friction surface increased constantly, the Cu reacted
   with Si entirely and formed Cu3Si. Therefore, the Cu alloy in favor of
   diminishing the hardness of C/C-SiC during the brake process. The
   typical brake curves of C/C-SiC composites with Cu alloy modification
   were in the shape of horse saddle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Existing research in vibration-based energy harvesting has focused
   mostly on the harvesting of deterministic or stochastic vibrational
   energy available at a fixed position in space. Such an approach is
   convenient for designing and employing linear and non-linear
   vibration-based energy harvesters, such as base-excited cantilevers with
   piezoelectric laminates. This work presents a mathematical framework for
   the harvesting of one-dimensional bending waves propagating in infinite
   and semi-infinite beams as an alternative. For this purpose, the fully
   coupled electroelastic problem with piezoelectric patches bonded to a
   long slender beam is solved and conversion of incident wave energy into
   usable electricity while minimizing the traveling waves reflected and
   transmitted from the harvester domain is analyzed. The analysis shows
   that the efficiency of power transfer from elastic waves can be
   significantly improved beyond the typical wavelength matching in terms
   of both efficiency and bandwidth by resistive-inductive loading. It is
   also shown that enhancements to efficiency can be obtained by localized
   obstacles in mechanical domain, and fully anechoic boundary conditions
   can be obtained on finite beams by resistive-inductive impedance
   matching. These enhancement methods are most effective and practical
   when piezoelectric patch lengths and obstacle to patch distances are
   similar to> lambda/4, where evanescent fields become insignificant,
   while the model can readily accommodate the presence of evanescent waves
   for arbitrary patch lengths. The validity and application of the
   proposed methods are demonstrated with experimental case studies using a
   long slender beam. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Peridynamics is a non-local continuum mechanics formulation that can
   handle spatial discontinuities as the governing equations are
   integro-differential equations which do not involve gradients such as
   strains and deformation rates. This paper employs bond-based
   peridynamics. Cellular Automata is a local computational method which,
   in its rectangular variant on interior domains, is mathematically
   equivalent to the central difference finite difference method. However,
   cellular automata does not require the derivation of the governing
   partial differential equations and provides for common boundary
   conditions based on physical reasoning. Both methodologies are used to
   solve a half-space subjected to a normal load, known as Lamb's Problem.
   The results are compared with theoretical solution from classical
   elasticity and experimental results. This paper is used to validate our

Abstract = {{Heteroatoms doping provides a promising strategy for improving the
   energy density of supercapacitors based on the carbon electrodes. In
   this paper, we present a N and S dual doped ordered mesoporous carbon
   with ultrahigh doping level using dimethylglyoxime as pristine
   precursor. The N doping content of the reported materials varies from
   6.6 to 15.6 at.\% dependent on the carbonization temperature, and the S
   doping content varies from 0.46 to 1.01 at.\%. Due to the ultrahigh
   heteroatoms doping content, the reported materials exhibit pronounced
   pseudo-capacitance. Meanwhile, the reported materials exhibit high
   surface areas (640-869 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (0.71-1.08 cm(2)
   g(-1)) and ordered pore structure. The outstanding textual properties
   endow the reported materials excellent electrical double-layer
   capacitance (EDLC). By effectively combining the pseudo-capacitance with
   EDLC, the reported materials exhibit a surprising energy storage/relax
   capacity with the highest specific capacitance of 565 F g(-1), which
   value is 3.3 times higher than that of pristine CMK-3, and can compete

Abstract = {{Given a large graph, like a computer communication network, which k
   nodes should we immunize (or monitor, or remove), to make it as robust
   as possible against a computer virus attack? This problem, referred to
   as the node immunization problem, is the core building block in many
   high-impact applications, ranging from public health, cybersecurity to
   viral marketing. A central component in node immunization is to find the
   best k bridges of a given graph. In this setting, we typically want to
   determine the relative importance of a node (or a set of nodes) within
   the graph, for example, how valuable (as a bridge) a person or a group
   of persons is in a social network. First of all, we propose a novel
   `bridging' score Delta lambda, inspired by immunology, and we show that
   its results agree with intuition for several realistic settings. Since
   the straightforward way to compute Delta lambda is computationally
   intractable, we then focus on the computational issues and propose a
   surprisingly efficient way (Odnk(2)+m) to estimate it. Experimental
   results on real graphs show that (1) the proposed `bridging' score gives
   mining results consistent with intuition; and (2) the proposed fast
   solution is up to seven orders of magnitude faster than straightforward
   alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic nature and limited work space of roadway work zones
   contribute to dangerous working environments for construction workers.
   This environment can result in hazardous proximity situations because
   pedestrian workers are required to operate in close proximity to heavy
   construction equipment. A total of 609 work zone personnel fatalities
   were reported in 2012. Previous analysis of work zone fatality data
   found that the majority of the pedestrian worker and mobile object
   struck-by fatalities resulted when pedestrian workers were struck by
   construction equipment. These statistics indicate that current safety
   practices for pedestrian workers and equipment operators are inadequate.
   The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a proximity
   detection and alert system using Bluetooth sensing technology. The scope
   included hazardous proximity situations between pedestrian workers and
   construction equipment in roadway work zones at grade. Evaluation
   metrics were implemented to assess the tested proximity sensing systems
   including the cost, time and ease of calibration, required hardware,
   system capabilities, and many others. Commercially available radio
   frequency identification (RFID) and magnetic field proximity sensing
   systems were also evaluated to provide a basis for comparison. Various
   interaction scenarios between pedestrian workers and construction
   equipment were used in the evaluation of the system. The performance
   evaluation based on the statistical results showed that all the tested
   systems were considered reliable with minimal false alarm rates.
   However, the magnetic system showed a significant drop in its coverage
   range, while still providing reliable coverage measures, with a set of
   tests that were more dynamic than other sets of tests. The created
   Bluetooth system provided the highest level of simplicity with its
   minimized infrastructure, ease of calibration, and ease of installation.
   In sum, experimental results demonstrate that the created proximity
   detection and alert system (1) requires minimal infrastructure; (2)
   provides adequate alerts to equipment operators and pedestrian workers;
   and (3) provides, through an alert, an additional layer of hazard
   avoidance in real time during hazardous-proximity situations in roadway
   work zones. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Dense Jet Discharges in Shallow Water}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Extensive Experiments on inclined dense jets typical of brine discharges
   into shallow water are reported. The experiments were conducted with
   nozzles oriented at 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees to the
   horizontal and the spatial variations of tracer concentrations were
   measured by three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence (3DLIF). Three
   flow regimes were identified: deep water, surface contact, and shallow
   water. The regimes depend on the value of dF/H, where d is the nozzle
   diameter, F the jet densimetric Froude number, and H the water depth;
   criteria were presented for the transitions between them. Flow images
   revealed complex three-dimensional interactions with the free surface,
   especially for steep nozzle angles in shallow water. Dilutions at
   critical points and their locations were measured. For deep water, all
   results followed those previously reported for fully submerged jets. As
   the depth decreases (or dF/H increases) to the surface contact regime,
   dilutions begin to decrease. Tracer concentration profiles are truncated
   at the water surface and in shallow water resemble half-Gaussian
   profiles similar to those of wall jets. The jets can cling to the water
   surface, although the locations of the bottom impact point and
   near-field length are not significantly affected by the water surface.
   In deep water and surface contact regimes, the impact point and
   near-field dilutions are highest for 60 degrees nozzles. As the depth
   decreases further, however, the dilutions for the three nozzle angles
   become approximately equal, until, for shallow water, the 30
   degrees-nozzle gives slightly higher dilution. The 30 degrees-nozzle may
   be preferable for this case because there is less surface interaction
   and, therefore, less visual impact on the water surface. Previous
   recommendations that dense jets be submerged so that the rise height to
   the jet's upper boundary be less than 75\% of the water depth to avoid
   surface effects appear to be overly conservative and the present results
   suggest that the rise can be as much as 90\% of the water depth for all
   angles with no deleterious effect on dilution. (C) 2015 American Society

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{The flipped classroom is becoming increasingly popular at universities
   because of its perceived benefits in promoting active learning and
   decreasing educational costs. Studies have found positive benefits
   associated with flipped classrooms; however, many have failed to control
   for confounding factors. Examples of confounding factors include
   comparing courses taught by different instructors or across courses
   taught in different semesters using different quizzes. The objective of
   this paper is to compare the traditional and flipped classrooms in an
   undergraduate civil engineering course while controlling for potential
   confounding factors. The quasi-experimental study incorporates students'
   online behaviors, in-class performance, office hour attendance, and
   responses to both attitudinal and behavioral questions to assess student
   opinions and learning outcomes. It was found that student performance on
   quizzes was not significantly different across the traditional and
   flipped classrooms. A key shortcoming noted with the flipped classroom
   was students' inability to ask questions during lectures. Students in
   flipped classrooms were more likely to attend office hours compared to
   traditional classroom students, but the difference was not statistically
   significant. Future research should explore whether students' inability
   to ask questions when the material is presented in flipped classrooms
   affects learning outcomes.(C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-59}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fire ants link their bodies to form aggregations; these can adopt a
   variety of structures(1-4), they can drip(2) and spread(4), or withstand
   applied loads(5,6). Here, by using oscillatory rheology, we show that
   fire ant aggregations are viscoelastic. We find that, at the lowest ant
   densities probed and in the linear regime, the elastic and viscous
   moduli are essentially identical over the spanned frequency range, which
   highlights the absence of a dominant mode of structural relaxation(7).
   As ant density increases, the elastic modulus rises, which we interpret
   by alluding to ant crowding and subsequent jamming. When deformed beyond
   the linear regime, the aggregation flows, exhibiting shear-thinning
   behaviour with a stress load that is comparable to the maximum load the
   aggregation can withstand before individual ants are torn apart. Our
   findings illustrate the rich, collective mechanical behaviour that can
   arise in aggregations of active, interacting building blocks.}},

Abstract = {{Material internal structure (generally referred as microstructure) is
   known to play an important role in controlling the
   properties/performance characteristics of the material. Most commonly
   employed methods of microstructure characterization result in 2-D (two
   dimensional) sampling of the inherently 3-D microstructure. This is
   because the available methods of 3-D characterization incur several
   orders of magnitude larger time and effort compared to the
   well-established and validated 2-D characterization protocols. However,
   if one accepts the fundamental hypothesis that the microstructure in a
   hierarchical material system need only be quantified rigorously in a
   statistical framework for establishing the desired correlations with
   bulk (effective) properties of the material, then it raises the
   potential of whether or not one can build statistically equivalent 3-D
   microstructures from the low-cost 2-D exemplars collected from oblique
   (non-parallel) sections on the sample. This paper develops and discusses
   a suitable framework to explore such an approach, and demonstrates its
   viability and utility through selected case studies. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{A simple MEMS/NEMS platform facilitates the modeling of the interaction
   of nanostructure directing metal oxide island sites with several gas
   phase analytes. A ``response matrix{''} created for the nanostructured
   metal oxides facilitates the modeling process. Sensitive conductometric
   sensors operating at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, are
   forgiving, and do not require film based technology or lithography for
   their construction. Their responses are simulated using a combination
   diffusion/adsorption-based model where a new adsorption isotherm is
   derived on the basis of the Fermi distribution function. We show that
   diffusion dominates the conductometric response and model this process
   with the aid of the relative sensitivities determined previously for the
   metal oxides. Not only the direct response but also the derivatives of
   this response are used to evaluate the modeling of Fickian diffusion.
   The first derivative, as it is found to be linear in concentration,
   allows a quick evaluation of a rapid sensor response. The spectral
   simulations are refined to include the adsorption effects of the analyte
   gas and evaluate subsequent non-linear interface sensitivities. A new
   Fermi energy distribution-based response isotherm, based on first
   principles, is compared to a diversity of well-known empirical isotherms
   and found to be superior for the modeling of the sensor response. A
   comprehensive model including not only this response but also its
   derivative and its log-log plot are demonstrated. This modeling is
   exemplified for the analytes NH3 and NO. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Fatigue crack initiation in the high cycle fatigue regime is strongly
   influenced by microstructural features. Research efforts have usually
   focused on predicting fatigue resistance against crack incubation
   without considering the early fatigue crack growth after encountering
   the first grain boundary. However, a significant fraction of the
   variability of the total fatigue life can be attributed to growth of
   small cracks as they encounter the first few grain boundaries, rather
   than crack formation within the first grain. This paper builds on the
   framework previously developed by the authors to assess
   microstructure-sensitive small fatigue crack formation and early growth
   under complex loading conditions. The scheme employs finite element
   simulations that explicitly render grains and crystallographic
   directions along with simulation of microstructurally small fatigue
   crack growth from grain to grain. The methodology employs a crystal
   plasticity algorithm in ABAQUS that was previously calibrated to study
   fatigue crack initiation in RR1000 Ni-base superalloy. This work present
   simulations with non-zero applied mean strains and geometric
   discontinuities that were not previously considered for calibration.
   Results exhibit trends similar to those found in experiments for
   multiple metallic materials, conveying a consistent physical description

Abstract = {{Graphene nanosheets are facilely prepared by electrochemical exfoliation
   of graphite in sodium tungstate aqueous solution. Through a
   filtration-transfer procedure and followed by heat treatment, the
   graphene nanosheets are deposited on the polyethylene terephthalate
   substrate to form electrothermal films. The graphene electrothermal
   films exhibit low square resistance of 159 Omega/sq, high in-plane
   thermal conductivity of 658 W/m/K, and excellent heat propagation with
   uniform temperature distribution. The steady-state temperature of the
   films increases from 32 to 139 A degrees C as the applied voltage
   increases from 5 to 30 V. The electrothermal response of the graphene
   films is as fast as < 20 s. The graphene film heaters also display good
   flexibility. Even after bending 100 times, the graphene film heaters
   still exhibit almost the same electrothermal performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the application of the geometric multiscale finite
   element method for the analysis of wave propagation in heterogeneous
   periodic solids. The proposed scheme exploits multi-node elements to
   describe the microstructure through a local, auxiliary mesh that
   resolves the fine scale features, and that is used to numerically
   compute a set of interpolation functions employed for elements
   formulations at the global level. The method is applied for the analysis
   of the dispersion properties of, and transient wave propagation in
   domains featuring periodicity in two dimensions. Band diagram
   calculations, wave velocities and time domain computations are conducted
   on solids discretized using two-dimensional and three-dimensional
   multiscale finite element meshes. Results for assemblies with periodic
   inclusions, phononic stubbed plates and structural lattices illustrate
   the effectiveness of the method. Accurate predictions of dispersion
   relations, wave modes and time domain simulations are obtained with
   significant reductions in model size. The presented examples also
   illustrate some of the interesting wave characteristics of the
   considered class of periodic structures, which include wave
   directionality and frequency bandgaps. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose a unified approach to automatic foreign accent recognition.
   It takes advantage of recent technology advances in both linguistics and
   acoustics based modeling techniques in automatic speech recognition
   (ASR) while overcoming the issue of a lack of a large set of transcribed
   data often required in designing state-of-the-art ASR systems. The key
   idea lies in defining a common set of fundamental units
   ``universally{''} across all spoken accents such that any given spoken
   utterance can be transcribed with this set of ``accent-universal{''}
   units. In this study, we adopt a set of units describing manner and
   place of articulation as speech attributes. These units exist in most
   spoken languages and they can be reliably modeled and extracted to
   represent foreign accent cues. We also propose an i-vector
   representation strategy to model the feature streams formed by
   concatenating these units. Testing on both the Finnish national foreign
   language certificate (FSD) corpus and the English NIST 2008 SRE corpus,
   the experimental results with the proposed approach demonstrate a
   significant system performance improvement with p-value 0.05 over those
   with the conventional spectrum-based techniques. We observed up to a
   15\% relative error reduction over the already very strong i-vector
   accented recognition system when only manner information is used.
   Additional improvement is obtained by adding place of articulation clues
   along with context information. Furthermore, diagnostic information
   provided by the proposed approach can be useful to the designers to
   further enhance the system performance.}},

Abstract = {{Phase change in hydrocarbons is of interest to the petroleum, refining,
   and chemical processing industry, as well as in HVAC and in organic
   Rankine power cycles. An experimental investigation of flow regimes and
   void fractions during condensation of propane flowing through smooth
   horizontal tubes with internal diameters of 7.0 mm and 15.0 mm was
   conducted. Measurements were made over mass fluxes ranging from 75 to
   450 kg m(-2) s(-1), operating pressures ranging from 952 to 1218 kPa,
   and nominal vapor qualities ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. Results from this
   experimental study are compared with predictions from correlations in
   the literature, and agreement and differences are interpreted and
   discussed. Appropriate flow regime transition criteria between the wavy
   and annular flow regimes are highlighted. Detailed analyses of the video
   frames are also used to develop a new multi-regime void fraction model
   that uses the drift flux model framework. The model provides improved
   agreement with the experimental results when compared to correlations
   from the literature, and predicts the trends with mass flux, tube
   diameter and pressure well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) is considered a promising electrolyte for
   intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) due to its
   high ionic conductivity and stability under fuel cell operating
   conditions. Here we report our findings in investigating the feasibility
   of using a high velocity oxygen fuel flame (HVOF) spraying process for
   cost-effective fabrication of dense LSGM electrolyte membranes. The
   flame and in-flight particle behavior were simulated numerically to
   optimize the microstructure and phase compositions of the LSGM deposits.
   The measured gas leakage rate of an LSGM deposit is similar to 7 x
   10(-7) cm(4)gf(-1) s(-1). The single cell assembled with 50-55 mu m
   HVOF-sprayed LSGM electrolyte shows open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.08 V
   at 800 degrees C, suggesting that the as-sprayed LSGM deposit is dense
   enough for direct application as SOFC electrolyte. At 800 degrees C, the
   ionic conductivity of the sprayed LSGM deposit is similar to 0.04 S
   cm(-1), indicating that the HVOF spraying is a promising process for
   low-temperature fabrication of dense LSGM electrolyte membranes for
   IT-SOFCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on a thin
   La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte membrane supported by a
   nickel-based anode often suffers from undesirable reaction/diffusion
   between the Ni anode and the LSGM during high-temperature co-firing. In
   this study, a high performance intermediate-temperature SOFC is
   fabricated by depositing thin LSGM electrolyte membranes on a LSGM
   backbone of unique architecture coated with nano-sized Ni and
   Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC) particles via a combination of freeze-drying
   tape-casting, slurry drop-coating, and solution infiltration. The
   thickness of the dense LSGM electrolyte membranes is similar to 30 mu m
   while the undesirable reaction/diffusion between Ni and LSGM are
   effectively hindered because of the relatively low firing temperature,
   as confirmed by XRD analysis. Single cells show peak power densities of
   1.61 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and 0.52W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C using 3
   vol\% humidified H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The cell

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to reveal the mechanism of effective
   and inexpensive sorbent MnCl2 for elemental mercury (Hg-0) removal from
   the flue gas. The adsorption behavior of Hg-0 on MnCl2 (11 0) surface
   was investigated theoretically using Density Functional Theory. The
   geometry optimization and adsorption energy of Hg-0 on MnCl2 surface
   were calculated by generalized gradient approximation with Perdew Burke
   Emzerh functional (GGA/PBE) and DNP basis. Results showed that He
   adsorption on MnCl2 (1 1 0) surface is chemisorption with adsorption
   energy of -156.620 kJ/mol. According to Hirshfeld charge analysis, Hg-0
   has active interaction with Cl atoms (CI-12, CI-32, CI-44) and Mn-40
   atom on MnCl2 (110) surface. The partial density of states (PDOS)
   analysis further reveals that p- and d-orbitals of Cl atoms strongly
   hybridize with s- and d-orbitals of Hg-0 atom. The d-orbital of Mn-40
   also has essential interaction with Hg-0 atom. Both of them contribute
   to the stable adsorption system of Hg-0 MnCl2. The equilibrium constant
   decreases with the increase of temperature, which coincides with data
   for exothermic adsorption system. For the first time, this study
   investigated the mechanism of Hg-0 adsorption on metal chloride surface
   using DFT method. It provides a significance theoretical support for
   metal chloride application in Hg-0 adsorption and removal. The results
   obtained in this research are in good agreement with previous
   experiment. This method can be used to reveal Hg-0 capture mechanism in
   some complex systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Fe, Ni, and Fe/Ni nanoparticles were successfully
   incorporated in commercial polystyrene cation exchange resin, D072, to
   form Fe-D072, Ni-D072, and Fe/Ni-D072 composites. The resultant
   composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy
   dispersive spectrometer and X-ray diffraction. For the first time, the
   resultant composites were used to dechlorinate trichloroethylene (TCE),
   the target pollutant, in aqueous solution. The effects of initial
   concentration of TCE and solution pH on TCE removal efficiencies by
   Fe/Ni-D072 were investigated. The stability and durability of Fe/Ni-D072
   were also examined. Results showed that Fe/Ni-D072 with 4\% wt of Ni/Fe
   loading (mass ratio: Ni:Fe = 20:80) possesses superior dechlorination
   performance compared with TCE to Fe-D072 and Ni-D072. The freshly
   prepared Fe/Ni-D072 exhibited high reactivity during the dechlorination
   process of TCE. However, reactivity decreased with increased number of
   cycles. The leaching of Fe and Ni ions from Fe/Ni-D072 were
   approximately 0.2 ppm and less than 0.1 ppm, respectively, which are
   below the maximum acceptable level of Fe and Ni in water (0.3 mg/L for
   Fe and 0.1 mg/L for Ni) as suggested by the US Environment Protection
   Agency (EPA). The study confirmed that Fe/Ni-D072 is a potential
   catalyst to reduce environmental pollutants containing carbon halogen
   bonds such as TCE. (C) O 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As Fe(II)-rich minerals, Fe(II)/Fe(III) hydroxides were intensively
   investigated in the sequestration of aqueous Cr(VI). Results showed that
   the content of Cr(VI) sequestrated ({[}Cr(VI)](se)) was in proportional
   to the absolute content of structural Fe(II) ( Fe(II)). Molecular ratios
   of {[}Fe(II)](co)(consumed Fe(II))/{[}Cr (VI)](se) close to 3:1, the
   theoretical ratio, indicated high reactivity of structural Fe(II), which
   could also be confirmed by the fact that 278 mg Cr(VI)/g Fe(II) was
   achieved. In other words, negligible inhibitory effect was deduced in
   the case of surface Cr(III)-solids, which was responsible for limited
   reactivity of previous reported Fe(II)-contained minerals. Large surface
   area induced adsorption, accompanied by simultaneous reduction, was
   supposed to govern the rapid reaction within the initial 10 min.
   Reaction within 10-20 min well fit a pseudo-first-order model,
   demonstrating high electron transfer efficiency from inner Fe(II) to
   adsorbed/aqueous Cr(VI), though surface Cr(III)-solids were formed.
   Cr(III)-solids containing end solid products were found to be goethite,
   CrOOH and Cr(OH)3, which was benefit to establish the interfacial
   reduction-precipitation mechanism of Cr(VI) sequestration. The negative
   effect of OH- was deduced on Fe(II) availability in the cases of
   {[}Fe(II)]/{[}OH-] ratios higher or lower than 1:1. Simultaneous PO43-
   addition caused vivianite generation, resulting Fe(II) reactivity
   decrease. This investigation gave well implication that  Fe(II) could be
   applied and regulated in the reduction precipitation of Cr(VI) and
   possible other heavy metal ions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   aerogel}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{283}},
Pages = {{1059-1068}},

Abstract = {{Amine hybrid silsesquioxane aerogel (AHSA) was synthesized through a
   single-step sol-gel process followed by supercritical drying. CO2
   adsorption performances of highly porous AHSA in 1\% CO2 were
   investigated. 50 degrees C is preferred to perform the CO2 capture of
   AHSA to achieve a CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.04 mmol/g (dry) or 3.84
   mmol/g (humid) under given conditions. A rise in adsorption gas flow
   rate from 300 to 700 ml/min results in the decrease of CO2 adsorption
   capacity from 3.04 to 2.42 mmol/g. The CO2 adsorption rate is mainly
   affected by the gas flow rate, while the effect of temperature can be
   ignored. Different with the adsorption performance, the CO2 desorption
   kinetics of AHSA is mainly affected by the temperature, the effect of
   gas flow rate is indifferent. Water favors the CO2 capture capability of
   AHSA, however, it is bad for the CO2 adsorption and desorption kinetics.
   The CO2 adsorption capacities of AHSA in 1\% CO2 are much higher than
   those of other amine based porous adsorbents obtained with a 1\% or even
   higher CO2 gas mixture. Also, AHSA has very short adsorption half time
   (22-55 s) and low desorption temperature of 80 degrees C, much lower
   than those of other amine-based adsorbents. The resulting adsorbent is
   dynamic and possesses excellent regenerability for low-concentration CO2
   capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work we present a molecular dynamics study of a symmetrically
   strained SiGe superlattice subjected to compression. We measure the
   velocity of a dislocation nucleated at a step in the superlattice on a
   slip system that cuts across the interfaces, and compare it with that in
   single crystal Si and Ge for the same geometry. Simulation results of
   this work show that the phase interfaces in the short-period SiGe
   superlattice are free of misfit dislocations and that the average
   dislocation velocity in the SiGe superlattice sample is about two orders
   of magnitude lower than that in the Si and Ge single crystals for the
   same geometry and size. The effect of the coherent phase interfaces on
   the average dislocation velocity is quantified, and the underlying
   mechanism is identified. This work demonstrates that the coherency
   stress plays a dominant role on dislocation migration in coherent SiGe
   superlattices. It shows that a phase interface can impede or assist the
   migration of a dislocation depending on whether the sign of the stress
   field along the interface opposes or reinforces that of the dislocation
   core. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method for the 3D reconstruction of a microstructure from
   limited statistical information provided by 2D cross sections is
   developed. In the proposed approach, first full-set statistical
   information (two-point correlation functions) are extracted from 2D
   cross sections, and then an approximate 3D microstructure is realized
   based on them. The proposed method relies mainly on conditional
   probability theorem to establish explicit functional forms between
   two-point correlation functions extracted from 2D cross sections and
   full-set 3D statistics. For 3D realization, a novel phase-recovery
   algorithm is developed that captures prominent attributions of the
   microstructure. The salient feature of the proposed realization scheme
   is the ability to fully reconstruct 3D microstructures from statistical
   information provided by just one cross section for isotropic
   microstructures and two perpendicular cross sections for anisotropic
   ones. A number of illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the
   accuracy and the versatility of the proposed scheme. The application of
   the method for the 3D realization of microstructure using an
   experimental dataset is demonstrated. Finally, the accuracy of the
   method in capturing and retaining essential features including volume
   fractions and characteristic attributions as well as the state of
   anisotropy and percolation of the phases is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   linearity of 0.9939, and was obtained within 13 sec, in glucose
   concentrations ranging up to 36 mM. The biosensor also exhibited a low
   detection limit of 50 mu M. We tested the sensor under PBS solution over
   a period of 6 days. Then we partially inserted the sensor into a rabbit,
   to monitor the interstitial glucose level. We then induced change of
   interstitial glucose concentration by oral glucose tolerance test.
   Although we expected the sensor to perform for more than 6 days, it
   performed for just 4 days as a sensor, due to bio fouling. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Approximately 1\% of children are born with a moderate to severe
   congenital heart defect, and half of them undergo one or more surgeries
   to fix it. SURGEM, a solid modeling environment, is used to improve
   surgical outcome by allowing the surgeon to design the geometry for
   several possible surgical options before the operation and to evaluate
   their relative merits using computational fluid simulation. We describe
   here the solid modeling and graphical user interface challenges that we
   have encountered while developing support for three surgeries: (1)
   repair of double-outlet right ventricle, which adds a graft wall within
   the cardiac chambers to split the solid model of the unique ventricle,
   (2) the Fontan procedure, which routes a graft tube to connect the
   inferior vena cava to the pulmonary arteries, and (3) stenosis repair,
   which adds a stent to expand a constricted artery. We describe several
   solutions that we have developed to address these challenges and to
   improve the performance, reliability, and usability of SURGEM for these
   tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Circulating Current Suppression of the Modular Multilevel Converter in a

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has attracted significant
   interest for medium-/high-power energy conversion applications due to
   its modularity, scalability, and excellent harmonic performance. One of
   the technical challenges associated with the operation of the MMC is the
   circulation of double-frequency harmonic currents within its phase legs.
   This paper proposes a circulating current control strategy in a
   double-frequency rotating reference frame, which, contrary to the
   existing solutions that are based on approximate/inaccurate models,
   relies on an experimentally identified nonparametric model of
   circulating currents to determine the coefficients of the controller.
   Minimizing the squared second norm of the error between the open-loop
   transfer function of the system and a desired one, the coefficients of
   the controller are determined. To guarantee the stability of the
   closed-loop system, the minimization problem is subjected to a few
   constraints. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed control
   strategy is confirmed, and its dynamic performance is compared with that
   of an existing solution by experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{A unique MEMS/NEMS approach is presented for the modeling of a detection
   platform for mixed gas interactions. Mixed gas analytes interact with
   nanostructured decorating metal oxide island sites supported on a
   microporous silicon substrate. The Inverse Hard/Soft acid/base (IHSAB)
   concept is used to assess a diversity of conductometric responses for
   mixed gas interactions as a function of these nanostructured metal
   oxides. The analyte conductometric responses are well represented using
   a combination diffusion/absorption-based model for multi-gas
   interactions where a newly developed response absorption isotherm, based
   on the Fermi distribution function is applied. A further coupling of
   this model with the IHSAB concept describes the considerations in
   modeling of multi-gas mixed analyte-interface, and analyte-analyte
   interactions. Taking into account the molecular electronic interaction
   of both the analytes with each other and an extrinsic semiconductor
   interface we demonstrate how the presence of one gas can enhance or
   diminish the reversible interaction of a second gas with the extrinsic
   semiconductor interface. These concepts demonstrate important
   considerations in the array-based formats for multi-gas sensing and its
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The refined similarity hypotheses of Kolmogorov, regarded as an
   important ingredient of intermittent turbulence, has been tested in the
   past using one-dimensional data and plausible surrogates of energy
   dissipation. We employ data from direct numerical simulations, at the
   microscale Reynolds number R-lambda similar to 650, on a periodic box of
   4096(3) grid points to test the hypotheses using three-dimensional
   averages. In particular, we study the small-scale properties of the
   stochastic variable V = Delta u(r)/(r epsilon(r))(1/3), where Delta u(r)
   is the longitudinal velocity increment and epsilon(r) is the dissipation
   rate averaged over a three-dimensional volume of linear size r. We show
   that V is universal in the inertial subrange. In the dissipation range,
   the statistics of V are shown to depend solely on a local Reynolds
   number.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive power control of doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) has
   been a heated topic in transient stability control of power systems in
   recent years. By using a new online supplementary learning control
   (OSLC) approach based on the theory of approximate dynamic programming
   (ADP), this paper develops an optimal and adaptive design method for the
   supplementary reactive power control of DFIGs to improve transient
   stability of power systems. To augment the reactive power command of the
   rotor-side converter (RSC), a supplementary controller is designed to
   reduce voltage sag at the common coupling point during a fault, and to
   mitigate active power oscillation of the wind farm after a fault. As a
   result, the transient stability of both DFIGs and the power system is
   enhanced. For the supplementary controller design, an action dependent
   cost function is introduced to make the OSLC model-free and completely
   data-driven. Furthermore, a least-squares based policy iteration
   algorithm is employed to train the supplementary controller with
   convergence and stability guarantee. By using such techniques, the
   supplementary reactive power controller can be trained directly from
   data measurements, and therefore, can adapt to system or external
   changes without an explicit offline system identification process.
   Simulations carried out in Power System Computer Aided Design/ Electro
   Magnetic Transient in DC System (PSCAD/EMTDC) show that the OSLC based
   supplementary reactive power controller can significantly improve the
   transient performance of the wind farm and enhance the transient
   stability of the power system after sever faults. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Wireless software-defined networks (W-SDNs) and network function
   virtualization (NFV) for 5G cellular systems: An overview and

Abstract = {{Cellular network technologies have evolved to support the
   ever-increasing wireless data traffic, which results from the
   rapidly-evolving Internet and widely-adopted cloud applications over
   wireless networks. However, hardware-based designs, which rely on closed
   and inflexible architectures of current cellular systems, make a typical
   10-year cycle for a new generation of wireless networks to be
   standardized and deployed. To overcome this limitation, the concept of
   software-defined networking (SON) has been proposed to efficiently
   create centralized network abstraction with the provisioning of
   programmability over the entire network. Moreover, the complementary
   concept of network function virtualization (NFV) has been further
   proposed to effectively separate the abstraction of functionalities from
   the hardware by decoupling the data forwarding plane from the control
   plane. These two concepts provide cellular networks with the needed
   flexibility to evolve and adapt according to the ever-changing network
   context and introduce wireless software-defined networks (W-SDNs) for 5G
   cellular systems. Thus, there is an urgent need to study the fundamental
   architectural principles underlying a new generation of software-defined
   cellular network as well as the enabling technologies that supports and
   manages such emerging architecture. In this paper, first, the
   state-of-the-art W-SDNs solutions along with their associated NFV
   techniques are surveyed. Then, the key differences among these W-SDN
   solutions as well as their limitations are highlighted. To counter those
   limitations, SoftAir, a new SON architecture for 5G cellular systems, is
   introduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and efficient predictions of hydrocarbon diffusivities in
   zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are challenging, due to the small
   pore size of materials such as ZIF-8 and the wide range of diffusion
   time scales of hydrocarbon molecules in ZIFs. Here we have
   computationally measured the hopping rates of 15 different molecules
   (kinetic diameters of 2.66-5.10 angstrom) in ZIF-8 via dynamically
   corrected transition state theory (dcTST). Umbrella sampling combined
   with the one-dimensional weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) was
   used to calculate the diffusion free energy barriers. Both the umbrella
   sampling and dynamical correction calculations included ZIF-8
   flexibility, which is found to be critical in accurately describing
   molecular diffusion in this material. Comparison of the computed
   diffusivities to extant experimental results shows remarkable agreement
   within an order of magnitude for all the molecules. The dcTST method was
   also applied to study the effect of hydrocarbon loadings. Self and
   transport diffusion coefficients of methane, ethane, ethylene, propane,
   propylene, n-butane, and 1-butene in ZIP-8 are reported over a
   temperature range of 0-150 degrees C and loadings from infinite dilution
   to liquid-like loadings.}},

   within Inner Cylindrical Pores of Carbon Nanotubes}},

Abstract = {{Lithium insertion into sulfur confined within 200 nm cylindrical inner
   pores of individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was monitored in situ in a
   transmission electron microscope (TEM). This electrochemical reaction
   was initiated at one end of the S-filled CNTs. The material expansion
   during lithiation was accommodated by the expansion into the remaining
   empty pore volume and no fracture of the CNT walls was detected. A sharp
   interface between the initial and lithiated S was observed. The reaction
   front was flat, oriented perpendicular to the confined S cylinder, and
   propagated along the cylinder length. Lithiation of S in the proximity
   of conductive carbon proceeded at the same rate as the one in the center
   of the pore, suggesting the presence of electron pathways at the Li2S/S
   interface. Density of states calculations further confirmed this
   hypothesis. In situ electron diffraction showed a direct phase
   transformation of S into nanocrystalline Li2S without detectable
   formation of any intermediates, such as polysulfides and LiS. These
   important insights may elucidate some of the reaction mechanisms and
   guide the improvements in the design of C-S nanocomposites for high
   specific energy Li-S batteries. The proposed use of conductive CNTs with
   tunable pore diameter as cylindrical reaction vessels for in situ TEM
   studies of electrochemical reactions proved to be highly advantageous
   and may help to resolve the ongoing problems in battery technology.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Water waves are increasingly regarded as a promising source for
   large-scale energy applications. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs)
   have been recognized as one of the most promising approaches for
   harvesting wave energy. This work examines a freestanding, fully
   enclosed TENG that encloses a rolling ball inside a rocking spherical
   shell. Through the optimization of materials and structural parameters,
   a spherical TENG of 6 cm in diameter actuated by water waves can provide
   a peak current of 1 A over a wide load range from a short-circuit
   condition to 10 G, with an instantaneous output power of up to 10 mW. A
   multielectrode arrangement is also studied to improve the output of the
   TENG under random wave motions from all directions. Moreover, at a
   frequency of 1.43 Hz, the wave-driven TENG can directly drive tens of
   LEDs and charge a series of supercapacitors to rated voltage within
   several hours. The stored energy can power an electronic thermometer for
   20 min. This rolling-structured TENG is extremely lightweight, has a
   simple structure, and is capable of rocking on or in water to harvest
   wave energy; it provides an innovative and effective approach toward
   large-scale blue energy harvesting of oceans and lakes.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the relationship between an enhancer DNA sequence and
   quantitative gene expression, thermodynamics-driven mathematical models
   of transcription are often employed. These ``sequence-to-expression''
   models can describe an incomplete or even incorrect set of regulatory
   relationships if the parameter space is not searched systematically.
   Here, we focus on an enhancer of the Drosophila gene ind and demonstrate
   how a systematic search of parameter space can reveal a more
   comprehensive picture of a gene's regulatory mechanisms, resolve
   outstanding ambiguities, and suggest testable hypotheses. We describe an
   approach that generates an ensemble of ind models; all of these models
   are technically acceptable solutions to the sequence-to-expression
   problem in light of wild-type data, and some represent mechanistically
   distinct hypotheses about the regulation of ind. This ensemble can be
   restricted to biologically plausible models using requirements gleaned
   from in vivo perturbation experiments. Biologically plausible models
   make unique predictions about how specific ind enhancer sequences affect
   ind expression; we validate these predictions in vivo through site
   mutagenesis in transgenic Drosophila embryos.}},

Abstract = {{High-boiling-point solvent additives, employed during the solution
   processing of active-layer formulations, impact the efficiency of bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells by influencing the
   morphological/topological features of the multicomponent thin film.
   Here, we aim at a better understanding of how these additives change the
   aggregation landscape in the casting solution prior to film deposition
   via a multiscale computational study of the aggregation phenomena of
   phenyl-C-61-butyric-acid methyl ester (PCBM) in various solutions. The
   energetic landscape of PCBM-solvent/solvent-additive intermolecular
   interactions is evaluated at the electronic-structure level through
   symmetry-adapted perturbation theory to determine the nature and
   strength of noncovalent forces important to aggregation. Molecular
   dynamics simulations highlight how the choice of solvent and solvent
   additives control the formation of molecular aggregates. Our results
   indicate that high-boiling point solvent additives change the effective
   interactions among the PCBM and casting-solvent molecules and alter
   equilibrium PCBM aggregate size in solution.}},

Abstract = {{We numerically analyze the rotation of a neutrally buoyant spheroid in a
   shear flow at small shear Reynolds number. Using direct numerical
   stability analysis of the coupled nonlinear particle-flow problem, we
   compute the linear stability of the log-rolling orbit at small shear
   Reynolds number Re-a. As Re-a -> 0 and as the box size of the system
   tends to infinity, we find good agreement between the numerical results
   and earlier analytical predictions valid to linear order in Re-a for the
   case of an unbounded shear. The numerical stability analysis indicates
   that there are substantial finite-size corrections to the analytical
   results obtained for the unbounded system. We also compare the
   analytical results to results of lattice Boltzmann simulations to
   analyze the stability of the tumbling orbit at shear Reynolds numbers of
   order unity. Theory for an unbounded system at infinitesimal shear
   Reynolds number predicts a bifurcation of the tumbling orbit at aspect
   ratio lambda(c) approximate to 0.137 below which tumbling is stable (as
   well as log rolling). The simulation results show a bifurcation line in
   the lambda-Re-a plane that reaches lambda approximate to 0.1275 at the
   smallest shear Reynolds number (Re-a = 1) at which we could simulate
   with the lattice Boltzmann code, in qualitative agreement with the
   analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{We recently demonstrated that position in visual space is represented by
   grid cells in the primate entorhinal cortex (EC), suggesting that visual
   exploration of complex scenes in primates may employ signaling
   mechanisms similar to those used during exploration of physical space
   via movement in rodents. Here, we describe a group of saccade direction
   (SD) cells that encode eye movement information in the monkey EC during
   free-viewing of complex images. Significant saccade direction encoding
   was found in 20\% of the cells recorded in the posterior EC. SD cells
   were generally broadly tuned and two largely separate populations of SD
   cells encoded future and previous saccade direction. Some properties of
   these cells resemble those of head-direction cells in rodent EC,
   suggesting that the same neural circuitry may be capable of performing
   homologous spatial computations under different exploratory contexts.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{3447-3456}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Aims Oxidative stress is thought to be a risk for cardiovascular disease
   and NADPH oxidases of the Nox family are important producers of reactive
   oxygen species. Within the Nox family, the NADPH oxidase Nox4 has a
   unique position as it is constitutively active and produces H2O2 rather
   than O-2(-). Nox4 is therefore incapable of scavenging NO and its low
   constitutive H2O2 production might even be beneficial. We hypothesized
   that Nox4 acts as an endogenous anti-atherosclerotic enzyme.
   Methods and results Tamoxifen-induced Nox4-knockout mice were crossed
   with ApoE(-/-) mice and spontaneous atherosclerosis under regular chow
   as well as accelerated atherosclerosis in response to partial carotid
   artery ligation under high-fat diet were determined. Deletion of Nox4
   resulted in increased atherosclerosis formation in both models.
   Mechanistically, pro-atherosclerotic and pro-inflammatory changes in
   gene expression were observed prior to plaque development. Moreover,
   inhibition of Nox4 or deletion of the enzyme in the endothelium but not
   in macrophages resulted in increased adhesion of macrophages to the
   endothelial surface.
   Conclusions The H2O2-producing NADPH oxidase Nox4 is an endogenous anti-
   atherosclerotic enzyme. Nox4 inhibitors, currently under clinical
   evaluation, should be carefully monitored for cardiovascular
   side-effects.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and electronic consequences of pi-pi and C-H/pi
   interactions in two alkoxy-substituted
   1,8-bis((propyloxyphenyl)ethynyl)naphthalenes are explored by using
   X-ray crystallography and electronic structure computations. The crystal
   structure of analogue 4, bearing an alkoxy side chain in the 4-position
   of each of the phenyl rings, adopts a pi-stacked geometry, whereas
   analogue 8, bearing alkoxy groups at both the 2- and the 5-positions of
   each ring, has a geometry in which the rings are splayed away from a
   pi-stacked arrangement. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory analysis
   was performed on the two analogues to evaluate the interactions between
   the phenylethynyl arms in each molecule in terms of electrostatic,
   steric, polarization, and London dispersion components. The computations
   support the expectation that the pi-stacked geometry of the alkoxyphenyl
   units in 4 is simply a consequence of maximizing pi-pi interactions.
   However, the splayed geometry of 8 results from a more subtle
   competition between different noncovalent interactions: this geometry
   provides a favorable anti-alignment of C-O bond dipoles, and two C-H/pi
   interactions in which hydrogen atoms of the alkyl side chains interact
   favorably with the pi electrons of the other phenyl ring. These
   favorable interactions overcome competing pi-pi interactions to give
   rise to a geometry in which the phenylethynyl substituents are in an
   offset, un-stacked arrangement.}},

   Interface Conductance Between Lennard-Jones Solids}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{To date, the established methods that describe thermal interface
   conductance (TIC) and include mode-level dependence have not included
   anharmonicity. The current intuition is therefore based on the behavior
   in the harmonic limit, whereby the extent of overlap in the bulk phonon
   density of states (DoS) (e.g., frequency overlap) dictates the TIC and
   more frequency overlap leads to higher TIC. Here, we study over 2,000
   interfaces described by the Lennard-Jones potential using equilibrium
   molecular dynamics simulations, whereby we systematically change the
   mass and stiffness of each side. We show that the trends in TIC do not
   generally follow that of the bulk phonon DoS overlap, but instead more
   closely follow the vibrational power spectrum overlap for the
   interfacial atoms. We then identify the frequency overlap in the
   interfacial power spectra as an improved descriptor for understanding
   the qualitative trends in TIC. Although improved, the results show that
   the basic intuition of frequency overlap is still insufficient to
   explain all of the features, as the remaining variations are shown to
   arise from anharmonicity, which is a critical effect to include in
   interface calculations above cryogenic temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Varying amounts of Co and Ni were substituted-into the metal organic
   framework Mg-MOF-74 via a one-pot solvothermal reaction, and the effects
   of these substitutions on CO2 adsorption and kinetic water stability
   properties were examined. Based on elemental analyses, Co and Ni are
   more favorably incorporated into the MOF-74 framework from solution than
   Mg. In addition, reaction temperature more strongly impacts the final
   metal composition in these mixed-metal (MM) MOF-74 structures than does
   the reaction solvent composition. Single-component CO2 adsorption
   isotherms were measured for the MM-MOF-74 systems at 5, 25, and 45
   degrees C, and isostetic heats of adsorption were calculated. These
   results suggest that CO2 adsorption properties can be adjusted by
   partial metal substitution. Water adsorption isotherms were also
   measured for the MM-MOF-74 samples, with powder X-ray diffraction
   patterns and Brunauer-Emmett Teller surface areas measured both before
   and after water exposure. Results show that Mg-MOF-74 can gain partial
   kinetic water stability by the incorporation of Ni2+ or CO2+ metal ions
   that are less vulnerable to hydrolysis than Mg2+. Of particular note, Mg
   Ni-MM-MOF-74 shows a significant increase in water stability when
   incorporating as little as 16 mol \% Ni into the Mg-MOF-74 structure.}},

Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{549-558}},

Abstract = {{A simplified qualitative analysis was performed to investigate the
   possibility of using counter flow induced draft cooling tower option to
   reject heat from the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle for
   advanced fast reactor (AFR)-100 and advanced burner reactor (ABR)-1000
   plants. A code was developed to estimate the tower dimensions, power and
   water consumption, and to perform economic analysis. The code developed
   was verified against a vendor provided quotation and is used to
   understand the effect of ambient air and water conditions on the design
   of cooling tower. The calculations indicated that there exists optimum
   water conditions for given ambient air conditions which will result in
   minimum power consumption, thereby increasing the cycle efficiency. A
   cost-based optimization technique is used to estimate the optimum water
   conditions which will improve the overall plant economics. A comparison
   of different cooling options for the S-CO2 cycle indicated that the
   cooling tower option is a much more practical and economical option
   compared to the dry air cooling or direct water cooling options. (c)

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of synthesized octahedral molecular
   sieve (OMS-2) nanoparticles on the anaerobic microbial community in a
   model digester, expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor. The
   addition of OMS-2 (0.025 g/L) in the EGSB reactors resulted in an
   enhanced operational performance, i.e., COD removal and biogas
   production increased by 4\% and 11\% respectively, and effluent volatile
   fatty acid (VFA) decreased by 11\% relative to the control group. The
   Biolog EcoPlate (TM) test was employed to investigate microbial
   metabolism in the EGSB reactors. Results showed that OMS-2 not only
   increased the microbial metabolic level but also significantly changed
   the community level physiological profiling of the microorganisms. The
   Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene indicated
   OMS-2 enhanced the microbial diversity and altered the community
   structure. The largest bacterial genus Lactococcus, a lactic acid
   bacterium, reduced from 29.3\% to 20.4\% by abundance in the presence of
   0.25 g/L OMS-2, which may be conducive to decreasing the VFA production
   and increasing the microbial diversity. OMS-2 also increased the
   quantities of acetogenic bacteria and Archaea, and promoted the
   acetogenesis and methanogenesis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   illustrated that Mn(IV)/Mn(III) with high redox potential in OMS-2 were
   reduced to Mn(II) in the EGSB reactors; this in turn affected the
   microbial community. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   no lower than 15 d; and b) total biogas (methane) production not to
   exceed a specific target level based on air permit constraints on CO2
   emissions. Primary sludge (PS), thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS)
   and digested sludge collected at the FWHWRC, industrial liquid waste
   obtained from a chewing gum manufacturing plant (GW) and dewatered
   fat-oil-grease (FOG) were used. All sludge and waste samples were
   characterized and their ultimate digestibility was assessed at 35
   degrees C. The ultimate COD to methane conversion of PS, TWAS, municipal
   sludge (PS + TWAS; 40:60 w/w TS basis), GW and FOG was 49.2, 35.2, 40.3,
   72.7, and 81.1\%, respectively. Co-digestion of municipal sludge with
   GW, FOG or both, was evaluated using four bench-scale, mesophilic (35
   degrees C) digesters. Biogas production increased significantly and
   additional degradation of the municipal sludge between 1.1 and 30.7\%
   was observed. Biogas and methane production was very close to the target
   levels necessary to close the energy deficit at the FWHWRC. Co-digestion
   resulted in an effluent quality similar to that of the control digester
   fed only with the municipal sludge, indicating that co-digestion had no
   adverse effects. Study results prove that high methane production is
   achievable with the addition of concentrated external organic wastes to
   municipal digesters, at acceptable higher digester organic loadings and
   lower retention times, allowing the effective implementation of CHP
   programs at municipal wastewater treatment plants, with significant cost
   savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic nitrates are an important aerosol constituent in locations where
   biogenic hydrocarbon emissions mix with anthropogenic NOx sources. While
   regional and global chemical transport models may include a
   representation of organic aerosol from monoterpene reactions with
   nitrate radicals (the primary source of particle-phase organic nitrates
   in the Southeast United States), secondary organic aerosol (SOA) models
   can underestimate yields. Furthermore, SOA parametrizations do not
   explicitly take into account organic nitrate compounds produced in the
   gas phase. In this work, we developed a coupled gas and aerosol system
   to describe the formation and subsequent aerosol-phase partitioning of
   organic nitrates from isoprene and monoterpenes with a focus on the
   Southeast United States. The concentrations of organic aerosol and
   gas-phase organic nitrates were improved when particulate organic
   nitrates were assumed to undergo rapid (tau = 3 h) pseudohydrolysis
   resulting in nitric acid and nonvolatile secondary organic aerosol. In
   addition, up to 60\% of less oxidized-oxygenated organic aerosol
   (LO-OOA) could be accounted for via organic nitrate mediated chemistry
   during the Southern Oxidants and Aerosol Study (SOAS). A 25\% reduction
   in nitrogen oxide (NO + NO2) emissions was predicted to cause a 9\%
   reduction in organic aerosol for June 2013 SOAS conditions at
   Centreville, Alabama.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a promising technique for harvesting
   energy by mixing seawater with river water. The energy production is
   usually limited by ionic conductivity in dilute compartments of a RED
   system. Novel tests were conducted in this research, which used
   ion-exchange resin beads (IERB) to replace nonconductive spacer fabrics
   in RED compartments with dilute NaCl solution in a modified stack
   containing Fumasep FKS and Fumasep FAS membranes. We compared the
   conductivity of an IERB packed bed with that of an inert
   glass-beads-packed bed as a control to confirm IERB's effectiveness.
   When applied in a RED system, IERB decreased the stack resistance by up
   to 40\%. The maximum gross power density improved by 83\% in the RED
   stack compared to that in a regular RED stack at 1.3 cm/s average linear
   flow velocity. IERB-filled stack resistance was modeled. The model
   results fit well with experimental data, thereby confirming the
   effectiveness of the new approach presented here. The net power density
   is also estimated based on the measured pressure drop and pumping energy
   model. Both gross and net power density was improved by over 75\% at
   higher flow rate. A net power density of 0.44 W/m(2) was achieved at a
   cell thickness of 500 mu m. To the best of our knowledge, this research
   is the first to study the impact of IERB on power generation and
   establishes a new approach to improving the power performance of a RED
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Systems approaches have been used to describe molecular signatures
   driving immunity to influenza vaccination in humans. Whether such
   signatures are similar across multiple seasons and in diverse
   populations is unknown. We applied systems approaches to study immune
   responses in young, elderly, and diabetic subjects vaccinated with the
   seasonal influenza vaccine across five consecutive seasons. Signatures
   of innate immunity and plasmablasts correlated with and predicted
   influenza antibody titers at 1 month after vaccination with >80\%
   accuracy across multiple seasons but were not associated with the
   longevity of the response. Baseline signatures of lymphocyte and
   monocyte inflammation were positively and negatively correlated,
   respectively, with antibody responses at 1 month. Finally, integrative
   analysis of microRNAs and transcriptomic profiling revealed potential
   regulators of vaccine immunity. These results identify shared
   vaccine-induced signatures across multiple seasons and in diverse
   populations and might help guide the development of next-generation
   vaccines that provide persistent immunity against influenza.}},

   and the low loading silane adsorbents (similar to 0.45 mmol silane/g)
   are evaluated for their CO2 adsorption properties, with a focus on
   gaining insight into the propensity for intramolecular vs intermolecular
   CO2 adsorption. Adsorption isotherms at low CO2 coverages are measured
   while simultaneously recording the heat evolved via a Tian-Calvet
   calorimeter. The results are compared on a silane molecule efficiency
   basis (mol CO2 adsorbed/ mol silane) to assess the potential for
   intramolecular-CO2-adsorption, employing two amine groups in a single
   silane molecule. As the number of amines in the silane molecule
   increases (MONO < DI < TREN similar to TRI), the silane molecule
   efficiency is enhanced owing to the ability to intramolecularly capture
   CO2. Analysis of the CO2 uptake for samples with the surface silanols
   removed by capping demonstrates that cooperative uptake due to amine CO2
   silanol interactions is also possible over these adsorbents and is the
   primary mode of sorption for the MONO material at the studied low silane
   loading. As the propensity for intramolecular CO2 capture increases due
   to the presence of multiple amines in a single silane molecule (MONO <
   DI < TREN similar to TRI), the measured heat of adsorption also
   increases. This study of various amine-containing silanes at low
   coverage is the first to provide significant, direct evidence for
   intramolecular CO2 capture in a single silane molecule. Furthermore, it
   provides evidence for the relative heats of adsorption for physisorption
   on a silanol laden surface (ca. 37 kJ/mol), a silanol-capped surface
   (ca. 25 kJ/mol), via amine CO2 silanol interactions (ca. 46 kJ/mol), and
   via amine CO2 amine interactions at low surface coverages (ca. 65
   kj/mol).}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Fretting wear is the most common failure mechanism in electrical
   connectors for automotive applications. In this study, the fretting wear
   behavior of laser-textured tin-coated copper contacts has been
   investigated, focusing on the temporal evolution of wear debris
   formation and its relation to the electrical contact resistance. The
   dot-like pattern was produced on the samples by interfering laser beams
   with a period of 7.5 pm. A fretting apparatus was used for testing,
   applying two different normal loads (2.5 and 5.0 N). The
   fretting-induced chemical and topographical changes were studied by
   scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam, Raman spectroscopy, and
   X-ray diffraction. This analysis revealed the formation of oxide
   particles (SnO and CuO) and of a closed intermetallic layer (Cu6Sn5).
   For CuO, the transition from loosely-packed wear particles to a dense
   layer is observed. During the entire experiment, the SnO particles
   remain as compact agglomerates without showing any layer formation.
   Based upon these observations, a model for the non-textured reference
   was developed, describing the processes taking place during fretting
   wear. Furthermore, it can be concluded that under the studied conditions
   the laser interference pattering reduces the coefficient of friction and
   the contact resistance by up to approx. 12\% and 71\%, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a
   promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment and several distinct
   small molecule histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been
   reported. We have previously identified a new class of non-peptide
   macrocyclic HDACi derived from 14- and 15-membered macrolide skeletons.
   In these HDACi, the macrocyclic ring is linked to the zinc chelating
   hydroxamate moiety through a para-substituted aryl-triazole cap group.
   To further delineate the depth of the SAR of this class of HDACi, we
   have synthesized series of analogous compounds and investigated the
   influence of various substitution patterns on their HDAC inhibitory,
   anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities. We identified
   compounds 25b and 38f with robust anti-proliferative activities and
   compound 26f (IC50 47.2 nM) with superior anti-inflammatory (IC50 88 nM)
   activity relative to SAHA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new undersampling-based dual-rate signal acquisition technique for
   measuring a wideband sparse signal (i.e., a multiband signal) is
   presented in this paper. The proposed architecture employs a combination
   of dual-rate time-interleaved undersampling hardware and associated
   multicoset back-end signal processing algorithms. In dual-rate sampling
   hardware, a pair of uniform samplers is used to acquire a common
   incoming wideband sparse signal while the operation frequencies of the
   two samplers have a small frequency offset. Due to the sampling
   frequency offset, the time grids of the samples obtained from the two
   samplers are irregularly spaced. These nonuniform periodic samples are
   then digitally re-sequenced and applied as input to a multicoset signal
   reconstruction algorithm. The multicoset signal reconstruction algorithm
   uses the re-sequenced nonuniform periodic samples to achieve a perfect
   reconstruction of the original wideband signal with an enhanced time
   resolution beyond the sampling hardware's capability. Compared to the
   conventional multi-channel sampling approach commonly used with
   multicoset algorithms, the proposed method uses fewer sampling channels
   and does not require their accurate clock phase adjustment.}},

Pages = {{6673-6683}},

Abstract = {{Amplitude comparison monopulse systems provide precision angle
   localization of a target. In practice, the in-phase part of the
   monopulse ratio is commonly used for direction-of-arrival (DOA)
   estimation due to simplicity and computational speed, but it suffers
   poor performance for off-boresight and/or low signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) targets. Target energy is typically assumed to be contained in a
   single range bin, while in practice the matched filter sampling process
   often results in multiple adjacent matched filter samples with target
   energy. In the traditional radar literature, this is called bin
   straddling and is typically treated as a nuisance-an undesired loss of
   signal energy. Recent literature has addressed bin straddling for DOA
   and range estimation for the case of multiple unresolved targets.
   However, error variance reports on those target estimates, which are
   required by target tracking algorithms, are not provided. Furthermore,
   target strength is assumed to be a known parameter, which is often not
   valid in practice. Here, we explicitly incorporate sampling into the
   statistical model for sum and difference channel signal samples, and
   derive estimators for the unknown range and unknown DOA of a single
   Rayleigh target. Closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on those
   estimators are provided. Furthermore, we propose the generalized CRLB
   (GCRLB) as an error variance report, and SNRs required for statistical
   efficiency and variance consistency are provided.}},

Abstract = {{10-period Al0.57Ga0.43N/Al0.38Ga0.62N multi-quantum wells (MQWs) were
   grown on a relaxed Al0.58Ga0.42N buffer on AlN templates on sapphire.
   The threading dislocations and V-pits were characterized and their
   origin is discussed. The influence of V-pits on the structural quality
   of the MQWs and on optical emission at 280 nm was analyzed. It was
   observed that near-surface V-pits were always associated with grain
   boundaries consisting of edge threading dislocations originating from
   the AlN/Al2O3 interface. Although the high density of V-pits disrupted
   MQWs growth, it did not affect the internal quantum efficiency which was
   measured to be similar to 1\% at room temperature even when V-pit
   density was increased from 7 x 10(7) cm(-2) to 2 x 10(9) cm(-2). The
   results help to understand the origin, propagation and influences of the
   typical defects in AlGaN MQWs grown on AlN/Al2O3 templates which may
   lead to further improvement of the performance of DUV devices. (C) 2015

Title = {{A combined evidence Bayesian method for human ancestry inference applied

Journal = {{GENE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{574}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{345-351}},

Abstract = {{Uniparental genetic markers, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosomal
   DNA, are widely used for the inference of human ancestry. However, the
   resolution of ancestral origins based on mtDNA haplotypes is limited by
   the fact that such haplotypes are often found to be distributed across
   wide geographical regions. We have addressed this issue here by
   combining two sources of ancestry information that have typically been
   considered separately: historical records regarding population origins
   and genetic information on mtDNA haplotypes. To combine these distinct
   data sources, we applied a Bayesian approach that considers historical
   records, in the form of prior probabilities, together with data on the
   geographical distribution of mtDNA haplotypes, formulated as
   likelihoods, to yield ancestry assignments from posterior probabilities.
   This combined evidence Bayesian approach to ancestry assignment was
   evaluated for its ability to accurately assign sub-continental African
   ancestral origins to Afro-Colombians based on their mtDNA haplotypes. We
   demonstrate that the incorporation of historical prior probabilities via
   this analytical framework can provide for substantially increased
   resolution in subcontinental African ancestry assignment for members of
   this population. In addition, a personalized approach to ancestry
   assignment that involves the tuning of priors to individual mtDNA
   haplotypes yields even greater resolution for individual ancestry
   assignment. Despite the fact that Colombia has a large population of
   Afro-descendants, the ancestry of this community has been understudied
   relative to populations with primarily European and Native American
   ancestry. Thus, the application of the kind of combined evidence
   approach developed here to the study of ancestry in the Afro-Colombian
   population has the potential to be impactful. The formal Bayesian
   analytical framework we propose for combining historical and genetic
   information also has the potential to be widely applied across various
   global populations and for different genetic markers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{We report an electroluminescence (EL) study on npn GaN/InGaN
   heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). Three radiative recombination
   paths are resolved in the HBTs, corresponding to the band-to-band
   transition (3.3 eV), conduction-band-to-acceptor-level transition (3.15
   eV), and yellow luminescence (YL) with the emission peak at 2.2 eV. We
   further study possible light emission paths by operating the HBTs under
   different biasing conditions. The band-to-band and the
   conduction-band-to-acceptor-level transitions mostly arise from the
   intrinsic base region, while a defect-related YL band could likely
   originate from the quasi-neutral base region of a GaN/InGaN HBT. The
   I-B-dependent EL intensities for these three recombination paths are
   discussed. The results also show the radiative emission under the

Abstract = {{We demonstrated onset of deep-ultraviolet (DUV) surface stimulated
   emission (SE) from c-plane AlGaN multiple-quantum well (MQW)
   heterostructures grown on a sapphire substrate by optical pumping at
   room temperature. The onset of SE became observable at a pumping power
   density of 630 kW/cm(2). Spectral deconvolution revealed superposition
   of a linearly amplified spontaneous emission peak at lambda similar to
   257.0 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of similar to 12nm and
   a superlinearly amplified SE peak at lambda similar to 260 nm with a
   narrow FWHM of less than 2 nm. In particular, the wavelength of similar
   to 260 nm is the shortest wavelength of surface SE from III-nitride MQW
   heterostructures to date. Atomic force microscopy and scanning
   transmission electron microscopy measurements were employed to
   investigate the material and structural quality of the AlGaN
   heterostructures, showing smooth surface and sharp layer interfaces.
   This study offers promising results for AlGaN heterostructures grown on
   sapphire substrates for the development of DUV vertical cavity surface
   emitting lasers (VCSELs). (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with graded porous cathode were
   fabricated via a multilayer tape casting and co-firing technique, which
   is a low-cost and reproducible fabrication process. The effects of pore
   formers,on the electrochemical performance of graded cathode are studied
   to minimize cathodic polarization resistance. Examination of the
   microstructures reveals that the multilayer single cell had no
   delamination, observable cracks, or other large defects. The cell
   prepared by the co-firing process exhibits low interfacial polarization
   resistance and high power density at the operating temperature range of
   700 -800 degrees C. This simple fabrication technique can be used for
   optimization of electrode microstructures and cost-effective fabrication

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{We establish a reliable quantum-mechanical approach to evaluate the
   vibrational properties of donor-acceptor molecular crystals. The
   anthracene-PMDA (PMDA = pyromellitic dianhydride) crystal, where
   anthracene acts as the electron donor and PMDA as the electron acceptor,
   is taken as a representative system for which experimental non-resonance
   Raman spectra are also reported. We first investigate the impact that
   the amount of nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange (HFE) included in a hybrid
   density functional has on the geometry, normal vibrational modes,
   electronic coupling, and electron-vibrational (phonon) couplings. The
   comparison between experimental and theoretical Raman spectra indicates
   that the results based on the aPBE functional with 25\%-35\% HFE are in
   better agreement with the experimental results compared to those
   obtained with the pure PBE functional. Then, taking aPBE with 25\% HFE,
   we assign the vibrational modes and examine their contributions to the
   relaxation energy related to the nonlocal electron-vibration
   interactions. The results show that the largest contribution (about
   90\%) is due to electron interactions with low-frequency vibrational
   modes. The relaxation energy in anthracene-PMDA is found to be about
   five times smaller than the electronic coupling. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{We introduce an intramolecular energy decomposition scheme for analyzing
   non-covalent interactions within molecules in the spirit of
   symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). The proposed intra-SAPT
   approach is based upon the Chemical Hamiltonian of Mayer {[}Int. J.
   Quantum Chem. 23(2), 341-363 (1983)] and the recently introduced
   zeroth-order wavefunction {[} J. F. Gonthier and C. Corminboeuf, J.
   Chem. Phys. 140(15), 154107 (2014)]. The scheme decomposes the
   interaction energy between weakly bound fragments located within the
   same molecule into physically meaningful components, i.e.,
   electrostatic-exchange, induction, and dispersion. Here, we discuss the
   key steps of the approach and demonstrate that a single-determinant
   wavefunction can already deliver a detailed and insightful description
   of a wide range of intramolecular non-covalent phenomena such as
   hydrogen bonds, dihydrogen contacts, and pi - pi stacking interactions.
   Intra-SAPT is also used to shed the light on competing intra-and
   intermolecular interactions. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{We present the first direct measurements of the rest-frame 10-40 keV
   X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based
   on a sample of 94 sources at 0.1 < z < 3, selected at 8-24 keV energies
   from sources in the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)
   extragalactic survey program. Our results are consistent with the strong
   evolution of the AGN population seen in prior, lower-energy studies of
   the XLF. However, different models of the intrinsic distribution of
   absorption, which are used to correct for selection biases, give
   significantly different predictions for the total number of sources in
   our sample, leading to small, systematic differences in our binned
   estimates of the XLF. Adopting a model with a lower intrinsic fraction
   of Compton-thick sources and a larger population of sources with column
   densities N-H similar to 10(23-24) cm(-2) or a model with stronger
   Compton reflection component (with a relative normalization of R similar
   to 2 at all luminosities) can bring extrapolations of the XLF from 2-10
   keV into agreement with our NuSTAR sample. Ultimately, X-ray spectral
   analysis of the NuSTAR sources is required to break this degeneracy
   between the distribution of absorbing column densities and the strength
   of the Compton reflection component and thus refine our measurements of
   the XLF. Furthermore, the models that successfully describe the
   high-redshift population seen by NuSTAR tend to over-predict previous,
   high-energy measurements of the local XLF, indicating that there is
   evolution of the AGN population that is not fully captured by the
   current models.}},

Abstract = {{We present two Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)
   observations of the local Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and an
   ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) candidate in NGC 5643. Together with
   archival data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift-BAT, we perform a
   high-quality broadband spectral analysis of the AGN over two decades in
   energy (similar to 0.5-100 keV). Previous X-ray observations suggested
   that the AGN is obscured by a Compton-thick (CT) column of obscuring gas
   along our line of sight. However, the lack of high-quality greater than
   or similar to 10 keV observations, together with the presence of a
   nearby X-ray luminous source, NGC 5643 X-1, have left significant
   uncertainties in the characterization of the nuclear spectrum. NuSTAR
   now enables the AGN and NGC 5643 X-1 to be separately resolved above 10
   keV for the first time and allows a direct measurement of the absorbing
   column density toward the nucleus. The new data show that the nucleus is
   indeed obscured by a CT column of N-H greater than or similar to 5 x
   10(24) cm(-2). The range of 2-10 keV absorption-corrected luminosity
   inferred from the bestfitting models is L-2-10,L-int = (0.8-1.7) x
   10(42) erg s(-1), consistent with that predicted from multiwavelength
   intrinsic luminosity indicators. In addition, we also study the NuSTAR
   data for NGC 5643 X-1 and show that it exhibits evidence of a spectral
   cutoff at energy E similar to 10 keV, similar to that seen in other ULXs
   observed by NuSTAR. Along with the evidence for significant X-ray
   luminosity variations in the 3-8 keV band from 2003 to 2014, our results
   further strengthen the ULX classification of NGC 5643 X-1.}},

Abstract = {{We control the relative coupling strength of carrier and first-order
   motional sideband interactions of a trapped ion by placing it in a
   resonant optical standing wave. Our configuration uses the surface of a
   microfabricated chip trap as a mirror, avoiding technical challenges of
   in-vacuum optical cavities. Displacing the ion along the standing wave,
   we show a periodic suppression of the carrier and sideband transitions
   with the cycles for the two cases 180 degrees. out of phase with each
   other. This technique allows for the suppression of off-resonant carrier
   excitations when addressing the motional sidebands, and has applications
   in quantum simulation and quantum control. Using the standing-wave
   fringes, we measure the relative ion height as a function of applied
   electric field, allowing for a precise measurement of ion displacement
   and, combined with measured micromotion amplitudes, a validation of trap
   numerical models.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{205-214}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{One of the most challenging and clinically important goals in
   nanomedicine is to deliver imaging and therapeutic agents to solid
   tumors. Here we discuss the recent design and development of
   stimuli-responsive smart nanoparticles for targeting the common
   attributes of solid tumors such as their acidic and hypoxic
   microenvironments. This class of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles is
   inactive during blood circulation and under normal physiological
   conditions, but is activated by acidic pH, enzymatic up-regulation, or
   hypoxia once they extravasate into the tumor microenvironment. The
   nanoparticles are often designed to first ``navigate{''} the body's
   vascular system, ``dock{''} at the tumor sites, and then ``activate{''}
   for action inside the tumor interstitial space. They combine the
   favorable biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of nanodelivery
   vehicles and the rapid diffusion and penetration properties of smaller
   drug cargos. By targeting the broad tumor habitats rather than
   tumor-specific receptors, this strategy has the potential to overcome
   the tumor heterogeneity problem and could be used to design diagnostic
   and therapeutic nanoparticles for a broad range of solid tumors. (C)

Abstract = {{While successful vaccines have been developed against many pathogens,
   there are still many diseases and pathogenic infections that are highly
   evasive to current vaccination strategies. Thus, more sophisticated
   approaches to control the type and quality of vaccine-induced immune
   response must be developed. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the sentinels of
   the body and play a critical role in immune response generation and
   direction by bridging innate and adaptive immunity. It is now well
   recognized that DCs can be separated into many subgroups, each of which
   has a unique function. Better understanding of how various DC subsets,
   in lymphoid organs and in the periphery, can be targeted through
   controlled delivery; and how these subsets modulate and control the
   resulting immune response could greatly enhance our ability to develop
   new, effective vaccines against complex diseases. In this review, we
   provide an overview of DC subset biology and discuss current
   immunotherapeutic strategies that utilize DC targeting to modulate and
   control immune responses. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The characterization of the bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs)
   hinge microflow fields is a crucial step in heart valve engineering.
   Earlier in vitro studies of BMHV hinge flow at the aorta position in
   idealized straight pipes have shown that the aortic sinus shapes and
   sizes may have a direct impact on hinge microflow fields. In this paper,
   we used a numerical study to look at how different aortic sinus shapes,
   the downstream aortic arch geometry, and the location of the hinge
   recess can influence the flow fields in the hinge regions. Two geometric
   models for sinus were investigated: a simplified axisymmetric sinus and
   an idealized three-sinus aortic root model, with two different
   downstream geometries: a straight pipe and a simplified curved aortic
   arch. The flow fields of a 29-mm St Jude Medical BMHV with its four
   hinges were investigated. The simulations were performed throughout the
   entire cardiac cycle. At peak systole, recirculating flows were observed
   in curved downsteam aortic arch unlike in straight downstream pipe.
   Highly complex three-dimensional leakage flow through the hinge gap was
   observed in the simulation results during early diastole with the
   highest velocity at 4.7m/s, whose intensity decreased toward late
   diastole. Also, elevated wall shear stresses were observed in the
   ventricular regions of the hinge recess with the highest recorded at
   1.65kPa. Different flow patterns were observed between the hinge regions
   in straight pipe and curved aortic arch models. We compared the four
   hinge regions at peak systole in an aortic arch downstream model and
   found that each individual hinge did not vary much in terms of the
   leakage flow rate through the valves.}},

Title = {{How chip size impacts steam pretreatment effectiveness for biological
   conversion of poplar wood into fermentable sugars}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Woody biomass is highly recalcitrant to enzymatic sugar
   release and often requires significant size reduction and severe
   pretreatments to achieve economically viable sugar yields in biological
   production of sustainable fuels and chemicals. However, because
   mechanical size reduction of woody biomass can consume significant
   amounts of energy, it is desirable to minimize size reduction and
   instead pretreat larger wood chips prior to biological conversion. To
   date, however, most laboratory research has been performed on materials
   that are significantly smaller than applicable in a commercial setting.
   As a result, there is a limited understanding of the effects that larger
   biomass particle size has on the effectiveness of steam explosion
   pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of wood chips.
   Results: To address these concerns, novel downscaled analysis and high
   throughput pretreatment and hydrolysis (HTPH) were applied to examine
   whether differences exist in the composition and digestibility within a
   single pre-treated wood chip due to heterogeneous pretreatment across
   its thickness. Heat transfer modeling, Simons' stain testing, magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were
   applied to probe the effects of pretreatment within and between
   pretreated wood samples to shed light on potential causes of variation,
   pointing to enzyme accessibility (i.e., pore size) distribution being a
   key factor dictating enzyme digestibility in these samples. Application
   of these techniques demonstrated that the effectiveness of pretreatment
   of Populus tremuloides can vary substantially over the chip thickness at
   short pretreatment times, resulting in spatial digestibility effects and
   overall lower sugar yields in subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that rapid decompression
   pretreatments (e.g., steam explosion) that specifically alter
   accessibility at lower temperature conditions are well suited for larger
   wood chips due to the non-uniformity in temperature and digestibility
   profiles that can result from high temperature and short pretreatment
   times. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated that wood chips were
   hydrated primarily through the natural pore structure during
   pretreatment, suggesting that preserving the natural grain and transport
   systems in wood during storage and chipping processes could likely
   promote pretreatment efficacy and uniformity.}},

Title = {{The sweet branch of metabolic engineering: cherry-picking the
   low-hanging sugary fruits}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{In the first science review on the then nascent Metabolic Engineering
   field in 1991, Dr. James E. Bailey described how improving
   erythropoietin (EPO) glycosylation can be achieved via metabolic
   engineering of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In the intervening
   decades, metabolic engineering has brought sweet successes in
   glycoprotein engineering, including antibodies, vaccines, and other
   human therapeutics. Today, not only eukaryotes (CHO, plant, insect,
   yeast) are being used for manufacturing protein therapeutics with
   human-like glycosylation, newly elucidated bacterial glycosylation
   systems are enthusiastically embraced as potential breakthrough to
   revolutionize the biopharmaceutical industry. Notwithstanding these
   excitement in glycoprotein, the sweet metabolic engineering reaches far
   beyond glycoproteins. Many different types of oligo-and poly-saccharides
   are synthesized with metabolically engineered cells. For example,
   several recombinant hyaluronan bioprocesses are now in commercial
   production, and the titer of 2'-fucosyllactose, the most abundant
   fucosylated trisaccharide in human milk, reaches over 20 g/L with
   engineered E. coli cells. These successes represent only the first low
   hanging fruits, which have been appreciated scientifically, medically
   and fortunately, commercially as well. As one of the four building
   blocks of life, sugar molecules permeate almost all aspects of life.
   They are also unique in being intimately associated with all major types
   of biopolymers (including DNA/RNA, proteins, lipids) meanwhile they
   stand alone as bioactive polysaccharides, or free soluble
   oligosaccharides. As such, all sugar moieties in biological components,
   small or big and free or bound, are important targets for metabolic
   engineering. Opportunities abound at the interface of glycosciences and
   metabolic engineering. Continued investment and successes in this branch
   of metabolic engineering will make vastly diverse sugar-containing
   molecules (a.k.a. glycoconjugates) available for biomedical
   applications, sustainable technology development, and as invaluable
   tools for basic scientific research. This short review focuses on the
   most recent development in the field, with emphasis on the synthesis
   technology for glycoprotein, polysaccharide, and oligosaccharide.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the growing heat removal issue of modern electronic devices,
   polymer composites with high thermal conductivity have drawn much
   attention in the past few years. However, a traditional method to
   enhance the thermal conductivity of the polymers by addition of
   inorganic fillers usually creates composite with not only limited
   thermal conductivity but also other detrimental effects due to large
   amount of fillers required. Here, novel polymer composites are reported
   by first constructing 3D boron nitride nanosheets (3D-BNNS) network
   using ice-templated approach and then infiltrating them with epoxy
   matrix. The obtained polymer composites exhibit a high thermal
   conductivity (2.85 W m(-1) K-1), a low thermal expansion coeffi cient
   (24-32 ppm K-1), and an increased glass transition temperature (T-g) at
   relatively low BNNSs loading (9.29 vol\%). These results demonstrate
   that this approach opens a new avenue for design and preparation of
   polymer composites with high thermal conductivity. The polymer
   composites are potentially useful in advanced electronic packaging
   techniques, namely, thermal interface materials, underfill materials,
   molding compounds, and organic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Isolation of ventricular cardiomyocytes (vCMs) has been challenging due
   to the lack of specific surface markers. Here we show that vCMs can be
   purified from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using
   molecular beacons (MBs) targeting specific intracellular mRNAs. We
   designed MBs (IRX4 MBs) to target mRNA encoding Iroquois homeobox
   protein 4 (Irx4), a transcription factor specific for vCMs. To purify
   mESC vCMs, IRX4 MBs were delivered into cardiomyogenically
   differentiating mESCs, and IRX4 MBs-positive cells were FACS-sorted. We
   found that, of the cells isolated, similar to 98\% displayed vCM-like
   action potentials by electrophysiological analyses. These MB-purified
   vCMs continuously maintained their CM characteristics as verified by
   spontaneous beating, Ca2+ transient, and expression of vCM-specific
   proteins. Our study shows the feasibility of isolating pure vCMs via
   cell sorting without modifying host genes. The homogeneous and
   functional ventricular CMs generated via the MB-based method can be
   useful for disease investigation, drug discovery, and cell-based

Abstract = {{In recent years, thin, lightweight and flexible solid supercapacitors
   are of considerable interest as energy storage devices. Here we
   demonstrated all-solid supercapacitors (SSCs) with high electrochemical
   properties, low self-discharge characteristics based on manganese
   dioxide/polyaniline (MNW/PANI) coaxial nanowire networks. The
   synergistic effect of MnO2/PANI plus the unique coaxial nanostructure of
   the ultralong nanowires with a highly interconnected network effectively
   enhance the conductivity and capacitive performance of the SSCs device.
   The MNW/PANI composite with 62.5\% MnO2 exhibits an outstanding areal
   specific capacitance reaching 346 mF/cm(2) at 5 mV s(-1) which is
   significant higher than most previously reported solid supercapacitors
   (15.3 mF/cm(2)-109 mF/cm(2)) and is close to the that of the best
   graphene films solid state supercapacitors (372 mF/cm(2)). In contrast,
   only 190 mF/cm(2) of areal specific capacitance was obtained for the
   pure MnO2 NW network. The supercapacitors also exhibited low leakage
   current as small as 20.1 mu A, which demonstrated that the MNW/PANI SSCs
   have great potential for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Continued advances in next generation short-read sequencing
   technologies are increasing throughput and read lengths, while driving
   down error rates. Taking advantage of the high coverage sampling used in
   many applications, several error correction algorithms have been
   developed to improve data quality further. However, correcting errors in
   high coverage sequence data requires significant computing resources.
   Methods: We propose a different approach to handle erroneous sequence
   data. Presently, error rates of highthroughput platforms such as the
   Illumina HiSeq are within 1\%. Moreover, the errors are not uniformly
   distributed in all reads, and a large percentage of reads are indeed
   error-free. Ability to predict such perfect reads can significantly
   impact the run-time complexity of applications. We present a simple and
   fast k-spectrum analysis based method to identify error-free reads. The
   filtration process to identify and weed out erroneous reads can be
   customized at several levels of stringency depending upon the downstream
   application need.
   Results: Our experiments show that if around 80\% of the reads in a
   dataset are perfect, then our method retains almost 99.9\% of them with
   more than 90\% precision rate. Though filtering out reads identified as
   erroneous by our method reduces the average coverage by about 7\%, we
   found the remaining reads provide as uniform a coverage as the original
   dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on an example
   downstream application: we show that an error correction algorithm,
   Reptile, which rely on collectively analyzing the reads in a dataset to
   identify and correct erroneous bases, instead use reads predicted to be
   perfect by our method to correct the other reads, the overall accuracy
   improves further by up to 10\%.
   Conclusions: Thanks to the continuous technological improvements, the
   coverage and accuracy of reads from dominant sequencing platforms have
   now reached an extent where we can envision just filtering out reads
   with errors, thus making error correction less important. Our algorithm
   is a first attempt to propose and demonstrate this new paradigm.
   Moreover, our demonstration is applicable to any error correction
   algorithm as a downstream application, this in turn gives a new class of
   error correcting algorithms as a by product.}},

Title = {{Using an energized oxygen micro-jet for improved graphene etching by
   focused electron beam}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{We report on an improved Focused Electron Beam Induced Etching (FEBIE)
   process, which exploits heated oxygen delivery via a continuous
   supersonic micro-jet resulting in faster graphene patterning and better
   etch feature definition. Positioning a micro-jet in close proximity to a
   graphene surface with minimal jet spreading due to a continuous regime
   of gas flow at the exit of the 10 mu m inner diameter capillary allows
   for focused exposure of the surface to reactive oxygen at high mass flux
   and impingement energy of a supersonic gas stream localized to a small
   etching area exposed to electron beam. These unique benefits of focused
   supersonic oxygen delivery to the surface enable a dramatic increase in
   the etch rate of graphene with no parasitic carbon ``halo{''} deposition
   due to secondary electrons from backscattered electrons (BSE) in the
   area surrounding the etched regions. Increase of jet temperature via
   local nozzle heating provides means for enhancing kinetic energy of
   impinging oxygen molecules, which further speed up the etch, thus
   minimizing the beam exposure time and required electron dose, before
   parasitic carbon film deposition due to BSE mediated decomposition of
   adsorbed hydrocarbon contaminants has a measurable impact on quality of
   graphene etched features. Interplay of different physical mechanisms
   underlying an oxygen micro-jet assisted FEBIE process is discussed with
   support from experimental observations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A simple modification of a conventional nickel-yttria stabilized
   zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) by BaCO3 can
   enhance the coking resistance of the anode in carbon-containing fuels.
   In this study, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and
   thermogravimetric analysis are used to investigate the chemical
   reactions among BaCO3, NiO, and YSZ to understand the phase formation
   and compositions during fabrication process. Our results indicate that
   BaCO3 reacts readily with YSZ to produce a BaZr1-xYxO3-delta (BZY) phase
   at temperatures higher than 900 degrees C. For the mixture of BaCO3 and
   NiO, both BaNiO3 and BaNiO2.36 are formed at 900 degrees C, which are
   unstable at elevated temperatures, in the presence of YSZ, or under a
   reducing atmosphere. The results imply that a BZY/YSZ-BaO/Ni anode can
   be easily created by a simple heat-treatment (e.g., during cell
   fabrication) and a subsequent reducing process (e.g., exposure to the
   fuel) of a mixture consisting of BaCO3, NiO, and YSZ. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Total ellipse of the heart valve: the impact of eccentric stent
   distortion on the regional dynamic deformation of pericardial tissue
   leaflets of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{113}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVRs) are a percutaneous
   alternative to surgical aortic valve replacements and are used to treat
   patients with aortic valve stenosis. This minimally invasive procedure
   relies on expansion of the TAVR stent to radially displace calcified
   aortic valve leaflets against the aortic root wall. However, these
   calcium deposits can impede the expansion of the device causing
   distortion of the valve stent and pericardial tissue leaflets. The
   objective of this study was to elucidate the impact of eccentric TAVR
   stent distortion on the dynamic deformation of the tissue leaflets of
   the prosthesis in vitro. Dual-camera stereophotogrammetry was used to
   measure the regional variation in strain in a leaflet of a TAVR deployed
   in nominal circular and eccentric (eccentricity index = 28\%) orifices,
   representative of deployed TAVRs in vivo. It was observed that (i)
   eccentric stent distortion caused incorrect coaptation of the leaflets
   at peak diastole resulting in a `peel-back' leaflet geometry that was
   not present in the circular valve and (ii) adverse bending of the
   leaflet, arising in the eccentric valve at peak diastole, caused
   significantly higher commissure strains compared with the circular valve
   in both normotensive and hypertensive pressure conditions (normotension:
   eccentric = 13.76 +/- 2.04\% versus circular = 11.77 +/- 1.61\%, p =
   0.0014, hypertension: eccentric = 15.07 +/- 1.13\% versus circular =
   13.56 +/- 0.87\%, p = 0.0042). This study reveals that eccentric
   distortion of a TAVR stent can have a considerable impact on dynamic
   leaflet deformation, inducing deleterious bending of the leaflet and
   increasing commissures strains, which might expedite leaflet structural
   failure compared to leaflets in a circular deployed valve.}},

Title = {{Potassium incorporated alumina based CO2 capture sorbents: Comparison
   with supported amine sorbents under ultra-dilute capture conditions}},
Journal = {{COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{486}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Amines supported on silica or alumina supports are among the most
   well-studied sorbents for CO2 capture from ultra-dilute sources, such as
   ambient air. Another class of sorbents that may also bind CO2 strongly
   enough to function well under ultra-dilute conditions are supported
   alkali metal based compositions. In this work, the synthesis of
   alumina-supported potassium (AlK) via calcination of impregnated
   potassium acetate is described and the resulting materials are evaluated
   for CO2 capture under ultra-dilute conditions (1\% CO2), including under
   simulated air capture conditions (400 ppm CO2). The sorbents are
   evaluated at different adsorption and regeneration temperatures
   alongside two benchmark alumina-supported amine sorbents. The
   potassium-alumina sorbents are found to adsorb more CO2 than the amine
   benchmark sorbent at the tested 1\% CO2 conditions, whereas the amine
   sorbent yielded a higher uptake under simulated air capture conditions
   of 400 ppm. Abbreviated adsorption isotherms are measured for the
   potassium-alumina sorbents at three temperatures, the isotherms are fit
   to a single site Toth adsorption model, and the assembled data are
   utilized to estimate the heat of adsorption using the Clausius-Clapeyron
   equation. The isosteric heat of adsorption for the potassium based
   sorbent is higher than those estimated and measured for amine based
   sorbents, which is consistent with the higher regeneration temperature
   required by the potassium based sorbents. Potassium-alumina sorbents may
   be useful adsorbents for ultra-dilute conditions due to their stability
   in oxygen relative to amine sorbents if plentiful heat is available for
   the significant temperature swings needed to effectively cycle the
   sorbents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fractal-like aggregates exhibit interesting properties that determine
   their physicochemical advantages, and thus, the control and prediction
   of aggregation is critical for many applications. An off-lattice kinetic
   Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation was performed to investigate the aggregate
   evolution from primary particles to three-dimensional fractal
   aggregates, at three different volume fractions. We have found that at
   low volume fraction, aggregation kinetics is slow, and aggregate
   morphology is widely open and stringy, with fractal dimension of (D-f)
   1.8, in which the system is constantly preserved in the dilute regime.
   In denser volume fractions, however, the aggregation kinetics appears to
   be accelerated and aggregate morphology is more compact and less stringy
   due to the transition from dilute to dense regimes. Moreover, the volume
   fractions determine what kind of coagulation mechanism may occur to
   produce aggregates with different morphologies. At low volume fraction,
   coagulation is predominated by coagulation between aggregates in which
   the maximum probability of interpenetration event is only 18\%. This
   suggests that aggregates at low volume fraction can maintain their
   self-similarity behavior. While at high volume fraction, coagulation is
   predominated by two subsequent coagulation mechanisms, namely, primary
   particle-aggregate and aggregate-aggregate interaction. The probability
   of interpenetration event increases up to 40\%. In addition, the
   interpenetration process as well as the primary particle-aggregate
   coagulation, particularly in the dense regime, could produce
   superaggregates with a hybrid structure with a high fractal dimension at
   large size scales and a low fractal dimension at small scales. A detail
   mechanism for the formation of superaggregates was discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of multiply twinned Pd@Pt core shell
   concave decahedra by controlling the deposition of Pt on preformed Pd
   decahedral seeds. The Pt atoms are initially deposited on the vertices
   of a decahedral seed, followed by surface diffusion to other regions
   along the edges/ridges and then across the faces. Different from the
   coating of a Pd icosahedral seed, the Pt atoms prefer to stay at the
   vertices and edges/ridges of a decahedral seed even when the deposition
   is conducted at 200 degrees C, naturally generating a core shell
   structure covered by concave facets. The nonuniformity in the Pt coating
   can be attributed to the presence of twin boundaries at the vertices, as
   well as the \{100\} facets and twin defects along the edges/ridges of a
   decahedron, effectively trapping the Pt adatoms at these high-energy
   sites. As compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst, the Pd@Pt concave
   decahedra show substantial enhancement in both catalytic activity and
   durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For the concave
   decahedra with 29.6\% Pt by weight, their specific (1.66 mA/cm(pt)(2))
   and mass (1.60 A/mg/0 ORR activities are enhanced by 4.4 and 6.6 times
   relative to those of the Pt/C catalyst (0.36 mA/cm(pt)(2) and 0.32
   A/mgpt, respectively). After 10 000 cycles of accelerated durability
   test, the concave decahedra still exhibit a mass activity of 0.69
   A/mgpt, more than twice that of the pristine Pt/C catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) simultaneously provides illumination
   and communication via light emitting diodes (LEDs). Keeping a low bit
   error rate is essential to communication quality, and holding a stable
   brightness level is pivotal for illumination function. For the first
   time, a piezo-phototronic effect controlled visible light communication
   (PVLC) system based on InGaN/GaN multiquantum wells nanopillars is
   demonstrated, in which the information is coded by mechanical straining.
   This approach of force coding is also instrumental to avoid LED blinks,
   which has less impact on illumination and is much safer to eyes than
   electrical on/off VLC. The two-channel transmission mode of the system
   here shows great superiority in error self-validation and error
   self-elimination in comparison to VLC. This two-channel PVLC system
   provides a suitable way to carry out noncontact, reliable communication
   under complex circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Product design stage has a profound impact on a product's carbon
   footprint in its life cycle. Existing low-carbon design approaches are
   either not able to achieve low-carbon design solutions in product life
   cycle or prone to a loss of optimal solutions with the consideration of
   product life cycle. At each stage of product life cycle, there are
   several alternative design solutions, which can provide extra design
   space and bring more opportunities for low-carbon design. In this paper,
   a feature-based carbon footprint element model is proposed to estimate
   the carbon footprint at each stage of product life cycle. A five-layer
   weighted directed graph-based life cycle decision space is also proposed
   to represent the alternative life cycle paths. The low-carbon design
   process is to search the design solution with the lowest carbon
   footprint based on the mapping between design solution space and life
   cycle decision space. The proposed design process is to provide an
   integrated approach to enumerate and combine alternative solutions at
   each stage of product life cycle. The low-carbon design of a cold
   heading machine is given as an example to demonstrate the design
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Relative orbital elements provide a geometric interpretation of the
   motion of a deputy spacecraft about a chief spacecraft. The formulation
   yields an intuitive understanding of how the relative motion evolves
   with time, and by incorporating velocity changes in the local-vertical,
   local-horizontal component directions, the change in relative motion due
   to impulsive maneuvers can be evaluated. This paper utilizes a relative
   orbital element formulation that characterizes relative motion where the
   chief spacecraft is assumed to be in a circular orbit. Expressions are
   developed for changes to the relative orbital elements as a function of
   the impulsive maneuver components in each coordinate direction. A
   general maneuver strategy is developed for targeting a set of relative
   orbital elements, and this strategy is applied to scenarios that are
   relevant for close proximity operations, including establishing a
   stationary relative orbit, natural motion circumnavigation, and
   station-keeping in a leading or trailing orbit.}},

Abstract = {{We present an application of the digital image correlation (DIC) method

   technique through displacement and strain analysis on amorphous silicon.
   Two types of error sources resulting from the transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) image noise and electromagnetic-lens distortions are
   quantitatively investigated via rigid-body translation experiments. The
   local and global DIC approaches are applied for the analysis of
   diffusion-and reaction-induced deformation fields in electrochemically

Title = {{Measuring fluid flow and heat output in seafloor hydrothermal

Abstract = {{We review techniques for measuring fluid flow and advective heat output
   from seafloor hydrothermal systems and describe new anemometer and
   turbine flowmeter devices we have designed, built, calibrated, and
   tested. These devices allow measuring fluid velocity at high-and
   low-temperature focused and diffuse discharge sites at oceanic spreading
   centers. The devices perform at ocean floor depths and black smoker
   temperatures and can be used to measure flow rates ranging over 2 orders
   of magnitude. Flow velocity is determined from the rotation rate of the
   rotor blades or paddle assembly. These devices have an open bearing
   design that eliminates clogging by particles or chemical precipitates as
   the fluid passes by the rotors. The devices are compact and lightweight
   enough for deployment from either an occupied or remotely operated
   submersible. The measured flow rates can be used in conjunction with
   vent temperature or geochemical measurements to obtain heat outputs or
   geochemical fluxes from both vent chimneys and diffuse flow regions. The
   devices have been tested on 30 Alvin dives on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and
   3 Jason dives on the East Pacific Rise (EPR). We measured an anomalously
   low entrainment coefficient (0.064) and report 104 new measurements over
   a wide range of discharge temperatures (5 degrees-363 degrees C),
   velocities (2-199 cm/s), and depths (1517-2511 m). These include the
   first advective heat output measurements at the High Rise vent field and
   the first direct fluid flow measurement at Middle Valley. Our data
   suggest that black smoker heat output at the Main Endeavour vent field
   may have declined since 1994 and that after the 2005-2006 eruption, the
   high-temperature advective flow at the EPR 9 degrees 50'N field may have
   become more channelized, predominately discharging through the Bio 9
   structure. We also report 16 measurements on 10 Alvin dives and 2 Jason
   dives with flow meters that predate devices described in this work and
   were used in the process of their development. This includes the first
   advective measurements in the Lau Basin and at the EPR 9 degrees 39.5'N.
   We discuss potential error sources and how they may affect the accuracy
   of measurements by our devices and other devices. In particular, we use
   the turbulent plume theory to evaluate the effect of entrainment of
   ambient seawater.}},

Title = {{Variability and origin of seismic anisotropy across eastern Canada:
   Evidence from shear wave splitting measurements}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Measurements of seismic anisotropy in continental regions are frequently
   interpreted with respect to past tectonic processes, preserved in the
   lithosphere as ``fossil{''} fabrics. Models of the present-day
   sublithospheric flow (often using absolute plate motion as a proxy) are
   also used to explain the observations. Discriminating between these
   different sources of seismic anisotropy is particularly challenging
   beneath shields, whose thick (>= 200 km) lithospheric roots may record a
   protracted history of deformation and strongly influence underlying
   mantle flow. Eastern Canada, where the geological record spans similar
   to 3 Ga of Earth history, is an ideal region to address this issue. We
   use shear wave splitting measurements of core phases such as SKS to
   define upper mantle anisotropy using the orientation of the
   fast-polarization direction phi and delay time delta t between fast and
   slow shear wave arrivals. Comparison with structural trends in surface
   geology and aeromagnetic data helps to determine the contribution of
   fossil lithospheric fabrics to the anisotropy. We also assess the
   influence of sublithospheric mantle flow via flow directions derived
   from global geodynamic models. Fast-polarization orientations are
   generally ENE-WSW to ESE-WNW across the region, but significant lateral
   variability in splitting parameters on a <= 100 km scale implies a
   lithospheric contribution to the results. Correlations with structural
   geologic and magnetic trends are not ubiquitous, however, nor are
   correlations with geodynamically predicted mantle flow directions. We
   therefore consider that the splitting parameters likely record a
   combination of the present-day mantle flow and older lithospheric
   fabrics. Consideration of both sources of anisotropy is critical in
   shield regions when interpreting splitting observations.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous machine learning algorithms contain pairwise statistical
   problems at their core that is, tasks that require computations over all
   pairs of input points if implemented naively. Often, tree structures are
   used to solve these problems efficiently. Dual-tree algorithms can
   efficiently solve or approximate many of these problems. Using cover
   trees, rigorous worst case runtime guarantees have been proven for some
   of these algorithms. In this paper, we present a problem-independent
   runtime guarantee for any dual-tree algorithm using the cover tree,
   separating out the problem-dependent and the problem-independent
   elements. This allows us to just plug in bounds for the
   problem-dependent elements to get runtime guarantees for dual-tree
   algorithms for any pairwise statistical problem without re-deriving the
   entire proof. We demonstrate this plug-and-play procedure for
   nearest-neighbor search and approximate kernel density estimation to get
   improved runtime guarantees. Under mild assumptions, we also present the
   first linear runtime guarantee for dual-tree based range search.}},

Abstract = {{The hybrid Diffusion-Transport Homogenization (DTH) method has been
   improved by replacing the assembly-level fixed-source calculation step
   with a fixed number of whole-core transport sweeps following each
   homogenization step. Like the unmodified DTH method, the Enhanced hybrid
   Diffusion-Transport Homogenization (EDTH) method adds an ``auxiliary
   cross-section{''} term to the right side of the transport equation in
   order to maintain consistency with the heterogeneous equation. As an
   improvement to the DTH method, the on-the-fly rehomogenization step of
   the EDTH method utilizes a fixed number of full-core transport sweeps in
   lieu of assembly-level fixed-source heterogeneous transport
   calculations. The EDTH method has been tested in one-dimensional reactor
   core benchmark problems typical of a boiling water reactor core, a
   gas-cooled thermal reactor {[}High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR)]
   core, and a pressurized water reactor core with mixed-oxide fuel. The
   method has been shown to reproduce the heterogeneous transport flux
   profile with 0 to 46 pcm eigenvalue error and 0.1\% to 1.8\% mean
   relative flux error with a speedup factor of 1.4 to 4.5 times faster
   than the DTH method. This represents a speedup of 3.0 to 12.5 times
   compared to fine-mesh transport.}},

Abstract = {{Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on large-area graphene and other
   2D materials can potentially be used as low-cost and flexible
   potentiometric biological sensors. However, there have been few attempts
   to use these devices for quantifying molecular interactions and to
   compare their performance to established sensor technology. Here,
   gold-coated graphene FETs are used to measure the binding affinity of a
   specific protein-antibody interaction. Having a gold surface gives
   access to well-known thiol chemistry for the self-assembly of linker
   molecules. The results are compared with potentiometric silicon-based
   extended-gate sensors and a surface plasmon resonance system. The
   estimated dissociation constants are in excellent agreement for all
   sensor types as long as the active surfaces are the same (gold). The
   role of the graphene transducer is to simply amplify surface potential
   changes caused by adsorption of molecules on the gold surface.}},

Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1572-1583}},

Abstract = {{Seasonally dry, water-limited regions are often co-dominated by distinct
   herbaceous and woody plant communities with contrasting ecohydrological
   properties. We investigated the shape of the above-ground net primary
   productivity (ANPP) response to annual precipitation (P-a) for adjacent
   grassland and shrubland ecosystems in Southern California, with the goal
   of understanding the role of these ecohydrological properties on
   ecosystem function. Our synthesis of observations and modelling
   demonstrates grassland and shrubland exhibit distinct ANPP-P-a responses
   that correspond with characteristics of the long-term P-a distribution
   and mean water balance fluxes. For annual grassland, no ANPP occurs
   below a precipitation compensation point,' where bare soil evaporation
   dominates the water balance, and ANPP saturates above the P-a where deep
   percolation and runoff contribute to the modelled water balance. For
   shrubs, ANPP increases at a lower and relatively constant rate across
   the P-a gradient, while deep percolation and runoff account for a
   smaller fraction of the modelled water balance. We identify
   precipitation seasonality, root depth, and water stress sensitivity as
   the main ecosystem properties controlling these responses. Observed
   ANPP-P-a responses correspond to notably different patterns of rain-use
   efficiency (RUE). Grass RUE exceeds shrub RUE over a wide range of
   typical P-a values, whereas grasses and shrubs achieve a similar RUE in
   particularly dry or wet years. Inter-annual precipitation variability,
   and the concomitant effect on ANPP, plays a critical role in maintaining
   the balance of grass and shrub cover and ecosystem-scale productivity
   across this landscape. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic methodology for characterizing a novel and newly fabricated
   high-flux solar simulator is presented. The high-flux solar simulator
   consists of seven xenon short-arc lamps mounted in truncated ellipsoidal
   reflectors. Characterization of spatial radiative heat flux distribution
   was performed using calorimetric measurements of heat flow coupled with
   CCD camera imaging of a Lambertian target mounted in the focal plane.
   The calorimetric measurements and images of the Lambertian target were
   obtained in two separate runs under identical conditions. Detailed
   modeling in the high-flux solar simulator was accomplished using Monte
   Carlo ray tracing to capture radiative heat transport. A least-squares
   regression model was used on the Monte Carlo radiative heat transfer
   analysis with the experimental data to account for manufacturing
   defects. The Monte Carlo ray tracing was calibrated by regressing
   modeled radiative heat flux as a function of specular error and electric
   power to radiation conversion onto measured radiative heat flux from
   experimental results. Specular error and electric power to radiation
   conversion efficiency were 5.92 +/- 0.05 mrad and 0.537 +/- 0.004,
   respectively. An average radiative heat flux with 95\% errors bounds of
   4880 +/- 223 kW . m(-2) was measured over a 40 mm diameter with a
   cavity-type calorimeter with an apparent absorptivity of 0.994. The
   Monte Carlo ray-tracing resulted in an average radiative heat flux of
   893.3 kW . m(-2) for a single lamp, comparable to the measured radiative
   heat fluxes with 95\% error bounds of 892.5 +/- 105.3 kW . m(-2) from
   calorimetry. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Modern seismic sensors are capable of recording high precision vibration
   data continuously for several months. Seismic raw data consists of
   information regarding earthquake's origin time, location, wave velocity,
   etc. Currently, these high volume data are gathered manually from each
   station for analysis. This process restricts us from obtaining
   high-resolution images in real-time. A new in-network distributed method
   is required that can obtain a high-resolution seismic tomography in real
   time. In this paper, we present a distributed multigrid solution to
   reconstruct seismic image over large dense networks. The algorithm
   performs in-network computation on large seismic samples and avoids
   expensive data collection and centralized computation. Our evaluation
   using synthetic data shows that the proposed method accelerates the
   convergence and reduces the number of messages exchanged. The
   distributed scheme balances the computation load and is also tolerant to
   severe packet loss.}},

Abstract = {{We develop diffusion approximations for parallel-queueing systems with
   the randomized longest-queue-first scheduling (LQF) algorithm by
   establishing new mean-field limit theorems as the number of buffers n ->
   infinity. We achieve this by allowing the number of sampled buffers d =
   d(n) to depend on the number of buffers n, which yields an asymptotic
   `decoupling' of the queue length processes. We show through simulation
   experiments that the resulting approximation is accurate even for
   moderate values of n and d(n). To the best of the authors' knowledge,
   this is the first derivation of diffusion approximations for a queueing
   system in the large-buffer mean-field regime. Another noteworthy feature
   of our scaling idea is that the randomized LQF algorithm emulates the
   LQF algorithm, yet is computationally more attractive. The analysis of
   the system performance as a function of d(n) is facilitated by the
   multi-scale nature in our limit theorems: the various processes we study
   have different space scalings. This allows us to show the trade-off
   between performance and complexity of the randomized LQF scheduling
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: High prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) along with the poor
   health outcomes and the escalated costs of treatment and care poses the
   need to focus on prevention, early detection and improved management of
   the disease. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the latest
   accomplishments in sensors for glucose and lifestyle monitoring along
   with clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) facilitating self-disease
   management and supporting healthcare professionals in decision making.
   Methods: A critical literature review analysis is conducted focusing on
   advances in: 1) sensors for physiological and lifestyle monitoring, 2)
   models and molecular biomarkers for predicting the onset and assessing
   the progress of DM, and 3) modeling and control methods for regulating
   glucose levels. Results: Glucose and lifestyle sensing technologies are
   continuously evolving with current research focusing on the development
   of noninvasive sensors for accurate glucose monitoring. A wide range of
   modeling, classification, clustering, and control approaches have been
   deployed for the development of the CDSS for diabetes management.
   Sophisticated multiscale, multilevel modeling frameworks taking into
   account information from behavioral down to molecular level are
   necessary to reveal correlations and patterns indicating the onset and
   evolution of DM. Conclusion: Integration of data originating from
   sensor-based systems and electronic health records combined with smart
   data analytics methods and powerful user centered approaches enable the
   shift toward preventive, predictive, personalized, and participatory
   diabetes care. Significance: The potential of sensing and predictive
   modeling approaches toward improving diabetes management is highlighted
   and related challenges are identified.}},

Title = {{Large-Scale Multi-Stream Quickest Change Detection via Shrinkage
   Post-Change Estimation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{6926-6938}},

Abstract = {{The quickest change detection problem is considered in the context of
   monitoring large-scale independent normal distributed data streams with
   possible changes in some of the means. It is assumed that for each
   individual local data stream, either there are no local changes, or
   there is a big local change that is larger than a pre-specified lower
   bound. Two different types of scenarios are studied: one is the sparse
   post-change case when the unknown number of affected data streams is
   much smaller than the total number of data streams, and the other is
   when all local data streams are affected simultaneously although not
   necessarily identically. We propose a systematic approach to develop
   efficient global monitoring schemes for quickest change detection by
   combining hard thresholding with linear shrinkage estimators to
   estimating all post-change parameters simultaneously. Our theoretical
   analysis demonstrates that the shrinkage estimation can balance the
   tradeoff between the first-order and second-order terms of the
   asymptotic expression on the detection delays, and our numerical
   simulation studies illustrate the usefulness of shrinkage estimation and
   the challenge of Monte Carlo simulation of the average run length to
   false alarm in the context of online monitoring large-scale data
   streams.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an imaging modality that holds strong
   potential for rapid cancer detection during image-guided surgery. But
   the data from HSI often needs to be processed appropriately in order to
   extract the maximum useful information that differentiates cancer from
   normal tissue. We proposed a framework for hyperspectral image
   processing and quantification, which includes a set of steps including
   image preprocessing, glare removal, feature extraction, and ultimately
   image classification. The framework has been tested on images from mice
   with head and neck cancer, using spectra from 450-to 900-nm wavelength.
   The image analysis computed Fourier coefficients, normalized
   reflectance, mean, and spectral derivatives for improved accuracy. The
   experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the hyperspectral
   image processing and quantification framework for cancer detection
   during animal tumor surgery, in a challenging setting where sensitivity
   can be low due to a modest number of features present, but potential for
   fast image classification can be high. This HSI approach may have
   potential application in tumor margin assessment during image-guided
   surgery, where speed of assessment may be the dominant factor. (C) 2015

   with sorbate spray and 5 days for those with ES sorbate. In all cases,
   ES delayed the onset of mold and subsequent growth as compared with

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Mice are commonly used to study conventional outflow
   physiology. This study examined how physical factors (hydration,
   temperature, and anterior chamber {[}AC] deepening) influence ocular
   perfusion measurements in mice.
   METHODS. Outflow facility (C) and pressure-independent outflow (Fu) were
   assessed by multilevel constant pressure perfusion of enucleated eyes
   from C57BL/6 mice. To examine the effect of hydration, seven eyes were
   perfused at room temperature, either immersed to the limbus in saline
   and covered with wet tissue paper or exposed to room air. Temperature
   effects were examined in 12 eyes immersed in saline at 20 degrees C or
   35 degrees C. Anterior chamber deepening was examined in 10 eyes with
   the cannula tip placed in the anterior versus posterior chamber (PC).
   Posterior bowing of the iris (AC deepening) was visualized by
   three-dimensional histology in perfusion-fixed C57BL/6 eyes and by
   spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in living CD1 mice.
   RESULTS. Exposure to room air did not significantly affect C, but led to
   a nonzero Fu that was significantly reduced upon immersion in saline.
   Increasing temperature from 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C increased C by
   2.5-fold, more than could be explained by viscosity changes alone
   (1.4-fold). Perfusion via the AC, but not the PC, led to posterior iris
   bowing and increased outflow.
   CONCLUSIONS. Insufficient hydration contributes to the appearance of
   pressure-independent outflow in enucleated mouse eyes. Despite the large
   lens, AC deepening may artifactually increase outflow in mice.
   Temperature-dependent metabolic processes appear to influence
   conventional outflow regulation. Physical factors should be carefully
   controlled in any outflow studies involving mice.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a mathematical model for planning and scheduling staff and
   demand, considering a time window for ontime demand fulfillment, as well
   as individual staff characteristics, preferences, and availability. We
   also discuss a version where the staff schedule is fixed. The model can
   be applied in many service settings, such as warehouses, fulfillment
   centers, and back-office services. We develop a user-friendly
   decision-support tool that employs the model and the solution
   methodology, and we implement it in a healthcare back-office services
   provider, considering additional operational practices of this company,
   such as team leader scheduling. We conduct a computational study to
   develop insights regarding the tradeoffs between the on-time demand
   fulfillment and the quality of the staff schedule, the effect of a
   change in the demand fulfillment time window, the impact of client
   behavior ( e.g., batch arrivals of demand), and the consequences of
   considering additional preferences and operational constraints. We also
   evaluate the robustness of the staff schedule generated by the model
   under different demand scenarios. Finally, we present a heuristic to set
   high-quality staff schedules quickly. After the implementation, the
   company reported a 25\% increase in staff productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Regional air quality models are widely used to evaluate control strategy
   effectiveness. As such, it is important to understand the accuracy of
   model simulations to establish confidence in model performance and to
   guide further model development. Particulate matter with aerodynamic
   diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is regulated as one of the criteria
   pollutants by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and
   PM2.5 concentrations have a complex dependence on the emissions of a
   number of precursors, including SO2, NOR, NH3, VOCs, and primary
   particulate matter (PM). This study quantifies how the
   emission-associated uncertainties affect modeled PM2.5 concentrations
   and sensitivities using a reduced-form approach. This approach is
   computationally efficient compared to the traditional Monte Carlo
   simulation. The reduced-form model represents the concentration-emission
   response and is constructed using first- and second-order sensitivities
   obtained from a single CMAQ/HDDM-PM simulation. A case study is
   conducted in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area. The uncertainty
   of modeled, daily average PM2.5 concentrations due to uncertain
   emissions is estimated to fall between 42\% and 52\% for different
   simulated concentration levels, and the uncertainty is evenly
   distributed in the modeling domain. Emission-associated uncertainty can
   account for much of the difference between simulation and ground
   measurements as 60\% of observed PM2.5 concentrations fall within the
   range of one standard deviation of corresponding simulated PM2.5
   concentrations. Uncertainties in meteorological fields as well as the
   model representation of secondary organic aerosol formation are the
   other two key contributors to the uncertainty of modeled PM2.5. This
   study also investigates the uncertainties of the simulated first-order
   sensitivities, and found that the larger the first-order sensitivity,
   the lower its uncertainty associated with emissions. Sensitivity of
   PM2.5 to primary PM has the lowest uncertainty while sensitivity of
   PM2.5 to VOC has the highest uncertainty associated with emission
   inputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel dual-band, dual-polarized, miniaturized and
   low-profile base station antenna operating in the frequency bands of
   820-960 and 1710-2170 MHz is designed. Elements are arranged such that
   high-frequency elements are embedded in low frequency elements to reduce
   volume. A baffle is used to reflect the transmitted power density in the
   forward direction and also improve isolation between elements.
   Therefore, surrounding isolation baffles and rectangular baffles are
   appended around high-frequency elements and low-frequency elements,
   respectively. The diameter of the proposed antenna cover is only 200 mm,
   which is smaller than the existing antenna diameter of 280 mm. Compared
   with the other commonly used antennas, the proposed antenna also has
   some advantages such as concealment and low profile using a tubular form
   of radome, which can easily integrate the proposed antenna with the
   surrounding environment. The measured results verify that the proposed
   antenna meets the stringent design requirements: voltage standing wave
   ratio (VSWR) is less than 1.3, the isolation is greater than 30 dB, and
   the pattern parameters also meet telecommunications industry standards.}},

   order to examine internal negative feedback effects, basic

   degeneration resistors, are utilized. A Wilson current mirror and a
   Wilson mirror with its intrinsic external feedback removed are used to
   study external negative feedback effects under the influence of
   laser-induced single events. The measurement data clearly show notable
   improvements in SET response that can be made by employing both internal
   and external negative feedback. The peak transient in the output current
   is reduced, and the settling time upon a laser strike is shortened
   significantly by negative feedback. All four investigated current
   mirrors were fabricated with IBM 8HP 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology.}},

   the use of these devices in a core analog/RF circuit block. The analysis
   includes the use of floating body (FB) and body-connected (BC) devices.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates single-event effects in a W-Band (75-110 GHz)
   SiGe HBT down-conversion mixer intended for use in a space-based remote
   sensing radar system. Transient pulse propagation to the output of the
   mixer as a linear time variant system is analyzed theoretically. This
   study facilitates the understanding of transient propagation in RF
   receivers. Device- and circuit-level simulations were conducted to
   verify the results of the proposed theory. A two photon absorption laser
   was used to induce transients on different SiGe HBTs within the circuit
   to assess the impact of SETs on performance. This study shows that
   significant transients can be produced at the output of the mixer, which
   can potentially corrupt the received data or received pulse of the
   radar. It is shown that a differential double-balanced structure can
   effectively eliminate some of the transients at the output of the mixer.
   To the authors' best knowledge this is the first study of single event
   transients conducted on a millimeter-wave SiGe circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Since their earliest days, humans have been struggling with infectious
   diseases. Caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, or even higher
   organisms,like worms, these diseases depend critically on numerous
   intricate interactions between parasites and hosts, and while we have
   learned much about these interactions, many details are still obscure.
   It is evident that the combined host-parasite dynamics constitutes a
   complex system that involves components and processes at multiple scales
   of time, space, and biological organization. At one end of this
   hierarchy we know of individual molecules that play crucial roles for
   the survival of a parasite or for the response and survival of its host.
   At the other end, one realizes that the spread of infectious diseases by
   far exceeds specific locales and, due to today's easy travel of hosts
   carrying a multitude of organisms, can quickly reach global proportions.
   The community of mathematical modelers has been addressing specific
   aspects of infectious diseases for a long time. Most of these efforts
   have focused on one or two select scales of a multi-level disease and
   used quite different computational approaches. This restriction to a
   molecular, physiological, or epidemiological level was prudent, as it
   has produced solid pillars of a foundation from which it might
   eventually be possible to launch comprehensive, multi-scale modeling
   efforts that make full use of the recent advances in biology and, in
   particular, the various high-throughput methodologies accompanying the
   emerging -omics revolution. This special issue contains contributions
   from biologists and modelers, most of whom presented and discussed their
   work at the workshop From within Host Dynamics to the Epidemiology of
   Infectious Disease, which was held at the Mathematical Biosciences
   Institute at Ohio State University in April 2014. These contributions
   highlight some of the forays into a deeper understanding of the dynamics
   between parasites and their hosts, and the consequences of this dynamics
   for the spread and treatment of infectious diseases. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{High-throughput, genome-scale data present a unique opportunity to link
   host to pathogen on a molecular level. Forging such connections will
   help drive the development of mathematical models to better understand
   and predict both pathogen behavior and the epidemiology of infectious
   diseases, including malaria. However, the datasets that can aid in
   identifying these links and models are vast and not amenable to simple,
   reductionist, and univariate analyses. These datasets require data
   mining in order to identify the truly important measurements that best
   describe clinical and molecular observations. Moreover, these datasets
   typically have relatively few samples due to experimental limitations
   (particularly for human studies or in vivo animal experiments), making
   data mining extremely difficult. Here, after first providing a brief
   overview of common strategies for data reduction and identification of
   relationships between variables for inclusion in mathematical models, we
   present a new generalized strategy for performing these data reduction
   and relationship inference tasks. Our approach emphasizes the importance
   of robustness when using data to drive model development, particularly
   when using genome-scale, small-sample in vivo data. We identify the use
   of appropriate feature reduction combined with data permutations and
   subsampling strategies as being critical to enable increasingly robust
   results from network inference using high-dimensional, low-observation
   data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{270}},
Number = {{B}},
Pages = {{224-236}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Malaria is an infectious disease present all around the globe and
   responsible for half a million deaths per year. A within-host model of
   this infection requires a framework capable of properly approximating
   not only the blood stage of the infection but also the erythropoietic
   process that is in charge of overcoming the malaria induced anemia.
   Within this context, we compare ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
   with and without age classes, delayed differential equations (DDEs), and
   discrete recursive equations (DREs) with age classes. Results show that
   ODEs without age classes are fair approximations that do not provide a
   crisp temporal representation of the processes involved, and inclusion
   of age classes only mitigates the problem to some degree. DDEs perform
   well with respect to generating the essentially fixed delay between cell
   production and cell removal due to age, but the inclusion of any other
   processes, such as sudden blood loss, becomes cumbersome. The framework
   that was found to perform best in representing the dynamics of red blood
   cells during malaria infection is a DRE with age classes. In this model
   structure, the amount of time a cell remains alive is easily controlled,
   and the addition of age dependent or independent processes is
   straightforward. All events that populations of cells face during their
   lifespan, like growth or adaptation in differentiation or maturation
   rate, are properly represented in this framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present finite element simulation results of the
   transient stress response of an AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistor (HEMT). The modeling technique involves a small-scale
   electro-thermal model coupled to a large-scale mechanics model to
   determine the resulting stress distribution within a device operated
   under radio frequency (RF) conditions. The electrical characteristics of
   the modeled device were compared to experimental measurements and
   existing simulation data from literature for validation. The results
   show critical regions around the gate Schottky contact undergo
   drastically different transient stresses during pulsed operation.
   Specifically, stress profiles within the AlGaN layer around the gate
   foot print (GFP) undergo highly tensile electrothermal stresses while
   stresses within the AlGaN outside the gate connected field plate (GCFP)
   towards the drain contact undergo highly tensile electrical stress and
   compressive thermoelastic stress. It is shown AlGaN/GaN HEMTs undergo
   large amounts of cyclic loading during typical transient operation.
   Based on these findings, transient failure mechanisms may differ from
   those previously studied under DC operation due to large amount of
   cyclic loading of a device around the gate structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   core-shell nanowire (NW) structures can realize a type of high electron
   mobility transistor structure in one-dimensional NWs by separating the
   carrier transport region from the impurity-doped region. Precise
   analysis, using Raman spectroscopy of the Ge optical phonon peak, can
   distinguish three effects: the phonon confinement effect, the stress
   effect due to the heterostructures, and the Farm effect. The Fano effect
   is the most important to demonstrate hole gas accumulation in Ge/Si
   core-shell NWs. Using these techniques, we obtained conclusive evidence
   of the hole gas accumulation in Ge/Si core-shell NWs. The control of
   hole gas concentration can be realized by changing the B-doping
   concentration in the Si shell.}},

Abstract = {{We report a hybridized nanogenerator including a triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) and six electromagnetic generators (EMGs) that can
   effectively scavenge biomechanical energy for sustainably powering an
   electronic watch. Triggered by the natural motions of the wearer's
   wrist, a magnetic ball at the center in an acrylic box with coils on
   each side will collide with the walls, resulting in outputs from both
   the EMGs and the TENG. By using the hybridized nanogenerator to harvest
   the biomechanical energy, the electronic watch can be continuously
   powered under different motion types of the wearer's wrist, where the
   best approach is to charge a 100 mu F capacitor in 39s to maintain the
   continuous operation of the watch for 456 s. To increase the working
   time of the watch further, a homemade Li-ion battery has been utilized
   as the energy storage unit for realizing the continuous working of the
   watch for about 218 min by using the hybridized nanogenerator to charge
   the battery within 32 min. This work will provide the opportunities for
   developing a nanogenerator-based built-in power source for self-powered
   wearable electronics such as an electronic watch.}},

Abstract = {{Although the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been proven to be a
   renewable and effective route for ambient energy harvesting, its
   robustness remains a great challenge due to the requirement of surface
   friction for a decent output, especially for the in-plane sliding mode
   TENG. Here, we present a rationally designed TENG for achieving a high
   output performance without compromising the device robustness by, first,
   converting the in-plane sliding electrification into a contact
   separation working mode and, second, creating an automatic transition
   between a contact working state and a noncontact working state. The
   magnet-assisted automatic transition triboelectric nanogenerator
   (AT-TENG) was demonstrated to effectively harness various ambient
   rotational motions to generate electricity with greatly improved device
   robustness. At a wind speed of 6.5 m/s or a water flow rate of 5.5
   L/min, the harvested energy was capable of lighting up 24 spot lights
   (0.6 W each) simultaneously and charging a capacitor to greater than 120
   V in 60 s. Furthermore, due to the rational structural design and unique
   output characteristics, the AT-TENG was not only capable of harvesting
   energy from natural bicycling and car motion but also acting as a
   self-powered speedometer with ultrahigh accuracy. Given such features as
   structural simplicity, easy fabrication, low cost, wide applicability
   even in a harsh environment, and high output performance with superior
   device robustness, the AT-TENG renders an effective and practical
   approach for ambient mechanical energy harvesting as well as
   self-powered active sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Research in the rapidly developing field of 2D electronic materials has
   thus far been focused on metallic and semiconducting materials. However,
   complementary dielectric materials such as nonlinear dielectrics are
   needed to enable realistic device architectures. Candidate materials
   require tunable dielectric properties and pathways for heterostructure
   assembly. Here we report on a family of cation-deficient transition
   metal thiophosphates whose unique chemistry makes them a viable prospect
   for these applications. In these materials, naturally occurring
   ferrielectric heterostructures composed of centrosymmetric In4/3P2S6 and
   ferrielectrically active CuInP2S6 are realized by controllable chemical
   phase separation in van der Waals bonded single crystals. CuInP2S6 by
   itself is a layered ferrielectric with a ferrielectric transition
   temperature (T-c) just over room temperature, which rapidly decreases
   with homogeneous doping. Surprisingly, in our composite materials, the
   ferrielectric T-c of the polar CuInP2S6 phase increases. This effect is
   enabled by unique spinodal decomposition that retains the overall van
   der Waals layered morphology of the crystal, but chemically separates
   CuInP2S6 and In4/3P2S6 within each layer. The average spatial
   periodicity of the distinct chemical phases can be finely controlled by
   altering the composition and/or synthesis conditions. One intriguing
   prospect for such layered spinodal alloys is large volume synthesis of
   2D in-plane heterostructures with periodically alternating polar and
   nonpolar phases.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate matter (PM) pollution from automobile exhaust has become one
   of the main pollution sources in urban environments. Although the diesel
   particulate filter has been used in heavy diesel vehicles, there is no
   particulate filter for most gasoline cars or light-duty vehicles because
   of high cost. Here, we introduce a self-powered triboelectric filter for
   removing PMs from automobile exhaust fumes using the
   triboelectrification effect. The finite element simulation reveals that
   the collision or friction between PTFE pellets and electrodes can
   generate large triboelectric charges and form a space electric field as
   high as 12 MV/m, accompanying an open-circuit voltage of similar to 6 kV
   between the two electrodes, which is comparable to the measured value of
   3 kV. By controlling the vibration frequency and fill ratio of pellets,
   more than 94\% PMs in aerosol can be removed using the high electric
   field in the triboelectric filter. In real automobile exhaust fumes, the
   triboelectic filter has a mass collection efficiency of similar to
   95.5\% for PM2.5 using self-vibration of the tailpipe.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean waves are one of the most abundant energy sources on earth, but
   harvesting such energy is rather challenging due to various limitations
   of current technologies. Recently, networks formed by triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) have been proposed as a promising technology for
   harvesting water wave energy. In this work, a basic unit for the TENG
   network was studied and optimized, which has a box structure composed of
   walls made of TENG composed of a wavy-structured Cu-Kapton-Cu film and
   two FEP thin films, with a metal ball enclosed inside. By combination of
   the theoretical calculations and experimental studies, the output
   performances of the TENG unit were investigated for various structural
   parameters, such as the size, mass, or number of the metal balls. From
   the viewpoint of theory, the output characteristics of TENG during its

Abstract = {{The dynamic reconfiguration of two-dimensional (2D) magneto-elastic
   structures is studied with the goal of enabling the design of
   reconfigurable architectured materials. Changes in magnetization modify
   the energy landscape of hexagonal lattices and lead to their
   reconfiguration as a result of the application of a dynamic input. Such
   reconfiguration significantly alters the dynamics of the structure and
   its mechanical properties. Energy landscapes and the dynamics of
   reconfiguration are analyzed through the detailed study of a unit cell
   and the description of loci of equilibrium within the energy landscape,
   as well as numerical simulations on finite lattices undergoing
   reconfiguration. Results show the occurrence of a transition front
   propagating within the 2D structures according to a triangular pattern
   bounded by transition bands that separate different orientation domains
   within the structure. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences. Published by

Abstract = {{An insect's eyes may make up to 40\% of its body's surface, and are in
   danger of being coated by foreign particles such as dust and pollen. To
   protect them, several insect species possess an array of ocular hairs
   evenly spaced between each photoreceptor unit. Although these hairs have
   been observed for over 50 years, their purpose remains a mystery. In
   this study, we elucidate the function of ocular hairs using a
   combination of experiments, numerical simulation and micro-fabrication.
   We measure the eyes of 18 species of insects and find that the length of
   their ocular hairs is equal to their spacing. We conduct wind tunnel
   experiments using both an insect eye mimic and an at-scale fabricated
   micro-pillar array of the same dimensions as the insect eye. Our
   experiments and simulations show that ocular hairs reduce airflow at the
   eye surface by up to 90\%. We conclude that ocular hairs act similarly
   to mammalian eyelashes: as insects fly, ocular hairs deflect incoming
   air and create a zone of stagnant air. Airflow and particle deposition
   are reduced dramatically, while light is only minimally occluded.
   Micro-scale ocular hairs may find application in the deployment of
   sensors outdoors, for which accumulation of airborne dust and pollen has
   no current solution.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-inspired hydrodynamic thrust generation using piezoelectric
   transduction has recently been explored using Macro-Fiber Composite
   (MFC) actuators. The MFC technology strikes a balance between the
   actuation force and structural deformation levels for effective swimming
   performance, and additionally offers geometric scalability, silent
   operation, and ease of fabrication. Recently we have shown that mean
   thrust levels comparable to biological fish of similar size can be
   achieved using MFC fins. The present work investigates the effect of
   length-to-width (L/b) aspect ratio on the hydrodynamic thrust generation
   performance of MFC cantilever fins by accounting for the power
   consumption level. It is known that the hydrodynamic inertia and drag
   coefficients are controlled by the aspect ratio especially for L/b < 5.
   The three MFC bimorph fins explored in this work have the aspect ratios
   of 2.1, 3.9, and 5.4. A nonlinear electrohydroelastic model is employed
   to extract the inertia and drag coefficients from the vibration response
   to harmonic actuation for the first bending mode. Experiments are then
   conducted for various actuation voltage levels to quantify the mean
   thrust resultant and power consumption levels for different aspect
   ratios. Variation of the thrust coefficient of the MFC bimorph fins with
   changing aspect ratio is also semi-empirically modeled and presented.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a new process for strengthening natural silk
   fibers. This process is simple yet effective for mass production of high
   strength silk fibers, enabled by drawing at a lower temperature and
   immediately heat setting at a higher temperature. The processing
   conditions were investigated and optimized to improve the strength. Silk
   fibers drawn to the maximum ratio at room temperature and then heat set
   at 200 degrees C show best tensile properties. Some salient features of
   the resulting fibers are tensile strength at break reaching 533 +/- 10.2
   MPa and Young's modulus attaining 12.9 +/- 0.57 GPa. These values are
   significantly higher than those of natural silk fibers (tensile strength
   increased by 44 \% and Young's modulus by 135 \%). Wide-angle X-ray
   diffraction and FTIR confirm the transformation of silk I to silk II
   crystalline structure for the fiber obtained from this process. DSC and

Abstract = {{In distributed self-assembly, a multitude of agents seek to form copies
   of a particular structure, modeled here as a labeled graph. In the
   model, agents encounter each other in spontaneous pairwise interactions
   and decide whether or not to form or sever edges based on their two
   labels and a fixed set of local interaction rules described by a graph
   grammar. The objective is to converge on a graph with a maximum number
   of copies of a given target graph. Our main result is the introduction
   of a simple algorithm that achieves an asymptotically maximum yield in a
   probabilistic sense. Notably, agents do not need to update their labels
   except when forming or severing edges. This contrasts with certain
   existing approaches that exploit information propagating rules,
   effectively addressing the decision problem at the level of subgraphs as
   opposed to individual vertices. We are able to obey more stringent
   locality requirements while also providing smaller rule sets. The
   results can be improved upon if certain requirements on the labels are
   relaxed. We discuss limits of performance in self-assembly in terms of
   rule set characteristics and achievable maximum yield.}},

Abstract = {{The design and planning of major storage systems belong to the class of
   systems design problems under uncertainty. The overall structure of the
   system is determined during the design stage while the values of the
   future conditions and the future planning decisions are not known with
   certainty. Typically the future uncertainty is modeled through a number
   of scenarios and each scenario has an individual time-discounted total
   system cost. The overall performance of the material handling system
   (MHS) is characterized by the distribution of these scenario costs. The
   central tendency of the cost distribution is always computed as the
   expected value of the distribution. Several alternatives for the
   dispersion of the distribution can be used. In this study the standard
   deviation, variance, and the downside risk of the cost distribution are
   investigated as the risk measures of the system. We propose an algorithm
   to efficiently identify all configurations of the MHS that are
   Pareto-optimal with respect to the tradeoff between the expected value
   of the costs and the risk; such Pareto-optimal configurations are also
   called efficient. Although the MHS model has non-linear constraints, our
   proposed algorithm can solve such non-linear models taking into account
   both the expected costs and the risk. The final selection of the storage
   system for implementation can then be made based on the Pareto graph and
   other considerations such as the risk preferences of the system owner.
   The algorithms developed are illustrated through a case study which
   helps in developing business insights for the warehouse and MHS design
   planners and decision makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{How does long-term training affect the neural control of movements? Here
   we tested the hypothesis that long-term training leading to skilled
   motor performance alters muscle coordination during challenging, as well
   as nominal everyday motor behaviors. Using motor module (a.k.a., muscle
   synergy) analyses, we identified differences in muscle coordination
   patterns between professionally trained ballet dancers (experts) and
   untrained novices that accompanied differences in walking balance
   proficiency assessed using a challenging beam-walking test. During beam
   walking, we found that experts recruited more motor modules than
   novices, suggesting an increase in motor repertoire size. Motor modules
   in experts had less muscle coactivity and were more consistent than in
   novices, reflecting greater efficiency in muscle output. Moreover, the
   pool of motor modules shared between beam and overground walking was
   larger in experts compared with novices, suggesting greater
   generalization of motor module function across multiple behaviors. These
   differences in motor output between experts and novices could not be
   explained by differences in kinematics, suggesting that they likely
   reflect differences in the neural control of movement following years of
   training rather than biomechanical constraints imposed by the activity
   or musculoskeletal structure and function. Our results suggest that to
   learn challenging new behaviors, we may take advantage of existing motor
   modules used for related behaviors and sculpt them to meet the demands
   of a new behavior.}},

Title = {{A comprehensive review of Li4Ti5O12-based electrodes for lithium-ion
   batteries: The latest advancements and future perspectives}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING R-REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{1-71}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Advanced electrical energy storage technology is a game changer for a
   clean, sustainable, and secure energy future because efficient
   utilization of newable energy hinges on cost-effect and efficient energy
   storage. Further, the viability of many emerging technologies depends on
   breakthroughs in energy storage technologies, including electric
   vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and smart grids.
   Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a great success in the portable
   electronics sector, are believed also the most promising power sources
   for emerging technologies such as EVs and smart grids. To date, however,
   the existing LIBs (with LiCoOx cathode and graphite anode) are still
   unable to meet the strict requirements for safety, cycling stability,
   and rate capability. The development of advanced anode materials, which
   can overcome the shortcomings of graphite anode (such as formation of
   dendritic lithium during charge and undesirable solid electrolyte
   interface), is of critical importance to enhancing the cycling stability
   and operational safety of LIBs. Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) has
   recently attracted considerable attentions as a potential anode material
   of LIBs for high power applications due to several outstanding features,
   including a flat charge/discharge plateaus (around 1.55 V vs. Li/Li+)
   because of the two-phase lithium insertion/extraction mechanism and
   minimum chance for the formation of SEI and dendritic lithium,
   dramatically enhance the potential for high rate capability and safety.
   In addition, there is almost no volume change during the lithium
   insertion and extraction processes, ensuring a high cycling stability
   and long operational life. However, the electronic conductivity of
   Li4Ti5O12 is relatively low, resulting in large polarization lose, more
   so at higher cycling rates, and poor rate performance. Currently,
   considerable research efforts have been devoted to improving the
   performance of Li4Ti5O12 at fast charge/discharge rates, and some
   important progresses have been made. In this review, we first present a
   general overview of the structural features, thermodynamic properties,
   transport properties, and the electrochemical behavior of Li4Ti5O12
   under typical battery operating conditions. We then provide a
   comprehensive review of the recent advancements made in
   characterization, modification, and applications of Li4Ti5O12 electrodes
   to LIBs, including nanostructuring, surface coating, morphological
   optimization, doping, and rational design of composite electrodes.
   Finally, we highlight the critical challenges facing us today and future
   perspectives for further development of Li4Ti5O12-based electrodes. It
   is hoped that this review may provide some useful guidelines for
   rational design of better electrodes for advanced LIBs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Human biomechanical energy is characterized by fluctuating amplitudes
   and variable low frequency, and an effective utilization of such energy
   cannot be achieved by classical energy-harvesting technologies. Here we
   report a high-efficient self-charging power system for sustainable
   operation of mobile electronics exploiting exclusively human
   biomechanical energy, which consists of a high-output triboelectric
   nanogenerator, a power management circuit to convert the random a.c.
   energy to d.c. electricity at 60\% efficiency, and an energy storage
   device. With palm tapping as the only energy source, this power unit
   provides a continuous d.c. electricity of 1.044mW (7.34 W m(-3)) in a
   regulated and managed manner. This self-charging unit can be universally
   applied as a standard `infinite-lifetime' power source for continuously
   driving numerous conventional electronics, such as thermometers,
   electrocardiograph system, pedometers, wearable watches, scientific

Abstract = {{Although recent studies of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) have

Abstract = {{Rising atmospheric CO2 levels have triggered recent research into the
   science of amine materials supported on hard, porous materials such as
   mesoporous silica or alumina. While such materials can give high CO2
   uptakes and good sorption kinetics, they are difficult to utilize in
   practical applications due to difficulty in contacting large volumes of
   CO2-laden gases with powder materials without significant pressure drops
   or sorbent attrition. Here, we describe a simple approach based on the
   impregnation of a permanently microporous polymer, PIM-1, with
   poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), removing the need for use of the hard oxide.
   PEI/PIM-1 composites demonstrate comparable performance to more
   traditionally studied oxide sorbents, with the benefit that PIM-1 is
   soluble in common solvents, making it eminently more viable for
   processing into morphologies that can facilitate heat and mass transfer
   and fabrication into low pressure drop contactors. In addition to
   adsorption studies performed on a variety of PEI/PIM-1 architectures,
   spin diffusion NMR studies were performed to suggest that PEI is
   well-dispersed within the PIM-1, allowing for rapid CO2 adsorption.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1261-1269}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A key limitation to engineering microbes for chemical production is a
   reliance on low-throughput chromatography-based screens for chemical
   detection. While colorimetric chemicals are amenable to high-throughput
   screens, many value-added chemicals are not colorimetric and require
   sensors for high-throughput screening. Here, we use G-protein coupled
   receptors (GPCRs) known to bind medium-chain fatty acids in mammalian
   cells to rapidly construct chemical sensors in yeast. Medium-chain fatty
   acids are immediate precursors to the advanced biofuel fatty acid methyl
   esters, which can serve as a ``drop-in{''} replacement for D2 diesel.
   One of the sensors detects even-chain C8-C12 fatty acids with a 13- to
   17-fold increase in signal after activation, with linear ranges up to
   250 mu M. Introduction of a synthetic response unit alters both dynamic
   and linear range, improving the sensor response to decanoic acid to a
   30-fold increase in signal after activation, with a linear range up to
   500 mu M. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a whole-cell
   medium-chain fatty acid biosensor, which we envision could be applied to
   the evolutionary engineering of fatty acid-producing microbes. Given the
   affinity of GPCRs for a wide range of chemicals, it should be possible
   to rapidly assemble new biosensors by simply swapping the GPCR sensing
   unit. These sensors should be amenable to a variety of applications that
   require different dynamic and linear ranges, by introducing different
   response units.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1295-1307}},

Abstract = {{Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) have important therapeutic value,
   including as anticancer and antimalarial agents. Because of their
   chemical complexity, therapeutic MIAs, or advanced intermediates
   thereof, are often isolated from the native plants. The microbial
   synthesis of MIAs would allow for the rapid and scalable production of
   complex MIAs and MIA analogues for therapeutic use. Here, we produce the
   modified MIA hydroxystrictosidine from glucose and the monoterpene
   secologanin via a pterin-dependent mono-oxidation strategy.
   Specifically, we engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the
   high-level synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin to mono-oxidize tryptophan
   to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which, after decarboxylation to serotonin, is
   coupled to exogenously fed secologanin to produce
   10-hydroxystrictosidine in an eight-enzyme pathway. We selected
   hydroxystrictosidine as our synthetic target because hydroxylation at
   the 10' position of the alkaloid core strictosidine provides a chemical
   handle for the future chemical semisynthesis of therapeutics. We show
   the generality of the pterin-dependent mono-oxidation strategy for
   alkaloid synthesis by hydroxylating tyrosine to L-DOPA-a key
   intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) biosynthesis-and,
   thereafter, further converting it to dopamine. Together, these results
   present the first microbial synthesis of a modified alkaloid, the first
   production of tetrahydrobiopterin in yeast, and the first use of a
   pterin-dependent mono-oxidation strategy for the synthesis of L-DOPA.
   This work opens the door to the scalable production of MIAs as well as
   the production of modified MIAs to serve as late intermediates in the
   semisynthesis of known and novel therapeutics. Further, the microbial
   strains in this work can be used as plant pathway discovery tools to
   elucidate known MIA biosynthetic pathways or to identify pathways
   leading to novel MIAs.}},

Abstract = {{Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess great potential for neural tissue
   repair after traumatic injuries to the central nervous system (CNS).
   However, poor survival and self-renewal of NSCs after injury severely
   limits its therapeutic potential. Sulfated chondroitin sulfate
   glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) linked to CS proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the
   brain extracellular matrix (ECM) have the ability to bind and potentiate
   trophic factor efficacy, and promote NSC self-renewal in vivo. In this
   study, we investigated the potential of CS-GAG hydrogels composed of
   monosulfated CS-4 (CS-A), CS-6 (CS-C), and disulfated CS-4,6 (CS-E)
   CS-GAGs as NSC carriers, and their ability to create endogenous niches
   by enriching specific trophic factors to support NSC self-renewal. We
   demonstrate that CS-GAG hydrogel scaffolds showed minimal swelling and
   degradation over a period of 15 days in vitro, absorbing only 6.5 +/-
   0.019\% of their initial weight, and showing no significant loss of mass
   during this period. Trophic factors FGF-2, BDNF, and IL10 bound with
   high affinity to CS-GAGs, and were significantly (p <0.05) enriched in
   CS-GAG hydrogels when compared to unsulfated hyaluronic acid (HA)
   hydrogels. Dissociated rat subventricular zone (SVZ) NSCs when
   encapsulated in CS-GAG hydrogels demonstrated similar to 88.5 +/- 6.1\%
   cell viability in vitro. Finally, rat neurospheres in CS-GAG hydrogels
   conditioned with the mitogen FGF-2 demonstrated significantly (p < 0.05)
   higher self-renewal when compared to neurospheres cultured in
   unconditioned hydrogels. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the
   ability of CS-GAG based hydrogels to regulate NSC self-renewal, and
   facilitate growth factor enrichment locally.}},

Abstract = {{Improved understanding of turbulent flames characterized by negative
   consumption speed-based Markstein lengths is necessary to develop better
   models for turbulent lean combustion of high hydrogen content fuels. In
   this paper we investigate the topology and burning rates of turbulent,
   lean (phi = 0.31), H-2/air flames obtained from a recently published DNS
   database (Aspden et al., 2011). We calculate local flame front
   curvatures, strain rates, thicknesses, and burning velocities and
   compare these values to reference quantities obtained from stretched
   laminar flames computed numerically in three model geometrical
   configurations a counterflow twin flame, a tubular counterflow flame and
   an expanding cylindrical flame. We compare and contrast the DNS with
   these model laminar flame calculations, and show both where they closely
   correlate with each other, as well as where they do not. These results
   in the latter case are shown to result from non-flamelet behaviors,
   unsteady effects, and curvature-strain correlations. These insights are
   derived from comparisons conditioned on different topological features,
   such as portions of the flame front with a spherical/cylindrical shape,
   the leading edge of the flame, and portions of the flame front with low
   mean curvature. We also show that reference time scales vary appreciably
   over the flame, and characterizing the relative values of fluid mechanic
   and kinetic time scales by a single value leads to erroneous
   conclusions. For example, there is a two order of magnitude decrease in
   chemical time scales at the leading edge of the front relative to its
   unstretched value. For this reason, the leading edge of the front quite
   closely tracks quasi-steady calculations, even in the lowest Damkohler
   number case, Da(F)similar to 0.005. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute.

Title = {{Cost-Effective Mobile Backhaul Network Using Existing ODN of PONs for
   the 5G Wireless Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An optical distribution network (ODN) sharing scheme to integrate mobile
   backhaul networks with the existing passive optical network (PON)
   systems is proposed and demonstrated. With the ODN sharing scheme, the
   expense of building new fibers for the next-generation fifth-generation
   (5G) mobile backhaul networks can be reduced. As many wavelengths are
   allocated to the already deployed PON systems, there remain limited
   wavelengths for the mobile backhaul systems. Hence, to efficiently
   increase the serving cell sites of the 5G systems, spectral-efficient
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted in the
   mobile backhaul systems. In order to reduce the latency of the system,
   adaptive adjustment of the OFDM signals for different transmission
   distances is averted. The OFDM signals are transmitted only using
   specific available bandwidth. The available bandwidth for each
   wavelength is studied according to the power fading relationship between
   the transmission distances and the chirp induced from signal modulation.
   A proof-of-concept demonstration experiment has been performed. In our
   results, 20.17 Gb/s with a bit error rate (BER) lower than 3.8 x 10(-3)
   was realized with a split ratio of 256 and a 40-km transmission distance
   of the PON ODN. Hence, each wavelength can support about 20, six, and
   two nodes for the IMT-advanced, current Long-Term Evolution-Advanced
   (LTE-A) systems, and the expected 5G systems, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Decision makers are often required to make decisions with incomplete
   information. In order to design decision support systems (DSSs)
   utilizing restrictiveness and guidance to assist decision makers in
   these situations, it is essential to understand how certain
   decision-making strategies are affected by incomplete information. This
   paper presents the results of a simulation measuring the accuracy and
   effort of two heuristic strategies, take-the-best and Tallying,
   alongside two analytic decision-making strategies, weighted-additive and
   equal-weighting, in scenarios with varying levels of total information,
   information imbalance, dispersion, and dominance. Correct decisions were
   determined by the option with the higher overall score from the
   weighted-additive model with full information. Effort was measured as
   counts of elementary information processes required by each strategy to
   make decisions. Multi-and one-way statistical analyses measured the
   effect of total information, information imbalance, dispersion, and
   dominance, on accuracy and effort required for each decision strategy.
   Three principle results were found: 1) context features matching
   naturalistic decision settings result in heuristic strategies being
   closest in accuracy to analytic strategies; 2) the variability in the
   distribution of the effort requirements of the heuristic strategies for
   each level of total information indicates that the effort requirements
   of heuristics may not always be as favorable as prior studies have
   shown; and 3) the tradeoff between information imbalance and total
   information suggests new insight for DSS design of restrictiveness and
   guidance for scenarios with incomplete information.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical and experimental analyses are performed on a supersonic air
   ejector to evaluate the effectiveness of commonly-used computational
   techniques when predicting ejector flow characteristics. Three series of
   experimental curves at different operating conditions are compared with
   2D and 3D simulations using RANS, steady, wall-resolved models. Four
   different turbulence models are tested: k-epsilon, k-epsilon realizable,
   k-omega SST, and the stress-omega Reynolds Stress Model. An extensive
   analysis is performed to interpret the differences between numerical and
   experimental results. The results show that while differences between
   turbulence models are typically small with respect to the prediction of
   global parameters such as ejector inlet mass flow rates and Mass
   Entrainment Ratio (MER), the k-omega SST model generally performs best
   whereas epsilon-based models are more accurate at low motive pressures.
   Good agreement is found across all 2D and 3D models at on-design
   conditions. However, prediction at off-design conditions is only
   acceptable with 3D models, making 3D simulations mandatory to correctly
   predict the critical pressure and achieve reasonable results at
   off-design conditions. This may partly depend on the specific geometry
   under consideration, which in the present study has a rectangular cross
   section with low aspect ratio. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect has been studied in the Ni-based
   superalloy IN100 which is currently used as a disk material in jet
   engines. A series of tensile tests was carried out at 588 K, 755 K, and
   922 K (315 degrees C, 482 degrees C, and 649 degrees C) at plastic
   strain rates ranging from a low of 6.21 x 10(-6) s(-1) to a high of 4.92
   x 10(-2) s(-1). The activation energy was determined using the slope of
   a line on a strain rate/temperature graph which divided the area of the
   graph into two regions: (1) ``PLC behavior observed,'' and (2) ``No PLC
   behavior observed.'' A new statistical approach was developed to
   objectively differentiate between a true PLC effect and experimental
   uncertainty (i.e., ``noise''). The value of the activation energy was
   found to be 1.14 eV/atom, which strongly suggests that the rate
   controlling process was bulk diffusion of C in the lattice. A
   qualitative model, based on the Orowan equation and slip band
   dislocation mechanics, was proposed, which unifies the seemingly
   disparate ideas of the process being controlled by a single
   atom/dislocation interaction while at the same time exhibiting
   significant strains during PLC load drops. (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Abstract = {{The rapid development of portable and wearable electronic devices has

   nanogenerator (TENG) and a micro-supercapacitor (MSC) array into a
   single device. The SCMPU can be charged directly by ambient mechanical
   motion. We demonstrate the ability of the SCMPU to continuously power
   light-emitting diodes and a commercial hygrothermograph. This
   investigation may promote the development of sustainable self-powered
   systems and provide a promising new research application for

Abstract = {{A two-step solar thermochemical cycle based on Co3O4/CoO redox reactions
   integrated into an Air Brayton cycle is considered for thermochemical
   heat storage. The two-step cycle encompasses (1) the thermolysis of
   Co3O4 to CoO and O-2 driven by concentrated solar irradiation and (2)
   the re-oxidation of CoO with O-2 to Co3O4, releasing heat and completing
   the cycle. The cycle steps can be decoupled, allowing for thermochemical
   heat storage and integration into an Air Brayton cycle for continuous
   electricity production. Kinetic analyses to identify the rate limiting
   mechanisms and determine kinetic parameters for both the thermolysis of
   Co3O4 and the re-oxidation of CoO with O-2 were performed using a
   combination of isothermal and non-isothermal thermogravimetry. The Co3O4
   thermolysis between 1113 and 1213 K followed an Avrami-Erofeyev
   nucleation model with an Avrami constant of 1.968 and apparent
   activation energy of 247.21 kJ mol(-1). The O-2 partial pressure
   dependence between 0\% and 20\% O-2-Ar was determined with a power rate
   law, resulting in a reaction order of 1.506. Ionic diffusion was the
   rate limiting step for CoO oxidation between 450 and 750 K with an
   apparent activation energy of 58.07 kJ mori and no evident dependence on
   O-2 concentration between 5\% and 100\% O-2-Ar. Solid characterization
   was performed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder
   diffraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   fluid: Reactor design and efficiency estimation}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{547-561}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new reactor concept for two-step partial redox cycles is presented and
   evaluated by transient simulation that considers heat and mass transfer
   along with reaction kinetics. The major difference between the reactor
   described herein and previous designs is that the conversion from solar
   to chemical energy is divided into two steps: sunlight-to-thermal energy
   conversion accomplished with a liquid metal based receiver, and the
   thermal-to-chemical conversion accomplished with a separately optimized
   array of reaction chambers. To connect these two conversion steps,
   liquid metal is used as a high temperature heat transfer fluid that
   feeds the solar energy captured in the receiver to the reactor. The
   liquid metal also facilitates efficient heat recuperation (similar to
   80\%) between the reaction chambers. The overall thermal-to-chemical
   efficiency from the thermal energy in the liquid metal to the chemical
   energy in the hydrogen fuel is estimated to be 19.8\% when ceria is
   employed as the reactive oxygen storage material. This estimated
   efficiency is an order of magnitude higher than previous designs and the
   reactor concept discussed herein identifies important insights that
   apply to solar fuel conversion in general. (C) 2015 Elsevier ltd. All

Title = {{F The impact of advance purchase deadlines on airline consumers' search

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Airlines frequently use advance purchase ticket deadlines to segment
   consumers. Few empirical studies have investigated how individuals
   respond to advance purchase deadlines and price uncertainties induced by
   these deadlines. We model the number of searches (and purchases) for
   specific search and departure dates using an instrumental variable
   approach that corrects for price endogeneity. Results show that search
   and purchase behaviors vary by search day of week, days from departure,
   lowest offered fares, variation in lowest offered fares across
   competitors, and market distance. After controlling for the presence of
   web bots, we find that the number of consumer searches increases just
   prior to an advance purchase deadline. This increase can be explained by
   consumers switching their desired departure dates by one or two days to
   avoid higher fares that occur immediately after an advance purchase
   deadline has passed. This reallocation of demand has significant
   practical implications for the airline industry because the majority of
   revenue management and scheduling decision support systems currently do
   not incorporate these behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A fully integrated power management ASIC for efficient inductive power
   transmission has been presented capable of automatic load transformation
   using a method, called Q-modulation. Q-modulation is an adaptive scheme
   that offers load matching against a wide range of loading (R-L) and
   coupling distance (d(23)) variations in inductive links to maintain high
   power transfer efficiency (PTE). It is suitable for inductive powering
   implantable microelectronic devices (IMDs), recharging mobile
   electronics, and electric vehicles. In Q-modulation, the zero-crossings
   of the induced current in the receiver (Rx) LC-tank are detected and a
   low-loss switch chops the Rx LC-tank for part of the power carrier cycle
   to form a high-Q LC-tank and store the maximum energy, which is then
   transferred to R-L by opening the switch. By adjusting the duty cycle
   (D), the loaded-Q of the Rx LC-tank can be dynamically modulated to
   compensate for variations in R-L. A Q-modulation power management (QMPM)
   prototype chip was fabricated in a 0.35 mu m standard CMOS process,
   occupying 4.8 mm(2). In a 1.45 W wireless power transfer setup, using a
   class-E power amplifier (PA) operating at 2 MHz, the QMPM successfully
   increased the inductive link PTE and the overall power efficiency by
   98.5\% and 120.7\% at d(23) = 8 cm, respectively, by compensating for
   150 Omega variation in R-L at D = 45\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of low-cost, conformal UHF antennas and
   RFID tags on two types of cork substrates: 1) natural cork and 2)
   agglomerate cork. Such RFID tags find an application in wine bottle and
   barrel identification, and in addition, they are suitable for numerous
   antenna-based sensing applications. This paper includes the
   high-frequency characterization of the selected cork substrates
   considering the anisotropic behavior of such materials. In addition, the
   variation of their permittivity values as a function of the humidity is
   also verified. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, three conformal RFID
   tags have been implemented on cork, and their performance has been
   evaluated using both a commercial Alien ALR8800 reader and an in-house
   measurement setup. The reading of all tags has been checked, and a
   satisfactory performance has been verified, with reading ranges spanning
   from 0.3 to 6 m. In addition, this paper discusses how inkjet printing
   can be applied to cork surfaces, and an RFID tag printed on cork is used
   as a humidity sensor. Its performance is tested under different humidity
   conditions, and a good range in excess of 3 m has been achieved, allied
   to a good sensitivity obtained with a shift of >5 dB in threshold power
   of the tag for different humid conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates energy-efficient device-to-device (D2D)
   communications in cellular networks. We aim to maximize the overall
   energy-efficiency (EE) of D2D users and regular cellular users (RCUs)
   while considering the circuit power consumption and the
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both types of users as well as
   power constraints. Three transmission modes, namely, dedicated mode,
   reusing mode, and cellular mode, are considered for D2D users to share
   spectrum with RCUs. Parametric Dinkelbach method and concave-convex
   procedure (CCCP) are adopted to transform the original optimization
   problems into more tractable forms through sequential convex
   approximations. Then, interior point method is exploited to obtain the
   optimal solution. Simulation results show that system EE can be improved
   significantly with the proposed mode switching algorithm compared with
   the single mode transmission. Besides, it is also shown that the reusing
   mode is more preferred in the EE based mode switching while it is the
   dedicated mode in the spectrum-efficiency (SE) based mode switching in
   most situations.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its excellent charge carrier mobility at the Dirac point,
   graphene possesses exceptional properties for high-performance devices.
   Of particular interest is the potential use of graphene nanoribbons or
   graphene nanomesh for field-effect transistors. Herein, highly aligned
   DNA nanowire arrays were crafted by flow-assisted self-assembly of a
   drop of DNA aqueous solution on a flat polymer substrate. Subsequently,
   they were exploited as ``ink{''} and transfer-printed on chemical vapor
   deposited (CVD)-grown graphene substrate. The oriented DNA nanowires
   served as the lithographic resist for selective removal of graphene,
   forming highly aligned graphene nanoribbons. Intriguingly, these
   graphene nanoribbons can be readily produced over a large area (i.e.,
   millimeter scale) with a high degree of feature-size controllability and
   a low level of defects, rendering the fabrication of flexible two
   terminal devices and field-effect transistors.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of light-element magnetism system is essential in
   fundamental and practical fields. Here, few-layer (similar to 3 nm)
   fluorinated hexagonal boron nitride (F-BN) nanocages with zigzag-edge
   triangular antidot defects were synthesized via a facile one-step
   solid-state reaction. They are free of metallic impurities confirmed by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and
   inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Ferromagnetism
   is obviously observed in the BN nanocages. Saturation magnetization
   values of them differed by less than 7\% between 5 and 300 K, indicating
   that the Curie temperature (Tc) was much higher than 300 K. By adjusting
   the concentration of triangular antidot defects and fluorine dopants,
   the ferromagnetic performance of BN nanocages could be effectively
   varied, indicating that the observed magnetism originates from
   triangular antidot defects and fluorination. The corresponding
   theoretical calculation shows that antidot defects and fluorine doping
   in BN lattice both favor spontaneous spin polarization and the formation
   of local magnetic moment, which should be responsible for long-range
   magnetic ordering in the sp material.}},

   nanoelectrospray liquid precursor injection to grow carbon and pure
   metal nanostructures via direct decomposition and electrochemical
   reduction of the relevant precursors, achieving growth rates 10(5) times
   greater than those observed in standard gas-phase FEBID. Initiating
   growth at the free surface of a liquid pool enables fabrication of
   complex 3D carbon nanostructures with strong adhesion to the substrate.
   Deposition of silver microstructures at similar growth rates is also
   demonstrated as a promising avenue for future development of the

   as explained, either. In addition, the half adder does not work as
   explained and a completely different Truth Table is obtained. The full
   adder is left to the reader as an exercise. Secondly, the previously
   published work, which is closely related to the work reported, was not

Abstract = {{We investigate the potential benefits of introducing meeting points in a
   ride-sharing system. With meeting points, riders can be picked up and
   dropped off either at their origin and destination or at a meeting point
   that is within a certain distance from their origin or destination. The
   increased flexibility results in additional feasible matches between
   drivers and riders, and allows a driver to be matched with multiple
   riders without increasing the number of stops the driver needs to make.
   We design and implement an algorithm that optimally matches drivers and
   riders in large-scale ride-sharing systems with meeting points. We
   perform an extensive simulation study to assess the benefits of meeting
   points. The results demonstrate that meeting points can significantly
   increase the number of matched participants as well as the system-wide
   driving distance savings in a ride-sharing system. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Regional climate impact of aerosols emitted by transportation modes and

Abstract = {{The transportation system is one of the main sectors with significant
   climate impact. In the U.S. it is the second main emitter of carbon
   dioxide. Its impact in terms of emission of carbon dioxide is well
   recognized. But a number of aerosol species have a non-negligible
   impact. The radiative forcing due to these species needs to be
   quantified. A radiative transfer code is used. Remote sensing data is
   retrieved to characterize different regions. The radiative forcing
   efficiency for black carbon are 396 200 W/m(2)/AOD for the ground mode
   and 531 +/- 190 W/m(2)/AOD for the air transportation, under clear sky
   conditions. The radiative forcing due to contrail is 0.14 +/- 0.06
   W/m(2) per percent coverage. Based on the forcing from the different
   species emitted by each mode of transportation, policies may be
   envisioned. These policies may affect demand and emissions of different
   modes of transportation. Demand and fleet models are used to quantify
   these interdependencies. Depending on the fuel price of each mode, mode
   shifts and overall demand reduction occur, and more fuel efficient
   vehicles are introduced in the fleet at a faster rate. With the
   introduction of more fuel efficient vehicles, the effect of fuel price
   on demand is attenuated. An increase in fuel price of 50 cents per
   gallon, scaled based on the radiative forcing of each mode, results in
   up to 5\% reduction in emissions and 6\% reduction in radiative forcing.
   With technologies, significant reduction in climate impact may be
   achieved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The intent of this research is to generate a set of non-dominated
   finite-memory policies from which one of two agents (the leader) can
   select a most preferred policy to control a dynamic system that is also
   affected by the control decisions of the other agent (the follower). The
   problem is described by an infinite horizon total discounted reward,
   partially observed Markov game (POMG). For each candidate finite-memory
   leader policy, we assume the follower, fully aware of the leader policy,
   determines a (perfect memory) policy that optimizes the follower's
   (scalar) criterion. The leader-follower assumption allows the POMG to be
   transformed into a specially structured, partially observed Markov
   decision process that we use to determine the follower's best response
   policy for a given leader policy. We then approximate the follower's
   policy by a finite-memory policy. Each agent's policy assumes that the
   agent knows its current and recent state values, its recent actions, and
   the current and recent possibly inaccurate observations of the other
   agent's state. For each leader/follower policy pair, we determine the
   values of the leader's criteria. We use a multi-objective genetic
   algorithm to create the next generation of leader policies based on the
   values of the leader criteria for each leader/follower policy pair in
   the current generation. Based on this information for the final
   generation of policies, we determine the set of non-dominated leader
   policies. We present an example that illustrates how these results can
   be used to support a manager of a liquid egg production process (the
   leader) in selecting a sequence of actions to maximize expected process
   productivity while mitigating the risk due to an attacker (the follower)
   who seeks to contaminate the process with a chemical or biological
   toxin.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a leader-follower partially observed Markov game (POMG) and
   analyze how the value of the leader's criterion changes due to changes
   in the leader's quality of observation of the follower. We give
   conditions that insure improved observation quality will improve the
   leader's value function, assuming that changes in the observation
   quality do not cause the follower to change its policy. We show that
   discontinuities in the value of the leader's criterion, as a function of
   observation quality, can occur when the change of observation quality is
   significant enough for the follower to change its policy. We present
   conditions that determine when a discontinuity may occur and conditions
   that guarantee a discontinuity will not degrade the leader's
   performance. We show that when the leader and the follower are
   collaborative and the follower completely observes the leader's initial
   state, discontinuities in the leader's value function will not occur.
   However, examples show that improving observation quality does not
   necessarily improve the leader's criterion value, whether or not the
   POMG is a collaborative game.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the performance characteristics of Al0.05Ga0.95N UV avalanche
   photodiodes (APDs) grown on different substrates. UV-APDs grown on a
   free-standing GaN substrate show lower dark-current densities for all
   fabricated mesa sizes than similar UV-APDs grown on a GaN/sapphire
   template. In addition, a stable avalanche gain higher than 5 x 10(5) and
   a significant increase in the responsivity of UV-APDs grown on a
   freestanding GaN substrate are observed. We believe that the high
   crystalline quality of Al0.05Ga0.95N UV-APDs grown on a free-standing
   GaN substrate with low dislocation density is responsible for the
   observed low leakage currents, high performance characteirstics, and

Abstract = {{A novel design of gradient-porous heat sink (GPHS) was proposed and

   Both gradient pore-size (dp) in the flow direction and the direction
   normal to flow direction were studied. It was found that, compared with
   conventional HPHS, GPHS can effectively improve the hydraulic and
   thermal performances simultaneously. Both the friction factor and
   overall thermal resistance of heat sinks with GPM configurations are
   considerably lowered. The Nusselt numbers of GPHS with gradient in flow
   direction are larger than those of homogeneous porous material (HPM)
   configurations. GPHS is also featured with the capabilities of
   effectively suppressing the bottom wall temperature and enhancing the

Abstract = {{We first investigate the fundamental properties of the mechanical system
   related to the control design. Then, a new optimal robust control is
   proposed for mechanical systems with fuzzy uncertainty. Fuzzy set theory
   is used to describe the uncertainty in the mechanical system. The
   desirable system performance is deterministic (assuring the bottom line)
   as well as fuzzy (enhancing the cost consideration). The proposed
   control is deterministic and is not the usual IF-THEN rule based. The
   resulting controlled system is uniformly bounded and uniformly
   ultimately bounded proved via the Lyapunov minimax approach. A
   performance index (the combined cost, which includes average fuzzy
   system performance and control effort) is proposed based on the fuzzy
   information. The optimal design problem associated with the control can
   then be solved by minimizing the performance index. The resulting
   control design is systematic and is able to guarantee the deterministic
   performance, as well as minimizing the cost. In the end, a mechanical
   system is chosen for demonstration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a transformer-based poly-phase network to generate
   fully differential quadrature signals with low loss, compact area, and
   high-precision magnitude and phase balance over an ultra-wide bandwidth.
   A fully differential high-coupling 8-port folded transformer-based
   quadrature hybrid serves as the basic building block for the poly-phase
   unit stage to achieve significant size reduction and low loss. Multiple
   poly-phase unit stages can be cascaded to form the multistage poly-phase
   network to substantially extend the quadrature signal generation
   bandwidth. The designs of the high-coupling transformer-based quadrature
   hybrid, the poly-phase unit stage, and the multistage transformer-based
   poly-phase network are presented with the closed-form design equations
   in this paper. As a proof-of-concept design, a 3-stage transformer-based
   poly-phase network is implemented in a standard 65 nm bulk CMOS process
   with a core area of 772 mu m 925 mu m. Measurement results of this
   poly-phase network over 3 independent samples demonstrate that the
   output In-Phase and Quadrature (I/Q) magnitude mismatch is less than 1
   dB from 2.8 GHz to 21.8 GHz with a passive loss of 3.65 dB at 6.4 GHz.
   The measured output I/Q phase error is less than 10 degrees from 0.1 GHz
   to 24 GHz. The effective Image Rejection Ratio (IRR) based on the
   measured I/Q balancing is more than 30 dB from 3.7 GHz to 22.5 GHz. The
   3-stage transformer-based poly-phase network design achieves
   high-quality quadrature signal generation over a first-ever one-decade
   bandwidth together with low-loss and compact area.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the combination of additive manufacturing
   techniques for realizing complex 3D origami structures for high
   frequency applications. A 3D-printed compact package for enclosing radio
   frequency (RF) electronics is built, that features on-package antennas
   for RF signal reception (for harvesting or communication) at orthogonal
   orientations. Conventional 3D printing technologies often require
   significant amounts of time and supporting material to realize certain
   structures, such as hollow packages. In this work, instead of
   fabricating the package in its final 3D form, it is 3D-printed as a
   planar structure with ``smart{''} shape-memory hinges that allow origami
   folding to a 3D shape after heating. This significantly reduces
   fabrication time and effectively eliminates the need for supporting
   material, thus minimizing the overall manufacturing cost. Metallization
   on the package is performed by directly inkjet printing conductive inks
   on top of the 3D-printed surface with a modified inkjet-printed process
   without the need for surface treatment or processing. Inkjet-printed
   on-package conductive features are successfully fabricated, that are
   combined with RF energy harvesting electronics to showcase the
   proof-of-concept of utilizing origami techniques to build fully 3D RF
   systems. The methodologies presented in this paper will be enabling the
   manufacturing of numerous real-time shape-changing 3D complex structures
   for electromagnetic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization can be
   used to produce highly branched polymer approximating the structure of
   dendrimers, but with less regularity and much less synthetic complexity.
   This can be accomplished by using a RAFT agent with a polymerizable
   double bond. Thus, the stoichiometry is fixed, with one branch point
   (RAFT agent double bond) per chain. Since each of these branch points
   will also branch, a highly regular highly branched material is formed.
   If this RAFT chemistry is applied to the monomer N-isopropyl-acrylamide
   (NIPAAm), the resulting water-soluble polymer has unique applications in
   drug delivery, due to the hyper-branched nature of the polymer, and also
   to the lower critical solution temperature exhibited by poly(NIPAAm). In
   this paper, a previous mathematical model of the RAFT-pNIPAAm system is
   extended, and validated against experimental polymerization data.}},

Title = {{Effects of shear band propagation on early waves generated by initial
   breakoff of tsunamigenic landslides}},
Journal = {{MARINE GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{370}},
Pages = {{99-112}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The landslide mechanism based on the phenomenon of the dynamic shear
   band propagation suggests that landslide run-out begins with a non-zero
   initial velocity. The initial uplift of the passive failure block during
   the landslide breakoff is similar to the reverse-fault, and therefore
   can generate an early tsunami wave that will be one of the first waves
   to start propagating and could be potentially detected by the deep ocean
   warning systems. This paper attempts to quantify this phenomenon using
   the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) approach within ABAQUS and
   modeling both soil and water as Eulerian materials. This approach allows
   for capturing the entire process of failure initiation, propagation and
   breakoff, taking into account large landslide deformations, soil
   plasticity and interaction of the sliding layer with the seawater. The
   study shows that the highest breakoff velocities are achieved for the
   shortest lengths of the initial weak zones initiating the shear band
   propagation. It also shows that both interaction of the sliding layer
   with water and appearance of the large plastic/failure zones during the
   shear band propagation cause slower uplift velocities and accelerations.
   For the computed example of a typical mid-size landslide in normally
   consolidated clays, with the initial weak zone length of several hundred
   meters and the final landslide length of about 1 km, the breakoff
   velocities can reach up to 4 m/s within 15 s, leading to an early wave
   of 0.5-1.5 m height, caused purely by this breakoff. Such waves can be
   easily detected by existing Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of
   Tsunamis (DART) systems, potentially allowing for some early tsunami
   warning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1027+}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An optical rectenna-a device that directly converts free-propagating
   electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies to direct current-was first
   proposed over 40 years ago(1), yet this concept has not been
   demonstrated experimentally due to fabrication challenges at the
   nanoscale(2,3). Realizing an optical rectenna requires that an antenna
   be coupled to a diode that operates on the order of 1 PHz (switching
   speed on the order of 1 fs). Diodes operating at these frequencies are
   feasible if their capacitance is on the order of a few attofarads(3,4),
   but they remain extremely difficult to fabricate and to reliably couple
   to a nanoscale antenna(2). Here we demonstrate an optical rectenna by
   engineering metal-insulator-metal tunnel diodes, with a junction
   capacitance of similar to 2 aF, at the tip of vertically aligned
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (similar to 10 nm in diameter), which act
   as the antenna(5,6). Upon irradiation with visible and infrared light,
   we measure a d.c. open-circuit voltage and a short-circuit current that
   appear to be due to a rectification process (we account for a very small
   but quantifiable contribution from thermal effects). In contrast to
   recent reports of photodetection based on hot electron decay in a
   plasmonic nanoscale antenna(7,8), a coherent optical antenna field
   appears to be rectified directly in our devices, consistent with
   rectenna theory(4,9,10). Finally, power rectification is observed under
   simulated solar illumination, and there is no detectable change in diode
   performance after numerous current-voltage scans between 5 and 77
   degrees C, indicating a potential for robust operation.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical micromachining is a very flexible and widely exploited
   process, but its knowledge should still be improved since several
   incompletely explained phenomena affect the microscale chip removal.
   Several models have been developed to describe the machining process,
   but only some of them consider a rounded edge tool, which is a typical
   condition in micromachining. Among these models, the Waldorf's slip-line
   field model for the macroscale allows to separately evaluate shearing
   and ploughing force components in orthogonal cutting conditions;
   therefore, it is suitable to predict cutting forces when a large
   ploughing action occurs, as in micromachining. This study aims at
   demonstrating how this model is suitable also for micromachining
   conditions. To achieve this goal, a clear and repeatable procedure has
   been developed for objectively validating its force prediction
   performance at low uncut chip thickness (less than 50 m) and relatively
   higher cutting edge radius. The proposed procedure makes the model
   generally applicable after a suitable and non-extensive calibration
   campaign. This article shows how calibration experiments can be selected
   among the available cutting trial database based on the model force
   prediction capability. Final validation experiments have been used to
   show how the model is robust to a cutting speed variation even if the
   cutting speed is not among the model quantities. A suitable set-up,
   especially designed for microturning conditions, has been used to
   measure forces and chip thickness. Tests have been performed on 6082-T6
   Aluminum alloy with different cutting speeds and different ratios
   between uncut chip thickness and cutting edge radius.}},

Abstract = {{The motions of particles in a viscous fluid confined within a spherical
   cell have been simulated using Brownian and Stokesian dynamics
   simulations. High volume fractions mimicking the crowded interior of
   biological cells were used. Importantly, although confinement yields an
   overall slowdown in motion, the qualitative effects of motion in the
   interior of the cell can be effectively modeled as if the system were an
   infinite periodic system. However, we observe layering of particles at
   the cell wall due to steric interactions in the confined space. Motions
   of nearby particles are also strongly correlated at the cell wall, and
   these correlations increase when hydrodynamic interactions are modeled.
   Further, particles near the cell wall have a tendency to remain near the
   cell wall. A consequence of these effects is that the mean contact time
   between particles is longer at the cell wall than in the interior of the
   cell. These findings identify a specific way that confinement affects
   the interactions between particles and points to a previously
   unidentified mechanism that may play a role in signal transduction and
   other processes near the membrane of biological cells.}},

Abstract = {{The brain is organized into networks composed of spatially separated
   anatomical regions exhibiting coherent functional activity over time.
   Two of these networks (the default mode network, DMN, and the task
   positive network, TPN) have been implicated in the performance of a
   number of cognitive tasks. To directly examine the stable relationship
   between network connectivity and behavioral performance, high temporal
   resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were
   collected during the resting state, and behavioral data were collected
   from 15 subjects on different days, exploring verbal working memory,
   spatial working memory, and fluid intelligence. Sustained attention
   performance was also evaluated in a task interleaved between resting
   state scans. Functional connectivity within and between the DMN and TPN
   was related to performance on these tasks. Decreased TPN resting state
   connectivity was found to significantly correlate with fewer errors on
   an interrupter task presented during a spatial working memory paradigm
   and decreased DMN/TPN anti-correlation was significantly correlated with
   fewer errors on an interrupter task presented during a verbal working
   memory paradigm. A trend for increased DMN resting state connectivity to
   correlate to measures of fluid intelligence was also observed. These
   results provide additional evidence of the relationship between resting
   state networks and behavioral performance, and show that such results
   can be observed with high temporal resolution fMRI. Because cognitive
   scores and functional connectivity were collected on nonconsecutive
   days, these results highlight the stability of functional
   connectivity/cognitive performance coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Bioethanol production output has increased steadily over the last two
   decades and is now beginning to become competitive with traditional
   liquid transportation fuels due to advances in engineering, the
   identification of new production host organisms, and the development of
   novel biodesign strategies. A significant portion of these efforts has
   been dedicated to mitigating the toxicological challenges encountered
   across the bioethanol production process. From the release of
   potentially cytotoxic or inhibitory compounds from input feedstocks,
   through the metabolic co-synthesis of ethanol and potentially
   detrimental byproducts, and to the potential cytotoxicity of ethanol
   itself, each stage of bioethanol production requires the application of
   genetic or engineering controls that ensure the host organisms remain
   healthy and productive to meet the necessary economies required for
   large scale production. In addition, as production levels continue to
   increase, there is an escalating focus on the detoxification of the
   resulting waste streams to minimize their environmental impact. This
   review will present the major toxicological challenges encountered
   throughout each stage of the bioethanol production process and the
   commonly employed strategies for reducing or eliminating potential toxic
   effects.}},

   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Progression}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motoneuron disease that
   is characterized by the degradation of neurons throughout the central
   nervous system. Inflammation have been cited a key contributor to ALS
   neurodegeneration, but the timeline of cytokine upregulation remains
   unresolved. The goal of this study was to temporally examine the
   correlation between the varying levels of pro-inflammatory type I
   cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and GFAP) and
   anti-inflammatory type II cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) throughout the
   progression of ALS in the SOD1 G93A mouse model. Cytokine level data
   from high copy SOD1 G93A transgenic mice was collected from 66
   peer-reviewed studies. For each corresponding experimental time point,
   the ratio of transgenic to wild type (TG/WT) cytokine was calculated.
   One-way ANOVA and t-tests with Bonferonni correction were used to
   analyze the data. Meta-analysis was performed for four discrete stages:
   early, pre-onset, post-onset, and end stage. A significant increase in
   TG cytokine levels was found when compared to WT cytokine levels across
   the entire SOD1 G93A lifespan for majority of the cytokines. The rates
   of change of the individual cytokines, and type I and type II were not
   significantly different; however, the mean fold change of type I was
   expressed at significantly higher levels than type II levels across all
   stages with the difference between the means becoming more pronounced at
   the end stage. An overexpression of cytokines occurred both before and
   after the onset of ALS symptoms. The trend between pro-inflammatory type
   I and type II cytokine mean levels indicate a progressive instability of
   the dynamic balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as
   anti-inflammatory cytokines fail to mediate the pronounced increase in
   pro inflammatory cytokines. Very early immunoregulatory treatment is
   necessary to successfully interrupt ALS-induced neuroinflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been hydrothermally prepared
   using polyethylene glycol as the carbon source. Herein, new MWCNTs
   composites with high adsorption capacity were prepared and applied as
   efficient adsorbents for adsorption of maxilon blue dye (GRL) from
   aqueous solution. The morphologies of the MWCNTs were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier
   transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The adsorption property of
   maxilon blue (GRL) from aqueous solution onto MWCNTs was studied as a
   function of mass dosage, pH of solution, initial dye concentration and
   temperature. The adsorption of GRL depends on the initial pH of the
   solution with maximum uptake occurring at about pH 10. The maximum
   adsorption capacity of prepared MWCNTs was 260.7mg/g. Langmuir,
   Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were applied to fit the experimental
   data. The Freundlich equilibrium isotherm fitted well the experimental
   data indicating the homogeneity of the adsorbent surface sites.
   Thermodynamics parameters were studied the changes in free energy (Delta
   G(0)), enthalpy (Delta H-0) and entropy (Delta S-0) during adsorption.
   It is noticeable that the adsorption of GRL dye onto MWCNTs was a
   spontaneous and endothermic process and indicates that the adsorption is
   favored at high temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete is the most used material on Earth except for water. Thus,
   there is much to be gained through improvements in the manufacturing of
   cement and the production of concrete to meet societal demand in a
   sustainable manner. This article reviews recent developments in three
   areas that have the potential to transform the ways in which
   infrastructure is specified, designed, and constructed: (1) expanding
   the use of supplementary cementitious materials and the identification
   of alternative supplementary cementitious materials, (2) growing the use
   of alternative cements and binder technologies, and (3) developing
   alternative reinforcement options. Strategies to facilitate the transfer
   of these emerging and next-generation materials and technologies from
   the research arena into real structures are also discussed.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A unified treatment of coupled optical and acoustic phonons in
   piezoelectric cubic materials is presented whereby the lattice
   displacement vector and the internal ionic displacement vector are found
   simultaneously. It is shown that phonon couplings exist in pairs only;
   either between the electric potential and the lattice displacement
   coordinate perpendicular to the phonon wave vector or between the two
   other lattice displacement components. The former leads to coupled
   acousto-optical phonons by virtue of the piezoelectric effect. We then
   establish three new conjectures that entirely stem from piezoelectricity
   in a cubic structured material slab. First, it is shown that isolated
   optical phonon modes generally cannot exist in piezoelectric cubic
   slabs. Second, we prove that confined acousto-optical phonon modes only
   exist for a discrete set of in-plane wave numbers in piezoelectric cubic
   slabs. Third, it is shown that coupled acousto-optical phonons do not
   exist at the longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon frequency where the
   dielectric constant vanishes.}},

Abstract = {{We report the result of a 2010 survey of the effects on the Iranian
   coastline of the tsunami which followed the earthquake of 27 November
   1945 (M (0) = 2.8 x 10(28) dyn cm; M (w) = 8.2), the only large event
   recorded along the Makran subduction zone since the onset of
   instrumental seismology. Based on the interview of elderly survivors of
   the event, we obtained a database of nine values of run-up or splash
   amplitudes on a segment of shore extending 280 km from Souraf in the
   West to Pasabandar near the Pakistani border, and ranging in vertical
   amplitude from 2.3 to 13.7 m. Witness reports are consistent with a
   significant delay (estimated at similar to 2.5 h) of the tsunami waves,
   suggesting that they were generated by an ancillary phenomenon, such as
   a landslide triggered by the earthquake. None of our witnesses bore
   ancestral memory of comparable events in the past, suggesting that
   reported predecessors to the 1945 earthquake may have been smaller in
   size. The survey also allowed the compilation of previously unreported
   data concerning the effects of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman tsunami.}},

Abstract = {{Islet transplant is a curative treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes.
   However, challenges, including poor tissue survival and a lack of
   efficient engraftment, must be overcome. An encapsulating or scaffolding
   material can act as a vehicle for agents carefully chosen for the islet
   transplant application. From open porous scaffolds to spherical capsules
   and conformal coatings, greater immune protection is often accompanied
   by greater distances to microvasculature. Generating a local oxygen
   supply from the implant material or encouraging vessel growth through
   the release of local factors can create an oxygenated engraftment site.
   Intricately related to the vascularization response, inflammatory
   interaction with the cell supporting implant is a long-standing hurdle
   to material-based islet transplant. Modulation of the immune responses
   to the islets as well as the material itself must be considered. To
   match the post-transplant complexity, the release rate can be tuned to
   orchestrate temporal responses. Material degradation properties can be
   utilized in passive approaches or external stimuli and biological cues
   in active approaches. A combination of multiple carefully chosen factors
   delivered in an agent-specialized manner is considered by this review to
   improve the long-term function of islets transplanted in scaffolding and
   encapsulating materials.}},

   Michigan}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{226}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A coupling technique is developed to predict the behavior of a buoyant
   river plume in a lake. The model incorporates a 3D hydrodynamic model
   (POMGL) and a 3D particle tracking model (Partic3D) for the far-field
   transport computations. The source conditions for the particle tracking
   model are obtained from a near-field model derived from the
   characteristics of the plume analyzed from extensive field studies on
   the Grand River plume, Lake Michigan. The empirical near-field model was
   developed to predict the geometry of the plume, dilution, and centerline
   trajectory near the river mouth, and to provide the concentration and
   location of the particles to be released in the far field. The coupled
   empirical-numerical model shows improved predictions in the near field
   versus the single numerical model. The present results strongly advocate
   the use of model combinations in order to improve coastal diffusion and
   transport processes. The primary application of the technique is in
   recreational water early-warning and forecasting systems that will
   estimate the immediate and short-term risk of exceeding pathogen
   indicator concentration criteria in lakes and coastal areas.}},

Abstract = {{We use Hodge-type orthogonal decompositions for studying the
   compatibility equations of the displacement gradient and the linear
   strain with prescribed boundary displacements. We show that the
   displacement gradient is compatible if and only if for any equilibrated
   virtual first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor field, the virtual work done
   by the displacement gradient is equal to the virtual work done by the
   prescribed boundary displacements. This condition is very similar to the
   classical compatibility equations for the linear strain. Since these
   compatibility equations for linear and nonlinear strains involve
   infinite-dimensional spaces and consequently are not easy to use in
   practice, we derive alternative compatibility equations, which are
   written in terms of some finite-dimensional spaces and are more useful
   in practice. Using these new compatibility equations, we present some
   non-trivial examples that show that compatible strains may become
   incompatible in the presence of prescribed boundary displacements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate robust beamforming to improve the energy
   efficiency (EE) of wireless networks when only imperfect or partial
   channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter. Due to
   CSI quantization errors and/or limited feedback information, CSI
   imperfections can be well modeled by a bounded uncertainty region. We
   focus on the worst case robust beamforming strategy to optimize the EE
   of downlink transmission under the deterministic bounded channel model,
   which merely assumes a maximal channel error magnitude. We start with a
   single-user single-cell MIMO system and obtain a closed-form design for
   robust beamforming. For a multicell network, robust beamforming is in a
   nonconvex fractional form, and the solution cannot be directly extended
   from the single-cell scenario. To solve this problem efficiently, we
   resort to a lower bound, instead of the primal problem, and cast it as a
   semidefinite program (SDP). The robustness and efficiency of the
   proposed beamforming design are confirmed by computer simulation
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Today, one of the major challenges in full-vehicle model creation is to
   get domain models from different experts while detecting any potential
   inconsistency problem before the Integration, Verification, Validation,
   and Qualification phase. To overcome such challenges, the conceptual
   design phase has been adapted to the current model development process.
   For that, the system engineers start to define the most relevant system
   architecture by respecting quality and time constraints. Next, the
   simulation model architects design the delivered system architecture in
   a more formal way with a modeling and simulation point of view to
   support the integration of domain-level simulation models in a
   consistent fashion. Finally, the model architects negotiate with
   different simulation model providers with the aim of specifying
   vehicle-and domain-level simulation models and their interface
   connections. To improve knowledge sharing between the mentioned actors,
   we propose a model identity card (MIC) for classifying simulation model
   knowledge, including input/output parameters, method, and usage
   specifications. The fundamental concepts that form the basis of all
   simulation models are identified and typed for implementation into a
   computational environment. An industrial case study of the
   engine-after-treatment model is used to show how MICs and the integrated
   model design phase might be used in a given scenario. A validation
   protocol is conducted through a heuristic observation to estimate the
   rate of model rework and ambiguity reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The through-silicon-via (TSV) introduces new parasitic components into
   3-D ICs. This paper presents a novel method of extracting the parasitic
   capacitance between TSVs and their surrounding wires. For the first
   time, we examine electrical field (E-field) sharing effects from
   multiple TSVs and neighboring wires and their impact on timing, power,
   and noise with full-chip sign-off analyses. For fast and accurate
   full-chip extraction, we propose a pattern-matching algorithm that
   accounts for the physical dimensions of multiple TSVs and neighboring
   wires and captures all E-field interactions. Compared with the average
   error of a field solver, that of our extraction method, which requires
   only 2.4 s runtime and negligible memory for a full-chip 64-point fast
   Fourier transform (FFT64) design with 330 TSVs, is 0.063fF. Upon
   extraction of TSV-related parasitics, we observe that TSV-to-wire
   capacitance significantly increase average TSV net noise and the longest
   path delay. To reduce TSV-to-wire coupling, we implement two full-chip
   optimization methods and show that increasing the minimum distance
   between TSVs and neighboring wires reduces both coupling noise and the
   aggressor count. Thanks to E-field sharing from grounded wire guard
   rings, victim TSVs are more effectively shielded from aggressor noise. A
   full-chip analysis shows that these methods are highly effective in
   reducing noise with only slight impact on timing and area.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond the 22-nm technology node, interconnect parasitics are
   increasingly contributing to the degradation of circuit performance.
   Thus, the focus is on optimizing interconnect parasitics in order to
   achieve optimum performance. The increased total device capacitance and
   the reduced device resistance of multigate transistors amplify the
   importance of wire resistance in circuit delay. In this paper, the
   impact of interconnect resistance on the circuit performance is weighed
   against interconnect capacitance, and less aggressive wire width and
   thickness scaling are proposed. This analysis is carried out based on
   the results from fully timing-closed, GDSII-level layout of circuit
   blocks, for the 11-and 7-nm technology nodes. The sensitivity of circuit
   power dissipation and signal noise to interconnect dimensions is
   assessed in detail. This approach compromises wire capacitance and
   gradually renders it important in circuit delay. The circuit performance
   enhancement by airgap (AG) interconnect technology is studied with the
   traditional BEOL scaling versus the proposed wire sizing. It is found
   that using the latter wire sizing approach with air-gap interconnects is
   more beneficial to circuit performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel ten-phase faulttolerant permanent-magnet
   synchronous motor (FTPMSM) with two stators and two rotors on the same
   shaft. Furthermore, a concentrated, single-layer, and
   alternate-teeth-wound winding is adopted to enhance the fault isolation
   capacity of the motor. In addition, we propose a new approach to the
   speed control of the developed motor, which takes the electromagnetic
   torque ripple in the fault switch process into account. The control can
   guarantee the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of
   the system regardless of the load disturbance and the parameter
   variation, particularly for the fault switch process after a fault
   occurrence before the fault-tolerant control can take effect. Moreover,
   an optimal torque control is adopted to further improve the
   fault-tolerant performance, which enables a ripple-free torque operation
   under open-circuit and short-circuit fault conditions. Simulation and
   experimental results show that the FTPMSM system with the proposed
   control strategy has excellent fault-tolerant performance and good
   robustness. This paper provides an innovative approach by employing a
   robust control for a speed loop to guarantee the fault-tolerant
   performance of the proposed motor system under normal and fault
   conditions, even in the fault switch process.}},

Abstract = {{A high-speed electric multiple unit (HS-EMU) bearing test rig that
   simulates the working conditions of axle-box bearings is an important
   performance evaluation device. Because of heavy working loads at high
   speed, two problems have been commonly encountered in testing industrial
   HS-EMU axle-box bearings on a conventional test rig, which are highly
   unbalanced axial load on its support bearings and adverse clearance
   effects on test bearings. This paper presents a new HS-EMU bearing
   test-rig design with a relatively complete dynamic model for its
   analysis and a direct force control strategy to overcome these problems.
   In this strategy, a dual proportional-integral (PI) controller with a
   fuzzy logic selectable soft switch has been developed. The control
   strategy can be easily implemented on an industrial programmable logic
   controller as it relies only onmeasured force values and requires a
   small amount of calculation. The bearing test-rig controlled system has
   been experimentally evaluated against a conventional PI controller.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a reliable fault diagnosis methodology for various
   single and multiple combined defects of low-speed rolling element
   bearings. This method temporally partitions an acoustic emission (AE)
   signal and selects a portion of the signal, which contains intrinsic
   information about the bearing failures. This paper then performs
   frequency analysis for the selected time-domain AE signal by using
   multilevel finite-impulse response filter banks to obtain the most
   informative subband signals involving abnormal symptoms of the bearing
   defects. It does this by using a 2-D visualization tool that represents
   the percentage of the Gaussian-mixture-model-based residual
   component-to-defect component ratios via time-varying and
   multiresolution envelope analysis (TVMREA). Then, fault signatures in
   the time and frequency domains are extracted in the informative subband
   signals. Since all the extracted fault features may not be equally
   useful for diagnosis, the proposed genetic algorithm (GA)-based
   discriminative feature analysis (GADFA) selects the most discriminative
   subset of fault signatures. In experiments, single and multiple combined
   bearing defects under various conditions are used to validate the
   effectiveness of this fault diagnosis scheme using TVMREA and GADFA.
   Experimental results indicate that this reliable fault diagnosis
   methodology accurately identifies bearing failure type across a variety
   of conditions. In addition, GADFA outperforms other state-of-the-art
   feature analysis techniques, yielding 7.3\%-46.6\% performance
   improvements in average classification accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular network technologies have traditionally evolved to meet the
   ever-increasing need for capacity and coverage. Particularly, there has
   been a significant focus on exploiting the use of small cells and
   heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In the latter, the economic and
   environmental impact of the energy consumption is a key concern.
   Although much research has been done to address the energy consumption
   in HetNets, existing approaches have failed to capture the key factors
   affecting it. In this paper, the energy consumption in HetNets is
   analyzed with a focus on their multi-layer nature and the dependence of
   the energy consumption on the spatio-temporal traffic demands and the
   internal base station hardware components. The problem of minimizing the
   energy consumption is then studied and characterized in terms of a 0-1
   Knapsack-like problem. Due to the differences with the classical 0-1
   Knapsack problem, an efficient algorithm is introduced to minimize the
   energy consumption by adjusting the cell-association and the base
   stations on-off policies. Such algorithm is shown to be applicable to
   the two- and m-layer HetNet cases. Performance evaluation is provided to
   identify the achievable energy savings of our algorithm and its effect
   on the energy consumption, activity, and load across multiple layers.}},

Title = {{Role of Mitral Annulus Diastolic Geometry on Intraventricular Filling
   Dynamics}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{The mitral valve (MV) is a bileaflet valve positioned between the left
   atrium and ventricle of the heart. The annulus of the MV has been
   observed to undergo geometric changes during the cardiac cycle,
   transforming from a saddle D-shape during systole to a flat (and less
   eccentric) D-shape during diastole. Prosthetic MV devices, including
   heart valves and annuloplasty rings, are designed based on these two
   configurations, with the circular design of some prosthetic heart valves
   (PHVs) being an approximation of the less eccentric, flat D-shape.
   Characterizing the effects of these geometrical variations on the
   filling efficiency of the left ventricle (LV) is required to understand
   why the flat D-shaped annulus is observed in the native MV during
   diastole in addition to optimizing the design of prosthetic devices. We
   hypothesize that the D-shaped annulus reduces energy loss during
   ventricular filling. An experimental left heart simulator (LHS)
   consisting of a flexible-walled LV physical model was used to
   characterize the filling efficiency of the two mitral annular
   geometries. The strength of the dominant vortical structure formed and
   the energy dissipation rate (EDR) of the measured fields, during the
   diastolic period of the cardiac cycle, were used as metrics to quantify
   the filling efficiency. Our results indicated that the O-shaped annulus
   generates a stronger (25\% relative to the D-shaped annulus) vortical
   structure than that of the D-shaped annulus. It was also found that the
   O-shaped annulus resulted in higher EDR values throughout the diastolic
   period of the cardiac cycle. The results support the hypothesis that a
   D-shaped mitral annulus reduces dissipative energy losses in ventricular
   filling during diastole and in turn suggests that a symmetric stent
   design does not provide lower filling efficiency than an equivalent
   asymmetric design.}},

Abstract = {{The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to spatial
   concentration data, obtained using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), for
   the flow around a confined circular cylinder (R = 4; 900) and compared
   with their corresponding velocity and vorticity fields. The velocity,

   structures, i.e., shear layer rollup, instantaneous recirculation and
   von Karman vortex shedding. In the velocity and vorticity decomposition,
   instantaneous recirculation, and von Karman vortex shedding are
   represented in the highest energy modes. However, in the concentration
   decomposition, the most energetic modes represent the regions with
   strong concentration intermittency, i.e., where no dye is present,
   whereas the coherent structures, which are identified in the highest
   modes in the velocity and vorticity decomposition, are only found in the
   less energetic modes. The concentration-based decomposition identifies
   the shear layer around the cylinder, which is only partially captured by
   its vorticity-based counterpart. (c) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The at-rest lateral stress coefficient (K-0) is an important soil

   In this study, an innovative geophysics approach toward the evaluation
   of the in situ K-0 profile with depth is obtained by using small-strain
   stiffness anisotropy ratio (G(0,HH)/G(0,) (VH)) in soils. The newly
   proposed K-0 equation is derived from a database compiled from 12 test
   sites which have direct K-0 measurements, as procured from field tests,
   either self-boring pressuremeters (SBP) or total stress cells (TSC),
   and/or laboratory triaxial tests, instrumented consolidometers, and/or
   suction measurements. The data show a strong relationship between the
   overconsolidation difference (OCD = sigma(p)' -sigma(v0)') and stiffness
   anisotropy ratio, thus enabling a K-0 assessment in clays, silts, and

Abstract = {{Adaptation of existing infrastructure is a response to climate change
   that can ensure a viable, safe, and robust transportation network.
   However, deep uncertainties associated with climate change pose
   significant challenges to adaptation planning. Specifically, current
   transportation planning methods are ill-equipped to address deep
   uncertainties, as they rely on designing responses to a few predicted
   futures, none of which will occur exactly as envisioned. In this paper,
   we propose using dynamic adaptive planning (DAP), an emerging general
   strategic planning method, to account for deep uncertainties by building
   flexibility and learning mechanisms into plans that enable continuous
   adaptation throughout implementation. This paper first reviews
   uncertainty in general, introduces what is meant by deep uncertainty,
   and then introduces DAP. Then, DAP is applied to a case study of the
   Oakland approach to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which was
   initially assessed under the 2010-2011 FHWA Climate Change Vulnerability
   Assessment Pilot program, to illustrate how DAP could be applied as a
   response to climate change in the context of evolving transportation
   infrastructure adaptation planning practices in the United States. We
   conclude that DAP is well suited to account for the deep uncertainties
   of climate change in transportation and infrastructure planning, and
   provide suggestions for further research to better apply DAP in this
   field. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   permanent shape upon activation by an external stimulus. Most SMPs
   require programming at above their transition temperatures, normally
   well above the room temperature. In addition, most SMPs are programmed
   into shapes that are affine to the high temperature deformation.
   Recently, a cold-programmed anisotropic shape memory elastomeric
   composite was developed and showed interesting low temperature
   stretching induced shape memory behavior. There, simple, uniaxial
   stretching at low temperature transformed the composites into curled
   temporary shapes upon unloading. The exact geometry of the curled state
   depended on the microstructure of the composite, and the curled shape
   showed no affinity to the deformed shape. Heating the sample recovered
   the sample back to its original shape. This new composite consisted of
   an elastomeric matrix reinforced by aligned amorphous polymer fibers. By
   utilizing the plastic-like behavior of the amorphous polymer phase at
   low temperatures, a temporary shape could be fixed upon unloading since
   the induced plastic-like strain resists the recovery of the elastomer
   matrix. After heating to a high temperature, the permanent shape was
   recovered when the amorphous polymer softened and the elastomer matrix
   contracted. To set a theoretical foundation for capturing the
   cold-programmed shape memory effects and the dramatic non-affine shape
   change of this composite, a 3D anisotropic thermoviscoelastic
   constitutive model is developed in this paper. In this model, the matrix
   is modeled as a hyperelastic solid, and the amorphous phase of the
   fibrous mat is considered as a nonlinear thermoviscoplastic solid, whose
   viscous flow resistance is sensitive to both temperature and stress. The
   plastic-deformation like behavior demonstrated in the fiber is treated
   as nonlinear viscoplasticity with extremely high viscosity or long
   relaxation time at zero-stress state at low temperature. The anisotropic
   viscoplastic property of the fibrous mat is captured by an isotropic
   fibrous network superimposed with an oriented fibrous network. The
   material parameters in the model are identified from the experiments on
   the fibrous mat and on the composites, respectively. The cold-programmed
   shape memory behaviors of the composite are predicted by simulations and
   compared with experiments without further adjusting the material
   parameters. Good agreement is observed, indicating the ability of the
   present model to capture the anisotropic viscoplastic and shape memory
   behaviors. By using the developed constitutive model, effects of loading
   rate and fiber volume fraction on cold programmed shape memory behavior
   are discussed. Furthermore, the constitutive relation is applied to a
   mechanical model to study the cold-programmed curling of the laminates.

Abstract = {{The emergence of adjoint design methods has been a breakthrough in the
   field of aerodynamic shape optimization. The strength of such methods
   lies in the fact that the adjoint formulation effectively removes the
   curse of dimensionality by drastically reducing the cost of computing
   the gradient. However, the curse of dimensionality is still very much
   alive when it comes to design space exploration, where gradient-free
   methods cannot be avoided. In attempt to solve this problem, this work
   presents a method called latent space gradient transformation, which
   facilitates gradient-free exploration for cases where function
   evaluations are expensive and dimensionality is high. The method builds
   upon previous work by applying principal component analysis to gradient
   information, something that had not been done before. This yields a
   low-rank transformation that maps a high-dimensional design space onto
   an equivalent, low-dimensional space in which gradient-free methods
   become more affordable. Concepts and limitations are discussed through
   analytical examples, and the method is tested on an overwing nacelle
   integration problem. Results showed that the method is cost-effective,
   requiring only 150 gradient samples to successfully reduce the problem
   from 145 design variables to less than 20, with an error of 10 drag
   counts on average and 25 drag counts at worst with 95\% confidence.}},

Pages = {{49-57}},

Abstract = {{Facility management has become increasingly challenging due to complex
   building systems that generate more diverse and complex maintenance
   issues. Facility managers and staff must deal with many daily
   maintenance requests despite various limitations, such as limited
   budgets and staff, which can cause delay in responding to some
   maintenance requests. A scheduling framework is proposed in this paper
   to assist in improving facility management. In practice, maintenance
   work is scheduled according to various priorities. For example, facility
   managers first consider the impact of each problem in terms of system
   failure and safety. In addition to those two factors, the framework
   proposed in this paper considers both energy efficiency and occupant
   satisfaction. It first quantified occupant satisfaction with data from
   current building maintenance work. An empirical study on occupant
   satisfaction was done based on classical disconfirmation theory and
   referenced post-occupancy evaluation (POE) research. A survey was
   designed to collect data to quantify occupant satisfaction. Based on the
   disconfirmation theory, an agent-based model was then developed to
   prioritize maintenance work to achieve maximum occupant satisfaction.
   Subsequently, a building energy model was simulated in EnergyPlus to
   quantify the impact of different aspects of a faulty HVAC system on
   energy consumption. Finally, the framework was tested through simulation
   and the results showed that occupant satisfaction level and building
   energy efficiency were improved by 30 and 97\%, respectively, when using
   the framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Safety as well as productivity performance in construction is often poor
   due to congested site conditions. We lack a formalized approach in
   effective activity-level construction planning to avoid workspace
   congestion. The purpose of this research is to investigate and prototype
   a new Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled approach for
   activity-level construction site planning that can pro-actively improve
   construction safety. The presented method establishes automated
   workspace visualization in BIM, using remote sensing and workspace
   modeling technologies as an integral part of construction safety
   planning. Global Positioning System (GPS) data loggers were attached to
   the hardhats of a work crew constructing cast-in-place concrete columns.
   Novel algorithms were developed for extracting activity-specific
   workspace parameters from the recorded workforce location tracking data.
   Workspaces were finally visualized on a BIM platform for detecting
   potential workspace conflicts among the other competing work crews or
   between material lifting equipment The developed method can support
   project stakeholders, such as engineers, planners, construction
   managers, foremen and site supervisors and workers with the
   identification and visualization of the required or potentially
   congested workspaces. Therefore, it improves the foundation on how
   decisions are made related to construction site safety as well as its
   potential impact on a productive and unobstructed work environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Current seismic design codes and damage estimation tools neglect the
   influence of successive events on structures. However, recent
   earthquakes have demonstrated that structures damaged during an initial
   event (mainshock) are more vulnerable to severe damage and collapse
   during a subsequent event (aftershock). This increased vulnerability to
   damage translates to increased likelihood of loss of use, property, and
   life. Thus, a reliable risk assessment tool is required that
   characterizes the risk of the undamaged structure subjected to an
   initial event and the risk of the damaged structure under subsequent
   events. In this paper, a framework for development of aftershock
   fragilities is presented; these aftershock fragilities define the
   likelihood that a building damaged during a mainshock will exhibit a
   given damage state following one or more aftershocks. Thus, the
   framework provides a method for characterizing the risk associated with
   damage accumulation in the structure. The framework includes the
   following: (i) creation of a numerical model of the structure; (ii)
   characterization of building damage states; (iii) generation of a suite
   of mainshock-aftershocks; (iv) mainshock-aftershock analyses; and (v)
   development of aftershock fragility curves using probabilistic
   aftershock demand models, defined as a linear regression of aftershock
   demand-intensity pairs in a logarithmic space, and damage-state
   prediction models. The framework is not limited to a specific structure
   type but requires numerical models defining structural response and
   linking structural response with damage. In the current study,
   non-ductile RC frames (low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise) are selected
   as case studies for the application of the framework. Copyright (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Rebound effect is defined as the lost part of ceteris paribus energy
   savings from improvements on energy efficiency. In this paper, we
   investigate economy-wide energy rebound effects by developing a
   computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Georgia, USA. The model
   adopts a highly disaggregated sector profile and highlights the
   substitution possibilities between different energy sources in the
   production structure. These two features allow us to better characterize
   the change in energy use in face of an efficiency shock, and to explore
   in detail how a sector-level shock propagates throughout the economic
   structure to generate aggregate impacts. We find that with economy-wide
   energy efficiency improvement on the production side, economy-wide
   rebound is moderate. Energy price levels fall very slightly, yet sectors
   respond to these changing prices quite differently in terms of local
   production and demand. Energy efficiency improvements in particular
   sectors (epicenters) induce quite different economy-wide impacts. In
   general, we expect large rebound if the epicenter sector is an energy
   production sector, a direct upstream/downstream sector of energy
   production sectors, a transportation sector or a sector with high
   production elasticity. Our analysis offers valuable insights for policy
   makers aiming to achieve energy conservation through increasing energy
   efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{MR imaging can noninvasively visualize tumor phenotype characteristics
   at the macroscopic level. Here, we investigated whether somatic
   mutations are associated with and can be predicted by MRI-derived tumor
   imaging features of glioblastoma (GBM).
   Seventy-six GBM patients were identified from The Cancer Imaging Archive
   for whom preoperative T1-contrast (T1C) and T2-FLAIR MR images were
   available. For each tumor, a set of volumetric imaging features and
   their ratios were measured, including necrosis, contrast enhancing, and
   edema volumes. Imaging genomics analysis assessed the association of
   these features with mutation status of nine genes frequently altered in
   adult GBM. Finally, area under the curve (AUC) analysis was conducted to
   evaluate the predictive performance of imaging features for mutational
   status.
   Our results demonstrate that MR imaging features are strongly associated
   with mutation status. For example, TP53-mutated tumors had significantly
   smaller contrast enhancing and necrosis volumes (p = 0.012 and 0.017,
   respectively) and RB1-mutated tumors had significantly smaller edema
   volumes (p = 0.015) compared to wild-type tumors. MRI volumetric
   features were also found to significantly predict mutational status. For
   example, AUC analysis results indicated that TP53, RB1, NF1, EGFR, and
   PDGFRA mutations could each be significantly predicted by at least one
   imaging feature.
   MRI-derived volumetric features are significantly associated with and
   predictive of several cancer-relevant, drug-targetable DNA mutations in
   glioblastoma. These results may shed insight into unique growth
   characteristics of individual tumors at the macroscopic level resulting
   from molecular events as well as increase the use of noninvasive imaging
   in personalized medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: To identify and reduce reasons for delays in
   procedure start times, particularly the first cases of the day, within
   the interventional radiology (IR) divisions of the Department of
   Radiology using principles of continuous quality improvement.
   Materials and Methods: An interdisciplinary team representative of the
   IR and preprocedure/postprocedure care area (PPCA) health care
   personnel, managers, and data analysts was formed. A standardized form
   was used to document both inpatient and outpatient progress through the
   PPCA and IR workflow in six rooms and to document reasons for delays.
   Data generated were used to identify key problems areas, implement
   improvement interventions, and monitor their effects. Project duration
   was 6 months.
   Results: The average number of on-time starts for the first case of the
   day increased from 23\% to 56\% (P value < .01). The average number of
   on-time, scheduled outpatients increased from 30\% to 45\% (P value <
   .01). Patient wait time to arrive at treatment room once they were ready
   for their procedure was reduced on average by 10 minutes (P value <
   .01). Patient care delay duration per 100 patients was reduced from 30.3
   to 21.6 hours (29\% reduction). Number of patient care delays per 100
   patients was reduced from 46.6 to 40.1 (17\% reduction). Top reasons for
   delay included waiting for consent (26\% of delays duration) and
   laboratory tests (12\%).
   Conclusions: Many complex factors contribute to procedure start time
   delays within an IR practice. A data-driven and patient-centered,
   interdisciplinary team approach was effective in reducing delays in IR.}},

Abstract = {{The biomechanical environment within the eye is of interest in both the
   regulation of intraocular pressure and the loss of retinal ganglion cell
   axons in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Unfortunately, this environment
   is complex and difficult to determine. Here we provide a brief
   introduction to basic concepts of mechanics (stress, strain,
   constitutive relationships) as applied to the eye, and then describe a
   variety of experimental and computational approaches used to study
   ocular biomechanics. These include finite element modeling, direct
   experimental measurements of tissue displacements using optical and
   other techniques, direct experimental measurement of tissue
   microstructure, and combinations thereof. Thanks to notable technical
   and conceptual advances in all of these areas, we are slowly gaining a
   better understanding of how tissue biomechanical properties in both the
   anterior and posterior segments may influence the development of, and
   risk for, glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although many challenging
   research questions remain unanswered, the potential of this body of work
   is exciting; projects underway include the coupling of clinical imaging
   with biomechanical modeling to create new diagnostic tools, development
   of IOP control strategies based on improved understanding the
   mechanobiology of the outflow tract, and attempts to develop novel
   biomechanically-based therapeutic strategies for preservation of vision

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine whether facial photographs
   obtained simultaneously with radiographs improve radiologists' detection
   rate of wrong-patient errors, when they are explicitly asked to include
   the photographs in their evaluation. Radiograph-photograph combinations
   were obtained from 28 patients at the time of portable chest radiography
   imaging. From these, pairs of radiographs were generated. Each unique
   pair consisted of one new and one old (comparison) radiograph. Twelve
   pairs of mismatched radiographs (i.e., pairs containing radiographs of
   different patients) were also generated. In phase 1 of the study, 5
   blinded radiologist observers were asked to interpret 20 pairs of
   radiographs without the photographs. In phase 2, each radiologist
   interpreted another 20 pairs of radiographs with the photographs.
   Radiologist observers were not instructed about the purpose of the
   photographs but were asked to include the photographs in their review.
   The detection rate of mismatched errors was recorded along with the
   interpretation time for each session for each observer. The two-tailed
   Fisher exact test was used to evaluate differences in mismatch detection
   rates between the two phases. A p value of < 0.05 was considered
   significant. The error detection rates without (0/20 = 0 \%) and with
   (17/18 = 94.4 \%) photographs were different (p = 0.0001). The average
   interpretation times for the set of 20 radiographs were 26.45 (SD 8.69)
   and 20.55 (SD 3.40) min, for phase 1 and phase 2, respectively
   (two-tailed Student t test, p = 0.1911). When radiologists include
   simultaneously obtained photographs in their review of portable chest
   radiographs, there is a significant improvement in the detection of
   labeling errors. No statistically significant difference in
   interpretation time was observed. This may lead to improved patient
   safety without affecting radiologists' throughput.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a framework for determining optimal
   respiratory airflow patterns for a multicompartment lung mechanics
   system with nonlinear resistance and compliance parameters. First, a
   nonlinear multicompartment lung mechanics model that accounts for
   nonlinearities in both the airway resistances and the lung compliances
   is developed. In particular, we assume that the resistive losses are
   characterized by a Rohrer-type model with resistive losses defined as
   the sum of linear and quadratic terms of the airflow. The proposed model
   is more realistic than those presented in the literature, since it takes
   into account the heterogeneity of lung anatomy and function as well as
   the nonlinearity of lung resistance and compliance parameters. This
   model can be used to provide a better understanding of pulmonary
   function as well as the process of mechanical ventilation. Next, using
   the proposed nonlinear multicompartment lung model, we develop a
   framework for determining optimal respiratory airflow patterns.
   Specifically, an optimization criterion that involves the minimization
   of the oxygen consumption of the lung muscles and lung volume
   acceleration for the inspiratory phase, and the minimization of the
   elastic potential energy and rapid airflow rate changes for the
   expiratory phase is formulated and solved. The solution to the
   formulated optimization problem is derived using classical calculus of
   variation techniques. Finally, several illustrative numerical examples
   are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed nonlinear
   multicompartment lung model and the corresponding optimal airflow
   patterns. Comparison with experimental data shows that our nonlinear
   resistance model predicts the airflow patterns more accurately than
   linear resistance models. Moreover, the optimization criterion used in
   this paper also provides a more accurate prediction of the optimal
   airflow patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Data centers are mission critical facilities that typically contain
   thousands of data processing equipment, such as servers, switches, and
   routers. In recent years, there has been a boom in data center usage,
   leading their energy consumption to grow by about 10\% a year
   continuously. The heat generated in these data centers must be removed
   so as to prevent high temperatures from degrading their reliability,
   which would cost additional energy. Therefore, precise and reliable
   thermal management of the data center environment is critical. This
   paper focuses on recent advancements in data center modeling and energy
   optimization. A number of currently available and developmental thermal
   management technology in data centers are broadly reviewed.
   Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for raised-floor data centers,
   experimental measurements, containment systems, economizer cooling,
   hybrid cooling, and device level cooling are all thoroughly reviewed.
   The paper concludes with a summary and presents areas of potential
   future research, which are based on the holistic integration of workload
   prediction and allocation, and thermal management using smart control
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Presently, air cooling is the most common method of thermal management
   in data centers. In a data center, multiple servers are housed in a
   rack, and the racks are arranged in rows to allow cold air entry from
   the front (cold aisle) and hot air exit from the back (hot aisle), in
   what is referred as hot-aisle-cold-aisle (HACA) arrangement. If the
   racks are kept in an open room space, the differential pressure between
   the front and back of the rack is zero. However, this may not be true
   for some scenarios, such as, in the case of cold aisle containment,
   where the cold aisle is physically separated from the hot data center
   room space to minimize cold and hot air mixing. For an under-provisioned
   case (total supplied tile air flow rate<total rack air flow rate) the
   pressure in the cold aisle (front of the rack) will be lower than the
   data center room space (back of the rack). For this case, the rack air
   flow rate will be lower than the case without the containment. In this
   paper, we will present a methodology to measure the rack air flow rate
   sensitivity to differential pressure across the rack. Here, we use
   perforated covers at the back of the racks, which results in higher back
   pressure (and lower rack air flow rate) and the corresponding
   sensitivity of rack air flow rate to the differential pressure is
   obtained. The influence of variation and nonuniformity in the server fan
   speed is investigated, and it is observed that with consideration of fan
   laws, one can obtain results for different average fan speeds with
   reasonable accuracy. The measured sensitivity can be used to determine
   the rack air flow rate with variation in the cold aisle pressure, which
   can then be used as a boundary condition in computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD)/rapid models for data center air flow modeling. The measured
   sensitivity can also be used to determine the change in rack air flow
   rate with the use of different types of front/back perforated doors at
   the rack. Here, the rack air flow rate is measured using an array of
   thermal anemometers, pressure is measured using a micromanometer, and
   the fan speed is measured using an optical tachometer.}},

Title = {{Impact Isolation Through the Use of Compliant Interconnects for
   Microelectronic Packages}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{First-level and second-level compliant interconnect structures are being
   pursued in universities and industries to accommodate the differential
   displacement induced by the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch
   between the die and the substrate or between the substrate and the
   board. The compliant interconnects mechanically decouple the die from
   the substrate or the substrate from the board, and thus reduce the
   thermally induced stresses in the assembly. This paper presents
   drop-test experimental and simulation data for scaled-up prototype of
   compliant interconnects. The simulations were based on Input-G method
   and performed using ANSYS (R) finite element software for varying drop
   heights. In parallel to the simulations, scaled-up compliant polymer
   interconnects sandwiched between a polymer die and a polymer substrate
   were fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing, and this
   fabrication provides a quick low-cost alternative to cleanroom
   fabrication. The prototype of the assembly was subjected to drop tests
   from varying drop heights. The response of the assembly during drop
   testing was captured using strain gauges and an accelerometer mounted on
   the prototype. The data from the experiments were compared with the
   predictions from the simulations. Based on such simulations, significant
   insight into the behavior of compliant interconnects under impact
   loading was obtained, which could be used for reliable design of
   compliant interconnect under impact loading. Both the experimental and
   simulation data reveal that the compliant interconnects are able to
   reduce the strains that transfer from substrate to die by one-order.}},

Title = {{A Review of Two-Phase Forced Cooling in Three-Dimensional Stacked
   Electronics: Technology Integration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) stacked electronics present significant
   advantages from an electrical design perspective, ranging from shorter
   interconnect lengths to enabling heterogeneous integration. However,
   multitier stacking exacerbates an already difficult thermal problem.
   Localized hotspots within individual tiers can provide an additional
   challenge when the high heat flux region is buried within the stack.
   Numerous investigations have been launched in the previous decade
   seeking to develop cooling solutions that can be integrated within the
   3D stack, allowing the cooling to scale with the number of tiers in the
   system. Two-phase cooling is of particular interest, because the
   associated reduced flow rates may allow reduction in pumping power, and
   the saturated temperature condition of the coolant may offer enhanced
   device temperature uniformity. This paper presents a review of the
   advances in two-phase forced cooling in the past decade, with a focus on
   the challenges of integrating the technology in high heat flux 3D
   systems. A holistic approach is applied, considering not only the
   thermal performance of standalone cooling strategies but also coolant
   selection, fluidic routing, packaging, and system reliability. Finally,
   a cohesive approach to thermal design of an evaporative cooling based
   heat sink developed by the authors is presented, taking into account all
   of the integration considerations discussed previously. The thermal
   design seeks to achieve the dissipation of very large (in excess of 500
   W/cm(2)) background heat fluxes over a large 1 cm(-1) cm chip area, as
   well as extreme (in excess of 2 kW/cm(2)) hotspot heat fluxes over small
   200 mu m x 200 mu m areas, employing a hybrid design strategy that
   combines a micropin-fin heat sink for background cooling as well as
   localized, ultrathin microgaps for hotspot cooling.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at investigating a polymer-based air-gap creation method
   for the packaging of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and
   exploring the chemical composition of the polymer residue on the final
   package. Polymer-based air-gap formation utilizes thermal decomposition
   of a sacrificial polymer, poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), encapsulated
   within an overcoat polymer. BCB (Cyclotene 4026-46) was used as the
   overcoat material because decomposition products of sacrificial polymer
   are able to permeate through it, leaving an embedded air-gap structure
   around the MEMS device. Size-compatibility and cleanliness of MEMS
   devices are important attributes of the polymer-based air-gap MEMS
   packaging approach. This study provides a framework for size-compatible
   and clean air-gap formation by selecting the type of PPC, optimizing
   thermal treatment steps, identifying air-gap formation options,
   assessing air-gap formation performance, and analyzing the chemical
   composition of the residue. The air-gap formation processes using
   photosensitive PPC films had at least twice the residue compared to
   processes using nonphotosensitive PPC films. The major contribution to
   the residue in photosensitive PPC films was from the photoacid generator
   (PAG), which was used to catalyze the thermal decomposition of the PPC.
   BCB is compatible with PPC, and provides mechanical stability during
   creation of the air-gaps. The polymer-based air-gaps provide a
   monolithic, low-cost, integrated circuit compatible MEMS packaging
   option.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study how well one can approximate arbitrary polytopes
   using sparse inequalities. Our motivation comes from the use of sparse
   cutting-planes in mixed-integer programing (MIP) solvers, since they
   help in solving the linear programs encountered during branch-\&-bound
   more efficiently. However, how well can we approximate the integer hull
   by just using sparse cutting-planes? In order to understand this
   question better, given a polyope (e.g. the integer hull of a MIP), let
   be its best approximation using cuts with at most k non-zero
   coefficients. We consider as a measure of the quality of sparse cuts.In
   our first result, we present general upper bounds on which depend on the
   number of vertices in the polytope. Our bounds imply that if has
   polynomially many vertices, using half sparsity already approximates it
   very well. Second, we present a lower bound on for random polytopes that
   show that the upper bounds are quite tight. Third, we show that for a
   class of hard packing IPs, sparse cutting-planes do not approximate the
   integer hull well, that is is large for such instances unless k is very
   close to n. Finally, we show that using sparse cutting-planes in
   extended formulations is at least as good as using them in the original
   polyhedron, and give an example where the former is actually much
   better.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of reconstructing signals from a subsampled
   convolution of their modulated versions and a known filter. The problem
   is studied as applies to a specific imaging architecture that relies on
   spatial phase modulation by randomly coded ``masks.{''} The diversity
   induced by the random masks is deemed to improve the conditioning of the
   deconvolution problem while maintaining sampling efficiency. We analyze
   a linear model of the imaging system, where the joint effect of the
   spatial modulation, blurring, and spatial subsampling is represented
   concisely by a measurement matrix. We provide a bound on the
   conditioning of thismeasurement matrix in terms of the number of masksK,
   the dimension (i.e., the pixel count) of the scene image L, and certain
   characteristics of the blurring kernel and subsampling operator. The
   derived bound shows that the stable deconvolution is possible with high
   probability even if the number of masks ( i.e., K) is as small as L log
   L N, meaning that the total number of (scalar) measurements is within a
   logarithmic factor of the image size. Furthermore, beyond a critical
   number of masks determined by the extent of blurring and subsampling,
   use of every additional mask improves the conditioning of the
   measurement matrix. We also consider a more interesting scenario where
   the target image is known to be sparse. We show that under mild
   conditions on the blurring kernel, with high probability the
   measurementmatrix is a restricted isometry when the number ofmasks is
   within a logarithmic factor of the sparsity of the scene image.
   Therefore, the scene image can be reconstructed using any of the
   well-known sparse recovery algorithms such as the basis pursuit. The
   bound on the required number of masks grows linearly in sparsity of the
   scene image but logarithmically in its ambient dimension. The bound
   provides a quantitative view of the effect of the blurring and
   subsampling on the required number of masks, which is critical for
   designing efficient imaging systems.}},

Title = {{Necitumumab in Metastatic Squamous Cell Lung Cancer Establishing a
   Value-Based Cost}},
Journal = {{JAMA ONCOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The SQUIRE trial demonstrated that adding necitumumab to
   chemotherapy for patients with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer
   (mSqCLC) increased median overall survival by 1.6 months (hazard ratio,
   0.84). However, the costs and value associated with this intervention
   remains unclear. Value-based pricing links the price of a drug to the
   benefit that it provides and is a novelmethod to establish prices for
   new treatments.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the range of drug costs for which adding
   necitumumab to chemotherapy could be considered cost-effective.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We developed a Markov model using data
   from multiple sources, including the SQUIRE trial, which compared
   standard chemotherapy with and without necitumumab as first-line
   treatment of mSqCLC, to evaluate the costs and patient life expectancies
   associated with each regimen. In the analysis, patients were modeled to
   receive gemcitabine and cisplatin for 6 cycles or gemcitabine,
   cisplatin, and necitumumab for 6 cycles followed by maintenance
   necitumumab. Our model's clinical inputs were the survival estimates and
   frequency of adverse events (AEs) described in the SQUIRE trial.
   Log-logistic models were fitted to the survival distributions in the
   SQUIRE trial. The cost inputs included drug costs, based on the Medicare
   average sale prices, and costs for drug administration and management of
   AEs, based on Medicare reimbursement rates (all in 2014 US dollars).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We evaluated incremental cost-effectiveness
   ratios (ICERs) for the use of necitumumab across a range of values for
   its cost. Model robustness was assessed by probabilistic sensitivity
   analyses, based on 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, sampling values from
   the distributions of all model parameters. RESULTS In the base case
   analysis, the addition of necitumumab to the treatment regimen produced
   an incremental survival benefit of 0.15 life-years and 0.11
   quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The probabilistic sensitivity
   analyses established that when necitumumab cost less than \$563 and less
   than \$1309 per cycle, there was 90\% confidence that the ICER for
   adding necitumumab would be less than \$100 000 per QALY and less than
   \$200 000 per QALY, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings provide a value-based range for

Abstract = {{With the rapid increase in volume of time series medical data available
   through wearable devices, there is a need to employ automated algorithms
   to label data. Examples of labels include interventions, changes in
   activity (e.g. sleep) and changes in physiology (e.g. arrhythmias).
   However, automated algorithms tend to be unreliable resulting in lower
   quality care. Expert annotations are scarce, expensive, and prone to
   significant inter- and intra-observer variance. To address these
   problems, a Bayesian Continuous-valued Label Aggregator (BCLA) is
   proposed to provide a reliable estimation of label aggregation while
   accurately infer the precision and bias of each algorithm. The BCLA was
   applied to QT interval (pro-arrhythmic indicator) estimation from the
   electrocardiogram using labels from the 2006 PhysioNet/Computing in
   Cardiology Challenge database. It was compared to the mean, median, and
   a previously proposed Expectation Maximization (EM) label aggregation
   approaches. While accurately predicting each labelling algorithm's bias
   and precision, the root-mean-square error of the BCLA was 11.78 +/- A
   0.63 ms, significantly outperforming the best Challenge entry (15.37 +/-
   A 2.13 ms) as well as the EM, mean, and median voting strategies (14.76
   +/- A 0.52, 17.61 +/- A 0.55, and 14.43 +/- A 0.57 ms respectively with
   p < 0.0001). The BCLA could therefore provide accurate estimation for
   medical continuous-valued label tasks in an unsupervised manner even
   when the ground truth is not available.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a layout optimization method for maximizing the
   torque-to-weight ratio of an electromagnetic actuator. Layout
   optimization, which focuses on finding practical designs to maximize
   output performance in a compact design, avoids nonlinearity and local
   convergence problems in the optimization of the electromagnetic system
   using two sequential steps; linear topology optimization and integer
   programming. Formulated in terms of decomposed volume and surface
   elements with equivalent current sources, the linear topology
   optimization optimizes the permanent magnet material distribution in the
   rotor. With the linearly optimized designs, integer programming
   determines the ``most preferred{''} design in the second step by
   evaluating performances over design complexity. As illustrations, the
   method is applied to maximize the torque performance of two different
   three-phase disk-shaped synchronous motors. The effects of two different
   current waveforms, sinusoidal and square wave, on the torque magnitude
   and ripple are considered in the optimization. The design method has
   been experimentally validated by comparing simulated results of the
   layout optimization with measured magnetic field and torque output. This
   component-wise method that maximizes the net force/torque averaged over
   various orientations represents an improvement over existing algorithms
   where topology optimization is conducted at a specific rotor orientation
   to reduce the computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial cargo delivery, also known as airdrop, systems are heavily
   affected by atmospheric wind conditions. Guided airdrop systems
   typically employ onboard wind velocity estimation methods to predict the
   wind in real time as the systems descend, but these methods provide no
   foresight of the winds near the ground. Unexpected ground winds can
   result in large errors in landing location, and they can even lead to
   damage or complete loss of the cargo if the system impacts the ground
   while traveling downwind. This paper reports on a ground-based
   mechatronic system consisting of a cup and vane anemometer coupled to a
   guided airdrop system through a wireless transceiver. The guidance logic
   running on the airdrop system's onboard autopilot is modified to
   integrate the anemometer measurements at ground level near the intended
   landing zone with onboard wind estimates to provide an improved,
   real-time estimate of the wind profile. The concept was first developed
   in the framework of a rigorous simulation model and then validated in
   the flight test. Both simulation and subsequent flight tests with the
   prototype system demonstrate reductions in the landing position error by
   more than 30\% as well as a complete elimination of potentially
   dangerous downwind landings.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) prepared with 6FDA-DAM polymer using
   ordered mesoporous silica MCM-41 spheres (MSSs), Grignard surface
   functionalized MSSs (Mg-MSSs) and hollow zeolite spheres are studied to

   near or above the so-called permeability-selectivity trade-off curve was
   achieved for the H-2/CH4, CO2/N-2, CO2/CH4, and O-2/N-2 systems. Two
   loadings (8 wt \% and 16 wt \%) of MSSs were tested using both constant
   volume and Wicke-Kallenbach sweep gas permeation systems. Besides single
   gas H-2, CO2, O-2, N-2, and CH4 tests, mixed gas (50/50 vol \%)
   selectivities were obtained for H-2/CH4, CO2/N-2, CO2/CH4, and O-2/N-2
   and found to show enhancements vs. single gases for CO2 including cases.
