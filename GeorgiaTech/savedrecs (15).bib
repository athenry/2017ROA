Abstract = {{A simple, sensitive, fast, and accurate isocratic high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection (205 nm) has been
   developed and validated for the quantification of latanoprost (in
   nanogram level) in pure and commercial dosage form. An Agilent Eclipse
   XDB-C-18 column (150 x 4.6 mm i.d., 3.5 mu m particle size) was used.
   Chromatography was performed with a mobile phase containing a mixture of
   acetonitrile and water (70: 30, v/v) containing 0.1\% v/v
   trifluoroacetic acid, adjusted at pH 3.0 at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1).
   Each analysis required 3.0 min including triamcinolone acetonide as an
   internal standard. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy,
   precision, specificity, system suitability, and robustness. The
   calibration curve was linear in the concentration range 0.0125-1 mu g
   mL(-1); the correlation coefficient was 0.999. The method proved to be
   accurate, precise, specific, rapid, and reproducible according to ICH
   standards. The method showed good recoveries (average 100.15 \%), and
   the relative standard deviations of intra-and inter-day were <2.0\%.
   This method is novel since there has been no report about analysis of
   latanoprost at ng mL(-1) levels using a simple HPLC method. Besides
   regular quality control assay of latanoprost in raw material and in
   commercial formulations, this method has key importance for scientists
   working on sustained drug delivery system of latanoprost in which
   quantification in nanogram levels is one of the most important
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to study the influence of the type and
   number of basic sites of activated carbon (AC) on the AC-enhanced
   ozonation of oxalate. A commercial activated carbon (AC) was thermally
   treated with N-2, H-2, and NH3 at different temperatures. The results of
   chemical and textural characterization of the original and modified ACs
   show that the specific surface area and number of basic sites generally
   increased with increasing treatment temperature, whereas the acidic
   oxygen-containing groups decreased. Nitrogen-containing groups formed
   after NH3 treatment. The oxalate removal rate increased in ozonation
   systems with modified ACs compared with that of systems with the
   original AC. Oxalate degradation increased when ACs with higher numbers
   of basic sites and larger specific surface areas were used, except for
   the AC treated under NH3 at 900 degrees C. Oxalate removal was
   attributed to surface oxidation and HO. oxidation in bulk solution. The
   former process was dominant in the ozonation system with 0.2 g/L AC at
   pH 7. The experimental results indicate pyrrole groups may enhance ozone
   decomposition to generate HO. in bulk solution, while pyridine groups
   possibly decreased the surface oxidation of oxalate. Other basic sites,
   such as basal planes and basic oxygen-containing groups, enhanced
   oxalate removal through surface oxidation, and indirectly weakened HO.

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to more fully understand the
   structure-property relationships in multiwalled carbon nanotube
   (MWNT)/high performance thermosetting polymer nanocomposites.
   Nanocomposites containing up to 7 wt.\% MWNTs and a polyimide matrix
   (PETI-330) were characterized after curing and these characterization
   results were compared against similar nanocomposites containing carbon
   nanofibers (CNFs). Glass transition temperature values and
   thermomechanical testing indicated that the physical properties of the
   MWNT nanocomposites followed different trends at MWNT loadings less than
   and greater than the percolation threshold. In contrast, the CNF
   nanocomposites roughly showed a single relationship between physical
   property changes and CNF loading at the loadings studied here, which
   were all less than the percolation threshold. Overall, these results
   highlight the challenges in improving the properties of high performance
   matrices and suggest that MWNT network formation reduces reinforcement
   efficacy and that MWNTs can interfere with free radical curing
   processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We compare and contrast the governing equations and numerical
   predictions of two higher-order theories of extended single crystal
   plasticity, specifically, Gurtin type and micropolar models. The models
   are presented within a continuum thermodynamic setting, which
   facilitates identification of equivalent terms and the roles they play
   in the respective models. Finite element simulations of constrained thin
   films are used to elucidate the various scale-dependent strengthening
   mechanisms and their effect of material response. Our analysis shows
   that the two theories contain many analogous features and qualitatively
   predict the same trends in mechanical behavior, although they have
   substantially different points of departure. This is significant since
   the micropolar theory affords a simpler numerical implementation that is
   less computationally expensive and potentially more stable. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Spinel NiFe2O4 thin films are derived via chemical solution deposition
   on silicon substrates. The films show a granular microstructure with

   the formation of randomly oriented, phase pure spinel nickel ferrite for
   pyrolysis at 100 degrees C to 500 degrees C and crystallization at 650
   degrees C to 900 degrees C for 10 to 30 min. It is shown that the
   pyrolysis temperature does not affect the microstructure and the
   resulting magnetic properties, while increasing annealing temperature
   results in increased grain size and saturation magnetization.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an alternative method utilizing real-time
   measurements of existing rotor magnetic field in the feedback loop for
   multi degree-of-freedom (DOF) orientation control of a permanent-magnet
   spherical motor (PMSM) characterized with redundant inputs. As the
   direct field-feedback control (DFC) system requires only measured
   magnetic fields, it eliminates the need of an external orientation
   sensing system and its major components can operate independently and
   permit parallel processing. The DFC method greatly reduces accumulated
   errors and time delay due to serial computations commonly encountered in
   existing methods that rely on orientation-dependent models for feedback
   control of a multi-DOF PMSM. In this paper, the method for determining
   the bijective relationship between the rotor orientation and measured
   magnetic field is presented, which enables the replacement of the
   orientation error by the magnetic field error in the control law. Using
   analytical magnetic field and torque models, the DFC design method is
   illustrated with two examples: a one-DOF motion system and a three-DOF
   PMSM; the latter has been experimentally implemented, for which an
   embedded multisensor system with connected bijective domains is
   designed. Excellent trajectory control results were obtained validating
   the concept feasibility of the DFC method for the PMSM.}},

Abstract = {{Phenomenological modeling of anisotropic damage in rock raises many
   fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical issues. In this paper, the
   maximum likelihood method is used to analyze the performance of the
   Differential Stress Induced Damage (DSID) model recently formulated by
   Xu and Arson {[}1]. The stress/strain relationship is a nonlinear
   function of parameters including unknown constants (i.e., damage
   constitutive parameters) and known variables (e.g., elastic parameters
   and controlled stress state). Logarithmic transformation, normalization
   and forward deletion are employed, in order to find the optimum number
   of constitutive parameters, as a trade off between accuracy and
   simplicity. For Eastern France claystone subject to deviatoric stress
   loading (e g,, triaxial and proportional compression loading), it is
   found that (1) only one damage parameter (a(2)) is needed in the
   expression of the free energy to predict stress/strain curves; (2) a(2)
   controls the deviation of the current principal directions of stress to
   the principal directions of damage; (3) model parameters involved in the
   damage criterion can be related to a(2). As a result, a(2) is the only
   parameter needed to model differential-stress induced damage in Eastern
   France claystone. It is also shown that within the set of assumptions
   made in this study, the DSID model is not sensitive to the initial
   damage threshold C-0, except for C-0 > 10(6) Pa, a range of values in
   which only one constitutive parameter becomes insufficient to predict
   the stress/strain curves of damaged claystone. Coupling probabilistic
   calibration and optimization methods to numerical codes promises to
   allow adapting the complexity of anisotropic damage models to different
   rocks and stress paths. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new hybrid method for solving fine-group eigenvalue
   transport problems is developed. This method extends the subgroup
   decomposition method to efficiently couple a new coarse-group quasi
   transport theory with a set of fixed-source transport decomposition
   sweeps to obtain the fine-group transport solution. The advantages of
   the quasi transport theory are its high accuracy, straight-forward
   implementation and numerical stability. The hybrid method is analyzed
   for a 1D benchmark problem characteristic of boiling water reactors
   (BWR). It is shown that the method reproduces the fine-group transport
   solution with high accuracy while increasing the computational
   efficiency up to 12 times compared to direct fine-group transport
   calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alumina (Al2O3)/carbon nanotube (CNT) (99/1 by weight) composite was
   prepared by mixing CNT dispersion with AlCl3-based gel, followed by high
   temperature sintering at a temperature up to 1150 degrees C in argon.
   Composite alumina precursor showed phase transition order from amorphous
   to gamma-Al2O3 after sintered at 900 degrees C for 2 h, partially to
   theta-Al2O3 after sintered at 1000 degrees C for 2 h, and then partially
   to alpha-Al2O3 after sintered at 1150 degrees C for 2 h. By comparison,
   control alumina precursor directly transformed from amorphous to
   alpha-Al2O3 after sintered at a relatively low temperature of 600
   degrees C for 2 h. Composite alumina showed porous structure with pore
   diameter ranging from 100 nm to 2 mu m, whereas control alumina was
   relatively pore-free. The elevated alumina-crystal phase transition
   temperatures and the formation of porous structure were ascribed to the
   presence of CNTs in alumina precursor. The composite alumina sintered at
   900 degrees C for 2 h containing only gamma-Al2O3 had a BET surface area
   of 138 m(2)/g, which was significantly higher than that of control
   alumina sintered at 1150 degrees C for 2 h containing only alpha-Al2O3,
   15 m(2)/g. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Title = {{Formation of defect-free 6FDA-DAM asymmetric hollow fiber membranes for
   gas separations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{459}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the formation of defect-free 6FDA-DAM asymmetric
   hollow fiber membranes. 6FDA-polyimides are of great interest for
   advanced gas separation membranes, and 6FDA-DAM polyimide is a
   representative polymer in this family with attractive dense film
   properties for several potential applications. The work reported here
   for the 6FDA-DAM polyimide provides insight for the challenging
   fabrication of defect-free asymmetric hollow fiber membranes for this
   class of 6FDA-polyimides, which behave rather different from lower free
   volume polymers. Specifically, the 6FDA based materials show relatively
   slow phase separation rate in water quench baths, which presents a
   challenge for fiber spinning. For convenience, we refer to the behavior
   as more ``non-solvent resistant{''} in comparison to other lower free
   volume polymers, since the binodal phase boundary is displaced further
   from the conventional position near the pure polymer-solvent axis on a
   ternary phase diagram in conventional polymers like Matrimid (R) and
   Ultem (R). The addition of lithium nitrate to promote phase separation
   has a useful impact on 6FDA-DAM asymmetric hollow fiber formation.
   UT/A-DAM phase diagrams using ethanol and water as non-solvent are
   reported, and it was found that water is less desirable as a non-solvent
   dope additive for defect-free fiber spinning. Phase diagrams are also
   reported for 6FDA-DAM dope formulation with and without the addition of
   lithium nitrate, and defect-free asymmetric hollow fiber membranes are
   reported for both cases. The effect of polymer molecular weight on
   defect-free fiber spinning was also investigated. Gas transport
   properties and morphology of hollow fibers were characterized. With
   several thorough case studies, this work provides a systematic guideline
   for defect free fiber formation from 6FDA-polymers. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   using bibliometric techniques based on databases of the Science Citation
   Index and the Social Science Citation Index. journal articles were the

   records. The pace of publishing in this field increased exponentially
   over these two decades, with the US accounting for the highest h-index
   (87) and the most publications (1273), followed by China and India. The
   US also plays a central role in the collaboration network among the 20
   most productive countries, while China and India do not because of their
   more limited cross-national authorships. The Indian Institute of
   Technology was the organization with the most records (126), but it has
   few multinational co-authored articles. In contrast, the Paul Scherrer
   Institute in Switzerland is central to the collaboration network. The
   largest number of retrieved journal articles was in the area of energy
   applications (1059 articles) followed by light absorbing materials (983)
   and solar cells (420). Energy applications mainly address hydrogen,
   desalination, air conditioning, drying, heat pumps, biomass, and water
   splitting, while the light absorbing material mainly cover nano
   materials, TiO2, semiconductors, thin films, phase change material and

Title = {{MIRPLib - A library of maritime inventory routing problem instances:

Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed description of a particular class of
   deterministic single product Maritime Inventory Routing Problems
   (MIRPs), which we call deep-sea MIRPs with inventory tracking at every
   port. This class involves vessel travel times between ports that are
   significantly longer than the time spent in port and require inventory
   levels at all ports to be monitored throughout the planning horizon.
   After providing a comprehensive literature survey of this class, we
   introduce a core model for it cast as a mixed-integer linear program.
   This formulation is quite general and incorporates assumptions and
   families of constraints that are most prevalent in practice. We also
   discuss other modeling features commonly found in the literature and how
   they can be incorporated into the core model. We then offer a unified
   discussion of some of the most common advanced techniques used for
   improving the bounds of these problems. Finally, we present a library,
   called MIRPLib, of publicly available test problem instances for MIRPs
   with inventory tracking at every port. Despite a growing interest in
   combined routing and inventory management problems in a maritime
   setting, no data sets are publicly available, which represents a
   significant ``barrier to entry{''} for those interested in related
   research. Our main goal for MIRPLib is to help maritime inventory
   routing gain maturity as an important and interesting class of planning
   problems. As a means to this end, we (1) make available benchmark
   instances for this particular class of MIRPs; (2) provide the
   mixed-integer linear programming community with a set of optimization
   problem instances from the maritime transportation domain in LP and MPS
   format; and (3) provide a template for other researchers when specifying
   characteristics of MIRPs arising in other settings. Best known
   computational results are reported for each instance. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   decorating the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles

   charged polymer (Nafion), and cast into membranes under an applied

   indirectly confirmed by proton conductivity values. The strong
   electrostatic interaction between chitosan and Nafion prevented oxygen
   permeability and water evaporation at elevated temperatures through the
   proton conductive channels. The resultant proton exchange membranes
   showed lower conduction dependency to relative humidity, which is highly
   desirable for hydrogen fuel cells. The fuel cell performance tests were

Abstract = {{Gel spun polyacrylonitrile/carbon nanotube (PAN/CNT) composite fibers
   have been produced, and the stress-induced G' Raman band shifts in the
   CNTs have been monitored to observe stress transfer during fiber strain.
   Improvements in CNT quality. CNT dispersion, and post-processing fiber
   drawing are shown to increase the stress transfer from the matrix to the
   CNT. Radial breathing mode (RBM) intensity of specific CNT chiralities
   confirms CNT debundling during fiber processing. During PAN/CNT fiber
   straining, there reaches a plateau in the CNT G' downshift, signifying
   that the stress on the CNT is maintained despite continued straining of
   the PAN/CNT fiber. Correlating CN'T strain with CNT modulus and volume
   fraction allows for the interfacial shear strength (tau(i)) of the
   PAN-CNT interface to be determined. The as-spun and fully drawn
   PAN/CNT-A (99/1) nano composite fibers exhibit tau(i) of 13.1 and 30.9
   MPa, respectively, while an improved CNT dispersion (PAN/CNT-A
   (99.9/0.1)) results in tau(i) equal to 44.3 MPa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Helical structures, almost ubiquitous in biological systems, have
   inspired the design and manufacturing of helical devices with
   applications in nanoelecromechanical systems, morphing structures,
   optoelectronics, micro-robotics, and drug delivery devices. Meanwhile,
   multi-stable structures, represented by the Venus flytrap and slap
   bracelet, have attracted increasing attention due to their applications
   in making artificial muscles, bio-inspired robots, deployable aerospace
   components, and energy harvesting devices. Here we show that the
   mechanical anisotropy pertinent to helical deformation, together with
   geometric nonlinearity associated with multi-stability, can lead to a
   selection principle of the geometric shape and multi-stability in
   spontaneous helical ribbons. Simple table-top experiments were also
   performed to illustrate the working principle. Our work will promote
   understanding of spontaneous curling, twisting, wrinkling of thin
   objects, and their instabilities. The proposed theoretical framework can
   also serve as a tool for developing functional structures and devices
   featuring tunable, morphing geometries and smart actuation mechanisms

Title = {{System factors to explain H1N1 state vaccination rates for adults in US

Journal = {{VACCINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{3088-3093}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: During the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, vaccine in short
   supply was allocated to states pro rata by population, yet the
   vaccination rates of adults differed by state. States also differed in
   their campaign processes and decisions. Analyzing the campaign provides
   an opportunity to identify specific approaches that may result in higher
   vaccine uptake in a future event of this nature.
   Objective: To determine supply chain and system factors associated with
   higher state H1N1 vaccination coverage for adults in a system where
   vaccine was in short supply.
   Methods: Regression analysis of factors predicting state-specific H1N1
   vaccination coverage in adults. Independent variables included state
   campaign information, demographics, preventive or health-seeking
   behavior, preparedness funding, providers, state characteristics, and
   H1N1-specific state data.
   Results: The best model explained the variation in state-specific adult
   vaccination coverage with an adjusted R-squared of 0.76. We found that
   higher H1N1 coverage of adults is associated with program aspects
   including shorter lead-times (i.e., the number of days between when
   doses were allocated to a state and were shipped, including the time for
   states to order the doses) and less vaccine directed to specialist
   locations. Higher vaccination coverage is also positively associated
   with the maximum number of ship-to locations, past seasonal influenza
   vaccination coverage, the percentage of women with a Pap smear, the
   percentage of the population that is Hispanic, and negatively associated
   with a long duration of the epidemic peak.
   Conclusion: Long lead-times may be a function of system structure or of
   efficiency and may suggest monitoring or redesign of distribution
   processes. Sending vaccine to sites with broad access could be useful
   when covering a general population. Existing infrastructure may be
   reflected in the maximum number of ship-to locations, so strengthening
   routine influenza vaccination programs may help during emergency
   vaccinations also. Future research could continue to inform program
   decisions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Martensitic phase transformation in bulk Nickle-Titanium (NiTi)-the most
   widely used shape memory alloy-has been extensively studied in the past.
   However, the structures and properties of nanostructured NiTi remain
   poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to
   study structural transformations in NiTi nanowires. We find that the
   tendency to reduce the surface energy in NiTi nanowires can lead to a
   new phase transformation mechanism from the austenitic B2 to the
   martensitic B19 phase. We further show that the NiTi nanowires exhibit
   the pseudoelastic effects during thermo-mechanical cycling of loading
   and unloading via the B2 and B19 transformations. Our simulations also
   reveal the unique formation of compound twins, which are expected to
   dominate the patterning of the nanostructured NiTi alloys at high loads.
   This work provides the novel mechanistic insights into the martensitic
   phase transformations in nanostructured shape memory alloy systems. (C)

Title = {{Improving the sensitivity of sample clustering by leveraging gene
   co-expression networks in variable selection}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many variable selection techniques have been proposed for
   the clustering of gene expression data. While these methods tend to
   filter out irrelevant genes and identify informative genes that
   contribute to a clustering solution, they are based on criteria that do
   not consider the potential interactive influence among individual genes.
   Motivated by ensemble clustering, there is a strong interest in
   leveraging the structure of gene networks for gene selection, so that
   the relationship information between genes can be effectively utilized,
   while the selected genes are expected to preserve all the possible
   clustering structures in the data.
   Results: We present a new filter method that uses the gene connectivity
   in the gene co-expression network as the evaluation criteria for
   variable selection. The gene connectivity measures the importance of the
   genes in term of their expression similarity with others in the
   co-expression network. The hard threshold and soft threshold
   transformations are employed to construct the gene co-expression
   networks. Both simulation studies and real data analysis have shown that
   the network based on soft thresholding is more effective in selecting
   relevant variables and provides better clustering results compared to
   the hard thresholding transformation and two other canonical filter
   methods for variable selection. Furthermore, a new module analysis
   approach is proposed to reveal the higher order organization of the gene
   space, where the genes of a module share significant topological
   similarity and are associated with a consensus partition of the sample
   space. We demonstrate that the identified modules can lead to
   biologically meaningful sample partitions that might be missed by other
   methods.
   Conclusions: By leveraging the structure of gene co-expression network,
   first we propose a variable selection method that selects individual
   genes with top connectivity. Both simulation studies and real data
   application have demonstrated that our method has better performance in
   terms of the reliability of the selected genes and sample clustering
   results. In addition, we propose a module recovery method that can help
   discover novel sample partitions that might be hidden when performing
   clustering analyses using all available genes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a computer-based first-principles kinetic model is
   developed to predict the degradation mechanisms and fates of
   intermediates and byproducts produced during aqueous-phase advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs) for various organic compounds. The model
   contains a rule-based pathway generator to generate the reaction
   pathways, a reaction rate constant estimator to estimate the reaction
   rate constant for each reaction generated, a mechanistic reduction
   module to reduce the generated mechanisms, an ordinary differential
   equations generator and solver to solve the generated mechanisms and
   calculate the concentration profiles for all species, and a toxicity
   estimator to estimate the toxicity of major species and calculate
   time-dependent profiles of relative toxicity (i.e., concentration of
   species divided by toxicity value). We predict concentration profiles of
   acetone and trichloroethylene and their intermediates and byproducts in
   photolysis with hydrogen peroxide (i.e., UV/H2O2) and validate with
   experimental observations. The predicted concentration profiles for both
   parent compounds are consistent with experimental data. The calculated
   profiles of 96-h green algae chronic toxicity show that the overall
   toxicity decreases during the degradation process. These generated
   mechanisms also provide detailed and quantitative insights into the
   pathways for the formation and consumption of important intermediates
   and byproducts produced during AOPs. Our approach is sufficiently
   general to be applied to a wide range of contaminants.}},

Title = {{Enhanced Formaldehyde-Vapor Adsorption Capacity of Polymeric
   Amine-Incorporated Aminosilicas}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{6381-6390}},

Abstract = {{Airborne formaldehyde, which is a highly problematic volatile organic
   compound (VOC) pollutant, is adsorbed by polymeric amine-incorporated
   silicas (aminosilicas), and the factors that affect the adsorption
   performance are systematically investigated. Three different types of
   polymeric amines 1)poly(ethyleneimine) branched (PEIBR);
   2)poly(ethyleneimine) linear (PEILI); and 3)poly(allylamine) (PAA) are
   impregnated into two types of porous silicas {[}SBA-15 and mesocellular
   foam (MCF) silicas] with systematic changes of the amine loadings. The
   adsorption results demonstrate that the adsorption capacity increases
   along with the amine loading until the polymeric amines completely fill
   the silica pores. This results in the MCF silica, which has a larger
   pore volume and hence can accommodate more polymeric amine before
   completely filling the pore, giving materials that adsorb more
   formaldehyde, with the largest adsorption capacity, q, of up to
   5.7mmol(HCHO)g(-1) among the samples studied herein. Of the three
   different types of polymers, PAA, comprised of 100\% primary amines,
   showed the highest amine efficiency (mmol(HCHO)/mmol(N)) for capturing
   formaldehyde. The chemical structures of the adsorbed formaldehyde are
   analyzed by C-13 cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR,
   and it is demonstrated that the adsorbed formaldehyde is chemically
   attached to the aminosilica surface, forming hemiaminal and imine
   species. Because the chemical adsorption of formaldehyde forms covalent
   bonds, it is not desorbed from the aminosilicas below 130 degrees C
   based on temperature-programed-desorption (TPD) analysis. The high
   formaldehyde-adsorption capacity and stability of the trapped
   formaldehyde on the amine surface in this study reveal the potential
   utility of aminosilicas as formaldehyde abatement materials.}},

   crops and direct manipulation of biosynthesis pathways have produced
   lignin feedstocks with favorable properties for recovery and downstream
   conversion. Advances in analytical chemistry and computational modeling
   detail the structure of the modified lignin and direct bioengineering
   strategies for future targeted properties. Refinement of biomass
   pretreatment technologies has further facilitated lignin recovery, and
   this coupled with genetic engineering will enable new uses for this
   biopolymer, including low-cost carbon fibers, engineered plastics and
   thermoplastic elastomers, polymeric foams, fungible fuels, and commodity

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose and experimentally verify a low-latency
   digital signal processing (DSP)-free synchronous clock distribution and
   recovery scheme for high-speed dense wavelength division multiplexing
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access (DWDM-OFDMA)-based mobile
   backhaul (MBH) systems. The synchronous clock distribution is achieved
   jointly with high-speed OFDMA data signal transmission through a simple
   and low-cost intensity-modulation direct-detection (IMDD) optical
   backhaul architecture that also guarantees clock time and frequency
   stability. We experimentally verify aggregate 41.09-Gb/s (7 lambda x
   5.87 Gb/s/lambda) DWDM-OFDMA data rates with distribution and recovery
   of 50-MHz square wave and 4-GHz sinusoid clocks over 40 km standard
   single mode fiber (SSMF) with spectrally-efficient 25-GHz channel
   spacing and no remote optical amplification. To demonstrate the
   flexibility of the proposed system, aggregate 51.31-Gb/s (7 lambda x
   7.33 Gb/s/lambda) DWDM-OFDMA transmission with 50-MHz square wave and
   5-GHz sine wave clocks is also experimentally evaluated. Highly precise
   time and frequency accuracy is achieved, featuring an order of magnitude
   improvement with respect to LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) synchronization
   requirements. By supporting high bit rates, high spectral efficiency,
   and low-latency synchronization, the proposed approach is promising for
   future optical MBH.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate a concept of photonics-aided coordination for
   multi-cell downlink transmissions. The concept targets reliable
   high-throughput applications for future-proof millimeter-wave small
   cells based on radio-over-fiber fronthaul. Based on the physical
   properties of millimeter waves and the phase and magnitude relationship
   during optoelectrical conversion, a photonics-aided coordination module
   is proposed, which adjusts the overall channel matrix of optical
   wireless transmissions in order to achieve a distortion-free reception.
   Exploiting the multitude and density of remote access units, we
   specifically propose three methods of coordination, namely,
   photonics-aided amplification, synthesis, and interference cancellation,
   which directly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, increase the
   throughput, and mitigate the interference of cell-edge users,
   respectively. These methods are realized at the physical layer and can
   be transparent to data, which reduces the coordination overhead.
   Prototypes, involving end-to-end downlink transmissions, are
   established, which demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed methods for both scalar and vector signals.}},

Abstract = {{Data-dependent channel cross-modulation (XM) in multiband
   radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems have been investigated and illustrated
   for the first time. Nonlinear XM behaviors induced by a Mach-Zehnder
   modulator (MZM), including the intra-band XM between in-phase (I) and
   quadrature (Q) components of vector signals, as well as the inter-band
   XM between multiple bands of scalar/vector signals, have been studied by
   a closed-form theoretical analysis, and validated by experimental
   measurements. Consistent results have been obtained by both theoretical
   and experimental investigations. It was demonstrated that scalar signals
   only suffer from inter-band XM; whereas vector signals suffer from both
   intra-and inter-band XMs. Intra-band XM induces constellation
   compression distortion to vector signals, while inter-band XM induces
   eye-diagram degradation to scalar signals, and constellation scaling
   distortion to vector signals. To mitigate the signal distortions induced
   by data-dependent XM, arcsine pre-distortion technique was implemented
   to compensate the nonlinear response of MZM. Effective cancellations of
   both intra-and inter-band XM were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations have been used to study the
   adsorption of glycine, alanine, norvaline, valine, proline, cysteine,
   and serine on Pd(111). Most amino acids except cysteine adsorb onto the
   surface in a tridentate fashion through a nitrogen atom and both oxygen
   atoms. For cysteine, an additional bond is formed with the surface due
   to the strong affinity of the sulfur atom, resulting in a significantly
   larger adsorption energy. The adsorption patterns of amino acids we
   examined are supported by the shifts in vibrational frequencies
   associated with NHH and COO. The adsorption strength of amino acids
   depends on how much the molecules deform during the adsorption process.
   Understanding the adsorption of amino acids on Pd(111) provides
   fundamental information for future consideration of the interactions
   between their derivatives or more complicated biomolecules and metal
   surfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are regarded as ideal filler materials for
   polymeric fiber reinforcement due to their exceptional mechanical
   properties and ID cylindrical geometry (nanometer-size diameter and very
   high aspect ratio). The reported processing conditions and property
   improvements of CNT reinforced polymeric fiber are summarized in this
   review. Because of CNT polymer interaction, polymer chains in CNTs
   vicinity (interphase) have been observed to have more compact packing,
   higher orientation, and better mechanical properties than bulk polymer.
   Evidences of the existence of interphase polymers in composite fibers,
   characterizations of their structures, and fiber properties are
   summarized and discussed. Implications of interphase phenomena on a
   broader field of fiber and polymer processing to make much stronger
   materials are now in the early stages of exploration. Beside
   improvements in tensile properties, the presence of CNTs in polymeric
   fibers strongly affects other properties, such as thermal stability,
   thermal transition temperature, fiber thermal shrinkage, chemical
   resistance, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. This
   paper will be helpful to better understand the current status of
   polymer/CNT fibers, especially high-performance fibers, and to find the
   most suitable processing techniques and conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Although synthetic efforts have been fruitful in coarse color control,
   variations to an electrochromic polymer (ECP) backbone are less likely
   to allow for the fine control necessary to access the variations and
   shades of color needed in display applications. Through the use of thin
   films of cyan, magenta, and yellow ECPs, non-emissive subtractive color
   mixing allows the color of an electrochromic device (ECD) to be selected
   and tailored, increasing access to various subtle shades and allowing
   for a non-emissive display to exhibit a wide range of colors. Using a
   dual-active ECD, subtractive color mixing utilizing the cyan magenta
   yellow (CMY) primary system was examined. The bounds of the gamut, or
   the subset of accessible colors, using these three
   3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (PProDOT)-derived materials in combination
   with the recently recognized 3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole-based minimally
   color changing polymer (MCCP) were mapped, highlighting the benefit of
   applying subtractive color mixing toward the development of full-color
   non-emissive displays. Here, we demonstrate that ECPs are suitable for
   the generation of a wide gamut of colors through secondary mixing when
   layered as two distinct films, exhibiting both vibrantly colored and
   highly transmissive states.}},

Abstract = {{Strongly correlated phases exhibit collective carrier dynamics that if
   properly harnessed can enable novel functionalities and applications. In
   this article, we investigate the phenomenon of electrical oscillations
   in a prototypical MIT system, vanadium dioxide (VO2). We show that the
   key to such oscillatory behaviour is the ability to induce and stabilize
   a non-hysteretic and spontaneously reversible phase transition using a
   negative feedback mechanism. Further, we investigate the synchronization
   and coupling dynamics of such VO2 based relaxation oscillators and show,
   via experiment and simulation, that this coupled oscillator system
   exhibits rich non-linear dynamics including charge oscillations that are
   synchronized in both frequency and phase. Our approach of harnessing a
   non-hysteretic reversible phase transition region is applicable to other
   correlated systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions and can be a
   potential candidate for oscillator based non-Boolean computing.}},

Abstract = {{Microvascular disease leads to alterations of cerebral vasculature
   including the formation of microembolic (ME) strokes. Though ME are
   associated with changes in mood and the severity and progression of
   cognitive decline, the effect of ME strokes on cerebral microstructure
   and its relationship to behavioral endpoints is unknown. Here, we used
   adult and aged male rats to test the hypotheses that ME lesions result
   in subtle changes to white and gray matter integrity as detected by
   high-throughput diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and that these structural
   disruptions correspond to behavioral deficits. Two weeks post-surgery,
   aged animals showed depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose consumption
   test in the absence of altered cerebral diffusivity as assessed by
   ex-vivo DTI. Furthermore, DTI indices did not correlate with the degree
   of behavioral disruption in aged animals or in a subset of animals with
   observed tissue cavitation and subtle DTI alterations. Together, data
   suggest that behavioral deficits are not the result of damage to brain
   regions or white matter tracts, rather the activity of other systems may
   underlie functional disruption and recovery.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of Motor Adaptation in Reactive Balance Control}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Balance control must be rapidly modified to provide stability in the
   face of environmental challenges. Although changes in reactive balance
   over repeated perturbations have been observed previously, only
   anticipatory postural adjustments preceding voluntary movements have
   been studied in the framework of motor adaptation and learning theory.
   Here, we hypothesized that adaptation occurs in task-level balance
   control during responses to perturbations due to central changes in the
   control of both anticipatory and reactive components of balance. Our
   adaptation paradigm consisted of a Training set of forward
   support-surface perturbations, a Reversal set of novel countermanding
   perturbations that reversed direction, and a Washout set identical to
   the Training set. Adaptation was characterized by a change in a motor
   variable from the beginning to the end of each set, the presence of
   aftereffects at the beginning of the Washout set when the novel
   perturbations were removed, and a return of the variable at the end of
   the Washout to a level comparable to the end of the Training set.
   Task-level balance performance was characterized by peak center of mass
   (CoM) excursion and velocity, which showed adaptive changes with
   repetitive trials. Only small changes in anticipatory postural control,
   characterized by body lean and background muscle activity were observed.
   Adaptation was found in the evoked long-latency muscular response, and
   also in the sensorimotor transformation mediating that response.
   Finally, in each set, temporal patterns of muscle activity converged
   towards an optimum predicted by a trade-off between maximizing motor
   performance and minimizing muscle activity. Our results suggest that
   adaptation in balance, as well as other motor tasks, is mediated by
   altering central sensitivity to perturbations and may be driven by
   energetic considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Accounting for the combined effect of multiple sources of stochasticity
   in material attributes, we develop an approach that computationally
   predicts the probability of ignition of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs)
   under impact loading. The probabilistic nature of the specific ignition
   processes is assumed to arise from two sources of stochasticity. The
   first source involves random variations in material microstructural
   morphology; the second source involves random fluctuations in
   grain-binder interfacial bonding strength. The effect of the first
   source of stochasticity is analyzed with multiple sets of statistically
   similar microstructures and constant interfacial bonding strength.
   Subsequently, each of the microstructures in the multiple sets is
   assigned multiple instantiations of randomly varying grain-binder
   interfacial strengths to analyze the effect of the second source of
   stochasticity. Critical hotspot size-temperature states reaching the
   threshold for ignition are calculated through finite element simulations
   that explicitly account for microstructure and bulk and interfacial
   dissipation to quantify the time to criticality (t(c)) of individual
   samples, allowing the probability distribution of the time to
   criticality that results from each source of stochastic variation for a
   material to be analyzed. Two probability superposition models are
   considered to combine the effects of the multiple sources of
   stochasticity. The first is a parallel and series combination model, and
   the second is a nested probability function model. Results show that the
   nested Weibull distribution provides an accurate description of the
   combined ignition probability. The approach developed here represents a
   general framework for analyzing the stochasticity in the material
   behavior that arises out of multiple types of uncertainty associated
   with the structure, design, synthesis and processing of materials. (C)

Abstract = {{The impact of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) with carbon chain length
   C2 to C8 on the dissolution, aggregation, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   generation, and toxicity of citrate-coated AgNPs was investigated under
   UV irradiation. The presence of PFCAs decreased dissolution,
   aggregation, ROS generation, and toxicity of AgNPs because the
   negatively charged PFCAs sorbed on AgNP surface enhanced their
   stability. Both dissolution and aggregation rate of AgNPs decreased with
   chain length of PFCAs under UV irradiation, primarily because PFCAs with
   longer chain length sorbed on AgNP surface could form thicker coatings.
   The dissolution of AgNPs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the
   rate constant decreased from 0.58 h(-1) with C2 to 0.30 h(-1) with C8.
   The hydrodynamic diameters of AgNPs linearly increased under UV
   irradiation with aggregation rates ranged from 72.1 to 143.5 nm/h.
   O-2(center dot-) generation was observed in AgNP suspension with quantum
   yield of 0.12\%, but was completely suppressed by PFCAs because they
   inhibited the interaction between photoelectrons and O-2. A linear
   correlation was established between dissolved Ag+ and bacterial survival
   rates of AgNPs with and without PFCAs under UV irradiation. This study
   highlights the necessity of considering coexisting organic contaminants
   when investigating the environmental behaviors of AgNPs.}},

   lateral boundaries in quantifying the interface toe location and maximum
   pumping rate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{512}},

Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{The current study explores quantitatively the impact of lateral
   impermeable boundaries on groundwater pumping in head-controlled coastal
   systems, based on the potential theory and the image-well superposition
   method. We compare the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate
   among three scenarios that assume (SI) an infinite domain width and a
   finite domain length, (S2) a finite domain width and length, and (SS) an
   infinite domain width and length. Focusing exclusively on boundary
   effects, the upstream freshwater discharge is assumed the same for all
   scenarios, regardless of the variation in domain size. It is found that
   the impact from both inland and lateral boundaries could play a
   significant role on the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate
   (defined as the maximum allowable pumping rate that will not lead to
   pumping saltwater), depending on sizes of domain length and width. Since
   the impacts of inland fixed-head boundary and lateral impermeable
   boundaries are contrary on the maximum interface toe location (defined
   as the farthest inland point of the interface toe under pumping
   condition) and maximum pumping rate, they can be offset under certain
   critical conditions such that the results of the two quantitative
   indictors (i.e. the maximum interface toe location and maximum pumping
   rate) in S2 are close to those in SS. In particular, a linear equation
   is derived to reflect the relationship between the domain width and
   length under such critical conditions and expressed as L{*} = 0.87W({*})
   + 0.62 (W-{*} > I or L-{*} > 1.5), in which W-{*} and L-{*} are the
   domain width and length normalized by the distance between the coastline
   and pumping well. When I: > 0.87W({*}) + 0.62, the impact from lateral
   overcomes that from inland, producing a larger maximum interface toe
   location and a lower maximum pumping rate than those in SS. When L-{*} <
   0.87W({*}) + 0.62, by contrast, the impact from inland exceeds that from
   lateral and hence, resulting in a smaller maximum interface toe location
   and a higher maximum pumping rate. It is expected that the results
   developed in the current study could support the design of numerical
   models and 3D laboratory experiments as well as the assessment of domain
   size impact on pumping in head-controlled coastal groundwater systems.

Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: Rewarding stimuli in associative learning can transform the
   irregularly and infrequently generated motor patterns underlying
   motivated behaviors into output for accelerated and stereotyped
   repetitive action. This transition to compulsive behavioral expression
   is associated with modified synaptic and membrane properties of central
   neurons, but establishing the causal relationships between cellular
   plasticity and motor adaptation has remained a challenge.
   Results: We found previously that changes in the intrinsic excitability
   and electrical synapses of identified neurons in Aplysia's central
   pattern-generating network for feeding are correlated with a switch to
   compulsive-like motor output expression induced by in vivo operant
   conditioning. Here, we used specific computer-simulated ionic currents
   in vitro to selectively replicate or suppress the membrane and synaptic
   plasticity resulting from this learning. In naive in vitro preparations,
   such experimental manipulation of neuronal membrane properties alone
   increased the frequency but not the regularity of feeding motor output
   found in preparations from operantly trained animals. On the other hand,
   changes in synaptic strength alone switched the regularity but not the
   frequency of feeding output from naive to trained states. However,
   simultaneously imposed changes in both membrane and synaptic properties
   reproduced both major aspects of the motor plasticity. Conversely, in
   preparations from trained animals, experimental suppression of the
   membrane and synaptic plasticity abolished the increase in frequency and
   regularity of the learned motor output expression.
   Conclusions: These data establish direct causality for the contributions
   of distinct synaptic and nonsynaptic adaptive processes to complementary
   facets of a compulsive behavior resulting from operant reward learning.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new numerical model for the non-steady-state
   operation of the Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT) Cloud
   Condensation Nuclei (CCN) counter. The model simulates the Scanning Flow
   CCN Analysis (SFCA) instrument mode, where a wide supersaturation range
   is continuously scanned by cycling the flow rate over 20-120s. Model
   accuracy is verified using a broad set of data which include ammonium
   sulfate calibration data (under conditions of low CCN concentration) and
   airborne measurements where either the instrument pressure was not
   controlled or where exceptionally high CCN loadings were observed. It is
   shown here for the first time that small pressure and flow fluctuations
   can have a disproportionately large effect on the instrument
   supersaturation due to localized compressive/expansive heating and
   cooling. The model shows that, for fast scan times, these effects can
   explain the observed shape of the SFCA supersaturation-flow calibration
   curve and transients in the outlet droplet sizes. The extent of
   supersaturation depletion from the presence of CCN during SFCA operation
   is also examined; we found that depletion effects can be neglected below
   4000cm(-3) for CCN number.

   namely, the allocation of error between feasibility determination and
   selection of the best system, and the use of Common Random Numbers. We
   provide a recommended error allocation as a function of the number of
   constraints, supported by an experimental study and an approximate
   asymptotic analysis. The validity and efficiency of the new procedures
   with independent and CRN are demonstrated through both analytical and

Abstract = {{Biosensors exploiting communication within genetically engineered
   bacteria are becoming increasingly important for monitoring
   environmental changes. Currently, there are a variety of mathematical
   models for understanding and predicting how genetically engineered
   bacteria respond to molecular stimuli in these environments, but as
   sensors have miniaturized towards microfluidics and are subjected to
   complex time-varying inputs, the shortcomings of these models have
   become apparent. The effects of microfluidic environments such as low
   oxygen concentration, increased biofilm encapsulation, diffusion limited
   molecular distribution, and higher population densities strongly affect
   rate constants for gene expression not accounted for in previous models.
   We report a mathematical model that accurately predicts the biological
   response of the autoinducer N-acyl homoserine lactone-mediated green
   fluorescent protein expression in reporter bacteria in microfluidic
   environments by accommodating these rate constants. This generalized
   mass action model considers a chain of biomolecular events from input
   autoinducer chemical to fluorescent protein expression through a series
   of six chemical species. We have validated this model against
   experimental data from our own apparatus as well as prior published
   experimental results. Results indicate accurate prediction of dynamics
   (e. g., 14\% peak time error from a pulse input) and with reduced
   mean-squared error with pulse or step inputs for a range of
   concentrations (10 mu M-30 mu M). This model can help advance the design
   of genetically engineered bacteria sensors and molecular communication
   devices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The use of amniotic membrane (AM) to modulate wound healing and promote
   regeneration is increasing, but to date there has been no comprehensive
   study directly comparing the structural and biological properties of
   fresh and cryopreserved AM. Thus, in this study we compared fresh AM and
   fresh amniochorion to cryopreserved tissues. Histochemical staining
   confirmed that the cryopreservation process did not dramatically alter
   the tissue architecture nor collagen and glycosaminoglycan density.
   Biochemically, cryopreservation reduced total protein and human serum
   albumin contents, but retained high molecular weight hyaluronic acid
   species including the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid complex that is known
   to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring effects. Cryopreserved and
   fresh AM extracts similarly suppressed viability and proliferation of
   RAW264.7 macrophages, and inhibited the transforming growth factor beta
   1 promoter activity in corneal fibroblasts. These results collectively
   indicate that cryopreservation effectively preserves histological,
   biochemical, and functional properties of the AM tissue.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the derivation and verification of a sinusoidal
   steady-state equivalent-circuit model for microfabricated inductors
   developed for use in integrated power electronics. These inductors have
   a low profile, a toroidal air core, and a single-layer winding
   fabricated via high-aspect-ratio molding and electroplating. Such
   inductors inevitably have a significant gap between winding turns. This
   makes the equivalent resistance more difficult to model. The low profile
   increases the significance of the energy that is stored in the winding,
   which together with the winding gap makes the equivalent inductance more
   difficult to model. The models presented here account for these effects.
   Finally, the models are verified against results from 2-D and 3-D
   finite-element analysis (2-D FEA and 3-D FEA) direct measurement, and
   from in-circuit experimentation. In all cases, the equivalent-circuit
   model is observed to be accurate to within several percentage.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a cost-benefit framework for extending electricity access in
   currently un-electrified regions. We first show that distributed
   technologies may be the lowest-cost electrification option in areas
   where electricity consumption is low and grid connection costs are high.
   We also show that some centralized electrification programs provide
   services with subsidized rates far below cost recovery. An economic
   model is developed to compare three financial mechanisms that can be
   used to make capital intensive, distributed electrification technologies
   more accessible to rural populations; direct subsidies, rental programs
   and microloans. These contracts are compared on their ability to
   increase consumer utility for a given cost to the providing agency. We
   show that a direct technology subsidy is generally preferred when the
   desired subsidization is high and that, under certain parameter
   combinations, microloan and rental programs can improve energy access
   for the poor while also making a profit for the providing agency. (C)

Abstract = {{Nanonetworks consist of nano-sized communicating devices which are able
   to perform simple tasks at the nanoscale. Nanonetworks are the enabling
   technology of long-awaited applications such as advanced health
   monitoring systems or high-performance distributed nano-computing
   architectures. The peculiarities of novel plasmonic nano-transceivers
   and nano-antennas, which operate in the Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz),
   require the development of tailored communication schemes for
   nanonetworks. In this paper, a modulation and channel access scheme for
   nanonetworks in the Terahertz Band is developed. The proposed technique
   is based on the transmission of one-hundred-femtosecond-long pulses by
   following an asymmetric On-Off Keying modulation Spread in Time
   (TS-OOK). The performance of TS-OOK is evaluated in terms of the
   achievable information rate in the single-user and the multi-user cases.
   An accurate Terahertz Band channel model, validated by COMSOL
   simulation, is used, and novel stochastic models for the molecular
   absorption noise in the Terahertz Band and for the multi-user
   interference in TS-OOK are developed. The results show that the proposed
   modulation can support a very large number of nano-devices
   simultaneously transmitting at multiple Gigabits-per-second and up to
   Terabits-per-second, depending on the modulation parameters and the
   network conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Ontology reuse offers great benefits by measuring and comparing
   ontologies. However, the state of art approaches for measuring
   ontologies neglects the problems of both the polymorphism of ontology
   representation and the addition of implicit semantic knowledge. One way
   to tackle these problems is to devise a mechanism for ontology
   measurement that is stable, the basic criteria for automatic
   measurement. In this paper, we present a graph derivation representation
   based approach (GDR) for stable semantic measurement, which captures
   structural semantics of ontologies and addresses those problems that
   cause unstable measurement of ontologies. This paper makes three
   original contributions. First, we introduce and define the concept of
   semantic measurement and the concept of stable measurement. We present
   the GDR based approach, a three-phase process to transform an ontology
   to its GDR. Second, we formally analyze important properties of GDRs
   based on which stable semantic measurement and comparison can be
   achieved successfully. Third but not the least, we compare our GDR based
   approach with existing graph based methods using a dozen real world
   exemplar ontologies. Our experimental comparison is conducted based on
   nine ontology measurement entities and distance metric, which stably
   compares the similarity of two ontologies in terms of their GDRs.}},

Abstract = {{Selection of appropriate electron donors is important for charge
   transfer and photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) production from water. The
   influence of different inorganic electron donors (i.e., I-, S2-/SO32-,
   S2-, SO32-, Fe2+, and Ce3+) on H-2 production was investigated on the
   (CuAg)(0.15)In0.3Zn1.4S2 photocatalyst under visible light. The highest
   photocatalytic H-2 production rates were 1750, 1317, 820, 360, 260, 10
   mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with electron donors of 0.2M KI, 0.25M Na2S in
   combination with 0.35M Na2SO3, 0.25M Na2S, 0.35M Na2SO3, 0.2M FeCl2, and
   0.2M Ce-2(SO4)(3), respectively. I- was determined as the most effective
   electron donor for (CuAg)(0.15)In0.3Zn1.4S2 photocatalyst, probably
   because (1) the redox potential of I-3(-)/I- is relatively more suitable
   than those of other redox pairs for the charge transfer to valence band
   and (2) the positive surface charge of the (CuAg)(0.15)In0.3Zn1.4S2
   photocatalyst at the solution pH of 2 facilitates the absorption of I-
   and subsequent reaction with the valence band holes. The effect of the
   initial I- concentrations on the H-2 production and the potential
   reaction routes of I- on the photocatalyst were both analyzed to shed
   light on the reaction mechanisms. This study compared the efficacy of
   different inorganic electron donors in improving photocatalytic H-2
   production and provided fundamental insight into the search of
   appropriate electron donors and the efficient photocatalytic system
   design. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting from moving objects and machines in our daily life,
   such as automobile and train, is quite important for powering portable
   electronics, sensor systems and high fuel efficiency. Here, we present a
   disc-based design that simulates the braking system in an automobile for
   harvesting energy when the braking pads are both in contact and in
   non-contact modes. The mechanisms for the design are based on a
   conjunction use of triboelectrification and electrostatic-induction
   processes. The static non-mobile charges for driving the free electrons
   are created by triboelectrification when the two discs of opposite
   tribo-polarities are in direct contact during the braking action. The
   process for generating electricity in non-contact mode is due to the
   electrostatic induction of the existing tribo-charges on the insulating
   pad. Our approach demonstrates an effective means for harvesting energy
   from a rotating disc structure during both braking and non-braking
   processes, with potential application in motor cycles, automobiles, and
   even moving trains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New technologies that can scavenge ambient environmental energy have
   attracted increasing interest in the past decades. Recently,
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been demonstrated as a powerful
   approach for harvesting various forms of mechanical energies. In this
   work, a newly designed TENG is demonstrated by coaxially integrating
   multiple layers disk TENGs into a whole system, which transforms the
   fluid flow into rotation motion of multiple layers disks and generates a
   multiplied electrical output. To achieve the effective structural
   integration and output multiplication, a D-shape shaft is adopted to
   facilitate the synchronized relative rotation of all the
   segmentally-structured disk layers and light weight and low stiffness
   springs are employed to ensure the intimate contact of the
   tribo-surfaces. With the above design, the nanogenerator delivers an
   open-circuit voltage up to similar to 470 V and a short-circuit current
   density of 90.6 mA/m(2), corresponding to an instantaneous maximum power
   density of 42.6 W/m(2) (2.68 kW/m(3)) at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm.
   By combining the TENG with a water turbine, the device can be
   effectively driven by a water flow from a common household faucet. This
   technology represents an important advance of TENGs toward practical
   applications and shows great potential in hydroelectric power and wind
   power industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of a metal gate on high-kappa dielectric HfO2 is known to
   generate oxygen vacancy (OVs) defects. Positively charged OVs in the
   dielectric affect the gate electrostatics and modulate the effective
   gate workfunction (WF). Count and spatial allocation of OVs varies from
   device-to-device and induces significant local variability in WF and
   V-th. This paper presents the statistical models to simulate OV
   concentration and placement depending on the gate formation conditions.
   OV-induced variability is studied for SOI FinFET, and compared against
   the other sources of variability across the technologies. The
   implications of gate first and gate last processes to the OV

   high-electron mobility transistors shows that, for gate voltages
   corresponding to semi-ON bias conditions, the average electron energy

   at the edge of the gate. At this location, the carrier versus energy
   distribution has a large tail extending over 3 eV. When transferred to

   degradation. These results are consistent with the experimental data

Abstract = {{Many construction fatalities involving cranes and ground workers are
   caused by contact with objects and equipment, in particular being struck
   by crane loads and parts. One of the main risks in operating a tower
   crane is the limited visibility of the crane operator. An approach is
   presented that aims at increasing the situational awareness of a tower
   crane operator by aligning enhanced understanding of construction site
   layout with increased operator visibility of ground level operations.
   The developed method uses sensors to collect two data types, as follows:
   (1) a laser scanner measures the as-built conditions and geometry of a
   construction site, and (2) real-time location-tracking technology
   gathers the mostly dynamic location of workers on the ground. Several
   algorithms are presented to (1) identify blind spaces from the collected
   point cloud data that limit the visibility of a crane operator, (2)
   process real-time location-tracking data of workers on the ground, and
   (3) fuse the resulting data to create information that allows a
   quantitative assessment of the situational awareness of a tower crane
   operator. Results to a field trial are presented and show that a tower
   crane operator using the developed approach can increase understanding
   of where and when occluded spaces and ground-level operations occur. The
   developed methods for creating safety information from range point cloud
   and trajectory data is a promising approach in significantly improving
   the currently unsafe operation of tower cranes, one of the most utilized
   pieces of equipment in construction. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{System safety is of particular importance for many industries. Broadly
   speaking, it refers to the state or objective of striving to sustainably
   ensure accident prevention through actions on multiple safety levers
   (technical, organizational, and regulatory). While complementary to risk
   analysis, it is distinct in one important way: risk analysis is
   anticipatory rationality examining the possibility of adverse events (or
   accident scenarios), and the tools of risk analysis support and in some
   cases quantify various aspects of this analysis effort. The
   end-objective of risk analysis is to help identify and prioritize risks,
   inform risk management, and support risk communication. These tools
   however do not provide design or operational guidelines and principles
   for eliminating or mitigating risks. Such considerations fall within the
   purview of system safety.
   In this work, we propose a set of five safety principles, which are
   domain-independent, technologically agnostic, and broadly applicable
   across industries. While there is a proliferation of detailed safety
   measures (tactics) in specific areas and industries, a synthesis of
   high-level safety principles or strategies that are independent of any
   particular instantiation, and from which specific safety measures can be
   derived or related to, has pedagogical value and fulfills an important
   role in safety training and education. Such synthesis effort also
   supports creativity and technical ingenuity in the workforce for
   deriving specific safety measures, and for implementing these principles
   and handling specific local or new risks. Our set of safety principles
   includes: (1) the fail-safe principle; (2) the safety margins principle;
   (3) the un-graduated response principle (under which we subsume the
   traditional ``inherently safe design{''} principle); (4) the
   defense-in-depth principle; and (5) the observability-in-depth
   principle. We carefully examine each principle and provide examples that
   illustrate their use and implementation. We relate these principles to
   the notions of hazard level, accident sequence, and conditional
   probabilities of further hazard escalation or advancement of an accident
   sequence. These principles are a useful addition to the intellectual
   toolkit of engineers, decision-makers, and anyone interested in safety
   issues, and they provide helpful guidelines during system design and
   risk management efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of available propellant limits low-Earth orbit satellite
   lifetime due to the necessity of drag makeup. An electric propulsion
   device that uses in situ ions as propellants is considered as an
   alternative method for satellite drag makeup. This work presents a tool
   that consists of a one-dimensional thruster mathematical model
   integrated with the NASA International Reference Ionosphere to provide
   ion and neutral species densities for an electrostatic electric
   propulsion approach. This mathematical model predicts thrust, drag, and
   thruster power. The thrust-to-drag ratio and thruster power are averaged
   over the entire mission duration of one year and compared with various
   circular orbits and satellite configurations: 300-1000 km orbit
   altitude, 0-60 deg orbit inclination, low to high solar activity,
   0.1-5.0 m(2) satellite frontal area, 1-10 kV acceleration voltage, and
   1-10 m(2) total grid area. The Satellite Tool Kit provides orbit
   propagation. An average thrust-to-drag ratio greater than one is
   achievable for many thruster and orbit configurations considered in this
   analysis, at power levels less than 90 W. Most satellite missions at
   altitudes of less than 400 km may fall into the region in which the
   thrust-to-drag ratio is less than one. Thrust-to-drag ratio values of
   less than one will still benefit satellites by extending mission
   lifetimes for months or years with average power requirements less than
   100 W.}},

Abstract = {{Mars entry, descent, and landing trajectories are highly dependent on
   the vehicle's aerodynamics and the planet's atmospheric properties
   during the day of flight. A majority of previous Mars entry trajectory
   and atmosphere reconstruction analyses do not simultaneously estimate
   the flight trajectory and the uncertainties in the atmospheric and

   traditional trajectory estimation methods, can improve the knowledge of
   the aerodynamic coefficients and atmospheric properties, while also
   estimating the confidence interval for these parameters. Simulated data
   sets with known truth data are used in this study to show the
   improvement in state and uncertainty estimation by using adaptive
   filtering techniques. Such a methodology can then be implemented on
   existing and future Mars entry data sets to determine the aerodynamic

Abstract = {{Cartilage is a unique material in part because of it biphasic
   properties. The structure of cartilage is a porous matrix of collagen
   fibers, permeated with synovial fluid which creates a gliding and near
   frictionless motion in articulating joints. However, during in vitro
   testing or surgery, there exists potential for cartilage to dehydrate,
   or dry out. The effects of this drying can influence experimental
   results. It is likely that drying also changes joint performance in
   vivo. In in vitro testing of equine cartilage explants exposed to open
   air, the average roughness of cartilage changes from 1.85 +/- 0.78 to
   3.66 +/- 1.41 mu m SD in a 5-h period. Significant changes in roughness
   in individual samples are seen within 10 min of exposure to open air.
   However, the multi-scale nature of cartilage, characterized by the
   fractal dimension, does not significantly change during the same period.
   The current study attempts to quantify the magnitude of error that is
   introduced when cartilage is removed from its native environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Janus structures, named after the ancient two-faced Roman god Janus,
   comprise two hemistructures (e. g. hemispheres) with different
   compositions and functionalities. Much research has been carried out
   over the past few years on Janus structures because of the intriguing
   properties and promising potential applications of these unusually
   shaped materials. This Review discusses recent progress made in the
   synthesis, properties, and applications of strictly biphasic Janus
   structures possessing symmetrical structures but made of disparate
   materials. Depending on the chemical compositions, such biphasic
   structures can be categorized into soft, hard, and hybrid soft/hard
   Janus structures of different architectures, including spheres, rodlike,
   disclike, or any other shape. The main synthetic routes to soft, hard,
   and hybrid soft/hard Janus structures are summarized and their unique
   properties and applications are introduced. The perspectives for future
   research and development are also described.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Although eusociality evolved independently within several orders of
   insects, research into the molecular underpinnings of the transition
   towards social complexity has been confined primarily to Hymenoptera
   (for example, ants and bees). Here we sequence the genome and
   stage-specific transcriptomes of the dampwood termite Zootermopsis
   nevadensis (Blattodea) and compare them with similar data for eusocial
   Hymenoptera, to better identify commonalities and differences in
   achieving this significant transition. We show an expansion of genes
   related to male fertility, with upregulated gene expression in male
   reproductive individuals reflecting the profound differences in mating
   biology relative to the Hymenoptera. For several chemoreceptor families,
   we show divergent numbers of genes, which may correspond to the more
   claustral lifestyle of these termites. We also show similarities in the
   number and expression of genes related to caste determination
   mechanisms. Finally, patterns of DNA methylation and alternative
   splicing support a hypothesized epigenetic regulation of caste
   differentiation.}},

Title = {{Slow Noise in the Period of a Biological Oscillator Underlies Gradual
   Trends and Abrupt Transitions in Phasic Relationships in Hybrid Neural
   Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In order to study the ability of coupled neural oscillators to
   synchronize in the presence of intrinsic as opposed to synaptic noise,
   we constructed hybrid circuits consisting of one biological and one
   computational model neuron with reciprocal synaptic inhibition using the
   dynamic clamp. Uncoupled, both neurons fired periodic trains of action
   potentials. Most coupled circuits exhibited qualitative changes between
   one-to-one phase-locking with fairly constant phasic relationships and
   phase slipping with a constant progression in the phasic relationships
   across cycles. The phase resetting curve (PRC) and intrinsic periods
   were measured for both neurons, and used to construct a map of the
   firing intervals for both the coupled and externally forced (PRC
   measurement) conditions. For the coupled network, a stable fixed point
   of the map predicted phase locking, and its absence produced phase
   slipping. Repetitive application of the map was used to calibrate
   different noise models to simultaneously fit the noise level in the
   measurement of the PRC and the dynamics of the hybrid circuit
   experiments. Only a noise model that added history-dependent variability
   to the intrinsic period could fit both data sets with the same parameter
   values, as well as capture bifurcations in the fixed points of the map
   that cause switching between slipping and locking. We conclude that the
   biological neurons in our study have slowly-fluctuating stochastic
   dynamics that confer history dependence on the period. Theoretical
   results to date on the behavior of ensembles of noisy biological
   oscillators may require re-evaluation to account for transitions induced
   by slow noise dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United
   States and new treatment options are greatly needed. Oxidative stress is
   increased following myocardial infarction and levels of antioxidants
   decrease, causing imbalance that leads to dysfunction. Therapy involving
   catalase, the endogenous scavenger of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), has been
   met with mixed results. When over-expressed in cardiomyocytes from
   birth, catalase improves function following injury. When expressed in
   the same cells in an inducible manner, catalase showed a time-dependent
   response with no acute benefit, but a chronic benefit due to altered
   remodeling. In myeloid cells, catalase over-expression reduced
   angiogenesis during hindlimb ischemia and prevented monocyte migration.
   In the present study, due to the large inflammatory response following
   infarction, we examined myeloid-specific catalase over-expression on
   post-infarct healing. We found a significant increase in catalase levels
   following infarction that led to a decrease in H2O2 levels, leading to
   improved acute function. This increase in function could be attributed
   to reduced infarct size and improved angiogenesis. Despite these initial
   improvements, there was no improvement in chronic function, likely due
   to increased fibrosis. These data combined with what has been previously
   shown underscore the need for temporal, cell-specific catalase delivery
   as a potential therapeutic option.}},

Abstract = {{We use three-dimensional computer simulations to examine the free
   swimming of an elastic plate plunging sinusoidally in a viscous fluid
   with a Reynolds number of 250. We find that the free swimming velocity
   is maximized when the swimmer is driven near the first natural frequency
   leading to larger swimmer deformations, and that the free swimming
   velocity is nearly linearly related to the trailing edge displacement.
   The maximum swimmer performance is found at a non-resonance frequency.
   The maximum performance takes place when the swimmer exhibits a
   deformation pattern in which the transverse displacement of the
   swimmer's center of mass is minimized, which in turn reduces viscous
   losses. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{With Au nanocages as an example, we recently demonstrated that
   radioactive Au-198 could be incorporated into the crystal lattice of Au
   nanostructures for simple and reliable quantification of their in vivo
   biodistribution by measuring the gamma radiation from Au-198 decay and
   for optical imaging by detecting the Cerenkov radiation. Here we extend
   the capability of this strategy to synthesize radioactive Au-198
   nanostructures with a similar size but different shapes and then compare
   their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution using
   a murine EMT6 breast cancer model. Specifically, we investigated Au
   nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages. After PEGylation,
   an aqueous suspension of the radioactive Au nanostructures was injected
   into a tumor-bearing mouse intravenously, and their biodistribution was
   measured from the gamma radiation while their tumor uptake was directly
   imaged using the Cerenkov radiation. Significantly higher tumor uptake
   was observed for the Au nanospheres and nanodisks relative to the Au
   nanorods and nanocages at 24 h postinjection. Furthermore,
   autoradiographic imaging was performed on thin slices of the tumor after
   excision to resolve the intratumoral distributions of the
   nanostructures. While both the Au nanospheres and nanodisks were only
   observed on the surfaces of the tumors, the Au nanorods and nanocages
   were distributed throughout the tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically oriented Ta-W-O nanotube array films were fabricated via the
   anodization of Ta-W alloy foils in HF-containing electrolytes. HF
   concentration is a key parameter in achieving well-adhered nanotube
   array structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse
   reflectance measurements confirm the staggered band-alignment between
   Ta2O5 and WO3, which facilitates the separation of charge carriers. The
   nanotubes made of Ta-W films containing 10\% W showed 100-fold
   improvement in the measured photocurrent compared to pristine Ta2O5 upon
   their use to split water photoelectrochemically. This enhancement was
   related to the efficient charge transport and the red shift In
   absorption spectrum with increase of the W content, which was asserted
   by ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements. The TA
   measurements showed the elimination of trap states upon annealing Ta-W-O
   nanotubes and, hence, minimizing the charge carrier trapping, whereas
   the trap states remain in pristine Ta2O5 nanotubes even after annealing.}},

Abstract = {{A 60 wt\% boron nitride (BN)-40 wt\% silica (SiO2) hot-pressed
   composite, denoted as M26, was used as the insulating chamber wall for a
   xenon plasma Hall-effect thruster operated for approximately 2000 h at
   power levels between 1.5 and 5 kW. The chamber wall showed a range of
   erosion microstructures. In the heavily eroded regions, striations in
   the surface topology were evident with surface protrusions in the
   generic shape of conical tips consisting of stratified BN and silica
   phases. Microcracking along the long axis of the BN basal plane was
   prevalent. Through a two-dimensional finite element model, the
   microcracking has been determined to occur because of the anisotropic
   thermal expansion of BN in the amorphous silica matrix. Exfoliation
   accompanied the microcracking in BN and resulted in the preferential
   loss of BN as compared with silica in these heavily eroded regions.}},

Abstract = {{Flow distortion in a 5\% scale model of a blended-wing-body,

   speeds (up to M = 0.55) using integrated, hybrid actuators comprised of
   tandem configurations of passive (vanes) and active (synthetic jets)
   flow control elements. The inlet flow of the model diffuser is
   conditioned to simulate the inlet flow of an airborne blended-wing-body
   offset diffuser by implementation of a novel boundary layer fence. It is
   shown that flow distortion at the engine face is reduced by each of the
   passive and active elements, and the reduction is even more significant
   when both actuation approaches are implemented, concurrently, over the
   entire range of test Mach numbers. Hybrid actuation yields an overall
   distortion reduction of 35\% at the design flow condition (M = 0.55)
   using a control system that is fail safe and does not require an

Abstract = {{The intermetallic compound (IMC) evolution and the thermal-mechanical
   reliability of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder joints were studied using
   air-to-air thermal shock testing of 100-mu m-pitch peripheral-row flip
   chip assemblies. Flip chips assembled on organic substrates were
   subjected to air-to-air thermal shock testing between 55 degrees C and
   125 degrees C, and the samples were removed at regular intervals for
   cross-sectioning and failure analysis. It was seen that on the die side,
   after 2000 cycles, all of the (Cu,Ni)(3)Sn-4 had transferred to
   (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 due to strong cross-pad interaction between the chip-side
   Ni pad and substrate-side Cu pad, and thus, there was no premature
   solder cracking possibly due to the absence of dual IMC structure. On
   the substrate-side Cu interface, the Cu3Sn growth was hindered, and thus
   there was very little increase in Kirkendall voids in the Cu3Sn after
   2000 cycles. Therefore, there was no premature brittle failure in the
   intermetallic. Failure analysis shows that the cracks in the outermost
   corner solder joint started to form after 2000 cycles near the chip-side
   pad, and the cracks propagated in the solder matrix around the IMC like
   a ring to create solder open. From the experimental data, crack
   propagation rate equation parameters and characteristic mean life were
   determined. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Self-powered nanosensors and nanosystems have attracted significant
   attention in the past decades and have gradually become the most
   desirable and promising prototype for environmental protection/detection
   because no battery is needed to power the device. Therefore, in this
   paper a design is proposed for a self-powered photodetector based on
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) configuration. 3D dendritic TiO2
   nanostructures are synthesized as the built-in UV photodetector as well
   as the contact material of the TENG. The cost-effective, robust, and
   easily fabricated TENG-based photodetector presents superior
   photoresponse characteristics, which include an excellent responsivity
   over 280 A W-1, rapid rise time (18 ms) and decay time (31 ms), and a
   wide detection range of light intensity from 20 mu W cm(-2) to 7 mW
   cm(-2). In the last part of the paper, a stand-alone and self-powered
   environmental sensing device is developed by applying poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates and springs to assemble the TENG-based
   photodetector. These results indicate that the new prototype sensing
   device based on the TENG configuration shows great potential as a
   self-powered photodetector.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) generally operates using
   two-electrodes to form a closed outer circuit loop without directly
   contacting ground. Here, a newly designed TENG, the two electrodes of
   which are grounded for doubling the energy output and the operation
   frequency, is introduced. The TENG operates in two modes: two-channel
   mode in which the two electrodes are simultaneously connected to the
   ground, and single-channel mode in which the two electrodes are
   alternately connected to the ground through a self-triggered vibrating
   switch. Both modes doubles the total charges to be transported compared
   to the traditional ungrounded TENG. For the single-channel TENG, about
   30 current peaks with an output frequency of 50 Hz are generated in a
   single cycle at a motion triggering frequency of 2 Hz. The output energy
   at a load lower than 10 MO of the single-channel TENG is enhanced, and
   the enhancing ratio is more than 100 at a load of 100 k Omega. The two
   electrodes grounded TENG provides a new strategy for effective use of
   the energy harvested from our living environment.}},

Abstract = {{Massive open online courses, online tutoring systems, and other computer
   homework systems are rapidly changing engineering education by providing
   increased student feedback and capitalizing upon online systems'
   scalability. While online homework systems provide great benefits, a
   growing concern among engineering educators is that students are losing
   both the critical art of sketching and the ability to take a real system
   and reduce it to an accurate but simplified free-body diagram (FBD). For
   example, some online systems allow the drag and drop of forces onto
   FBDs, but they do not allow the user to sketch the FBDs, which is a
   vital part of the learning process. In this paper, we discuss Mechanix,
   a sketch recognition tool that provides an efficient means for
   engineering students to learn how to draw truss FBDs and solve truss
   problems. The system allows students to sketch FBDs into a tablet
   computer or by using a mouse and a standard computer monitor. Using
   artificial intelligence, Mechanix can determine not only the component
   shapes and features of the diagram but also the relationships between
   those shapes and features. Because Mechanix is domain specific, it can
   use those relationships to determine not only whether a student's work
   is correct but also why it is incorrect. Mechanix is then able to
   provide immediate, constructive feedback to students without providing
   final answers. Within this manuscript, we document the inner workings of
   Mechanix, including the artificial intelligence behind the scenes, and
   present studies of the effects on student learning. The evaluations have
   shown that Mechanix is as effective as paper-and-pencil-based homework
   for teaching method of joints truss analysis; focus groups with students
   who used the program have revealed that they believe Mechanix enhances
   their learning and that they are highly engaged while using it.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method that utilizes the lineal-path function to ascertain a
   probability density function for the three-dimensional size distribution
   of entrained air voids directly from plane polished sections of hardened
   concrete is proposed. The results then treat the sparing factor in terms
   of a probabilistic maximum distance from a random point in the cement
   paste matrix to the periphery of an air void, where air voids are
   treated as a polydispersed sphere system. The model was applied to
   concretes with various air entrainment admixture types and dosages. The
   results suggest that the model may offer a better assessment of the
   system for use in assessing durability and studying admixtures, as well
   as providing a new tool for spatial characterization of heterogeneous
   and porous materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanorods were successfully prepared by a
   convenient solvothermal route. The crystal structure and morphology of
   AZO were characterized by XRD, SEM, and high-resolution TEM. The length
   and diameter of AZO nanorods decreased with increasing Al content. The
   optical and electrical properties of AZO were studied by UV/Vis
   spectroscopy and a four-point probe. The optical band gap of AZO
   increased initially because of the Burstein-Moss effect and then
   decreased as the Al content increased owing to the defects of AZO. The
   electrical resistivity of AZO nanorods varied conversely because of the
   change of electron and defect concentration (native and impurity
   defects). The native defect types, which were singly charged zinc and
   oxygen vacancies, were confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy.
   Moreover, not only the properties but also the growth mechanisms of AZO
   nanorods were affected by the defect concentrations of singly charged
   zinc vacancies and substituted Al, which were caused by increasing Al
   content. Finally, the AZO exhibited the smallest electrical resistivity
   with 1.5at.\% Al doping content, which was four orders of magnitude
   smaller than that of ZnO.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocatalysts based on Pt-Ni alloys have received considerable
   interest in recent years owing to their remarkable activities toward the
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the synthesis of
   nanosized Pt-Ni octahedra with a range of controlled sizes and
   compositions in an effort to optimize their ORR activities. If we
   employed benzyl ether as a solvent for the synthesis, we could readily
   control the edge lengths of the Pt-Ni octahedra in the range of 6-12nm
   and keep the Pt/Ni atomic ratio at around 2.4 by varying the amount of
   oleylamine added into the reaction system. If we adjusted the amount of
   Ni precursor, the atomic ratio of Pt to Ni in the Pt-Ni octahedra could
   be controlled in the range of 1.4-3.7 and their edge lengths were kept
   at 9nm. For the catalysts with a Pt/Ni atomic ratio around 2.4, their
   specific ORR activities (per unit surface area) increased monotonically
   as the edge length increased from 6 to 12nm. However, the mass
   activities (per unit mass of Pt) of these Pt-Ni octahedra showed a
   maximum value at an edge length of 9nm. The specific and mass activities
   for the Pt-Ni octahedra with an edge length of 9nm but different
   compositions both showed peak values at a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 2.4.}},

Abstract = {{Applications running on leadership platforms are more and more
   bottlenecked by storage input/output (I/O). In an effort to combat the
   increasing disparity between I/O throughput and compute capability, we
   created Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) in 2005. Focusing on putting users
   first with a service oriented architecture, we combined cutting edge
   research into new I/O techniques with a design effort to create near
   optimal I/O methods. As a result, ADIOS provides the highest level of
   synchronous I/O performance for a number of mission critical
   applications at various Department of Energy Leadership Computing
   Facilities. Meanwhile ADIOS is leading the push for next generation
   techniques including staging and data processing pipelines. In this
   paper, we describe the startling observations we have made in the last
   half decade of I/O research and development, and elaborate the lessons
   we have learned along this journey. We also detail some of the
   challenges that remain as we look toward the coming Exascale era.

Abstract = {{Fine-pitch electrical microbumps (25-mu m diameter and 50-mu m pitch)
   and annular-shaped fluidic microbumps (150-mu m inner diameter and
   210-mu m outer diameter) are presented to enable high-bandwidth
   die-to-die signaling, embedded microfluidic cooling and power delivery
   for silicon interposer and 3-D integrated electronic systems. Electrical
   and fluidic testing demonstrates good bonding of the electrical and
   fluidic microbumps; the average resistance of a single electrical
   microbump is 13.5 m Omega. The bonded fluidic microbumps are
   successfully tested up to 100 kPa without any leakage. Moreover, the
   power supply noise (PSN) of 3-D chip stacks is analyzed using a compact
   physical model. Based on the model, increasing the number of
   power/ground pads is effective in suppressing PSN, motivating the need
   for fine-pitch electrical microbumps. Impact of the number of dice in a
   stack, die thickness, and the area of on-die decoupling capacitors on
   PSN is also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based
   reduced-order modeling framework to improve spatial resolution of
   measured temperature data in an air-cooled data center. This data-driven
   approach is applied on transient air temperature data, acquired at the
   exhaust of a server simulator rack. Temperature data is collected by a
   distributed thermocouple network at 1 Hz sampling frequency following a
   step impulse in the rack heat load. The input data are organized in a
   2-D array, comprising transient temperature signals measured at various
   spatial locations. Because its computational time scales logarithmically
   with the input size, the proposed POD-based approach is potentially
   useful as an efficient tool for handling large transient data sets. With
   spatial location being the parameter for the input data matrix, the
   proposed approach is suitable for rapid synthesis of transient
   temperature data at new spatial locations. The comparison between
   POD-based local air temperature predictions and corresponding data
   indicates a maximum prediction uncertainty of 3.2\%, and root mean
   square prediction uncertainty of 1.9\%.}},

Abstract = {{Structural echoes of underwater elastic targets, used for detection and
   classification purposes, can be highly localized in the time-frequency
   domain and can be aspect-dependent. Hence such structural echoes
   recorded along a distributed (synthetic) aperture, e. g., using a moving
   receiver platform, would not meet the stationarity and multiple
   snapshots requirements of common subspace array processing methods used
   for denoising array data based on their estimated covariance matrix. To
   address this issue, this article introduces a subspace array processing
   method based on the space-time-frequency distribution (STFD) of
   single-snapshots of non-stationary signals. This STFD is obtained by
   computing Cohen's class time-frequency distributions between all
   pairwise combination of the recorded signals along an arbitrary aperture
   array. This STFD is interpreted as a generalized array covariance matrix
   which automatically accounts for the inherent coherence across the
   time-frequency plane of the received nonstationary echoes emanating from
   the same target. Hence, identifying the signal's subspace from the
   eigenstructure of this STFD provides a means for denoising these
   non-stationary structural echoes by spreading the clutter and noise
   power in the time-frequency domain; as demonstrated here numerically and
   experimentally using the structural echoes of a thin steel spherical
   shell measured along a synthetic aperture. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society

Abstract = {{Although chemically inert nanosize mineral fillers have been shown to
   modify early cement hydration kinetics, with the effects dependent upon
   usage rate, particle size, and dispersibility, the effects of such
   fillers on the apparent activation energy (E-a) of cement has not been
   previously examined. Here, cement E-a was calculated from isothermal
   calorimetry performed at different temperatures with two different types
   of fillers (i.e., titanium dioxide and limestone) using a linear method
   as well as a modified ASTM C1074 method. The use of both types of
   nanoparticles increased the rate of cement hydration as well as
   accelerated the reaction rate, due to heterogeneous nucleation effect,
   as previously demonstrated. E-a increased in the presence of nanosized
   fillers, demonstrating an increased temperature sensitivity of the
   filler-cement composites relative to ordinary cement. These results show
   that chemically inert nanoparticles behave fundamentally differently
   compared with supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and
   silica fume which instead decrease temperature sensitivity. The
   increased temperature sensitivity could thus be used to modify and
   optimize the reaction mechanism and kinetics of cement hydration,
   especially to increase the rate of cement hydration, to decrease setting
   time, and to achieve faster strength gain accounting for higher or lower
   temperatures during curing.}},

Abstract = {{In the theory of dislocations, the Burgers vector is usually defined by
   referring to a crystal structure. Using the notion of affine development
   of curves on a differential manifold with a connection, we give a
   differential geometric definition of the Burgers vector directly in the
   continuum setting, without making use of an underlying crystal
   structure. As opposed to some other approaches to the continuum
   definition of the Burgers vector, our definition is completely
   geometric, in the sense that it involves no ambiguous operations such as
   the integration of a vector field: when we integrate a vector field, it
   is a vector field living in the tangent space at a given point in the
   manifold. For a body with distributed dislocations, the material
   manifold, which describes the geometry of the stress-free state of the
   body, is commonly taken to be a Weitzenbock manifold, i.e. a manifold
   with a metric-compatible, flat connection with torsion. We show that for
   such a manifold, the density of the Burgers vector calculated according
   to our definition reproduces the commonly stated relation between the
   density of dislocations and the torsion tensor.}},

Title = {{Combined iterative reconstruction and image-domain decomposition for
   dual energy CT using total-variation regularization}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Dual-energy CT (DECT) is being increasingly used for its
   capability of material decomposition and energy-selective imaging. A
   generic problem of DECT, however, is that the decomposition process is
   unstable in the sense that the relative magnitude of decomposed signals
   is reduced due to signal cancellation while the image noise is
   accumulating from the two CT images of independent scans. Direct image
   decomposition, therefore, leads to severe degradation of signal-to-noise
   ratio on the resultant images. Existing noise suppression techniques are
   typically implemented in DECT with the procedures of reconstruction and
   decomposition performed independently, which do not explore the
   statistical properties of decomposed images during the reconstruction
   for noise reduction. In this work, the authors propose an iterative
   approach that combines the reconstruction and the signal decomposition
   procedures to minimize the DECT image noise without noticeable loss of
   resolution.
   Methods: The proposed algorithm is formulated as an optimization
   problem, which balances the data fidelity and total variation of
   decomposed images in one framework, and the decomposition step is
   carried out iteratively together with reconstruction. The noise in the
   CT images from the proposed algorithm becomes well correlated even
   though the noise of the raw projections is independent on the two CT
   scans. Due to this feature, the proposed algorithm avoids noise
   accumulation during the decomposition process. The authors evaluate the
   method performance on noise suppression and spatial resolution using
   phantom studies and compare the algorithm with conventional denoising
   approaches as well as combined iterative reconstruction methods with
   different forms of regularization.
   Results: On the Catphan(C)600 phantom, the proposed method outperforms
   the existing denoising methods on preserving spatial resolution at the
   same level of noise suppression, i.e., a reduction of noise standard
   deviation by one order of magnitude. This improvement is mainly
   attributed to the high noise correlation in the CT images reconstructed
   by the proposed algorithm. Iterative reconstruction using different
   regularization, including quadratic or q-generalized Gaussian Markov
   random field regularization, achieves similar noise suppression from
   high noise correlation. However, the proposed TV regularization obtains
   a better edge preserving performance. Studies of electron density
   measurement also show that our method reduces the average estimation
   error from 9.5\% to 7.1\%. On the anthropomorphic head phantom, the
   proposed method suppresses the noise standard deviation of the
   decomposed images by a factor of similar to 14 without blurring the fine
   structures in the sinus area.
   Conclusions: The authors propose a practical method for DECT imaging
   reconstruction, which combines the image reconstruction and material
   decomposition into one optimization framework. Compared to the existing
   approaches, our method achieves a superior performance on DECT imaging
   with respect to decomposition accuracy, noise reduction, and spatial
   resolution. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Among conducting polymers, PEDOT:PSS is a promising electrode material
   for supercapacitors, due to stability and simple processability of the
   polymer. However, a thin film of spin coated PEDOT:PSS shows a compact
   structure with relatively low double layer capacitance. In order to
   enhance the film porosity, a surfactant (Triton X-100) has been added to
   the polymer solution before spin coating. In this work, the effect of
   concentration of Triton X-100 on the double layer capacitance and
   conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film has been studied. Different
   electrodes were fabricated with PEDOT:PSS samples that were prepared
   with different levels of Triton X-100. A peak specific double layer
   capacitance of 20 F/g was achieved in the electrode with 3.0 wt\% of
   Triton X-100 which was similar to 10 times larger than the capacitance
   in the electrodes with 0.0 and 5.0 wt\% surfactant. Additionally, the
   conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films were enhanced with application of
   Triton X-100 by at least 20 times. The SEM (scanning electron
   microscopy) images of the electrodes show correlation that the increase
   in capacitance with 3.0 wt\% surfactant was due to the augmentation of
   porosity of the films structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4 H2O, denoted as MSM)
   on electroless nickel phosphorus (ENP) deposition in acidic bath were
   systematically investigated with the deposition rate, crystallinity,
   elemental composition and surface morphology of ENP deposit. MSM was
   found to act as a stabilizer because the addition of MSM significantly
   improved the stability of the ENP plating bath. During the stabilizing
   process, the increase of pH decreased the ENP deposition rate, which is
   opposite to the conventional concept that higher bath pH gives rise to
   higher deposition rate. According to these results with the calculated
   hydrolysis constant of MSM in acid solution, we confirmed that the
   chemical species to realize stabilizing action was MnOH+. This
   hypothesis well interpreted the results obtained from the experiments
   including the bath stability, the MSM and pH effects on the deposition
   rate and the MSM and pH effects on elemental composition. The proposal
   of MnOH+. also successfully elaborated the MSM stabilizing actions by
   the mechanism of anion absorption on nickel catalytic sites. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Researchers have developed computer-aided decision support systems for
   translational medicine that aim to objectively and efficiently diagnose
   cancer using histopathological images. However, the performance of such
   systems is confounded by nonbiological experimental variations or
   ``batch effects{''} that can commonly occur in histopathological data,
   especially when images are acquired using different imaging devices and
   patient samples. This is even more problematic in large-scale studies in
   which cross-laboratory sharing of large volumes of data is necessary.
   Batch effects can change quantitative morphological image features and
   decrease the prediction performance. Using four batches of renal tumor
   images, we compare one image-level and five feature-level batch effect
   removal methods. Principal component variation analysis shows that batch
   is a large source of variance in image features. Results show that
   feature-level normalization methods reduce batch-contributed variance to
   almost zero. Moreover, feature-level normalization, especially ComBatN,
   improves crossbatch and combined-batch prediction performance. Compared
   to no normalization, ComBatN improves performance in 83\% and 90\% of
   cross-batch and combined-batch prediction models, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for the harmonic-balance analysis and design of
   rotary-traveling wave oscillator is presented. Two different
   implementations are compared. The first one is the standard
   configuration based on a distributed transmission lines. The second one
   is a new configuration based on a differential nonlinear transmission
   line (NLTL), which enables the generation of square waveforms with
   reduced number of stages, while still maintaining the capability to
   produce multiphase signals. The possible coexistence of oscillation
   modes is investigated with a detailed bifurcation analysis versus
   practical parameters such as the device bias voltage. The phase-noise
   spectrum is predicted from the variance of the common phase deviation.
   The parameters that determine this variance are identified with the
   conversion-matrix approach. The two prototypes, based on a distributed
   transmission line and a differential NLTL, have been manufactured and
   characterized experimentally, obtaining very good agreement between
   simulations and measurements.}},

   CNT-oxide system shows very fast intratube energy transfer in a CNT from
   high-frequency band to intermediate-frequency bands. The low frequency
   phonon band (0-5 THz) of top CNT shows two-stage energy relaxation which
   results from the efficient coupling of low frequency phonons in the

Abstract = {{The planned life extension of nuclear reactors throughout the US and
   abroad will cause reactor vessel and internals materials to be exposed
   to more neutron irradiation than was originally intended. A
   nonde-structive evaluation (NDE) method to monitor radiation damage
   would enable safe and cost-effective continued operation of nuclear
   reactors. Radiation damage in reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels
   causes microstructural changes that leave the material in an embrittled
   state. Nonlinear ultrasound is an NDE technique quantified by the
   measurable acoustic nonlinearity parameter, which is sensitive to
   microstructural changes in metallic materials such as dislocations,
   precipitates and their combinations. Recent research has demonstrated
   the sensitivity of the acoustic nonlinearity parameter to increasing
   neutron fluence in representative RPV steels. The current work considers
   nonlinear ultrasonic experiments conducted on similar RPV steel samples
   that had a combination of irradiation, annealing, re-irradiation, and/or
   re-annealing to a total neutron fluence of 0.5-5 x 10(19) n/cm(2) (E > 1
   MeV) at an irradiation temperature of 290 degrees C. The acoustic
   nonlinearity parameter generally increased with increasing neutron
   fluence, and consistently decreased from the irradiated to the annealed
   state over different levels of neutron fluence. Results of the measured
   acoustic nonlinearity parameter are compared with those from previous
   measurements on other RPV steel samples. This comprehensive set of
   results illustrates the dependence of the measured acoustic nonlinearity
   parameter on neutron fluence, material composition, irradiation
   temperature and annealing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bandwidth-sharing networks as considered by Roberts and Massoulie {[}28]
   (Roberts JW, Massoulie L (1998) Bandwidth sharing and admission control
   for elastic traffic. Proc. ITC Specialist Seminar, Yokohama, Japan)
   provide a natural modeling framework for describing the dynamic
   flow-level interaction among elastic data transfers. Under mild
   assumptions, it has been established that a wide family of so-called
   alpha-fair bandwidth-sharing strategies achieve stability in such
   networks provided that no individual link is overloaded.
   In the present paper we focus on bandwidth-sharing networks where the
   load on one or several of the links exceeds the capacity. To
   characterize the overload behavior, we examine the fluid limit, which
   emerges when the flow dynamics are scaled in both space and time. We
   derive a functional equation characterizing the fluid limit, and show
   that any strictly positive solution must be unique, which in particular
   implies the convergence of the scaled number of flows to the fluid limit
   for nonzero initial states when the load is sufficiently high. For the
   case of a zero initial state and a zero-degree homogeneous rate
   allocation function, we show that there exists a linear solution to the
   fluid-limit equation, and obtain a fixed-point equation for the
   corresponding asymptotic growth rates. It is proved that a fixed-point
   solution is also a solution to a related strictly concave optimization
   problem, and hence exists and is unique. In addition, we establish
   uniqueness of fluid-model solutions for monotone rate-preserving
   networks (in particular tree networks).}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators, because the
   amorphous arrangement of the molecular chains reduces the mean free path
   of heat-conducting phonons. The most common method to increase thermal
   conductivity is to draw polymeric fibres, which increases chain
   alignment and crystallinity, but creates a material that currently has
   limited thermal applications. Here we show that pure polythiophene
   nanofibres can have a thermal conductivity up to similar to 4.4 W
   m(-1)K(-1) (more than 20 times higher than the bulk polymer value) while
   remaining amorphous. This enhancement results from significant molecular
   chain orientation along the fibre axis that is obtained during
   electropolymerization using nanoscale templates. Thermal conductivity
   data suggest that, unlike in drawn crystalline fibres, in our fibres the
   dominant phonon-scattering process at room temperature is still related
   to structural disorder. Using vertically aligned arrays of nanofibres,
   we demonstrate effective heat transfer at critical contacts in
   electronic devices operating under high-power conditions at 200 degrees
   C over numerous cycles.}},

   separately. Polypeptide composite particles (PCPs) are a newly expanding
   field of hybrid materials with potential future impact in a broad
   variety of applications. In this review, we present an overview about
   the progress made on designing PCPs. Past and present limitations in the
   fabrication of the cores and shells alone will be outlined. A special
   emphasis will be placed on the future challenges directed to design
   better materials by expanding the architectural repertoire which will
   benefit their functionality and their range of applications. The review
   also presents possible future trends and challenges in engineering
   polypeptide-based materials as platforms for targeted applications.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report a novel and facile way to grow the vertically aligned ZnO
   nanowall on both sides of the flexible substrate through
   low-temperature, cost-effective hydrothermal method and their
   application toward energy harvesting application. The fabricated
   nanogenerator device structure consists of a ZnO nanowall structure on
   the both sides of the flexible substrates covered with poly(methyl
   methacrylate), and gold (Au) coating on both sides acts as an electrode.
   The fabricated nanowall nanogenerator produces the maximum output
   voltage and current of 2.5 V and 80 nA respectively, with maximum power
   output of 0.2 mu W.cm(-2), when folding the device through the finger.
   Furthermore, we studied the performance of the nanogenerator device with
   different load resistance. The voltage and current were linearly varied
   with the load resistance. The maximum power output (37.7 nW.cm(-2)) was
   measured at load resistance of 75 M Omega The fabricated device showed
   the capability by driving a commercial green LED and LCD with the help
   of the capacitor. The experimental results confirmed the ZnO nanowall as
   a good candidate for energy harvesting application.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional intersection designs have been receiving increased
   consideration at intersections that serve high traffic demands. Although
   operational performance of unconventional intersections has been
   evaluated in a number of studies, little research has been conducted
   regarding methodologies to obtain optimal signal timings for them.
   Several studies have reported that commercial signal timing packages
   have not been able to be utilized to develop optimal signal timings due
   to the unique design features of the unconventional intersections. In
   this paper a Monte Carlo simulation method to minimize intersection
   delay is described as well as a bandwidth maximization method for a
   Displaced Left-Turn (DLT) intersection, one of the most popular
   unconventional intersections. The proposed method is applied to a
   representative intersection design for two different traffic demand
   scenarios. It is seen that the two optimization approaches may result in
   different optimal solutions and the Monte Carlo simulation is able to
   provide near-optimum parameter selection ranges for the given traffic
   demands. Also, it is found that the Monte Carlo method is sufficiently
   flexible to provide intersection-tailored solutions with intersection
   specific design parameters.}},

   multiplicative decomposition is assumed for the assumed thermoelastic
   orthotropic expansional strains of the respective crystallites. The
   properties of the crystallites are allowed to depend both on current
   temperature and their respective temperatures of formation. The entropy
   production rate relation is written in the frame rotating with the
   logarithmic spin and produces stress and entropy relations incorporating
   the integrated configurational free energies, and a driving term for the
   crystallization analogous to that obtained by the previous studies of
   Rao et al. The salient attributes of the 1-D modeling of Westbrook et

   mixtures of silica particles}},
Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{44-50}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Overconsolidated soils are ubiquitous in nature due to multiple
   mechanisms; however, the stress-history-based studies of small strain
   stiffness on binary mixtures, such as silty sand, are limited even
   though natural sand deposits are commonly mixtures of sand particles
   with varying amounts of fines. Consequently, this study quantified the
   stress-history-based dynamic properties of binary mixtures, such as
   sand-sand mixtures with different size small particles, and silty sand
   mixtures with small amounts of non-plastic fines, up to the critical
   fines content. By performing bender element tests on those mixtures
   according to fines content, size ratio, and overconsolidation ratio, the
   stress-history-based G(max) of binary mixtures was evaluated. For the
   relevant data analysis, the OCR (overconsolidation ratio) exponent in
   the Gm formulation was expressed in terms of stress exponents during
   loading and unloading. It was found that the effect of OCR on the
   estimation of Gm increased with a decrease in size ratio (or increase in
   size difference), since the stress exponents during loading increased
   more significantly with a decrease in size ratio due to the pronounced
   change in interparticle coordination between large grains. However, the
   variation of stress exponents during unloading of different mixtures was
   relatively small due to the prevalent elastic deformation. It was
   demonstrated that the maximum stress history effect of tested mixed
   soils was observed at a fines content of approximately 5\%, which was
   smaller than critical fines content of silty sand. This behavior was
   attributable to the delay in critical fines content observed during
   unloading, when compared to that observed during loading. Published by

   this silica-supported iridium complex shows moderate to good catalytic
   activity in the aromatic C H borylation of a variety of substrates. More
   importantly, the heterogeneous catalyst is recovered easily and reused

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine the optimal storage temperature
   to minimise degradation of salivary s-IgA for field-based surveillance
   applications in resource-limited settings.
   MethodsSaliva samples from 40 Zambian adults were stored at +25 degrees
   C, +4 degrees C, -20 degrees C, and -80 degrees C and each tested by
   ELISA for salivary s-IgA concentration at 0, 1, 2, 7, and 15 days.
   Differences were determined among concentrations over time and
   temperature compared with baseline values. Kruskal-Wallis tests were
   applied to analyse variance. Single and multivariate regression analyses
   estimated the influence of storage time and temperature on recoverable
   s-IgA.
   ResultsResults revealed a statistically significant decrease in salivary
   s-IgA concentration as storage time increased and as temperature
   decreased. Degradation during storage time was most pronounced at lower
   temperatures.
   Conclusionss-IgA is stable at ambient temperatures in Zambia for at
   least 15 days, suggesting no need for cold chain handling before

Abstract = {{This study aimed to improve the thermostability of alkaline
   alpha-amylase from Alkalimonas amylolytica through structure-based
   rational design and systems engineering of its catalytic domain.
   Separate engineering strategies were used to increase alkaline
   alpha-amylase thermostability: (1) replace histidine residues with
   leucine to stabilize the least similar region in domain B, (2) change
   residues (glycine, proline, and glutamine) to stabilize the highly
   conserved alpha-helices in domain A, and (3) decrease the free energy of
   folding predicted by the PoPMuSiC program to stabilize the overall
   protein structure. A total of 15 single-site mutants were obtained, and
   four mutants - H209L, Q226V, N302W, and P477V - showed enhanced
   thermostability. Combinational mutations were subsequently introduced,
   and the best mutant was triple mutant H209L/Q226V/P477V. Its half-life
   at 60 A degrees C was 3.8-fold of that of the wild type and displayed a
   3.2 A degrees C increase in melting temperature compared with that of
   the wild type. Interestingly, other biochemical properties of this
   mutant also improved: the optimum temperature increased from 50 A
   degrees C to 55 A degrees C, the optimum pH shifted from 9.5 to 10.0,
   the stable pH range expanded from 7.0-11.0 to 6.0-12.0, the specific
   activity increased by 24 \%, and the catalytic efficiency (k (cat)/K
   (m)) increased from 1.8x10(4) to 3.5 x 10(4) l/(g min). Finally, the
   mechanisms responsible for the increased thermostability were analyzed
   through comparative analysis of structure models. The structure-based
   rational design and systems engineering strategies in this study may
   also improve the thermostability of other industrial enzymes.}},

Title = {{Characterization of modular bifunctional processive endoglucanase Cel5

Abstract = {{Cel5 from marine Hahella chejuensis is composed of glycoside hydrolase
   family-5 (GH5) catalytic domain (CD) and two carbohydrate binding
   modules (CBM6-2). The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and
   purified to homogeneity. The optimum endoglucanase and xylanase
   activities of recombinant Cel5 were observed at 65 A degrees C, pH 6.5
   and 55 A degrees C, pH 5.5, respectively. It exhibited K (m) of 1.8 and
   7.1 mg/ml for carboxymethyl cellulose and birchwood xylan, respectively.
   The addition of Ca2+ greatly improved thermostability and endoglucanase
   activity of Cel5. The Cel5 retained 90 \% of its endoglucanase activity
   after 24 h incubation in presence of 5 M concentration of NaCl.
   Recombinant Cel5 showed production of cellobiose after hydrolysis of
   cellulosic substrates (soluble/insoluble) and methylglucuronic acid
   substituted xylooligosaccharides after hydrolysis of glucuronoxylans by
   endo-wise cleavage. These results indicated that Cel5 as bifunctional
   enzyme having both processive endoglucanase and xylanase activities. The
   multidomain structure of Cel5 is clearly distinguished from the GH5
   bifunctional glycoside hydrolases characterized to date, which are
   single domain enzymes. Sequence analysis and homology modeling suggested
   presence of two conserved binding sites with different substrate
   specificities in CBM6-2 and a single catalytic site in CD. Residues
   Glu132 and Glu219 were identified as key catalytic amino acids by
   sequence alignment and further verified by using site directed
   mutagenesis. CBM6-2 plays vital role in catalytic activity and
   thermostability of Cel5. The bifunctional activities and multiple
   substrate specificities of Cel5 can be utilized for efficient hydrolysis
   of cellulose and hemicellulose into soluble sugars.}},

Abstract = {{The moment when Electrical Vehicle (EV) starts charging or discharging
   is one of the most important parameters in estimating the impact of EV
   load on the grid. In this paper, a decision-making problem of
   determining the start time of charging and discharging during allowed
   period is proposed and studied under the uncertainty of real-time price.
   Prospect theory is utilized in the decision-making problem of this paper
   for it describes a kind of decision making behaviors under uncertainty.
   The case study uses the parameters of Springo SGM7001EV and adopts the
   historical real-time locational marginal pricing (LMP) data of PJM
   market for scenario reduction. Prospect values are calculated for every
   possible start time in the allowed charging or discharging period. By
   comparing the calculated prospect values, the optimal decisions are
   obtained accordingly and the results are compared with those based on
   Expected Utility Theory. Results show that with different initial
   State-of-Charge (SoC(0)) and different reference points, the optimal
   start time of charging can be the one between 12 a.m. to 3 a.m. and
   optimal discharging starts at 2 p.m. or 3p.m. Moreover, the decision

Abstract = {{The feasibility of flying a crewed lifting body, such as the HL-20,
   during entry from low Earth orbit without the steady-state body flap
   deflections required for angle-of-attack control was evaluated. This
   entry strategy mitigates the severity of the aerothermal environment on
   the vehicle's body flaps and reserves control power for transient
   steering maneuvers. A real-time numeric predictor-corrector entry
   guidance algorithm was developed to accommodate the range of vehicle
   trim angle-of-attack profiles possible in the absence of angle-of-attack
   control. Results show that it is feasible to steer the vehicle from low
   Earth orbit to a desired target with real-time guidance while satisfying
   a reasonable suite of trajectory constraints, including limits on peak
   heat rate, peak sensed deceleration, and integrated heat load.
   Uncertainty analyses confirm this result and show that the vehicle
   maintains significant performance robustness to expected day-of-flight
   uncertainties. Additionally, parametric scans over mission design
   parameters of interest indicate that a high level of flexibility is
   available for the low-Earth-orbit return mission. Together, these
   results indicate that the proposed entry strategy is feasible: Crewed
   lifting bodies may be effectively flown without steady-state body flap
   deflections.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Air traffic operations at and around major airports in the United States
   are in need of improvement. From the perspective of arrivals, when one
   or more runways are in great demand, unnecessary delay and emissions
   occur during peak periods at major airports while other runways at the
   same airport are operating under capacity. The primary cause of this
   imbalance in runway utilization is that traffic flow into and out of
   terminal areas is asymmetric (as a result of airline scheduling
   practices) and arrivals are typically assigned to the runway nearest the
   fix through which they enter the terminal area. From the perspective of
   departures, delays and emissions are incurred because arrivals take
   precedence over departures with regard to the utilization of runways
   (despite the absence of binding safety constraints) and because arrival
   trajectories often include level segments that ensure ``procedural
   separation{''} from arriving traffic while planes are not allowed to
   climb unrestricted along the most direct path to their destination. This
   paper presents an optimization model for simultaneously assigning
   aircraft to runways and scheduling the arrival and departure operations
   on these runways such that the total emissions produced in the terminal
   area and on the airport surface are minimized. Model constraints include

Abstract = {{Red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are indispensable tools for deep-tissue
   imaging, fluorescence resonance energy transfer applications, and
   super-resolution microscopy. Using time-resolved optical spectroscopy
   this study investigated photoinduced dynamics of three RFPs, KillerRed,

   intermediate was observed, which decays on a microsecond millisecond
   time scale. This intermediate is characterized by red-shifted absorption
   at 1.68-1.72 eV (lambda(max) = 720-740 nm). On the basis of electronic
   structure calculations, experimental evidence, and published literature,
   the chemical nature of the intermediate is assigned to an unusual
   open-shell dianionic chromophore (dianion-radical) formed via
   photoreduction. A doubly charged state that is not stable in the

Journal = {{METABOLIC ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{In previous work, we constructed a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain
   for microbial production of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which has
   applications in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. In this work, we
   improve GlcNAc production through modular engineering of B. subtilis.
   Specifically, the GlcNAc synthesis-related metabolic network in B.
   subtilis was divided into three modules GlcNAc synthesis, glycolysis,
   and peptidoglycan synthesis. First, two-promoter systems with different
   promoter types and strengths were used for combinatorial assembly of
   expression cassettes of glmS (encoding GlcN-6-phosphate synthase) and
   GNA1 (encoding GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) at
   transcriptional levels in the GlcNAc synthesis module, resulting in a
   32.4\% increase in GlcNAc titer (from 1.85 g/L to 245 g/L) in shake
   flasks. In addition, lactate and acetate synthesis were blocked by
   knockout of ldh (encoding lactate dehydrogenase) and pta (encoding
   phosphotransacetylase), leading to a 44.9\% increase in GlcNAc
   production (from 2.45 g/L to 3.55 g/L) in shake flasks. Then, various
   strengths of the glycolysis and peptidoglycan synthesis modules were
   constructed by repressing the expression of pfk (encoding
   6-phosphofructokinase) and glmM (encoding phosphoglucosamine mutase) via
   the expression of various combinations of synthetic small regulatory
   RNAs and Hfq protein. Next, GlcNAc, glycolysis, and peptidoglycan
   synthesis modules with various strengths were assembled and optimized
   via a module engineering approach, and the GlcNAc titer was improved to
   8.30 g/L from 3.55 g/L in shake flasks. Finally, the GlcNAc titer was
   further increased to 31.65 g/L, which was 3.8-fold that in the shake
   flask, in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor. This work significantly enhanced
   GlcNAc production through modular pathway engineering of B. subtilis,
   and the engineering strategies used herein may be useful for the
   construction of versatile B. subtilis cell factories for the production
   of other industrially important chemicals. (C) 2014 International

Abstract = {{The formulation of multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization
   (MDAO) problems has become increasingly complex as the number of
   analysis tools and design variables included in typical studies has
   grown. This growth in the scale and scope of MDAO problems has been
   motivated by the need to incorporate additional disciplines and to
   expand the parametric design space to enable the exploration of
   unconventional design concepts. In this context, given a large set of
   disciplinary analysis tools, the problem of determining a feasible data
   flow between tools to produce a specified set of system-level outputs is
   combinatorially challenging. The difficulty is compounded in
   multi-fidelity problems, which are of increasing interest to the MDAO
   community. In this paper, we propose an approach for addressing this
   problem based on the formalism of graph theory. The approach begins by
   constructing the maximal connectivity graph (MCG) describing all
   possible interconnections between a set of analysis tools. Graph
   operations are then conducted to reduce the MCG to a fundamental problem
   graph (FPG) that describes the connectivity of analysis tools needed to
   solve a specified system-level design problem. The FPG does not
   predispose a particular solution procedure; any relevant MDO solution
   architecture could be selected to implement the optimization. Finally,
   the solution architecture can be represented in a problem solution graph
   (PSG). The graph approach is applied to an example problem based on a
   commercial aircraft MDAO study.}},

Abstract = {{Emission reduction strategies are gaining attention as planning agencies
   work towards adherence to air quality conformity standards. Policymakers
   struggling to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) must grapple with a growing
   number of travel demand policies. To consider any of these emerging
   demand mechanisms as a viable option to meet emission targets, planners
   and policymakers need tools to better understand the implications of
   such policies on travel behavior. In this paper we present an integrated
   multimodal travel demand and emission model of four policy strategies;
   presenting GHG and air pollutant reduction results at a very detailed
   level. Multiple policy outcomes are compared within a single modeling
   framework and study area. The results reveal that while no one demand
   mechanism is likely to reduce emissions to a level that meets
   policy-maker's goals; a first-best pricing strategy that incorporates
   marginal social costs is the most effective emission reduction
   mechanism. Implementing such a mechanism may offer total emission
   reductions of up to 24 \%. However, the efficacy of this strategy must
   be weighed against difficulties of establishing efficient pricing, a
   costly implementation, and substantial negative impacts to non-highway
   facilities. Decision makers must select a mixture of pricing and land
   use strategies to achieve emission goals on all road facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the diversity of mercury (Hg)-methylating microbes in the

   Here, we developed novel degenerate PCR primers for a key Hg-methylating
   gene (hgcA) and amplified successfully the targeted genes from 48 paddy
   soil samples along an Hg concentration gradient in the Wanshan Hg mining
   area of China. A significant positive correlation was observed between
   hgcA gene abundance and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations, suggesting
   that microbes containing the genes contribute to Hg methylation in the
   sampled soils. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the
   hgcA gene diversity in microbial community structures from paddy soils
   was high and was influenced by the contents of total Hg, SO42-, NH4+,
   and organic matter. Phylogenetic analysis showed that hgcA microbes in
   the sampled soils likely were related to Deltaproteobacteria,
   Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, and two unclassified groups.
   This is a novel report of hgcA diversity in paddy habitats, and results
   here suggest a link between Hg-methylating microbes and MeHg
   contamination in situ, which would be useful for monitoring and

Abstract = {{Several studies have utilized ``leading points{''} concepts to explain
   the augmentation of burning rates in turbulent flames by flow
   fluctuations. These ideas have been particularly utilized to explain the
   strong sensitivity of turbulent burning rates to fuel composition.
   Leading point concepts suggest that the burning velocity is controlled
   by the velocity of the points on the flame that propagate farthest out
   into the reactants - thus, they de-emphasize the classical idea that
   burning velocity enhancement is due to increases in flame surface area.
   Rather, within this interpretation, flame area creation is the effect,
   not the cause, of augmented turbulent burning velocities. However, the
   theory behind the implementation of leading point concepts in turbulent
   combustion modeling needs further development and the definition of
   ``leading point{''} has not been fully clarified. For a certain class of
   steady shear flows, it is straightforward to demonstrate the leading
   point concept in an intuitive manner, but the problem becomes more
   complex when the leading points themselves evolve in time. In this
   paper, we use the G-equation to describe the flame dynamics and,
   utilizing results for Hamilton-Jacobi equations from the Aubry-Mather
   theory, demonstrate both the utility and limitations of leading points
   interpretations for front propagation, at least for deterministic
   problems. Specifically, we show how the large-time behavior of the
   solutions is controlled by discrete points on the flame under certain
   conditions and is, therefore, independent of the rest of the flow field
   details - a key hypothesis of leading points theories. However, it is
   possible to find other conditions where the large time behavior of the
   flame is not controlled by discrete points on the flame, but rather by
   the velocity field over its entire surface. Moreover, we also show that
   even in cases where the burning rate is controlled by discrete points,
   these points are not necessarily the most forward lying points in the
   flame front. Finally, we consider the case where the laminar flame speed
   is a function of flame front curvature and derive exact results for the
   sensitivity of the front speed to the Markstein length, l, for l > 0.

Abstract = {{Unlike visual stimuli, little attention has been paid to auditory
   stimuli in terms of emotion prediction with physiological signals. This
   paper aimed to investigate whether auditory stimuli can be used as an
   effective elicitor as visual stimuli for emotion prediction using
   physiological channels. For this purpose, a well-controlled experiment
   was designed, in which standardized visual and auditory stimuli were
   systematically selected and presented to participants to induce various
   emotions spontaneously in a laboratory setting. Numerous physiological
   signals, including facial electromyogram, electroencephalography, skin
   conductivity and respiration data, were recorded when participants were
   exposed to the stimulus presentation. Two data mining methods, namely
   decision rules and k-nearest neighbor based on the rough set technique,
   were applied to construct emotion prediction models based on the
   features extracted from the physiological data. Experimental results
   demonstrated that auditory stimuli were as effective as visual stimuli
   in eliciting emotions in terms of systematic physiological reactivity.
   This was evidenced by the best prediction accuracy quantified by the F-1
   measure (visual: 76.2\% vs. auditory: 76.1\%) among six emotion
   categories (excited, happy, neutral, sad, fearful and disgusted).
   Furthermore, we also constructed culture-specific (Chinese vs. Indian)
   prediction models. The results showed that model prediction accuracy was
   not significantly different between culture-specific models. Finally,
   the implications of affective auditory stimuli in human-computer
   interaction, limitations of the study and suggestions for further
   research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We report on morphological, optical, and lasing characteristics of InAs

   (having a bandgap energy corresponding to a wavelength of 1.35 mu m
   (1.35Q-InGaAsP)), which formed a dot-in-a-well (DWELL) structure. This
   DWELL was further sandwiched in In0.85Ga0.15As0.32P0.68 layers (1.15 mu
   m, 1.15Q-InGaAsP). A 2 monolayer-thick GaAs layer was simultaneously
   introduced right below the InAs QD layer in the DWELL structure
   (GDWELL). The emission wavelength of the InAs GDWELL was 1490 rim, which
   was slightly shorter than that of the InAs QDs embedded only in
   1.15Q-InGaAsP layers. To evaluate the effects of the GDWELL structure on
   lasing characteristics, gain-guided broad-area (BA) and index-guided
   ridge-waveguicle (RW) laser diodes (LDs) were fabricated. The BA-LDs
   with the InAs QDs embedded only in 1.15Q-InGaAsP layers did not show the
   lasing at room temperature (RT) even in pulsed mode. For the GDWELL
   structure, however, the lasing emissions from both the BA-LDs and RW-LDs
   were successfully achieved at RT in continuous-wave mode. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Laser surface tempering causes reduction in the surface hardness without
   affecting the bulk material hardness. The tempering behavior can be
   advantageous in advanced manufacturing processes that require controlled
   softening of the surface layers of through-hardened high-strength

   model for selecting the laser parameters that temper the surface layers
   of a through-hardened hyper-eutectoid steel (AISI 52100) over a known
   depth. First, a three-dimensional analytical thermal model is used to
   evaluate the temperature field produced in the material due to thermal
   cycles produced by laser scanning of the surface. The computed
   temperature histories are then fed to the phase-change model to predict
   the surface and subsurface hardness for the chosen laser-processing
   conditions. Microstructural analysis of the laser-treated AISI 52100
   workpiece surface is presented for different laser-processing
   conditions. It is shown that good agreement is achieved between the
   predicted and measured surface hardness.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium promoted molybdenum sulfide catalysts are well-known for the
   conversion of synthesis gas (H-2 and CO) to higher alcohols, primarily
   ethanol and propanol. Basic supports composed of mixed MgAl based oxides
   from decomposed hydrotalcites are known to yield enhanced higher alcohol
   selectivities compared to bulk or carbon supported molybdenum sulfide
   catalysts. In this study, the role of the metal oxide support and the
   active as well as precursor molybdenum phases on higher alcohol
   productivity and selectivity are probed. At fixed loadings of potassium
   (3 wt\%) and molybdenum (5 wt\%), supported molybdenum sulfide (MoS2)
   and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) catalysts are prepared on mixed MgAl
   oxide, alpha-alumina, and magnesium oxide supports and evaluated in
   higher alcohol synthesis. At low conversions, the catalytic results
   suggest that basic supports provide similar effects as the alkali
   promoter, helping to produce lower methanol (MeOH) selectivities and
   higher C2+OH selectivities while shifting overall selectivity from
   hydrocarbons towards alcohols. Under similar conditions, it is also
   shown that Mo2C compositions produce more hydrocarbons than MoS2
   catalysts, suggesting that higher potassium loadings are needed to fully
   eliminate acidity in molybdenum carbide phases. Conversion of the Mo2C
   phase to a MoS2 phase in situ, followed by catalytic testing in syngas
   hydrogenation shows that similar catalytic selectivities are obtained at
   similar CO conversions for catalysts with similar overall molybdenum and
   potassium loadings, regardless of the molybdenum phase in the
   precatalyst (MoO3 vs. Mo2C). The highest C2+ alcohol selectivities and
   productivities among the catalysts tested here are obtained on
   presulfided MoO3 catalysts on both alpha-alumina and magnesium oxide
   supports.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{In conventional hot embossing, a thermoplastic polymer undergoes phase
   transitions in liquid, semi-solid, and solid states through cyclic
   heating and cooling. This paper, in contrast, describes the development
   of a constant-temperature embossing process and compares its
   characteristics against standard hot embossing. The new process utilizes
   the crystallizing nature of supercooled polymer films to obtain the
   necessary phase transitions. By softening and crystallizing the
   supercooled polymer at the same temperature, the embossing and
   solidification stages can be carried out isothermally without a cooling
   step. PET, due to its relatively slow crystallizing kinetics, was chosen
   as a model material for this study. The embossed films with microgroove
   patterns of different sizes and aspect ratios were characterized for
   their replication fidelity and accuracy. For supercooled PET films,
   constant-temperature embossing with high replication quality and
   acceptable demolding characteristics was achieved in a large processing
   temperature window between T-g and T-m of PET. A parametric process
   study involving changes of the embossing temperature and embossing time
   was conducted, and the results indicated that the optimal process
   parameters for constant-temperature embossing can be derived from the

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is the life-limiting damage phenomenon
   occurring in gas turbine components. Laboratory TMF tests are
   traditionally used to simulate the operating conditions inside of the
   turbine. However, typical LCF laboratory TMF test conditions do not
   account for the superposition of a HCF waveform which occurs during
   operation. This work studies the effects of the superposition of a HCF
   waveform during a high temperature hold occurring in both in-phase and
   out-of-phase bithermal fatigue TMF tests performed on a single crystal
   Ni-base superalloy. Results indicate that an atypical inelastic
   deformation-environmental degradation interaction is caused by the
   modification of the waveform due primarily to the change in the mean
   strain during HCF loading. The effect on life was found to be severe
   under certain conditions. Analysis of the deformation response and the
   extent of environmental degradation, in the form of gamma' depletion,
   are presented. An existing physics-based life model (Amaro, R.L.,

Title = {{Removal of multiple electron acceptors by pilot-scale, two-stage

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{We studied the performance of a pilot-scale membrane biofilm reactor
   (MBfR) treating groundwater containing four electron acceptors: nitrate
   (NO3-), perchlorate (ClO4-), sulfate (SO42-), and oxygen (O-2). The
   treatment goal was to remove ClO4- from similar to 200 mu g/L to less
   than 6 mu g/L. The pilot system was operated as two MBfRs in series, and
   the positions of the lead and lag MBfRs were switched regularly. The
   lead MBfR removed at least 99\% of the O-2 and 63-88\% of NO3-,
   depending on loading conditions. The lag MBfR was where most of the
   ClO4- reduction occurred, and the effluent ClO4- concentration was
   driven to as low as 4 mu g/L, with most concentrations <= 10 mu g/L.
   However, SO42- reduction occurred in the lag MBfR when its NO3- + O-2
   flux was smaller than similar to 0.18 g H-2/m(2)-d, and this was
   accompanied by a lower ClO4- flux. We were able to suppress SO42-
   reduction by lowering the H-2 pressure and increasing the NO3- + O-2
   flux. We also monitored the microbial community using the quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction targeting characteristic reductase genes. Due
   to regular position switching, the lead and lag MBfRs had similar
   microbial communities. Denitrifying bacteria dominated the biofilm when
   the NO3- + O-2 fluxes were highest, but sulfate-reducing bacteria became
   more important when SO42- reduction was enhanced in the lag MBfR due to
   low NO3- + O-2 flux. The practical two-stage strategy to achieve
   complete ClO4- and NO3- reduction while suppressing SO42- reduction
   involved controlling the NO3- + O-2 surface loading between 0.18 and
   0.34 g H-2/m(2)-d and using a low H-2 pressure in the lag MBfR. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The main problem of percutaneous osseointegrated implants is poor
   skin-implant integration, which may cause infection. This study
   investigated the effects of pore size (Small, 40-100 mu m and Large,
   100-160 mu m), nanotubular surface treatment (Nano), and duration of
   implantation (3 and 6 weeks) on skin ingrowth into porous titanium. Each
   implant type was percutaneously inserted in the back of 35 rats randomly
   assigned to seven groups. Implant extrusion rate was measured weekly and
   skin ingrowth into implants was determined histologically after
   harvesting implants. It was found that all three types of implants
   demonstrated skin tissue ingrowth of over 30\% (at week 3) and 50\% (at
   weeks 4-6) of total implant porous area under the skin; longer
   implantation resulted in greater skin ingrowth (p < 0.05). Only one case
   of infection was observed (infection rate 2.9\%). Small and Nano groups
   showed the same implant extrusion rate which was lower than the Large
   group rate (0.06 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02 cm/week; p < 0.05). Ingrowth
   area was comparable in the Small, Large, and Nano implants. However,
   qualitatively, the Nano implants showed greatest cellular inhabitation
   within first 3 weeks. We concluded that percutaneous porous titanium
   implants allow for skin integration with the potential for a safe seal.

Abstract = {{The performance of neural electrodes implanted in the brain is often
   limited by host response in the surrounding brain tissue, including
   astrocytic scar formation, neuronal cell death, and inflammation around
   the implant. We applied conformal microgel coatings to silicon neural
   electrodes and examined host responses to microgel-coated and uncoated
   electrodes following implantation in the rat brain. In vitro analyses
   demonstrated significantly reduced astrocyte and microglia adhesion to
   microgel-coated electrodes compared to uncoated controls.
   Microgel-coated and uncoated electrodes were implanted in the rat brain
   cortex and the extent of activated microglia and astrocytes as well as
   neuron density around the implant were evaluated at 1, 4, and 24 weeks
   postimplantation. Microgel coatings reduced astrocytic recruitment
   around the implant at later time points. However, microglial response
   indicated persistence of inflammation in the area around the electrode.
   Neuronal density around the implanted electrodes was also lower for both
   implant groups compared to the uninjured control. These results
   demonstrate that microgel coatings do not significantly improve host
   responses to implanted neural electrodes and underscore the need for
   further improvements in implantable materials. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{Understanding the effect of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain on brain
   activity is important for clinical strategies. This is the first study,
   to our knowledge, to relate PHN pain to small-world properties of brain
   functional networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   used to construct functional brain networks of the subjects during the
   resting state. Sixteen patients with PHN pain and 16 (8 males, 8 females
   for both groups) age-matched controls were studied. The PHN patients
   exhibited decreased local efficiency along with non-significant changes
   of global efficiency in comparison with the healthy controls. Moreover,
   regional nodal efficiency was found to be significantly affected by PHN
   pain in the areas related to sense (postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal
   gyrus and thalamus), memory/affective processes (parahippocampal gyms)
   and emotional activities (putamen). Significant correlation (p <0.05)
   was also found between the nodal efficiency of putamen and pain
   intensity in PHN patients. Our results suggest that PHN modulates the
   local efficiency, and the small-world properties of brain networks may
   have potentials to objectively evaluate pain information in clinic. (C)

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional numerical model that computes hydrodynamics and
   morphodynamics is applied to the problem of calculating local scour
   around cylinders. A nested grid approach is implemented in the numerical
   scheme in order to decrease the overall computational demand but at the
   same time allow for high spatial resolution around the cylinder to
   increase numerical accuracy there. The computational grid consists of
   two structured blocks - a coarse block that discretises the entire
   domain and a fine block that only discretises the area around the
   cylinders. A novel interpolation technique accomplishes communication
   between the two blocks. Sediment transport in the morphodynamic model is
   calculated with a bed load transport formula combined with the sediment
   continuity equation to reproduce the unsteady scour hole development
   while the flow field is recalculated at each time step. Experimental
   data of flow and the local clear-water scour around single and multiple
   circular cylinders in a laboratory channel with a movable bed are
   obtained and compared with the results of the model. Flow, the maximum
   scour hole depth and the general scour hole geometry are reproduced well
   in all cases. The time evolution of the scouring is also captured
   reasonably well.}},

   Method Development and Implications for the Nitrogen Cycle}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Microbial activities in soils, such as (incomplete) denitrification,
   represent major sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas.
   The key enzyme for mitigating N2O emissions is NosZ, which catalyzes N2O
   reduction to N-2. We recently described ``atypical{''} functional NosZ
   proteins encoded by both denitrifiers and nondenitrifiers, which were
   missed in previous environmental surveys (R. A. Sanford et al., Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 109:19709-19714, 2012,
   doi:10.1073/pnas.1211238109). Here, we analyzed the abundance and
   diversity of both nosZ types in whole-genome shotgun metagenomes from
   sandy and silty loam agricultural soils that typify the U. S. Midwest
   corn belt. First, different search algorithms and parameters for
   detecting nosZ metagenomic reads were evaluated based on in
   silico-generated (mock) metagenomes. Using the derived cutoffs, 71
   distinct alleles (95\% amino acid identity level) encoding typical or
   atypical NosZ proteins were detected in both soil types. Remarkably,
   more than 70\% of the total nosZ reads in both soils were classified as
   atypical, emphasizing that prior surveys underestimated nosZ abundance.
   Approximately 15\% of the total nosZ reads were taxonomically related to
   Anaeromyxobacter, which was the most abundant genus encoding atypical
   NosZ-type proteins in both soil types. Further analyses revealed that
   atypical nosZ genes outnumbered typical nosZ genes in most publicly
   available soil metagenomes, underscoring their potential role in
   mediating N2O consumption in soils. Therefore, this study provides a
   bioinformatics strategy to reliably detect target genes in complex
   short-read metagenomes and suggests that the analysis of both typical
   and atypical nosZ sequences is required to understand and predict N2O
   flux in soils.
   IMPORTANCE Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with ozone
   layer destruction potential. Microbial activities control both the
   production and the consumption of N2O, i.e., its conversion to innocuous
   dinitrogen gas (N-2). Until recently, consumption of N2O was attributed
   to bacteria encoding ``typical{''} nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ).
   However, recent phylogenetic and physiological studies have shown that
   previously uncharacterized, functional, ``atypical{''} NosZ proteins are
   encoded in genomes of diverse bacterial groups. The present study
   revealed that atypical nosZ genes outnumbered their typical
   counterparts, highlighting their potential role in N2O consumption in
   soils and possibly other environments. These findings advance our
   understanding of the diversity of microbes and functional genes involved
   in the nitrogen cycle and provide the means (e. g., gene sequences) to
   study N2O fluxes to the atmosphere and associated climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Many conventional models that characterize the reliability of
   multi-component systems are developed on the premise that component
   failures in a system are independent. By contrast, this article offers a
   unique perspective on modeling component interdependencies and
   predicting their residual lifetimes. Specifically, the article provides
   a stochastic modeling framework for characterizing interactions among
   the degradation processes of interdependent components of a given
   system. This is achieved by modeling the behaviors of
   condition-/degradation-based sensor signals that are associated with
   each component. The proposed model is also used to estimate the residual
   lifetime distributions of each component. In addition, a Bayesian
   framework is used to update the predicted residual lifetime
   distributions using sensor signals that are correlated with the
   real-time dynamics associated with the interactions. The robustness and
   prediction accuracy of the methodology are investigated through a
   comprehensive simulation study that compares the performance of the
   proposed model to a counterpart benchmark that does not account for
   degradation interactions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a wireless power transfer (WPT) system for powering
   implantable biomedical devices; the system is configured to achieve high
   efficiency even with CMOS switches and printed-circuit-board pattern

   parallel-resonant transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) topology is
   advantageous for high efficiency even with lossy but compact components.
   In addition, the output voltage of the topology is insensitive to
   coupling and/or loading variations if the operating frequency is
   automatically adjusted according to coupling variations. A
   parallel-resonant class-D oscillator TX is developed to track the
   optimum operating frequency for the constant output voltage. The
   operating distance for the constant output voltage is also extended
   using a novel resonator structure, which contains two resonating coils.
   These proposed schemes allow a compact, efficient, and robust wireless
   power system. Maximum power of 174 mW can be transmitted with 63\%

Abstract = {{Sulfur odorant removal from pipeline natural gas can prevent or delay
   corrosion in gas turbines to increase their lifetime and efficiency.
   Removal of the odorant tert-butyl mercaptan (TBM) by selective
   adsorption with fiber sorbent modules and removal with pellet packed
   beds are compared in terms of capital and operating costs. Capital costs
   are estimated based on sizing the equipment items needed for each
   system, which varies depending on the regeneration gas used. Operating
   costs are estimated based on the utilities needed to run each system,
   again varying depending on the regeneration gas used, and also on
   whether heat integration is considered. Using a fraction of the product
   gas for regeneration is safer, simpler, and more economical than
   compressed air or nitrogen. Due to the need for more adsorber beds to
   process the same amount of TBM-containing pipeline natural gas, the
   capital cost associated with the pellet packed bed system is
   significantly higher than that of the fiber sorbent system. Heat
   integration with the sorption system by using the energy generated from
   waste gas combustion to produce steam dramatically decreases the
   operating cost by reducing the parasitic load. Overall, this process
   analysis shows that the fiber sorbent system with heat integration can
   be an attractive technology compared to packed bed systems for TBM
   removal.}},

   non-human primate behavioral experiments. As behavioral paradigms have
   become more complex, including unconstrained viewing of natural images,
   eye movements measured in these paradigms have become more variable and
   complex as well. Accordingly, the common practice of using acceleration,
   dispersion, or velocity thresholds to segment viewing behavior into
   periods of fixations and saccades may be insufficient.
   New method: Here we propose a novel algorithm, called Cluster Fix, which
   uses k-means cluster analysis to take advantage of the qualitative
   differences between fixations and saccades. The algorithm finds natural
   divisions in 4 state space parameters distance, velocity, acceleration,
   and angular velocity to separate scan paths into periods of fixations
   and saccades. The number and size of clusters adjusts to the variability
   of individual scan paths.
   Results: Cluster Fix can detect small saccades that were often
   indistinguishable from noisy fixations. Local analysis of fixations
   helped determine the transition times between fixations and saccades.
   Comparison with existing methods: Because Cluster Fix detects natural
   divisions in the data, predefined thresholds are not needed.
   Conclusions: A major advantage of Cluster Fix is the ability to
   precisely identify the beginning and end of saccades, which is essential
   for studying neural activity that is modulated by or time-locked to
   saccades. Our data suggest that Cluster Fix is more sensitive than
   threshold-based algorithms but comes at the cost of an increase in
   computational time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   sensors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Small magnetic fields are found to greatly enhance the reversible room
   temperature conductometric responses of n and p- type porous silicon
   (PS) interfaces, treated with nanostructured island sites containing
   paramagnetic Co(II) and Fe(II). At concentrations sufficiently low so as
   to avoid cross talk between the nanostructured island sites, the
   response to NO concentrations demonstrates the significant effect which
   the Co(II) and Fe(II) have on the decorated extrinsic semiconductor
   majority charge carriers as they direct a dominant electron transduction
   process for reversible electron transduction and chemical sensing
   (Inverse Hard and Soft acid/base principle) in the absence of
   significant chemical bond formation. Co(II) and Fe(II) oxide sites
   enhance response and provide a means for small magnetic fields to
   interact with and enhance the sensor interface response. For p-type
   systems, the interaction is with small virtually constant thermal
   electron populations lying above the Fermi energy at 0 K. The electron
   removal rate increases with magnetic field strength. At the highest
   magnetic fields and NO analyte concentrations the available electron
   population is depleted, and the response to the analyte decreases at
   higher concentrations. At lower magnetic fields (< 1000 G), the response
   faithfully follows concentration. For n-type systems, the magnetic field
   interaction increases resistance. This increase in response may be
   attributed to the interaction with donor levels similar to 0.025 eV
   below the conduction band. A substantial enhancement of sensor response
   relative to that for the Co(II) and Fe(II) treated PS interfaces is
   observed, with the introduction of a small magnetic field greatly
   increasing an already enhanced conductometric response. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{DAURE (Determination of the Sources of Atmospheric Aerosols in Urban and
   Rural Environments in the Western Mediterranean) was a multidisciplinary
   international field campaign aimed at investigating the sources and
   meteorological controls of particulate matter in the Western
   Mediterranean Basin (WMB). Measurements were simultaneously performed at
   an urban-coastal (Barcelona, BCN) and a rural-elevated (Montseny, MSY)
   site pair in NE Spain during winter and summer. State-of-the-art methods
   such as C-14 analysis, proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry, and
   high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry were applied for the first
   time in the WMB as part of DAURE. WMB regional pollution episodes were
   associated with high concentrations of inorganic and organic species
   formed during the transport to inland areas and built up at regional
   scales. Winter pollutants accumulation depended on the degree of
   regional stagnation of an air mass under anticyclonic conditions and the
   planetary boundary layer height. In summer, regional recirculation and
   biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation mainly determined
   the regional pollutant concentrations. The contribution from fossil
   sources to organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) and
   hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol concentrations were higher at BCN
   compared with MSY due to traffic emissions. The relative contribution of
   nonfossil OC was higher at MSY especially in summer due to biogenic
   emissions. The fossil OC/EC ratio at MSY was twice the corresponding
   ratio at BCN indicating that a substantial fraction of fossil OC was due
   to fossil SOA. In winter, BCN cooking emissions were identified as an
   important source of modern carbon in primary organic aerosol.}},

Abstract = {{An important component of probabilistic risk assessment methods is the
   development of models to quantify the direct consequences of damage to
   geo-structural components for a given intensity of the hazard. This
   paper presents a general probabilistic framework for correlated repair
   cost and downtime estimation of geo-structures exposed to seismic
   hazards. The framework uses as input the results of nonlinear
   time-history analysis of geo-structures for the set of earthquake
   records that are representative of the seismic hazard models for the
   region of interest. The repair cost and downtime are estimated for
   individual earthquakes probabilistically considering the uncertainties
   associated with damage states. In addition, the formulation of the
   repair cost and downtime accounts for the reduction in the repair
   requirements as the number of damaged components in the given damage
   state increases. An analytical linear and two bilinear regression models
   are proposed for conditional correlated seismic repair cost and downtime
   estimation of geo-structures given the intensity measure. The proposed
   framework is demonstrated by developing seismic repair models of a
   typical pile-supported wharf structure on the west coast of the United
   States. The presented framework is general and can be applied to other
   types of geo-structures and hazards and can include other decision
   variables such as loss of life as well. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Title = {{The use of polyimide-modified aluminum nitride fillers in AlN@PI/Epoxy
   composites with enhanced thermal conductivity for electronic
   encapsulation}},

Abstract = {{Polymer modified fillers in composites has attracted the attention of
   numerous researchers. These fillers are composed of core-shell
   structures that exhibit enhanced physical and chemical properties that
   are associated with shell surface control and encapsulated core
   materials. In this study, we have described an apt method to prepare
   polyimide (PI)-modified aluminum nitride (AlN) fillers, AlN@PI. These
   fillers are used for electronic encapsulation in high performance
   polymer composites. Compared with that of untreated AlN composite, these
   AlN@PI/epoxy composites exhibit better thermal and dielectric
   properties. At 40 wt\% of filler loading, the highest thermal
   conductivity of AlN@PI/epoxy composite reached 2.03 W/mK. In this way,
   the thermal conductivity is approximately enhanced by 10.6 times than
   that of the used epoxy matrix. The experimental results exhibiting the
   thermal conductivity of AlN@PI/epoxy composites were in good agreement
   with the values calculated from the parallel conduction model. This
   research work describes an effective pathway that modifies the surface
   of fillers with polymer coating. Furthermore, this novel technique
   improves the thermal and dielectric properties of fillers and these can
   be used extensively for electronic packaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Coulomb-excitation experiments to study electromagnetic properties of
   radioactive even-even Hg isotopes were performed with 2.85 MeV/nucleon
   mercury beams from REX-ISOLDE. Magnitudes and relative signs of the
   reduced E2 matrix elements that couple the ground state and low-lying
   excited states in Hg182-188 were extracted. Information on the
   deformation of the ground and the first excited 0(+) states was deduced
   using the quadrupole sum rules approach. Results show that the ground
   state is slightly deformed and of oblate nature, while a larger
   deformation for the excited 0(+) state was noted in Hg-182; 184. The
   results are compared to beyond mean field and interacting-boson based
   models and interpreted within a two-state mixing model. Partial
   agreement with the model calculations was obtained. The presence of two
   different structures in the light even-mass mercury isotopes that
   coexist at low excitation energy is firmly established.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrated the first study of piezotronic effect as a
   potential means for measuring temperature by utilizing ZnO nanowire (NW)
   film. The film was synthesized by the wet chemical deposition method and
   transferred to a flexible substrate using photoresist. The primary role
   of piezotronic effect over geometrical and piezoresistive effect in the
   as-fabricated devices has been confirmed, and piezotronic effect on
   charge carrier transportation under different strains is subsequently
   studied. In addition, we also presented that the temperature sensing
   capability of as-fabricated NW film based piezotronic devices can be
   tuned by piezopotential, which exhibits dramatically enhanced
   sensitivity. A theoretical model is proposed to interpret the observed
   behaviors of the sensor. This study provides an effective method to
   fabricate temperature sensors with higher performance based on
   piezotronic effect in the future.}},

   and half-wave plate to provide compensation. Based on this detection
   scheme, we design a basis-deviation compensation approach and test its
   feasibility in a voyage experiment. Unlike other polarization-correction

Abstract = {{Imaging Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (Imaging-DOAS) has
   been utilized in recent years to provide slant column density (SCD)
   distributions of several trace gas species in the plume. The present
   study introduces a new method using Imaging-DOAS data to determine
   two-dimensional plume structure from the plume emissions of power plant
   in conditions of negligible aerosol effects on radiative transfer within
   the plume. We demonstrates for the first time that two-dimensional
   distributions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in
   power plant emissions can be determined simultaneously in terms of SCD
   distribution. The SO2 SCD values generally decreased with increasing
   distance from the stack and with distance from the center of the plume.
   Meanwhile, high NO2 SCD was observed at locations several hundred meters
   away from the first stack due to the ratio change of NO to NO2 in NOx
   concentration, attributed to the NO oxidation by O-3. The results of
   this study show the capability of the Imaging-DOAS technique as a tool
   to estimate plume dimensions in power plant emissions.}},

Title = {{An intercomparison of three methods for the large-scale isolation of
   oceanic dissolved organic matter}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{14-19}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from large volumes of deep
   (674 m) and surface (21 m) ocean water via reverse
   osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) and two solid-phase extraction (SPE)
   methods (XAD-8/4 and PPL) at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii
   Authority (NELHA). By applying the three methods to common water
   samples, the efficiencies of XAD, PPL and RO/ED DOM isolation were
   compared. XAD recovered 42\% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from deep
   water (25\% with XAD-8; 17\% with XAD-4) and 30\% from surface water
   (16\% with XAD-8; 14\% with XAD-4). PPL recovered 61 +/- 3\% of DOC from
   deep water and 61\% from surface water. RO/ED recovered 82 +/- 3\% of
   DOC from deep water, 14 +/- 3\% of which was recovered in a sodium
   hydroxide rinse, and 75 +/- 5\% of DOC from surface water, with 12 +/-
   2\% in the sodium hydroxide rinse. The highest recoveries of all were
   achieved by the sequential isolation of DOC, first with PPL and then via
   RO/ED. This combined technique recovered 98\% of DOC from a deep water
   sample and 101\% of DOC from a surface water sample. In total, 1.9, 10.3
   and 1.6 g-C of DOC were collected via XAD. PPL and RO/ED, respectively.
   Rates of DOC recovery using the XAD, PPL and RO/ED methods were 10,33
   and 10 mg-C h(-1), respectively. Based upon C/N ratios, XAD isolates
   were heavily C-enriched compared with water column DOM, whereas RO/ED
   and PPL -> RO/ED isolate C/N values were most representative of the
   original DOM. All techniques are suitable for the isolation of large
   amounts of DOM with purities suitable for most advanced analytical
   techniques. Coupling PPL and RO/ED techniques may provide substantial
   progress in the search for a method to quantitatively isolate oceanic
   DOC, bringing the entirety of the DOM pool within the marine chemist's
   analytical window. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some real-world phenomena in geo-science, micro-economy, and turbulence,
   to name a few, can be effectively modeled by a fractional Brownian
   motion indexed by a Hurst parameter, a regularity level, and a scaling
   parameter sigma(2), an energy level. This article discusses estimation
   of a scaling parameter sigma(2) when a Hurst parameter is known. To
   estimate sigma(2), we propose three approaches based on maximum
   likelihood estimation, moment-matching, and concentration inequalities,
   respectively, and discuss the theoretical characteristics of the
   estimators and optimal-filtering guidelines. We also justify the
   improvement of the estimation of sigma(2) when a Hurst parameter is
   known. Using the three approaches and a parametric bootstrap methodology
   in a simulation study, we compare the confidence intervals of sigma(2)
   in terms of their lengths, coverage rates, and computational complexity
   and discuss empirical attributes of the tested approaches. We found that
   the approach based on maximum likelihood estimation was optimal in terms
   of efficiency and accuracy, but computationally expensive. The
   moment-matching approach was found to be not only comparably efficient
   and accurate but also computationally fast and robust to deviations from
   the fractional Brownian motion model.}},

Title = {{Shared Sanitation versus Individual Household Latrines: A Systematic
   Review of Health Outcomes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: More than 761 million people rely on shared sanitation
   facilities. These have historically been excluded from international
   sanitation targets, regardless of the service level, due to concerns
   about acceptability, hygiene and access. In connection with a proposed
   change in such policy, we undertook this review to identify and
   summarize existing evidence that compares health outcomes associated
   with shared sanitation versus individual household latrines.
   Methods and Findings: Shared sanitation included any type of facilities
   intended for the containment of human faeces and used by more than one
   household, but excluded public facilities. Health outcomes included
   diarrhoea, helminth infections, enteric fevers, other faecal-oral
   diseases, trachoma and adverse maternal or birth outcomes. Studies were
   included regardless of design, location, language or publication status.
   Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the STROBE
   guidelines. Twenty-two studies conducted in 21 countries met the
   inclusion criteria. Studies show a pattern of increased risk of adverse
   health outcomes associated with shared sanitation compared to individual
   household latrines. A meta-analysis of 12 studies reporting on diarrhoea
   found increased odds of disease associated with reliance on shared
   sanitation (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95\% CI: 1.18-1.76).
   Conclusion: Evidence to date does not support a change of existing
   policy of excluding shared sanitation from the definition of improved
   sanitation used in international monitoring and targets. However, such
   evidence is limited, does not adequately address likely confounding, and
   does not identify potentially important distinctions among types of
   shared facilities. As reliance on shared sanitation is increasing,
   further research is necessary to determine the circumstances, if any,
   under which shared sanitation can offer a safe, appropriate and
   acceptable alternative to individual household latrines.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Partial differential equations (PDEs) pose a challenge for control
   engineers, both in terms of theory and computational requirements. PDEs
   are usually approximated by ordinary differential equations or
   difference equations via the finite difference method, resulting in a
   high-dimensional state-space system. The obtained system matrix is
   oftentimes symmetric, which allows this high-dimensional system to be
   decomposed into a set of single-dimensional systems using its singular
   value decomposition. Any linear constraints in the original problem can
   also be simplified by replacing it with an ellipsoidal constraint. Based
   on this, speedup of the moving horizon estimation is achieved by
   employing an analytical solution obtained by augmenting the ellipsoidal
   constraint into the objective function as a penalty weighted by a
   decreasing scaling parameter. The approximated penalty method algorithm
   allows for efficient parallel computation for sub-problems. The proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated for a two-dimensional diffusion problem where
   the concentration field is estimated using distributed sensors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of monodisperse core/shell 5/1.5 nm Au/CuPt
   nanoparticles by coreduction of platinum acetylacetonate and copper
   acetylacetonate in the presence of 5 nm Au nanoparticles. The CuPt alloy
   effect and core/shell interactions make these Au/CuPt nanoparticles a
   promising catalyst for both oxygen reduction reaction and methanol
   oxidation reaction in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. Their specific (mass)
   reduction and oxidation activities reach 2.72 mA/cm(2) (1500 mA/mg (pt))
   at 0.9 V and 0.755 mA/cm(2) (441 mA/mg (pt)) at 0.8 V (vs reversible
   hydrogen electrode), respectively. Our studies show that the existence
   of the Au nanoparticle core not only minimizes the Pt usage but also
   improves the stability of the Au/CuPt catalyst for fuel cell reactions.
   The results suggest that the core/shell design is indeed effective for
   optimizing nanoparticle catalysis. The same concept may be extended to
   other multimetallic nanoparticle systems, making it possible to tune
   nanoparticle catalysis for many different chemical reactions.}},

   high lithiation-delithiation rate in Ge. In this Concept, we review
   recent progress in the in situ electrochemical study of the lithiation
   and delithiation mechanisms in Ge nanowires and nanoparticles. Insights
   into the nanostructural evolution and mechanical degradation during
   electrochemical reactions are highlighted. Critical unresolved questions

Abstract = {{Loss or attenuated expression of the tumor-suppressor gene FHIT is
   associated paradoxically with poor progression of human tumors. Fhit
   promotes apoptosis and regulates reactive oxygen species; however, the
   mechanism by which Fhit inhibits tumor growth in animals remains
   unclear. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary approach based on
   bioinformatics, small RNA library screening, human tissue analysis, and
   a xenograft mouse model to identify a novel member of the miR-548 family
   in the fourth intron of the human FHIT gene. Characterization of this
   human-specific microRNA illustrates the importance of this class of
   microRNAs in tumor suppression and may influence interpretation of Fhit

Abstract = {{All-cellulose nanocomposite films were prepared using native cellulose
   nanofibrils (CNFs) as fillers and lithium chloride/N,N-dimethylacetamide
   (LiCl/DMAc) dissolved regenerated cellulose as the matrix. The CNFs,

   The morphology, structure, and properties of the nanocomposite films
   were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), optical transmittance, thermal gravimetric analysis

   mechanical properties compared to the regenerated cellulose matrix. By
   varying the CNFs content, the tensile strength of the nanocomposite
   films increased from 61.56 MPa to 99.92 MPa and the Young's modulus
   increased from 0.76 GPa to 4.16 GPa. This work provided a promising

Title = {{Thermochemical behavior of nano-sized aluminum-coated nickel particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the
   thermochemical behavior of aluminum-coated nickel particles in the size
   range of 4-13 nm, beyond which asymptotic behavior is observed. The
   atomic interactions are captured using an embedded atom model. Emphasis
   is placed on the particle melting behavior, diffusion characteristics,
   and inter-metallic reactions. Results are compared with the
   corresponding properties of nickel-coated nano-aluminum particles.
   Melting of the shell, which is a heterogeneous process beginning at the
   outer surface of the particle, is followed by diffusion of aluminum and
   nickel atoms and inter-metallic reactions. The ensuing chemical energy
   heats up the particle under adiabatic conditions. The alloying reactions
   progressively transform the core-shell structured particle into a
   homogeneous alloy. The melting temperature of the shell is weakly
   dependent on the core size, but increases significantly with increasing
   shell thickness, from 750 K at 1 nm to 1,000 K at 3 nm. The core melts
   at a temperature comparable to the melting point of a nascent particle,
   contrary to the phenomenon of superheating observed for nickel-coated
   aluminum particles. The melting temperature of the core decreases from
   1,730 to 1,500 K, when its diameter decreases from 10 to 7 nm. For
   smaller cores, the majority of nickel atoms participate in reactions
   before melting. The diffusion coefficient of nickel atoms in aluminum
   shell exhibits a temperature dependence of the form D = D (0) exp(-E
   (A)/RT), with an activation energy of 43.65 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential
   factor of 1.77 x 10(-7) m(2)/s. The adiabatic reaction temperature, also
   a size-dependent quantity, increases with increasing core diameter,
   attains a maximum value of 2,050 K at 5 nm, and decreases with further
   increase in the core diameter. The calculated values agree reasonably
   with those obtained via chemical equilibrium analysis. The burning time
   exhibits strong dependence of particle core size and shell thickness of
   the form tau (b) = a d (c) (n) delta (s) (m) , where the exponents n and
   m are 1.70 and 1.38, respectively. The finding further corroborates the
   fact that the reaction rate is controlled by diffusion process.}},

Abstract = {{TCR-pMHC interactions initiate adaptive immune responses, but the
   mechanism of how such interactions under force induce T cell signaling
   is unclear. We show that force prolongs lifetimes of single TCR-pMHC
   bonds for agonists (catch bonds) but shortens those for antagonists
   (slip bonds). Both magnitude and duration of force are important, as the
   highest Ca2+ responses were induced by 10 pN via both pMHC catch bonds
   whose lifetime peaks at this force and anti-TCR slip bonds whose maximum
   lifetime occurs at 0 pN. High Ca2+ levels require early and rapid
   accumulation of bond lifetimes, whereas short-lived bonds that slow
   early accumulation of lifetimes correspond to low Ca2+ responses. Our
   data support a model in which force on the TCR induces signaling events
   depending on its magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing, such that
   agonists form catch bonds that trigger the T cell digitally, whereas
   antagonists form slip bonds that fail to activate.}},

   integrated into DSSCs, and the quadrupolar structure is an operational
   design, as the IPCE reached up to 38\% from 400 nm to 600 nm. The
   lengthening of the donor chain increases the efficiency, demonstrating
   the appeal of these oligomeric dyes for DSSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to prepare, characterize, and
   evaluate two new composite photocatalysts: t-LaVO4/g-C3N4 and
   m-LaVO4/g-C3N4. The two catalysts were synthesized with m-LaVO4 or
   t-LaVO4 and g-C3N4, and characterized by various techniques including
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet
   visible-light (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and
   photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The structure characterizations
   indicate that the two composites have similar phase composition. Both of
   them consist of LaVO4 and g-C3N4. Meanwhile, their photoabsorption
   performance is also similar. The photocatalytic test indicates that both
   m-LaVO4 and t-LaVO4 can effectively promote the photoactivity of g-C3N4,
   as demonstrated with the PL and photocurrent time experiments, although
   the optimal concentrations of LaVO4 in the two catalysts are different.
   Both LaVO4/g-C3N4 and t-LaVO4/g-C3N4 are promising photocatalysts for
   degradation of RhB.}},

Abstract = {{The search for the next generation of highly ion-conducting polymer
   electrolyte membranes has been a subject of intense research because of
   their potential applications in energy storage and transformation
   devices, such as fuel cells, vanadium flow batteries, membrane-based
   artificial photosynthesis, water electrolysis, or water treatment
   processes such as electrodialysis desalination. Nanochannels that
   contain ionic groups, through which ``hydrated{''} ions can pass, are
   believed to be of key importance for efficient ion transport in polymer
   electrolytes membranes. In this Perspective, we present an overview of
   the approaches to induce ion-conducting nanochannel formation by
   self-assembly, using polymer architecture such as block or comb-shaped
   copolymers. The transport properties of ion-containing aromatic
   copolymers are examined to obtain an insight into the fundamental
   behavior of these materials, which are targeted toward applications in
   fuel cells and other electrochemical devices. Challenges in obtaining
   well-defined nanochannel morphologies, and possible strategies to
   improve transport properties in aromatic copolymers having structures
   with the potential to withstand operation in electrochemical/chemical
   devices, are discussed. Opportunities for the application of
   ion-containing aromatic copolymer membranes in fuel cells, vanadium flow
   batteries, membrane-based artificial photosynthesis, electrolysis, and
   electrodialysis are also reviewed. Research needs for further
   improvements in ionic conductivity and durability, and their
   applications are identified.}},

Abstract = {{Among g-conjugated polymer donors for efficient bulk-heterojunction
   (BHJ) solar cell applications,
   poly(benzo{[}1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-thieno{[}3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)
   (PBDTTPD) polymers yield some of the highest open-circuit voltages
   (V-OC, ca. 0.9 V) and fill-factors (FF, ca. 70\%) in conventional
   (single-cell) BHJ devices with PCBM acceptors. In PBDTTPD, side chains
   of varying size and branching affect polymer self-assembly,
   nanostructural order, and impact material performance. However, the role
   of the polymer side-chain pattern in the intimate mixing between polymer
   donors and PCBM acceptors, and on the development of the BHJ morphology
   is in general less understood. In this contribution, we show that ring
   substituents such as furan (F), thiophene (T) and selenophene
   (S)-incorporated into the side chains of PBDTTPD polymers-can induce
   significant and, of importance, very different morphological effects in
   BHJs with PCBM. A combination of experimental and theoretical (via
   density functional theory) characterizations sheds light on how varying
   the heteroatom of the ring substituents impacts (i) the preferred
   side-chain configurations and (ii) the ionization, electronic, and
   optical properties of the PBDTTPD polymers. In parallel, we find that
   the PBDT(X)TPD analogs (with X = F, T, or S) span a broad range of power
   conversion efficiencies (PCEs, 3-6.5\%) in optimized devices with
   improved thin-film morphologies via the use of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),
   and discuss that persistent morphological impediments at the nanoscale
   can be at the origin of the spread in PCE across optimized
   PBDT(X)TPD-based devices. With their high V-OC similar to 1 V,
   PBDT(X)TPD polymers are promising candidates for use in the high-band
   gap cell of tandem solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the short-term planktonic microbial community
   structure and resilience in Lake Lanier (GA, USA) while simultaneously
   evaluating the technical aspects of identifying taxa via 16S rRNA gene
   amplicon and metagenomic sequence data. 16S rRNA gene amplicons
   generated from four temporally discrete samples were sequenced with 454
   GS-FLX-Ti yielding similar to 40,000 rRNA gene sequences from each
   sample and representing similar to 300 observed OTUs. Replicates
   obtained from the same biological sample clustered together but several
   biases were observed, linked to either the PCR or sequencing-preparation
   steps. In comparisons with companion whole-community shotgun metagenome
   datasets, the estimated number of OTUs at each timepoint was concordant,
   but 1.5 times and similar to 10 times as many phyla and genera,
   respectively, were identified in the metagenomes. Our analyses showed
   that the 16S rRNA gene captures broad shifts in community diversity over
   time, but with limited resolution and lower sensitivity compared to
   metagenomic data. We also identified OTUs that showed marked shifts in
   abundance over four close timepoints separated by perturbations and
   tracked these taxa in the metagenome vs. 16S rRNA amplicon data. A
   strong summer storm had less of an effect on community composition than
   did seasonal mixing, which revealed a distinct succession of organisms.
   This study provides insights into freshwater microbial communities and
   advances the approaches for assessing community diversity and dynamics
   in situ.}},

Title = {{Accelerated barrier optimization compressed sensing (ABOCS) for CT
   reconstruction with improved convergence}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed a new algorithm of accelerated barrier
   optimization compressed sensing (ABOCS) for iterative CT reconstruction.
   The previous implementation of ABOCS uses gradient projection (GP) with
   a BarzilaiBorwein (BB) step-size selection scheme (GP-BB) to search for
   the optimal solution. The algorithm does not converge stably due to its
   non-monotonic behavior. In this paper, we further improve the
   convergence of ABOCS using the unknown-parameter Nesterov (UPN) method
   and investigate the ABOCS reconstruction performance on clinical patient
   data. Comparison studies are carried out on reconstructions of computer
   simulation, a physical phantom and a head-and-neck patient. In all of
   these studies, the ABOCS results using UPN show more stable and faster
   convergence than those of the GP-BB method and a state-of-the-art
   Bregman-type method. As shown in the simulation study of the Shepp-Logan
   phantom, UPN achieves the same image quality as those of GP-BB and the
   Bregman-type methods, but reduces the iteration numbers by up to 50\%
   and 90\%, respectively. In the Catphan(C)600 phantom study, a
   high-quality image with relative reconstruction error (RRE) less than
   3\% compared to the full-view result is obtained using UPN with 17\%
   projections (60 views). In the conventional filtered-backprojection
   reconstruction, the corresponding RRE is more than 15\% on the same
   projection data. The superior performance of ABOCS with the UPN
   implementation is further demonstrated on the head-and-neck patient.
   Using 25\% projections (91 views), the proposed method reduces the RRE
   from 21\% as in the filtered backprojection (FBP) results to 7.3\%. In
   conclusion, we propose UPN for ABOCS implementation. As compared to
   GP-BB and the Bregman-type methods, the new method significantly
   improves the convergence with higher stability and fewer iterations.}},

Title = {{Agave proves to be a low recalcitrant lignocellulosic feedstock for
   biofuels production on semi-arid lands}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Agave, which is well known for tequila and other liquor
   production in Mexico, has recently gained attention because of its
   attractive potential to launch sustainable bioenergy feedstock solutions
   for semi-arid and arid lands. It was previously found that agave cell
   walls contain low lignin and relatively diverse non-cellulosic
   polysaccharides, suggesting unique recalcitrant features when compared
   to conventional C-4 and C-3 plants.
   Results: Here, we report sugar release data from fungal enzymatic
   hydrolysis of non-pretreated and hydrothermally pretreated biomass that
   shows agave to be much less recalcitrant to deconstruction than poplar
   or switchgrass. In fact, non-pretreated agave has a sugar release five
   to eight times greater than that of poplar wood and switchgrass.
   Meanwhile, state of the art techniques including glycome profiling,
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Simon's Stain, confocal laser scanning
   microscopy and so forth, were applied to measure interactions of
   non-cellulosic wall components, cell wall hydrophilicity, and enzyme
   accessibility to identify key structural features that make agave cell
   walls less resistant to biological deconstruction when compared to
   poplar and switchgrass.
   Conclusions: This study systematically evaluated the recalcitrant
   features of agave plants towards biofuels applications. The results show
   that not only does agave present great promise for feeding biorefineries
   on semi-arid and arid lands, but also show the value of studying agave's
   low recalcitrance for developments in improving cellulosic energy crops.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a triboelectric generator (TEG) has been invented to convert
   mechanical energy into electricity by a conjunction of
   triboelectrification and electrostatic induction. Compared to the
   traditional electromagnetic generator (EMG) that produces a high output
   current but low voltage, the TEG has different output characteristics of
   low output current but high output voltage. In this paper, we present a
   comparative study regarding the fundamentals of TEGs and EMGs. The power
   output performances of the EMG and the TEG have a special complementary
   relationship, with the EMG being a voltage source and the TEG a current
   source. Utilizing a power transformed and managed (PTM) system, the
   current output of a TEG can reach as high as similar to 3 mA, which can
   be coupled with the output signal of an EMG to enhance the output power.
   We also demonstrate a design to integrate a TEG and an EMG into a single
   device for simultaneously harvesting mechanical energy. In addition, the
   integrated NGs can independently output a high voltage and a high
   current to meet special needs.}},

Title = {{Force and flow at the onset of drag in plowed granular media}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{We study the transient drag force FD on a localized intruder in a
   granular medium composed of spherical glass particles. A flat plate is
   translated horizontally from rest through the granular medium to observe
   how FD varies as a function of the medium's initial volume fraction,
   phi. The force response of the granular material differs above and below
   the granular critical state, fc, the volume fraction which corresponds
   to the onset of grain dilatancy. For phi < phi(c) F-D increases
   monotonically with displacement and is independent of drag velocity for
   the range of velocities examined (< 10 cm/s). For phi > phi(c), F-D
   rapidly rises to a maximum and then decreases over further displacement.
   The maximum force for phi > phi(c) increases with increasing drag
   velocity. In quasi-two-dimensional drag experiments, we use granular
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure time resolved strain fields
   associated with the horizontal motion of a plate started from rest. PIV
   experiments show that the maxima in F-D for phi > phi(c) are associated
   with maxima in the spatially averaged shear strain field. For phi >
   phi(c) the shear strain occurs in a narrow region in front of the plate,
   a shear band. For phi < phi(c) the shear strain is not localized, the
   shear band fluctuates in space and time, and the average shear increases
   monotonically with displacement. Laser speckle measurements made at the
   granular surface ahead of the plate reveal that for phi < phi(c)
   particles are in motion far from the intruder and shearing region. For
   phi > phi(c), surface particles move only during the formation of the
   shear band, coincident with the maxima in F-D, after which the particles
   remain immobile until the sheared region reaches the measurement region.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this report is to describe the outcome of
   sequential particulated cartilage allograft and autologous osteochondral
   transfer treatments for an osteochondral lesion of the medial femoral
   condyle. Methods: A 44-year-old woman was treated with a particulated
   juvenile articular cartilage allograft (DeNovo NT) for a chondral lesion
   of the knee. As a result of continued pain, she had 2 further surgeries,
   including an autologous osteochondral transfer system procedure and
   finally a unicondylar knee arthroplasty. At the final procedure, the
   areas of the allograft and autograft tissue were biopsied for
   histological evaluation. The quality of the residual cartilage tissue
   was assessed first by equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast
   agent via micro-computed tomography (EPIC-mu CT), and then by
   hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin O staining, and polarized light
   microscopy. Results: Despite showing good healing at 7 months
   postsurgery by MRI, at 28 months post DeNovo NT tissue implantation the
   excised cartilage tissue was heterogeneous, with some regions of
   hyaline-like cartilage and some regions of fibrocartilage. The later
   mosaicplasty may have helped maintain hyaline-like cartilage of the
   DeNovo NT tissue in its vicinity. Conclusion: This case report describes
   the cartilage repair tissue produced by DeNovo NT implantation and
   compares it with autologous osteochondral plug tissue.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper acoustic wave reflection and transmission are studied at
   the interface between a phononic crystal (PC) and a homogeneous medium
   using a Bloch wave expansion technique. A finite element analysis of the
   PC yields the requisite dispersion relationships and a complete set of
   Bloch waves, which in turn are employed to expand the transmitted
   pressure field. A solution for the reflected and transmitted wave fields
   is then obtained using continuity conditions at the half-space
   interface. The method introduces a group velocity criterion for Bloch
   wave selection, which when not enforced, is shown to yield non-physical
   results. Following development, the approach is applied to example PCs
   and results are compared to detailed numerical solutions, yielding very
   good agreement. The approach is also employed to uncover bands of
   incidence angles whereby perfect acoustic reflection from the PC occurs,
   even for frequencies outside of stop bands. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society

   Nanogenerator}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Vibrations in living environments are generally distributed over a wide
   frequency spectrum and exhibit multiple motion directions over time,
   which renders most of the current vibration energy harvesters
   unpractical for their harvesting purposes. Here, a 3D triboelectric
   nanogenerator (3D-TENG) is designed based on the coupling of the
   triboelectrification effect and the electrostatic induction effect. The
   3D-TENG operates in a hybridization mode of conjuntioning the vertical
   contact-separation mode and the in-plane sliding mode. The innovative
   design facilitates harvesting random vibrational energy in multiple
   directions over a wide bandwidth. An analytical model is established to
   investigate the mechano-triboelectric transduction of 3D-TENG and the
   results agree well with experimental data. The 3D-TENG is able to
   harvest ambient vibrations with an extremely wide working bandwidth.
   Maximum power densities of 1.35 W m(-2) and 1.45 W m(-2) are achieved
   under out-of-plane and in-plane excitation, respectively. The 3D TENG is
   designed for harvesting ambient vibration energy, especially at low
   frequencies, under a range of conditions in daily life and has potential
   applications in environmental/infrastructure monitoring and charging
   portable electronics.}},

Title = {{Morphological Factors Involved in Adhesion of Acid-Cleaned Diatom Silica}},
Journal = {{SILICON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-107}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Diatoms, unicellular microalgae with silica cell walls, have
   strong adhesive properties, which are dominated by chemical interactions
   between secreted organic material and the substrate. Possible
   technological applications of diatoms are likely to involve the adhesion
   of silica particles, or derivatives, which have been cleaned of organic
   material. Because the morphologies of diatom cell walls are far more
   complex than defined model structures, the relationship between
   morphology and adhesion for such materials is unknown.
   Methods In this paper we develop a new approach to monitor the adhesion
   of acid-cleaned diatom silica using parallelplate flow chambers. We have
   evaluated factors such as settling time, extent of dryness, and
   substrate properties, and compared diatom species with silica features
   differing in size, shape, and percentage of surface contact area.
   Results Results indicated better adhesion of particles with higher
   surface contact area below a threshold of overall size, and a
   contribution by the number of possible contact surfaces to initial
   adhesion. We identified two stages in adhesion response to increasing
   shear stress. In the first stage, at low shear stress, species-dependent
   morphology played a major role in determining the strength of adhesion.
   After loosely adhered particles were removed at low shear, a second
   stage of persistent adhesion emerged at higher shear stresses. In the
   second stage, variations in morphology had a much smaller effect on
   adhesion.
   Conclusions These results identify conditions and fundamental
   morphological features for adhesion that can be utilized in future
   technological applications of silica particles with complex shapes.}},

Abstract = {{The absorber has the largest impact on the performance of an absorption
   heat pump. Most models of absorption heat and mass transfer in
   horizontal tube banks make simplistic assumptions about flow mechanisms.
   The flow over tube banks actually occurs as wavy films on the tube
   surface and as droplets in the inter-tube space. The formation and
   detachment of these droplets, and their impact on the tube affects heat
   and mass transfer considerably. Absorption models in the literature
   typically assume the solution to flow as a uniform film. The present
   study models heat and mass transfer in the absorber while accounting for
   the realistic drop-wise and wavy film flow patterns. The significant
   effects of mixing and the waves caused by droplet impact on heat and
   mass transfer are successfully modeled with full 3-D spatial and
   temporal resolution using the Volume of Fluid technique. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Heat transfer and pressure drop for two-phase flow inside tubes are
   closely related to the corresponding flow mechanisms. The flow patterns

   flow regime transition criteria are proposed. The data are used to
   understand the physical mechanisms and the governing influences for each
   of the identified flow regimes and develop dimensionless transition
   criteria. These criteria can be utilized to identify the flow regimes
   and transitions for various fluids, operating conditions and channel
   sizes, thereby generalizing their applicability. This mechanistic
   determination of condensation flow regimes in different operating

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymer scaffolds can be used to deliver soluble factors
   to enhance osseous remodeling in bone defects. To this end, we designed
   a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLAGA) microsphere scaffold to sustain
   the release of FTY720, a selective agonist for sphingosine 1-phosphate
   (S1P) receptors. The microsphere scaffolds were created from fast
   degrading 50:50 PLAGA and/or from slow-degrading 85:15 PLAGA. Temporal
   and spatial regulation of bone remodeling depended on the use of
   appropriate scaffolds for drug delivery. The release profiles from the
   scaffolds were used to design an optimal delivery system to treat
   critical size cranial defects in a rodent model. The ability of local
   FTY720 delivery to maximize bone regeneration was evaluated with
   micro-computed tomography (microCT) and histology. Following 4 weeks of
   defect healing, FTY720 delivery from 85:15 PLAGA scaffolds resulted in a
   significant increase in bone volumes in the defect region compared to
   the controls. A 85:15 microsphere scaffolds maintain their structural
   integrity over a longer period of time, and cause an initial burst
   release of FTY720 due to surface localization of the drug. This
   encourages cellular in-growth and an increase in new bone formation. (c)

   sequences}},

Abstract = {{Determining the taxonomic affiliation of sequences assembled from
   metagenomes remains a major bottleneck that affects research across the
   fields of environmental, clinical and evolutionary microbiology. Here,
   we introduce MyTaxa, a homology-based bioinformatics framework to
   classify metagenomic and genomic sequences with unprecedented accuracy.
   The distinguishing aspect of MyTaxa is that it employs all genes present
   in an unknown sequence as classifiers, weighting each gene based on its
   (predetermined) classifying power at a given taxonomic level and
   frequency of horizontal gene transfer. MyTaxa also implements a novel
   classification scheme based on the genome-aggregate average amino acid
   identity concept to determine the degree of novelty of sequences
   representing uncharacterized taxa, i.e. whether they represent novel
   species, genera or phyla. Application of MyTaxa on in silico generated
   (mock) and real metagenomes of varied read length (100-2000 bp) revealed
   that it correctly classified at least 5\% more sequences than any other
   tool. The analysis also showed that similar to 10\% of the assembled
   sequences from human gut metagenomes represent novel species with no
   sequenced representatives, several of which were highly abundant in situ
   such as members of the Prevotella genus. Thus, MyTaxa can find several
   important applications in microbial identification and diversity
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{The structural organization of three different families of

   significant interest for their remarkable charge-transport properties.
   By performing molecular mechanics/dynamics simulations with carefully
   re-parameterized force fields, it is illustrated in particular how the
   supramolecular organization of these conjugated polymers is driven by an
   interplay between the length and nature of the conjugated monomer unit
   and the packing of their alkyl side chains, and to what extent it
   impacts the charge-carrier mobility, as monitored by quantum-chemical
   calculations of the intermolecular hopping transfer integrals. This
   Progress Report is concluded by providing generic guidelines for the
   design of materials with enhanced degrees of supramolecular
   organization.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the role of etching in the formation of Ag nanoplates
   with different morphologies. By examining the reduction of AgNO3 with
   poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) in an aqueous solution under a hydrothermal
   condition, we confirm that etching plays an essential role in promoting
   the growth of Ag triangular nanoplates with straight edges at the
   expense of multiple twinned particles via Ostwald ripening. Once all the
   multiple twinned particles are gone, etching will continue at the
   corners of nanoplates, leading to the formation of enneahedral
   nanoplates with curved edges. When the nanoplates with straight edges
   are transferred into ethanol and subjected to a solvothermal treatment,
   we obtain nanoplates with wavy edges and sharp corners due to etching on
   the edges. A comparison study indicates that, at the same particle
   concentration, Ag nanoplates with wavy edges embraces a SERS enhancement
   factor at least 6 and 13 times stronger than those with straight and
   curved edges, respectively. The results from finite difference time
   domain calculations support our experimental observation that the sharp
   features on nanoplates with wavy edges are the most active sites for
   SERS.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{213-228}},

Abstract = {{To meet the testing requirements of high speed components used in modern
   communication systems, in an efficient and cost effective manner, it is
   necessary to develop new device performance measurement techniques that
   are easily scalable to high frequencies. Traditional up/down conversion
   based transmitter testing architectures are sensitive to the linearity
   of the mixers and carrier phase noise in the receiver. Direct
   undersampling based test instrumentation can overcome the limitations
   imposed by mixers in up/down conversion. A major challenge in direct
   undersampling based test architecture is to achieve precise phase
   alignment between different components of the test setup. Such phase
   alignment of high frequency signals requires the use of expensive test
   instruments adding to the cost and complexity of the overall test
   system. To resolve this problem, an incoherent undersampling based test
   method is developed in this research that eliminates the need for
   precise phase synchronization between the RF test signal carrier, its
   amplitude-modulated envelope (generally necessary for measuring
   amplifier nonlinearity) and the reference sampling clock. A
   side-benefit, due to the use of signal undersampling, is that signal
   acquisition is achieved without the use of a Nyquist rate data
   converter. Multiple RF performance metrics are extracted without the use
   of a reference receiver. The accuracy of the proposed setup is compared
   against existing coherent sampling based test setups.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor nanowire kinking superstructures, particularly those with
   long-range structural coherence, remain difficult to fabricate. Here, we
   combine high-resolution electron microscopy with operand infrared
   spectroscopy to show why this is the case for Si nanowires and, in doing
   so, reveal the interplay between defect propagation and surface
   chemistry during < 211 > -> < 111 > and < 211 > -> < 211 > kinking. Our
   experiments show that adsorbed hydrogen atoms are responsible for
   selecting < 211 >-oriented growth and indicate that a twin boundary
   imparts structural coherence. The twin boundary, only continuous at <
   211 > -> < 211 > kinks, reduces the symmetry of the trijunction and
   limits the number of degenerate directions available to the nanowire.
   These findings constitute a general approach for rationally engineering
   kinking superstructures and also provide important insight into the role

Abstract = {{Reciprocating motion is a widely existing form of mechanical motion in
   natural environment. In this work we reported a case-encapsulated
   triboelectric nanogenerator (cTENG) based on sliding electrification to
   convert reciprocating motion into electric energy. Patterned with
   multiple sets of grating electrodes and lubricated with
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles, the cTENG exported an
   average effective output power of 12.2 mW over 140 k Omega external load
   at a sliding velocity of 1 m/s, in corresponding to a power density of
   1.36 W/m(2). The sliding motion can be induced by direct-applied forces
   as well as inertia forces, enabling the applicability of the cTENG in
   addressing ambient vibration motions that feature large amplitude and
   low frequency. The cTENG was demonstrated to effectively harvest energy
   from human body motions and wavy water surface, indicating promising
   prospects of the cTENG in applications such as portable and stand-alone
   self-powered electronics.}},

Abstract = {{We report a self-powered, single-electrode-based triboelectric sensor
   (SE-TES) array for detecting object motion inside of a plastic tube.
   This innovative, cost-effective, simple-designed SE-TES consists of
   thin-film-based ring-shaped Cu electrodes and a polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE) tube. On the basis of the coupling effect between
   triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, the sensor generates
   electric output signals in response to mechanical motion of an object
   (such as a ball) passing through the electrodes. An array of Cu
   electrodes linearly aligned along the tube enables the detection of
   location and speed of the moving steel ball inside. The signal-to-noise
   ratio of this fabricated device reached 5.3 x 10(3). Furthermore, we
   demonstrated real-time monitoring and mapping of the motion
   characteristics of the steel ball inside the tube by using a seven-unit
   array of electrode channels arranged along the tube. Triggered by the
   output current signal, LED bulbs were utilized as real-time indicators
   of the position of a rolling ball. In addition, the SE-TES also shows
   the capability of detecting blockage in a water pipe. This work
   demonstrates potentially widespread applications of the triboelectric
   sensor in a self-powered tracking system, blockage detection, flow
   control, and logistics monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of single event transients (SETs) on single-pole double-throw
   (SPDT) RF switch circuits designed in a commercially-available, 180 nm
   second-generation SiGe BiCMOS (IBM 7HP) technology is investigated. The
   intended application for these SPDT RF switches requires a 1 GHz to 20
   GHz band of operation, relatively low insertion loss (< 3.0 dB at 20
   GHz), and moderate isolation (> 15 dB at 20 GHz). Two-photon absorption
   experiment results reveal that the SPDT switches are vulnerable to SETs
   due to biasing effects as well as the triple-well (TW) nFETs, which are
   found to be more sensitive to SETs than bulk nFETs. From these results,
   potential implications are discussed and mitigation strategies are
   proposed. To verify one of the proposed mitigation techniques, SPDT
   switches were also designed in a 180 nm twin-well SOI CMOS (IBM 7RF-SOI)
   technology. A different biasing technique is implemented to help improve
   the SET response. The fabricated SOI SPDT switches achieve an insertion
   loss of < 1.04 dB at 20 GHz and > 21 dB isolation at 20 GHz. For this
   circuit, no transients were observed even at very high laser energies
   (approximate to 5 nJ).}},

Abstract = {{We consider a cooperation scenario between primary users and untrusted
   secondary users in cognitive radio networks. The secondary users are
   willing to help the primary users to relay the primary users' messages
   in reward for being allowed to share the primary users' spectrum bands.
   However, the primary users might be reluctant to accept this help, since
   the secondary users are untrustworthy and may try unauthorized decoding
   of the primary users' messages. This paper will answer the question:
   when is this cooperation mutually beneficial for primary and secondary
   users? Taking an approach of information-theoretic secrecy, such as
   coding techniques for wiretap channels, the primary users can allow the
   secondary users to sense and relay the message, while ensuring that the
   secondary users are ignorant of the primary users' messages. We
   characterize an achievable secrecy rate of primary users with a rate of
   the secondary users' communication. From the derived rate pairs, an
   optimization problem is formulated such that the secondary transmitter
   distributes its transmit power to maximize its data rate while providing
   a higher secrecy rate to the primary users. We demonstrate that this
   cooperation can provide a positive secrecy rate, even when a
   non-cooperative scheme achieves a zero secrecy rate.}},

Abstract = {{Perfect graphene is believed to be the strongest material. However, the
   useful strength of large-area graphene with engineering relevance is
   usually determined by its fracture toughness, rather than the intrinsic
   strength that governs a uniform breaking of atomic bonds in perfect
   graphene. To date, the fracture toughness of graphene has not been
   measured. Here we report an in situ tensile testing of suspended
   graphene using a nanomechanical device in a scanning electron
   microscope. During tensile loading, the pre-cracked graphene sample
   fractures in a brittle manner with sharp edges, at a breaking stress
   substantially lower than the intrinsic strength of graphene. Our
   combined experiment and modelling verify the applicability of the
   classic Griffith theory of brittle fracture to graphene. The fracture
   toughness of graphene is measured as the critical stress intensity
   factor of 4.0 +/- 0.6 MPa root m and the equivalent critical strain
   energy release rate of 15.9 Jm(-2). Our work quantifies the essential
   fracture properties of graphene and provides mechanistic insights into
   the mechanical failure of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{An inkjet printing approach is presented for the facile fabrication of
   microscopic arrays of biocompatible silk ``nests{''} capable of hosting
   live cells for prospective biosensors. The patterning of silk fibroin
   nests were constructed by the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of silk
   polyelectrolytes chemically modified with poly-(L-lysine) and
   poly-(L-glutamic acid) side chains. The inkjet-printed silk circular
   regions with a characteristic ``nest{''} shape had diameters of 70-100
   mu m and a thickness several hundred nanometers were stabilized by ionic
   pairing and by the formation of the silk II crystalline secondary
   structure. These ``locked-in{''} silk nests remained anchored to the
   substrate during incubation in cell growth media to provide a
   biotemplated platform for printing-in, immobilization, encapsulation and
   growth of cells. The process of inkjet-assisted printing is versatile
   and can be applied on any type of substrate, including rigid and
   flexible, with scalability and facile formation.}},

Abstract = {{The development of effective therapeutic strategies against prostate
   cancer bone metastases has been impeded by the lack of adequate animal
   models that are able to recapitulate the biology of the disease in
   humans. Bioengineered approaches allow researchers to create
   sophisticated experimentally and physiologically relevant in vivo models
   to study interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment
   under reproducible conditions. The aim of this study was to engineer a
   morphologically and functionally intact humanized organ bone which can
   serve as a homing site for human prostate cancer cells. Transplantation
   of biodegradable tubular composite scaffolds seeded with human
   mesenchymal progenitor cells and loaded with rhBMP-7 resulted in the
   development of a chimeric bone construct including a large number of
   human mesenchymal cells which were shown to be metabolically active and
   capable of producing extracellular matrix components. Micro-CT analysis
   demonstrated that the newly formed ossicle recapitulated the
   morphological features of a physiological organ bone with a trabecular
   network surrounded by a cortex-like outer structure. This
   microenvironment was supportive of the lodgement and maintenance of
   murine haematopoietic cell clusters, thus mimicking a functional organ
   bone. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that luciferase-transduced
   human PC3 cells reproducibly homed to the humanized tissue engineered
   bone constructs, proliferated, and developed macro-metastases. This
   model allows the analysis of interactions between human prostate cancer
   cells and a functional humanized bone organ within an immuno-incompetent
   murine host. The system can serve as a reproducible platform to study
   effects of therapeutics against prostate cancer bone metastases within a
   humanized microenvironment. Crown Copyright (c) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{Existing and proposed metrics for household drinking-water services are
   intended to measure the availability, safety and accessibility of water
   sources. However, these attributes can be highly variable over time and
   space and this variation complicates the task of creating and
   implementing simple and scalable metrics. In this paper, we highlight
   those factors especially those that relate to so-called improved water
   sources - that contribute to variability in water safety but may not be
   generally recognized as important by non-experts. Problems in the
   provision of water in adequate quantities and of adequate quality
   interrelated problems that are often influenced by human behaviour - may
   contribute to an increased risk of poor health. Such risk may be masked
   by global water metrics that indicate that we are on the way to meeting
   the worlds drinking-water needs. Given the complexity of the topic and
   current knowledge gaps, international metrics for access to drinking
   water should be interpreted with great caution. We need further targeted
   research on the health impacts associated with improvements in
   drinking-water supplies.}},

   Sequencing}},
Journal = {{CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{293-305}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Targeted genome editing with engineered nucleases has transformed the
   ability to introduce precise sequence modifications at almost any site
   within the genome. A major obstacle to probing the efficiency and
   consequences of genome editing is that no existing method enables the
   frequency of different editing events to be simultaneously measured
   across a cell population at any endogenous genomic locus. We have
   developed a method for quantifying individual genome-editing outcomes at
   any site of interest with single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA
   sequencing. We show that this approach can be applied at various loci
   using multiple engineered nuclease platforms, including
   transcription-activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), RNA-guided
   endonucleases (CRISPR/Cas9), and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), and in
   different cell lines to identify conditions and strategies in which the
   desired engineering outcome has occurred. This approach offers a
   technique for studying double-strand break repair, facilitates the
   evaluation of gene-editing technologies, and permits sensitive
   quantification of editing outcomes in almost every experimental system
   used.}},

   morphology}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{42-52}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A finite element model was developed at the single fiber length scale to
   predict the quasi-static pullout response of individual fibers from
   cementitious composites. The model accounts for energy dissipation
   through granular flow of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) and
   matrix, plastic work in the fiber, and frictional dissipation at the
   fiber-ITZ interface. The considered fiber morphology was a triangular
   cross section that had been uniformly twisted along the fiber length.
   The model was calibrated to published experimental data for fiber
   pitches of 12.7 and 38.1 mm/revolution pulled from cement mortar with a
   44-MPa unconfined compressive strength. The model was used to
   investigate slip-hardening behavior, tunneling of the cement mortar, in
   situ pullout behavior of helically twisted fibers at a crack plane, and
   provide an alternate explanation for the pullout response of twisted
   fibers from a 84-MPa unconfined compressive strength matrix containing
   silica fume. Calculations show that twisted fibers can provide up to 5
   times the peak pullout force and 10 times the total work compared
   with,straight fibers and infer work-hardening behavior during fiber
   pullout. The findings indicate that the tailoring of fiber morphology
   and control of constituent properties are important avenues for
   achieving significant improvements in the performance of
   fiber-reinforced cementitious composites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Currently used xenograft models for prostate cancer bone metastasis lack
   the adequate tissue composition necessary to study the interactions
   between human prostate cancer cells and the human bone microenvironment.
   We introduce a tissue engineering approach to explore the interactions
   between human tumor cells and a humanized bone microenvironment.
   Scaffolds, seeded with human primary osteoblasts in conjunction with
   BMP7, were implanted into immunodeficient mice to form humanized tissue
   engineered bone constructs (hTEBCs) which consequently resulted in the
   generation of highly vascularized and viable humanized bone. At 12
   weeks, PC3 and LNCaP cells were injected into the hTEBCs. Seven weeks
   later the mice were euthanized. Micro-CT, histology, TRAP, PTHrP and
   osteocalcin staining results reflected the different characteristics of
   the two cell lines regarding their phenotypic growth pattern within
   bone. Microvessel density, as assessed by vWF staining, showed that
   tumor vessel density was significantly higher in LNCaP injected hTEBC
   implants than in those injected with PC3 cells (p < 0.001).
   Interestingly, PC3 cells showed morphological features of epithelial and
   mesenchymal phenotypes suggesting a cellular plasticity within this
   microenvironment. Taken together, a highly reproducible humanized model
   was established which is successful in generating LNCaP and PC3 tumors
   within a complex humanized bone microenvironment. This model simulates
   the conditions seen clinically more closely than any other model
   described in the literature to date and hence represents a powerful
   experimental platform that can be used in future work to investigate
   specific biological questions relevant to bone metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns of ecosystem productivity arise from the
   terrain-modulated wetting and drying of the landscape. Using a daily
   relative greenness (rG) index, we explore the relations between spatial
   variability of plant productivity and landscape morphology, and how
   these relations change over time. The rG index is defined as a measure
   of local vegetation greenness relative to the site's mean greenness,
   calculated from remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index.
   We analyse two semiarid grasslands with pronounced topography, one
   located in southeastern Arizona, with a mean annual precipitation of 350
   mm, and the other in central New Mexico, with a mean annual
   precipitation of 250 mm. Our results indicate that (1) rG is spatially
   more uniform after wet conditions (higher biomass) than after dry
   conditions (lower biomass); (2) differences in the relative frequency
   distribution of rG among different landscape morphologies (ridges,
   unchanneled valleys and channels) indicate higher productivity in
   channels, similar coefficient of variation in all process domains, and
   higher skewness in the ridges; (3) relatively high correlations between
   the binned average rG with respect to upstream area, curvature, and
   annual insolation in more than 80\% of the terrain indicate a clear
   dependence between ecosystem productivity and topography; (4) rG is more
   sensitive to changes in topographic indices at the wetter Arizona study
   site. Such improved understanding of vegetation-topography dependence is
   critical for ecosystem management, testing ecohydrologic models, and
   offers ideas for the downscaling of coarse-scale satellite-derived
   vegetation indices. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Performance evaluation of a thermodynamic system under off-design
   conditions is very important for reliable and cost-effective operation.
   In this study, an off-design model of an organic Rankine cycle driven by
   solar energy is established with compound parabolic collector (CPC) to
   collect the solar radiation and thermal storage unit to achieve the
   continuous operation of the overall system. The system off-design
   behavior is examined under the change in environment temperature, as
   well as thermal oil mass flow rates of vapor generator and CPC. In
   addition, the off-design performance of the system is analyzed over a
   whole day and in different months. The results indicate that a decrease
   in environment temperature, or the increases in thermal oil mass flow
   rates of vapor generator and CPC could improve the off-design
   performance. The system obtains the maximum average exergy efficiency in
   December and the maximum net power output in June or in September. Both
   the net power output and the average exergy efficiency reach minimum
   values in August. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In dimensional inspection using coordinate measuring machines (CMMs),
   the following issues are critical to achieve accurate inspection while
   minimizing the cost and time: 1) How can we select the sampling
   positions of the measurements so that we can get as much information
   from a limited number of samples as possible and 2) given the limited
   number of measurements, how can we assess the form error so that one can
   reliably decide whether the product is acceptable? To address these
   problems, we propose a wavelet-based model that takes advantage of the
   fact that the Lipschitz regularity holds for the CMM data. Under the
   framework of the proposed model, we derive the optimal sampling
   positions and propose a systematic procedure to estimate the form error
   given the limited number of sampled points. The proposed method is
   validated using both synthetic and real CMM data sets for straightness
   measurements. The comparison with other existing methods demonstrates
   the effectiveness of our method.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate process control in Distributed Sensor Networks (DSNs) is an
   important and challenging topic. Although a fully deployed sensor
   network will minimize information loss, the associated sensing cost can
   be overwhelming. Many efforts have been made to investigate the optimal
   sensor allocation strategy for different process control applications;
   however, most of them assume that the sensor layout is fixed once
   sensors are deployed in the system. This paper proposes a novel approach
   to adaptively reallocate sensor resources based on online observations,
   which can enhance both monitoring and diagnosis capabilities. The
   proposed adaptive sensor allocation strategy addresses two fundamental
   issues: when to reallocate sensors and how to update sensor layout. A
   max-min criterion is developed to manage sensor reallocation and process
   change detection in an integrated manner. To investigate the adaptive
   strategy, a Bayesian Network (BN) model is assumed available to
   represent the causal relationships among a set of variables. Case
   studies are performed on a hot forming process and a cap alignment
   process to illustrate the procedure and evaluate the performance of the
   proposed method under different fault scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal psychovisual modulation (TPVM) is a newly proposed information
   display paradigm, which can be implemented by nonnegative matrix
   factorization (NMF) with additional upper bound constraints on the
   variables. In this paper, we study all the state-of-the-art algorithms
   in NMF, extend them to incorporate the upper bounds and discuss their
   potential use in TPVM. By comparing all the NMF algorithms with their
   extended versions, we find that: 1) the factorization error of the
   truncated alternating least squares algorithm always fluctuates
   throughout the iterations, 2) the alternating nonnegative least squares
   based algorithms may slow down dramatically under the upper bound
   constraints, and 3) the hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS)
   algorithm converges the fastest and its final factorization error is
   often the smallest among all the algorithms. Based on the experimental
   results of the HALS, we propose a guideline of determining the parameter
   setting of TPVM, that is, the number of viewers to support and the
   scaling factor for adjusting the light intensity of the images formed by
   TPVM. This paper will facilitate the applications of TPVM.}},

Abstract = {{Although solid-state drives (SSDs) offer significant performance
   improvements over hard disk drives (HDDs) for a number of workloads,
   they can exhibit substantial variance in request latency and throughput
   as a result of garbage collection (GC). When GC conflicts with an I/O
   stream, the stream can make no forward progress until the GC cycle
   completes. GC cycles are scheduled by logic internal to the SSD based on
   several factors such as the pattern, frequency, and volume of write
   requests. When SSDs are used in a RAID with currently available
   technology, the lack of coordination of the SSD-local GC cycles
   amplifies this performance variance. We propose a global garbage
   collection (GGC) mechanism to improve response times and reduce
   performance variability for a RAID of SSDs. We include a high-level
   design of SSD-aware RAID controller and GGC-capable SSD devices and
   algorithms to coordinate the GGC cycles. We develop reactive and
   proactive GC coordination algorithms and evaluate their I/O performance
   and block erase counts for various workloads. Our simulations show that
   GC coordination by a reactive scheme improves average response time and
   reduces performance variability for a wide variety of enterprise
   workloads. For bursty, write-dominated workloads, response time was
   improved by 69 percent and performance variability was reduced by 71
   percent. We show that a proactive GC coordination algorithm can further
   improve the I/O response times by up to 9 percent and the performance
   variability by up to 15 percent. We also observe that it could increase
   the lifetimes of SSDs with some workloads (e. g., Financial) by reducing
   the number of block erase counts by up to 79 percent relative to a
   reactive algorithm for write-dominant enterprise workloads.}},

Abstract = {{Soils containing iron oxides that are derived from chemical weathering
   are widespread in geotechnical systems. This work studies the effect of
   adsorbed iron oxides on the shear strength of laboratory-prepared iron

   showed that hematite-coated sands exhibited the roughest surfaces.
   N2-adsorption experiments also helped characterize the mineral surfaces.
   Shear strength parameters were obtained through consolidated drained
   (CD) triaxial compression, showing an increase in the critical state
   friction angle of more than 5\% when the sands were coated with iron
   oxides. Iron oxide coatings also increased dilatancy and decreased

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Repetitive loading can induce volumetric and shear strain accumulation
   in soils and affect the long-term performance of engineered and natural
   geosystems. A hybrid numerical scheme based on the FEM is implemented to
   analyze problems where a very large number of cycles is involved. The
   numerical approach combines a classical mechanical constitutive model to
   simulate the static load and the first load cycle and empirical
   accumulation functions to track the accumulation of deformations during
   repetitive loading. The hybrid model captures fundamental
   characteristics of soil behavior under repetitive loading, such as
   threshold strains, terminal density, and ratcheting response; it also
   predicts volumetric and shear strains as a function of the static stress
   obliquity, the number of load cycles, and the plastic strain during the
   first load cycle. The proposed numerical scheme is used to analyze
   shallow foundations subjected to repetitive loads. Results show the
   evolution of vertical settlement, horizontal displacement, footing
   rotation, and stress redistribution within the soil mass as the number
   of load cycles increases. Displacements and rotation are more pronounced
   as the static factor of safety decreases and the cyclic load amplitude

Title = {{Iterative image-domain decomposition for dual-energy CT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Dual energy CT (DECT) imaging plays an important role in
   advanced imaging applications due to its capability of material
   decomposition. Direct decomposition via matrix inversion suffers from
   significant degradation of image signal-to-noise ratios, which reduces
   clinical values of DECT. Existing denoising algorithms achieve
   suboptimal performance since they suppress image noise either before or
   after the decomposition and do not fully explore the noise statistical
   properties of the decomposition process. In this work, the authors
   propose an iterative image-domain decomposition method for noise
   suppression in DECT, using the full variance-covariance matrix of the
   decomposed images.
   Methods: The proposed algorithm is formulated in the form of
   least-square estimation with smoothness regularization. Based on the
   design principles of a best linear unbiased estimator, the authors
   include the inverse of the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the
   decomposed images as the penalty weight in the least-square term. The
   regularization term enforces the image smoothness by calculating the
   square sum of neighboring pixel value differences. To retain the
   boundary sharpness of the decomposed images, the authors detect the
   edges in the CT images before decomposition. These edge pixels have
   small weights in the calculation of the regularization term. Distinct
   from the existing denoising algorithms applied on the images before or
   after decomposition, the method has an iterative process for noise
   suppression, with decomposition performed in each iteration. The authors
   implement the proposed algorithm using a standard conjugate gradient
   algorithm. The method performance is evaluated using an evaluation
   phantom (Catphan(C)600) and an anthropomorphic head phantom. The results
   are compared with those generated using direct matrix inversion with no
   noise suppression, a denoising method applied on the decomposed images,
   and an existing algorithm with similar formulation as the proposed
   method but with an edge-preserving regularization term.
   Results: On the Catphan phantom, the method maintains the same spatial
   resolution on the decomposed images as that of the CT images before
   decomposition (8 pairs/cm) while significantly reducing their noise
   standard deviation. Compared to that obtained by the direct matrix
   inversion, the noise standard deviation in the images decomposed by the
   proposed algorithm is reduced by over 98\%. Without considering the
   noise correlation properties in the formulation, the denoising scheme
   degrades the spatial resolution to 6 pairs/cm for the same level of
   noise suppression. Compared to the edge-preserving algorithm, the method
   achieves better low-contrast detectability. A quantitative study is
   performed on the contrast-rod slice of Catphan phantom. The proposed
   method achieves lower electron density measurement error as compared to
   that by the direct matrix inversion, and significantly reduces the error
   variation by over 97\%. On the head phantom, the method reduces the
   noise standard deviation of decomposed images by over 97\% without
   blurring the sinus structures.
   Conclusions: The authors propose an iterative image-domain decomposition
   method for DECT. The method combines noise suppression and material
   decomposition into an iterative process and achieves both goals
   simultaneously. By exploring the full variance-covariance properties of
   the decomposed images and utilizing the edge predetection, the proposed
   algorithm shows superior performance on noise suppression with high
   image spatial resolution and low-contrast detectability. (C) 2014

Title = {{Partitioned edge-function-scaled region-based active contour (p-ESRAC):
   Automated liver segmentation in multiphase contrast-enhanced MRI}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
   (CE-MRI), liver segmentation is an important preprocessing step for the
   computer-aided evaluation of liver disease. However, because of the
   liver's irregular shape, proximity to surrounding organs, and large
   intensity variation, and peripheral contrast enhancement in the kidney,
   liver segmentation has been very challenging. This paper presents a
   novel hybrid active contour model and overall procedures that are
   specific to liver segmentation.
   Methods: The authors introduced an edge-function-scaled (weighted)
   region-based active contour model (ESRAC) and utilization of registered,
   multiphase sequences to address leakage-to-kidney and oversegmentation
   problems. The model incorporated weighted regional information with a
   compactly supported edge map, computed from a combination of images
   obtained during arterial and delayed phases, and it was coupled with a
   geodesic edge term. To cope with signal-inhomogeneity on MRI, all of the
   axial slices were partitioned into eight sectors with an angular span of
   45 degrees, centered on the inferior vena cava, each in the superior and
   inferior regions and the regional information regarding ESRAC was
   computed for each partition, henceforth the so-called partitioned ESRAC
   (p-ESRAC). Initialization of the active contour was performed by
   thresholding with a range of {[} 200, +infinity) and simple
   morphological operation during the delayed phase. At the end, to fill
   the holes in the segmented images caused by high gradients around the
   vasculature, noise, or outstanding texture features, iterative
   morphological operations were performed until convergence. The authors
   compared the segmentation accuracy of p-ESRAC to that with geodesic
   active contour, region-based active contour, geodesic active region, and
   localized region-based active contour using quantitative and visual
   assessments.
   Results: In three-dimensional experimental studies conducted on 30
   subjects (14 normal or benign cases and 16 malignant cases), compared
   with other active contours, p-ESRAC achieved the highest dice similarity
   coefficients of 93.9 +/- 1.6\% (normal) and 91.6 +/- 2.2\% (malignant),
   respectively. In addition, p-ESRAC resulted in the lowest false positive
   rates of 4.5 +/- 3.2\% (normal) and 7.9 +/- 3.0\% (malignant),
   demonstrating it to be the most effective in reducing oversegmentation.
   The partition scheme improved segmentation accuracy by 5.4 +/- 9.2\%
   (normal) and 22.2 +/- 27.6\% (malignant) of the true segmentation that
   was missed by ESRAC. Visual assessment confirmed that p-ESRAC prevented
   leakage of the segmentation results of the liver into the kidney.
   Conclusions: A novel active-contour model was developed, allowing for
   accurate liver segmentation on multiphase CE-MRI, with conditions that
   include signal inhomogeneity and weak boundary conditions. Such a
   technique could be useful for applications that involve computer-aided
   diagnosis of liver disease. (c) 2014 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{Although engineered nucleases can efficiently cleave intracellular DNA
   at desired target sites, major concerns remain on potential `off-target'
   cleavage that may occur throughout the genome. We developed an online
   tool: predicted report of genome-wide nuclease off-target sites
   (PROGNOS) that effectively identifies off-target sites. The initial
   bioinformatics algorithms in PROGNOS were validated by predicting 44 of
   65 previously confirmed off-target sites, and by uncovering a new
   off-target site for the extensively studied zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)
   targeting C-C chemokine receptor type 5. Using PROGNOS, we rapidly
   interrogated 128 potential off-target sites for newly designed
   transcription activator-like effector nucleases containing either
   Asn-Asn (NN) or Asn-Lys (NK) repeat variable di-residues (RVDs) and 3-
   and 4-finger ZFNs, and validated 13 bona fide off-target sites for these
   nucleases by DNA sequencing. The PROGNOS algorithms were further refined
   by incorporating additional features of nuclease-DNA interactions and
   the newly confirmed off-target sites into the training set, which
   increased the percentage of bona fide off-target sites found within the
   top PROGNOS rankings. By identifying potential off-target sites in
   silico, PROGNOS allows the selection of more specific target sites and
   aids the identification of bona fide off-target sites, significantly
   facilitating the design of engineered nucleases for genome editing
   applications.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have become a
   powerful tool for genome editing due to the simple code linking the
   amino acid sequences of their DNA-binding domains to TALEN nucleotide
   targets. While the initial TALEN-design guidelines are very useful,
   user-friendly tools defining optimal TALEN designs for robust genome
   editing need to be developed. Here we evaluated existing guidelines and
   developed new design guidelines for TALENs based on 205 TALENs tested,
   and established the scoring algorithm for predicting TALEN activity
   (SAPTA) as a new online design tool. For any input gene of interest,
   SAPTA gives a ranked list of potential TALEN target sites, facilitating
   the selection of optimal TALEN pairs based on predicted activity.
   SAPTA-based TALEN designs increased the average intracellular TALEN
   monomer activity by >3-fold, and resulted in an average endogenous
   gene-modification frequency of 39\% for TALENs containing the repeat
   variable di-residue NK that favors specificity rather than activity. It
   is expected that SAPTA will become a useful and flexible tool for
   designing highly active TALENs for genome-editing applications. SAPTA

Abstract = {{While therapeutic drugs are routinely self-administered by patients,
   there is little precedent for self-vaccination. Convenient
   self-vaccination may expand vaccination coverage and reduce
   administration costs. Microneedle patches are in development for many
   vaccines, but no reports exist on usability or acceptability. We
   hypothesized that naive patients could apply patches and that
   self-administered patches would improve stated intent to receive an
   influenza vaccine. We conducted a randomized, repeated measures study
   with 91 venue-recruited adults. To simulate vaccination, subjects
   received placebo microneedle patches given three times by
   self-administration and once by the investigator, as well as an
   intramuscular injection of saline. Seventy participants inserted patches
   with thumb pressure alone and the remainder used snap-based devices that
   closed shut at a certain force. Usability was assessed by skin staining
   and acceptability was measured with an adaptive-choice analysis. The
   best usability was seen with the snap device, with users inserting a
   median value of 93-96\% of microneedles over three repetitions. When a
   self-administered microneedle patch was offered, intent to vaccinate
   increased from 44\% to 65\% (CI: 55-74\%). The majority of those
   intending vaccination would prefer to self-vaccinate: 64\% (CI:
   51-75\%). There were no serious adverse events associated with use of
   microneedle patches. The findings from this initial study indicate that
   microneedle patches for self-vaccination against influenza are usable
   and may lead to improved vaccination coverage. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nanocomposite hydrogels were developed by cross-linking nanofibrillated

   stability, mechanical strength, and modulus increased with an increase
   in the amount of nanocellulose in hydrogels, and this can be attributed
   to efficient cross-linking between the nanocellulose and the matrix. The
   addition of softwood nanocellulose showed much higher strength and
   strain properties in the hydrogels than with the addition of hardwood
   nano cellulose. The enhanced physical properties confirm that in situ

Abstract = {{Fibrinogen is one of the primary components of the coagulation cascade
   and rapidly forms an insoluble matrix following tissue injury. In
   addition to its important role in hemostasis, fibrin acts as a scaffold
   for tissue repair and provides important cues for directing cell
   phenotype following injury. Because of these properties and the ease of
   polymerization of the material, fibrin has been widely utilized as a
   biomaterial for over a century. Modifying the macroscopic properties of
   fibrin, such as elasticity and porosity, has been somewhat elusive until
   recently, yet with a molecular-level rational design approach it can now
   be somewhat easily modified through alterations of molecular
   interactions key to the protein's polymerization process. This review
   outlines the biochemistry of fibrin and discusses methods for
   modification of molecular interactions and their application to fibrin
   based biomaterials. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear, negatively charged polysaccharides
   that interact with a variety of positively charged growth factors. In
   this review article the effects of engineering GAG chemistry for
   molecular delivery applications in regenerative medicine are presented.
   Three major areas of focus at the structure-function-property interface
   are discussed: (1) macromolecular properties of GAGs; (2) effects of
   chemical modifications on protein binding; (3) degradation mechanisms of
   GAGs. GAG-protein interactions can be based on: (1) GAG sulfation
   pattern; (2) GAG carbohydrate conformation; (3) GAG polyelectrolyte
   behavior. Chemical modifications of GAGs, which are commonly performed
   to engineer molecular delivery systems, affect protein binding and are
   highly dependent on the site of modification on the GAG molecules. The
   rate and mode of degradation can determine the release of molecules as
   well as the length of GAG fragments to which the cargo is
   electrostatically coupled and eventually released from the delivery
   system. Overall, GAG-based polymers are a versatile biomaterial platform
   offering novel means to engineer molecular delivery systems with a high
   degree of control in order to better treat a range of degenerated or
   injured tissues. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Controlled modulation of immune response, especially the balance between
   immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive responses, is critical for a
   variety of clinical applications, including immunotherapies against
   cancer and infectious diseases, treatment of autoimmune disorders,
   transplant surgeries, regenerative medicine, prosthetic implants, etc.
   Our ability to precisely modify both innate and adaptive immune
   responses could provide new therapeutic directions in a variety of
   diseases. In the context of vaccines and immunotherapies, the interplay
   between antigen-presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells and macrophages),
   B cells, T helper and killer subtypes, and regulatory T- and B-cell
   responses is critical for generating effective immunity against cancer,
   infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. In recent years,
   immunoengineering has emerged as a new field that uses quantitative
   engineering tools to understand molecular-, cellular- and system-level
   interactions of the immune system and to develop design-driven
   approaches to control and modulate immune responses. Biomaterials are an
   integral part of this engineering toolbox and can exploit the intrinsic
   biological and mechanical cues of the immune system to directly modulate
   and train immune cells and direct their response to a particular
   phenotype. A large body of literature exists on strategies to evade or
   suppress the immune response in implants, transplantation and
   regenerative medicine. This review specifically focuses on the use of
   biomaterials for immunostimulation and controlled modulation, especially
   in the context of vaccines and immunotherapies against cancer,
   infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. Bioengineering smart
   systems that can simultaneously deliver multiple bioactive agents in a
   controlled manner or can work as a niche for in situ priming and
   modulation of the immune system could significantly enhance the efficacy
   of next-generation immunotherapeutics. In this review, we describe our
   perspective on the important design aspects for the development of
   biomaterials that can actively modulate immune responses by stimulating
   receptor complexes and cells, and delivering multiple immunomodulatory
   biomolecules. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Many biomaterials constructed today are complex chemical structures that
   incorporate biologically active components derived from nature, but the
   field can still be said to be in its infancy. The need for materials
   that bring sophisticated properties of structure, dynamics and function
   to medical and nonmedical applications will only grow. Increasing
   appreciation of the functionality of biological systems has caused
   biomaterials researchers to consider nature for design inspiration, and
   many examples exist of the use of biomolecular motifs. Yet evolution,
   nature's only engine for the creation of new designs, has been largely
   ignored by the biomaterials community. Molecular evolution is an
   emerging tool that enables one to apply nature's engineering principles
   to non-natural situations using variation and selection. The purpose of
   this review is to highlight the most recent advances in the use of
   molecular evolution in synthetic biology applications for biomaterial
   engineering, and to discuss some of the areas in which this approach may
   be successfully applied in the future.(c) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Recent progress in facet-controlled syntheses has started to produce
   nanocrystals with great promise as the next-generation catalysts for a
   variety of applications. To move from academic studies to industrial
   applications, however, one has to address the issue of scaling up a
   synthesis that has been commonly conducted in a batch format. There are
   two opposite approaches to scaling up the production of colloidal
   nanocrystals: increasing and decreasing the reaction volume. Contrary to
   conventional wisdom, continuous flow synthesis based on droplets is
   expected to provide a more practical platform for scaling up the
   synthesis. Here we highlight recent progress in using droplet reactors
   for the synthesis of colloidal noble-metal nanocrystals with controlled
   sizes and shapes, with an aim towards high-volume production.}},

Abstract = {{Ignition of preheated (400-500 K) H-2-air mixtures at low pressures
   (80-100 torr) excited by pulsed nanosecond dielectric barrier discharges
   is investigated through experiments and simulations. Time resolved
   absolute OH concentration and temperature data are obtained using Laser
   Induced Fluorescence (LIF) technique. Ignition is achieved in the
   decaying plasma after a burst of discharge pulses (repetition rate 10-40
   kHz), with the time delay inferred from sudden rise in OH{*} emission.
   One-dimensional simulations are performed to obtain information about
   the plasma generated radicals and heat release across the discharge gap.
   A plasma fluid formulation is used with ions and neutral species at gas
   temperature, and electrons in non-equilibrium. An accurate reduced
   chemistry mechanism is developed through sensitivity analysis to
   expedite the plasma simulations. The model predictions show excellent
   agreement with experimental measurements, validating the numerical
   framework and chemistry data. The input pulse energy and ignition
   characteristics are found to be highly sensitive to uncertainties in
   dielectric properties. Ignition delay exhibits a threshold-like
   dependence on input plasma energy, and increases steeply as the number
   of pulses in the burst is reduced. The nanosecond plasma assisted
   ignition is achieved through a two-step process. Firstly, the burst of
   discharge pulses produce a large pool of radicals and provide an average
   temperature rise of similar to 1-2 K/pulse. In the next step, if the
   temperature exceeds a threshold value of similar to 700 K, significant
   heat release from partial fuel oxidation is triggered. The process
   becomes self-sustaining and the temperature continues to rise even after
   the plasma source is switched off, accelerating the conventional H-2-O-2
   chain branching pathways and leading to ignition. We provide conclusive
   evidence of large volume ignition with nanosecond plasma as opposed to
   thermal ignition at a hot-spot. Ignition is first observed at the center
   of the discharge gap, but the kernel expands rapidly to the entire
   volume, except near walls where heat losses keep the temperature low. It
   is demonstrated that the ignition occurs independently at different
   locations due to local plasma chemistry effects and heat transport does
   not play a significant role. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{In the synthesis of the microporous metal-organic framework copper
   1,4-benzenedicarboxylate {[}Cu(BDC)], solvent exchange with methanol

   quantum molecular calculations and refinement with synchrotron X-ray
   powder diffraction data. This solution is in the P (1) over bar space
   group with a = 5.25 angstrom, b = 9.67 angstrom, c = 10.77 angstrom, a =
   90.29 degrees, beta = 91.06 degrees, gamma = 92.413 degrees, and V =

   903 m(2)g(-1) with 777 m(2)g(-1) of micropore surface area. The uptake
   of CO2 and CH4 up to 20 bar were 5.2 and 2.7 mmolg(-1), respectively.
   These values are compared to those of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate
   {[}Cu-3(BTC)(2), HKUST-1] and used to show that the elevated metal-site
   density per unit volume is responsible for a proportionally higher

Abstract = {{Because of the multiple scales in 3-D integrated systems, numerical
   simulation methods that are able to handle multiscale problems
   efficiently are strongly required. In this paper, electrical-thermal
   cosimulation of multiscale integrated systems using Mortar finite
   element-based domain decomposition method is proposed. Using the
   nonconformal domain decomposition approach, integrated systems can be
   divided into separate subdomains. Individual subdomains can be
   discretized independently based on its detailed feature size and
   formulated using the finite element method with associated boundary
   conditions. The coupling between domains is captured using Lagrange
   multipliers. For large multiscale 3-D problems, the cascadic multigrid
   method combined with the subspace confined preconditioned conjugate
   gradient method is used to accelerate the convergence of the solution
   with hierarchical meshing grids. Several examples are simulated and the
   results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the electrical-thermal
   cosimulation using nonconformal domain decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal coupling between superlattice coolers (SLCs) in an array
   adversely affects performance of an each individual cooler compared with
   an isolated device. Here, we have developed an electrothermal model to
   study this coupling between SLCs and how it is affected by geometric
   parameters such as separation between the superlattice structure and a
   ground electrode, and operating parameters such as the convective heat
   transfer coefficient and the activation current applied for driving the
   SLC. Complementary to the modeling efforts, we have also experimentally
   studied thermal coupling between SLCs in a microfabricated array under
   various conditions. Simulation results are critically compared against
   the experimental data and yield the conclusions of importance for an
   optimized design of the hybrid microfluidic SLC cooling scheme for
   thermal management of multiple clustered hotspots in microprocessors. We
   have observed more than 60\% reduction in cooler performance, when
   placed within the few characteristic diameters of the ground electrode,
   due to thermal coupling effect. Thermal properties of the working fluid
   have even more pronounced effect on the thermal coupling between the
   coolers.}},

   to include the parasitic effects of TSV arrays into the system matrix.
   The overall matrix is divided into several subdomains and solved by a

Abstract = {{6FDA-mPDA/DABA (3:2) polyimide was synthesized and characterized for
   uncross-linked, thermally crosslinked, and carbon molecular sieve (CMS)
   membranes. The membranes were characterized with thermogravimetric
   analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and gas
   permeation tests. Variations in the d spacing, the formation of pore
   structures, and changes in the pore sizes of the CMS membranes were
   discussed in relation to pyrolysis protocols. The uncross-linked polymer
   membranes showed high CO2/CH4 selectivity, whereas thermally crosslinked
   membranes exhibited significantly improved CO2 permeability and
   excellent CO2 plasticization resistance. The CMS membranes showed even
   higher CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity. An increase in the
   pyrolysis temperature resulted in CMS membranes with lower gas
   permeability but higher selectivity. The 550 degrees C pyrolyzed CMS
   membranes showed CO2 permeability as high as 14750Barrer with CO2/CH4
   selectivity of approximately 52. Even 800 degrees C pyrolyzed CMS
   membranes still showed high CO2 permeability of 2610Barrer with high

Abstract = {{Departure metering reduces congestion by reducing the number of aircraft
   present on the airport surface at any time while not starving the
   runway. Because some departing flights are held at gates, there is a
   possibility that arriving flights cannot access the gates and have to
   wait until the gates are cleared. This is called a gate conflict. Robust
   gate assignment is an assignment that minimizes gate conflicts by
   assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time gap between two
   consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment robust,
   but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to simulate
   the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The model
   is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York's LaGuardia
   Airport (LGA) and a large U. S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates
   the airport departure process with the current gate assignment and a
   robust gate assignment to assess the impact of gate assignment on
   departure metering. The results show that the robust gate assignment
   reduces the number of gate conflicts caused by departure metering
   compared with the current gate assignment. Therefore, robust gate
   assignment can be combined with departure metering to improve operations
   at congested airports with limited gate resources.}},

Abstract = {{Airport departure operations are a source of airline delays and
   passenger frustration. Excessive surface traffic is a cause of increased
   controller and pilot workload. It is also a source of increased
   emissions and delays, and it does not yield improved runway throughput.
   Leveraging the extensive past research on airport departure management,
   this paper explores the environmental and safety benefits that improved
   surveillance technologies can bring in the context of gate-or
   spot-release strategies. This paper shows that improved surveillance
   technologies can yield a 4\%-6\% reduction of the average number of
   aircraft on the taxiway system during congested operations, and
   therefore emissions, in addition to the savings currently observed by
   implementing threshold-based metering strategies under evaluation at
   Boston's Logan Airport and other busy airports during congested periods.
   These calculated benefits contrast sharply with our previous work, which
   relied on simplified airport ramp areas with a single departure spot and
   where fewer environmental and economic benefits of advanced surface
   surveillance systems could be established. Our work is illustrated by
   its application to New York's LaGuardia and Seattle-Tacoma airports in
   Washington.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a compact configuration of aircraft flows at
   intersections. The goal is to achieve a higher capacity of the airspace,
   allowing more aircraft to safely fly through a fixed region.
   Intersections of aircraft flows can be considered as basic building
   blocks for air traffic networks, and traffic networks can be designed
   through finding optimal arrangements of intersections whose conflict
   zones do not overlap. A conflict zone is defined as a minimal circular
   area centered at the intersection of two flows, which allows aircraft
   approaching the intersections to resolve conflict completely within the
   conflict zone. This paper derives the relationship between the size of a
   conflict zone and the intersection angle of the two flows. Such a
   relationship guides the choice of the most compact configuration for
   intersecting aircraft flows. An example involving multiple converging
   flows of aircraft demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed
   configuration of intersections. The result of conflict resolution shows
   a greatly reduced traffic complexity. Therefore, our study provides a
   potential solution to increase airspace capacity.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop a robust method to assess regional mechanical
   dyssynchrony from cine short-axis MR images. Cardiac resynchronization
   therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for patients with heart failure
   and evidence of left-ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony. Patient response to
   CRT is greatest when the LV pacing lead is placed in the most
   dyssynchronous segment. Existing techniques for assessing regional
   dyssynchrony require difficult acquisition and/or postprocessing. Our
   goal was to develop a widely applicable and robust method to assess
   regional mechanical dyssynchrony.
   Materials and MethodsUsing the endocardial boundary, radial displacement
   curves (RDCs) were generated throughout the LV. Cross-correlation was
   used to determine the delay time between each RDC and a patient-specific
   reference. Delay times were projected onto the American Heart
   Association 17-segment model creating a regional dyssynchrony map. Our
   method was tested in 10 normal individuals and 10 patients enrolled for
   CRT (QRS > 120 ms, NYHA III-IV, EF < 35\%).
   ResultsDelay times over the LV were 23.9 33.8 ms and 93.1 +/- 99.9 ms (P
   < 0.001) in normal subjects and patients, respectively. Interobserver
   reproducibility for segment averages was 6.8 +/- 39.3 ms and there was
   70\% agreement in identifying the latest contracting segment.
   ConclusionWe have developed a method that can reliably calculate
   regional delay times from cine steady-state free-precession (SSFP)
   images. Maps of regional dyssynchrony could be used to identify the
   latest-contracting segment to assist in CRT lead implantation. J. Magn.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{The mobility of dislocation in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals is
   controlled by the thermally activated nucleation of kinks along the
   dislocation core. By employing a recent interatomic potential and the
   Nudged Elastic Band method, we predict the atomistic saddle-point state
   of 1/2(111) screw dislocation motion in BCC iron that involves the
   nucleation of correlated kinkpairs and the resulting double superkinks.
   This unique process leads to a single-humped minimum energy path that
   governs the one-step activation of a screw dislocation to move into the
   adjacent (110) Peierls valley, which contrasts with the double-humped
   energy path and the two-step transition predicted by other interatomic
   potentials. Based on transition state theory, we use the atomistically
   computed, stress-dependent kinkpair activation parameters to inform a
   coarse-grained crystal plasticity flow rule. Our atomistically-informed
   crystal plasticity model quantitatively predicts the orientation
   dependent stress-strain behavior of BCC iron single crystals in a manner
   that is consistent with experimental results. The predicted temperature
   and strain-rate dependencies of the yield stress agree with experimental
   results in the 200350 K temperature regime, and are rationalized by the
   small activation volumes associated with the kinkpair-mediated motion of
   screw dislocations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in thermoelectrics for waste-heat recovery and localized
   cooling has flourished in recent years, but questions about cost and
   scalability remain unanswered. This work investigates the fabrication
   costs and coupled thermal and electrical transport factors that govern
   device efficiency and commercial feasibility of the most promising
   thermoelectric materials. For 30 bulk and thin film thermoelectric
   materials, we quantify the tradeoff between efficiency and cost
   considering electrical and thermal transport at the system level, raw
   material prices, system component costs, and estimated manufacturing
   costs. This work neglects the cost of heat, as appropriate for most
   waste-heat recovery applications, and applies a power generation cost
   metric in VW and a cooling operating cost metric in \$/kWh. The results
   indicate material costs are too high for typical thermoelectric power
   generation applications at mean temperatures below 135 C. Above 275 C,
   many bulk thermoelectric materials can achieve costs below \$1/W. The
   major barrier to economical thermoelectric power generation at these
   higher temperatures results from system costs for heat exchangers and
   ceramic plates. For cooling applications, we find that several
   thermoelectric materials can be cost competitive and commercially
   promising. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fatigue-induced thick oxide formation and its role on fatigue crack
   initiation in Ni thin films at low temperatures}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{156-167}},

Abstract = {{This study highlights an oxidation-assisted fatigue crack initiation
   mechanism in 20 mu.m thick electroplated Ni films under loading
   conditions relevant for a wide range of microelectromechanical systems,
   such as extreme stress gradients at the surface (50\% decrease over the
   first micrometer from the surface). Microresonators subjected to
   in-plane bending at 8 kHz were fatigued for billions of cycles in humid
   air, at 30 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity (RH), and 80 degrees C,
   90\% RH, for maximum stress amplitudes up to similar to 500 MPa(similar
   to 55\% of the ultimate tensile strength). Transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) revealed highly localized thick oxides (similar to 1
   gm) on specimens fatigued for several billions of cycles. These oxides
   are two to three orders of magnitude thicker than the regular native
   oxides at these low temperatures, and only form at the location of
   cyclic slip bands. These oxides appear to be thicker for higher partial
   pressures of water, based on the TEM comparison of one specimen fatigued
   at 30 degrees C, 50\% RH to one fatigued at 80 degrees C, 90\% RH.
   Fatigue microcracks were observed within these highly localized thick
   oxides. Finite element models were also employed to confirm these
   results based on the interpretation of the evolution of the devices'
   resonance frequency. This oxidation-assisted fatigue crack initiation
   mechanism at low temperatures constitutes a significant departure from
   the established mechanisms for bulk metals and their environmental
   effects. A possible explanation for the different governing mechanism is
   the presence of extreme stress gradients in these microscale components.
   Under these loading conditions, the classical fatigue crack initiation
   mechanisms are not operational, allowing this alternative mechanism to
   become dominant. This study highlights the need to further understand
   the coupled size and environmental effects on the fatigue of metallic
   thin films. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Enterococci are common members of the gut microbiome and their ease of
   culturing has facilitated worldwide use as indicators of fecal pollution
   of waters. However, enterococci were recently shown to persist in
   environmental habitats, often in the absence of fecal input, potentially
   confounding water quality assays. Toward resolving this issue and
   providing a more complete picture of natural enterococci diversity, 11
   isolates of Enterococcus faecalis recovered from freshwater watersheds
   (environmental) were sequenced and compared to 59 available enteric
   genomes. Phenotypically and phylogenetically the environmental E.
   faecalis were indistinguishable from their enteric counterparts.
   However, distinct environmental- and enteric-associated gene signatures,
   encoding mostly accessory nutrient utilization pathways, were detected
   among the variable genes. Specifically, a nickel uptake operon was
   over-represented in environmental genomes, while genes for utilization
   of sugars thought to be abundant in the gut such as xylose were
   over-represented in enteric genomes. The distribution and phylogeny of
   these identified signatures suggest that ancestors of E. faecalis
   resided in extra-enteric habitats, challenging the prevailing commensal
   view of enterococci ecology. Thus, habitat-associated gene content
   changes faster than core genome phylogeny and may include biomarkers for
   reliably detecting fecal contaminants for improved microbial water
   quality monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We reformulate a deterministic optimization problem as a filtering
   problem, where the goal is to compute the conditional distribution of
   the unobserved state given the observation history. We prove that in our
   formulation the conditional distribution converges asymptotically to a
   degenerate distribution concentrated on the global optimum. Hence, the
   goal of searching for the global optimum can be achieved by computing
   the conditional distribution. Since this computation is often
   analytically intractable, we approximate it by particle filtering, a
   class of sequential Monte Carlo methods for filtering, which has proven
   convergence in ``tracking{''} the conditional distribution. The
   resultant algorithmic framework unifies some randomized optimization
   algorithms and provides new insights into their connection.}},

Abstract = {{The population of older adults in America is expected to reach an
   unprecedented level in the near future. Some of them have difficulties
   with performing daily tasks and caregivers may not be able to match pace
   with the increasing need for assistance. Robots, especially mobile
   manipulators, have the potential for assisting older adults with daily
   tasks enabling them to live independently in their homes. However,
   little is known about their views of robot assistance in the home.
   Twenty-one independently living older Americans (65-93 years old) were
   asked about their preferences for and attitudes toward robot assistance
   via a structured group interview and questionnaires. In the group
   interview, they generated a diverse set of 121 tasks they would want a
   robot to assist them with in their homes. These data, along with their
   questionnaire responses, suggest that the older adults were generally
   open to robot assistance but were discriminating in their acceptance of
   assistance for different tasks. They preferred robot assistance over
   human assistance for tasks related to chores, manipulating objects, and
   information management. In contrast, they preferred human assistance to
   robot assistance for tasks related to personal care and leisure
   activities. Our study provides insights into older adults' attitudes and
   preferences for robot assistance with everyday living tasks in the home
   which may inform the design of robots that will be more likely accepted
   by older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (GNP)/epoxy resin nanocomposites were
   prepared and tested, varying the amount of the filler content. Systems'
   morphology was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy,
   while their thermal response was examined via differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). Broadband dielectric spectroscopy and dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis were employed in order to characterize the
   produced systems. Static mechanical tests were also conducted at
   ambient. Reinforced systems exhibit improved performance under
   mechanical and electrical excitation. In particular, storage modulus
   increases systematically with GNP content. DSC results imply that glass
   transition temperature is not affected by the presence of GNP. Flexural
   modulus and storage modulus, as determined by static and dynamic
   mechanical tests, respectively, increased with filler content.
   Dielectric permittivity increases also systematically with GNP content.
   Recorded relaxation processes arise from the glass to rubber transition
   of the polymer matrix (alpha-mode), re-orientation of polar side groups
   of the polymer chains (beta-mode), and interfacial polarization because
   of the accumulation of charges at the systems' interface. Finally, the
   energy storing efficiency of the nanocomposites enhances with
   reinforcing phase in the examined frequency and temperature range.
   Optimum performance corresponds to the nanocomposite with maximum GNP
   loading.}},

Abstract = {{Lectin-like Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor 1 (LOX-1) plays a
   key role in atherosclerotic plaque initiation, formation and rupture, as
   well as in hyperlipidemia-induced glomerular disease. Here we report a
   sensitive, specific and biocompatible LOX-1-targeted-USPIO for the
   noninvasive MR imaging of LOX-1 within carotid atherosclerotic lesions
   and glomerular disease in apoE-deficient mice. In vitro analysis showed
   the highest uptake of targeted USPIOs in only activated RAW264.7
   macrophages, and in vivo MRI studies showed signal loss in carotid
   atherosclerotic lesions after administration of targeted USPIOs at 8 h
   and 24 h. These areas of signal loss were correlated with the presence
   of nanoparticles in the atherosclerotic lesions, and
   immunohistochemistry and Perl's staining confirmed the colocalization of
   the LOX-1/macrophages/MMP-9 and targeted nanoparticles. Finally,
   additional studies suggest that this targeted probe may have potential
   to noninvasively image early glomerular disease. This finding may
   provide important methods for characterizing vulnerable atherosclerotic
   plaques and hyperlipidemia-induced glomerular diseases.
   From the Clinical Editor: A functionalized USPIO-based negative contrast
   material was used in this study, demonstrating feasibility of sensitive
   MRI-based detection of atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid
   arteries and in the renal cortex, paving the way to potential future
   clinical applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Successful integration of engineered constructs with host tissues is
   crucial for cartilage repair, yet achieving it remains challenging. A
   collagen I-based fibrous capsule characterized by increased cell density
   and decreased glycosaminoglycan deposition usually forms at the
   periphery of tissue-engineered cartilage. The current study aimed to
   evaluate the effects of a solid fibrous capsule on construct integration
   with native articular cartilage. To this end, capsule-containing (CC)
   and capsule-free (CF) constructs were grown by culturing
   chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds with insulin-like growth factor-1 and
   transforming growth factor-beta 1, respectively, in a wavy-walled
   bioreactor that imparts hydrodynamic forces for 4 weeks. The ability of
   harvested constructs to integrate with native cartilage was determined
   using a cartilage explant model. Our results revealed that adhesive
   stress between native cartilage and the CC constructs was 57\% higher
   than that in the CF group, potentially due to the absence of
   glycosaminoglycans and increased cell density in the capsule region and
   deposition of denser and thicker collagen fibrils at the integration
   site. The present work demonstrates that the fibrous capsule can
   effectively enhance early integration of engineered and native cartilage
   tissues and thus suggests the need to include the capsule as a variable
   in the development of cartilage tissue engineering strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Rendezvous and docking with uncooperative target objects are driving
   capabilities for future robotic on-orbit servicing and space debris
   removal systems. A teleoperation system augments a robotic system with
   the perception, cognition, and decision capabilities of a human
   operator, which can lead to a more capable and more flexible telerobotic
   system. The ThirdEye system was developed in order to support the human
   operator in the complex relative navigation task of final approach and
   docking. It provides the operator with a flexible camera vantage point
   which can be positioned freely in the relevant space around and between
   the chaser and target spacecraft. The primary and secondary camera
   views, an attitude head-up display, and a trajectory prediction display
   are integrated into an intuitive graphical user interface. A validation
   study was conducted to evaluate the effects of this ThirdEye system on
   the performance of the teleoperation system during final approach and
   docking with uncooperative, rotating targets. The results of this study
   show that the ThirdEye system increases the overall task success rate by
   15\% and improves operator situation awareness, without having negative
   impact on the usage of system resources. The partial failure rates are
   decreased by 20-30\%. In high-difficulty scenarios, the operator task
   load is increased due to the dual task of teleoperating the camera arm
   and the spacecraft in tandem, which leads to a minor increase in failure
   rate in these scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine adaptive compression policies, when the
   sequence of vector-valued measurements to be compressed is noisy and the
   compressed variables are themselves noisy. The optimization criterion is
   information gain. In the case of sequential scalar compressions, the
   unit-norm compression vectors that greedily maximize per-stage
   information gain are eigenvectors of an a priori error covariance
   matrix, and the greedy policy selects them according to eigenvalues of a
   posterior covariance matrix. These eigenvalues depend on all previous
   compressions and are computed recursively. A water-filling solution is
   given for the optimum compression policy that maximizes net information
   gain, under a constraint on the average norm of compression vectors. We
   provide sufficient conditions under which the greedy policy for
   maximizing stepwise information gain actually is optimal in the sense of
   maximizing the net information gain. In the case of scalar compressions,
   our examples and simulation results illustrate that the greedy policy
   can be quite close to optimal when the noise sequences are white.}},

Title = {{Value-Based Global Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a value-based global optimization (VGO) algorithm is
   introduced. The algorithm uses kriging-like surrogate models and a
   sequential sampling strategy based on value of information (VoI) to
   optimize an objective characterized by multiple analysis models with
   different accuracies. VGO builds on two main contributions. The first
   contribution is a novel surrogate modeling method that accommodates data
   from any number of different analysis models with varying accuracy and
   cost. Rather than interpolating, it fits a model to the data, giving
   more weight to more accurate data. The second contribution is the use of
   VoI as a new metric for guiding the sequential sampling process for
   global optimization. Based on information about the cost and accuracy of
   each available model, predictions from the current surrogate model are
   used to determine where to sample next and with what level of accuracy.
   The cost of further analysis is explicitly taken into account during the
   optimization process, and no further analysis occurs if the expected
   value of the new information is negative. In this paper, we present the
   details of the VGO algorithm and, using a suite of randomly generated
   test cases, compare its performance with the performance of the
   efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm (Jones, D. R., Matthias,
   S., and Welch, W. J., 1998, ``Efficient Global Optimization of Expensive
   Black-Box Functions,{''} J. Global Optim., 13(4), pp. 455-492). Results
   indicate that the VGO algorithm performs better than EGO in terms of
   overall expected utility-on average, the same quality solution is
   achieved at a lower cost, or a better solution is achieved at the same
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally ultrafine continuous fibers below 1 dpf are produced by

   attenuated by a symmetric cold air jet. Since the formation of the fiber
   structure is highly dependent on the processing conditions, the new
   process provides a unique operation window to study fiber attenuation
   and structural formation under high-speed cold air drawing. A parametric
   study was carried out under different process conditions which included
   processing temperature, air velocity and polymer volume flow rate.
   Effects of changes in processing variables on the fiber diameter,

Abstract = {{While the role of platelets in hemostasis is well characterized from a
   biological perspective, the biophysical interactions between platelets
   and their mechanical microenvironment are relatively unstudied. The
   field of cellular mechanics has developed a number of approaches to
   study the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived mechanical
   forces on various cells, and has elucidated that
   integrin-cytoskeleton-mediated force transduction governs many cellular
   processes. As platelets adhere and spread via molecular machinery that
   is similar to that which enables other cells to mechanosense and
   mechanotransduce forces from their biophysical microenvironment,
   platelets too are likely governed by the same overarching mechanisms.
   Indeed, recent platelet mechanobiology studies have revealed that key
   aspects of platelet physiology and activation are regulated by the
   mechanical and spatial properties of the ECM microenvironment. At the
   same time, there are also key differences that make platelets unique in
   the world of cells- their size, origin as megakaryocyte fragments, and
   unique alpha IIb beta 3 integrin- render their mechanosensing activities
   particularly interesting. The structurally ``simple,{''} anucleate
   nature of platelets coupled with their high actin concentration (20\% of
   total protein) and integrin density {[}1] seem to make them ideal for
   mechanical force generation and transmission. Further studies will
   enhance our understanding of the role of platelet mechanobiology in
   hemostasis and thrombosis, potentially leading to new categories of
   diagnostics that investigate the mechanical properties of clots to
   determine bleeding risk, as well as therapies that target the
   mechanotransduction signaling pathway to alter the stability of clots.

Abstract = {{Deriving bulk materials with ultra-high mechanical strength from
   nanometer-sized single metalic crystals depends on the consolidation
   procedure. We present an accurate molecular dynamics study to quantify
   microstructure responses to consolidation. Aluminum single crystals with
   an average size up to 10.7 nm were hydrostatically compressed at
   temperatures up to 900 K and pressures up to 5 GPa. The consolidated
   material developed an average grain size that grew exponentially with
   the consolidation temperature, with a growth rate dependent on the
   starting average grain size and the consolidation pressure. The
   evolution of the microstructure was accompanied by a significant
   reduction in the concentration of defects. The ratio of vacancies to
   dislocation cores decreased with the average grain size and then
   increased after reaching a critical average grain size. The deformation
   mechanisms of poly-crystalline metals can be better understood in the
   light of the current findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a medium term power portfolio optimization model for
   a power producer in a competitive electricity market, considering
   locational electricity prices and risk management. The methodology
   developed includes modeling the multivariate stochastic evolution of
   locational electricity prices, the construction of a scenario tree that
   represents this evolution, and the formulation and solution of a
   stochastic optimization model. Using this methodology a power producer
   holding thermal generating units in more than one location may maximize
   expected profit while keeping a limited risk exposure. The model
   considers the possibility of trading electricity forward contracts in
   different locations and contracts for difference. In addition, its
   output includes amounts of electricity transactions in locational spot
   markets and power production in generating units. The computational
   experiments performed indicate that the correlation between locational
   electricity prices is very relevant for power producers holding
   generating units in those locations, since it significantly affects the

Abstract = {{With the advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurochemistry
   there has been impressive progress in understanding the molecular
   properties of anesthetic agents. However, there has been little focus on
   how the molecular properties of anesthetic agents lead to the observed
   macroscopic property that defines the anesthetic state, that is, lack of
   responsiveness to noxious stimuli. In this paper, we develop a mean
   field synaptic drive firing rate cortical neuronal model and demonstrate
   how the induction of general anesthesia can be explained using
   multistability; the property whereby the solutions of a dynamical system
   exhibit multiple attracting equilibria under asymptotically slowly
   changing inputs or system parameters. In particular, we demonstrate
   multistability in the mean when the system initial conditions or the
   system coefficients of the neuronal connectivity matrix are random
   variables. Uncertainty in the system coefficients is captured by
   representing system uncertain parameters by a multiplicative white noise
   model wherein stochastic integration is interpreted in the sense of Ito.
   Modeling a priori system parameter uncertainty using a multiplicative
   white noise model is motivated by means of the maximum entropy principle
   of Jaynes and statistical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Insulation failures from electrochemical migration is a major
   reliability concern for achieving reliable small conductor spacings in
   glass fiber reinforced substrates in the presence of humidity and DC
   bias voltage. In this study, insulation reliability of fine-pitch copper
   plated-through-vias in two different halogen-free epoxy substrates was
   investigated using accelerated testing condition (85 A degrees C, 85 \%
   RH and 100 V DC). The test vehicles included two different conductor
   geometry: (1) through-via to through-via (spacing: 100 and 150 mu m) and
   (2) through-via to surface-trace (spacing: 75 mu m). In accelerated
   testing, the through-via to through-via test vehicles exhibited
   insulation failures (failure criterion: 1 Ma{''}broken vertical bar)
   with a strong dependence on via spacing with through-via spacing of 100
   mu m showing significantly shorter time to failures compared to test
   vehicles with spacing of 150 mu m. Failure analysis revealed cracking in
   resin-glass fiber interfaces and within the resin matrix between the
   failed through-vias. The through-via to surface-trace test vehicles, on
   the other hand, did not exhibit failures based on the 1 Ma{''}broken
   vertical bar criterion. However, occurrence of electrochemical migration
   was visible after optical inspection of the test vehicles. Elemental
   characterization revealed the presence of copper and chlorine in the
   resin-glass fiber interface, similar to the previously reported
   chloride-containing conductive anodic filament compound in printed
   wiring boards. Accelerating testing and failure analysis in this study
   indicates a strong dependence of insulation reliability on conductor
   spacing, geometry and substrate material properties.}},

Abstract = {{The relative volume and the limiting low shear viscosity have been
   accurately determined as functions of temperature and pressure for a
   series of eight branched perfluoropolyether liquids. The Murnaghan
   equation of state was fitted to the volumes and three correlations for
   viscosity were examined: the Doolittle free volume, the Bair and
   Casalini thermodynamic scaling, and the improved Yasutomi. The
   ambient-pressure bulk modulus increases gradually with molecular weight
   and is low compared with conventional lubricants. The Doolittle
   parameter increases with molecular mass as does the occupied volume
   fraction. The Ashurst-Hoover interaction parameter decreases with
   increasing molecular mass. The improved Yasutomi model provides accuracy
   comparable to models requiring an equation of state. When the kinematic
   viscosity at 40celcius is greater than about 200 mm(2)/s, fragility is
   independent of pressure. When the kinematic viscosity is less than about
   200 mm(2)/s fragility increases with pressure. The pressure counterpart
   to the Angell plot and to the Vogel, Tammann, and Fulcher equation
   suggested by Drozd-Rzoska etal. is shown to be workable using stability
   limit pressures in the tensile domain. Clearly, progress in quantitative
   elastohydrodynamic lubrication must rely upon accurate measurements of
   the dynamic properties as a function of temperature and pressure and
   upon accurate temperature and pressure correlations for these
   properties. Only then can precise predictions of film thickness and
   friction be made.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting using piezoelectric cantilevers has
   been extensively studied over the past decade. As an alternative to
   cantilevered harvesters, piezoelectric patch harvesters integrated to
   thin plates can be more convenient for use in marine, aerospace and
   automotive applications since these systems are often composed of thin
   plate-like structures with various boundary conditions. In this paper,
   we present analytical electroelastic modeling of a piezoelectric energy
   harvester structurally integrated to a thin plate along with
   experimental validations. The distributed-parameter electroelastic model
   of the thin plate with the piezoceramic patch harvester is developed
   based on Kirchhoff's plate theory for all-four-edges clamped (CCCC)
   boundary conditions. Closed-form steady-state response expressions for
   coupled electrical output and structural vibration are obtained under
   transverse point force excitation. Analytical electroelastic frequency
   response functions (FRFs) relating the voltage output and vibration
   response to force input are derived and generalized for different
   boundary conditions. Experimental validation and extensive theoretical
   analysis efforts are then presented with a case study employing a thin
   PZT-5A piezoceramic patch attached on the surface of a rectangular
   aluminum CCCC plate. The importance of positioning of the piezoceramic
   patch harvester is discussed through an analysis of dynamic strain
   distribution on the overall plate surface. The electroelastic model is
   validated by a comparison of analytical and experimental FRFs for a wide
   range of resistive electrical boundary conditions. Finally, power
   generation performance of the structurally integrated piezoceramic patch
   harvester from multiple vibration modes is investigated analytically and
   experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{That classical elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) is not a
   quantitative field can be illustrated by its failure to provide a
   consistent and rigorous definition of the viscosity-pressure
   coefficient. Indeed, if the pressure dependence of viscosity cannot be
   accurately described, then the viscosity-pressure coefficient cannot be
   defined. Classical EHL has employed fictional narratives to justify the
   pressure dependences that have been utilized. In this context, the
   purpose of this perspective article is to review specific and real needs
   from EHL and to show that data and models describing the
   viscosity-pressure dependence are already available and how they can
   properly be used. The final aim is to encourage researchers to change
   their philosophy of classical EHL to a quantitative approach, in which
   every hypothesis and every result, whether experimental or numerical,
   would be justified on the basis of acceptable physics.}},

   by immersing in solvents}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{178-187}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of carbon nanotube (CNT) forests soaked in three
   solvents - toluene, acetonitrile, and isopropanol - is examined.
   Effective stiffness of the structure is evaluated in the dry and wet
   condition by micro-indentation using a 100 pm flat punch. With soaking
   of CNT forests in solvents, the stiffness decreases and deformation
   mechanism changes from buckling concentrated close to the bottom of the
   CNT forest to a distribution of local buckles along the height and
   global buckling of the entire length of CNTs. We use molecular dynamics
   simulations to relate the experimental observations to the reduced
   mechanical support from neighbor CNTs due to a decreased magnitude of
   van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the presence of solvents. Toluene,
   which produces the lowest average measured stiffness between the three
   solvents, produces the lowest vdW forces between individual CNTs.
   Furthermore, wet-dry cycling of CNT forests shows the reversibility and
   repeatability of change of stiffness by immersing in solvents. The
   results show that soaking CNT forests in solvents could be useful for
   applications such as interface materials where lower stiffness of CNT
   forests are needed and applications such as energy absorbing materials
   in which re-setting of stiffness is required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, dislocation-phonon interactions in fcc crystals are
   simulated using the concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) method. With
   significantly less computational cost than that by full molecular

   their interactions are explicitly modeled. Sub-THz Phonon drag
   coefficients on moving dislocations are predicted using CAC and compared
   with MD and experimental results. During the interactions between
   phonons and dislocations, the local temperature is found to rise due to
   energy dissipation, and dislocations are observed to exhibit ``breathing
   modes{''} in which the separation between leading and trailing partials
   varies in time in a quasi-periodic fashion. Simulation results show that
   the phonon drag coefficient on dislocation migration increases with
   phonon wave packet magnitudes or sizes but is insensitive to the

Abstract = {{This paper describes a self-sensing technique for a piezoelectrically
   driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible tweezer style end
   effector, suitable for robot assisted MRI guided surgery. Nested strain
   amplification mechanisms are used to amplify the displacement of the
   piezo actuators to practical levels for robotics. By using a hysteretic
   piezoelectric model and a two port network model for the compliant
   nested strain amplifiers, it is shown that force and displacement at the
   tweezer tip can be estimated if the input voltage and charge are
   measured. One piezo unit is used simultaneously as a sensor and an
   actuator, preserving the full actuation capability of the device. An
   on-site calibration procedure is proposed that calibrates the combined
   electromechanical model without requiring specific loading conditions on
   the inner piezoelectric actuators. Experimental validation shows an
   average of 12\% error between the self-sensed and true values.}},

Abstract = {{Shear-dependent viscosities have been measured over a range of
   temperature and pressure for seven engine oils blended to have kinematic
   viscosity of 14 mm(2)/s at 100 degrees C with two base oils and four
   viscosity modifiers. Elevated pressure measurements were performed with
   a pressurized thin-film Couette viscometer and ambient pressure
   measurements were done with a PCS USV viscometer. These measurements
   were fitted to a generalized Newtonian model with the effective shear
   modulus specified by an empirical power-law shifting rule. The use of
   PAO-40 as a thickener delayed the shear-thinning to very high stress as
   compared with the polymers. The rate sensitivity of the oils thickened
   with nondispersant polymers was similar. Like the Tannas TBS viscometer,
   the PCS Instruments USV viscometer provides shear-dependent viscosity
   measurements, which can be essential for the most accurate
   time-temperature-pressure shifting. Viscosities measured at high viscous
   power in the ambient pressure viscometer, however, tend to be influenced
   by thermal softening and at high stress by shear cavitation.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Energy-related geosystems often impose extreme temperatures and loading
   conditions on the surrounding medium, so granular materials must be
   selected or engineered to satisfy heat transfer requirements and
   mechanical stability. In this work, the thermo-mechanical response of
   some natural and engineered granular materials was investigated by
   subjecting dense specimens to vertical load under zero lateral strain
   boundary conditions with concurrent thermal conductivity measurements.
   The materials studied were quartzitic sand with and without metal
   coatings, fly ash, diatomaceous earth, ceramic microspheres and hollow
   glass microspheres. Dry and densely packed hollow glass microspheres,
   ceramic microspheres and naturally occurring diatomaceous earth were
   found to be more compressible than sands, but exhibited very low thermal
   conductivity and very low stress-dependent gain in thermal conductivity.
   At the other extreme, dense sands combined the high thermal conductivity
   of quartz with the benefits of metal coatings to render the highest
   thermal conductivity values among the tested materials; while
   mechanically stable, dense sands were found to experience pronounced
   changes in thermal conductivity with stress. Analytical predictions show
   that saturation with high thermal conductivity liquids will enhance the
   effective thermal conductivity of granular materials more than the
   changes attained with metal coatings. Interparticle heat conduction
   processes and contact resistance explain the measured conductivity
   values obtained with the granular materials tested in this study.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{79-85}},

Abstract = {{The CO2 adsorption performance of aminosilica adsorbents prepared by the
   impregnation of poly(allylamine) (PAA) and guanidinylated
   poly(allylamine) (GPAA) into silica mesocellular foam supports is
   evaluated. The effect of amine loading on the CO2 capacity is consistent
   with previous reports of poly(allylamine) impregnated adsorbents,
   whereby the capacity increases initially with increasing amine loading
   and then drops at very high amine loadings, due to restricted access to
   the amine sites at high loadings. The CO2 capacity of the new GPAA
   impregnated adsorbents decreases with an increase in adsorption
   temperature, showing comparable capacities to those for PAA impregnated
   adsorbents at low to moderate temperatures. However, at adsorption
   temperature higher than 75 degrees C, the CO2 capacities of GPAA
   adsorbents are higher than those for PAA adsorbents, similar to 70\%
   higher at the highest temperature studied, 140 degrees C. CO2
   adsorption-desorption cycling experiments show that the GPAA adsorbents
   have a better stability and regenerability at higher temperatures,
   making this class of materials suited for temperature swing cycles
   operating in a higher temperature regime than traditional aminosilica
   adsorbents based on PEI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature-dependent crystal viscoplasticity models are ideal for
   modeling largegrained, directionally solidified Ni-base superalloys but
   are computationally expensive. This work explores the use of
   reduced-order models that are potentially more efficient with similar
   predictive capability of capturing temperature and orientation
   dependence. First, a transversely isotropic viscoplasticity model is
   calibrated to a directionally solidified Ni-base superalloy using the
   response predicted by a crystal viscoplasticity model. The unified
   macroscale model is capable of capturing isothermal and thermomechanical
   responses in addition to secondary creep behavior over the temperature
   range of 20-1050 degrees C. A second approach is an extreme
   reduced-order microstructure-sensitive constitutive model that uses an
   artificial neural network to provide a set of parameters that depend on
   orientation, temperature, and strain rate to give a first-order
   approximation of the material response using a simple constitutive
   model. This simple relationship is then used in a Neuber-type fatigue
   notch analysis to predict the local response.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets as an over-coating layer on
   silver nanoparticles (rGO/AgNPs) and silver nanowires (rGO/AgNWs) have
   been fabricated using solution processes and tested for NH3 gas
   detection in nitrogen/air at room temperature (RT). When exposed to 100
   ppm NH3, the rGO/AgNWs device exhibited an excellent sensitivity (15\%)
   compared to the rGO/AgNPs, rGO, and AgNWs devices. Our results revealed
   that the underneath AgNWs play a role as a network for providing a
   carrier transfer pathway, thus the rGO/AgNWs gas sensor device showed a
   stable, reproducible response and full recovery in nitrogen at RT.
   However, an excess amount of the AgNWs resulted in the agglomeration of
   the AgNWs. Consequently, a defective rGO over-coating layer with
   appearance of the pits was formed, reducing the sensitivity due to the
   adsorption deficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using network theory to explore the complexity of subway construction
   accident network (SCAN) for promoting safety management}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Accident case analysis has been widely adopted to promote construction
   safety. Learning from past accidents is effective to avoid similar
   dangerous situations or accidents. An accident is often the result of a
   sequence of previous accidents, or the cause of the next accidents.
   There is an accident chain or network in practice. Instead of analyzing
   a single accident, this study uses network theory to explore the
   complexity of the subway construction accident network (SCAN). Pajek was
   employed to identify SCAN and analyze corresponding topological
   characteristics. As a result, an unweighted directed network with 26
   vertices and 49 edges was obtained. Five parameters were calculated for
   better capturing the structure of SCAN. The cumulative degree
   distribution obeys power-law distribution. This indicates that SCAN is
   resilience to random attacks. If some high-degree vertices are attacked
   at the same instant, SCAN is turned to be vulnerable and isolated. The
   characteristics of big clustering coefficient and short average path
   length denote that SCAN is a small-world network. This type of network
   demonstrates faster accident propagation than regular networks. Almost
   60\% of shortest paths contain collapse of soil, struck-by, explosion
   and collapse of machine. Effectively controlling these four types of
   accidents can increase average path length and diameter. As a result,
   accident propagation efficiency can lower, and chain reaction is
   dampened in this accident network. Topological parameters analysis is
   beneficial to understanding the mechanism and capturing the complexity
   of SCAN. It is helpful to restraint original accidents, and prevent
   secondary and derivative accidents, which can assist in improving safety
   management on subway construction sites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Concerns over the safety and high cost of lithium ion batteries,
   especially those containing cobalt-based active materials, limit their
   use to applications where energy density requirements cannot be met by
   any other materials. Manganese-spinel based positive electrode materials
   represent a promising candidate for lithium ion batteries because of
   their lower cost, lower toxicity, and greater resistance to thermal
   runaway than cobalt-based active materials. Although LiMn2O4 has a
   well-known issue of capacity fading, investigations into nanostructured
   composites composed of surface modified spinel phases have demonstrated
   outstanding performance, suggesting that LiMn2O4 has potential to be a
   viable positive electrode for safe, inexpensive, high power, and long
   lifetime lithium-ion batteries. Here we report a low-temperature
   hydrothermal process for growth of conformal coatings of highly
   crystalline LiMn2O4 directly onto a carbon fiber current collector,
   completely eliminating the process steps and materials associated with
   the conventional tape casting approach (binders, solvents, and metal
   foils). The prepared electrodes tested at a rate of 1 C showed an
   initial discharge capacity of 125 mAh g(-1) and an average energy
   efficiency of 92.4\% over 100 cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Little is known about the optical significance of light absorbing
   particulate organic compounds (i.e., brown carbon, BrC), including the
   importance relative to black carbon (BC) and influence on direct
   radiative forcing by aerosols. The vertical profile of BrC affects its
   radiative forcing, yet the distribution of BrC in the free troposphere
   is largely unknown. In this study, BrC absorption was directly measured
   in solvent extracts of particulate filters obtained from aircraft
   sampling over the continental USA. Excluding biomass burning plumes, BrC
   was observed throughout the tropospheric column (<13km), and its
   prevalence increased relative to BC with increasing altitude, indicating
   contributions from secondary sources. Closure analysis showed good
   agreement between light absorption from BC plus BrC relative to measured
   total aerosol absorption. A radiative transfer model indicated that BrC
   absorption reduced top of atmosphere aerosol forcing by similar to 20\%,
   suggesting that it is an important component of direct aerosol radiative
   forcing.

Abstract = {{Coupled-cluster theory including single, double, and perturbative triple
   excitations {[} CCSD(T)] has been applied to trimers that appear in
   crystalline benzene in order to resolve discrepancies in the literature
   about the magnitude of non-additive three-body contributions to the
   lattice energy. The present results indicate a non-additive three-body
   contribution of 0.89 kcal mol(-1), or 7.2\% of the revised lattice
   energy of -12.3 kcal mol-1. For the trimers for which we were able to
   compute CCSD(T) energies, we obtain a sizeable difference of 0.63 kcal
   mol(-1) between the CCSD(T) and MP2 three-body contributions to the
   lattice energy, confirming that three-body dispersion dominates over
   three-body induction. Taking this difference as an estimate of
   three-body dispersion for the closer trimers, and adding an
   Axilrod-Teller-Muto estimate of 0.13 kcal mol-1 for long-range
   contributions yields an overall value of 0.76 kcal mol-1 for three-body
   dispersion, a significantly smaller value than in several recent

Abstract = {{Influenza vaccines with broad cross-protection are urgently needed to
   prevent an emerging influenza pandemic. A fusion protein of the
   Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5-agonist domains from flagellin and multiple
   repeats of the conserved extracellular domain of the influenza matrix
   protein 2 (M2e) was constructed, purified and evaluated as such a
   vaccine. A painless vaccination method suitable for possible
   self-administration using coated microneedle arrays was investigated for
   skin-targeted delivery of the fusion protein in a mouse model. The
   results demonstrate that microneedle immunization induced strong humoral
   as well as mucosal antibody responses and conferred complete protection
   against homo-and heterosubtypic lethal virus challenges. Protective
   efficacy with microneedles was found to be significantly better than
   that seen with conventional intramuscular injection, and comparable to
   that observed with intranasal immunization. Because of its advantages
   for administration, safety and storage, microneedle delivery of
   M2e-flagellin fusion protein is a promising approach for an easy-to-
   administer universal influenza vaccine. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A low pressure injection molding (LPIM) technique is successfully
   developed to fabricate porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates for cone-shaped
   tubular anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The porosity and
   microstructure of the anode samples prepared with different amount of
   pore formers are investigated through the Archimedes method and SEM
   analysis. Experimental results show that with 15 wt.\% paraffin as
   plasticizer, porosity of the NiO-YSZ substrates sintered at 1400 C is
   proportional to the amount of graphite as pore former, and proper
   porosities can be obtained with or without 5 wt.\% graphite.
   NiO-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ single cells are assembled and tested to demonstrate
   the feasibility of the LPIM technique. At 800 C, with moist hydrogen (75
   ml min(-1)) as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, the cell with the anode
   substrate fabricated with 5 wt.\% pore former shows a maximum power
   density of 531 mW cm(-2), while the cell without any pore former, 491 mW
   cm-2. Two of the single cells (without graphite) are applied to assemble
   a two-cell-stack which gives an open circuit voltage of 1.75 V and a
   maximum output power of 5.32W, at operating temperature of 800 C.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{598}},

Abstract = {{The formation and early growth of fatigue cracks in the high cycle
   fatigue regime is influenced by microstructure features such as grain
   size and morphological and crystallographic texture. However, most
   fatigue models do not predict the influence of the microstructure on
   early stages of crack formation, or they employ parameters that should
   be calibrated with experimental data from specimens with microstructures
   of interest. These post facto strategies are adequate to characterize
   materials, but they are not fully appropriate to aid in the design of
   fatigue-resistant engineering alloys. This paper presents a modeling
   framework that facilitates relative assessment of fatigue resistance
   among different microstructures, including the microstructurally small
   crack growth regime. The scheme employs finite element simulations based
   on crystal plasticity that explicitly render the microstructure and a
   methodology that estimates transgranular growth of microstructurally
   small cracks on a grain-by-grain basis, including consideration of
   growth within grains and stress redistribution as the cracks extend. The
   methodology is implemented in ABAQUS and is calibrated to study fatigue
   crack initiation of a bimodal grain size distribution found in RR1000
   powder processed Ni-base superalloys for aircraft gas turbine disk
   applications. The transition to intergranular failure is also
   considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) star
   polyelectrolytes with dual thermo- and pH-responsive properties have
   been studied by in situ small-angle neutron scattering at different
   temperatures and pH conditions in order to reveal their conformational
   changes in semidilute solution. At pH values close to the pK(a), all
   PDMAEMA stars studied here are partially charged and show a core-shell
   quasi-micellar morphology caused by microphase separation with a
   collapsed core region with high monomer density and a hydrated loosely
   packed shell region. Upon increasing the temperature, the PDMAEMA star
   polyelectrolytes first experience a contraction in the shell region
   while the core size remains almost unchanged, and then start to form
   limited intermolecular aggregates. With decreasing pH values, the
   transition temperature increases and the size of the aggregates
   decreases (average aggregation number changes from 10 to 3). We suggest
   that these changes are triggered by the decrease in solvent quality with
   increasing temperature, which leads to the transition from an
   electrostatically dominated regime to a regime dominated by hydrophobic
   interactions. The observed phenomenon is in striking contrast to the
   phase behavior of linear PDMAEMA polyelectrolytes, which show macrophase
   separation with increasing temperature under the same conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the experimental investigation of two different
   approaches to random bit generation based on the chaotic dynamics of a
   semiconductor laser with optical feedback. By computing high-order
   finite differences of the chaotic laser intensity time series, we obtain
   time series with symmetric statistical distributions that are more
   conducive to ultrafast random bit generation. The first approach is
   guided by informationtheoretic considerations and could potentially
   reach random bit generation rates as high as 160 Gb/s by extracting 4
   bits per sample. The second approach is based on pragmatic
   considerations and could lead to rates of 2.2 Tb/s by extracting 55 bits
   per sample. The randomness of the bit sequences obtained from the two
   approaches is tested against three standard randomness tests (ENT,
   Diehard, and NIST tests), as well as by calculating the statistical bias
   and the serial correlation coefficients on longer sequences of random
   bits than those used in the standard tests.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental understanding of the morphological development of
   cellulose fibers during fibrillation using micro grinder is very
   essential to develop effective strategies for process improvement and to
   reduce energy consumption. We demonstrated some simple measures for
   characterizing cellulose fibers fibrillated at different fibrillation
   times through the grinder. The morphology and degree of fibrillation of
   the samples at different stages of fibrillation were characterized. The
   fibrillation and mechanical properties reached a maximum in 2 h, and did
   not show any significant change with further grinding. The lateral
   dimensions of the smallest nanofibrils were between 15 and 40 nm. A
   slight reduction in the crystallinity and degree of polymerization did
   not lead to decrease in mechanical properties of cellulose films. The
   lower tensile properties at the initial stages of fibrillation are
   mainly due to the presence of limited refined and heterogeneously
   treated fibers.}},

Title = {{Lattice Boltzmann simulations of multiple-droplet interaction dynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{A lattice Boltzmann (LB) formulation, which is consistent with the
   phase-field model for two-phase incompressible fluid, is proposed to
   model the interface dynamics of droplet impingement. The interparticle
   force is derived by comparing the macroscopic transport equations
   recovered from LB equations with the governing equations of the
   continuous phase-field model. The inconsistency between the existing LB
   implementations and the phase-field model in calculating the relaxation
   time at the phase interface is identified and an approximation is
   proposed to ensure the consistency with the phase-field model. It is
   also shown that the commonly used equilibrium velocity boundary for the
   binary fluid LB scheme does not conserve momentum at the wall boundary
   and a modified scheme is developed to ensure the momentum conservation
   at the boundary. In addition, a geometric formulation of the wetting
   boundary condition is proposed to replace the popular surface energy
   formulation and results show that the geometric approach enforces the
   prescribed contact angle better than the surface energy formulation in
   both static and dynamic wetting. The proposed LB formulation is applied
   to simulating droplet impingement dynamics in three dimensions and
   results are compared to those obtained with the continuous phase-field
   model, the LB simulations reported in the literature, and experimental
   data from the literature. The results show that the proposed LB
   simulation approach yields not only a significant speed improvement over
   the phase-field model in simulating droplet impingement dynamics on a
   submillimeter length scale, but also better accuracy than both the
   phase-field model and the previously reported LB techniques when
   compared to experimental data. Upon validation, the proposed LB modeling
   methodology is applied to the study of multiple-droplet impingement and
   interactions in three dimensions, which demonstrates its powerful
   capability of simulating extremely complex interface phenomena.}},

Title = {{A Heuristic Model of Alcohol Dependence}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Substance dependence poses a critical health problem. Sadly,
   its neurobiological mechanisms are still unclear, and this lack of real
   understanding is reflected in insufficient treatment options. It has
   been hypothesized that alcohol effects are due to an imbalance between
   neuroexcitatory and neuroinhibitory amino acids. However, glutamate and
   GABA interact with other neurotransmitters, which form a complicated
   network whose functioning evades intuition and should be investigated
   systemically with methods of biomedical systems analysis.
   Methods and Results: We present a heuristic model of neurotransmitters
   that combines a neurochemical interaction matrix at the biochemical
   level with a mobile describing the balances between pairs of
   neurotransmitters at the physiological and behavioral level. We
   investigate the effects of alcohol on the integrated neurotransmitter
   systems at both levels. The model simulation results are consistent with
   clinical and experimental observations. The model demonstrates that the
   drug diazepam for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal effectively reduces the
   imbalances between neurotransmitters. Moreover, the acetylcholine signal
   is suggested as a novel target for treatment of symptoms associated with
   alcohol withdrawal.
   Conclusions: Efficient means of integrating clinical symptoms across
   multiple levels are still scarce and difficult to establish. We present
   a heuristic model of systemic neurotransmitter functionality that
   permits the assessment of genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological
   perturbations. The model can serve as a tool to represent clinical and
   biological observations and explore various scenarios associated with
   alcohol dependence and its treatments. It also is very well suited for
   educational purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Monoclonal antibodies are the fastest growing class of biotherapeutics.
   Ensuring their colloidal and conformational stability in liquid
   dispersions is crucial for maintaining therapeutic efficacy and economic
   viability. Sugars are often added to increase the colloidal and thermal
   stability of protein; however, determining which sugar is the most
   stabilizing requires time and sample-consuming stability tests. Here we
   show for a human IgG1 that the extent of stabilization by different
   sugars can be gauged by analyzing the proteins' diffusive virial
   coefficient k(D). This protein interaction parameter is measured
   conveniently in a noninvasive, high-throughput manner using dynamic
   light scattering. It is found to correlate closely with experimental
   aggregation rate constants at the onset of aggregation and with melting
   temperatures for antibodies in different sugar solutions. The proposed
   analysis thus provides a rapid test of the subtle differences between
   inherently similar sugar-protein interactions; it should greatly
   facilitate the formulation of protein therapeutics. For the antibody
   investigated in this study, circular dichroism spectroscopy also yields
   clues about the mechanism by which sugars improve the thermal stability.}},

Title = {{An efficient actuating blade model for unsteady rotating system wake
   simulations}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{138-150}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative, efficient actuating blade model to
   capture the unsteady motion of a rotating system within Computational
   Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, with application to wind turbine blades.
   Each blade planform is modeled via a cloud of sources that move
   independently during the simulation to provide rotation of the blade as
   well as optional motion such as blade flexibility (aeroelasticity) and
   active controls (flaps, morphing, adaptive shapes). The model can be
   implemented into structured or unstructured methods that span the gamut
   from full potential to Large Eddy Simulations (LES), and it does not
   require the use of overset grids. A key feature of this model is the
   development of a highly efficient parallelized kd-tree algorithm to
   determine the interactions between actuator sources and grid nodes.
   Computational evaluation of the method successfully demonstrates its
   capability to predict root and tip vortex location and strength compared
   to an overset Navier Stokes methodology on an identical background grid,
   and further improvements in the solution are shown by the use of grid
   adaptation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Observed crest speeds of maximally steep, breaking water waves are much
   slower than expected. Our fully nonlinear computations of unsteadily
   propagating deep water wave groups show that each wave crest approaching
   its maximum height slows down significantly and either breaks at this
   reduced speed, or accelerates forward unbroken. This previously noted
   crest slowdown behavior was validated as generic in our extensive
   laboratory and field observations. It is likely to occur in unsteady
   dispersive nonlinear wave groups in other natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity planning for large-scale high-tech manufacturing processes such
   as semiconductor manufacturing and thin film transistor-liquid crystal
   display (TFT-LCD) using simulation of an entire fabrication facility
   (fab) requires a large computational effort and thus few studies have
   been in real settings. To address the needs of a realistic problem, this
   study aimed to develop an effective approach based on a discrete-event
   simulation model for evaluating the throughput, cycle time and
   utilisation in an integrated fab to integrate manufacturing and
   transportation resources. In particular, we conducted an empirical study
   in a real TFT-LCD fab expansion facing a difficult capacity planning
   problem arising from the expectation that one or more bottlenecks may
   shift to different sites, including the transportation system between
   the incumbent and the expansion fabs. Different product-mix alternatives
   and feeding policies are investigated to determine the best fab
   configuration. The results have shown practical viability of the
   proposed simulation technique to significantly reduce the computational
   effort associated with the capacity planning process and derive useful
   alternatives for supporting capacity expansion decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical stimulation of the outer hair cell hair bundle (HB) is a
   key step in nonlinear cochlear amplification. We show how two-tone
   suppression (TTS), a hallmark of cochlear nonlinearity, can be used as
   an indirect measure of HB stimulation. Using two different nonlinear
   computational models of the cochlea, we investigate the effect of
   altering the mechanical load applied by the tectorial membrane (TM) on
   the outer hair cell HB. In the first model (TM-A model), the TM is
   attached to the spiral limbus (as in wild-type animals); in the second
   model (TM-D model), the TM is detached from the spiral limbus (mimicking
   the cochlea of Otoa(EGFP/EGFP) mutant mice). As in recent experiments,
   model simulations demonstrate that the absence of the TM attachment does
   not preclude cochlear amplification. However, detaching the TM alters
   the mechanical load applied by the TM on the HB at low frequencies and
   therefore affects TTS by low-frequency suppressors. For low-frequency
   suppressors, the suppression threshold obtained with the TM-A model
   corresponds to a constant suppressor displacement on the basilar
   membrane (as in experiments with wild-type animals), whereas it
   corresponds to a constant suppressor velocity with the TM-D model. The
   predictions with the TM-D model could be tested by measuring US on the
   basilar membrane of the Otoa(EGFP/EGFP) mice to improve our
   understanding of the fundamental workings of the cochlea.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-based composites were prepared by the embedding of core-shell
   Al@Al2O3@SiO2 (noted as Al{*}@SiO2) filler particles into a polyimide
   (PI) matrix. The effects of Al{*}@SiO2 filler content (0.1-0.4 volume
   fraction (vf)) on the thermal conductivity, relative permittivity, and
   dielectric loss were then investigated. The obtained Al{*}@SiO2/PI
   composites showed remarkably improved high thermal conductivity and low
   relative permittivity. The maximum thermal conductivity of the
   composites with a 0.4 vf Al{*}@SiO2 filler was 3.1 W/mK, while the
   relative permittivity and dielectric loss were 20.7 and 0.015 at 1 MHz,
   respectively. Compared with pure metal Al particles composites, the use
   of core-shell Al{*}@SiO2 nanocomposites increased composite thermal
   conductivity and reduced composite permittivity. The relative mechanism
   was studied and discussed. This work helps pave the way for the
   identification of proper modifier fillers for polymer matrix
   nanocomposite materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence and removal of thirty representative pharmaceutical and
   personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
   in an urban drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) were investigated for
   a period of one year to evaluate current system's treatment efficacy and
   assess occurrence of PPCPs and EDCs in finished drinking water. Results
   showed that the average total PPCPs and EDCs concentration in the
   surface water source was around 360 ng/L (median concentration = 340
   ng/L) with 57\% coefficient of variation (CV). The median concentrations
   of most of the individual PPCPs and EDCs in the surface water were below
   15 ng/L except for N,N-diethyltoluamide (DEET) and nonylphenol, which
   were at 122 and 83 ng/L, respectively. The compounds DEET, nonylphenol,
   ibuprofen, triclosan, atrazine, tris(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP),
   bisphenol-A, and caffeine (in the order of decreasing median
   concentration) were among twenty compounds detected at least once in the
   surface water, while all of the above detected compounds, except two,
   were also detected in the finished drinking water. The average total
   PPCPs and EDCs concentration in the finished drinking water was around
   98 ng/L (median concentration = 96 ng/L) with 66\% CV. The median
   concentrations of most detected PPCPs and EDCs in drinking water were
   below 5 ng/L except for DEET and nonylphenol, which were at 12 and 20
   ng/L, respectively. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.97) between
   PPCPs and EDCs' concentrations in the source water and in the drinking
   water over the one-year study period when data points from two sampling
   events with unusual removals were excluded. Individual water treatment
   unit processes showed greater temporal variations of PPCPs and EDCs
   removal efficiencies than the overall treatment processes. The removal
   efficiencies also varied greatly among different PPCPs and EDCs. The
   average removal for total PPCPs and EDCs was 76 +/- 18\% at the DWTP,
   with ozonation showing the highest removal efficiency. Based on the
   similar occurrence and removal trends observed as that of total PPCPs
   and EDCs in this study, DEET and nonylphenol can be considered as
   potential indicator compounds for predicting the occurrence and removal
   of total PPCPs and EDCs in surface water. No strong correlations could
   be found between total PPCPs and EDCs removal and the removal of
   suspended solids, turbidity, or organic carbon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We report a facile method for the production of graphene sheets through
   liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents with addition
   of naphthalene. The production yield of graphene is significantly
   increased with the addition of naphthalene in most solvents tested in
   this work. Naphthalene serves as a ``molecular wedge{''} to intercalate
   into the edge of graphite, which plays a key role during sonication and
   significantly improves the production yield of graphene. The graphene
   concentration of the dispersion in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone is as high
   as 0.15 mg/mL (after sonication for 90 min), which allows this method to
   easily produce films and composites for a range of applications. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel PVDF-PZT nanocomposite film has been proposed and used as a
   piezoseparator in self-charging power cells (SCPCs). The structure,
   composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate
   (PZT), provides a high piezoelectric output, because PZT in this
   nanocomposite film can improve the piezopotential compared to the pure
   PVDF film. The SCPC based on this nanocomposite film can be efficiently
   charged up by the mechanical deformation in the absence of an external
   power source. The charge capacity of the PVDF-PZT nanocomposite film
   based SCPC in 240 s is similar to 0.010 mu A h, higher than that of a
   pure PVDF film based SCPC (similar to 0.004 mu A h). This is the first
   demonstration of using PVDF-PZT nanocomposite film as a piezoseparator
   for SCPC, and is an important step for the practical applications of
   SCPC for harvesting and storing mechanical energy.}},

Abstract = {{Given epsilon is an element of {[}0, 1), the epsilon-Relative Error
   Periodic Pattern Problem (REPP) is the following: INPUT: An n-long
   sequence S of numbers s(i) is an element of N in increasing order.
   OUTPUT: The longest epsilon-relative error periodic pattern, i.e., the
   longest subsequence s(i1), s(i2), ... s(ik) of S, for which there exists
   a number p such that the absolute difference between any two consecutive
   numbers in the subsequence is at least p and at most p(1 + epsilon).
   The best known algorithm for this problem has O(n(3)) time complexity.
   This bound is too high for large inputs in practice. In this paper we
   give a new algorithm for finding the longest epsilon-relative error
   periodic pattern (the REPP problem). Our method is based on a
   transformation of the input sequence into a different representation:
   the epsilon-active maximal intervals list L, defined in this paper. We
   show that the transformation of S to the list L can be done efficiently
   (quadratic in n and linear in the size of L) and prove that our
   algorithm is linear in the size of L. This enables us to prove that our
   algorithm works in sub-cubic time on inputs for which the best known
   algorithm works in O(n(3)) time. Moreover, though it may happen that our
   algorithm would still be cubic, it is never worse than the known
   O(n(3))-algorithm and in many situations its complexity is O(n(2)) time.

Abstract = {{We present stacked hollow nanostructures created using electron beam
   lithography (EBL) that act as optical scattering sites with a complex
   combination of local surface plasmon resonances and top-down
   electromagnetic hotspots due to the incorporation of the third dimension
   into their construction. These hollow rectangular gold nanotructures
   with gold caps show a significant red-shift in their main scattering
   peak as compared to the solid structures. Finite-difference time-domain
   modeling shows that the plasmonic response of these structures is
   dominated by higher order plasmonic modes and that the strength of these
   modes is shown to vary according to whether a cap is present. The higher
   order dipolar mode caused by the capped nanostructure results in
   manifold increase in the intensity of the electric field compared to the
   quadrupolar mode from a solid rectangle. This analysis provides
   important information on how complex plasmonic resonances respond to
   structural changes which will be useful in future studies that utilize
   these coupled resonances for detection or light manipulation. In
   addition, the stacking scheme presents a new route for modifying the
   optical response of plasmonic nanostructures through top-down plasmonic
   coupling which may yield plasmon resonance modes not observed in common
   2D nanostructures along with significant increases in the local electric
   fields of these open ``hotspots{''}.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize discrete dipole approximation simulations to provide a
   detailed picture of the scattering behavior of mid-infrared localized
   surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in selectively doped (i.e.,
   i-n(++)-i) Si nanowires. Our simulations, and their quantitative
   comparison to recent experimental results, show that the large
   refractive indices (n approximate to 3-4) of undoped semiconductors in
   the infrared and the anisotropic dielectric environment inherent in the
   nanowire geometry strongly enhance/depress absorption by the
   longitudinal/transverse LSPR. An examination of ``cladding{''} materials
   other than Si (e.g., GaAs, Ge, etc.) reveals that this behavior scales
   with refractive index and that absorption enhancements of at least 35X
   are possible relative to an isotropic vacuum. We also show how
   scattering and absorption contribute to the overall extinction and
   extract a value for the carrier density of Si-based resonators
   synthesized via the vapor liquid solid (VLS) mechanism. Our findings
   establish a framework for rationally engineering LSPR spectral response
   in semiconductor nanowires and highlight the promise of the VLS
   technique for this purpose.}},

Title = {{Muscadine grape skin extract reverts snail-mediated epithelial
   mesenchymal transition via superoxide species in human prostate cancer
   cells}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Background: Snail transcription factor can induce epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT), associated with decreased cell adhesion-associated
   molecules like E-cadherin, increased mesenchymal markers like vimentin,
   leading to increased motility, invasion and metastasis. Muscadine grape
   skin extract (MSKE) has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell
   growth and induce apoptosis without affecting normal prostate epithelial
   cells. We investigated novel molecular mechanisms by which Snail
   promotes EMT in prostate cancer cells via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
   and whether it can be antagonized by MSKE.
   Methods: ARCaP and LNCaP cells overexpressing Snail were utilized to
   examine levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically,
   superoxide, in vitro using Dihydroethidium (DHE) or HydroCy3 dyes.
   Mitosox staining was performed to determine whether the source of ROS
   was mitochondrial in origin. We also investigated the effect of
   Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) on EMT marker expression by western
   blot analysis. Migration and cell viability using MTS proliferation
   assay was performed following MSKE treatments.
   Results: Snail overexpression in ARCaP and LNCaP cells was associated
   with increased concentration of mitochondrial superoxide, in vitro.
   Interestingly, MSKE decreased superoxide levels in ARCaP and LNCaP
   cells. Additionally, MSKE and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) reverted EMT as
   evidenced by decreased vimentin levels and re-induction of E-cadherin
   expression in ARCaP-Snail cells after 3 days, concomitant with reduced
   cell migration. MSKE also decreased Stat-3 activity in ARCaP-Snail
   cells.
   Conclusions: This study shows that superoxide species may play a role in
   Snail transcription factor-mediated EMT. Therefore, therapeutic
   targeting of Snail with various antioxidants such as MSKE may prove
   beneficial in abrogating EMT and ROS-mediated tumor progression in human
   prostate cancer.}},

   parameters without undergoing irreversible damage. When correlated with
   the conditions of environmental exposure, these changes provide new
   insight into the possible physical mechanisms in the presence of oxygen
   and water. Photoexcited charge collection spectroscopy experiments
   provided further evidence of oxygen and water effects on OFETs. Top-gate
   OFETs also display outstanding durability, even when exposed to oxygen
   plasma and subsequent. immersion in water or operated under aqueous

Abstract = {{A phosphonic acid is used as a surface initiator for the growth of
   polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) from barium titanate (BTO)
   nanoparticles through atom transfer radical polymerization with
   activators regenerated by electron transfer. This results in the barium
   titanate cores embedded in the grafted polymer. The one-component
   system, PMMA-grafted-BTO, achieves a maximum extractable energy density
   of 2 J/cm(3) at a field strength of similar to 220 V/mu m, which
   exhibits a 2-fold increase compared to that of the composite without
   covalent attachment or the neat polymer. Such materials have potential
   applications in hybrid capacitors due to the high permittivity of the
   nanoparticles and the high breakdown strength, mechanical flexibility,
   and ease of processability due to the organic polymer. The synthesis,
   processing, characterization, and testing of the materials in capacitors
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first self-powered electronic skin that consists of
   light-emitting diode (LED) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) arrays
   that can be utilized for spatially mapping applied instantaneous-touch
   events and tracking the movement location of the target object by
   recording the electroluminescent signals of the LEDs without external
   power sources. The electret film-based TENG can deliver an open-circuit
   voltage of about - 1070 V, a short-circuit current density of 10
   mA/m(2), and a power density of 288 mW/ m(2) on an external load of 100
   M Omega. The LEDs can be turned on locally when the back surface of the
   active matrix is touched, and the intensity of the emitted light depends
   on the magnitude of the applied local pressure on the device. A
   constructed active matrix of the LED-TENG array (8 x 7 pixels) can
   achieve self-powered, visual, and high-resolution tactile sensing by
   recording the electroluminescent signals from all of the pixels, where
   the active size of each pixel can be decreased to 10 mm(2). This work is
   a significant step forward in self-powered tactile-mapping visualization
   technology, with a wide range of potential applications in touchpad
   technology, personal signatures, smart wallpapers, robotics, and
   safety-monitoring devices.}},

Abstract = {{We report a strategy to complement the galvanic replacement reaction
   between Ag nanocubes and HAuCl4 with co-reduction by ascorbic acid (AA)
   for the formation of Ag-Au hollow nanostructures with greatly enhanced
   SERS activity. Specifically, in the early stage of synthesis, the Ag
   nanocubes are sharpened at corners and edges because of the selective
   deposition of Au and Ag atoms at these sites. In the following steps,
   the pure Ag in the nanocubes is constantly converted into Ag+ ions to
   generate voids owing to the galvanic reaction with HAuCl4, but these
   released Ag+ ions are immediately reduced back to Ag atoms and are
   co-deposited with Au atoms onto the nanocube templates. We observe
   distinctive SERS properties for the Ag-Au hollow nanostructures at
   visible and near-infrared excitation wavelengths. When plasmon damping
   is eliminated by using an excitation wavelength of 785 nm, the SERS
   activity of the Ag-Au hollow nanostructures is 15- and 33-fold stronger
   than those of the original Ag nanocubes and the Ag-Au nanocages prepared
   by galvanic replacement without co-reduction, respectively.
   Additionally, Ag-Au hollow nanostructures embrace considerably improved
   stability in an oxidizing environment such as aqueous H2O2 solution.
   Collectively, our work suggests that the Ag-Au hollow nanostructures
   will find applications in SERS detection and imaging.}},

Abstract = {{A novel structure, delta-doped NaYF4:Yb,Er, has been proposed for

   model and the prepared samples characterized physically by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), energy dispersed spectroscopy (EDS) and optically by
   photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Well-defined doping geometries of

   for the cubic-to-rhombohedral phase transition in Sc1-xTixF3 varies
   linearly with composition (above 100 K), and, at large x, the transition
   is clearly first-order. The rhombohedral phase for each composition

Title = {{Altered Causal Connectivity of Resting State Brain Networks in Amnesic
   MCI}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Most neuroimaging studies of resting state networks in amnesic mild
   cognitive impairment (aMCI) have concentrated on functional connectivity
   (FC) based on instantaneous correlation in a single network. The purpose
   of the current study was to investigate effective connectivity in aMCI
   patients based on Granger causality of four important networks at
   resting state derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data -
   default mode network (DMN), hippocampal cortical memory network (HCMN),
   dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal control network
   (FPCN). Structural and functional MRI data were collected from 16 aMCI
   patients and 16 age, gender-matched healthy controls. Correlation-purged
   Granger causality analysis was used, taking gray matter atrophy as
   covariates, to compare the group difference between aMCI patients and
   healthy controls. We found that the causal connectivity between networks
   in aMCI patients was significantly altered with both increases and
   decreases in the aMCI group as compared to healthy controls. Some
   alterations were significantly correlated with the disease severity as
   measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and California verbal
   learning test (CVLT) scores. When the whole-brain signal averaged over
   the entire brain was used as a nuisance covariate, the within-group maps
   were significantly altered while the between-group difference maps did
   not. These results suggest that the alterations in causal influences may
   be one of the possible underlying substrates of cognitive impairments in
   aMCI. The present study extends and complements previous FC studies and
   demonstrates the coexistence of causal disconnection and compensation in
   aMCI patients, and thus might provide insights into biological mechanism
   of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic examination of the computational expense and accuracy of
   Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) for the prediction of
   non-covalent interaction energies is provided with respect to both
   method {[}SAPT0, DFT-SAPT, SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+ 3; with
   and without CCD dispersion for the last three] and basis set {[}Dunning
   cc-pVDZ through aug-cc-pV5Z wherever computationally tractable,
   including truncations of diffuse basis functions]. To improve accuracy
   for hydrogen-bonded systems, we also include two corrections based on
   exchange-scaling (sSAPT0) and the supermolecular MP2 interaction energy
   (delta MP2). When considering the best error performance relative to
   computational effort, we recommend as the gold, silver, and bronze
   standard of SAPT: SAPT2+(3)delta MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, SAPT2+/aug-cc-pVDZ,

Title = {{Targeting Extracellular DNA to Deliver IGF-1 to the Injured Heart}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{There is a great need for the development of therapeutic strategies that
   can target biomolecules to damaged myocardium. Necrosis of myocardium
   during a myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by extracellular
   release of DNA, which can serve as a potential target for ischemic
   tissue. Hoechst, a histological stain that binds to double-stranded DNA
   can be conjugated to a variety of molecules. Insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1), a small protein/polypeptide with a short
   circulating-half life is cardioprotective following MI but its clinical
   use is limited by poor delivery, as intra-myocardial injections have
   poor retention and chronic systemic presence has adverse side effects.
   Here, we present a novel delivery vehicle for IGF-1, via its conjugation
   to Hoechst for targeting infarcted tissue. Using a mouse model of
   ischemia-reperfusion, we demonstrate that intravenous delivery of
   Hoechst-IGF-1 results in activation of Akt, a downstream target of IGF-1
   and protects from cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction following MI.}},

   the biophysical microtissue niche}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Stem cell fate and function are dynamically modulated by the
   interdependent relationships between biochemical and biophysical signals
   constituting the local 3D microenvironment. While approaches to
   recapitulate the stem cell niche have been explored for directing stem
   cell differentiation, a quantitative relationship between embryonic stem
   cell (ESC) morphogenesis and intrinsic biophysical cues within
   three-dimensional microtissues has not been established. In this study,
   we demonstrate that mesenchymal embryonic microtissues induced by BMP4
   exhibited increased stiffness and viscosity accompanying
   differentiation, with cytoskeletal tension significantly contributing to
   multicellular stiffness. Perturbation of the cytoskeleton during ESC
   differentiation led to modulation of the biomechanical and gene
   expression profiles, with the resulting cell phenotype and biophysical
   properties being highly correlated by multivariate analyses. Together,
   this study elucidates the dynamics of biophysical and biochemical
   signatures within embryonic microenvironments, with broad implications
   for monitoring tissue dynamics, modeling pathophysiological and
   embryonic morphogenesis and directing stem cell patterning and
   differentiation.}},

Journal = {{NEURON}},

Abstract = {{It has long been posited that detectability of sensory inputs can be
   sacrificed in favor of improved discriminability and that sensory
   adaptation may mediate this trade-off. The extent to which this
   trade-off exists behaviorally and the complete picture of the underlying
   neural representations that likely subserve the phenomenon remain
   unclear. In the rodent vibrissa system, an ideal observer analysis of
   cortical activity measured using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in
   anesthetized animals was combined with behavioral detection and
   discrimination tasks, thalamic recordings from awake animals, and
   computational modeling to show that spatial discrimination performance
   was improved following adaptation, but at the expense of the ability to
   detect weak stimuli. Together, these results provide direct behavioral
   evidence for the trade-off between detectability and discriminability,
   that this trade-off can be modulated through bottom-up sensory
   adaptation, and that these effects correspond to important changes in
   thalamocortical coding properties.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the development and characterization of a
   thermodenuder for the study and interpretation of aerosol volatility.
   Thermodenuder measurements are further combined with a continuous-flow
   streamwise thermal gradient CCN counter to obtain the corresponding

   characterized with monodisperse aerosol of variable volatility and
   hygroscopicity. The measurements are then interpreted with a
   comprehensive instrument model embedded within an optimization framework
   to retrieve aerosol properties with constrained uncertainty. Special
   attention is given to the interpretation of the size distribution of the
   thermodenuded aerosol, deconvoluting the effects of impurities and
   multiple charging, and to simplifications on the treatment of
   thermodenuder geometry, temperature, the cooling section, and the
   effects of curvature and accommodation coefficient on inferred particle
   volatility. Retrieved vapor pressures are consistent with published

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2697-2705}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of combined
   low-pressure ultraviolet (LPUV) irradiation and free chlorination on the
   formation of trichloronitromethane (TCNM) byproduct from amine
   precursors, including a commonly used polyamine coagulant aid
   (poly(epichlorohydrin dimethylamine)) and simple alkylamines
   dimethylamine (DMA) and methylamine (MA). Results showed that TCNM
   formation can increase up to 15 fold by combined UV/chlorine under
   disinfection to advanced oxidation conditions. The enhancement effect is
   influenced by UV irradiance, chlorine dose, and water pH. Extended
   reaction time leads to the decay of TCNM by direct photolysis. The
   combined UV/chlorine conditions significantly promoted degradation of
   polyamine to generate intermediates, including DMA and MA, which are
   better TCNM precursors than polyamine, and also facilitated
   transformation of these amine precursors to TCNM. Under combined
   UV/chlorine, polyamine degradation was likely promoted by radical
   oxidation, photodecay of chlorinated polyamine, and chlorine
   oxidation/substitution. Promoted TCNM formation from primary amine MA
   was primarily due to radicals' involvement. Promoted TCNM formation from
   secondary amine DMA likely involved a combination of radical oxidation,
   photoenhanced chlorination reactions, and other unknown mechanisms.
   Insights obtained in this study are useful for reducing TCNM formation
   during water treatment when both UV and chlorine will be encountered.}},

Abstract = {{Ionophore antibiotics (IPAs) are polyether compounds used in broiler
   feed to promote growth and control coccidiosis. Most of the ingested
   IPAs are excreted into broiler litter (BL), a mixture of excreta and
   bedding material. BL is considered a major source of IPAs released into
   the environment as BL is commonly used to fertilize agricultural fields.
   This study investigated IPA biodegradation in BL and soil microcosms, as
   a process affecting the fate of IPAs in the environment. The study
   focused on the most widely used IPAs, monensin (MON), Salinomycin (SAL),
   and narasin (NAR). MON was stable in BL microcosms at 24-72\% water
   content (water/wet litter, w/w) and 35-60 degrees C, whereas SAL and NAR
   degraded under certain conditions. Factor analysis was conducted to
   delineate the interaction of water and temperature on SAL and NAR
   degradation in the BL. A major transformation product of SAL and NAR was
   identified. Abiotic reaction(s) were primarily responsible for the
   degradation of MON and SAL in nonfertilized soil microcosms, whereas
   biodegradation contributed significantly in BL-fertilized soil
   microcosms. SAL biotransformation in soil microcosms yielded the same
   product as in the BL microcosms. A new primary biotransformation product
   of MON was identified in soil microcosms. A field study showed that MON
   and SAL were stable during BL stacking, whereas MON degraded after BL
   was applied to grassland. The biotransformation product of MON was also
   detected in the top soil layer where BL was applied.}},

Abstract = {{This article studies logical reconfiguration of reconfigurable
   manufacturing systems (RMS) to minimise production lead times and buffer
   inventory level when the process variations and worker utilisation are
   considered. Since the RMS must be flexible for different job orders, the
   design of RMS requires diagnostic methodology and stream of variations
   (SoV) theory for rapid ramp-up in order to control the process
   variations that might occur as time goes on. The flexibility of the
   manufacturing systems is represented by logical elements of RMS in terms
   of changeable production batch size. The three phases solution is
   proposed by (1) utilising SoV modelling to find the allowable production
   lead times, (2) finding the optimum buffer stock level and production
   capacity at changeable production batch size and (3) finding worker
   routings at optimum worker utilisation. Monte carlo simulation is
   employed at Phase 1 to get the optimum production lead times, Phase 2
   decision is formulated as a stochastic two-stages programming where
   buffer inventory level (first stage decison) has to be established prior
   to changeable production batching at future period and shortest path
   problems (SPP) algorithm is used to find an optimum worker routing at
   Phase 3. A serial inventory production (SIP) is used as an example to
   answer the following research questions: (1) What is the impact of SoV
   on both buffer inventory allocation and worker routings? (2) When is
   logical reconfiguration most beneficial in improving SIP profitability?
   (3) What is the impact of logical reconfiguration on both cost and lead
   time reduction? Three instances are used to investigate the effect of
   logical reconfiguration on the different structure of SIP systems. The
   results and analysis indicate that consideration of SoV is capable of
   increasing the profit, reducing operation lead times and maximising
   worker utilisation. Finally, management decision-making is discussed
   among other concluding remarks.}},

Pages = {{283-300}},

Abstract = {{A recent trend in the layout design of unit-load warehouses is the
   application of layouts without conventional parallel pick aisles and
   straight middle aisles. Two examples for such designs are flying-V and
   fishbone designs for single- and dual-command operations. In this study,
   it is shown that the multi-item order picking problem can be solved in
   polynomial time for both fishbone and flying-V layouts. These two
   designs are compared with the traditional parallel-aisle design under
   the case of multi-item pick lists. Simple heuristics are proposed for
   fishbone layouts that are inspired by those put forward for
   parallel-aisle warehouses and it is experimentally shown that a
   modification of the aisle-by-aisle heuristic produces good results
   compared with other modified S-shape and largest gap heuristics when
   items have uniform demand. Computational experiments are performed in
   order to compare the performances of fishbone and traditional layouts
   under optimal routing and it is shown that a fishbone design can obtain
   improvements of around 20\% over parallel-aisle design in single-command
   operations but can perform as high as around 30\% worse than an
   equivalent parallel-aisle layout as the size of the pick list increases.
   The sensitivity of the results to varying demand skewness levels when
   volume-based storage is applied is tested and it is shown that unlike
   the single- and dual-command cases, a fishbone design performs better
   compared to a traditional design under highly skewed demand as opposed
   to uniform demand.}},

   sufficiently low for collecting electrons in solar cells. With the

   conversion efficiency of 6.3 +/- 0.2\% averaged over 9 devices under 100
   mW/cm(2) AM1.5 illumination, which is comparable to the solar cells
   fabricated on indium-tin oxide glass substrates. In addition, we found
   that ultraviolet light-containing illumination can reduce the work
   function of bare FTO from 4.66 eV to 4.34 eV presumably because of the
   desorption of oxygen trapped in FTO. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Despite advances in systemic osteoporosis therapeutic outcomes,
   management of fragility fractures and implant fixation in osteoporotic
   bone remain difficult clinical challenges. Low initial bone density and
   a prolonged healing response can lead to fracture nonunion and aseptic
   implant loosening. Local treatment strategies could be used to prevent
   fracture, accelerate healing, and increase implant fixation by locally
   stimulating anabolic pathways or inhibiting catabolic pathways. Local
   strategies under investigation include direct drug release from
   injectable materials or implant surface coatings. Common locally
   delivered drugs include bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, and bone
   morphogenetic proteins, yet additional compounds targeting novel
   pathways in bone biology are also being actively explored. Mechanical
   stimulation via low intensity pulsed ultrasound, alone or in combination
   with drug therapy, may also prove effective to promote local bone
   healing and implant fixation within osteoporotic bone.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is an important enzyme with
   multiple functions, in particular the production of cyclodextrins. It is
   also widely applied in baking and carbohydrate glycosylation because it
   participates in various types of catalytic reactions. New applications
   are being found with novel CGTases being isolated from various
   organisms. Heterologous expression is performed for the overproduction
   of CGTases to meet the requirements of these applications. In addition,
   various directed evolution techniques have been applied to modify the
   molecular structure of CGTase for improved performance in industrial
   applications. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the
   heterologous expression and molecular engineering of CGTases. In this
   review, we systematically summarize the heterologous expression
   strategies used for enhancing the production of CGTases. We also outline
   and discuss the molecular engineering approaches used to improve the
   production, secretion, and properties (e.g., product and substrate
   specificity, catalytic efficiency, and thermal stability) of CGTase. (C)

   method is computationally efficient, provides consistent parameter
   estimates, and can easily incorporate price and other product
   attributes. Simulations based on industry hotel data demonstrate the
   superior computational performance of our method over alternative
   estimation methods that are capable of estimating price effects. Because
   most existing revenue management choice-based optimization algorithms do
   not include price as a decision variable, our estimation procedure
   provides the inputs needed for more advanced product portfolio

Abstract = {{This paper describes a systematic method to partition the kinetic energy
   (KE) of a free-wheeling wheelchair. An ultralightweight rigid frame
   wheelchair was instrumented with two axle-mounted encoders and data
   acquisition equipment to accurately measure the velocity of the drive
   wheels. A mathematical model was created combining physical
   specifications and geometry of the wheelchair and its components. Two
   able-bodied subjects propelled the wheelchair over four courses that
   involved straight and turning maneuvers at differing speeds. The KE of
   the wheelchair was divided into three components: translational,
   rotational, and turning energy. This technique was sensitive to the
   changing contributions of the three energy components across maneuvers.
   Translational energy represented the major component of total KE in all
   maneuvers except a zero radius turn in which turning energy was
   dominant. Both translational and rotational energies are directly
   related to wheelchair speed. Partitioning KE offers a useful means of
   investigating the dynamics of a moving wheelchair. The described
   technique permits analysis of KE imparted to the wheelchair during
   maneuvers involving changes in speed and direction, which are most
   representative of mobility in everyday life. This technique can be used
   to study the effort required to maneuver different types and
   configurations of wheelchairs.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Aerospace engineers and analysts tasked with informing system-level
   decisions commonly seek to identify the frontier of Pareto-optimal
   solutions with respect to objectives of interest. For problems in which
   decisions are made over multiple stages or periods, dynamic programming
   can be an efficient and effective method for identifying such a Pareto
   frontier. To employ traditional dynamic programming, however, a single
   objective function must be defined. Aggregation of multiple objectives
   into a single objective using traditional simple additive weighting has
   the limitation of permitting identification of only points on convex
   portions of the Pareto frontier. This can translate into detection of a
   frontier with significant and misleading gaps. This paper proposes a
   theory-motivated aggregation function modification and method to improve
   the ability of dynamic programming procedures to detect concave portions
   of Pareto frontiers in multi-objective, multistage problems. Following a
   theoretical motivation and method definition, a military aircraft route
   planning example is provided to illustrate the method's accuracy and
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) play highly conserved roles in development
   and physiology. Most animal genomes encode multiple ILPs. Here we
   identify mechanisms for how the forty Caenorhabditis elegans ILPs
   coordinate diverse processes, including development, reproduction,
   longevity and several specific stress responses. Our systematic studies
   identify an ILP-based combinatorial code for these phenotypes
   characterized by substantial functional specificity and diversity rather
   than global redundancy. Notably, we show that ILPs regulate each other
   transcriptionally, uncovering an ILP-to-ILP regulatory network that
   underlies the combinatorial phenotypic coding by the ILP family.
   Extensive analyses of genetic interactions among ILPs reveal how their
   signals are integrated. A combined analysis of these functional and
   regulatory ILP interactions identifies local genetic circuits that act
   in parallel and interact by crosstalk, feedback and compensation. This
   organization provides emergent mechanisms for phenotypic specificity and
   graded regulation for the combinatorial phenotypic coding we observe.
   Our findings also provide insights into how large hormonal networks
   regulate diverse traits.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft operational range, the distance an aircraft can travel with a
   fixed quantity of fuel, is an intuitive measure that provides strategic
   and tactical insight to the end user. Currently, there is no rigorously
   defined and derived operational range measure for on-orbit spacecraft
   operations with which to inform strategic decisions and planning. This
   paper illustrates how operational range may be computed in the context
   of orbital motion using optimal control theory and how existing results
   in reachability set computation may be leveraged. The solution method
   presented incidentally solves the free-time minimum-impulse full
   orbit-element transfer problem under J(2) perturbations. The derived
   optimal control policy reproduces known optimal free-time minimum Delta
   nu basis maneuvers. The methodology presented is shown to have the
   capability to exactly capture the minimum-fuel free-time operational
   range volumes, although numerical solution algorithm errors persist. The
   approach is validated using known minimum-fuel optimal maneuvers, and
   numerical examples of on-orbit operational range for low Earth orbits,
   geostationary transfer orbits, and geostationary Earth orbits are given.
   Applications to spacecraft operations are detailed.}},

Abstract = {{Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) processes that automate the
   workflow between a parametric product model and performance simulation
   engines can compress design cycle time, increase design knowledge, and
   yield substantive product quality and performance gains. However, the
   accuracy and cost-effectiveness of an MDO process is highly dependent on
   designers' ability to structure the optimization problem for specific
   challenges, particularly when specifying how building attributes and
   their associated geometry are configured for an optimization process.
   This research fills these gaps in MDO literature by developing a
   computer-aided design (CAD)-centric attribution methodology for
   multidisciplinary optimization environments (CAMMOE). CAMMOE enables
   designers to improve the accuracy of their optimization processes by
   helping them develop and analyze alternative spaces that are of just the
   right size and composition to meet their design intent. The writers
   demonstrate the potential power and generality of CAMMOE to enable
   designers to formulate MDO problems that can be executed efficiently and
   effectively with two industry case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled experiments with dedicated ground-based ELF/VLF (0.3-30 kHz)
   transmitters are invaluable in investigating nonlinear whistler mode
   wave-particle interactions in the Earth's magnetosphere. The most
   productive such experiment operated between 1973 and 1988 near L = 4 at
   Siple Station, Antarctica. A major effort has been undertaken to
   digitize and preserve a significant portion of the historical data set
   from the original magnetic tapes, and we describe here the data set and
   the processing techniques used to remove artifacts introduced during
   recording and playback. We analyze a commonly transmitted diagnostic
   format from 1986 and present statistics on the occurrence and properties
   of amplified ELF/VLF waves received by a ground-based receiver at the
   geomagnetic conjugate location to Siple at Lake Mistissini, Quebec. For
   the interval examined, only 11\% of Siple transmissions are successfully
   received in the conjugate hemisphere with quiet geomagnetic conditions
   being significantly more conducive to successful reception. The total
   growth for the events examined is estimated to be 5-40 dB, and nonlinear
   growth rates are in the range of 20-350 dB/s. The observations show that
   as the nonlinear growth rate increases, the duration of nonlinear growth
   decreases. Significant linear correlation is found between the noise
   floor and the saturation level, with higher noise floors resulting from
   increases in natural magnetospheric emissions. Finally, we find a lack
   of correlation between the nonlinear growth rate and the noise,
   threshold, and saturation levels.}},

Abstract = {{During synapse development, synaptic proteins must be targeted to sites
   of presynaptic release. Directed transport as well as local
   sequestration of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs), membranous
   organelles containing many synaptic proteins, might contribute to this
   process. Using neuron-wide time-lapse microscopy, we studied SVP
   dynamics in the DA9 motor neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans. SVP
   transport was highly dynamic and bi-directional throughout the entire
   neuron, including the dendrite. While SVP trafficking was anterogradely
   biased in axonal segments prior to the synaptic domain, directionality
   of SVP movement was stochastic in the dendrite and distal axon.
   Furthermore, frequency of movement and speed were variable between
   different compartments. These data provide evidence that SVP transport
   is differentially regulated in distinct neuronal domains. It also
   suggests that polarized SVP transport in concert with local vesicle
   capturing is necessary for accurate presynapse formation and
   maintenance. SVP trafficking analysis of two hypomorphs for
   UNC-104/KIF1A in combination with mathematical modeling identified
   directionality of movement, entry of SVPs into the axon as well as
   axonal speeds as the important determinants of steady-state SVP
   distributions. Furthermore, detailed dissection of speed distributions
   for wild-type and unc-104/kif1a mutant animals revealed an unexpected
   role for UNC-104/KIF1A in dendritic SVP trafficking.}},

Abstract = {{Contact electrification is about the charge transfer between the
   surfaces of two materials in a contact-separation process. This effect
   has been widely utilized in particle separation and energy harvesting,
   where the charge transfer is preferred to be maximized. However, this
   effect is always undesirable in some areas such as electronic circuit
   systems due to the damage from the accumulated electrostatic charges.
   Herein, we introduced an approach to purposely manipulate the contact
   electrification process both in polarity and magnitude of the charge
   transfer through an applied electric field between two materials.
   Theoretical modeling and the corresponding experiments for controlling
   the charge transfer between a Pt coated atomic force microscopy tip and
   Parylene film have been demonstrated. The modulation effect of the
   electric field on contact electrification is enhanced for a thinner
   dielectric layer. This work can potentially be utilized to enhance the
   output performance of energy harvesting devices or nullify contact
   electric charge transfer in applications where this effect is
   undesirable.}},

Abstract = {{Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are capable of differentiating
   into all mesoderm-derived cell lineages, including endothelial,
   hematopoietic, and cardiac cell types. Common strategies to direct
   mesoderm differentiation of ESCs rely on exposing the cells to a series
   of biochemical and biophysical cues at different stages of
   differentiation to promote maturation toward specific cell phenotypes.
   Shear forces that mimic cardiovascular physiological forces can evoke a
   myriad of responses in somatic and stem cell populations, and have,
   thus, been studied as a means to direct stem cell differentiation.
   However, elucidating the effects of shear pre-conditioning on the
   subsequent vascular differentiation and morphogenesis of ESCs has yet to
   be examined. In this study, ESC monolayers were subjected to
   physiological shear (5 dyn/cm(2)) or static conditions for 2 days on
   collagen IV-coated substrates before initiating embryoid body (EB)
   differentiation. Immediately after the pre-conditioning period, shear
   pre-conditioned and statically cultured ESCs exhibited similar
   morphologies and largely retained a pluripotent phenotype; however, ESCs
   exposed to fluid shear expressed increased levels of endothelial marker
   genes Flk-1 (similar to 3-fold), VE-cadherin (similar to 3-fold), and
   PECAM (similar to 2-fold), compared with statically cultured ESCs. After
   7 days of EB culture, similar to 70\% of EBs formed from shear
   pre-conditioned ESCs expressed significantly higher levels of
   endothelial marker genes compared with EBs formed from statically
   cultured ESCs. Interestingly, unlike EBs formed from statically cultured
   ESCs, EBs formed from fluid shear stress pre-conditioned ESCs exhibited
   a centrally localized region of VE-cadherin(+) cells that persisted for
   at least 10 days of differentiation. These results demonstrate that
   fluid shear stress pre-conditioning not only promotes ESC endothelial
   gene expression but also subsequently impacts the organization of
   endothelial cells within EBs. Together, these studies highlight a novel
   approach to promote in vitro morphogenesis of developmental vasculogenic
   models and potentially promote pre-vascularization of tissue-engineered
   constructs derived from pluripotent stem cells.}},

Abstract = {{A spherical three-dimensional triboelectric nanogenerator (3D-TENG) with
   a single electrode is designed, consisting of an outer transparent shell
   and an inner polyfluoroalkoxy (PFA) ball. Based on the coupling of
   triboelectric effect and electrostatic effect, the rationally developed
   3D-TENG can effectively scavenge ambient vibration energy in full space
   by working at a hybridization of both the contact-separation mode and
   the sliding mode, resulting in the electron transfer between the Al
   electrode and the ground. By systematically investigating the output
   performance of the device vibrating under different frequencies and
   along different directions, the TENG can deliver a maximal output
   voltage of 57 V, a maximal output current of 2.3 A, and a corresponding
   output power of 128 W on a load of 100 M, which can be used to directly
   drive tens of green light-emitting diodes. Moreover, the TENG is
   utilized to design the self-powered acceleration sensor with detection
   sensitivity of 15.56 V g(-1). This work opens up many potential
   applications of single-electrode based TENGs for ambient vibration
   energy harvesting techniques in full space and the self-powered
   vibration sensor systems.}},

Title = {{The mechanical actions of muscles predict the direction of muscle
   activation during postural perturbations in the cat hindlimb}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Humans and cats respond to balance challenges, delivered via horizontal
   support surface perturbations, with directionally selective muscle
   recruitment and constrained ground reaction forces. It has been
   suggested that this postural strategy arises from an interaction of limb
   biomechanics and proprioceptive networks in the spinal cord. A critical
   experimental validation of this hypothesis is to test the prediction
   that the principal directions of muscular activation oppose the
   directions responding muscles exert their forces on the environment.
   Therefore, our objective was to quantify the endpoint forces of a
   diverse set of cat hindlimb muscles and compare them with the
   directionally sensitive muscle activation patterns generated in the
   intact and decerebrate cat. We hypothesized that muscles are activated
   based on their mechanical advantage. Our primary expectation was that
   the principal direction of muscle activation during postural
   perturbations will be directed oppositely (180 degrees) from the muscle
   endpoint ground reaction force. We found that muscle activation during
   postural perturbations was indeed directed oppositely to the endpoint
   reaction forces of that muscle. These observations indicate that muscle
   recruitment during balance challenges is driven, at least in part, by
   limb architecture. This suggests that sensory sources that provide

Abstract = {{The structure sensitivity of acetylene hydrogenation was studied over
   size-controlled cubic and octahedral Pd nanocrystals (NCs) supported on
   ZnO and SiO2. Acetylene hydrogenation was found to be structure
   sensitive {[}with Pd(111) in octahedra being more active than Pd(100) in
   cubes]. However, the response was found to vary depending on the redox
   properties of the support. The catalytically active and selective
   palladium carbide (PdCx) phase was readily formed on the SiO2-supported
   Pd NCs (much faster on cubes than on octahedra), whereas a markedly less
   active PdZn phase was preferentially formed on the ZnO-supported Pd
   nanocrystals. Here we show that the structure sensitivity of a chemical
   reaction is a complex phenomenon that originates from the reconstruction
   of the active phase in response to the reactive environment, which is
   ultimately determined by the support used.}},

Title = {{Study of Chip-Package Interaction Parameters on Interlayer Dielectric
   Crack Propagation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEVICE AND MATERIALS RELIABILITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-65}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To meet the electrical performance requirements, copper traces with
   ultralow-k (ULK) interlayer dielectric (ILD) materials are used in
   today's semiconductor devices. The dielectric constant (k) of these
   materials is often reduced through the introduction of pores or
   inclusions, and thus, the ULK ILD materials have low fracture strength.
   During flip-chip assembly, thermally induced stresses occurring due to
   the differential displacement between the substrate and the die can
   result either in ILD cracking or in ILD delamination in the vicinity of
   solder bump. Such reliability problems are a cause for concern in
   semiconductor devices. In this paper, we study such dielectric cracking
   through numerical models and experiments and present methods to reduce
   such dielectric cracking. This work uses a finite-element-based
   submodeling approach to study ILD cracking in flip-chip assemblies. The
   developed ``global{''} model accounts for the die, the passivation
   layer, the die pad, the solder bump, the substrate pad, and various
   layers in the substrate, including the trace pattern effective
   directional modulus. The displacement boundary conditions from the
   global model under flip-chip assembly cooling are then applied to a
   ``local model,{''} which accounts for the die with its backend-of-line
   (BEOL) stack details, such as the die pad, the passivation layer, the
   solder bump, the substrate pad, and layers in the substrate. The local
   model focuses on the most critical solder bump, based on global stress
   contours. Next, cohesive cracks are introduced at various locations in
   the ULK layers above the critical solder bump and are allowed to
   propagate under flip-chip assembly reflow thermal conditions. It can be
   seen that the elastic energy available for crack propagation initially
   increases with crack length, but then starts to decay, indicating that
   the ILD cracking is often confined in the vicinity of one bump.
   Furthermore, the results from the models have been compared against
   experimental failure analysis results of 45-nm (C45) devices. It is also
   shown that the models can provide geometry and material guidelines to
   reduce ILD cracking.}},

Abstract = {{The microelectronic packaging field is moving into the third dimension

   this paper, we present a double-sided flip-chip (FC) organic substrate

   disaggregated memory chips on the other side of the package. This design
   allows the controller to interface with the DRAM stack directly through
   the substrate providing the shortest possible interconnect path and thus
   achieving the fastest signaling speed. However, this double-sided FC
   configuration also causes yield, assembly, test, and reliability
   challenges. In order to optimize the assembly process, elastic and
   viscoelastic sequential 3-D finite-element models are developed to
   simulate the package assembly process and are validated experimentally.
   In these simulations, various assembly process sequences are simulated

Abstract = {{A hybrid Navier-Stokes free-wake computational-fluid-dynamics
   methodology, coupled with a multibody dynamics analysis code, has been
   applied to the UH-60A rotor to study the loads developed during a severe
   diving turn maneuver (flight counter 11680) characterized by a mean
   advance ratio of 0.388 and a mean load factor of 1.48. The helicopter
   undergoing flight counter 11680 experiences the most severe pitch-link
   loads and root torsional moments recorded in the NASA/Army UH-60A
   Airloads Program. The feasibility of a quasi-steady loosely coupled
   approach for predicting severe maneuver loads was explored for
   predicting critical aerodynamic and aeroelastic phenomena. The
   structural model is first validated through measured airloads, which
   helps in decoupling the physics of structural dynamics and aerodynamics.
   The blade aeromechanical loads, push-rod loads, and harmonic content of
   blade structural loads for a rotor revolution characterized by peak load
   factor (revolution 12) have been examined in detail. The prediction of
   advancing blade-stall phenomena unique to severe maneuvers and the
   extensive occurrence of stall are examined using contours plots of
   sectional airloads and through comparisons of surface pressure values.}},

Abstract = {{To mitigate aviation CO2 emissions, the International Civil Aviation
   Organization's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection is
   considering an aircraft CO2 emissions certification requirement. This
   paper presents an evaluation of potential CO2 metric systems for their
   suitability as a basis for an aircraft CO2 certification requirement.
   Candidate CO2 metric systems, consisting of a metric, a correlating
   parameter, evaluation conditions, and a notional limit line are assessed
   against a set of key criteria. The metric systems were chosen to reflect
   aircraft fuel consumption, which directly correlates with CO2 emissions
   for a given fuel type. Key criteria were identified to represent
   desirable attributes of the metric system, that is the ability to
   represent fuel efficiency performance improvements, validity across a
   range of aircraft types, correlation with fuel efficiency in actual
   operations, fairness across stakeholders, ease of measurement, and
   robustness against unintended consequences. The analysis showed a metric
   system consisting of a metric based on the inverse of the specific air
   range correlated with the maximum takeoff weight evaluated at 85\% of
   maximum takeoff weight reasonably satisfied the key criteria.}},

Title = {{Assessing variability of evapotranspiration over the Ganga river basin
   using water balance computations}},

Abstract = {{A thorough assessment of evapotranspiration (ET) pervades several
   important issues of the 21(st) century including climate change,
   food-security, land-management, flood and drought prediction, and water
   resources assessment and management. Such a proper assessment is of
   particular importance in the Ganga river basin (GRB) with its backdrop
   of a rapidly increasing population pressure and unregulated use of water
   resources. Spatially averaged ET over the GRB is computed as the
   residual of atmospheric and terrestrial water budget computations using
   a combination of model simulations and satellite and ground-based
   observations. The best estimate of monthly ET is obtained as the monthly
   mean of atmospheric and terrestrial water balance computations for the
   period 1980-2007. The mean monthly average of ET from these various
   estimates is 72.318.8 mm month(-1). Monthly variations of ET peak
   between July and August and reach a minimum in February. For the entire
   study period, the rate of change of ET across the GRB is -11 mm yr(-2)
   (i.e., mm/yr/yr). Alongside a notable influence of the 1997-1998 El
   Nino, results allude to the existence of interim periods during which ET
   trends varied significantly. More specifically, during the period of
   1998-2002, the rate of decline increased to -55.8 mm yr(-2), which is
   almost 5 times the overall trend. Based on the correlation between ET
   and independent estimates of near-surface temperature and soil moisture,
   we can infer that the ET over the GRB is primarily limited by moisture
   availability. The analysis has important potential for use in
   large-scale water budget assessments and intercomparison studies. The
   analysis also emphasizes the importance of synergistic use of
   mutliplatform hydrologic information.

Title = {{A simple derivation for the skin effect in a round wire}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The skin effect in a round wire is an important electromagnetic
   phenomenon with practical consequences; however, it is usually not
   presented in any detail at the undergraduate level but reserved for
   graduate study. The purpose of this paper is to remedy this situation by
   providing a simple derivation for the skin effect in a round wire that
   only requires background usually familiar to these students: Maxwell's
   equations in integral form, integral calculus (specifically integration
   of a power) and some elementary properties of series. Graphical results
   are used to clearly show the current concentrating near the surface as
   the frequency increases and the accompanying increase in the resistance
   and decrease in the inductance of the wire. A brief review of the
   history of the subject shows that several of the scientists familiar to
   students made contributions to our understanding of the skin effect in a
   round wire; they include J C Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh, Lord Kelvin, O
   Heaviside and J J Thomson. The validity of the theory is demonstrated by
   comparing results from the theory with resistances and inductances
   measured by some of the early pioneers of wireless communication.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of user search goals for a query can be very useful in
   improving search engine relevance and user experience. Although the
   research on inferring user goals or intents for text search has received
   much attention, little has been proposed for image search. In this
   paper, we propose to leverage click session information, which indicates
   high correlations among the clicked images in a session in user
   click-through logs, and combine it with the clicked images' visual
   information for inferring user image-search goals. Since the click
   session information can serve as past users' implicit guidance for
   clustering the images, more precise user search goals can be obtained.
   Two strategies are proposed to combine image visual information with the
   click session information. Furthermore, a classification risk based
   approach is also proposed for automatically selecting the optimal number
   of search goals for a query. Experimental results based on a popular
   commercial search engine demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, transportation asset management has focused more on
   pavements and bridges, and less on ancillary assets such as traffic
   signs and guardrails. This paper synthesizes the state of practice of
   ancillary transportation asset management to assess the needs for
   successful implementation of such programs by highlighting data
   collection strategies and costs, data analysis tools, and data use in
   decision making, especially as it relates to asset prioritization and
   quantifying the benefits of ancillary asset management. The paper
   focuses on 10 asset classes selected from a review of literature:
   culverts, earth retaining structures, guardrails, mitigation features,
   pavement markings, sidewalks and curbs, street lighting, traffic
   signals, traffic signs, and utilities and manholes. The findings
   indicate that a number of agencies are making significant efforts to
   manage these assets with a range of asset management policies,
   system/program integration approaches, data collection methods and
   costs, benefit quantification, and asset category prioritization
   approaches. The results highlight the state of practice of managing
   ancillary transportation assets, revealing the dynamic nature of these
   activities as agencies evolve their activities to higher levels of

Abstract = {{Worsening highway congestion is a challenge to megaregional
   competitiveness; changing regional geographies and development location
   decisions, among other factors, demand that public policy responses go
   beyond traditional demand-management approaches. Congestion-pricing has
   been suggested as a remedy. In this paper, the writers analyze the
   outcomes of multiple congestion-pricing approaches for the capital
   megaregion that spans the following five metropolitan planning
   organization regions: (1)Washington (District of Columbia, Maryland, and
   Virginia), (2)Baltimore (Maryland), (3)Wilmington (Delaware),
   (4)Fredericksburg (Virginia), and (5)Frederick (Maryland), in addition
   to counties in the adjoining states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
   West Virginia in the United States. Using a megaregional travel-demand
   model, the writers incorporate different values-of-time (VOTs) for
   travelers under different conditions. However, unlike past approaches,
   the writers' VOT estimates go beyond income categories and include trip
   purposes across a number of scenarios. The writers demonstrate that
   adding the trip purpose to congestion-price determination provides added
   insight both at the megaregional level and for individual subregions.
   The results of this paper show how highway users respond differently and
   (in some cases) in unexpected ways to congestion charges when trips in
   accordance with income and purpose are assigned a unique VOT. The
   findings reported in this paper provide engineers, planners, and
   policymakers with a new analytical approach to measuring traveler
   elasticity to tolls while demonstrating the complexity involved with
   road-pricing mechanisms. The writers conclude with implications for
   adopting this approach and ideas for implementing them in a complex
   institutional setup.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of temperature on the output performance of
   triboelectric generators (TEGs). PTFE film and aluminum foil are used as
   the contact materials for the TEG. A high temperature system and a low
   temperature system were used to conduct measurements of TEG output
   voltage and current from 300 K to 500 K and from 77 K to 300 K,
   respectively. Dependence of output performance on temperature was
   subsequently obtained by statistically analyzing the data as a function
   of temperature. The performance of the TEG is maximized at around 260 K
   and degrades at both higher and lower temperatures. A possible mechanism
   is proposed for explaining the observed phenomenon. Applicability of TEG
   over a wide range of temperature was confirmed, from as low as 77 K to
   as high as 500 K, spanning a range of 423 K. Several LEDs connected in
   series were successfully lit up by TEG as the sole power source at
   temperatures of 77 K, 300 K and 500 K. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Harvesting mechanical energy is an important route in obtaining
   cost-effective, clean and sustainable electric energy. Here we report a
   two-dimensional planar-structured triboelectric generator on the basis
   of contact electrification. The radial arrays of micro-sized sectors on
   the contact surfaces enable a high output power of 1.5W (area power
   density of 19mWcm(-2)) at an efficiency of 24\%. The triboelectric
   generator can effectively harness various ambient motions, including
   light wind, tap water flow and normal body movement. Through a power
   management circuit, a triboelectric-generator-based power-supplying
   system can provide a constant direct-current source for sustainably
   driving and charging commercial electronics, immediately demonstrating
   the feasibility of the triboelectric generator as a practical power
   source. Given exceptional power density, extremely low cost and unique
   applicability resulting from distinctive mechanism and structure, the
   triboelectric generator can be applied not only to self-powered
   electronics but also possibly to power generation at a large scale.}},

Abstract = {{The field electron emission of carbon nanotubes has been heavily studied
   over the past two decades for various applications, such as in display
   technologies, microwave amplifiers, and spacecraft propulsion. However,
   a commercializable lightweight and internally gated electron source has
   yet to be realized. Electrical shorting of the gate to the substrate is
   a common and problematic failure mode for Spindt type carbon nanotube
   electron sources, severely limiting their manufacturability. This work
   explores the novel use of an oxygen plasma etch to reverse this
   shorting. Plasma treatments on CNTs are commonly used to improve FE
   performance, but no work presents the use of a plasma etch to reverse
   shorting. The oxygen plasma etch is shown to be a simple and highly
   effective method to reverse shorting and increase yield of open circuit
   Spindt type CNT electron sources by over 70\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Following the flurry of recent theoretical work on cutting planes from
   two-row mixed integer group relaxations of a linear programming tableau,
   we report on computational tests to evaluate the strength of two-row
   cuts based on lattice-free triangles having more than one integer point
   on one side. A heuristic procedure to generate such triangles (referred
   to in the literature as ``type 2{''} triangles) is presented, and then
   the coefficients of the integer variables are tightened by lifting. To
   test the effectiveness of triangle cuts, we compare the gap closed using
   Gomory mixed integer cuts for one round, the gap closed in one round
   using all the triangle cuts generated by our heuristic, and the gap
   closed by a small number of two-row split cuts. Our tests are carried
   out on randomly generated instances designed to represent different
   problem features by varying the number of integer nonbasic variables,
   bounds, nonnegativity constraints, and density, as well as on the
   classical MIPLIB instances. The outcome of this computational analysis
   is some insight into key characteristics of MIP instances whose presence
   makes two-row triangle cuts computationally effective. In particular, it
   appears to be necessary that the tableau row pairs are dense, and more
   subjectively that the nonbasic continuous variables are ``important.{''}
   Unfortunately these characteristics seem to be rarely present among
   real-life instances, and more specifically the tableau rows of the
   MIPLIB instances are far from dense.}},

Title = {{Manipulability of leader-follower networks with the rigid-link
   approximation}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{695-706}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces the notion of manipulability to mobile,
   multi-agent networks as a tool to analyze the instantaneous
   effectiveness of injecting control inputs at certain, so-called leader
   nodes in the network. Effectiveness is interpreted to characterize how
   the movements of the leader nodes translate into responses among the
   remaining follower nodes. This notion of effectiveness is a function of
   the interaction topologies, the agent configurations, and the particular
   choice of inputs used to influence the network. In fact, classic
   manipulability is an index used in robotics to analyze the singularity
   and efficiency of configurations of robot-arm manipulators. To define
   similar notions for leader follower networks, we use a rigid-link
   approximation of the follower dynamics and, under this assumption, we
   prove that the instantaneous follower velocities can be uniquely
   determined from that of the leaders', which allows us to define a
   meaningful and computable manipulability index for the leader follower
   networks. This paper examines the property of the proposed index in
   simulation and with real mobile robots, and demonstrates how the index
   can be used to find effective interaction topologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traditionally, steroid hormones such as the vitamin D3 metabolites,
   testosterone and dihydrotesterone, and 17 beta-estradiol act through
   cytosolic and nuclear receptors that directly interact with DNA to alter
   gene transcription and regulate cellular development. However, recent
   studies focused on rapid and membrane effects of steroid hormones have
   given invaluable insight into their non-classical mechanisms of action.
   In some cases, the traditional receptors were implicated as acting also
   in the plasma membrane as membrane-associated receptors. However, recent
   data have demonstrated the presence of an alternative splicing variant
   to traditional estrogen receptor a known as ER alpha 36, which is
   present in the plasma membranes of several different cell types
   including several cancer cell types and even in some normal cells
   including cartilage and bone cells. The physiological effects that
   result from the membrane activation of ER alpha 36 may vary from one
   cell type to another, but the mechanism of action appears to use similar
   pathways such as the activation of various protein kinases and
   phospholipases leading to the activation of signaling cascades that
   result in rapid, non-genomic responses. These rapid responses can affect
   cell proliferation and apoptotic signaling, indirectly activate
   downstream genomic signaling through phosphorylation cascades of
   transcription factors, and crosstalk with classical pathways via
   interaction with classical receptors. This review describes the data
   from the last several years and discusses the non-classical, rapid, and
   membrane-associated cellular responses to steroid hormones, particularly
   17 beta-estradiol, through the classical receptors ER alpha and ER beta
   and various non-classical receptors, especially estrogen receptor-alpha
   36 (ER alpha 36). (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 {[}1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3] acts on cells
   via classical steroid hormone receptor-mediated gene transcription and
   by initiating rapid membrane-mediated signaling pathways. Two receptors
   have been implicated to play roles in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 mediated
   rapid signaling, the classical nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) and
   protein disulfide isomerase, family A, member 3 (Pdia3). Long term
   efforts to investigate the roles of these two receptors demonstrated
   thatPdia3 is located in caveolae, where it interacts with phospholipase
   A2 (PLA2) activating protein (PLAA) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) to initiate
   rapid signaling via Ca++/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
   (CaMKII), PLA2, phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), and
   ultimately the ERK1/2 family of mitogen activated protein kinases
   (MAPK). VDR is present on the plasma membrane, and it is required for 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 induced rapid activation of Src. PDIA3+/- mice
   demonstrate an impaired musculoskeletal phenotype. Moreover, our studies
   examining mineralization of pre-osteoblasts in 3D culture have shown the
   physiological importance of Pdia3 and VDR interaction: knockdown of
   Pdia3 or VDR is characterized by impaired mineralization of the

Abstract = {{Experimental studies showed the impact of the electrolyte solvents on
   both the ion transport and the specific capacitance of microporous
   carbons. However, the related structure property relationships remain
   largely unclear and the reported results are inconsistent. The details
   of the interactions of the charged carbon pore walls with electrolyte
   ions and solvent molecules at a subnanometer scale are still largely
   unknown. Here for the first time we utilize in situ small angle neutron
   scattering (SANS) to reveal the electroadsorption of organic electrolyte
   ions in carbon pores of different sizes. A 1 M solution of
   tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEATFB) salt in deuterated
   acetonitrile (d-AN) was used in an activated carbon with the pore size
   distribution similar to that of the carbons used in commercial double
   layer capacitors. In spite of the incomplete wetting of the smallest
   carbon pores by the d-AN, we observed enhanced ion sorption in
   subnanometer pores under the applied potential. Such results suggest the
   visible impact of electrowetting phenomena counterbalancing the high
   energy of the carbon/electrolyte interface in small pores. This behavior
   may explain the characteristic butterfly wing shape of the cyclic
   voltammetry curve that demonstrates higher specific capacitance at
   higher applied potentials, when the smallest pores become more
   accessible to electrolyte. Our study outlines a general methodology for
   studying various organic salts solvent carbon combinations.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a dynamic surface plasmonic modulation based on
   graphene-nanowire (grapheme-NW) hybrid structures in the visible light
   range. A static modulation depth of as high as 0.07 dB/mu m has been
   achieved experimentally. Through careful simulation and systematical
   experimental investigation, we found that the dual-confinement effect of
   charge density and electromagnetic energy around the vicinity of the NW
   will dramatically enhance the light-matter interaction and increase the
   Fermi level shifting, which are the key roles for bringing the optical
   response of the device to the visible range. The carrier concentration
   near the vicinity of a Ag NW is estimated to reach 0.921 x 10(14) cm(-2)
   after applying more than 25 V voltages, which is enough to shift the
   Fermi level for visible light. Furthermore, the modulation behaviors
   near the Dirac point of monolayer graphene and the singularity of
   gap-induced bilayer graphene are investigated. Calculated optical
   conductivity as a function of Fermi level predicts a minimum value near
   the Dirac point, which is consistent with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{As a vastly available energy source in our daily life, acoustic
   vibrations are usually taken as noise pollution with little use as a
   power source. In this work, we have developed a
   triboelectrification-based thin-film nanogenerator for harvesting
   acoustic energy from ambient environment. Structured using a
   polytetrafluoroethylene thin film and a holey aluminum film electrode
   under carefully designed straining conditions, the nanogenerator is
   capable of converting acoustic energy into electric energy via
   triboelectric transduction. With an acoustic sensitivity of 9.54 V Pa-1
   in a pressure range from 70 to 110 dB and a directivity angle of 52
   degrees, the nanogenerator produced a maximum electric power density of
   60.2 mW m(-2), which directly lit 17 commercial light-emitting diodes
   (LEDs). Furthermore, the nanogenerator can also act as a self-powered
   active sensor for automatically detecting the location of an acoustic
   source with an error less than 7 cm. In addition, an array of devices
   with varying resonance frequencies was employed to widen the overall
   bandwidth from 10 to 1700 Hz, so that the nanogenerator was used as a
   superior self-powered microphone for sound recording. Our approach
   presents an adaptable, mobile, and cost-effective technology for
   harvesting acoustic energy from ambient environment, with applications
   in infrastructure monitoring, sensor networks, military surveillance,
   and environmental noise reduction.}},

Title = {{Efficient Intracellular Delivery of Molecules with High Cell Viability
   Using Nanosecond-Pulsed Laser-Activated Carbon Nanoparticles}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Conventional physical and chemical methods that efficiently deliver
   molecules into cells are often associated with low cell viability. In
   this study, we evaluated the cellular effects of carbon nanoparticles
   believed to emit photoacoustic waves due to nanosecond-pulse laser
   activation to test the hypothesis that this method could achieve
   efficient intracellular delivery while maintaining high cell viability.
   Suspensions of DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells, carbon black (CB)
   nanoparticles, and calcein were exposed to 5-9 ns long laser pulses of
   near-infrared (1064 nm wavelength) light and then analyzed by flow
   cytometry for intracellular uptake of calcein and cell viability by
   propidium iodide staining. We found that intracellular uptake increased
   and in some cases saturated at high levels with only small losses in
   cell viability as a result of increasing laser fluence, laser exposure
   time, and as a unifying parameter, the total laser energy. Changing
   interpulse spacing between 0.1 and 10 s intervals showed no significant
   change in bioeffects, suggesting that the effects of each pulse were
   independent when spaced by at least 0.1 s intervals. Pretreatment of CB
   nanoparticles to intense laser exposure followed by mixing with cells
   also had no significant effect on uptake or viability. Similar uptake
   and viability were seen when CB nanoparticles were substituted with
   India ink, when DU145 cells were substituted with H9c2 rat
   cardiomyoblast cells, and when calcein was substituted with
   FITC-dextran. The best laser exposure conditions tested led to 88\% of
   cells with intracellular uptake and close to 100\% viability, indicating
   that nanosecond-pulse laser-activated carbon nanoparticles can achieve
   efficient intracellular delivery while maintaining high cell viability.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchically assembled amphiphilic diblock copolymer micelles were
   exquisitely crafted over large areas by capitalizing on two concurrent

Title = {{Biomass feedstock contracts: Role of land quality and yield variability
   in near term feasibility}},
Journal = {{ENERGY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{67-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the absence of an infrastructure for the harvest, storage and
   purchase of cellulosic biomass, contracting is an important mechanism
   through which biorefineries can ensure adequate feedstock supply. We
   develop an optimization model to assess the economic potential of
   dedicated energy crops when profit-maximizing farmers allocate croplands
   of varying quality toward biomass in response to multi-year contracts.
   We evaluate the economic competitiveness of perennial grasses with
   traditional commodity crops, in a case study of switchgrass production
   in Tennessee. Assuming short-term contracts, we consider the importance
   of payment structure, land quality, energy crop yield and projected
   commodity crop returns on a farmer's decision to accept a contract for
   biomass production. We find that a wholesale contract, in which the
   farmer is guaranteed a price per unit biomass, is most effective on the
   highest quality of land, while a contract in which the farmer is
   guaranteed a price per acre is most effective on lower quality land.
   From the biorefinery perspective, a wholesale contract is most effective
   for short-term contracts while an acreage contract is most effective for
   long-term contracts. Breakeven pricing will only secure feedstock from
   farmers who produce commodity crops with unfavorable price outlooks on
   lower quality land; therefore, the contract price must include a premium
   in order to compete for space in the crop mix. The yield profile of
   energy crops has a significant effect on the terms at which short-term
   contracts will be accepted and land allocated toward feedstock
   production. The extent to which energy crop yields observed in field
   trials can be maintained at commercial scale also has a substantial
   effect on the scale at which farmers would be willing to participate in
   energy crop production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   with an additional resonator with a resonance frequency that is tuned
   substantially higher than the magnetic field excitation frequency. This
   additional resonator enhances the magnetic dipole moment and the
   effective permeability of the power transmitter, owing to a phenomenon
   known as the strong paramagnetic response. Both theoretical calculations
   and experimental results show increased PTE due to amplification of the
   effective permeability. In measurements, the PTE was improved from
   57.8\% to 64.2\% at the nominal distance of 15 cm when the effective
   permeability was 2.6. The power delivered to load was also improved
   significantly, with the same 10 V excitation voltage, from 0.38 to 5.26
   W.}},

Abstract = {{To alleviate the spectrum shortage for sensor networks with tremendous
   sensors, cognitive radio technology enabling multi-hop opportunistic
   networking and concurrent transmissions overlaying the primary system
   suggests an attractive facilitation of large-scale wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs) and machine-to-machine communications. However,
   subsequent significant end-to-end delay in large WSN can prohibit
   practical applications. Leveraging the nature of traffic in sensor
   networks, we develop in-network computation to reduce requisite
   transmissions and to accommodate more concurrent transmissions under a
   given spectrum. Specifically, distributed source coding and broadcasting
   in wireless communication are exploited to build the computational
   framework and the achievable network capacity is examined. Furthermore,
   a greedy networking algorithm is adopted to justify significant
   improvement on end-to-end delay and further statistical QoS guarantee,
   while yielding considerable system throughput gain for practical
   deployment of WSNs. Performance evaluations confirm that we successfully
   demonstrate communication efficiency from in-network computations and
   facilitate a new paradigm for spectrum efficient cognitive radio
   networks, which shall be applicable in general multi-hop wireless
   networks and spectrum-sharing WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of extending the coverage and improving the performance of
   impulse radio ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, this paper focuses on
   developing a novel single differential encoded decode and forward (DF)
   non-cooperative relaying scheme (NCR). To favor simple receiver
   structures, differential noncoherent detection is employed which enables
   effective energy capture without any channel estimation. Putting
   emphasis on the general case of multi-hop relaying, we illustrate an
   original algorithm for the joint power allocation and path selection
   (JPAPS), minimizing an approximate expression of the overall bit error
   rate (BER). In particular, after deriving a closed-form power allocation
   strategy, the optimal path selection is reduced to a shortest path
   problem on a connected graph, which can be solved without any topology
   information with complexity O(N-3), N being the number of available
   relays of the network. An approximate scheme is also presented, which
   reduces the complexity to O(N-2) while showing a negligible performance
   loss, and for benchmarking purposes, an exhaustive-search based
   multi-hop DF cooperative strategy is derived. Simulation results for
   various network setups corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed
   low-complexity JPAPS algorithm, which favorably compares to existing AF
   and DF relaying methods.}},

Abstract = {{Surface roughness and radiation effects on the erosion behavior of a

   propellants. A validated numerical approach that relies on a full
   Navier-Stokes flow solver coupled with a thermochemical ablation model
   is used for the analysis. A modification of the Spalart-Allmaras
   turbulence model is implemented to account for surface roughness. Net
   radiative heat flux is considered in the surface energy balance at the
   nozzle interface. Two different simplified models are used to evaluate
   the integral emissivity of dispersed alumina particles. Individual and
   combined effects of roughness and radiation are analyzed. Surface
   roughness enhances the erosion rate for both metallized and
   nonmetallized propellants noticeably. The radiation influences the
   erosion rate of nonmetallized propellant more than the metallized one,
   mainly due to the different erosion regimes, kinetically controlled for
   the former and diffusion controlled for the latter.}},

Title = {{Ignition Transients in a Scramjet Engine with Air Throttling Part 1:

Abstract = {{Achieving efficient ignition and stable combustion in a high-speed
   environment has long been a serious concern in the development of
   scramjet engines. In the engine startup stage, the low chamber pressure
   and unsettled fuel-air mixing tend to blow off the flame, even if a
   flameholding device such as a cavity is employed. The problem may be
   circumvented by modulating the flow structures in the isolator and
   combustor through air throttling downstream of the flameholder. In
   experiments, compressed air is introduced in a controlled manner into
   the combustor to generate a precombustion shock train in the isolator.
   The resultant increases in the temperature and pressure of the airstream
   in the combustor, along with the decrease in the flow velocity, lead to
   smooth and reliable ignition. The incidentally formed separated flows
   adjacent to the combustor sidewall improve fuel-air mixing as a result
   of enhanced flow distortion and increased residence time. Because
   insufficient reaction heat release often leads to an unstable shock
   train, and exceedingly large heat release may cause severe flow spillage
   or even inlet unstart, dynamic optimization of the throttling operation
   is needed to ensure the creation of flow conditions conducive to
   efficient ignition. The present work establishes an integrated
   theoretical/numerical framework, within which the influences of all
   known effects on the engine ignition transient and flame development are
   studied systematically. Part 1 of the study focuses on nonreacting flow
   development and fuel-air mixing under the influence of air throttling.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic and aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor become more complex
   as advance ratios increase to achieve high-speed forward flight. As the
   rotor blades encounter large regions of cross and reverse flows during
   each revolution, strong variations in the local Mach regime are
   encountered, inducing complex elastic blade deformations. In addition,
   the wake system may remain in the vicinity of the rotor, adding
   complexity to the blade loading. The aeroelastic behaviour of a model
   rotor with advance ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 has been evaluated
   with aerodynamics provided via a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   method. Significant radial blade-vortex interaction can occur at a high
   advance ratio; the advance ratio at which this occurs is dependent on
   the rotor configuration. This condition is accompanied by high vibratory
   loads, peak negative torsion, and peak torsion and in-plane loads. The
   high vibratory loading increases the sensitivity of the trim model, so
   that at some high advance ratios the vibratory loads must be filtered to
   achieve a trimmed state.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) and energy-efficient design have emerged as two
   promising techniques to achieve high spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy
   efficiency (EE), respectively. In this paper, we study energy-efficient
   opportunistic spectrum access strategies for an orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CR network with multiple secondary
   users (SUs). Both worst EE and average EE are considered and optimized
   for different emphases and application scenarios. Since the original
   optimization issues belong to nonconvex integer combinatorial fractional
   program and are essentially NP-hard for an optimal solution, we use
   continuous and convex relaxation to modify the problems for somewhat
   better mathematical tractability. For the relaxed worst-EE-based
   spectrum access problem, we first demonstrate the joint quasiconcavity
   of EE on subchannel and power allocation matrices and then develop a
   framework to find the optimal solution based on efficient root finding
   and convex optimization. We also develop a low-complexity alternative
   for suboptimal solution. The relaxed average-EE-based spectrum access
   problem is still NP-hard and may have many local optima. We first
   transform the problem into an equivalent form and introduce a general
   concave envelope based branch-and-bound (B\&B) approach to find the
   global optimal solution. We then exploit the underlying properties of
   the energy-efficient transmission to speed up the convergence of the
   B\&B approach. Besides, we develop a low-complexity heuristic approach
   to find a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the
   energy-efficient spectrum access strategies significantly boost EE
   compared with the conventional spectral-efficient spectrum access ones
   while the low-complexity suboptimal approaches can well balance the
   performance and complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Data collection is a common operation of Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs), of which the performance can be measured by its achievable
   network capacity. Most existing works studying the network capacity
   issue are based on the unpractical model called deterministic network
   model. In this paper, a more reasonable model, probabilistic network
   model, is considered. For snapshot data collection, we propose a novel
   Cell-based Path Scheduling (CPS) algorithm that achieves capacity of
   Omega(1/5 omega lnn.W) in the sense of the worst case and order-optimal
   capacity in the sense of expectation, where n is the number of sensor
   nodes, omega is a constant, and W is the data transmitting rate. For
   continuous data collection, we propose a Zone-based Pipeline Scheduling
   (ZPS) algorithm. ZPS significantly speeds up the continuous data
   collection process by forming a data transmission pipeline, and achieves
   a capacity gain of N root n/root logn ln n or n/logn ln n times better
   than the optimal capacity of the snapshot data collection scenario in
   order in the sense of the worst case, where N is the number of snapshots
   in a continuous data collection task. The simulation results also
   validate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve network
   capacity compared with the existing works.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop an energy-efficient resource-allocation scheme
   with proportional fairness for downlink multiuser orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with distributed
   antennas. Our aim is to maximize energy efficiency (EE) under the
   constraints of the overall transmit power of each remote access unit
   (RAU), proportional fairness data rates, and bit error rates (BERs).
   Because of the nonconvex nature of the optimization problem, obtaining
   the optimal solution is extremely computationally complex. Therefore, we
   develop a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which separates
   subcarrier allocation and power allocation. For the low-complexity
   algorithm, we first allocate subcarriers by assuming equal power
   distribution. Then, by exploiting the properties of fractional
   programming, we transform the nonconvex optimization problem in
   fractional form into an equivalent optimization problem in subtractive
   form, which includes a tractable solution. Next, an optimal
   energy-efficient power-allocation algorithm is developed to maximize EE
   while maintaining proportional fairness. Through computer simulation, we
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm
   and illustrate the fundamental tradeoff between energy- and
   spectral-efficient transmission designs.}},

Abstract = {{A new anisotropic damage model for rock is formulated and discussed.
   Flow rules are derived with the energy release rate conjugate to damage,

   adapted to make the damage threshold depend on damage energy release
   rate and to distinguish between tension and compression strength.
   Positivity of dissipation is ensured by using a nonassociate flow rule
   for damage, while nonelastic deformation due to damage is computed by an
   associate flow rule. Simulations show that the model meets thermodynamic
   requirements, follows a rigorous formulation, and predicts expected

Abstract = {{Total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) geometries have great variability.
   Geometric features, such as diameter, connection angle, and distance

   geometric characteristics that can influence TCPC hemodynamics.
   Anatomies from 108 consecutive patients were reconstructed from cardiac
   magnetic resonance (CMR) images and analyzed for their geometric
   features. Vessel flow rates were computed from phase contrast CMR.
   Computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out to quantify
   the indexed power loss and hepatic flow distribution. TCPC indexed power
   loss correlated inversely with minimum Fontan pathway (FP), left
   pulmonary artery, and right pulmonary artery diameters. Cardiac index
   correlated with minimum FP diameter and superior vena cava (SVC)
   minimum/maximum diameter ratio. Hepatic flow distribution correlated
   with caval offset, pulmonary flow distribution, and the angle between FP
   and SVC. These correlations can have important implications for future
   connection design and patient follow-up. (C) 2014 by the American

Abstract = {{A new solution technique is derived for the time-dependent transport
   equation. This approach extends the steady-state coarse-mesh transport
   method that is based on global-local decompositions of large (i.e.,
   full-core) neutron transport problems. The new method is based on
   polynomial expansions of the space, angle, and time variables in a
   response-based formulation of the transport equation. The local problem
   (coarse-mesh) solutions, which are entirely decoupled from each other,
   are characterized by space-, angle-, and time-dependent response
   functions. These response functions are, in turn, used to couple an
   arbitrary sequence of local problems to form the solution of a much
   larger global problem. In the current work, the local problem (response
   function) computations are performed using the Monte Carlo method, while
   the global (coupling) problem is solved deterministically. The spatial
   coupling is performed by orthogonal polynomial expansions of the partial
   currents on the local problem surfaces, and similarly, the
   time-dependent response of the system (i.e., the time-varying flux) is
   computed by convolving the time-dependent surface partial currents and
   time-dependent volumetric sources against precomputed time-dependent
   response kernels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new spatial homogenization method in transport theory
   is developed that reproduces the heterogeneous solution by using
   conventional flux-weighted homogenized cross sections. By introducing an
   additional source term via an auxiliary cross section, the resulting
   homogeneous transport equation becomes consistent with the heterogeneous
   equation, enabling easy implementation into existing solution
   methods/codes. This new method utilizes on-the-fly rehomogenization,
   performed at the assembly level, to correct for the effect of core
   environment on the homogenized cross sections. The method is derived in
   general geometry and continuous energy and implemented and tested in
   fine-group one-dimensional slab geometries typical of boiling water
   reactor and gas-cooled reactor cores. The test problems include two
   single-assembly and four-core configurations.}},

Title = {{Reduced Graphene Oxide Thin Films as Ultrabarriers for Organic
   Electronics}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Encapsulation of electronic devices based on organic materials that are
   prone to degradation even under normal atmospheric conditions with
   hermetic barriers is crucial for increasing their lifetime. A challenge
   is to develop ultrabarriers that are impermeable, flexible, and
   preferably transparent. Another important requirement is that they must
   be compatible with organic electronics fabrication schemes (i.e., must
   be solution processable, deposited at room temperature and be chemically
   inert). Here, a lifetime increase of 1300 h for poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) films encapsulated by uniform and continuous thin (approximate to
   10 nm) films of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is reported. This level of
   protection against oxygen/water vapor diffusion is substantially better
   than conventional polymeric barriers such as Cytop, which degrades after
   only 350 h despite being 400 nm thick. Analysis using atomic force
   microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy suggest that the superior oxygen
   gas/moisture barrier property of rGO is due to the close interlayer
   distance packing and absence of pinholes within the impermeable sheets.
   These material properties can be correlated to the enhanced lag time of
   500 h. The results provide new insight for the design of
   high-performance and solution-processable transparent ultrabarriers for
   a wide range of encapsulation applications.}},

Title = {{Micro Particle Image Velocimetry Measurements of Steady Diastolic
   Leakage Flow in the Hinge of a St. Jude Medical (R) Regent (TM)
   Mechanical Heart Valve}},

Abstract = {{A number of clinical, in vitro and computational studies have shown the
   potential for thromboembolic complications in bileaflet mechanical heart
   valves (BMHV), primarily due to the complex and unsteady flows in the
   valve hinges. These studies have focused on quantitative and qualitative
   parameters such as velocity magnitude, turbulent shear stresses, vortex
   formation, and platelet activation to identify potential for blood
   damage. However, experimental characterization of the whole flow fields
   within the valve hinges has not yet been conducted. This information can
   be utilized to investigate instantaneous damage to blood elements and
   also to validate numerical studies focusing on the hinge's complex fluid
   dynamics. The objective of this study was therefore to develop a
   high-resolution imaging system to characterize the flow fields and
   global velocity maps in a BMHV hinge. In this study, the steady leakage
   hinge flow fields representing the diastolic phase during the cardiac
   cycle in a 23 mm St. Jude Medical regent BMHV in the aortic position
   were characterized using a two-dimensional micro particle image
   velocimetry system. Diastolic flow was simulated by imposing a static
   pressure head on the aortic side. Under these conditions, a reverse flow
   jet from the aortic to the ventricular side was observed with velocities
   in the range of 1.47-3.24 m/s, whereas low flow regions were observed on
   the ventricular side of the hinge with viscous shear stress magnitude up
   to 60 N/m(2). High velocities and viscous shearing may be associated
   with platelet activation and hemolysis, while low flow zones can cause
   thrombosis due to increased residence time in the hinge. Overall, this
   study provides a high spatial resolution experimental technique to map
   the fluid velocity in the BMHV hinge, which can be extended to
   investigate micron-scale flow domains in various prosthetic devices
   under different hemodynamic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Determining the fraction of the diversity within a microbial
   community sampled and the amount of sequencing required to cover the
   total diversity represent challenging issues for metagenomics studies.
   Owing to these limitations, central ecological questions with respect to
   the global distribution of microbes and the functional diversity of
   their communities cannot be robustly assessed.
   Results: We introduce Nonpareil, a method to estimate and project
   coverage in metagenomes. Nonpareil does not rely on high-quality
   assemblies, operational taxonomic unit calling or comprehensive
   reference databases; thus, it is broadly applicable to metagenomic
   studies. Application of Nonpareil on available metagenomic datasets
   provided estimates on the relative complexity of soil, freshwater and
   human microbiome communities, and suggested that similar to 200Gb of
   sequencing data are required for 95\% abundance-weighted average
   coverage of the soil communities analyzed.}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Depth-resolved three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of
   fluorophore-tagged inclusions in fluorescence tomography (FT) poses a
   highly ill-conditioned problem as depth information must be extracted
   from boundary data. Due to the ill-posed nature of the FT inverse
   problem, noise and errors in the data can severely impair the accuracy
   of the 3D reconstructions. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the FT
   data strongly affects the quality of the reconstructions. Additionally,
   in FT scenarios where the fluorescent signal is weak, data acquisition
   requires lengthy integration times that result in excessive FT scan
   periods. Enhancing the SNR of FT data contributes to the robustness of
   the 3D reconstructions as well as the speed of FT scans. A major
   deciding factor in the SNR of the FT data is the power of the radiation
   illuminating the subject to excite the administered fluorescent
   reagents. In existing single-point illumination FT systems, the source
   power level is limited by the skin maximum radiation exposure levels. In
   this paper, we introduce and study the performance of a multiplexed
   fluorescence tomography system with orders-of-magnitude enhanced data
   SNR over existing systems. The proposed system allows for multi-point
   illumination of the subject without jeopardizing the information content
   of the FT measurements and results in highly robust reconstructions of
   fluorescent inclusions from noisy FT data. Improvements offered by the
   proposed system are validated by numerical and experimental studies. (C)

Abstract = {{What you watch and when you watch say a lot about you, and such
   information at the aggregated level across a user population obviously
   provides significant insights for social and commercial applications. In
   this paper, we propose a model for inferring household structures based
   on analyzing users' viewing behaviors in Internet Protocol Television
   (IPTV) systems. We emphasize extracting features of viewing behaviors
   based on the dynamic of watching time and TV programs and training a
   classifier for inferring household structures according to the features.
   In the training phase, instead of merely using the limited labeled
   samples, we apply semisupervised learning strategy to obtain a
   graph-based model for classifying household structures from users'
   features. We test the proposed model on China Telecom IPTV data and
   demonstrate its utility in census research and system simulation. The
   demographic characteristics inferred by our approach match well with the
   population census data of Shanghai, and the inference of household
   structures of IPTV users gives encouraging results compared with the
   ground truth obtained by surveys, which opens the door for leveraging
   IPTV viewing data as a complementary way for time-and resource-consuming
   census tracking. On the other hand, the proposed model can also
   synthesize trace data for the simulations of IPTV systems, which
   provides us with a new strategy for system simulation.}},

Abstract = {{A technique is presented to prevent timing errors under transient noise
   by borrowing time over multiple stages and by compensating once by
   delaying the clock gating over multiple cycles from the time-borrowing

   noise tolerance with a performance penalty. The constraint that is
   associated with the control delay from the time-borrowing detection to
   the clock-gating circuit is also relaxed to n cycles. The technique is
   referred to as the programmable time borrowing (PTB) technique, as time
   borrowing is performed over a programmable number of stages. A test chip
   with a five-stage pipeline employing the PTB is designed in the 130-nm
   CMOS technology, and the measurement results demonstrate improved noise

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate opportunistic transmission based on signal
   alignment for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) cognitive radio (CR) systems,
   where both primary and secondary users have multiple antennas. In the
   studied scenario, primary users are transmitting based on OFDM and
   secondary users generate interference-free transmission to the primary
   users by using both the spatial and frequency space leftover by the
   primary system. Moreover, inter-and intra-interference among secondary
   users are considered as well. The number of symbols that can be
   transmitted by each secondary user satisfying all interference-free
   constraints is obtained. Precoding matrix design will be discussed for
   perfectly-and partially-aligned transmission. Two chordal-distance based
   schemes, called as exhaustive search algorithm and heuristic algorithm,
   will be developed for each case. Compared to the traditional
   time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme, the proposed scheme can
   support more interference-free symbols to be transmitted by secondary
   users simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Previous clinical, in vitro experimental and in silico simulation
   studies have shown the complex dynamics of flow through prosthetic heart
   valves. In the case of bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs),
   complex flow phenomena are observed due to the presence of two rigid
   leaflets. A numerical method for this type of study must be able to
   accurately simulate pulsatile flow through BMHVs with the inclusion of
   leaflet motion and high-Reynolds-number flow modelling. Consequently,
   this study aims at validating a numerical method that captures the flow
   dynamics for pulsatile flow through a BMHV. A 23 mm St. Jude Medical
   (SJM) Regent (TM) valve is selected for use in both the experiments and
   numerical simulations. The entropic lattice-Boltzmann method is used to
   simulate pulsatile flow through the valve with the inclusion of reverse
   leakage flow, while prescribing the flowrate and leaflet motion from
   experimental data. The numerical simulations are compared against
   experimental digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) results from a
   previous study for validation. The numerical method is shown to match
   well with the experimental results quantitatively as well as
   qualitatively. Simulations are performed with efficient parallel
   processing at very high spatiotemporal resolution that can capture the
   finest details in the pulsatile BMHV flow field. This study validates
   the lattice-Boltzmann method as suitable for simulating pulsatile,
   high-Reynolds-number flows through prosthetic devices for use in future
   research.}},

Title = {{X-ray scatter correction in breast tomosynthesis with a precomputed
   scatter map library}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and evaluate the impact on lesion conspicuity of a
   software-based x-ray scatter correction algorithm for digital breast
   tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging into which a precomputed library of x-ray
   scatter maps is incorporated.
   Methods: A previously developed model of compressed breast shapes
   undergoing mammography based on principal component analysis (PCA) was
   used to assemble 540 simulated breast volumes, of different shapes and
   sizes, undergoing DBT. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was used to
   generate the cranio-caudal (CC) view DBT x-ray scatter maps of these
   volumes, which were then assembled into a library. This library was
   incorporated into a previously developed software-based x-ray scatter
   correction, and the performance of this improved algorithm was evaluated
   with an observer study of 40 patient cases previously classified as
   BI-RADS (R) R 4 or 5, evenly divided between mass and microcalcification
   cases. Observers were presented with both the original images and the
   scatter corrected (SC) images side by side and asked to indicate their
   preference, on a scale from -5 to + 5, in terms of lesion conspicuity
   and quality of diagnostic features. Scores were normalized such that a
   negative score indicates a preference for the original images, and a
   positive score indicates a preference for the SC images.
   Results: The scatter map library removes the time-intensive MC
   simulation from the application of the scatter correction algorithm.
   While only one in four observers preferred the SC DBT images as a whole
   (combined mean score = 0.169 +/- 0.37, p > 0.39), all observers
   exhibited a preference for the SC images when the lesion examined was a
   mass (1.06 +/- 0.45, p < 0.0001). When the lesion examined consisted of
   microcalcification clusters, the observers exhibited a preference for
   the uncorrected images (-0.725 +/- 0.51, p < 0.009).
   Conclusions: The incorporation of the x-ray scatter map library into the
   scatter correction algorithm improves the efficiency of the algorithm.
   The observer study presented here is also the first test of the scatter
   correction algorithm with patient images and human observers, and
   demonstrates its potential to improve the clinical performance of DBT.

Title = {{The deformation and mixing of several Ni/Al powders under shock wave
   loading: effects of initial configuration}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The shock wave initiation of ultra-fast chemical reactions in inorganic
   powder mixtures requires the reactants to be blended within the shock
   front or shortly behind it. As such, the details of particle deformation
   are crucial to understanding the sequence of events leading up to the
   shock initiation of these systems. It is known that the initial
   configuration of a powder (i.e. the mixture composition and particle
   morphology) can have a significant effect on the degree of mixing that
   is achieved under shock wave loading. However, it is difficult to fully
   resolve this mixing behaviour in shock compression experiments due to
   the time and length scales involved. In this work, the shock wave
   deformation and mixing of six distinct Ni/Al powders are studied at the
   particle level using finite element simulation. Attention is focused on
   the Ni/Al interfaces that are formed since overall mixture reactivity
   depends on the specific amount of reactant interfacial area and on
   conditions induced at those interfaces. The analysis reveals (i) a rank
   ordering of the powders based on reactant interfacial area formation,
   (ii) a scaling relation for the rate of Ni/Al interface production and
   (iii) the distributed nature of Ni/Al interface temperature and
   dislocation density over a range of shock stress. Finally, it is shown
   that particle velocity differentials tend to develop across Ni/Al
   interfaces when the compacted powders are reshocked by reflection waves.
   The velocity differentials stem from the heterogeneity of the aggregates
   and are hypothesized to drive fragmentation processes that enable
   ultra-fast reactions on a sub-microsecond time scale.}},

Abstract = {{Growing market demand for portable energy storage has triggered
   significant research on high-capacity lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery
   anodes. Various elements have been utilized in innovative structures to
   enable these anodes, which can potentially increase the energy density
   and decrease the cost of Li-ion batteries. In this review, electrode and
   material parameters are considered in anode fabrication. The periodic
   table is then used to explore how the choice of anode material affects
   rate performance, cycle stability, Li-ion insertion/extraction
   potentials, voltage hysteresis, volumetric and specific capacities, and
   other critical parameters. Silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and tin (Sn)
   anodes receive more attention in literature and in this review, but
   other elements, such as antimony (Sb), lead (Pb), magnesium (Mg),
   aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), bismuth (Bi),
   and zinc (Zn) are also discussed. Among conversion anodes focus is
   placed on oxides, nitrides, phosphides, and hydrides. Nanostructured
   carbon (C) receives separate consideration. Issues in high- capacity
   research, such as volume change, insufficient coulombic efficiency, and
   solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer stability are elucidated.
   Finally, advanced carbon composites utilizing carbon nanotubes (CNT),
   graphene, and size preserving external shells are discussed, including
   high mass loading (thick) electrodes and electrodes capable of providing

Abstract = {{A common starting point in assessing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction
   policy implications in the built environment is to look at industry
   specific policies. This paper addressed the glaring gap between national
   alleconomy policy options that actually determine industry-specific
   programs, and their downstream impacts and implications to the building
   and construction sector. National carbon policy schemes were organised
   into two basic types: indirect pricing mechanisms, and direct pricing
   mechanisms. Their features and comparative strengths and limitations
   were critically reviewed under a common framework, drawing from a wide
   body of literature. The status of the application of the GHG reduction
   policies in China was reviewed. A green building case is studied to
   quantitatively present the effectiveness and deficiencies of the current
   GHG mitigation policies in the building sector of China, and their
   implications to a building's life cycle. Based on China's current status
   of the policy system, this paper identifies the future direction of
   building's GHG mitigation policies of China. Policies directly aiming to
   GHG mitigation in the building sector should be implemented in holistic
   and comprehensive pathway, to balance the costs and benefith of the
   stakeholders for the promotion of building GHG mitigation technologies.

Abstract = {{Background. Typically, a Fontan connection is constructed as either a
   lateral tunnel (LT) pathway or an extracardiac (EC) conduit. The LT is
   formed partially by atrial wall and is assumed to have growth potential,
   but the extent and nature of LT pathway growth have not been well
   characterized. A quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate this
   issue.
   Methods. Retrospective serial cardiac magnetic resonance data were
   obtained for 16 LT and 9 EC patients at 2 time points (mean time between
   studies, 4.2 +/- 1.6 years). Patient-specific anatomies and flows were
   reconstructed. Geometric parameters of Fontan pathway vessels and the
   descending aorta were quantified, normalized to body surface area (BSA),
   and compared between time points and Fontan pathway types.
   Results. Absolute LT pathway mean diameters increased over time for all
   but 2 patients; EC pathway size did not change (2.4 +/- 2.2 mm vs 0.02
   +/- 2.1 mm, p < 0.05). Normalized LT and EC diameters decreased, while
   the size of the descending aorta increased proportionally to BSA. Growth
   of other cavopulmonary vessels varied. The patterns and extent of LT
   pathway growth were heterogeneous. Absolute flows for all vessels
   analyzed, except for the superior vena cava, proportionally to BSA.
   Conclusions. Fontan pathway vessel diameter changes over time were not
   proportional to somatic growth but increases in pathway flows were; LT
   pathway diameter changes were highly variable. These factors may impact
   Fontan pathway resistance and hemodynamic efficiency. These findings
   provide further understanding of the different characteristics of LT and
   EC Fontan connections and set the stage for further investigation. (C)

Abstract = {{Heavy metal contamination in a long-term wastewater irrigation area in
   north China was investigated. The highest concentrations of Cr, Cd, Pb,
   As, Zn, and Cu in topsoil were 113.58, 3.78, 13.91, 14.44, 90.75, and
   95.53mg/kg, respectively. The Nemerow's synthetical pollution index was
   below 0.7, suggesting that this area belonged to a safe domain. The
   bioavailable concentrations of the heavy metals in this area were also
   maintained at low level. The correlation between Al (or Fe) and other
   heavy metals proved that concentrations of Pb, As, and Zn in soil might
   be mainly affected by the soil natural material. Spatial distributions
   analysis of heavy metals in this area indicated that the sewage
   irrigation might also have influence on heavy metals pollution in this
   long-term wastewater irrigation area. The vertical profile of heavy
   metals concentrations in this area showed that all the heavy metals in
   surface soil layer were in the highest concentration and began to
   decrease with the increase in soil depth. The low concentration of heavy
   metals in wastewater and soil suggested a potential sustainability of
   the long-term wastewater irrigation area where the good quality
   wastewater was available for agricultural usage.}},

   entrapped water microdroplets with the average size of 3-4 mu m were
   shown to be surrounded by a dense layer of the CSTN. The number droplet
   density as well as water encapsulation efficiency in the polystyrene
   beads increased with the CSTN concentration. Furthermore, regardless of
   CSTN content, all samples exhibited high encapsulation stability of over
   68 \% after 3 months. These characteristics along with good expansion

   as well as power-added efficiency under the mismatched condition close
   to that of a well-matched condition. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first fully integrated CMOS PA that is capable of automatically

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This research uses nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves to characterize
   stress corrosion cracking (SCC) damage in carbon steel. Cold rolled
   carbon steel is widely used for buried fuel pipelines; the environment
   surrounding these pipelines creates a mildly corrosive environment,
   which, in combination with an applied stress, can cause SCC. To ensure
   the safe operation of these structures, it is crucial that damage due to
   SCC be detected before their structural integrity is reduced by large
   cracks. In the early stages of SCC, microstructural changes such as
   dislocation formation and microcrack initiation occur, which have shown
   to considerably increase the acoustic nonlinearity of a material. These
   microstructural changes distort and generate higher harmonics in an
   initially monochromatic ultrasonic wave. This research considers four
   different levels of SCC induced in four separate 1018 steel specimens, a
   material which has a similar susceptibility to SCC as steel used for
   buried fuel pipelines. Then nonlinear ultrasonic measurements are
   performed before and after the SCC damage is induced. Nonlinear Rayleigh
   surface waves are utilized to detect the SCC damage that is concentrated
   near the material surface. The amplitudes of the fundamental and second
   harmonic waves are measured with contact wedge transducers at varying
   propagation distances to obtain the acoustic nonlinearity of the
   specimens as a function of SCC damage. The results show an increase in
   the measured acoustic nonlinearity in the early stages of SCC,
   indicating the feasibility of using this nonlinear ultrasonic method to
   detect the initiation of SCC in carbon steels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The unique biomechanical properties of native tissue are governed by the
   organization and composition of integrated collagen and elastin
   networks. An approach for fabricating spatially aligned,
   fiber-reinforced composites with adjustable collagen fiber dimensions,
   layouts, and distribution within an elastin-like protein matrix yielding
   a biocomposite with controllable mechanical responses is reported.
   Microtransfer molding is employed for the fabrication of hollow and
   solid collagen fibers with straight or crimped fiber geometries.
   Collagen fibers (width: 2-50 m, thickness: 300 nm to 3 m) exhibit a
   Young's modulus of 126 +/- 61 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 7
   +/- 3.2 MPa. As fiber networks within composite structures, straight
   fiber layouts display orthotropic responses with Young's modulus ranging
   from 0.95 +/- 0.35 to 10.4 +/- 0.5 MPa and tensile strength from 0.22
   +/- 0.08 to 0.87 +/- 0.5 MPa with increasing fraction of collagen fibers

Abstract = {{The ability to quantify collecting vessel function in a minimally
   invasive fashion is crucial to the study of lymphatic physiology and the
   role of lymphatic pump function in disease progression. Therefore, we
   developed a highly sensitive, minimally invasive research platform for
   quantifying the pumping capacity of collecting lymphatic vessels in the
   rodent tail and forelimb. To achieve this, we have integrated a
   near-infrared lymphatic imaging system with a feedback-controlled
   pressure cuff to modulate lymph flow. After occluding lymphatic flow by
   inflating a pressure cuff on the limb or tail, we gradually deflate the
   cuff while imaging flow restoration proximal to the cuff. Using
   prescribed pressure applications and automated image processing of
   fluorescence intensity levels in the vessels, we were able to
   noninvasively quantify the effective pumping pressure (P-eff, pressure
   at which flow is restored after occlusion) and vessel emptying rate
   (rate of fluorescence clearance during flow occlusion) of lymphatics in
   the rat. To demonstrate the sensitivity of this system to changes in
   lymphatic function, a nitric oxide (NO) donor cream, glyceryl trinitrate
   ointment (GTNO), was applied to the tails. GTNO decreased P-eff of the
   vessels by nearly 50\% and the average emptying rate by more than 60\%.
   We also demonstrate the suitability of this approach for acquiring
   measurements on the rat forelimb. Thus, this novel research platform
   provides the first minimally invasive measurements of P-eff and emptying
   rate in rodents. This experimental platform holds strong potential for
   future in vivo studies that seek to evaluate changes in lymphatic health
   and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the influence of tongue disability, age, and
   sex on motor performance for a tongue-training paradigm involving
   playing a computer game using the Tongue Drive System (TDS).
   Design: Two controlled observational studies.
   Setting: A neurorehabilitation center and a dental school.
   Participants: In study 1, tongue-disabled patients with symptoms of
   dysphagia and dysarthria (n=11) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=11)
   participated in tongue training. In study 2, healthy elderly persons
   (n=16) and healthy young persons (n=16) volunteered.
   Intervention: In study 1 and study 2, the tongue training lasted 30 and
   40 minutes, respectively. Participants were instructed to play a
   computer game with the tongue using TDS.
   Main Outcome Measures: Motor performance was compared between groups in
   both studies. Correlation analyses were performed between age and
   relative improvement in performance. Subject-based reports of
   motivation, fun, pain, and fatigue evaluated on 0-to-10 numeric rating
   scales were compared between groups.
   Results: In study 1, tongue-disabled patients performed poorer than
   healthy controls (P=.005) and with a trend of a sex difference (P=.046).
   In study 2, healthy young participants performed better than healthy
   elderly participants (P<001), but there was no effect of sex (P=.140).
   There was a significant negative correlation between age and relative
   improvement in performance (delta=.450; P =.009). There were no
   significant differences in subject-based reports of motivation, fun,
   pain, and fatigue between groups in any of the studies (P>.094).
   Conclusions: The present study provides evidence that tongue disability
   and age can influence behavioral measures of tongue motor performance.
   TDS may be a new adjunctive neurorehabilitation regimen in treating
   tongue-disabled patients. (C) 2014 by the American Congress of

Abstract = {{We introduce a statistical hypothesis test for detecting mixtures in a
   nonlinear regression model with mean regression function defined by a
   weighted sum of two multidimensional unimodal functions, where each
   unimodal function in the summation representing a component. Two
   regression components are mixed when the distance between their centres
   is small or the proportion of their contribution to the mean regression
   function is close to zero or one. Two challenges in model estimation
   under the null hypothesis of one regression component are that the
   proportion parameter describing the weighed contribution of each
   component lies on the boundary of the parameter space and that the model
   parameters are nonidentifiable. Therefore, the parameter estimators
   derived from standard nonlinear estimation approaches are inconsistent
   and unstable. To overcome these challenges, we study a penalized
   regression test statistic with a relatively simple quadratic
   approximation which can be used to simulate the quantiles of the test
   statistic under the null hypothesis. One leading application of the
   mixture testing procedure is the detection of mixed or overlapped
   components in multidimensional data generated from nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) experiments for protein structure determination. It is
   important to de-mix the components since each regression component
   provides specific information about the structure of the protein. In
   certain cases, the lack of a small number of essential components can
   lead to a significant deviation in the predicted structure. The Canadian

Abstract = {{This paper presents the Band-Reject Nested-PLL (BRN-PLL) scheme that
   simultaneously improves filtering of a noisy input signal and relaxes
   the requirements for the loop bandwidth. As the architecture employs a
   modified PLL as a divider of another PLL, a stability analysis is
   presented to demonstrate suitable operation. The BRN-PLL
   close-to-carrier output noise is dominated by the PFD/CP of the inner
   PLL and the far-from-carrier output noise is dominated by the LO of the
   outer PLL. The PFD/CP noise can be reduced by approximately 20 dB when
   the output is disconnected from the VCO during idle states, and a low
   noise floor is achieved using a passively biased double-switching pair
   LC VCO. Additionally, to maintain lower integrated phase noise, the
   proposed scheme uses a high-MEMS-based VCO to effectively smoothen the
   transition of the response between the two dominant noise sources.
   Absolute figures equal to dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and -155 dBc/Hz at 10MHz are
   measured from a 104 MHz clock-cleaner.}},

Abstract = {{Rett syndrome is a dominant X-Linked disorder caused by point mutations
   (approximately 80\%) or by deletions or insertions (approximately 15\%
   to 18\%) in the MECP2 gene. It is most common in females but Lethal in
   males, with a distinctly different phenotype. Rett syndrome patients
   have severe neurological and behavioral problems. Clinical genetic
   testing Laboratories commonly use characterized genomic DNA reference
   materials to assure the quality of the testing process; however, none
   are commercially available for MECP2 genetic testing. The Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention's Genetic Testing Reference Material
   Coordination Program, in collaboration with the genetic testing
   community and the Coriell Cell Repositories, established 27 new cell
   lines and characterized the MECP2 mutations in these and in 8 previously
   available cell lines. DNA samples from the 35 cell lines were tested by
   eight clinical genetic testing laboratories using DNA sequence analysis
   and methods to assess copy number (multiplex Ligation-dependent probe
   amplification, semiquantitative PCR, or array-based comparative genomic
   hybridization). The eight common point mutations known to cause
   approximately 60\% of Rett syndrome cases were identified, as were other
   MECP2 variants, including deletions, duplications, and frame shift and
   splice-site mutations. Two of the 35 samples were from males with MECP2
   duplications. These MECP2 and other characterized genomic DNA samples
   are publicly available from the NIGMS Repository at the Coriell Cell
   Repositories.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurochemistry
   there has been impressive progress in the understanding of the molecular
   properties of anesthetic agents. However, despite these advances, we
   still do not understand how anesthetic agents affect the properties of
   neurons that translate into the induction of general anesthesia at the
   macroscopic level. There is extensive experimental verification that
   collections of neurons may function as oscillators and the
   synchronization of oscillators may play a key role in the transmission
   of information within the central nervous system. This may be
   particularly relevant to understand the mechanism of action for general
   anesthesia. In this paper, we develop a stochastic synaptic drive firing
   rate model for an excitatory and inhibitory cortical neuronal network in
   the face of system time delays and stochastic input disturbances. In
   addition, we provide sufficient conditions for global asymptotic and
   exponential mean-square synchronization for this model. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive, invasive brain tumour with a
   poor survival rate. Available treatments are ineffective and some
   tumours remain inoperable because of their size or location. The tumours
   are known to invade and migrate along white matter tracts and blood
   vessels. Here, we exploit this characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme
   by engineering aligned polycaprolactone (PCL)-based nanofibres for
   tumour cells to invade and, hence, guide cells away from the primary
   tumour site to an extracortical location. This extracortial sink is a
   cyclopamine drug-conjugated, collagen-based hydrogel. When aligned
   PCL-nanofibre films in a PCL/polyurethane carrier conduit were inserted
   in the vicinity of an intracortical human U87MG glioblastoma xenograft,
   a significant number of human glioblastoma cells migrated along the
   aligned nanofibre films and underwent apoptosis in the extracortical
   hydrogel. Tumour volume in the brain was significantly lower following
   insertion of aligned nanofibre implants compared with the application of
   smooth fibres or no implants.}},

Title = {{Soil Microbial Community Responses to a Decade of Warming as Revealed by

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial communities are extremely complex, being composed of
   thousands of low-abundance species (<0.1\% of total). How such complex
   communities respond to natural or human-induced fluctuations, including
   major perturbations such as global climate change, remains poorly
   understood, severely limiting our predictive ability for soil ecosystem
   functioning and resilience. In this study, we compared 12
   whole-community shotgun metagenomic data sets from a grassland soil in
   the Midwestern United States, half representing soil that had undergone
   infrared warming by 2 degrees C for 10 years, which simulated the
   effects of climate change, and the other half representing the adjacent
   soil that received no warming and thus, served as controls. Our analyses
   revealed that the heated communities showed significant shifts in
   composition and predicted metabolism, and these shifts were community
   wide as opposed to being attributable to a few taxa. Key metabolic
   pathways related to carbon turnover, such as cellulose degradation
   (similar to 13\%) and CO2 production (similar to 10\%), and to nitrogen
   cycling, including denitrification (similar to 12\%), were enriched
   under warming, which was consistent with independent physicochemical
   measurements. These community shifts were interlinked, in part, with
   higher primary productivity of the aboveground plant communities
   stimulated by warming, revealing that most of the additional,
   plant-derived soil carbon was likely respired by microbial activity.
   Warming also enriched for a higher abundance of sporulation genes and
   genomes with higher G+C content. Collectively, our results indicate that
   microbial communities of temperate grassland soils play important roles
   in mediating feedback responses to climate change and advance the
   understanding of the molecular mechanisms of community adaptation to
   environmental perturbations.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exhibit the inherent
   potential to regulate multiple signaling pathways and cell types that
   contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and immune diseases.
   However, more recent studies have suggested that the secretion of
   immunomodulatory factors by MSCs can be enhanced by three-dimensional
   aggregation or pro-inflammatory cytokine treatment. Methods. Human MSC
   spheroids were formed by forced aggregation into agarose micro-wells and
   subsequently cultured in either minimal essential medium alpha
   supplemented with fetal bovine serum or serum-free, defined MesenCult-XF
   medium (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). A subset of the
   spheroids were treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon
   (IFN)-gamma or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or both for 4 days.
   Immunomodulatory factor (prostaglandin E-2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase,
   transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-6) secretion was
   quantified after 4 days of culture, and the immunomodulatory activity of
   MSCs was assessed by quantifying activated macrophage expression of
   TNF-alpha after trans-well co-culture. Results. Culturing human MSCs as
   three-dimensional aggregates increased secretion of immunomodulatory
   paracrine factors, which was enhanced further by treatment with
   IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, demonstrating that these parameters can
   synergistically enhance endogenous human MSC immunomodulatory
   properties. However, immunomodulatory factor secretion was found to be
   highly dependent on the composition of cell culture medium. Human MSCs
   cultured in MesenCult-XF medium displayed significantly less expression
   of prostaglandin E-2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, transforming growth
   factor-beta 1 and interleukin-6 compared with human MSCs cultured in
   medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Finally, pre-conditioning
   of human MSC spheroids with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha resulted in greater
   immunomodulatory activity in a macrophage co-culture assay. Conclusions.
   Altogether, engineering the environment of human MSCs to develop
   pre-conditioning strategies for enhancing human MSC immunomodulation may
   be a simple approach for improving MSC-based therapies for the treatment
   of inflammatory and immune diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Sparsity-based models have enabled significant advances in many image
   processing tasks. Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) in particular has
   benefited from these approaches due to the significant low-dimensional
   structure in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Specifically,
   previous work has shown that sparsity models can be used for spectral
   superresolution, where spectral signatures with HSI-level resolution are
   recovered from measurements with multispectral-level resolution (i.e.,
   an order of magnitude fewer spectral bands). In this letter, we expand
   on those results by introducing a new inference approach known as
   reweighted l(1) spatial filtering (RWL1-SF). RWL1-SF incorporates a more
   sophisticated signal model that allows for variations in the SNR at each
   pixel as well as spatial dependences between neighboring pixels. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed approach leverages signal
   structure beyond simple sparsity to achieve significant improvements in
   spectral superresolution.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of recovering two unknown vectors, w and x, of
   length L from their circular convolution. We make the structural
   assumption that the two vectors are members of known subspaces, one with
   dimension N and the other with dimension K. Although the observed
   convolution is nonlinear in both w and x, it is linear in the rank-1
   matrix formed by their outer product wx{*}. This observation allows us
   to recast the deconvolution problem as low-rank matrix recovery problem
   from linear measurements, whose natural convex relaxation is a nuclear
   norm minimization program. We prove the effectiveness of this relaxation
   by showing that, for ``generic{''} signals, the program can deconvolve w
   and x exactly when the maximum of N and K is almost on the order of L.
   That is, we show that if x is drawn from a random subspace of dimension
   N, and w is a vector in a subspace of dimension K whose basis vectors
   are spread out in the frequency domain, then nuclear norm minimization
   recovers wx{*} without error. We discuss this result in the context of
   blind channel estimation in communications. If we have a message of
   length N, which we code using a random L x N coding matrix, and the

Title = {{Room Level Modeling of Air Flow in a Contained Data Center Aisle}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cold aisle containment is used in air cooled data centers to minimize
   direct mixing between cold and hot air. Here, we present room level air
   flow field investigation for open, partially and fully contained cold
   aisles. Our previous investigation for rack level modeling has shown
   that consideration of momentum rise above the tile surface, due to
   acceleration of air through the pores, significantly improves the
   predictive capability as compared to the generally used porous jump
   model. The porous jump model only specifies a step pressure loss at the
   tile surface without any influence on the flow field. The momentum rise
   could be included by either directly resolving the tile's pore structure
   or by artificially specifying a momentum source above the tile surface.
   In the present work, a modified body force model is used to artificially
   specify the momentum rise above the tile surface. The modified body
   force model was validated against the experimental data as well as with
   the model resolving the tile pore geometry at the rack level and then
   implemented at the room level. With the modified body force model, much
   higher hot air entrainment and higher server inlet temperatures were
   predicted as compared to the porous jump model. Even when the rack air
   flow requirement is matched with the tile air flow supply, considerable
   hot air recirculation is predicted. With partial containment, where only
   a curtain at the top of the cold aisle is deployed and side doors are
   opened, improved cold air delivery is suggested.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneous Void Nucleation Study in Flip Chip Assembly Process Using
   No-Flow Underfill}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{No-flow underfill process has exhibited a narrow feasible process window
   due to electrical assembly yield loss or underfill voiding. In general,
   the assembly yield can be improved using reflow process designed at high
   temperature, while the high temperature condition potentially causes
   serious underfill voiding. Typically, the underfill voiding can result
   in critical defects, such as solders fatigue cracking or solders bridge,
   causing early failures in thermal reliability. Therefore, this study
   reviews a classical bubble nucleation theory to model voids nucleation
   during reflow process. The established model designed a reflow process
   possibly preventing underfill voiding. The reflow process was validated
   using systematic experiments designed on the theoretical study with a
   commercial high I/O counts (5000>), fine-pitch (<150 mu m) flip chip.
   The theoretical model exhibits good agreement with experimental results.
   Thus, this paper presents systematic studies through the use of
   structured experimentation designed to achieve a high, stable yield, and
   void-free assembly process on the classical bubble nucleation theory.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of manganese sulfate monohydrate (denoted as MSM) on the

   properties of Ni-P thin-film were examined by means of atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. AFM and SEM results showed that MSM had
   significant influences on the morphology, including the formation of
   smaller nodules, nano-size particles boundaries on both surface and
   inside of nodules. Due to the specific topologies, the resistance of
   Ni-P thin-film deposited with MSM was increased. Based on the
   characterization results, we summarized that the Mn2+ or Mn2+-compound
   were primarily confirmed to act as the stabilizer in Ni-P electroless
   process. Moreover, the verification test for Ni-P thin-film in
   application as embedded resistor was carried out through electrical,

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{81-89}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Recently, it has been shown that convex cavities or 2D grating
   structures can enhance thermal emission for energy conversion systems.
   The mechanisms, however, cannot be well explained by either the
   conventional cavity resonance modes or surface plasmon polaritons. The
   present study elucidates the fundamental mechanism by considering the
   excitation of magnetic polaritons (MPs) in deep gratings. Rigorous
   coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) is employed to calculate the radiative
   properties by solving Maxwell's equations numerically. The LC-circuit
   model is employed to predict the resonance conditions. The current and
   field distributions further confirm the excitation of magnetic
   resonances. It is shown that MPs and cavity modes agree with each other
   when the kinetic inductance is negligibly small. However, when the
   kinetic inductance is sufficiently large, the maximum resonance
   wavelength can be more than twice that predicted by the cavity mode.
   Furthermore, different materials are considered and the frequency range
   is extended from the near-infrared to the microwave region to illustrate
   the scalability of the MPs. This study clarifies one of the underlying
   mechanisms of optical resonance in deep gratings and will benefit the
   design of wavelength-selective thermal emitters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We report on efficient solar cells on recyclable cellulose nanocrystal
   (CNC) substrates with a new device structure wherein
   polyethylenimine-modified Ag is used as the bottom electron-collecting
   electrode and high-conductivity
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS,
   PH1000) is used as the semitransparent top hole-collecting electrode.
   The PEDOT:PSS top electrode is deposited by a film-transfer lamination
   technique. This dry process avoids swelling damage to the CNC substrate,
   which is observed when PEDOT:PSS is directly spin-coated from an aqueous
   solution. Solar cells on recyclable CNC substrates exhibit a maximum
   power conversion efficiency of 4.0\% with a large fill factor of 0.64
   +/- 0.02 when illuminated through the top semitransparent PEDOT:PSS
   electrode. The performance of solar cells on CNC substrates is
   comparable to that of reference solar cells on polyethersulfone
   substrates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effective photon energy absorption (EABF(eff)) and exposure buildup
   factors (EBFeff) have been calculated based on the effective energy
   concept, for some dosimetric materials such as water, polymethyl
   methacrylate (PMMA), polystyrene, solid water (WT1), RW3 (Goettingen
   Water 3), and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), for MV X-rays and
   Co-60 gamma rays. Firstly, the equivalent atomic numbers (Z (eq)) of the
   given materials have been determined using the effective photon energies
   (E (eff)). Then, the five-parameter geometric progression (G-P) fitting
   approximation has been used to calculate both EABF(eff) and EBFeff
   values. Since the G-P fitting parameters are not available for the E
   (eff) values of the given materials, a linear interpolation in which a
   function of the logarithm of the variable is used has been performed, in
   order to calculate the parameters in each E (eff), which will be further
   used for the determination of EABF(eff) and EBFeff. In the present
   paper, water equivalence properties of the given materials are also
   discussed based on the effective buildup factors. In this study, special
   emphasis is placed on the calculation of EABF(eff) and EBFeff values of
   different materials for photons that are not monoenergetic but
   heterogeneous in energy, to obtain an initial and prior knowledge of the
   probable energy and buildup of photons at locations of interest, i.e.,
   to understand whether the real absorbed dose occurs at the surface or
   somewhere inside the medium of interest.}},

Abstract = {{We consider in this paper the semiparametric mixture of two unknown

   semiparametric in the sense that the mixed distribution is not supposed

   model, it is assumed that the mixed distribution is zero symmetric, the
   model being then defined by the mixing proportion, two location
   parameters and the probability density function of the mixed
   distribution. We propose a new class of M-estimators of these parameters
   based on a Fourier approach and prove that they are n-consistent under
   mild regularity conditions. Their finite sample properties are
   illustrated by a Monte Carlo study, and a benchmark real dataset is also
   studied with our method.}},

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to characterize the properties of the
   compressional and shear waves resulting from the freezing of soil. After
   the sand-silt mixtures with different degrees of saturation (5\%, 10\%,
   20\%, 40\% and 100\%) are prepared in nylon freezing cells, the
   temperature of the specimens decreased from 20 degrees C to 10 degrees
   C. During the freezing of the soil, three pairs of piezo disk elements
   and bender elements, installed at three different locations along the
   depth, are used for the continuous measurement of the compressional and
   shear waves. The three properties of elastic waves, represented by
   velocities, resonant frequencies and amplitudes, are monitored
   continuously. Significant increases are observed in both of the elastic
   waves near the temperature of 0 degrees C. As the specimens freeze, the
   influent factor of the compressional wave velocity changes from the
   degree of saturation to the ice bonding. After soil freezing, the
   critical factor that affects the shear wave velocity turns from the
   confining stress into ice bonding and contact size. The variation of the
   resonant frequency of the elastic waves according to the temperature and
   degree of saturation is similar to the variation of the velocity of
   elastic waves. After soils are frozen, the Poisson's ratio decreases
   with an increase in the degree of saturation with ice. This study
   provides fundamental information about the change of properties of
   elastic waves in soils due to freezing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents control system design of a multi degrees-of-freedom
   (DOE) spherical wheel motor (SWM) in a class of ball-joint-like direct
   drive actuators to control orientation of the shaft. Three controllers
   (model based open-loop (OL), two closed-loop (CL) controllers) based on
   a push-pull torque model have been developed from rotor dynamics and
   magnetic field model referred to here as Distributed Multipole (DMP)
   model which provides accurate torque computation. The model based OL
   controller along with three control input shapes has been examined for
   the inclination control. Their results offer physical intuition,
   practical effectiveness, and also demonstrate the accuracy of magnetic
   field and torque computation. Then, two feedback controllers, a PD
   controller with and without the observer, have been developed for
   regulating its rotor inclination and experimentally evaluated against
   the OL controller. Finally, the performance on each controller has been
   compared to show the effect of the controllers on transient response.
   The experimental results verify control system design and demonstrate
   the motion capability of the SWM. While the experimental results
   illustrate the ability to control, they also reveal constraints and
   limitations of the controllers and provide insights for future design of
   control systems for the SWM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The left ventricular myocardium plays a key role in the entire
   circulation system and an automatic delineation of the myocardium is a
   prerequisite for most of the subsequent functional analysis. In this
   paper, we present a complete system for an automatic segmentation of the
   left ventricular myocardium from cardiac computed tomography (CT) images
   using the shape information from images to be segmented. The system
   follows a coarse-to-fine strategy by first localizing the left ventricle
   and then deforming the myocardial surfaces of the left ventricle to
   refine the segmentation. In particular, the blood pool of a CT image is
   extracted and represented as a triangulated surface. Then, the left
   ventricle is localized as a salient component on this surface using
   geometric and anatomical characteristics. After that, the myocardial
   surfaces are initialized from the localization result and evolved by
   applying forces from the image intensities with a constraint based on
   the initial myocardial surface locations. The proposed framework has
   been validated on 34-human and 12-pig CT images, and the robustness and
   accuracy are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for discrete multibody system modeling is presented.
   The approach segments the multibody system into a series of subsystems
   with kinematic constraints. The equations of motion of the unconstrained
   subsystems are either easier to obtain or already exist. The
   Udwadia-Kalaba equation is then introduced to calculate the constraint
   forces due to the constraints. The approach does not require any
   auxiliary variables, such as Lagrange multipliers, and does not need to
   use any projection. It can systematically reach the model via clustering
   of the segments.}},

   Engine. I: Transition from Rocket Booster to Ramjet Sustainer}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive numerical analysis was conducted to study the internal
   flow development in an integrated rocket-ramjet (IRR) propulsion system.
   The study consists of two parts: transition from the rocket booster to
   the ramjet sustainer and combustion dynamics during ramjet operation.
   The physical model of concern includes the entire IRR flow path,
   extending from the leading edge of the inlet center body through the
   exhaust nozzle. The theoretical formulation is based on the
   Farve-averaged conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, and
   species concentration in axisymmetric coordinates and accommodates
   finite-rate chemical kinetics and variable thermophysical properties.
   Turbulence closure is achieved using a low-Reynolds-number kappa-epsilon
   two-equation model. The governing equations are solved numerically by
   means of a finite-volume preconditioned flux-differencing scheme capable
   of treating a chemically reacting flow over a wide range of Mach
   numbers. Various important physiochemical processes involved in the
   transition from the booster to the sustainer phase are investigated
   systemically. Emphasis is placed on the flow interactions between the
   inlet diffuser and combustor. The effects of operation timing on the
   flow evolution, fuel spread, ignition, and flame development are
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an adaptive estimation framework predicated on
   multiagent network identifiers with undirected and directed graph
   topologies. Specifically, the system state and plant parameters are
   identified online using N agents implementing adaptive observers with an
   interagent communication architecture. The adaptive observer
   architecture includes an additive term which involves a penalty on the
   mismatch between the state and parameter estimates. The proposed
   architecture is shown to guarantee state and parameter estimate
   consensus. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive identifier architecture
   provides a measure of agreement of the state and parameter estimates
   that is independent of the network topology and guarantees that the
   deviation from the mean estimate for both the state and parameter
   estimates converge to zero. Finally, an illustrative numerical example
   is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.}},
