Title = {{Effect of Moderate Magnetic Annealing on the Microstructure,

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of moderate magnetic fields on the
   microstructure of a structural epoxy system was investigated. The
   changes in the microstructure have been quantitatively investigated
   using wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and pole figure analysis. The
   mechanical properties (modulus, hardness, and strain rate sensitivity
   parameter) of the epoxy system annealed in the magnetic field were
   probed with the aid of instrumented nanoindentation, and the results are
   compared to the reference epoxy sample. To further examine the creep
   response of the magnetically annealed and reference samples, short 45
   min duration creep tests were carried out. An equivalent to the
   macroscale creep compliance was calculated using the aforementioned
   nanocreep data. Using the continuous contact compliance (CCC) analysis,
   the phase lag angle, tan (delta), between the displacement and applied
   force in an oscillatory nanoindentation test was measured for both neat
   and magnetically annealed systems through which the effect of low
   magnetic fields on the viscoelastic properties of the epoxy was invoked.
   The comparison of the creep strain rate sensitivity parameter, A/d(0),
   from short term(80 s), creep tests and the creep compliance J(t) from
   the long term (2700 s) creep tests with the tan (delta) suggests that
   former parameter is a more useful comparative creep parameter than the
   creep compliance. The results of this investigation reveal that for the
   epoxy system cured under low magnetic fields both the quasi-static and
   viscoelastic mechanical properties have been improved. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Sound-source localization behavior was studied in the plainfin
   midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) by making use of the naturally
   occurring phonotaxis response of gravid females to playback of the
   male's advertisement call. The observations took place outdoors in a
   circular concrete tank. A dipole sound projector was placed at the
   center of the tank and an 80-90. Hz tone (the approximate fundamental
   frequency to the male's advertisement call) was broadcast to gravid
   females that were released from alternative sites approximately 100 cm
   from the source. The phonotaxic responses of females to the source were
   recorded, analyzed and compared with the sound field. One release site
   was approximately along the vibratory axis of the dipole source, and the
   other was approximately orthogonal to the vibratory axis. The sound
   field in the tank was fully characterized through measurements of the
   sound pressure field using hydrophones and acoustic particle motion
   using an accelerometer. These measurements confirmed that the sound
   field was a nearly ideal dipole. When released along the dipole
   vibratory axis, the responding female fish took essentially straight
   paths to the source. However, when released approximately 90 deg to the
   source's vibratory axis, the responding females took highly curved paths
   to the source that were approximately in line with the local particle
   motion axes. These results indicate that the acoustic cues used by fish
   during sound-source localization include the axes of particle motion of
   the local sound field.}},

Title = {{Extending Fluorescence Thermometry to Measuring Wall Surface
   Temperatures Using Evanescent-Wave Illumination}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{Cooling microelectronics with heat flux values of hundreds of kW/cm(2)
   over hot spots with typical dimensions well below 1 mm will require new
   single- and two-phase thermal management technologies with micron-scale
   addressability. However, experimental studies of thermal transport
   through micro- and mini-channels report a wide range of Nusselt numbers
   even in laminar single-phase flows, presumably due in part to variations
   in channel geometry and surface roughness. These variations make
   constructing accurate numerical models for what would be otherwise
   straightforward computational simulations challenging. There is,
   therefore, a need for experimental techniques that can measure both bulk
   fluid and wall surface temperatures at micron-scale spatial resolution
   without disturbing the flow in both heat transfer and microfluidics
   applications. We report here the evaluation of a nonintrusive technique,
   fluorescence thermometry (FT), to determine wall surface and bulk fluid
   temperatures with a spatial resolution of O(10 mu m) for water flowing
   through a heated channel. Fluorescence thermometry is typically used to
   estimate water temperature fields based on variations in the emission
   intensity of a fluorophore dissolved in the water. The accuracy of FT
   can be improved by taking the ratio of the emission signals from two
   different fluorophores (dual-tracer FT or DFT) to eliminate variations
   in the signal due to (spatial and temporal) variations in the excitation
   intensity. In this work, two temperature-sensitive fluorophores,
   fluorescein and sulforhodamine B, with emission intensities that
   increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature, are
   used to further improve the accuracy of the temperature measurements.
   Water temperature profiles were measured in steady Poiseuille flow at
   Reynolds numbers of 3.3 and 8.3 through a 1 mm(2) heated minichannel.
   Water temperatures in the bulk flow (i.e., away from the walls) were
   measured using DFT with an average uncertainty of 0.2 degrees C at a
   spatial resolution of 30 mu m. Temperatures within the first 0.3 mu m
   next to the wall were measured using evanescent-wave illumination of a
   single temperature-sensitive fluorophore with an average uncertainty of
   less than 0.2 degrees C at a spatial resolution of 10 mu m. The results
   are compared with numerical predictions, which suggest that the water
   temperatures at an average distance of similar to 70 nm from the wall
   are identical within experimental uncertainty to the wall surface
   temperature. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004871]}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, research efforts have focused on the design,
   development and deployment of unmanned systems for a variety of
   applications ranging from intelligence and surveillance to border
   patrol, rescue operations, etc. Micro Aerial Vehicles are viewed as
   potential targets that can provide agility and accurate small area
   coverage while being cost-effective and can be easily launched by a
   single operator. The small size of MAVs allows such flight operations
   within confined space but the control effectors must provide sufficient
   maneuverability, while maintaining stability, with only limited sensing
   capability onboard the platform. To meet these challenges, researchers
   have long been attracted by the amazing attributes of biological
   systems, such as those exhibited by birds and insects. Birds can fly in
   dense flocks, executing rapid maneuvers with g-loads far in excess of
   modern fighter aircrafts, and yet never collide with each other, despite
   the absence of air traffic controllers. This paper introduces a novel
   framework for the design and control of a Micro Air Vehicle. The
   vehicle's conceptual design is based on biologically-inspired principles
   and emulates a dragonfly (Odonata-Anisoptera). A sophisticated
   multi-layered Hybrid \& Linear/Non-Linear controller to achieve extended
   flight times and improved agility compared to other Rotary and Flapping
   Wing MAV designs. The paper addresses the design and control features of
   the proposed QV design and gives an overview on the developmental
   efforts towards the prototyping of the flyer. The potential applications
   for such a high endurance vehicle are numerous, including air-deployable
   mass surveillance in cluster and swarm formations. The disposable nature
   of the vehicle would help in battle-field deployment as well, where such
   a MAV would be made available to soldiers for proximity sensing and
   threat level assessment. Other applications would include search and
   rescue operations and civilian law-enforcement.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{A combined layer-by-layer (LbL) surface amine amplification and
   electroless deposition process has been developed to convert
   biologically replicable three-dimensional (3-D) nanostructured
   micro-assemblies (such as siliceous diatom frustules) into freestanding
   Cu-bearing or Ni-bearing structures that retain the starting biogenic
   microscale 3-D shapes and nanoscale patterns. After reacting the
   hydroxyl-bearing surfaces of these biotemplates with an aminosilane, a
   LbL polyacrylate/polyamine deposition process was used to dendritically
   amplify the surface amine concentration. Subsequent binding of metal
   chloride catalysts to these amine-enriched surfaces enabled the rapid
   electroless deposition of thin, conformal, continuous, and
   nanocrystalline or amorphous metallic coatings on the 3-D biotemplates.
   Selective removal of the underlying templates then yielded freestanding
   Cu-bearing or Ni-bearing structures. The conformality and continuity of
   the thin coatings, and the fidelity with which the biogenic shape and
   fine features were preserved in the freestanding structures, were
   significantly enhanced by the amplification of surface amines (and the
   associated enrichment of catalytic sites) resulting from the LbL
   polyacrylate/polyamine treatment. Monolithic and multicomponent
   structures (e. g., Cu, multilayer Au/Cu, CuO, and Ni-P alloy) with
   bio-derived morphologies have been synthesized utilizing this approach.
   This readily-scalable process may be used to convert self-assembled
   rigid templates (of biological or synthetic origin) into nanostructured
   transition metal-based micro-assemblies with a wide variety of
   selectable 3-D hierarchical morphologies for use in numerous functional
   and structural applications.}},

Abstract = {{Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles were mixed into poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)

   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed, and the ultrasonic

   investigated. As revealed by FTIR spectra, large amount of-OH groups
   were exist in the hybrid membrane due to the addition of Mg(OH)(2)
   nanoparticles, and these -OH groups are responsible for the
   hydrophilicity increase of the modified membrane. BSA and E. coli
   adsorption measurements confirm that hybrid membrane exhibited higher
   antifouling property than the original PVDF membrane, as the number of
   adsorbed proteins and bacterial cells on the membrane surface were
   reduced dramatically. PEG and Mg(OH)(2) had mutual effects on the
   resulting structures and properties including porosity and permeability
   of the membrane. The superiority of the PVDF/Mg(OH)(2) membrane in
   filtering bacterial solution was significant, as the resistances with

Abstract = {{Safavynia SA, Ting LH. Task-level feedback can explain temporal
   recruitment of spatially fixed muscle synergies throughout postural
   perturbations. J Neurophysiol 107: 159-177, 2012. First published
   September 28, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00653.2011.-Recent evidence suggests
   that complex spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activity can be explained
   with a low-dimensional set of muscle synergies or M-modes. While it is
   clear that both spatial and temporal aspects of muscle coordination may
   be low dimensional, constraints on spatial versus temporal features of
   muscle coordination likely involve different neural control mechanisms.
   We hypothesized that the low-dimensional spatial and temporal features
   of muscle coordination are independent of each other. We further
   hypothesized that in reactive feedback tasks, spatially fixed muscle
   coordination patterns-or muscle synergies-are hierarchically recruited
   via time-varying neural commands based on delayed task-level feedback.
   We explicitly compared the ability of spatially fixed (SF) versus
   temporally fixed (TF) muscle synergies to reconstruct the entire time
   course of muscle activity during postural responses to
   anterior-posterior support-surface translations. While both SF and TF
   muscle synergies could account for EMG variability in a postural task,
   SF muscle synergies produced more consistent and physiologically
   interpretable results than TF muscle synergies during postural responses
   to perturbations. Moreover, a majority of SF muscle synergies were
   consistent in structure when extracted from epochs throughout postural
   responses. Temporal patterns of SF muscle synergy recruitment were
   well-reconstructed by delayed feedback of center of mass (CoM)
   kinematics and reproduced EMG activity of multiple muscles. Consistent
   with the idea that independent and hierarchical low-dimensional neural
   control structures define spatial and temporal patterns of muscle
   activity, our results suggest that CoM kinematics are a task variable
   used to recruit SF muscle synergies for feedback control of balance.}},

Abstract = {{By quantifying the evolution of void ratio in granular soils of
   different angularity under different normal stress levels adjacent to
   geomembranes of varying roughness at different stages of shearing, the
   effect of geomembrane surface roughness on the interface shear
   mechanisms between granular materials and geomembranes was investigated.
   The extent of the shear zone thickness at the interfaces between
   combinations of round/angular particles and smooth/textured geomembrane
   surfaces were evaluated. For smooth geomembranes, the interface shear
   strength is developed by sliding and plowing of sand particles, while
   for textured geomembranes, the strength results from the interlocking
   and dilation of sand particles. Study on the effect of particle
   angularity showed that more angular sand particles resulted in larger
   plowing effects with smooth geomembranes which in turn yielded higher
   residual friction angles than with rounded to sub-rounded sand. Higher
   normal stress produced larger plowing effects for a given sand sheared
   against a smooth geomembrane and reduced the amount of dilation adjacent

Abstract = {{The harvesting of ambient energy to power small electronic components
   has received tremendous attention over the last decade. The research
   goal in this field is to enable self-powered electronic components for
   use particularly in wireless sensing and measurement applications.
   Thermal energy due to temperature gradients, solar energy and ambient
   vibrations constitute some of the major sources of energy that can be
   harvested. Researchers have presented several papers focusing on each of
   these topics separately. This paper aims to develop a hybrid power
   generator and storage system using these three sources of energy in
   order to improve both structural multifunctionality and system-level
   robustness in energy harvesting. A multilayer structure with flexible
   solar, piezoceramic, thin-film battery and metallic substructure layers
   is developed (with the overhang dimensions of 93 mm x 25 mm x 1.5 mm in
   cantilevered configuration). Thermal energy is also used for charging
   the thin-film battery layers using a 30.5 mm x 33 mm x 4.1 mm generator.
   Performance results are presented for charging and discharging of the
   thin-film battery layers using each one of the harvesting methods. It is
   shown based on the extrapolation of a set of measurements that 1 mA h of
   a thin-film battery can be charged in 20 min using solar energy (for a
   solar irradiance level of 223 W m(-2)), in 40 min using thermal energy
   (for a temperature difference of 31 degrees C) and in 8 h using
   vibrational energy (for a harmonic base acceleration input of 0.5g at
   56.4 Hz).}},

Title = {{An MR image-guided, voxel-based partial volume correction method for PET
   images}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{179-194}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Partial volume effect in positron emission tomography (PET) can
   cause incorrect quantification of radiopharmaceutical uptake in
   functional imaging. A PET partial volume correction method is presented
   to attenuate partial volume blurring and to yield voxel-based corrected
   PET images.
   Methods: By modeling partial volume effect as a convolution of point
   spread function of the PET scanner, the reconstructed PET images are
   corrected by iterative deconvolution with an edge-preserving smoothness
   constraint. The constraint is constructed to restore discontinuities
   extracted from coregistered MR images but maintains the smoothness in
   radioactivity distribution. The correction is implemented in a Bayesian
   deconvolution framework and is solved by a conjugate gradient method.
   The performance of the method was compared with the geometric transfer
   matrix (GTM) method on a simulated dataset. The method was evaluated on
   synthesized brain FDG-PET data and phantom MRI-PET experiments.
   Results: The true PET activity of objects with a size of greater than
   the full-width at half maximum of the point spread function has been
   effectively restored in the simulated data. The partial volume
   correction method is quantitatively comparable to the GTM method. For
   synthesized FDG-PET with true activity 0 mu ci/cc for cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF), 228 mu ci/cc for white matter (WM), and 621 mu ci/cc for
   gray matter (GM), the method has improved the radioactivity
   quantification from 186 +/- 16 mu ci/cc to 30 +/- 7 mu ci/cc in CSF, 317
   +/- 15 mu ci/cc to 236 +/- 10 mu ci/cc for WM, 438 +/- 4 mu ci/ cc to
   592 +/- 5 mu ci/cc for GM. Both visual and quantitative assessments show
   improvement of partial volume correction in the synthesized and phantom
   experiments.
   Conclusions: The partial volume correction method improves the
   quantification of PET images. The method is comparable to the GTM method
   but does not need MR image segmentation or prior tracer distribution
   information. The voxel-based method can be particularly useful for
   combined PET/MRI studies. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Fatigue crack growth mechanisms of long cracks through fields with low
   and high residual stresses were investigated for a common structural
   aluminum alloy, 6061-T61. Bulk processing residual stresses were
   introduced in the material by quenching during heat treatment. Compact
   tension (CT) specimens were fatigue crack growth (FCG) tested at varying
   stress ratios to capture the closure and K (max) effects. The changes in
   fatigue crack growth mechanisms at the microstructural scale are
   correlated to closure, stress ratio, and plasticity, which are all
   dependent on residual stress. A dual-parameter Delta K-K (max) approach,
   which includes corrections for crack closure and residual stresses, is
   used uniquely to connect fatigue crack growth mechanisms at the
   microstructural scale with changes in crack growth rates at various
   stress ratios for low- and high-residual-stress conditions. The methods
   and tools proposed in this study can be used to optimize existing
   materials and processes as well as to develop new materials and

Abstract = {{Clinical debate has arisen over the consequences of antioxidant
   supplementation during cancer chemotherapy. While antioxidants may
   impede the efficacy of chemotherapy by scavenging reactive oxygen
   species and free radicals, it is also possible that antioxidants
   alleviate unwanted chemotherapy-induced toxicity, thus allowing for
   increased chemotherapy doses. These contradictory assertions suggest
   that antioxidant supplementation during chemotherapy treatment can have
   varied outcomes depending on the cellular context. To gain a more robust
   understanding of the role that antioxidants play in chemotherapy, we
   investigated the dose-dependent effects of the antioxidant,
   N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on the redox-mediated regulation of
   intracellular signaling. In this study, we systematically evaluated the
   effect of Dox-induced ROS on the NF-kappa B pathway in a pediatric acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line by measuring the thiol-based
   oxidative modifications of redox-sensitive proteins within the pathway.
   We report a functional consequence of NAC supplementation during
   doxorubicin (Dox) chemotherapy administration via the NF-kappa B
   (NF-kappa B) signal transduction pathway. The ability of NAC to alter
   Dox-induced NF-kappa B activity is contingent on the ROS-mediated
   S-glutathionylation of IKK-beta. Moreover, the NAC-dependent alteration
   of intracellular glutathione redox balance, through pro-oxidant and
   antioxidant mechanisms, can be exploited to either promote or inhibit
   Dox-induced NF-kappa B activity in an NAC-concentration-dependent
   manner. We developed an electron-transfer-based computational model that
   predicts the effect of NAC pretreatment on Dox-induced NF-kappa B
   signaling for a range of NAC and Dox treatment combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Graphitic thin films embedded with highly dispersed titanium dioxide
   (TiO2) nanoparticles were incorporated for the first time into the
   conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), resulting in a
   remarkably improved cell efficiency due to its superior electron
   conductivity. Massively ordered arrays of TiO2 dots embedded in carbon
   matrix were fabricated via UV-stabilization of
   polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) films containing TiO2 precursors
   followed by direct carbonization. For dye-sensitized TiO2 based solar
   cells containing carbon/TiO2 thin layers at both sides of pristine TiO2
   layer, an increase of 40.6\% in overall power conversion efficiency was
   achieved compared with neat TiO2-based DSSCs. Such a remarkably improved
   cell efficiency was ascribed to the superior electron conductivity and
   extended electron lifetime elucidated by cyclic voltamrnetry and
   impedance spectroscopy.}},

   atomic force microscope (AFM) images show that the OTS-8 treated surface
   produces much larger grains of pentacene (similar to 500 nm) compared to
   OTS-18 (similar to 100 nm). X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed

Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{In simulation, perhaps the most common use of the term `fidelity' refers
   to the faithfulness with which model behavior reflects modeled system
   behavior. While there have been studies of fidelity seeking absolute and
   quantitative measures, there is not yet a consensus on a workable
   fidelity metric. We propose a formal modeling framework for comparing
   discrete event system simulation models in terms of fidelity, using a
   relative fidelity indicator. Based on the framework, we consider the
   possibility that the higher fidelity simulation models can also be more
   productive, even though they are more expensive to develop and use,
   since they can be used to achieve multiple objectives. First, we propose
   a formal simulation modeling framework within which the fidelity of
   simulation models can be discussed. With this framework and a simple
   example, we then define a relative fidelity indicator that provides a
   systematic way of comparing the fidelity of two simulation models. The
   relative fidelity indicator focuses on the most important
   characteristics in simulation studies: the input and output interfaces
   and the variables used for specifying a real-world system and simulation
   models. It does not require any special modeling formalism for model
   comparison. Based on the relative fidelity indicator and simulation
   modeling framework, we state the optimum simulation model selection
   problem to achieve given simulation objectives. Under a practical
   assumption, we analyze the simulation model selection problem and derive
   properties related to simulation modeling and the fidelity of simulation
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The variational asymptotic method (VAM) is used to develop a beam theory
   for the planar deformation of isotropic strips with initial in-plane
   curvature. This VAM-based theory provides asymptotically exact
   expressions for the strain energy per unit length and the
   cross-sectional stress and strain in terms of 1D generalized strain
   variables. It is first linearized and successfully verified by
   comparison with elasticity solutions in the literature. It is then used
   to carry out verification for certain aspects of the computer program
   VABS (variational asymptotic beam section). In particular, the
   comparison shows that variations of cross-sectional stiffnesses vs.
   initial curvature obtained from VABS 3.3 are in error, and that
   corrections embodied in VABS 3.4 capture the correct behavior. Finally,
   two different methodologies are proposed, both of which can be
   implemented in VABS in the future to improve the results: a partial
   transformation to generalized Timoshenko theory and evaluation of the
   second-order warping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Material selection of tube receiver is a critical issue to ensure the
   reliability during its whole service life. In this study, the thermal
   stress analyses of tube receiver under concentrated solar irradiation
   condition using various materials are carried out. The concentrated
   solar irradiation heat flux distribution is obtained by Monte-Carlo ray
   tracing method and used as boundary conditions of the Computational
   Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The CFD analysis will solve the
   temperature fields and the resulted temperature fields defined at the
   nodes of CFD analysis meshes are interpolated as input data to the nodes
   of the thermal stress analysis meshes. The temperature fields, thermal
   stress fields of various material conditions are obtained in the
   numerical analysis. The numerical results show that the temperature
   gradients and effective stresses of the stainless steel and silicon
   carbide (SiC) conditions are significantly higher than that of the
   aluminum and copper conditions. The stress failure ratio is introduced
   to assess the thermal stress level of each material condition. The
   stainless steel condition has the highest stress failure ratio and the
   copper condition has the lowest stress failure ratio. From the
   standpoint of thermal stress, copper is recommended to be the material
   of tube receiver. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New structural alloys based on borosilicides of molybdenum have been
   considered as potential replacements for current Ni-base superalloys, as
   they show promise as highly oxidation- and creep-resistant materials
   while still maintaining a moderate level of damage tolerance. Two
   alloys, each composed of Mo-3Si-1B (wt.\%) with nominally similar
   fine-grained microstructures, have been developed utilizing markedly
   differing processing routes. Here, we study the influence of processing
   route on the fracture toughness of alloys containing similar to 55
   vol.\% ductile alpha-Mo and similar to 45 vol.\% brittle intermetallics
   (Mo3Si (A15) and Mo5SiB2 (T2)). The room temperature toughness of these
   two alloys is significantly lower than that of previously evaluated
   coarser-grained Mo-Si-B alloys with similar composition; however at 1300
   degrees C, the crack-initiation toughness of the fine- and
   coarse-grained alloys are nearly identical. At lower temperatures, the
   current finer-grained materials behave in a brittle manner as the
   smaller grains do not provide much impediment to crack extension; cracks
   can advance with minimal deflection thereby limiting any extrinsic
   toughening. Plastic constraint of ductile alpha-Mo grains by the hard
   intermetallic grains also serves to lower the toughness. Silicon
   impurity concentrations in the grain boundaries in the fine-grained
   alloys are much higher, leading to lower grain-boundary strengths and
   contributing to the much lower room temperature initiation toughnesses
   of these alloys (no stable crack growth was observed), as compared to
   the coarser-grained alloys. At 1300 degrees C, the increased ductility
   of alpha-Mo allows for significant plasticity; the correspondingly much
   larger contribution from intrinsic toughening results in significantly
   enhanced toughness, such that the finer grain morphology becomes less
   important in limiting crack growl:h resistance. Further optimization of
   these alloys, however, is still required to tailor their microstructures
   for the mutually exclusive requirements of oxidation resistance, creep
   resistance and damage tolerance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The dual sideband optical carrier suppression (DSBOCS) technique is
   characterised for its performance in order to be used as a carrier for
   1.25Gbps OOK signal in the 40GHz radio over fibre (ROF) system. A dual
   electrode Mach-Zehnder modulator (DE-MZM) and the minimum transmission
   bias (MiTB) technique are employed to build the system. The results show
   that, a 40GHz carrier is successfully generated with the amplitude up to
   -29dBm and SNR of 35d B. Finally, an error free 40GHz ROF system is
   constructed with almost no penalty between the back to back and 20km
   fibre for a BER of 10(-9).}},

Abstract = {{Cranes are the primary heavy lifter used in a wide array of industries.
   For the transport of large payloads, multiple cranes are often employed
   in a cooperative manner. One factor limiting the efficiency of all
   cranes is payload oscillation. For multi-crane lifts, the payload
   oscillation is a function of an array of crane and payload parameters,
   many of which are difficult to measure in real-time. This paper
   investigates the use of the estimates of the multi-crane natural
   frequencies in input shaper design. Two methods to design input shapers
   that rely only on the suspension cable lengths involved in the lift are
   presented. The accuracy of these estimations and the resulting
   effectiveness of input-shaping control are studied via simulation and
   experimental testing with a two-crane system.}},

Abstract = {{Helicopters are often used to transport supplies and equipment to
   hard-to-reach areas. When a load is carried via suspension cables below
   a helicopter, the load oscillates in response to helicopter motion and
   external disturbances, such as wind. This oscillation is dangerous and
   adversely affects control of the helicopter, especially when carrying
   heavy loads. To provide better control over the helicopter, one approach
   is to suppress the load swing dynamics using a command-filtering method
   called input shaping. This approach does not require real-time
   measurement or estimation of the load states. A simple model of a
   helicopter carrying a suspended load is developed and experimentally
   verified on a micro coaxial radio-controlled helicopter. In addition,
   the effectiveness of input shaping at eliminating suspended load
   oscillation is demonstrated on the helicopter. The proposed model may
   assist with the design of input-shaping controllers for a wide array of
   helicopters carrying suspended loads.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial lifts are machines that enable human workers to comfortably work
   at heights that might otherwise be inaccessible. They typically have
   multiple long-reach arms to enable working at such heights. There is
   typically enough flexibility in these arms to result in deflections of
   the lift endpoint, the bucket where the operators are located. These
   deflections can be excited by either motion of the operators within the
   bucket or by operator commands moving the bucket around the workspace.
   Input shaping is one method that can drastically reduce the
   motion-induced oscillation. This paper investigates the application of
   input shaping to one category of aerial lifts, commonly called
   cherrypickers. When input shaping is used, the endpoint vibration is
   reduced. However, it is not completely eliminated due to the nonlinear
   nature of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary voltage controls, as a non-cost voltage control, are often
   conducted by utilities as the first option to solve voltage violations.
   Utilities like PJM and MISO manually coordinate secondary voltage
   controls aiming at regulating voltage profile and avoiding the use of
   potentially costly controls, such as transmission loading relief or load
   shedding. The speed of secondary voltage control devices ranges from
   three up to 15 minutes, depending on the control mode (either automatic
   or manual). Increasing voltage stability has not (in the past) been
   considered as a control objective. In this paper, a novel decentralized
   secondary voltage control system is designed to automatically generate
   optimal control decisions meeting different control objectives (such as
   maximum stability margin, minimum controls and losses). The proposed
   system aims at providing fast and coordinated secondary voltage control
   decisions in the time range from several seconds to a few minutes.
   Comparative studies are performed between the proposed system and
   existing secondary voltage control approaches applied in utilities.}},

Abstract = {{Microarrays are massively parallel biosensors that can simultaneously
   detect and quantify a large number of different genomic particles. A DNA
   microarray is a nucleic acid-based microarray that contains probe spots
   testing a multitude of targets in one experiment. Ideas from compressive
   sensing have been utilized in different ways in the analysis of DNA
   microarrays. One of the proposed methods is compressed microarrays,
   where each spot contains copies of several probes and the total number
   of spots is lower, resulting in significantly reduced costs due to
   cheaper array manufacturing. In this paper, we perform compressed
   microarray experiments with real aCGH data and demonstrate the accuracy
   of various recovery methods. Our experimental results suggest that the
   measurements that can be captured by compressed microarrays can be
   recovered accurately using the proposed norm-minimization methods.}},

   observing that polar codes are useful for channel resolvability over

Abstract = {{The existence of significant amount of correlation in the network
   traffic has stimulated the development of in-network traffic reduction
   techniques since end-to-end universal compression solutions would not
   perform well over Internet packets due to the finite-length nature of
   data. Recently, we proposed a memory-assisted universal compression
   technique that holds a significant promise for reducing the amount of
   traffic in the networks. The idea is based on the observation that if a
   finite-length sequence from a server (source) is to be compressed and
   transmitted over the network, the associated universal code entails a
   substantial overhead. On the other hand, intermediate nodes can reduce
   the transmission overhead by memorizing the source statistics when
   forwarding the sequences from the previous communications with the
   server. In this paper, we extend this idea to the scenario where
   multiple servers are present in the network by proposing distributed
   network compression via memory. We consider two spatially separated
   sources with correlated unknown source parameters. We wish to study the
   universal compression of a sequence of length n from one of the sources
   provided that the decoder has access to (i.e., memorized) a sequence of
   length m from the other source. In this setup, the correlation does not
   arise from symbol-by-symbol dependency of two outputs from the two
   sources (as in Slepian-Wolf setup). Instead, the two sequences are
   correlated because they are originated from the two sources with unknown
   correlated parameters. The finite-length nature of the compression
   problem at hand requires considering a notion of almost lossless source
   coding, where coding incurs an error probability p(e)(n) that vanishes
   as sequence length n grows to infinity. We obtain bounds on the
   redundancy of almost lossless codes when the decoder has access to a
   random memory of length m as a function of the sequence length n and the
   permissible error probability p(e)(n). Our results demonstrate that
   distributed network compression via memory has the potential to
   significantly improve over conventional end-to-end compression when
   sufficiently large memory from previous communications is available to
   the decoder.}},

Abstract = {{In 2009, a group of seventeen students majoring in electrical, computer,
   or systems engineering became the first class of Leaders in Engineering
   Program (LEP) students at East Central State University(1). The LEP is
   an undergraduate curriculum focused on developing knowledge and skills
   that address both component-level design (electrical or computer
   engineering) and system-level integration.
   The current situation for majors in electrical and computer engineering
   at East Central State University is that the curriculum is focused on
   developing strong technical skills to design and analyze electrical or
   computer engineering components. For systems majors, the curriculum is
   focused on developing rigorous skills for approaching a problem from a
   systems perspective and for modeling the performance of systems under
   conditions of uncertainty. The objective of the LEP is to develop
   systems engineering graduates with the ability to work on
   technology-oriented projects and electrical/computer engineering
   graduates with the ability to integrate their domain-specific designs
   into larger systems.
   The purpose of this paper is to describe the research plan for
   determining how well the LEP is able to accomplish its objectives for
   graduates. The initial group of seventeen students is in their senior
   year during the 2011-12 academic year and all are completing capstone
   design projects. Five of the seventeen students decided to drop out of
   the LEP at various times during the last two years. Statistical baseline
   data to be gathered includes the types of jobs each student pursues
   after graduation, the type and number of internships each student
   completes during their summers, and their overall academic success.
   Interviews with faculty advisors of LEP capstone projects will provide
   information on the performance of LEP students relative to their non-LEP
   peers on real world projects. Finally, a performance activity will be
   used to directly observe if and how LEP students approach systems
   integration problems differently from their peers.}},

Abstract = {{The future of engineering education research will depend on
   collaborations among educators, researchers, and students. Participation
   in research collaborations helps graduate students within the
   engineering education community gain an understanding of the challenges
   of such endeavors as well as various ways of overcoming those
   challenges. Over the course of their program, engineering education
   graduate students will collaborate with a variety of people, including
   faculty members, members of industry, and, in some cases, their fellow
   students. Research collaborations among graduate students provide a
   means to diversify interests, develop research skills, build
   relationships, and advance engineering education research.
   The purpose of this study was to explore the factors that affect
   graduate students' willingness to participate in collaborative
   engineering education research with other graduate students. This
   research was conducted in two phases: a literature review and a pilot
   study. The first phase involved a literature review to provide insight
   about the barriers and bridges to multidisciplinary and dispersed
   collaborations. In the second phase of the study, we sought to gain an
   initial understanding of graduate students' perceptions of collaborative
   research. A pilot study was conducted at a graduate student research
   workshop, which was designed to help attendees develop research
   questions for collaborative research. Findings showed that while
   graduate students expressed great interest in pursuing collaborative
   research, they largely did not do so because of a lack of time, support,
   and concerns regarding conflict with potential collaborators.
   Suggestions to promote collaborative research among graduate students
   include providing specific venues online and at conferences to encourage
   inter-student interaction and facilitate collaborative work.}},

Abstract = {{The Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia
   Tech and Emory University has implemented a problem-based learning
   approach in the systems physiology instructional lab. Traditional lab
   coursework was originally redesigned and tested as part of a comparison
   experiment in the spring of 2007. In subsequent years, the lessons
   learned with the first cohort were enacted in curriculum. This paper
   reports on comparisons of data from the 2011 cohort with that of the
   original 2007 cohorts-experimental and control.
   In our original 2007 comparison experiment, students in the
   problem-based learning section reported having less confidence in the
   lab environment and with techniques than the control group that
   participated in the traditional curriculum. This was in contrast to
   their actual mastery of the skills practiced in this course that was
   better for the pbl experimental group than for the traditional control
   cohort. Interventions in the form of a lab manual and focused
   facilitation were put into place. Data from this follow-up study (2011)
   indicate that confidence in the lab setting and with techniques was,
   indeed, improved at a statistically significant level without
   sacrificing student perceptions of independence.}},

Abstract = {{During a weeklong summer camp, high school students were introduced to
   aviation and the airline industry. The camp curriculum used airline
   simulation software to provide students hands-on experience with some of
   the major challenges faced in the airline industry. The students formed
   teams that were tasked with creating and operating an airline, including
   purchasing aircraft; determining where and when the aircraft would fly
   while ensuring satisfactory maintenance checks; and determining staffing
   levels, advertising expenditures, and ticket prices. Throughout the
   week, lectures and activities presented by graduate students and
   professors aided the decision-making process of the new airline
   executives. The camp also included two field trips to Atlanta's
   Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and the Delta Air Lines'
   Heritage Museum. The evaluation of this summer program utilized pre-post
   surveys to measure the impact of camp experience on student
   self-efficacy and STEM interest. The evaluation was also designed to
   determine students' interest and understanding of the airline industry.
   Overall, the evaluation results showed the camp was a positive learning
   experience for students.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering education is evolving to become an environment of
   project-based learning, research assistantships, and other mechanisms
   that approximate the research and collaborative aspects of true-to-life
   processes. From this diverse set of learning environments, students are
   expected to not only gain technical skills, but also social and group
   skills relevant to the realities of collaborative work in engineering.
   This expectation is in turn underscored by ABET accreditation standards,
   which extend beyond simply technical skills to include the development
   and learning of professional skills. In this paper, we ask: From an
   instructional perspective, how can learning outcomes be better observed
   so that faculty can provide appropriate guidance and occasional control?
   What are the sources of this diversity of learning within student
   groups? How do the ways that engineering students interact in team
   network environments matter for the skills that they develop through
   this experience? Scholars working in the science of learning argue that
   peer-relations form a social context of knowledge creation that
   constitutes a foundation for the development of team-skills. In this
   paper, we show how peer relations develop, and subsequently provide
   knowledge and learning resources within multi-ranked student teams over
   time. The data in this paper are based on a multi-year evaluation of the
   NSF-funded Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program at two
   institutions. The VIP Program brings together graduate and undergraduate
   students to solve applied engineering problems. Results show different
   patterns of knowledge seeking and exchange behavior across student
   groups. These results show that technical knowledge sources are distinct
   from project management and related information needs. Most
   interestingly, results show that knowledge exchange does not maintain
   its hierarchy. Undergraduate students develop their own information
   communities within teams, including regarding technical information.
   These results have important implications for the management of teams
   that include a range of students and expertise.}},

Abstract = {{As part of IEEE's mission to further engineering education and support
   faculty and student development, the IEEE Educational Activities Board
   (EAB) along with the IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) Committee created
   the Real-World Engineering Projects (RWEP) program. The goal of the RWEP
   program is to provide university educators of electrical engineering
   (EE), computer engineering (CE), computer science (CS), biomedical
   engineering (BE) and electrical engineering technology (EET) with a
   library of high-quality, tested, hands-on, team-based, and
   society-focused projects for first-year students.
   These projects are designed to increase the recruitment, persistence to
   degree, and satisfaction of all students, in baccalaureate EE, CE, CS,
   BE and EET degree programs. In many EE/CE/CS/BE/EET programs, current
   first-year curricula focus on the theoretical and mathematical
   components of engineering. The vehicle for change is a series of
   IEEE-approved hands-on projects that educators are able to use in the
   first-year classroom in order to acquaint their students to the practice
   of these disciplines.
   The projects clearly demonstrate a benefit to society in general and
   also involve the students at a more intimate level than a typical
   lecture. Research has shown the recruitment of women gains significantly
   from the illustration of how electrical and computer engineers and
   computer scientists benefit society. The persistent under-participation
   of women in engineering and computer science is an area of continued
   concern to governments, industry leaders, policy making bodies, and
   professional associations.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the development and teaching of a first
   undergraduate course in nanoelectronics. The uniqueness of the course
   lies in the following facts: It is modular in structure. Computational
   nanotechnology has been made an integral part of the course. It provides
   hands-on experience with real samples and equipment. High-Performance
   Computing Cluster (HPCC) has been used for modeling and simulation. The
   course has been developed for a university that does not have many
   state-of-the-art facilities available at larger research universities,
   and at the same time caters to a student population with great diversity
   in background preparation. The course was offered at the junior/senior
   level to electrical engineering majors. The main objectives of the
   course were to teach the characterization and fabrication of
   nanomaterials, simulation of nanomaterials and devices, operation and
   design of devices, and the design and fabrication of integrated
   circuits, at the nanoscale. The course was divided into four modules and
   was developed by four faculty members using an iterative procedure. The
   four faculty members had expertise in the areas of nanoscale fabrication
   and characterization, computational nanotechnology, nanoscale devices,
   and nanoscale integrated circuits. The four modules in the course were
   introduction to nanoscale fabrication and characterization, basic
   computational nanotechnology, introduction to nanoscale devices, and
   introduction to nanoscale integrated circuits. The course was taught
   during Summer Semester 1 of 2011, by the four faculty members who
   developed the course. A detailed course schedule, which specified topics
   which were to be covered each day, was given to the students. The
   modules were taught in the following sequence: Basic computational
   nanotechnology, Nanoscale fabrication and characterization, Nanoscale
   devices, and Nanoscale integrated circuits. Students were assigned
   grades on the basis of in-class assignments and projects. Students
   evaluated instruction at the end of each module by anonymously filling
   in a questionnaire. At the end of the course, students provided their
   feedback about the course. The course was well-received by the students.}},

Abstract = {{3D integration becomes promising to be able to continue the system
   integration trend due to short TSV interconnection used for stacked
   dies. This paper proposes an efficient transient thermal modeling method
   using non-conformal domain decomposition approach for 3D stacked ICs and
   systems. To alleviate the problem arising from the feature scale
   difference between stacked dies as well as package and PCB, the 3D
   system is divided into many subdomains. Each subdomain (die, package or
   PCB) can be meshed independently using different gridding based on its
   feature size and therefore the required meshing cells are greatly
   reduced compared to conventional method such as finite element or finite
   volume method. The heat flow continuity between subdomains is captured
   using the introduced interface basis functions. In addition, the
   proposed compact micro-fluidic model based on finite volume method is
   proved to be compatible with the finite element model for solid medium
   based on introduced forced convection boundary and energy conservation.
   The experimental results show the proposed method offers up to 5x
   unknown reduction and 91x speed-up compared to conventional finite
   element method.}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation networks play a fundamental part in the agriculture system of
   various countries. In the wake of global environmental challenges and
   economic competition, efficient use of water resources has become
   extremely important. This can only be achieved by developing smarter
   control infrastructures for irrigation networks, via the incorporation
   of communication and computation technologies. Thus, future irrigation
   networks represent a prime example of cyber physical systems. Effective
   operation of these complex cyber physical systems is not possible with
   conventional methods and requires unprecedented levels of automation and
   decision-support tools. We argue that these cyber physical systems will
   require a complete model-driven toolset for effective operation. As a
   first step towards that tool flow, we have developed a model-driven
   simulation infrastructure for irrigation networks. In the future, we
   propose to complete the toolset by developing a model-driven
   configuration infrastructure. Our contributions in this paper include
   the development of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) for
   irrigation networks, implementation of this DSML in Generic Modeling
   Environment (GME), and automatic simulator M-file generation capability
   from the DSML-based case diagram of an arbitrary irrigation network.
   Moreover, we present case studies of water distribution and flood
   management to show the utility as well as the effectiveness of our
   approach. We also present the performance of our toolset for the
   realistic scenario of irrigation networks in Pakistan.}},

Abstract = {{The prospect of new biological and industrial applications that require
   communication in micro-scale, encourages research on the design of
   bio-compatible communication networks using networking primitives
   already available in nature. One of the most promising candidates for
   constructing such networks is to adapt and engineer specific types of
   bacteria that are capable of sensing, actuation, and above all,
   communication with each other. In this paper, we describe a new
   architecture for networks of bacteria to form a data collecting network,
   as in traditional sensor networks. The key to this architecture is the
   fact that the node in the network itself is a bacterial colony; as an
   individual bacterium (biological agent) is a tiny unreliable element
   with limited capabilities. We describe such a network under two
   different scenarios. We study the data gathering (sensing and multihop
   communication) scenario as in sensor networks followed by the consensus
   problem in a multi-node network. We will explain as to how the bacteria
   in the colony collectively orchestrate their actions as a node to
   perform sensing and relaying tasks that would not be possible (at least
   reliably) by an individual bacterium. Each single bacterium in the
   colony forms a belief by sensing external parameter (e.g., a molecular
   signal from another node) from the medium and shares its belief with
   other bacteria in the colony. Then, after some interactions, all the
   bacteria in the colony form a common belief and act as a single node. We
   will model the reception process of each individual bacteria and will
   study its impact on the overall functionality of a node. We will present
   results on the reliability of the multihop communication for data
   gathering scenario as well as the speed of convergence in the consensus
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{As the semiconductor industry continues to push to smaller critical
   dimensions, pattern collapse during lithographic processing caused by
   unbalanced capillary forces during the final rinse and drying process
   has become an important problem that can limit the practical resolution
   of a resist material to feature sizes larger than its intrinsic
   resolution limit. One of the primary modes of pattern collapse is via
   elastoplastic pattern deformation which is strongly related to the
   mechanical properties of the resist. One approach to mitigating such
   collapse problems is to enhance the mechanical properties of the resist
   features. Since such modification of resist physical properties for
   pattern collapse purposes is difficult to achieve through modified
   formulation of the resist itself (i.e. due to the complex set of
   requirements that a resist must satisfy and the complex set of physical
   and chemical phenomena that underlie the imaging processing itself), we
   have pursued an alternative strategy for improving the resist mechanical
   properties after features are developed in the film but before they are
   rinsed and dried. The family of techniques being developed in this work
   function through the use of aqueous compatible reactive rinse solutions
   that can be applied to developed resist features while they are wet
   during normal rinse processing on a track system. By applying these
   techniques during the rinse process, the resist features can be
   strengthened before they are subjected to significant capillary forces
   during the final drying step. In this work, the use of diamine compounds
   to reactively crosslink the surface of resists containing carboxylic
   acid groups through formation of amide bonds using carbodiimide
   chemistry has been explored. One advantage of this approach is that it
   is an aqueous process that should be easily compatible with high volume,
   track-based lithographic processes. Contact angle studies and x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the surface
   crosslinking reaction using such diamine surface rinse treatments.
   Pattern collapse test structures were fabricated and analyzed to measure
   the amount of mechanical property improvement imparted by such
   treatments. Application of such amine reactive rinses was found to
   clearly result in an improvement in the resistance of resists to pattern
   collapse as observed by SEM. A comparison of the critical stress at the
   point of pattern collapse as a function of resist feature size also
   clearly shows a significant improvement in mechanical resilience of
   resist samples processed with the reactive rinse treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Developing a coordinated maintenance policy for modern complex systems
   is challenging due to the coupling among individual maintenance
   schedules for each component. Modeling the maintenance process of an
   individual component can be described bya relatively small number of
   distinct states. In contrast, creating a system-level model that
   captures all relevant coupling leads to a state-space explosion. To
   address this issue, develops a method for effective representation of
   the combined influenceof all other system components on a given
   component. An analytical method is developed for combining effects of
   multiple components into a single Weibull distribution. The accuracy of
   this approach was demonstrated for representing the combined effect of
   Weibull and lognormal distributions. In particular, it is shown that the
   proposed method provides a superior match to the combined distribution
   in the relevant time range as compared to standard methods of
   approximating a distribution (e.g., matching moments).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the crack sensing performance of a wireless and
   passive smart-skin sensor designed as a folded patch antenna. When
   strain/deformation occurs on the patch antenna, the antenna's electrical
   length changes and its electromagnetic resonance frequency also changes
   accordingly. An inexpensive off-the-shelf radiofrequency identification
   (RFID) chip is adopted in the sensor design for signal modulation and
   collision avoidance. With assistance from the RFID chip, the resonance
   frequency change can be interrogated and recorded by a wireless reader.
   The RF interrogation energy from the reader is captured by the patch
   antenna, and then used to activate the RFID chip that transmits
   modulated signal back to the reader. Therefore, the interrogation
   process is wireless and the antenna sensor is battery-free. In this
   research, crack sensing performance of the antenna sensor is studied and
   tested by a specially designed crack testing device. Testing results
   show strong correlation between interrogated resonance frequency and
   crack opening size.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an effective approach to estimate human body joints
   from a monocular video captured with a handheld camera for clinical
   jumping analysis. In this framework, the video frames are classified
   into color blobs and represented by region adjacency graphs (RAGs).
   Then, the corresponding body parts in the current frame are extracted
   and tracked based on the labels of RAG nodes in the previous frame using
   a semantic graph growing method. Initially, each RAG node of the current
   frame is associated with its most similar RAG node of the previous
   frame. Then, in order to reduce the mismatches in the initial
   association, the skeleton of legs is constructed to find the correct leg
   parts. In addition, a loose stick figure model is used to disambiguate
   the misassignment by enforcing geometric constraints defined between
   consecutive frames. Finally, the joint positions are estimated and
   smoothed using a priori knowledge of the jumping process. Experimental
   results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.}},

   predictions in the whole shape space based on a Sobolev-type metric for
   curves which allows unrestricted infinite dimensional deformations. For
   the measurement model, we utilize contours which locally minimize a
   segmentation energy function and focus on the multiple contour tracking
   framework when there are many local minima of the segmentation energy to
   be detected. The method detects figures moving without the need of

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors have been shown
   to provide target signatures which enable discrimination of landmines
   from harmless clutter. In particular, frequency-domain EMI sensors are
   well-suited for target characterization by inverting a physics-based
   signal model. In many model-based signal processing paradigms, the
   target signatures can be decomposed into a weighted sum of parameterized
   basis functions, where the basis functions are intrinsic to the target
   under consideration and the associated weights are a function of the
   target sensor orientation. When spatial data is available, the diversity
   of the measured signals may provide more information for estimating the
   basis function parameters. After model inversion, the basis function
   parameters can be used as features for classifying the target as
   landmine or clutter. In this work, feature extraction from spatial
   frequency-domain EMI sensor data is investigated. Results for data
   measured with a prototype frequency-domain EMI sensor at a standardized
   test site are presented. Preliminary results indicate that Structured
   relevance vector machine (sRVM) regression model inversion using spatial
   data provides stable, and sparse, sets of target features.}},

Abstract = {{The T cell receptor (TCR) interacts with peptide-major
   histocompatibility complex (pMHC) to enable T cell development and
   trigger adaptive immune responses. For this reason, TCR:pMHC
   interactions have been intensely studied for over two decades. However,
   the details of how various binding parameters impact T cell activation
   remain elusive. Most measurements were made using recombinant proteins
   by surface plasmon resonance, a three-dimensional (3D) technique in
   which fluid-phase receptors and ligands are removed from their cellular
   environment. This approach found TCR:pMHC interactions with relatively
   low affinities and slow off-rates for agonist peptides. Newer generation
   techniques have analyzed TCR:pMHC interactions in two dimensions (2D),
   with both proteins anchored in apposing plasma membranes. These
   approaches reveal in situ TCR:pMHC interaction kinetics that are of high
   affinity and exhibit rapid on- and off-rates upon interaction with
   agonist ligands. Importantly, 2D binding parameters correlate better
   with T cell functional responses to a spectrum of ligands than 3D
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Many older adults wish to remain in their own homes as they age {[}16].
   However, challenges in performing home upkeep tasks threaten an older
   adult's ability to age in place. Even healthy independently living older
   adults experience challenges in maintaining their home {[}13].
   Challenges with home tasks can be compensated through technology, such
   as home robots. However, for home robots to be adopted by older adult
   users, they must be designed to meet older adults' needs for assistance
   and the older users must be amenable to robot assistance for those
   needs. We conducted a needs assessment to (1) assess older adults'
   openness to assistance from robots; and (2) understand older adults'
   opinions about using an assistive robot to help around the home. We
   administered questionnaires and conducted structured group interviews
   with 21 independently living older adults (ages 65-93). The
   questionnaire data suggest that older adults prefer robot assistance for
   cleaning and fetching/organizing tasks overall. However their assistance
   preferences discriminated between tasks. The interview data provided
   insight as to why they hold such preferences. Older adults reported
   benefits of robot assistance (e.g., the robot compensating for
   limitations, saving them time and effort, completing undesirable tasks,
   and performing tasks at a high level of performance). Participants also
   reported concerns such as the robot damaging the environment, being
   unreliable at or incapable of doing a task, doing tasks the older adult
   would rather do, or taking up too much space/storage. These data, along
   with specific comments from participant interviews, provide the basis
   for preliminary recommendations for designing mobile manipulator robots
   to support aging in place.}},

   frequency selective surface (FSS) operating away from its normal

   printed patterns, which allows for the tenability of the FSS to any
   frequency that the fabrication method will allow. The basic operation of
   an FSS, the reasoning behind selecting the chosen unit element and
   fabrication, and a comparison of simulated and measured results are
   discussed in detail. An inkjet-printed prototype on a glossy paper
   substrate utilizing silver nanoparticles verifies the easy and scalable

Abstract = {{Intradermal (ID) vaccination can offer improved immunity and simpler
   logistics of delivery, but its use in medicine is limited by the need
   for simple, reliable methods of ID delivery. ID injection by the Mantoux
   technique requires special training and may not reliably target skin,
   but is nonetheless used currently for BCG and rabies vaccination.
   Scarification using a bifurcated needle was extensively used for
   smallpox eradication, but provides variable and inefficient delivery
   into the skin. Recently, ID vaccination has been simplified by
   introduction of a simple-to-use hollow microneedle that has been
   approved for ID injection of influenza vaccine in Europe. Various
   designs of hollow microneedles have been studied preclinically and in
   humans. Vaccines can also be injected into skin using needle-free
   devices, such as jet injection, which is receiving renewed clinical
   attention for ID vaccination. Projectile delivery using powder and gold
   particles (i.e., gene gun) have also been used clinically for ID
   vaccination. Building off the scarification approach, a number of
   preclinical studies have examined solid microneedle patches for use with
   vaccine coated onto metal microneedles, encapsulated within dissolving
   microneedles or added topically to skin after microneedle pretreatment,
   as well as adapting tattoo guns for ID vaccination. Finally,
   technologies designed to increase skin permeability in combination with
   a vaccine patch have been studied through the use of skin abrasion,
   ultrasound, electroporation, chemical enhancers, and thermal ablation.
   The prospects for bringing ID vaccination into more widespread clinical
   practice are encouraging, given the large number of technologies for ID
   delivery under development.}},

Abstract = {{The Integer Programming Problem (IP) for a polytope P subset of R-n is
   to find an integer point in P or decide that P is integer free. We give
   a randomized algorithm for an approximate version of this problem, which
   correctly decides whether P contains an integer point or whether a (1 +
   is an element of)-scaling of P about its center of gravity is integer
   free in O(1/is an element of(2))(n)-time and O(1/is an element
   of)(n)-space with overwhelming probability. We reduce this approximate
   IP question to an approximate Closest Vector Problem (CVP) in a
   ``near-symmetric{''} semi-norm, which we solve via a randomized sieving
   technique first developed by Ajtai, Kumar, and Sivakumar (STOC 2001).
   Our main technical contribution is an extension of the AKS sieving
   technique which works for any near-symmetric semi-norm. Our results also
   extend to general convex bodies and lattices.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is enabling the development of devices in a scale ranging
   from one to a few one hundred nanometers. Nanonetworks, i.e., the
   interconnection of nano-scale devices, are expected to expand the
   capabilities of single nano-machines by allowing them to cooperate and
   share information. Traditional communication technologies are not
   directly suitable for nanonetworks mainly due to the size and power
   consumption of existing transmitters, receivers and additional
   processing components. All these define a new communication paradigm
   that demands novel solutions such as nano-transceivers, channel models
   for the nano-scale, and protocols and architectures for nanonetworks. In
   this talk, first the state-of-the-art in nano-machines, including
   architectural aspects, expected features of future nano-machines, and
   current developments are presented for a better understanding of the
   nanonetwork scenarios. Moreover, nanonetworks features and components
   are explained and compared with traditional communication networks.
   Novel nano-antennas based on nano-materials as well as the terahertz
   band are investigated for electromagnetic communication in nanonetworks.
   Furthermore, molecular communication mechanisms are presented for
   short-range networking based on ion signaling and molecular motors, for
   medium-range networking based on flagellated bacteria and nanorods, as
   well as for long-range networking based on pheromones and capillaries.
   Finally, open research challenges such as the development of network
   components, molecular communication theory, and new architectures and
   protocols, which need to be solved in order to pave the way for the
   development and deployment of nanonetworks within the next couple of
   decades are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict a semiconductor's band edge positions in solution
   is important for the design of photocatalyst materials. In this paper,
   we introduce an experimental method based on Kelvin probe force
   microscopy (KPFM) to estimate the conduction and valence band edge
   energies of semiconductors, which has never been demonstrated
   experimentally. We test the method on six well known semiconductor
   materials: alpha-Fe2O3, CeO2, Al2O3, CuO, TiO2, and ZnO. The predicted
   band edge positions for alpha-Fe2O3, Al2O3, and CuO were not
   statistically different from the literature values. Except CeO2, all
   other metal oxides had consistent upward bias in the experimental
   determination of band edge positions probably because of the potential
   shielding effect of the adsorbed surface water layer. This experimental
   approach represents a unique way of probing the band edge energy
   positions of metal oxide materials without using the thermodynamic
   information (e.g., enthalpy or entropy), which is often not available
   for new synthetic or complex materials.}},

Abstract = {{Wiener filter is widely used to equalize the signals over inter-symbol
   interference (ISI) channels because of its low complexity and optimality
   in terms of mean square error (MSE). However, Wiener filter is generally
   not optimal in terms of symbol detection error and thus can exhibit
   considerable error performance degradation in ISI channels. Recently, to
   enhance the performance of linear equalizers, lattice reduction (LR)
   technique is proposed, which shows significant gain for multi-input
   multi-output systems. In this paper, we propose LR-aided Wiener filter
   that aims at minimizing the MSE for the symbols in lattice-reduced
   domain. Simulations show that the LR-aided Wiener filter exhibits
   significant error performance improvement over the Wiener filter,
   especially for higher-order modulations.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications require the analysis of structures with cavities
   filled with fluids or gases. In many cases the fluid domains can be
   ignored, and we can safely assume that the structure's in vacuo
   properties apply. Sometimes, however, resonances in the fluid can couple
   with structural resonances to yield acousto-elastic modes of response.
   The most popular approach to these problems is to describe the trapped
   fluid in terms of a finite number of eigenmodes of a geometrically
   identical cavity with rigid boundaries. Then, the structural and fluid
   domains are coupled by matching the pressure across the wetted surface.
   However, for light structures with embedded cavities of relatively heavy
   fluids such as water, this technique may not be satisfactory because the
   interior rigid-cavity modes are poor candidates to satisfy the ``natural
   boundary conditions{''} that exist at the fluid-structure boundary. This
   paper explores the use of an expanded set of Ritz functions for the
   fluid domain, to include a number of functions that explicitly allow for
   motion along the wetted surface. The method is applied to a
   two-dimensional rectangular acoustic cavity, with rigid boundaries on
   all sides except for a flexible membrane on the top surface. Through
   comparisons with the ``exact solution,{''} it is shown that the solution
   using the expanded set of Ritz functions converges more quickly than do
   solutions employing rigid cavity modes. The convergence trends of the
   first few natural frequencies are computed for a number of different
   physical and geometric system properties.}},

Abstract = {{We consider topology optimization of lumped and continuous nonlinear
   metamaterial systems. Structures that consist of alternating layers of
   material with high impedance contrast are a simple example of a
   continuous phononic crystal that may exhibit nonlinearity. Analysis of
   this system, subject to prescribed constraints, shows that optimal
   design for a bilayered system consists of a thin nonlinear layer
   Optimal, in this context, refers to a design which maximizes the
   frequency shift (and thus bandgap shift) at the edge of the first
   Brillouin Zone for the acoustic branch. Computer simulations of this
   system validate the predicted dispersion behavior. Optimization of
   two-dimensional arrays is presented using lumped-parameter models with
   nonlinear spring elements. Pattern-search algorithms identify topology
   (discrete mass distributions) that produce large increases in complete
   bandgap width. The analytical expression used in calculating nonlinear
   frequency shifts reveals that the largest contributions to the frequency
   shift are primarily produced from the resonant components of the system.
   Optimizing continuous multidimensional unit cells using a commercial
   finite-element code is briefly addressed.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a shooting method that provides numerical
   solutions to static equilibrium equations for intrinsically curved beams
   in three-dimensions. Notably, the method avoids iteration for cantilever
   beams subjected to distributed or point follower loads. This is due to
   the governing equations being given in first-order form such that the
   specification of a single boundary condition on the forced end results
   in automatic satisfaction of the fixed boundary condition. Also
   documented is a general procedure for finding all solutions to static
   beam problems with conservative loading. This is particularly useful in
   beam buckling problems where multiple stable and unstable solutions
   exist. The procedure for finding all solutions is built around the
   Picard-Lindelof theorem on the uniqueness and existence of solutions to
   initial value problems. Using the presented approach, three-dimensional
   equilibrium solutions are generated for many loading cases and boundary
   conditions, including a three-dimensional helical beam, and are compared
   to similar solutions available in the literature. The stability of the
   generated solutions is assessed using a dynamic finite element code
   based on the same intrinsic beam equations. Due to the absent need for
   iteration, the presented approach may find application in model-based
   control for practical problems such as the control of equipment utilized
   in endoscopic surgeries and the control of spacecraft with robotic arms
   and long cables.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting has been heavily researched over the
   last decade with a primary focus on resonant excitation. However,
   ambient vibrational energy often has broader frequency content than a
   single harmonic, and in many cases it is entirely stochastic. As
   compared to the literature of deterministic energy harvesting, very few
   authors presented modeling approaches for energy harvesting from
   broadband random vibrations. These efforts have combined the input
   statistical information with the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF)
   dynamics of the energy harvester to express the statistical
   electromechanical response characteristics. In most cases, the motion
   input (base acceleration) is assumed to be ideal white noise. White
   noise has a flat power spectral density (PSD) that might in fact excite
   higher vibration modes of an electroelastic energy harvester. In
   particular, piezoelectric energy harvesters constitute such continuous
   electroelastic systems with more than one vibration mode. This paper
   presents modeling and simulations of piezoelectric energy harvesting
   from broadband random vibrations based on distributed-parameter
   electroelastic solution. For white noise - type base acceleration of a
   given PSD level, first the general solution of the distributed-parameter
   problem is given. Closed-form representations are extracted for the
   single-mode case and these are analogous to the SDOF equations reported
   in the literature of energy harvesting. It is reported that the
   single-mode predictions might result in significant mismatch as compared
   to multi-mode predictions. Using the electroelastic solution, soft and
   hard piezoelectric power generators are compared under broadband random
   excitation. Shunt damping effect of power generation on the stochastic
   vibration response under broadband random excitation is also reported.}},

Abstract = {{Mechatronic design is traditionally supported through domain-specific
   design activities throughout the product development process. The
   partitioning into domain-specific problems leads to a situation where
   product properties influence each other, hence giving rise to
   dependencies. These dependencies play a key role in prediction of
   properties and as a result, in the decision making process. The
   important question is: how to manage the dependencies for an efficient
   and effective decision making? The aim of this paper is threefold.
   Firstly, we investigate the nature of dependencies and study how to
   model them. The paper proposes appropriate language constructs taking
   into account synthesis and analysis nature of properties and
   dependencies. The concepts related to the dependency modeling are then
   illustrated through a simple robot design example, where the creation
   and importance of a dependency model are explained. Secondly, we study
   practical approaches for consistency management and model management in
   the presence of dependencies. Six levels-of-detail in modeling
   dependencies are presented; emphasizing that modeling at higher
   level-of-detail ensures that more inconsistencies are avoided. Available
   languages such as OMG SysML (TM) are evaluated for a possible creation
   of the dependency models leading towards executable dependency networks.
   However, at present, SysML does not provide sufficiently rich language
   constructs to model dependencies. Thirdly, we compare our dependency
   modeling approach to the other state-of-the-art approaches such as
   dependency modeling with a Design Structure Matrix, and highlight the
   benefits of the language constructs proposed in this paper. We aim to
   convince the reader that there is a substantial value in modeling
   dependencies explicitly, especially to avoid inconsistencies, which is
   not the current state of the practice. However, an overall value from
   dependency modeling can only be obtained if the cost of creating the
   dependency model is reasonable. Issues such as human interaction/effort
   and model management through PLM are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Modern systems are difficult to design because of a need to satisfy many
   different stakeholder concerns from a number of domains, which require a
   large amount of expert knowledge. Current systems engineering practices
   try to simplify the design process by providing practical approaches to
   manage the large amount of knowledge and information needed during the
   process. Although these methods make designing a system more practical,
   they do not support a structured decision making process, especially at
   early stages when designers are selecting the appropriate system
   architecture, and instead rely on designers using ad hoc frameworks that
   are often self-contradictory, i.e., they can lead to alternative
   orderings where alternative A is better than alternative B is better
   than alternative C which is then better than alternative A. In order to
   support a more rational design making process, designers need to
   explicitly model the architecture selection decision and related
   knowledge. Then computational tools can be applied to guide the decision
   making. As a first step toward this more comprehensive modeling
   approach, in this paper a language is presented for modeling
   system-level architecture decisions by capturing the relevant
   domain-specific knowledge. This language is based on the principles of
   decision-based design and decision theory, where decisions are made by
   picking the alternative, which results in the most preferred expected
   outcomes. Therefore, the language is designed to capture potential
   alternatives in a compact form, analysis knowledge used to predict the
   quality of a particular alternative, and evaluation criteria to
   differentiate between outcomes. This language is based on the Object
   Management Group's System Modeling Language (SysML). Where possible,
   existing SysML constructs are used and when additional constructs are
   needed SysML's profile mechanism is used to extend the language. The
   value of the language is demonstrated by using it to represent a simple
   architecture selection decision of the actuation subsystem of a
   hydraulic excavator. Since this language models the architecture
   decision in a form that is computer interpretable, model transformations
   can be used to generate relevant analyses that can guide the decision
   maker during the design process.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of droplets onto a substrate in ink-jet printing is critical
   for control and optimization of the droplet deposition process to
   improve part quality and accuracy and to reduce the manufacturing time.
   However, most previous research on droplet impingement dynamics Mainly
   utilized one metric - the droplet spreading radius, which does not
   provide enough information for manufacturing purposes. This paper
   presents a new metric that is relevant to manufacturing by
   characterizing the droplet shape by measuring the similarity between the
   droplet shape and a desired shape over time. This enables a model of
   droplet shape evolution and optimization of the droplet deposition
   process to build desired geometries. Meanwhile, analyses with this shape
   metric aids understanding the physics of droplet shape evolution during
   impingement. A 2-D shape metric is first proposed and test cases are
   given to validate the effectiveness of the Shape metric. Then the
   definition is extended to characterize 3-D droplet shape. Results also
   show the 3-D shape metric is effective and robust.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency in data center operation depends on many factors,
   including power distribution, thermal load and consequent cooling costs,
   and IT management in terms of how and where IT load is placed and moved
   under changing request loads. Current methods provided by vendors
   consolidate IT loads onto the smallest number of machines needed to meet
   application requirements. This paper's goal is to gain further
   improvements in energy efficiency by also making such methods `spatially
   aware', so that load is placed onto machines in ways that respect the
   efficiency of both cooling and power usage, across and within racks. To
   help implement spatially aware load placement, we propose a model-based
   reinforcement learning method to learn and then predict the thermal
   distribution of different placements for incoming workloads. The method
   is trained with actual data captured in a fully instrumented data center
   facility. Experimental results showing notable differences in total
   power consumption for representative application loads indicate the
   utility of a two-level spatially-aware workload management (SpAWM)
   technique in which (i) load is distributed across racks in ways that
   recognize differences in cooling efficiencies and (ii) within racks,
   load is distributed so as to take into account cooling effectiveness due
   to local airflow. The technique is being implemented using online
   methods that continuously monitor current power and resource usage
   within and across racks, sense Blade Center-level inlet temperatures,
   understand and manage IT load according to an environment's thermal map.
   Specifically, at data center level, monitoring informs SpAWM about power
   usage and thermal distribution across racks. At rack-level, SpAWM
   workload distribution is based on power caps provided by maximum inlet
   temperatures determined by CRAG speeds and supply air temperature. SpAWM
   can be realized as a set of management methods running in VMWare's
   ESXServer virtualization infrastructure. Its use has the potential of
   attaining up to 32\% improvements on the CRAG supply temperature
   requirement compared to non-spatially aware techniques, which can lower
   the inlet temperature 2 similar to 3 degrees C, that is to say we can
   increase the CRAG supply temperature 2 similar to 3 degrees C to save
   nearly 13\% -18\% cooling energy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an engine sizing and cycle selection study of ultra
   high bypass ratio engines applied to a subsonic commercial aircraft in
   the N+2 (2025) timeframe. NASA has. created the Environmentally
   Responsible Aviation (ERA) project to serve as a technology transition
   bridge between fundamental research (TRL 1-4) and potential commercial
   application (TRL 7). Specifically, ERA is focused on subsonic transport
   technologies that could reach TRL 6 by 2020 and can be integrated into
   an advanced vehicle concept to simultaneously meet the ERA project
   metrics for noise, emissions, and fuel burn. An important variable in
   exploring the technology trade space is the selection of the optimal
   engine cycle for use on the advanced aircraft. Previous literature
   demonstrated the cycle optimization using a design of experiments (DOE)
   to explore the engine cycle design space for a pre-defined technology
   package. However, since the optimal engine cycle is dependent upon the
   specific technology package, this process would have to be repeated to
   ensure optimal performance for each technology package. With more than
   80 technologies to be analyzed, the combinatorial space of technology
   packages is enormous. As a result, executing a DOE to find the optimum
   engine cycle for each technology package is infeasible. To address this
   issue, it is proposed to use surrogate models that encompass the engine
   cycle and technology design space to enable fast and accurate
   optimization of the engine cycle for any given technology package.
   This paper describes the generation and analysis of surrogate models
   used for technology assessment and cycle optimization of an ultra high
   bypass geared turbofan engine architecture. The first study in the paper
   shows that a single surrogate model can be used to accurately simulate
   both a technology and cycle design space. To demonstrate the proposed
   surrogate modeling approach, the cycle design space for three different
   technology packages was analyzed. This study demonstrated that when an
   optimal cycle is found within the constrained interior of a design
   space, the surrogate modeling approach is quite accurate. The study also
   established that the surrogate models can also be used to assess
   potential cycles at the boundaries or even outside of the region for
   which they were trained.}},

Abstract = {{Recent increases in fuel prices and increased focus on aviation's
   environmental impacts have reignited focus on the open rotor engine
   concept. This type of architecture was extensively investigated in
   previous decades but was not pursued through to commercialization due to
   relatively high noise levels and a sudden, sharp decrease in fuel
   prices. More recent increases in fuel prices and increased government
   pressure from taxing carbon-dioxide production mean the open rotor is
   once again being investigated as a viable concept. Advances in
   aero-acoustic design tools have allowed industry and academia to
   re-investigate the open rotor with an increased emphasis on noise
   reduction while retaining the fuel burn benefits due to the increased
   propulsive efficiency. Recent research with conceptual level
   multidisciplinary considerations of the open rotor has been performed
   {[}1], but there remains a need for a holistic approach that includes
   the coupled effects of the engine and airframe on fuel burn, emissions,
   and noise.
   Years of research at Georgia Institute of Technology have led to the
   development of the Environmental Design Space (EDS) {[}2]. EDS serves to
   capture interdependencies at the conceptual design level of fuel burn,
   emissions, and noise for conventional and advanced engine and airframe
   architectures. Recently, leveraging NASA Environmentally Responsible
   Aviation (ERA) modeling efforts, EDS has been updated to include an open
   rotor model to capture, in an integrated fashion, the effects of an open
   rotor on conventional airframe designs. Due to the object oriented
   nature of EDS, the focus has been on designing modular elements that can
   be updated as research progresses. A power management scheme has also
   been developed with the future capability to trade between fuel
   efficiency and noise using the variable pitch propeller system. Since
   the original GE open rotor test was performed using a military core,
   there is interest in seeing the effect of modern core-engine technology
   on the integrated open rotor performance. This research applies the
   modular EDS open rotor model in an engine cycle study to investigate the
   sensitivity of thermal efficiency improvements on open rotor
   performance, including the effects on weight and vehicle performance.
   The results are that advances in the core cycle are necessary to enable.
   future bypass ratio growth and the trades between core operating
   temperatures and size become more significant as bypass ratio continues
   to increase. A general benefit of a 30\% reduction in block fuel is seen
   on a 737-800 sized aircraft.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes measurements and correlations of turbulent
   consumption speeds, S-T,S-GC, of hydrogen/carbon monoxide (H-2/CO) fuel
   mixtures, with a focus on recently acquired elevated pressure data.
   Turbulent consumption speed data were obtained at mean flow velocities
   and turbulence intensities of 30 < U-0 < 50 m/s and 5 < mu(rms)'/S-L,S-0
   < 30, respectively, for H-2/CO mixtures ranging from 30-90\% H-2 by
   volume at 5 and 10 atm. Experiments were conducted where the mixture
   equivalence ratio, (phi), was adjusted at each fuel composition to have
   nominally the same un-stretched laminar flame speed, S-L,S-0. In
   comparing two blends with the same composition, S-L,S-0 value, and flow
   conditions, the 5 and 10 atm data have S-T,S-GC values that are
   consistently about 1.8 and 2.2 times larger than the 1 atm data,
   respectively. These data are also correlated with a scaling law derived
   from quasi-steady leading points concepts using detailed kinetics
   calculations of highly stretched flames. For a given pressure, these
   scalings do an excellent job in scaling data obtained across the H-2/CO
   fuel composition and fuel/air range. However, the pressure sensitivities
   are not captured by this scaling. This pressure sensitivity. may be more
   fundamentally a reflection of the non-quasi-steady nature of the flame
   leading points. In support of this argument, we show that the spread in
   the data can largely be correlated with the ratio of a chemical time
   scale to a flow time scale.}},

Abstract = {{Power plants are complex systems consisting of thousands of
   heterogeneous components. The maintenance policy of such systems
   includes grouping the maintenance actions of different components. This
   grouping of the maintenance actions together with functional
   interactions between the components results in system level models that
   are highly coupled. Accurate models of the maintenance process would
   allow plant managers and system designers to generate cost-effective
   maintenance policies. A system level model with explicit accounting of
   all components, interactions and maintenance policy groupings would
   provide the desired accuracy, but the creation of such a model is
   infeasible or very expensive. In this paper; a bottom-up modeling
   procedure that allows for the creation of the maintenance model is
   introduced. This approach reduces the complexity of the modeling process
   while still capturing all the relevant characteristics. Each component
   type present in the system is modeled separately, but each model
   includes an aggregated representation of the effects of the rest of the
   system on the modeled component type. This procedure applied to both a
   midsize-system and to a gas turbine engine. Simulations are used to
   illustrate how the created models are used and to verify the level of
   accuracy by comparing the results to system-level models.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of different flame configurations and heat release
   distributions can exist in high swirl, annular flows. Each of these
   different configurations, in turn, has different thermoacoustic
   sensitivities and influences on combustor emissions, nozzle durability,
   and liner heating. These different configurations arise because at least
   three flame stabilization locations are present, associated with the
   inner and outer shear layers of the annulus, and the stagnation point of
   the vortex breakdown region. This paper focuses on the sensitivities of
   the outer shear layer stabilization point to bulkhead temperature, flow
   velocity, swirl number, preheat temperature, and fuel/air ratio. It also
   characterizes the hysteresis that is present in conditions where the
   outer shear layer locally re-attaches and blows off. The sensitivities
   to bulkhead temperature, preheat temperature and fuel/air ratio follow
   the expected trends. Moreover, the strong bulkhead temperature
   sensitivities show that computations must include heat transfer to
   combustor hardware in order to capture flame stabilization correctly.
   The preheat temperature and fuel/air ratio sensitivities are captured
   with detailed kinetics calculations of the extinction stretch rate of
   the mixture. Somewhat counter intuitively, there is little variation in
   transition conditions with swirl number for the S-m similar to 0.6 and
   0.8 swirlers analyzed here. Finally, velocity sensitivities are in many
   cases much weaker than what would be predicted assuming that the fluid
   mechanic straining time scales as 1/u.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete-event simulation (DES) is used to evaluate alternative resource
   configurations and production operation plans and schedules in the
   manufacturing environment. However, benefits from using simulation to
   guide these decisions has to be weighed against the time and cost
   usually required to create and exercise the simulations. Where such
   decisions are taken frequently, a common practice is to create a
   simulator which accommodates the typical production alternatives, and
   link it to an Excel database for specifying the scenario and displaying
   the simulation results. This is an effective approach when the simulator
   can be reused with sufficient frequency, but it suffers from several
   deficiencies. It can be difficult to maintain the simulator in
   conformance with the actual production capabilities. (changing products,
   changing processes, etc). Knowledge about the production process is
   captured in the simulator and in the Excel-database, neither of which is
   a particularly effective knowledge sharing platform. We propose an
   alternative model-driven approach that automates the creation of DES
   models from SysML models specified using domain-specific semantics. Our
   approach enables domain stakeholders to define the problem in its own
   terms, and eliminates manual simulation model coding. In an industrial
   case study, we have used Arena (TM) as the DES platform and created a
   domain specific language (DSL) for electronics assembly. Not only is
   knowledge about production captured in a form that is accessible by all
   the stakeholders, the time and cost for simulation analysis is reduced
   by an order of magnitude.}},

   The study focused on predicting trips that originated from or terminated

   regression models were compared with regression models based on income,
   because the latter were similar to the regression models currently used
   by the Atlanta Regional Commission to predict home-based airport
   passenger trips. The results provide directional evidence for using
   lifestyle clusters over income groups in predicting airport passenger
   trips. The evidence suggests that alternative data sources with adequate
   information for lifestyle segmentation can improve airport passenger
   models. The discussion points out the need for air passenger surveys to

Abstract = {{Two examples of internally resonating metamaterials with behavior based

   Each patch is shunted through a passive circuit which induces resonance
   in the equivalent mechanical impedance of the waveguide. Analytical,
   numerical and experimental studies illustrate the characteristics of the
   system and quantify such resonant mechanical properties due to
   electro-mechanical coupling. Piezoelectric superlattices are presented
   as additional examples of internally resonant metamaterials. Multi-field
   coupling is identified as the enabler mechanism for the generation of
   the internal resonance. Numerical studies for 1D and 2D piezoelectric
   superlattices and analytical studies developed on the basis of the long
   wavelength approximation support the interpretation of the coupling as
   an internally resonant mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of the extreme-value driving force(s) for surface vs.
   subsurface fatigue crack formation (nucleation and early growth) in
   high-cycle fatigue are evaluated for a microstructure variant of duplex
   Ti-6Al-4V. In polycrystalline metals, previous work has explored
   estimation of the driving force(s) for fatigue crack formation at the
   scale of the grains by computing non-local fatigue indicator parameters
   (FIPs) based on the cyclic plastic strain averaged over domains on the
   length scale of the grains. Instantiated statistical volume elements
   (SVEs), which sample the distributed microstructure attributes of
   interest for a given material system, can be simulated via the finite
   element method with embedded polycrystalline plasticity models to
   estimate the distributed plasticity and resulting FIPs. This strategy of
   simulating multiple SVEs is in contrast to the simulation of a single
   representative volume element which is typically untenably large for
   extreme-value distributions of microstructure attributes or response
   variables. In this work, multiple SVEs are instantiated with both
   traction-free (i.e. surface) boundary conditions and fully periodic
   (i.e. subsurface) boundary conditions. In addition to estimating the
   extreme-value distributions of the FIPs, newly introduced extreme-value
   marked correlation functions are applied to characterize the coupled
   crystallographic microstructure attributes (e.g. grain size, grain
   orientation, grain misorientation) that most influence the extreme-value
   distributions of the FIPs. It is shown that there is overlap in the
   distributions of the driving forces for surface vs. subsurface crack
   formation in the low to moderate range of failure probability based on
   FIPs; however, at higher failure probability levels, the driving forces
   are highest for surface crack formation. The overlap in the
   distributions of the driving forces for fatigue crack formation in the
   low to moderate probability range may assist in describing the competing
   surface vs. subsurface failure modes that are observed experimentally.

Title = {{Derivation of the phase field equations from the thermodynamic extremal

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics employs quantities that characterize the state of the
   system and provides driving forces for system evolution. These
   quantities can be applied by means of the thermodynamic extremal
   principle to obtain models and consequently constitutive equations for
   the evolution of the thermodynamic systems. The phase field method is a
   promising tool for simulation of the microstructure evolution in complex
   systems but introduces several parameters that are not standard in
   thermodynamics. The purpose of this paper is to show how the phase field
   method equations can be derived from the thermodynamic extremal
   principle, allowing the common treatment of the phase field parameters
   together with standard thermodynamic parameters in future applications.
   Fixed values of the phase field parameters may, however, not guarantee
   fixed values of thermodynamic parameters. Conditions are determined, for
   which relatively stable values of the thermodynamic parameters are
   guaranteed during phase field method simulations of interface migration.
   Finally, analytical relations between the thermodynamic and phase field
   parameters are found and verified for these simulations. A slight
   dependence of the thermodynamic parameters on the driving force is
   determined for the cases examined. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

Pages = {{66-73}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Feature detection in sensing problems usually involves two processing
   stages. First, the raw data collected by a sensor, such as a Ground
   Penetrating Radar (GPR), is inverted to form an image of the subsurface
   area. Second, the image is searched for features like lines using an
   algorithm such as the Hough Transform (HT), which converts the problem
   of finding spatially spread patterns in the image space to detecting
   sparse peaks in the HT parameter space. This paper exploits the sparsity
   of features to combine the two stages into one direct processing step
   using Compressive Sensing (CS). The CS framework finds the HT parameters
   directly from the raw sensor measurements without having to construct an
   image of the sensed media. In addition to skipping the image formation
   step, CS processing can be done with a minimal number of raw sensor
   measurements, which decreases the data acquisition cost. The utility of
   this CS-based method is demonstrated for finding buried linear
   structures in both simulated and experimental GPR data. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of estimating the distance to a device
   transmitting in the 2.4 GHz ISM band that is interfering with users of
   an 802.11b wireless network. Accurate estimation of this quantity
   enables the wireless network to dynamically change its operating
   characteristics, such as its transmit power levels and channel
   assignments, to minimize this interference. The estimate is made by a
   cluster of wireless sensor motes deployed along the edge of an 802.11b
   network. The motes perform a 1-bit quantization of the Received Signal
   Strength (RSS) using a dithered quantization framework. The quantized
   bits are transmitted over a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to the
   Cluster Head (CH), which then uses a Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
   technique to estimate the unknown parameter. We propose a framework in
   which the CH uses an iterative parameter estimation scheme in which it
   provides low-overhead feedback to the motes to adjust their threshold
   values for the 1-bit dithered quantization process. Evaluation of the
   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of this iterative scheme shows that it
   performs significantly better than iterative approaches in which all the
   motes use either identical thresholds or the non-identical thresholds
   proposed in Ribeiro and Giannakis (2006) {[}5,19]. Our iterative scheme
   also tracks sudden changes in the distance to the interferer and is
   robust to fluctuations in the crossover probability in the BSC. (C) 2010

Volume = {{61}},

Pages = {{87-100}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Programs written in languages allowing direct access to memory through
   pointers often contain memory-related faults, which cause
   nondeterministic failures and security vulnerabilities. We present a new
   dynamic tainting technique to detect illegal memory accesses. When
   memory is allocated, at runtime, we taint both the memory and the
   corresponding pointer using the same taint mark. Taint marks are then
   propagated and checked every time a memory address m is accessed through
   a pointer p; if the associated taint marks differ, an illegal access is
   reported. To allow always-on checking using a low overhead,
   hardware-assisted implementation, we make several key technical
   decisions. We use a configurable, low number of reusable taint marks
   instead of a unique mark for each allocated area of memory, reducing the
   performance overhead without losing the ability to target most
   memory-related faults. We also define the technique at the binary level,
   which helps handle applications using third-party libraries whose source
   code is unavailable. We created a software-only prototype of our
   technique and simulated a hardware-assisted implementation. Our results
   show that 1) it identifies a large class of memory-related faults, even
   when using only two unique taint marks, and 2) a hardware-assisted
   implementation can achieve performance overheads in single-digit
   percentages.}},

Abstract = {{The drop formation dynamics in the drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet process
   is studied for model inks including a Newtonian liquid and colloidal
   dispersions. The ink shear viscosity is a parameter often adjusted in
   tuning the DOD drop formation process. Apparent shear viscosity measured
   at low shear rates is currently used to characterize inkjet inks
   throughout both the inkjet industry and academia. However, during the
   ejection process in inkjet printing, very high shear rates (above 1 x
   10(5) s(-1)) are involved. In this paper, the drop formation
   characteristics at 10 kHz drop formation rate in a DOD mode of a simple
   Newtonian liquid are compared with those of a colloidal suspension
   system which has the same low-shear-rate viscosity as the simple
   Newtonian liquid, but significantly different high-shear-rate viscosity.
   Under conditions of good jetting, the drop formation dynamics of the
   colloidal suspension is similar to that of the simple Newtonian liquid
   of similar low-shear viscosity, with only slight systematic differences
   observed. Good jetting is, however, difficult to obtain in the colloidal
   particle inks, with non-straight trajectories and non-axisymmetric
   ligaments commonly observed. These observations suggest that
   evaporation, nonuniform wetting, and particle-related changes in
   properties play a role when poor jetting behavior is observed for
   colloidal inks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical N-point correlation functions are used for calculating
   properties of heterogeneous systems. The strength and the main advantage
   of the statistical continuum approach is the direct link to statistical
   information of microstructure. Two-point correlation functions are the
   lowest order of correlation functions that can describe the morphology
   and the microstructure-properties relationship. Experimentally,
   statistical pair correlation functions are obtained using SEM or small
   x-ray scattering techniques. Higher order correlation functions must be
   calculated or measured to increase the precision of the statistical
   continuum approach. To achieve this aim a new approximation methodology
   is utilized to obtain N-point correlation functions for non-FGM
   (functional graded materials) heterogeneous microstructures. Conditional
   probability functions are used to formulate the proposed theoretical
   approximation. In this approximation, weight functions are used to
   connect subsets of (N-1)-point correlation functions to estimate the
   full set of N-point correlation function. For the approximation of three
   and four point correlation functions, simple weight functions have been
   introduced. The results from this new approximation, for three-point
   probability functions, are compared to the real probability functions
   calculated from a computer generated three-phase reconstructed
   microstructure in three-dimensional space. This three-dimensional
   reconstruction was based on an experimental two-dimensional
   microstructure (SEM image) of a three-phase material. This comparison
   proves that our new comprehensive approximation is capable of describing
   higher order statistical correlation functions with the needed accuracy.

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand when stretched, and shrink when compressed.
   This is the result of a negative Poisson's ratio v. Isotropic
   configurations with v approximate to -1 have been designed and are
   expected to provide increased shear stiffness G. This assumes that
   Young's modulus and v can be engineered independently. In this article,
   a micropolar-continuum model is employed to describe the behavior of a
   representative auxetic structural network, the chiral lattice, in an
   attempt to remove the indeterminacy in its constitutive law resulting
   from v = -1. While this indeterminacy is successfully removed, it is
   found that the shear modulus is an independent parameter and, for
   certain configurations, it is equal to that of the triangular lattice.
   This is remarkable as the chiral lattice is subject to bending
   deformation of its internal members, and thus is more compliant than the
   triangular lattice which is stretch dominated. The derived micropolar
   model also indicates that this unique lattice has the highest
   characteristic length scale I of all known lattice topologies, as well
   as a negative first Lame constant without violating bounds required for
   thermodynamic stability. We also find that hexagonal arrangements of
   deformable rings have a coupling number N=1. This is the first lattice
   reported in the literature for which couple-stress or Mindlin theory is
   necessary rather than being adopted a priori. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We present the development and calibration of a macroelement model that
   captures the response of piles in cohesionless soils subjected to
   biaxial lateral loading. The model is founded on actual physical
   mechanism of soil resistance and provides the framework for extending a
   uniaxial model to biaxial case by means of a single cross-stiffness
   parameter. Both upper and lower bounds for the cross-stiffness parameter
   are also presented. The model is calibrated and verified using
   three-dimensional finite element (FE) simulations of soil-pile
   interaction for uniformly prescribed displacement along the pile length.
   Comparison of predictions from uniaxial and biaxial models with the FE
   results for transient loading indicates that the response assuming no
   coupling between the two horizontal directions for biaxial loading can
   differ significantly from the `true' response for some cases. Accounting
   for coupling in the lateral direction, the proposed model captures the
   transverse pile response with very good accuracy while retaining the
   simplicity and computational efficiency of macroelement formulations
   compared to 3D FE analyses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the empirical relationship between site response
   nonlinearity, soil properties, and ground motion characteristics, as a
   first step to enable efficient integration of nonlinear analyses in
   broadband ground motion simulations. For this purpose, we use 24
   downhole array sites with detailed geotechnical information and subject
   the profiles to broadband ground motion synthetics. We quantify the
   extent of soil nonlinearity in site-specific response analyses by
   estimating the divergence between linear and nonlinear ground surface
   predictions. We show that the parameters controlling the nonlinear
   response are V(S30) (weighted averaged shear wave velocity in the top 30
   m of the soil profile), the site amplification at the fundamental
   frequency (Amp), the peak ground acceleration (PGA), and the frequency
   index (FI), a quantitative measure we define to characterize how well
   the incident motion can ``see{''} the near-surface soil layers. Using
   the synthetic results, we quantitatively describe the error introduced
   in ground motion predictions when nonlinear effects are not accounted
   for, and show that the error is both site and ground motion dependent.
   Our study indicates that to characterize the susceptibility of a soil
   profile to nonlinear effects, V(S30) should be complemented with
   measures of the soil-rock impedance contrast, as well as measures of the
   ground motion intensity and frequency content. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Power load has the characteristic of nonlinear fluctuation and random
   growth. Aiming at the drawback that the forecasting accuracy of general
   GM(1,1) model goes down when there is a greater load mutation, this
   paper proposes a new grey model with grey correlation contest for
   short-term power load forecasting. In order to cover the impact of
   various certain and uncertain factors in climate and society on the
   model as fully as possible, original series are selected from different
   viewpoints to construct different forecasting strategies. By making full
   use of the characteristic that GM(1,1) model can give a perfect
   forecasting result in the smooth rise and drop phase of power load, and
   the feature that there are several peaks and valleys within daily power
   load, the predicted day is divided into several smooth segments for
   separate forecasting. Finally, the different forecasting strategies are
   implemented respectively in the different segments through grey
   correlation contest, so as to avoid the error amplification resulted
   from the improper choice of initial condition. A practical application
   verifies that, compared with the existing grey forecasting models, the
   proposed model is a stable and feasible forecasting model with a higher
   forecasting accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an analysis of the unsteady flow field in swirl
   flames subjected to transverse acoustic waves. This work is motivated by
   transverse instabilities in annular gas turbine combustors, which are a
   continuing challenge for both power generation and aircraft
   applications. The unsteady flow field that disturbs the flame consists
   not only of the incident transverse acoustic wave, but also longitudinal
   acoustic fluctuations and vortical fluctuations associated with
   underlying hydrodynamic instabilities of the base flow. We show that the
   acoustic and vortical velocity fluctuations are of comparable magnitude.
   The superposition of these waves leads to strong interference patterns
   in the velocity field, a result of the significantly different wave
   propagation speeds and axial phase dependencies of these two disturbance
   sources. Vortical fluctuations originate from the convectively unstable
   shear layers and absolutely unstable swirling jet. We argue that the
   unsteady shear layer induced fluctuations are the most dynamically
   significant, as they are the primary source of flame fluctuations. We
   also suggest that vortical structures associated with vortex breakdown
   play an important role in controlling the time-averaged features of the
   central flow and flame spreading angle, but do not play an important
   role in disturbing the flame at low disturbance amplitudes. This result
   has important implications not only for our understanding of the
   velocity disturbance field in the flame region, but also for capturing
   important physics in future modeling efforts. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004186]}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a previously developed reconstruction methodology is
   extended to three-dimensional reconstruction of a three-phase

   on hybrid stochastic methodology for simulating the virtual
   microstructure. While different phases of the heterogeneous medium are
   represented by different cells, growth of these cells is controlled by
   optimizing parameters such as rotation, shrinkage, translation,
   distribution and growth rates of the cells. Based on the reconstructed
   microstructure, finite element method (FEM) was used to compute the
   effective elastic modulus and effective thermal conductivity. A
   statistical approach, based on two-point correlation functions, was also
   used to directly estimate the effective properties of the developed
   microstructures. Good agreement between the predicted results from FEM
   analysis and statistical methods was found confirming the efficiency of
   the statistical methods for prediction of thermo-mechanical properties
