Abstract = {{The effects of irradiation by X rays and protons on the dielectric and
   piezoelectric response of highly (100)-textured polycrystalline
   Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O-3 (PZT) thin films have been studied. Low-field dielectric
   permittivity, remanent polarization, and piezoelectric d(33,f) response
   all degraded with exposure to radiation, for doses higher than 300 krad.
   At first approximation, the degradation increased at higher radiation
   doses, and was stronger in samples exposed to X rays, compared to the
   proton-irradiated ones. Nonlinear and high-field dielectric
   characterization suggest a radiation-induced reduction of the extrinsic
   contributions to the response, attributed to increased pinning of the
   domain walls by the radiation-induced point defects. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Prosthetic devices for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
   have been unsuccessful due to mechanical failure or chronic
   inflammation. Polymer hydrogels combine biocompatibility and unique low
   friction properties; however, their prior use for ligament
   reconstruction has been restricted to coatings due to insufficient
   tensile mechanics. Here, we investigate new constructs of polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) hydrogel fibers. In water, these fibers swell to an
   equilibrium water content of 50\% by weight, retaining a tensile modulus
   greater than 40 MPa along the fiber axis at low strain. Rope constructs
   were assembled for ACL replacement and mechanical properties were
   compared with data from the literature. Pure PVA hydrogel constructs
   closely reproduce the non-linear tensile stiffness of the native ACL
   with an ultimate strength of about 2000 N. An additional safety factor
   in tensile strength was achieved with composite braids by adding
   ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers around a core of
   PVA cords. Composition and braiding angle are adjusted to produce a
   non-linear tensile behavior within the range of the native ligament that
   can be predicted by a simple rope model. This design was found to
   sustain over one million cycles between 50 and 450 N with limited damage
   and less than 20\% creep. The promising mechanical performances of these
   systems provide justification for more extensive in vivo evaluation. (C)

Title = {{Sequencing platform and library preparation choices impact viral
   metagenomes}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbes drive the biogeochemistry that fuels the planet.
   Microbial viruses modulate their hosts directly through mortality and
   horizontal gene transfer, and indirectly by re-programming host
   metabolisms during infection. However, our ability to study these
   virus-host interactions is limited by methods that are low-throughput
   and heavily reliant upon the subset of organisms that are in culture.
   One way forward are culture-independent metagenomic approaches, but
   these novel methods are rarely rigorously tested, especially for studies
   of environmental viruses, air microbiomes, extreme environment
   microbiology and other areas with constrained sample amounts. Here we
   perform replicated experiments to evaluate Roche 454, Illumina HiSeq,
   and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing and library preparation protocols on
   virus metagenomes generated from as little as 10pg of DNA.
   Results: Using \%G + C content to compare metagenomes, we find that (i)
   metagenomes are highly replicable, (ii) some treatment effects are
   minimal, e.g., sequencing technology choice has 6-fold less impact than
   varying input DNA amount, and (iii) when restricted to a limited DNA
   concentration (<1 mu g), changing the amount of amplification produces
   little variation. These trends were also observed when examining the
   metagenomes for gene function and assembly performance, although the
   latter more closely aligned to sequencing effort and read length than
   preparation steps tested. Among Illumina library preparation options,
   transposon-based libraries diverged from all others and adaptor ligation
   was a critical step for optimizing sequencing yields.
   Conclusions: These data guide researchers in generating systematic,
   comparative datasets to understand complex ecosystems, and suggest that
   neither varied amplification nor sequencing platforms will deter such
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Amine/silica/polymer composite hollow fiber adsorbents are produced
   using a novel reactive post-spinning infusion technique, and the
   obtained fibers are shown to capture CO2 from simulated flue gas. The
   post-spinning infusion technique allows for functionalization of
   polymer/silica hollow fibers with different types of amines during the
   solvent exchange step after fiber spinning. The post-spinning infusion
   of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) into mesoporous silica/cellulose
   acetate hollow fibers is demonstrated here, and the materials are
   compared with hollow fibers infused with poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). This
   approach results in silica/polymer composite fibers with good amine
   distribution and accessibility, as well as adequate porosity retained
   within the fibers to facilitate rapid mass transfer and adsorption
   kinetics. The CO2 adsorption capacities for the APS-infused hollow
   fibers are shown to be comparable to those of amine powders with similar
   amine loadings. In contrast, fibers that are spun with presynthesized,
   amine-loaded mesoporous silica powders show negligible CO2 uptake and
   low amine loadings because of loss of amines from the silica materials
   during the fiber spinning process. Aminosilica powders are shown to be
   more hydrophilic than the corresponding amine containing composite
   hollow fibers, the bare polymer as well as silica support. Both the
   PEI-infused and APS-infused fibers demonstrate reduced CO2 adsorption
   upon elevating the temperature from 35 to 80 degrees C, in accordance
   with thermodynamics, whereas PEI-infused powders show increased CO2
   uptake over that temperature range because of competing diffusional and
   thermodynamic effects. The CO2 adsorption kinetics as probed via TGA
   show that the APS-infused hollow fiber adsorbents have more rapid uptake
   kinetics than their aminosilica powder analogues. The adsorption
   performance of the functionalized hollow fibers is also assessed in CO2
   breakthrough experiments. The breakthrough results show a sharp CO2
   front for APS-grafted fibers, indicating fast kinetics with comparable
   pseudo-equilibrium capacities to the CO2 equilibrium capacities measured
   via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicate the
   post-spinning infusion method provides a new platform for synthesizing
   composite polymer/silica/amine fibers that may facilitate the ultimate
   scale-up of practical fiber adsorbents for flue gas CO2 capture
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Ionophore antibiotics (IPAs), one of the major groups of pharmaceuticals
   used in livestock industry, have been found to contaminate agricultural
   runoff and surface waters via land application of animal manures as
   fertilizers. However, limited research has investigated the means to
   remove IPAs from water sources. This study investigates the degradation
   of IPAs by using ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and UV combined with
   hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) advanced oxidation process (AOP) under
   low-pressure (LP) UV lamps in various water matrices. Three widely used
   (monensin, salinomycin, and narasin) and one model (nigericin) IPAs
   exhibit low light absorption in the UV range and degrade slowly at the
   light intensity of 3.36 X 10(-6) Einstein.L-1.s(-1) under UV photolysis
   conditions. However, IPAs react with hydroxyl radicals produced by
   UV/H2O2 at fast reaction rates, with second-order reaction rate
   constants at (3.49-4.00) X 10(9) M-1.s(-1) Water matrix constituents
   enhanced the removal of IPAs by UV photolysis but inhibited UV/H2O2
   process. A steady-state kinetic model successfully predicts the impact
   of water constituents on IPA degradation by UV/H2O2 and determines the
   optimal H2O2 dose by considering both energy consumption and IPA
   removal. LC/MS analysis of reaction products reveals the initial
   transformation pathways of IPAs via hydrogen atom abstraction and
   peroxidation during UV/H2O2. This study is among the first to provide a
   comprehensive understanding of the degradation of IPAs via UV/H2O2 AOP.}},

Abstract = {{Variable intensity photoconductivity (PC) performed under vacuum at 325
   nm was used to estimate drift mobility (mu) and density (sigma(s)) of
   negative surface charge for c-axis oriented Si-doped GaN nanowires
   (NWs). In this approach, we assumed that sigma(s) was responsible for
   the equilibrium surface band bending (empty set) and surface depletion
   in the absence of illumination. The NWs were grown by molecular beam
   epitaxy to a length of approximately 10 mu m and exhibited negligible
   taper. The free carrier concentration (N) was separately measured using
   Raman scattering which yielded N = (2.5 +/- 0.3) x 10(17) cm(-3) for the
   growth batch studied under 325 nm excitation. Saturation of the PC was
   interpreted as a flatband condition whereby empty set was eliminated via
   the injection of photogenerated holes. Measurements of dark and
   saturated photocurrents, N, NW dimensions, and dimensional
   uncertainties, were used as input to a temperature-dependent cylindrical
   Poisson equation based model, yielding sigma(s) in the range of (3.5 to
   7.5) x 10(11) cm(-2) and mu in the range of (850 to 2100) cm(2)/(V s)
   across the (75 to 194) nm span of individual NW diameters examined. Data
   illustrating the spectral dependence and polarization dependence of the
   PC are also presented. Back-gating these devices, and devices from other
   growth batches, as field effect transistors (FETs) was found to not be a
   reliable means to estimate transport parameters (e. g., mu and sigma(s))
   due to long-term current drift. The current drift was ascribed to
   screening of the FET back gate by injected positive charge. We describe
   how these gate charging effects can be exploited as a means to hasten
   the otherwise long recovery time of NW devices used as photoconductive
   detectors. Additionally, we present data illustrating comparative drift
   effects under vacuum, room air, and dry air for both back-gated NW FETs
   and top-gated NW MESFETs. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble oligonucleotides are typically introduced to bulk solution to
   promote hybridization activity on DNA-functionalized surfaces. Here, an
   alternative approach is explored by encapsulating secondary target
   strands inside semipermeable colloidal satellite assemblies, then
   triggering their release at 37 degrees C for subsequent surface
   hybridization activity. To prepare DNA-loaded satellite assemblies,
   uniform gelatin microspheres are fabricated using microfluidics, loaded
   with 15 base-long secondary DNA targets, capped with a polyelectrolyte
   bilayer, and finally coated with a monolayer of polystyrene microspheres
   functionalized with duplexes comprised of immobilized probes and
   soluble, 13 base-long hybridization partner strands. Once warmed to 37
   degrees C, secondary DNA targets are released from the gelatin template
   and then competitively displace the shorter, original hybridization
   partners on the polystyrene microspheres.}},

Title = {{Common muscle synergies for balance and walking}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the integration of neural mechanisms for balance
   and locomotion. Muscle synergies have been studied independently in
   standing balance and walking, but not compared. Here, we hypothesized
   that reactive balance and walking are mediated by a common set of
   lower-limb muscle synergies. In humans, we examined muscle activity
   during multidirectional support-surface perturbations during standing
   and walking, as well as unperturbed walking at two speeds. We show that
   most muscle synergies used in perturbations responses during standing
   were also used in perturbation responses during walking, suggesting
   common neural mechanisms for reactive balance across different contexts.
   We also show that most muscle synergies using in reactive balance were
   also used during unperturbed walking, suggesting that neural circuits
   mediating locomotion and reactive balance recruit a common set of muscle
   synergies to achieve task-level goals. Differences in muscle synergies
   across conditions reflected differences in the biomechanical demands of
   the tasks. For example, muscle synergies specific to walking
   perturbations may reflect biomechanical challenges associated with
   single limb stance, and muscle synergies used during sagittal balance
   recovery in standing but not walking were consistent with maintaining
   the different desired center of mass motions in standing vs. walking.
   Thus, muscle synergies specifying spatial organization of muscle
   activation patterns may define a repertoire of biomechanical subtasks
   available to different neural circuits governing walking and reactive
   balance and may be recruited based on task-level goals. Muscle synergy
   analysis may aid in dissociating deficits in spatial vs. temporal
   organization of muscle activity in motor deficits. Muscle synergy
   analysis may also provide a more generalizable assessment of motor
   function by identifying whether common modular mechanisms are impaired
   across the performance of multiple motor tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Highly interconnected silicon nanowires (SiNW) were prepared by a

   lithiation/delithiation was 93.6\% which increased to 99.96\% upon
   cycling. The interconnected nanowire structures assisted in retaining a
   high Coulombic efficiency upon cycling by limiting the loss of active
   material during nanowire fracture and providing shorter/multiple
   electrical paths to the substrate. The performance for repeated shallow

Abstract = {{Acute kidney injury is common in critically ill children, and renal
   replacement therapies provide a life-saving therapy to a subset of these
   children. However, there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved
   device to provide pediatric continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
   Consequently, clinicians adapt approved adult CRRT devices for use in
   children because of lack of safer alternatives. Complications occur
   using adult CRRT devices in children because of inaccurate fluid balance
   (FB) between the volumes of ultrafiltrate (UF) removed and replacement
   fluid (RF) delivered. We demonstrate the design and validation of a
   pediatric fluid management system for obtaining accurate instantaneous
   and cumulative FB. Fluid transport was achieved via multiple novel
   pulsatile diaphragm pumps. The conservation of volume principle
   leveraging the physical property of fluid incompressibility along with
   mechanical coupling via a crankshaft was used for FB. Accuracy testing
   was conducted in vitro for 8 hour long continuous operation of the
   coupled UF and RF pumps. The mean cumulative FB error was <1\% across
   filtration flows from 300 to 3000 ml/hour. This approach of FB control
   in a pediatric-specific CRRT device would represent a significant
   accuracy improvement over currently used clinical implementations.}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1402-1414}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates two-dimensional periodic lattices as a means to
   induce strongly directional stress wave propagation in solids in the
   low-frequency broadband regime. The real 2D structure of the lattice is
   considered as opposed to traditional truss-like approaches, allowing the
   characterization of the system seamlessly between the extremes of
   grid-like systems, porous systems, and a continuum material. Wave
   directionality in structural lattices is associated to their effective
   anisotropic mechanical properties. When the wavelength of deformation is
   larger than the representative unit cell, the system behaves as an
   equivalent medium with orthotropic properties that are correlated to the
   lattice skewness and void volume fraction. Polar plots of wave
   velocities, computed through the application of Bloch's theorem, provide
   insights into the effective anisotropy and wave directionality (or
   ``steering{''}) of the structure. Such directional response is also
   correlated to the stiffness properties of an equivalent medium by means
   of proper homogenization techniques. The effects of the resulting
   anisotropy on wave propagation are also illustrated through wave
   propagation simulations for problems involving both harmonic excitations
   and impulsive loads. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Mobile boom cranes are used throughout the world to perform important
   and dangerous manipulation tasks. The usefulness of these cranes is
   greatly improved if they can utilize their mobile base when they lift
   and transfer a payload. However, crane motion induces payload swing. The
   tip-over stability is degraded by the payload oscillations. This paper
   presents a process for conducting a stability analysis of such cranes.
   As a first step, a static stability analysis is conducted to provide
   basic insights into the effects of the payload weight and crane
   configuration. Then, a semi-dynamic method is used to account for
   payload swing. The results of a full-dynamic stability analysis using a
   multibody simulation of a boom crane are then compared to the outcomes
   of the simpler approaches. The comparison reveals that the simple
   semi-dynamic analysis provides good approximations for the tip-over
   stability properties. The results of the stability analyses are verified
   by experiments. The analysis in this paper provides useful guidance for
   the practical tip-over stability analysis of mobile boom cranes and
   motivates the need to control payload oscillation.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering idea generation plays a vital role in the development of
   novel products. Prior studies have shown that designers fixate to the
   features of example solutions and replicate these features in their
   ideas. This type of fixation acts as a major hindrance in idea
   generation, as it restricts the solution space where designers search
   for their ideas. Building upon the study by Linsey et al. {[}2010, ``A
   Study of Design Fixation, Its Mitigation and Perception in Engineering
   Design Faculty,{''} ASME Trans. J. Mech. Des., 132, 041003], this study
   hypothesizes that designers fixate to example features and this fixation
   can be mitigated using certain defixation materials including alternate
   representations of the design problem. To investigate this, the
   experiment conducted by Linsey et al. {[}2010] with engineering design
   faculty is replicated with novice designers. Participants generate ideas
   for a design problem in three groups: one group working with a fixating
   example, a second group working with the same example along with
   alternate representations of the design problem and a control group. The
   obtained results show that both the novice designers and design faculty
   fixate to the same extent, whereas the defixation materials have
   differential effect on the two groups. This result indicates that design
   researchers need to be very careful in developing methods and guidelines
   that are formulated and tested with studies on novice designers. The
   effectiveness of such measures may vary with the level of expertise of
   the designer.}},

Abstract = {{Existing power system planning software is not capable of simulating
   large numbers of contingencies that involve bus mergers and bus splits
   without cumbersome modifications to planning models either manually or
   through scripting. This means that some of the events that can occur in
   a bulk power system are not studied in detail prior to real-time
   operation. This paper proposes the use of a unified network applications
   framework for planning contingency analysis capable of incorporating
   contingencies that involve arbitrary configurations of switching
   devices. The method handles any type of bus split or bus merger events
   automatically without requiring case conversion or modification. This
   drastically simplifies the tabulation of results of complex
   contingencies and makes potential unsecure system conditions visible
   during the planning stage. The efficiency of the algorithm is
   demonstrated in large-scale ISO models that incorporate full-topology
   switching modeling, and it is shown to be at least ten times faster than
   scripting. The proposed method hence supports direct comparison of
   planning and real-time grid security assessment evaluation, providing
   full temporal interoperability between offline contingency analysis and
   real-time security assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Spin Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is a promising candidate for fast,
   scalable, high-density, nonvolatile memory in nanometer technology.
   However, relatively high write current density and small volume of the
   memory device indicate the possibility of significant self-heating in
   the STTRAM structure. This article performs a critical analysis of the
   self-heating induced temperature variations in STTRAM. We perform a 3D
   finite volume method based study to characterize self-heating effect in
   a single cell. The analysis is extended for STTRAM arrays by developing
   a computationally efficient RC compact model based thermal analyzer. The
   analysis shows that self-heating can results in considerable increase in
   both steady-state value and transient change in temperature of
   individual cells. The effect is less pronounced at the array level and
   depends on the activity level, that is, number of active cells within an
   array size. The analysis further illustrates that self-heating
   negatively impacts electrical reliability metrics namely, read margin
   and detection accuracy; degrades cell performance; and modulates energy
   dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{Lipid droplets (LDs) are the major fat storage organelles in eukaryotic
   cells, but how their size is regulated is unknown. Using genetic screens
   in C. elegans for LD morphology defects in intestinal cells, we found
   that mutations in atlastin, a GTPase required for homotypic fusion of
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, cause not only ER morphology
   defects, but also a reduction in LD size. Similar results were obtained
   after depletion of atlastin or expression of a dominant-negative mutant,
   whereas overexpression of atlastin had the opposite effect. Atlastin
   depletion in Drosophila fat bodies also reduced LD size and decreased
   triglycerides in whole animals, sensitizing them to starvation. In
   mammalian cells, co-overexpression of atlastin-1 and REEP1, a paralog of
   the ER tubule-shaping protein DP1/REEP5, generates large LDs. The effect
   of atlastin-1 on LD size correlates with its activity to promote
   membrane fusion in vitro. Our results indicate that atlastin-mediated
   fusion of ER membranes is important for LD size regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Multispectral imaging has shown promise in subcutaneous vein detection
   and localization in human subjects. While many limitations of
   single-wavelength methods are addressed in multispectral vein detection
   methods, their performance is still limited by artifacts arising from
   background skin reflectance and optimality of postprocessing algorithms.
   We propose a background removal technique that enhances the contrast and

   background from subcutaneous structures in near-infrared images. Results
   are validated by experiments on human subjects. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{The Fokker-Planck equation is widely used to describe the time evolution
   of stochastic systems in drift-diffusion processes. Yet, it does not
   differentiate two types of uncertainties: aleatory uncertainty that is
   inherent randomness and epistemic uncertainty due to lack of perfect
   knowledge. In this paper, a generalized differential Chapman-Kolmogorov
   equation based on a new generalized interval probability theory is
   derived, where epistemic uncertainty is modeled by the generalized
   interval while the aleatory one is by the probability measure. A
   generalized Fokker-Planck equation is proposed to describe
   drift-diffusion processes under both uncertainties. A path integral
   approach is developed to numerically solve the generalized Fokker-Planck
   equation. The resulted interval-valued probability density functions
   rigorously bound the real-valued ones computed from the classical path
   integral method. The method is demonstrated by numerical examples. (c)

Abstract = {{A broadband circularly polarized (CP) antenna is developed with an
   omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane. Four
   broadband CP rectangular loop elements are employed for broadband
   omnidirectional CP radiation. The four rectangular loop elements are
   first printed on a flexible thin dielectric substrate and then rolled
   into a hollow cylinder. A conducting cylinder is introduced inside the
   hollow cylinder for achieving desired omnidirectional CP performance. A
   feeding network consisting of four broadband baluns and an impedance
   matching circuit is designed to feed the four rectangular loop elements.
   The omnidirectional CP antenna has a circular cross section with
   diameter of 0.38 lambda(0). Experimental results show that the
   omnidirectional CP antenna has bandwidths of 41\% (1.65-2.5 GHz) for
   axial ratio dB and 45\% (1.58-2.5 GHz) for return loss > 10 dB. The gain
   variation in the omnidirectional plane is less than 1 dB for the
   frequency range from 1.65 to 2.5 GHz. Good agreement is obtained between

Abstract = {{InN, high indium content InGaN, and Mg-doped InGaN were grown by metal
   modulated epitaxy (MME). Transient reflection high-energy electron
   diffraction intensities were analyzed during the growth of InN and found
   to be similar to that previously reported for GaN and AlN. The x-ray
   diffraction rocking curve and background electron concentration of InN
   grown by MME were found to be respectable in comparison to recent
   reports in literature. InGaN alloys grown by MME were also investigated,
   and a method for detecting indium surface segregation was demonstrated.
   It was found that the shutter modulation scheme could be modified to
   prevent phase separation by indium surface segregation, and a range of
   single-phase InGaN samples with indium contents throughout the
   miscibility gap were grown. Using the discovered method of suppressing
   phase separation, several p-InxGa1-xN samples were grown with indium
   contents from x = 0 to 0.22. A maximum hole concentration of 2.4 x

Title = {{Sliding-Triboelectric Nanogenerators Based on In-Plane Charge-Separation
   Mechanism}},
Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at harvesting ambient mechanical energy for self-powered systems,
   triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been recently developed as a
   highly efficient, cost-effective and robust approach to generate
   electricity from mechanical movements and vibrations on the basis of the
   coupling between triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.
   However, all of the previously demonstrated TENGs are based on vertical
   separation of triboelectric-charged planes, which requires sophisticated
   device structures to ensure enough resilience for the charge separation,
   otherwise there is no output current. In this paper, we demonstrated a
   newly designed TENG based on an in-plane charge separation process using
   the relative sliding between two contacting surfaces. Using Polyamide
   6,6 (Nylon) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films with surface etched
   nanowires, the two polymers at the opposite ends of the triboelectric
   series, the newly invented TENG produces an open-circuit voltage up to
   similar to 1300 V and a short-circuit current density of 4.1 mA/m(2)
   with a peak power density of 5.3 W/m(2), which can be used as a direct
   power source for instantaneously driving hundreds of serially connected
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The working principle and the
   relationships between electrical outputs and the sliding motion are
   fully elaborated and systematically studied, providing a new mode of
   TENGs with diverse applications. Compared to the existing
   vertical-touching based TENGs, this planar-sliding TENG has a high
   efficiency, easy fabrication, and suitability for many types of
   mechanical triggering. Furthermore, with the relationship between the
   electrical output and the sliding motion being calibrated, the
   sliding-based TENG could potentially be used as a self-powered
   displacement/speed/acceleration sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium octahedrons and tetrahedrons enclosed by eight and four
   \{111\} facets have been synthesized from cuboctahedral Pd seeds by
   using Na2PdCl4 and Pd(acac), respectively, as the precursors. Our
   mechanistic studies indicate that the cuboctahedral seeds were directed
   to grow into octahedrons, truncated tetrahedrons, and then tetrahedrons
   when Pd(acac)(2) was used as a precursor. In contrast, the same batch of
   seeds only evolved into octahedrons with increasing sizes when the
   precursor was switched to Na2PdCl4. The difference in growth pattern
   could be attributed to the different reduction rates of these two
   precursors. The fast reduction of Pd(acac)(2) led to a quick drop in
   concentration for the precursor in the very early stage of a synthesis,
   forcing the growth into a kinetically controlled mode. In comparison,
   the slow reduction of Na2PdCl4 could maintain this precursor at a
   relatively high concentration to ensure thermodynamically controlled
   growth. This work not only advances our understanding of the growth
   mechanism of tetrahedrons but also offers a new approach to controlling
   the shape of metal nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{The triboelectric effect is known for many centuries and it is the cause
   of many charging phenomena. However, it has not been utilized for energy
   harvesting until very recently.(1-5) Here we developed a new principle
   of triboelectric generator (TEG) based on a fully contacted, sliding
   electrification process, which lays a fundamentally new mechanism for
   designing universal, high-performance TEGs to harvest diverse forms of
   mechanical energy in our daily life. Relative displacement between two
   sliding surfaces of opposite triboelectric polarities generates
   uncompensated surface triboelectric charges; the corresponding
   polarization created a voltage drop that results in a flow of induced
   electrons between electrodes. Grating of linear rows on the sliding
   surfaces enables substantial enhancements of total charges, output
   current, and current frequency. The TEG was demonstrated to be an
   efficient power source for simultaneously driving a number of small
   electronics. The principle established in this work can be applied to
   TEGs of different configurations that accommodate the needs of
   harvesting energy and/or sensing from diverse mechanical motions, such
   as contacted sliding, lateral translation, and rotation/rolling.}},

Abstract = {{We have extended the ``well-mixed{''} two-particle stochastic models for
   3D Gaussian turbulence to n particles, and have performed calculations
   for clusters of n <= 6 particles. The particle joint motions are
   Gaussian and are constrained by pair-wise spatial correlations. This
   neglects non-Gaussian properties of the two-point velocity distribution
   and also neglects multi-point correlations. It also takes no account of
   intermittency. Although the models do not predict the growth of the
   separation of particles in the cluster satisfactorily, we find that they
   do give a good representation of the shape statistics for the cluster in
   comparison with direct numerical simulation results. We conclude that
   the pair-wise spatial structure of the turbulence accounts for most of
   the observed characteristics of the shape of multi-particle clusters in
   turbulence, and that non-Gaussian and multi-point features of the
   turbulence are of secondary importance. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Coordination of Rapid Sphingolipid Responses to Heat Stress in Yeast}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The regulatory roles of sphingolipids in diverse cell functions have
   been characterized extensively. However, the dynamics and interactions
   among the different sphingolipid species are difficult to assess,
   because de novo biosynthesis, metabolic inter-conversions, and the
   retrieval of sphingolipids from membranes form a complex, highly
   regulated pathway system. Here we analyze the heat stress response of
   this system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate how
   the cell dynamically adjusts its enzyme profile so that it is
   appropriate for operation under stress conditions before changes in gene
   expression become effective. The analysis uses metabolic time series
   data, a complex mathematical model, and a custom-tailored optimization
   strategy. The results demonstrate that all enzyme activities rapidly
   increase in an immediate response to the elevated temperature. After
   just a few minutes, different functional clusters of enzymes follow
   distinct activity patterns. Interestingly, starting after about six
   minutes, both de novo biosynthesis and all exit routes from central
   sphingolipid metabolism become blocked, and the remaining metabolic
   activity consists entirely of an internal redistribution among different
   sphingoid base and ceramide pools. After about 30 minutes, heat stress
   is still in effect and the enzyme activity profile is still
   significantly changed. Importantly, however, the metabolites have
   regained concentrations that are essentially the same as those under
   optimal conditions.}},

Abstract = {{By subjecting DNA aqueous solution to evaporate in a curve-on-flat
   geometry that was composed of either a spherical lens or a cylindrical
   lens situated on a flat substrate, a set of highly aligned DNA nanowires
   in the forms of spokes and parallel stripes over a macroscopic area
   (i.e., millimeter scale) were successfully created. The DNA molecules
   were stretched and aligned on polymer-coated substrate by the receding
   meniscus. The imposed curve-on-flat geometry provided a unique
   environment for controlling the flow within the evaporating solution by
   eliminating temperature gradient and possible convective instability
   and, thus, regulated the formation of DNA nanowires. Such controlled
   evaporative self-assembly is remarkably easy to implement and opens up a
   new avenue for crafting large-scale DNA-based nanostructures in a simple
   and cost-effective manner, dispensing with the need for lithography
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A branched Zno-CdS double-shell NW array on the surface of a carbon
   fiber (CF/ZnO-CdS) was successfully synthesized via a facile two-step
   hydrothermal method. Based on a single CF/ZnO-CdS wire on a polymer
   substrate, a flexible photodetector was fabricated, which exhibited
   ultrahigh photon responsivity under illuminations of blue light (1.11 x
   10(5) A/W, 8.99 x 10(-8) W/cm(2), 480 nm), green light (3.83 x 10(4)
   A/W, 4.48 x 10(-8) W/cm(2), 548 nm), and UV light (1.94 x 10(5) A/W,
   1.59 x 10(-8) W/cm(2), 372 nm), respectively. The responsivity of this
   broadband photon sensor was enhanced further by as much as 60\% when the
   device was subjected to a -0.38\% compressive strain. This is because
   the strain induced a piezopotential in ZnO, which tunes the barrier
   height at the ZnO-CdS heterojunction Interface, leading to an optimized
   optoelectronic performance. This work demonstrates a promising
   application of plezophototronic effect In nanoheterojunction array based
   photon detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical energy harvesting based on triboelectric effect has been
   proven to be a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for electricity
   generation. In this study, we developed a rationally designed
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) by utilizing the contact
   electrification between a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin film and a
   layer of TiO2 nanomaterial (nanowire and nanosheet) array. The
   as-developed TENG was systematically studied and demonstrated as a
   self-powered nanosensor toward catechin detection. The high sensitivity
   (detection limit of 5 mu M) and selectivity are achieved through a
   strong interaction between Ti atoms of TiO2 nanomaterial and enediol
   group of catechin. The output voltage and current density were increased
   by a factor of 5.0 and 2.9, respectively, when adsorbed with catechin of
   a saturated concentration, because of the charge transfer from catechin
   to TiO2. This study demonstrates the possibility of improving the
   electrical output of TENG through chemical modification.}},

Abstract = {{Silver octahedra with edge lengths controlled in the range of 20-72 nm
   were synthesized via seed-mediated growth. The key to the success of
   this synthesis is the use of single-crystal Ag seeds with uniform and

   as a selective capping agent for the \{111\} facets. Our mechanistic
   studies demonstrated that Ag seeds with both cubic and quasi-spherical
   shapes could evolve into octahedra. For the first time, we were able to
   precisely control the edge lengths of Ag octahedra below 100 nm, and the
   lower limit of size could even be pushed down to 20 nm. Using the
   as-obtained Ag octahedra as sacrificial templates, Au nanocages with an
   octahedral shape and precisely tunable optical properties were
   synthesized through a galvanic replacement reaction. Such hollow
   nanostructures are promising candidates for a broad range of
   applications related to optics, catalysis, and biomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{The Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation was performed to evaluate source

   regions, and data assimilation is performed for each region in July 2001
   and January 2002. In addition, two separate scaling factors are
   calculated for weekdays and weekends. Results show that base emissions
   for CO and SO2 sources are relatively accurate. Base emissions for PEC
   source are overestimated 100\%, but those for POA source are
   underestimated up to 70\% when compared with the adjusted emissions.
   Emissions for NH3, NO (x) , and PMFINE sources are relatively accurate
   in July 2001, but those in January 2002 are around 100\% higher than the
   adjusted emissions. Base VOC emissions in July 2001 are similar to the
   adjusted emissions but those in January 2002 are underestimated up to

Abstract = {{The delivery of high quality video to multiple viewers accessing the
   content from various devices and networks with varying conditions is a
   challenging task. Transferring the same content (often with large
   volume) to multiple viewers drives unicast transmission inefficient.
   Furthermore, traditional multicasting is not an optimal solution for
   heterogeneous networks since it either overwhelms slow receivers or
   starves the fast ones. Hence, new delivery solutions with the goal of
   reducing the output rate of the source and tailored to heterogeneous
   networks is necessary. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for
   layered video multicasting to viewers with the flexibility to access the
   content from various devices (in a heterogeneous network) and
   loss/erasure prone networks. In this scheme, the source node uses
   Scalable Video Coding (SVC) to obtain scalability together with modern
   elastic Forward Error Correction (FEC) for loss protection. There exists
   a non-trivial advantage in using elastic FEC in conjunction with SVC
   which enables us to introduce a new architecture that brings
   considerable savings in required source output bandwidth. Our solution
   adapts to the specific needs of viewers, shows resilience against packet
   loss, e. g. less than 5dB drop in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for
   up to 30\% loss rate, and especially, can reduce the source output rate
   by half for typical 3-layer SVC.}},

Abstract = {{Nanogenerators (NGs) have been developed mainly using wurtzite and
   proviskite structured materials. Here, we demonstrate the first
   application of zinc blend structured nanowires (NWs) for NGs, opening a
   new materials system for harvesting mechanical energy. Free-standing
   cadmium telluride (CdTe) micro/nanowires (MW/NWs) were synthesized using
   a facile one-step hydrothermal approach. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   analysis indicates that zinc blende is the major phase compared to
   wurtzite. Laterally packaged single MW generator can generate up to 0.3
   V and 40 nA when a strain is applied on an individual MW. Stability test
   displays its robust piezoelectric performance. Based on these
   characteristics of NG, we have demonstrated that the CdTe nanomaterials
   have potential applications in high-output mechanical energy harvesting.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a unified framework for the Infinitesimal
   Perturbation Analysis (IPA) gradient-estimation technique in the setting
   of marked graphs. It proposes a systematic approach for computing the
   derivatives of sample performance functions with respect to structural
   and control parameters. The resulting algorithms are recursive in both
   time and network flows, and their successive steps are computed in
   response to the occurrence and propagation of certain events in the
   network. Such events correspond to discontinuities in the network
   flow-rates, and their special characteristics are due to the properties
   of continuous transitions and fluid places. Following a general outline
   of the framework we focus on a simple yet canonical example, and
   investigate throughput and workload-related performance criteria as
   functions of structural and control variables. Simulation experiments
   support the analysis and testify to the potential viability of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions are widely held to be the largest
   single source of uncertainty in climate model projections of future
   radiative forcing due to increasing anthropogenic emissions. The
   underlying causes of this uncertainty among modeled predictions of
   climate are the gaps in our fundamental understanding of cloud
   processes. There has been significant progress with both observations
   and models in addressing these important questions but quantifying them
   correctly is nontrivial, thus limiting our ability to represent them in
   global climate models. The Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud
   Experiment (E-PEACE) 2011 was a targeted aircraft campaign with embedded
   modeling studies, using the Center for Interdisciplinary
   Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter aircraft and the
   research vessel Point Sur in July and August 2011 off the central coast
   of California, with a full payload of instruments to measure particle
   and cloud number, mass, composition, and water uptake distributions.
   E-PEACE used three emitted particle sources to separate particle-induced
   feedbacks from dynamical variability, namely 1) shipboard
   smoke-generated particles with 0.05-1-mu m diameters (which produced
   tracks measured by satellite and had drop composition characteristic of
   organic smoke), 2) combustion particles from container ships with
   0.05-0.2-mu m diameters (which were measured in a variety of conditions
   with droplets containing both organic and sulfate components), and 3)
   aircraft-based milled salt particles with 3-5-mu m diameters (which
   showed enhanced drizzle rates in some clouds). The aircraft observations
   were consistent with past large-eddy simulations of deeper clouds in
   ship tracks and aerosol cloud parcel modeling of cloud drop number and
   composition, providing quantitative constraints on aerosol effects on
   warm-cloud microphysics.}},

Abstract = {{Although the processes of haemostasis and thrombosis have been studied
   extensively in the past several decades, much of the effort has been
   spent characterizing the biological and biochemical aspects of clotting.
   More recently, researchers have discovered that the function and
   physiology of blood cells and plasma proteins relevant in haematologic
   processes are mechanically, as well as biologically, regulated. This is
   not entirely surprising considering the extremely dynamic fluidic
   environment that these blood components exist in. Other cells in the
   body such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells have been found to
   biologically respond to their physical and mechanical environments,
   affecting aspects of cellular physiology as diverse as cytoskeletal
   architecture to gene expression to alterations of vital signalling
   pathways. In the circulation, blood cells and plasma proteins are
   constantly exposed to forces while they, in turn, also exert forces to
   regulate clot formation. These mechanical factors lead to biochemical
   and biomechanical changes on the macro- to molecular scale. Likewise,
   biochemical and biomechanical alterations in the microenvironment can
   ultimately impact the mechanical regulation of clot formation. The ways
   in which these factors all balance each other can be the difference
   between haemostasis and thrombosis. Here, we review how the biomechanics
   of blood cells intimately interact with the cellular and molecular
   biology to regulate haemostasis and thrombosis in the context of health
   and disease from the macro- to molecular scale. We will also show how
   these biomechanical forces in the context of haemostasis and thrombosis
   have been replicated or measured in vitro.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the relationship between ports (port demand, port
   supply and value added activity in port) and regional economy from a
   logistics perspective that provided intellectual support for policy
   makers in their strategic port related decisions. The major port cities
   involved in China's five coastal port clusters were taken as the samples
   in order to conform to the development trend of Chinese port cluster. A
   structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed to test a
   hypothesized model concerning ports and their regional economy. Results
   indicated that port supply had a positive effect on port demand. In
   addition, the findings indicated that value added activity in port had a
   positive effect on the development of regional economy. However, port
   supply and port demand were not found to have significantly positive
   effects on regional economy. Theoretical and practical implications of
   the research findings for policy makers are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   the key aspects of thermodynamics, including its fundamental laws. In
   addition, we show that our thermodynamically consistent dynamical system
   model is globally semistable with system states converging to a state of
   temperature equipartition. Furthermore, in the presence of chemical
   reactions, we use the law of mass-action and the notion of chemical
   potential to show that the dynamic system states converge to a state of
   temperature equipartition and zero affinity corresponding to a state of
   chemical equilibrium.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1358-1366}},

Abstract = {{A breakdown of the electrical insulation system can cause catastrophic
   failure of the electrical machine and bring large process downtime
   losses. Preventive maintenance and online monitoring are some of the
   methods to improve reliability and reduce unscheduled downtime. The
   offline surge test is the most commonly used offline test to assess the
   condition of the turn insulation. There is no online monitoring method
   that is applicable to low-voltage machines and has the same capabilities
   as the surge test. This paper shows how to conduct a surge test online
   on 460-V/230-V rated induction machines that are connected in the
   low-voltage configuration. The required hardware, test procedures, and
   evaluation of the results are described. Instead of using a bolted short
   to emulate the insulation breakdown, a new approach is used for the
   experimental validation. The arcing is emulated either by using an
   insulation sample that breaks down at a certain test voltage or by using
   a circuit that emulates the breakdown.}},

Abstract = {{A feedforward transient compensation (FFTC) control scheme with
   proportional-integral-resonant current regulators is proposed to enhance
   the low-voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of doubly fed induction

   Compensation for the DFIG stator transient voltage is feedforward
   injected into both the inner current control loop and the outer power
   control loop. The FFTC current controller improves the transient
   rotor-current control capability and minimizes the DFIG control
   interruptions during both balanced and unbalanced grid faults. Without
   the need of sequence-component decomposition, the torque ripple is
   reduced by injecting 60- and 120-Hz rotor-current components during
   unbalanced stator voltage conditions. The proposed FFTC control
   introduces minimal additional complexity to a regular DFIG
   vector-control scheme and shows promising enhancements in the LVRT
   capability of DFIGs. Simulation and experimental results are presented
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FFTC control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Uniform, dense and continuous coatings of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM)
   have been successfully deposited on dense/porous La0.6Sr0.4CO0
   2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) substrates via a one-step drop-coating process
   using a water-based solution in order to improve the operating stability
   of solid oxide fuel cell cathode. The processing conditions were
   optimized by precise control of the composition of infiltrating
   solution, including chelating agents (glycine, citric acid and ethylene
   glycol), surfactants (polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)) and pH values (5.25, 4.29, 3.01 and
   2.09). Ethanol was found to improve the wetting ability of the
   water-based solution significantly, but unfortunately causing
   precipitation. The symmetrical and full cells tests demonstrated that
   both performance and stability of LSCF cathode can be enhanced by
   surface modification with an optimized LSM film coating, leading to
   similar to 31\% reduction in cathodic polarization resistance and
   similar to 45\% improvement in power density (without observable

Abstract = {{Lithium alloys with metallic or semi-metallic elements are attractive
   candidate materials for the next-generation high-capacity rechargeable
   Li-ion battery anodes, due to their large specific and volumetric
   capacities. The key challenge in the application of these materials has
   been the very large volume changes, and the associated stress buildup
   and failure during insertion and extraction of lithium. While such
   stress buildup bears resemblance to the process of thermo-stress
   development, a phenomenon relatively well-understood, the physics
   involved in these alloy-based electrodes is much more complex in nature,
   more challenging to address, and richer in the variety of influencing
   factors. The reasons not only lie in the fact that the mechanical
   deformations are much larger, but also arise from the fact that the
   processes entail interactions among mass diffusion, chemical reactions,
   non-linear plastic flow and material property evolutions. In this paper,
   we present a review of some of the fundamental issues and the latest
   research related to the mechanical reliability of such alloy-based anode
   materials, with a focus on Li/Si, a material with the highest known
   theoretical energy storage capacity. The review primarily concerns
   continuum-level analyses, with relevant experimental data and
   atomistic-level results as input.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the synthesis of optimal liveness-enforcing control
   policies for Gadara nets, a special class of Petri nets that arises in
   the modeling of the execution of multithreaded computer programs for the
   purpose of deadlock avoidance. We consider maximal permissiveness as the
   notion of optimality. Deadlock-freeness of a multithreaded program
   corresponds to liveness of its Gadara net model. We present a new
   control synthesis algorithm for liveness enforcement of Gadara nets that
   need not be ordinary. The algorithm employs structural analysis of the
   net and synthesizes monitor places to prevent the formation of a special
   class of siphons, termed resource-induced deadly-marked siphons. The
   algorithm also accounts for uncontrollable transitions in the net in a
   minimally restrictive manner. The algorithm is generally an iterative
   process and converges in a finite number of iterations. It exploits a
   covering of the unsafe states that is updated at each iteration. The
   proposed algorithm is shown to be correct and maximally permissive with
   respect to the goal of liveness enforcement.}},

Abstract = {{3-D technologies with stacked chips have the potential to provide new
   chip architecture, and improved device density, performance, efficiency,
   and bandwidth. The increased power density in 3-D technologies can
   become a daunting challenge for heat removal. Furthermore, power density
   can be highly nonuniform, leading to time-and space-varying hotspots,
   which can severely affect performance and reliability of integrated
   circuits. It is important to mitigate on-chip thermal gradients while
   considering the associated cooling costs. One efficient method of
   hotspot thermal management is to use superlattice thermoelectric coolers
   (TECs), which can provide on demand and localized cooling. In this
   paper, a detailed 3-D thermal model of a stacked electronic package with
   two dies and four ultrathin integrated TECs is developed to investigate
   the efficacy of TECs in hotspot cooling for 3-D technology. A strong
   vertical coupling has been observed between TECs located in top and
   bottom dies. Bottom TECs can significantly heat the top hotspots in both
   steady-state and transient operation. TECs need to be carefully placed
   inside the package to avoid such undesired heating. Thermal contact
   resistances between dies, inside the TEC module, and between TEC and
   heat spreader are shown to have a crucial effect on the TEC performance.
   We observe up to 5.6 degrees C of active hotspot cooling in steady state
   and 7.4 degrees C of active hotspot cooling using a square root current
   pulse.}},

Title = {{Modeling Strategies for Air Flow Through Perforated Tiles in a Data

Abstract = {{Raised-floor data centers supply cold air to server racks through
   perforated tiles; hence, designing an efficient air delivery scheme
   requires better understanding of flow features through the tiles.
   Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been established as an important
   tool for examining the overall flow fields in data centers. The
   generally used model for air flow through the perforated tiles, the
   porous jump model, specifies a step pressure loss across the tile
   surface without affecting the velocity field across the tile. A recently
   proposed improvement in the porous jump model, the body force model,
   includes an additional momentum source above the tile surface to account
   for the acceleration of the flow through the pores. In both these
   models, geometrical details of the tile such as pore size, location, and
   shape are not included, which results in a significantly lower
   computational effort. However, to improve the solution accuracy, it is
   important to consider the geometrical details due to complex flow
   behavior through the tiles, such as flow acceleration through pores,
   jet-jet interactions, and downstream flow development, which simplified
   models may fail to capture. In this paper, we present a systematic
   approach to perforated tile flow modeling, with focus on consideration
   of geometrical details of the tile. First, different turbulence models
   are compared for the prediction of flow field through a sharp-edged
   orifice that is representative of a single pore of the tile. Comparison
   with the published experimental results suggests that a realizable
   k-epsilon model is more appropriate for modeling flow through pores, as
   compared to the generally used standard k-epsilon model. Flow
   characteristics through a single pore are analyzed next, and the balance
   between solution accuracy and grid coarsening is discussed.
   Subsequently, a full-scale tile model is presented, and it is observed
   that the elimination of plenum from the model significantly alters the
   flow field prediction. Body force model is compared with the full-scale
   tile model, and it shows promise for capturing the major features of
   flow-through tiles, with scope for further improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the fundamental sensitivity of oscillator-based
   reactance sensors, which are widely used in numerous types of biomedical
   sensing applications. We first show that the intrinsic sensitivity is
   limited by the phase noise of the sensing oscillators. To achieve sensor
   detection sensitivity below this limit, a correlated double counting
   (CDC) noise suppression scheme is proposed to cancel the correlated
   phase noise in differential frequency detections. The suppression effect
   of the CDC scheme is thoroughly modeled. Moreover, the CDC scheme is
   extended to a high-order configuration, called the Interleaving-NCDC, to
   further improve the frequency resolution. In addition, we show that the
   weighting sequence on the Interleaving-N CDC data can be optimized as a
   digital noise filter to maximize the noise suppression. Given a sensing
   oscillator with any phase-noise profile, a general weighting
   optimization method is proposed based on the minimum variance distortion
   less response. As an example, an oscillator-based inductive magnetic
   sensor array in a 45-nm CMOS silicon-on-insulator process is implemented
   with the proposed CDC scheme. It achieves a noise suppression of 10.4 dB
   with basic CDC sheme and a frequency resolution of 0.128 parts
   permillion for Interleaving-N CDC scheme, both with negligible power
   overhead. This enables inductance-change detection sensitivity of 0.41
   fH for a low-on-chip 1.6-nH inductor with a quality factor of only 4.95.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of transforming aeroelastic vibrations into electricity for
   low-power generation has received growing attention in the last few
   years. The goal is to convert airflow energy into electricity for
   powering small electronic components employed in wireless applications.
   The potential applications for aeroelastic energy harvesting range from
   aircraft structures to several engineering problems involving wireless
   electronic components located in high wind areas. The use of a typical
   airfoil section is a convenient approach to create instabilities and
   persistent oscillations in aeroelastic energy harvesting. This article
   analyzes two airfoil-based aeroelastic energy harvesters using (a)
   piezoelectric transduction and (b) electromagnetic induction. An airfoil
   with two degrees of freedom is investigated by adding piezoelectric and
   electromagnetic couplings to the plunge degree of freedom in two
   separate cases. The governing dimensionless electroaeroelastic equations
   are given in each case with a resistive load in the electrical domain
   for predicting the power output at the flutter boundary. The effects of
   several dimensionless system parameters on the dimensionless electrical
   power output as well as the dimensionless linear flutter speed are
   investigated for piezoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesting
   from airflow-induced vibrations. The simulations presented in this study
   can be employed for designing and optimizing airfoil-based wind energy
   harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anode temperature on the performance of a 4.5 kW
   Hall-effect thruster are investigated. The approach separates the
   location of gas injection from discharge current collection using an
   anode band, which removes the main mechanism that heats the gas
   distributor. A thermal model predicts a 270 K reduction of the gas
   distributor temperature, which corresponds to a 28\% increase in the
   propellant residence time. Collection of the discharge current on the
   anode band, which is upstream of the bulk Hall current region, generates
   a 10\% increase in ion current density at the thruster centerline for
   discharge voltages of 100, 125, and 150 Vat a xenon mass flow rate of 5
   mg/s. The initial reduction in neutral velocity with the anode band is
   counteracted by the influence of the channel wall temperature, which
   increases the neutral velocity of the particles by up to 25\% greater
   than the velocity at the gas distributor exit plane. This reduces the
   potential thruster efficiency improvement from 5.5 to 2.5\%. The
   selected downstream location of the anode band results in a 6-10\%
   increase in discharge current compared with current collection on the

Abstract = {{The expansion of neutral gas in an open-ended cylindrical chamber into a
   large vacuum facility is investigated to understand neutral particle
   density distribution. The cylindrical chamber geometry with a single
   on-axis gas injection port is representative of a helicon plasma source

   0-200 sccm, at facility pressures up to 3 x 10(-5) and 3.8 x 10(-5) torr
   Ar and torr Xe, respectively. The average relative error between the
   experimentally measured pressure profiles and the numerical results
   obtained with a direct simulation Monte Carlo code is less than 10\%,
   with the maximum relative error below 30\%. The single on-axis injection
   port into the cylindrical discharge chamber results in a nonuniform
   neutral particle density distribution in the source due to the
   recirculation zone generated in the rear of the discharge chamber. This
   highlights the potential impact of the propellant injection system

Abstract = {{A detailed theoretical/numerical framework is established to study the
   mechanical erosion of graphite-nozzle materials in solid rocket motors
   with aluminized ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene
   composite propellants. The analysis is based on a combined
   Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for treating multiphase motor flowfields.
   The multicomponent reacting gas-phase dynamics is formulated using the
   conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy in the Eulerian
   framework. Turbulence closure is achieved using the standard k-epsilon
   two-equation model. The dispersed phase, consisting of aluminum and
   alumina droplets, is treated in the Lagrangian framework. Combustion of
   aluminum droplets to aluminum-oxide smoke is considered. Two empirical
   correlations are first calibrated and then employed to predict the
   mechanical-erosion rate of the nozzle surface. The estimated erosion
   rates fall within the range of the available experimental data.
   Mechanical erosion is prevalent in the convergent section of the rocket
   nozzle due to the particle impingement on the nozzle surface. No such
   erosion, however, is observed at the nozzle throat or downstream because
   the droplet trajectories move away from the nozzle surface in those

   Disruption Risks}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Ports-of-entry are critical components of the modern international
   supply chain infrastructure, particularly container seaports and
   airfreight hubs. The potential operational and economic impact resulting
   from their temporary closure is unknown but is widely believed to be
   very significant. This paper investigates one aspect of this potential
   impact, focusing specifically on the use of supply chain inventory as a
   risk mitigation strategy for a one supplier, one customer system in
   which goods are transported through a port-of-entry subject to temporary
   closures. Closure likelihood and duration are modeled using a completely
   observed, exogenous Markov chain. Order lead times are dependent on the
   status of the port-of-entry, including potential congestion backlogs of
   unprocessed work. An infinite-horizon, periodic-review inventory control
   model is developed to determine the optimal average cost ordering
   policies under linear ordering costs with backlogged demand. When
   congestion is negligible, the optimal policy is state invariant. In the
   more complex case of nonnegligible congestion, this result no longer
   holds. For studied scenarios, numerical results indicate that operating
   margins may decrease 10\% for reasonable-length port-of-entry closures,
   that margins may be eliminated completely without contingency plans, and
   that expected holding and penalty costs may increase 20\% for
   anticipated increases in port-of-entry utilization.}},

Title = {{Bid Prices When Demand Is a Mix of Individual and Batch Bookings}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{198-213}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Industries such as aviation, hospitality, and package tours often face
   both individual and batch bookings, requiring one unit and multiple
   units of capacity, respectively. Using bid prices is a common practice
   in accepting or rejecting an incoming booking (or equivalently, deciding
   which price bucket to offer to the incoming bookings at a given time).
   Most of the literature and existing applications for making
   accept/reject decisions model the arrival stream as individual bookings.
   In this paper, we propose an effective approach to determine bid prices
   when there is a mixed demand pattern with individual and batch bookings.
   We propose decomposing the demand into ``small{''} and ``large{''}
   bookings, using dynamic programming for large bookings, and a fast,
   high-quality approximation for small bookings. We present an application
   of our approach in the air cargo industry, where cargo is often
   separated into two categories, namely, mail and packages (small cargo)
   and freight (large cargo). To obtain bid prices for small cargo, we
   approximate cargo booking requests with passenger arrival models and
   develop an efficient and effective algorithm to solve the probabilistic
   nonlinear formulation of the seat allocation problem from the passenger
   literature. To obtain bid prices for large cargo, we solve a dynamic
   program decomposed by flight leg, which is tractable due to the
   scattered arrivals and large sizes of the bookings. Our approach leads
   to a significant potential increase in revenues compared to the
   first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach and the solution from the
   deterministic formulation (DIP), two methods commonly used in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein found in
   abundance in atherosclerotic plaques. Angiotensin II (Ang II) promotes
   atherosclerosis by inducing adhesion and migration of vascular smooth
   muscle cells (VSMCs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of
   protein expression. However, the relationship between Ang II, miRNAs and
   OPN has yet to be fully explored.
   Methods and results: Using cultured VSMCs, we found that Ang II
   increased cellular OPN protein expression 4 h after treatment by 420 +/-
   54\% (p < 0.03) in a translation dependent manner. Sequence analysis
   revealed a putative binding site for mir181a and raised the possibility
   that miR181a is a potential regulatory mechanism for OPN expression. We
   demonstrated that Ang II decreased miR181a expression by 52 +/- 7\% (p <
   0.0001) and overexpressing miR181a inhibited Ang II induced increases in
   OPN protein expression by 69 +/- 9\% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we
   demonstrated that miR181a is functionally important in that
   overexpression of miR181a inhibited VSMCs adhesion to collagen in
   response to Ang II as compared to controls by 36 +/- 4\%. (p < 0.05)
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that miR181a regulates OPN
   expression and that altering miR181a expression may be a novel
   therapeutic approach to modulate OPN protein expression. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors can measure
   object-specific signatures that can be used to discriminate landmines
   from harmless clutter. In a model-based signal processing paradigm, the
   object signatures can often be decomposed into a weighted sum of
   parameterized basis functions, such as the discrete spectrum of
   relaxation frequencies (DSRF), where the basis functions are intrinsic
   to the object under consideration and the associated weights are a
   function of the target-sensor orientation. The basis function parameters
   can then be used as features for classifying the target. One of the
   challenges associated with effectively utilizing a model-based signal
   processing paradigm such as this is determining the correct model order
   for the measured data, as the number of basis functions containing
   fundamental information regarding the target under consideration is not
   known a priori. In this paper, sparse Bayesian relevance vector machine
   (RVM) regression is applied to simultaneously determine both the number
   of parameterized basis functions and their relative contributions to the
   measured signal assuming a DSRF signal model. The target is then
   classified utilizing the basis function parameters as features within a
   statistical classifier. Results for data measured with a prototype
   frequency-domain EMI sensor at a standardized test site are presented,
   and indicate that RVM regression followed by distance-based statistical
   classifiers utilizing the resulting model-based features provides an
   effective approach for classifying and identifying landmine targets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for the energy-optimal operation of a
   fixed-wing aircraft tracking a prescribed landing path in the
   three-dimensional space with a fixed time of arrival. The problem is
   converted to an optimal control problem with one state variable, which
   is subject to state and control input constraints along the path. It is
   shown that the solution to this energy-optimal tracking problem provides
   a good approximation to the minimum-fuel problem. The switching
   structure of the optimal solution is analyzed, and a semi-analytical
   method is proposed for computing the optimal solution. Compared to
   standard numerical optimization methods the proposed method is
   guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution, and it is
   computationally much more efficient. Numerical examples are presented to
   demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. As verified by these
   numerical results the proposed energy-optimal solution can help improve
   aircraft fuel efficiency during the landing phase.}},

Abstract = {{To drive the application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
   mapping in ex vivo diagnostic imaging and non-biological material
   characterization, we have designed a robust and accurate multiplex
   spectral fitting method using an alternating minimization algorithm to
   extract individual constituent Raman spectra with very small overall
   fitting error (as low as 2\%). For each mixed Raman signal, constituent
   spectra and mixture coefficients were estimated jointly based on
   reference spectra that were measured in the lab. Our method is based on
   a Poisson model to reflect the photon counting nature of Raman signals
   and includes the nonlinear noise in the measured data, making our method
   robust against data containing relatively large random noise. In our
   method, we minimized a cost function consisting of two terms: (1) the
   overall fitting error between the measured and modeled spectra and (2)
   the sum of the individual error between each reference spectrum and its
   corresponding constituent. This method inherently guarantees that the
   estimates will approach the global minimum with monotonic convergence.
   The accuracy of our method was validated by applying it to a SERS
   spectral fitting problem and comparing our results to those from
   existing methods. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Several years ago, the ``neurochemical mobile{''} was introduced as a
   visual tool for explaining the different balances between
   neurotransmitters in the brain and their role in mental disorders. Here
   we complement this concept with a non-linear computational systems model
   representing the direct and indirect interactions between
   neurotransmitters, as they have been described in the ``neurochemical
   interaction matrix.{''} The model is constructed within the framework of
   biochemical systems theory, which facilitates the mapping of numerically
   ill-characterized systems into a mathematical and computational
   construct that permits a variety of analyses. Simulations show how
   short-and long-term perturbations in any of the neurotransmitters
   migrate through the entire system, thereby affecting the balances within
   the mobile. In cases of short-term alterations, transients are of
   particular interest, whereas long-term changes shed light on
   persistently altered, allostatic states, which in mental diseases and
   sleep disorders could be due to a combination of unfavorable factors,
   resulting from a specific genetic predisposition, epigenetic effects,
   disease, or the repeated use of drugs, such as opioids and amphetamines.}},

Title = {{Reaction pathways over copper and cerium oxide catalysts for direct
   synthesis of imines from amines under aerobic conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{116-124}},

Abstract = {{Copper(II) oxide, cerium oxide, and several copper(II) oxide supported
   on cerium oxide catalysts are explored in the aerobic oxidative
   homocoupling of benzylamine to form N-benzylidenebenzylamine in DMSO at
   110 degrees C. Although both CuO and CeO2 alone are shown to catalyze
   the reaction, CuO-CeO2 catalysts are shown to most efficiently catalyze
   the reaction, providing higher rates (per g Cu) due to the presence of
   both copper and ceria species in the reactor. Catalysts with lower
   copper loadings and increased ceria content reduce the product yield, as
   ceria domains can catalyze the decomposition of the desired product as
   well. The amine conversion occurs with a significant induction period,
   associated with the putative formation of an initial benzylimine
   intermediate in the case of catalysis with CeO2 alone or from slow
   copper solubilization in cases where supported or unsupported copper
   catalysts are used, followed by rapid conversion to the
   N-benzylidenebenzylamine product. Copper leaching studies clearly
   demonstrate that catalysis using copper-containing catalysts is
   primarily associated with turnover by soluble copper species. A series
   of experiments targeted at elucidating the reaction pathway suggests
   that copper oxide domains promote the coupling of the initial
   intermediate, benzylimine, with benzylamine to produce the
   N-benzylidenebenzylamine product (path A), with a maximum production
   rate of 888 mu mol/m(2) h (13.3 mmol/gCu h) over the pure CuO catalyst
   or 22.9 mu mol/m(2) h (26.1 mmol/gCu h) over the CuO-CeO2 catalyst. In
   contrast, cerium oxide domains are suggested to primarily convert the
   benzylimine to benzaldehyde, followed by condensation of the
   benzaldehyde with benzylamine in a rapid step to yield the
   N-benzylidenebenzylamine product (path B), with a maximum amine
   production rate of 2.74 mu mol/m(2) h. Both ceria and copper(II) oxide
   domains promote the initial benzylimine formation at comparable rates.
   Although the CuO-CeO2 catalyst leaches about 11\% of the copper during
   the reaction, and these soluble copper species are largely responsible
   for the catalytic turnover, the recovered solid can be recycled until
   the copper is depleted, catalyzing the reaction with an identical rate
   per g Cu in a second cycle, after calcination. The copper-ceria family
   of catalysts offers an alternative, potentially lower cost composition
   for the target oxidative homocoupling reaction than previously studied
   precious metal catalysts, although copper leaching is a distinct
   drawback to the catalyst composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper systematically investigates the self-collimation behavior in
   silicon-based triangular-lattice annular photonic crystals (PCs). It is
   found that, in comparison with normal air-hole PCs, annular PCs more
   easily suppress the separation between TE-2 and TM-2 bands along the
   Gamma-M direction by increasing the inner radius of annular air rings.
   Such a feature is quite beneficial in the formation of a flat
   equi-frequency contour for both polarizations at the same frequency,
   which means a polarization-insensitive self-collimation (PISC) effect.
   Further analysis has shown that, to support PISC, the minimum ratio
   between the inner and outer radii of annular air rings will gradually
   increase as the outer radius changes from 0.25 alpha to 0.49 alpha. When
   the ratio is fixed, the annular air rings with larger outer radius will
   provide wider common frequency area to realize PISC. We have also
   investigated the transmission feature for different annular PCs and
   chosen an optimal structure to illustrate the PISC effect. Finally, a
   polarization beam splitter has been proposed and demonstrated based on
   the unique PISC and band-gap feature in triangular-lattice annular PCs.

Abstract = {{Following the springtime polar sunrise, ozone concentrations in the
   lower troposphere episodically decline to near-zero levels(1). These
   ozone depletion events are initiated by an increase in reactive bromine
   levels in the atmosphere(2-5). Under these conditions, the oxidative
   capacity of the Arctic troposphere is altered, leading to the removal of
   numerous transported trace gas pollutants, including mercury(6).
   However, the sources and mechanisms leading to increased atmospheric
   reactive bromine levels have remained uncertain, limiting simulations of
   Arctic atmospheric chemistry with the rapidly transforming sea-ice
   landscape(7,8). Here, we examine the potential for molecular bromine
   production in various samples of saline snow and sea ice, in the
   presence and absence of sunlight and ozone, in an outdoor snow chamber
   in Alaska. Molecular bromine was detected only on exposure of surface
   snow ( collected above tundra and first-year sea ice) to sunlight. This
   suggests that the oxidation of bromide is facilitated by a photochemical
   mechanism, which was most efficient for more acidic samples
   characterized by enhanced bromide to chloride ratios. Molecular bromine
   concentrations increased significantly when the snow was exposed to
   ozone, consistent with an interstitial air amplification mechanism.
   Aircraft-based observations confirm that bromine oxide levels were
   enhanced near the snow surface. We suggest that the photochemical
   production of molecular bromine in surface snow serves as a major source
   of reactive bromine, which leads to the episodic depletion of
   tropospheric ozone in the Arctic springtime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of fracture strength of multicrystalline
   silicon (mc-Si) solar wafers produced by slurry and diamond wire sawing.
   The wafers were bent in two orthogonal orientations relative to the saw
   marks. The fracture strength of slurry sawn wafers increases gradually
   from wire entry to wire exit whereas the strength variation in the wire
   feed direction is small. The fracture strength of diamond wire sawn
   wafers is bi-directional, with a higher strength if bent perpendicular
   to the saw marks and a lower strength if bent parallel to the saw marks.
   The fracture strength variation is related to the microcracks generated
   in the vicinity of grit-induced surface damage.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we achieved the efficient synthesis of
   2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G) from soluble starch by
   fusing a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) from Alkalimonas amylolytica
   alpha-amylase (CBMAmy) to cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from
   Paenibacillus macerans. One fusion enzyme, CGT-CBMAmy, was constructed
   by fusing the CBMAmy to the C-terminal region of CGTase, and the other
   fusion enzyme, CGT Delta E-CBMAmy, was obtained by replacing the E
   domain of CGTase with CBMAmy. The two fusion enzymes were then used to
   synthesize AA-2G from soluble starch as a cheap and easily soluble
   glycosyl donor. Under the optimal conditions, the AA-2G yields produced
   using CGT Delta E-CBMAmy and CGT-CBMAmy were 2.01 g/liter and 3.03
   g/liter, respectively, which were 3.94- and 5.94-fold of the yield from
   the wild-type CGTase (0.51 g/liter). The reaction kinetics of the two
   fusion enzymes were analyzed and modeled to confirm the enhanced
   specificity toward soluble starch. It was also found that, compared to
   the wild-type CGTase, the two fusion enzymes had relatively high
   hydrolysis and disproportionation activities, factors that favor AA-2G
   synthesis. Finally, it was speculated that the enhancement of soluble
   starch specificity may be related to the changes of substrate binding
   ability and the substrate binding sites between the CBM and the starch
   granule.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates by means of several large eddy simulations how
   the channel aspect ratio affects the transport and settling of suspended
   sediments. The numerical method is successfully validated using data of
   a physical experiment of fine sediment net deposition in an open channel
   flow. The channel aspect ratio, A, is known to be the determining factor
   for the development, strength and distribution of the turbulence-driven
   secondary flow, and it is demonstrated that A influences the primary
   flow, turbulence quantities and the transport and fate of fine
   sediments. The secondary flow locally supports or hinders the falling of
   fine sediment particles in a turbulent flow, which results in a
   non-uniform deposition of fine sediments over the cross-section. While
   the channel aspect ratio has a large influence on the distribution of
   suspended sediments within the cross-section, its effect on the
   cross-sectional averaged deposition is negligibly small. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency (EE) has caught more and more attention in future
   wireless communications due to steadily rising energy costs and
   environmental concerns. In this paper, we propose an EE scheme with
   proportional fairness for the downlink multiuser distributed antenna
   systems (DAS). Our aim is to maximize EE, subject to constraints on
   overall transmit power of each remote access unit (RAU), bit-error rate
   (BER), and proportional data rates. We exploit multi-criteria
   optimization method to systematically investigate the relationship
   between EE and spectral efficiency (SE). Using the weighted sum method,
   we first convert the multi-criteria optimization problem, which is
   extremely complex, into a simpler single objective optimization problem.
   Then an optimal algorithm is developed to allocate the available power
   to balance the tradeoff between EE and SE. We also demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme and illustrate the fundamental
   tradeoff between energy-and spectral-efficient transmission through
   computer simulation.}},

   effect on the quality of 3-D integrated chips (ICs). Whereas
   well-managed TSVs alleviate routing congestion and reduce wirelength,
   excessive or ill-managed TSVs increase the die area and wirelength. In
   this paper, we investigate the impact of the TSV on the quality of 3-D
   IC layouts. Two design schemes, namely TSV co-placement (irregular TSV
   placement) and TSV site (regular TSV placement), and accompanying
   algorithms to find and optimize locations of gates and TSVs are proposed
   for the design of 3-D ICs. Two TSV assignment algorithms are also
   proposed to enable the regular TSV placement. Simulation results show
   that the wirelength of 3-D ICs is shorter than that of 2-D ICs by up to
   25\%.}},

Abstract = {{Wideband electromagnetic induction systems have shown improved false

   of these sensors and the development of algorithms for target

   In this paper, simple wideband models of the eddy current response for a
   wire and disk are provided. These are provided in the form of a
   singularity expansion of the polarizability dyadic. In an effort to make
   this form more concrete, a major focus of the paper is on relating the
   terms of the expansion to graphs of the currents present on the disk.
   The models provided in the paper are based on limiting forms of a
   cylinder as computed using the body-of-revolutions finite element
   method. Measured polarizability dyadics are also shown to fit the forms
   provided reasonably well. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The field of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has enjoyed more than 30
   years of technology advances due to the extensive utilization of the
   hidden Markov model (HMM) framework and a concentrated effort by the
   speech community to make available a vast amount of speech and language
   resources, known today as the Big Data Paradigm. State-of-the-art ASR
   systems achieve a high recognition accuracy for well-formed utterances
   of a variety of languages by decoding speech into the most likely
   sequence of words among all possible sentences represented by a
   finite-state network (FSN) approximation of all the knowledge sources
   required by the ASR task. However, the ASR problem is still far from
   being solved because not all information available in the speech
   knowledge hierarchy can be directly integrated into the FSN to improve
   the ASR performance and enhance system robustness. It is believed that
   some of the current issues of integrating various knowledge sources in
   top-down integrated search can be partially addressed by processing
   techniques that take advantage of the full set of acoustic and language
   information in speech. It has long been postulated that human speech
   recognition (HSR) determines the linguistic identity of a sound based on
   detected evidence that exists at various levels of the speech knowledge
   hierarchy, ranging from acoustic phonetics to syntax and semantics. This
   calls for a bottom-up attribute detection and knowledge integration
   framework that links speech processing with information extraction, by
   spotting speech cues with a bank of attribute detectors, weighting and
   combining acoustic evidence to form cognitive hypotheses, and verifying
   these theories until a consistent recognition decision can be reached.
   The recently proposed automatic speech attribute transcription (ASAT)
   framework is an attempt to mimic some HSR capabilities with asynchronous
   speech event detection followed by bottom-up knowledge integration and
   verification. In the last few years, ASAT has demonstrated good
   potential and has been applied to a variety of existing applications in
   speech processing and information extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Screen-printed metal contact formation through a carbon containing
   antireflection coating was investigated for silicon solar cells by
   fabricating conventional carbon-free SiNx and carbon-rich SiCxNy film.
   An appreciable difference was found in the average shunt resistance
   (Rsh), which was about an order of magnitude higher for SiCxNy-coated
   solar cells relative to the counterpart SiNx-coated solar cells. Series
   resistance (Rs) and fill factor (FF) were comparable for both
   antireflection coatings but the starting efficiency of SiCxNy-coated
   cell was similar to 0 center dot 2\% lower because of slightly inferior
   surface passivation. However, SiCxNy-coated solar cells showed less
   degradation under lower illumination (<1000W/m2) compared with the
   SiNx-coated cells due to reduced FF degradation under low illumination.
   Theoretical calculations in this paper support that this is a direct
   result of high Rsh. Detailed photovoltaic system and cost modeling is
   performed to quantify the enhanced energy production and the reduced
   levelized cost of electricity due to higher shunt resistance of the
   SiCxNy-coated cells. It is shown that Rsh value below 30 (7000cm2 for
   239cm2 cell) can lead to appreciable loss in energy production in
   regions of low solar insolation. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Combing image processing technique and the probabilistic data

   integrating the statistical motion model, the movement of object in many
   non-electromechanical systems could be more precisely simulated than
   existing ones. (2) Because of the adoption of a global search for
   optimal model parameters, the proposed model is better to track objects
   in high noise environment, comparing with other methods that rely on
   consecutive frames differentiating. We derive the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm within the proposed model. Its
   usefulness is demonstrated with both synthesized data and image data

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death throughout
   the world and much pathology is associated with upregulation of
   inflammatory genes. Gene silencing using RNA interference is a powerful
   tool in regulating gene expression, but its application in CVDs has been
   prevented by the lack of efficient delivery systems. We report here the
   development of tadpole dendrimeric materials for siRNA delivery in a rat
   ischemia-reperfusion (IR) model. Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor
   (AT1R), the major receptor that mediates most adverse effects of Ang II,
   was chosen to be the silencing targeting. Among the three tadpole
   dendrimers synthesized, the oligo-arginine conjugated dendrimer loaded
   with siRNA demonstrated effective down-regulation in AT1R expression in
   cardiomyocytes in vitro. When the dendrimeric material was applied in
   vivo, the siRNA delivery prevented the increase in AT1R levels and
   significantly improved cardiac function recovery compared to saline
   injection or empty dendrimer treated groups after IR injury. These
   experiments demonstrate a potential treatment-for dysfunction caused by
   IR injury and may represent an alternative to AT1R blockade. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A new hybrid stochastic-deterministic transport theory method, which is
   designed to couple with diffusion theory, is presented. The new method
   is an extension of the incident flux response expansion method, and it
   combines the speed of diffusion theory with the accuracy of transport
   theory. With ease of use in mind, the new method is derived in such a
   way that it can be implemented with only minimal modifications to an
   existing diffusion theory method. A new angular expansion, which is
   necessary for the diffusion theory coupling, is developed in 2D and 3D.
   The method is implemented in 2D hexagonal geometry, and an HTTR
   benchmark problem is used to test its accuracy in a standalone
   configuration. It is found that the new method produces excellent
   results (with average relative error in partial current less than
   0.033\%) when compared with Monte Carlo reference solutions.
   Furthermore, the method is fast, solving all test cases in less than 12

Abstract = {{In this study, we constructed and expressed six fusion proteins composed
   of oligopeptides attached to the N terminus of the alkaline
   alpha-amylase (AmyK) from Alkalimonas amylolytica. The oligopeptides had
   various effects on the functional and structural characteristics of
   AmyK. AmyK-p1, the fusion protein containing peptide 1
   (AEAEAKAKAEAEAKAK), exhibited improved specific activity, catalytic
   efficiency, alkaline stability, thermal stability, and oxidative
   stability compared with AmyK. Compared with AmyK, the specific activity
   and catalytic constant (k(cat)) of AmyK-p1 were increased by 4.1-fold
   and 3.5-fold, respectively. The following properties were also improved
   in AmyK-p1 compared with AmyK: k(cat)/K-m increased from 1.8
   liter/(g.min) to 9.7 liter/(g.min), stable pH range was extended from
   7.0 to 11.0 to 7.0 to 12.0, optimal temperature increased from 50
   degrees C to 55 degrees C, and the half-life at 60 degrees C increased
   by similar to 2-fold. Moreover, AmyK-p1 showed improved resistance to
   oxidation and retained 54\% of its activity after incubation with H2O2,
   compared with 20\% activity retained by AmyK. Finally, AmyK-p1 was more
   compatible than AmyK with the commercial solid detergents tested. The
   mechanisms responsible for these changes were analyzed by comparing the
   three-dimensional (3-D) structural models of AmyK and AmyK-p1. The
   significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency and stability of AmyK-p1
   suggests its potential as a detergent ingredient. In addition, the
   oligopeptide fusion strategy described here may be useful for improving
   the catalytic efficiency and stability of other industrial enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Both male and female rat growth plate chondrocytes express estrogen
   receptors (ERs); however 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) induces membrane
   responses leading to activation of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)),
   phospholipase C (PLC), prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2))production, protein
   kinase C (PKC), and ultimately mitogen protein kinase (MAPK) only in
   female cells. This study investigated if these sex-specific responses
   are due to differences in the actual ERs or in downstream signaling.
   Western blots and flow cytometry of costochondral cartilage resting zone
   chondrocytes (RCs) showed 2-3 times more ERot in plasma membranes (PMs)
   from female cells than male cells. Tunicamycin blocked E2-dependent
   ER-translocation to the PM, indicating palmitoylation was required.
   Co-immunoprecipitation showed E-2 induced complex formation between ER
   isoforms only in female RCs. To examine if the lack of response in PKC
   and PGE(2) in males is due to differences in signaling, we examined
   involvement of ERs and the role of PLC and PLA(2). Selective ER alpha
   (propylpyrazole triol, PPT) and ER beta (diarylproprionitrile, DPN)
   agonists activated PKC in female RCs only. The PLC inhibitor, U73122
   blocked E-2's effect on PKC and the cytosolic PIA(2) inhibitor,
   AACOCF(3) inhibited the effect on PGE(2) in female RCs, confirming
   involvement of PLC and PLA(2) in the mechanism. The PLC activator,
   m-3M3F beta S activated PKC and PLAA peptide increased PGE(2) levels in
   male and female RCs, showing that the signaling pathways are present.
   These data indicate that differences in membrane ER amount,
   localization, translocafion and interaction are responsible for the
   sexual dimorphic response to E-2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the results of an experiment involving a wearable
   sensorimotor enhancer intended to improve tactile sensitivity in human
   fingertips. As briefly exposing tactile receptors to subsensory
   vibration is known to enhance tactile sensitivity thanks to a phenomenon
   called stochastic resonance in the somatosensory system, applying
   white-noise vibration to a fingertip is expected to improve the sense of
   touch and associated motor skills. Against such a background, a
   prototype of a wearable device called a sensorimotor enhancer is
   proposed here. The device is attached to the radial side of the
   fingertip and stimulates tactile receptors by applying vibration from a
   lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric stack actuator. This design keeps
   the palmar region free, thereby helping to maintain the wearer's
   manipulative ability. Sensory and motor tests involving 11 human
   subjects were conducted to determine the efficacy of the device, and the
   results confirmed its usefulness.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of shear wave velocities toward the evaluation of the in
   situ geostatic horizontal stress state in soils is validated,
   specifically the lateral stress coefficient K-0. Field shear wave
   velocities from paired sets of different directional and polarization
   modes are compiled from 16 well-documented test sites involving a
   variety of geomaterials. Focus is particularly placed on shear wave
   velocities measured by downhole tests (V-sVH), crosshole tests (V-sHV),
   and special rotary-type crosshole tests (V-sHH). At these sites, field
   K-0 stress states have been quantified using one or more direct
   assessment techniques, including self-boring pressuremeter, total stress
   cells, and hydrofracture in field testing, as well as suction
   measurements, special consolidometers, and/or triaxial arrangements on
   undisturbed samples in the laboratory. Although the specific delineation
   of stress-induced versus inherent or fabric anisotropy may be difficult,
   it is shown that the ratio of horizontally polarized to vertically
   polarized shear waves (i.e., either V-sHH/V-sVH or V-sHH/V-sHV) can be
   used to provide an approximate assessment of K-0 in soils, especially if
   coupled with the age of the formation. DOI:

   pNIPAAm are investigated for their efficacy on highly branched polymers.
   Of these techniques, cosolvent-mediated tacticity control demonstrates
   an effect opposite of that which is expected. Temperature transition
   control via end-group modification shows a marked decrease in efficacy
   in highly branched systems, despite highly branched systems having more
   end groups per polymer. Copolymerization with hydrophilic comonomers
   exhibits varying changes in efficacy compared to linear analogs, lending
   insights into the specific effects on the structured water surrounding
   the copolymer. While copolymerization proved to be most versatile in
   changing the transition temperature, all of the techniques showed
   interesting secondary effects. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym

Abstract = {{The widespread availability of nano-enabled products in the global
   market may lead to the release of a substantial amount of engineered
   nanoparticles in the environment, which frequently display drastically
   different physiochemical properties than their bulk counterparts. The
   purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of citrate-stabilised
   silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the plant Arabidopsis thaliana at three
   levels, physiological phytotoxicity, cellular accumulation and
   subcellular transport of AgNPs. The monodisperse AgNPs of three
   different sizes (20, 40 and 80 nm) aggregated into much larger sizes
   after mixing with quarter-strength Hoagland solution and became
   polydisperse. Immersion in AgNP suspension inhibited seedling root
   elongation and demonstrated a linear dose-response relationship within
   the tested concentration range. The phytotoxic effect of AgNPs could not
   be fully explained by the released silver ions. Plants exposed to AgNP
   suspensions bioaccumulated higher silver content than plants exposed to
   AgNO3 solutions (Ag+ representative), indicating AgNP uptake by plants.
   AgNP toxicity was size and concentration dependent. AgNPs accumulated
   progressively in this sequence: border cells, root cap, columella and
   columella initials. AgNPs were apoplastically transported in the cell
   wall and found aggregated at plasmodesmata. In all the three levels
   studied, AgNP impacts differed from equivalent dosages of AgNO3.}},

Abstract = {{We report the influence of an InN layer inserted between InGaN and GaN
   on the optical properties of InGaN/GaN light emitting diode (LED). The
   emission wavelength of the InGaN/GaN LED with the InN layer was 459 nm
   at 10 K, which was red-shifted by 6 nm from that of the LED without the
   insertion layer (reference LED). The peak position of the reference LED
   subjected to thermal treatment at 825 degrees C was blue-shifted by 3.5
   nm compared to that of the as-grown sample due to the structural
   variation of indium (In)-related features in InGaN/GaN quantum wells
   (QWs) and inter-diffusion of In and gallium (Ga) at the interface.
   However, the emission peak for the InGaN/GaN LED with the InN layer was
   red-shifted with increasing annealing temperatures. This result can be
   explained by the additional introduction of In to InGaN/GaN QWs and the
   reduction in the probability for Ga atoms at the GaN barrier to diffuse
   into InGaN through the InN layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The study of genomes has been revolutionized by sequencing machines that
   output many short overlapping substrings (called reads). The task of
   sequence assembly in practice is to reconstruct long contiguous genome
   subsequences from the reads. With Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
   technologies, assembly software needs to be more accurate, faster, and
   more memory-efficient due to the problem complexity and the size of the
   data sets. In this paper, we develop parallel algorithms and compressed
   data structures to address several computational challenges of NGS
   assembly. We demonstrate how commonly available multicore architectures
   can be efficiently utilized for sequence assembly. In all stages
   (indexing input strings, string graph construction and simplification,
   extraction of contiguous subsequences) of our software PASQUAL, we use
   shared-memory parallelism to speed up the assembly process. In our
   experiments with data of up to 6.8 billion base pairs, we demonstrate
   that PASQUAL generally delivers the best tradeoff between speed, memory
   consumption, and solution quality. On synthetic and real data sets
   PASQUAL scales well on our test machine with 40 CPU cores with
   increasing number of threads. Given enough cores, PASQUAL is fastest in
   our comparison.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{68-94}},

Abstract = {{A complete micromechanics-based model is here proposed using the
   concepts of continuum kinematics and thermodynamics. A new constitutive
   framework is proposed to describe stress-induced ``shear-coupled{''}
   grain boundary (GB) migration. Like non diffusive phase-transformations,
   shear-coupled GB migration can be considered on the thermodynamics point
   of view of conservative nature until high temperature with respect to
   melting point (i.e., diffusionless but thermally activated). The
   micromechanics-based continuum model can include intra-crystalline slip,
   GB sliding and shear-coupled GB migration as additive dissipative
   mechanisms. To illustrate the present theory, the model is applied to
   shear-coupled GB migration in the case of three ``flat{''} Cu
   bi-crystals {[}001] with symmetric tilt GB (STGB): Sigma 17(410) (theta
   = 28.07 degrees), Sigma 5(210) (theta = 53.13 degrees), Sigma 41(540)
   (theta = 77.32 degrees). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under
   simple shear loading are first performed to identify the active shear
   coupling modes, the stick-slip behavior at 0 K and 500 K and the
   bicrystal finite size dependence on the shear stress responses. The
   results of the micromechanical model are discussed in comparison with MD
   simulations. The effects of anisotropic vs. isotropic elastic properties
   on effective elastic shear Moduli, overall shear stress drop magnitudes
   and dissipated energy during GB migration are analyzed for these STGB.

Abstract = {{Non-Schmid phenomena leading to yield asymmetry are known to occur in
   BCC metals and intermetallic compounds due to complex mechanisms such as
   those related to the threedimensional core of screw dislocations, and
   their resulting cross slip activities sensitive to non-Schmid stresses.
   In this study, we identify and discuss a flow asymmetry due to a
   possible dependence of \{10 (1) over bar2\} twinning and non-basal slip
   critical resolved shear stresses. Both crystal plasticity simulations
   and EBSD serial imaging analyses, where an identical region is analyzed
   at various strain levels, suggested that these non-Schmid effects
   correlate with the effect of mantle plasticity, which is sensitive to
   the stress sign and initial texture. It was deduced from EBSD serial
   imaging analyses that low misoriented grain boundaries underwent a
   substantially higher nucleation and growth rates of twinning than highly
   misoriented grain boundaries. Conventional crystal plasticity based on a
   pseudo-slip approach for twinning was unable to capture these
   mantle-induced grain boundary effects related to the magnesium
   tension-compression asymmetry. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research and applications in construction resource optimization
   have focused on tracking the location of material and equipment. There
   is a lack of studies on remote monitoring for improving safety and
   health of the construction workforce. This paper presents a new approach
   for monitoring ergonomically safe and unsafe behavior of construction
   workers. The study relies on a methodology that utilizes fusion of data
   from continuous remote monitoring of construction workers' location and
   physiological status. To monitor construction workers activities, the
   authors deployed nonintrusive real-time worker location sensing (RTLS)
   and physiological status monitoring (PSM) technology. This paper
   presents the background and need for a data fusion approach, the
   framework, the test bed environment, and results to some case studies
   that were used to automatically identify unhealthy work behavior.
   Results of this study suggest a new approach for automating remote
   monitoring of construction workers safety performance by fusing data on
   their location and physical strain. DOI:

Abstract = {{Automated crack-sealing machinery must accurately locate continuous
   individual crack segments so that they can be processed and treated
   effectively. In this paper, we illustrate the use of a geodesic minimal
   path based method for generating the crack map suitable for the path
   planning process. The user can detect continuous cracks that extend over
   several miles just by providing the starting point of a crack as an
   input to the algorithm. The algorithm can also detect transverse cracks
   by giving a single point on the crack. The continuous crack map
   generated can be utilized very efficiently to generate the optimal path
   for the crack sealer. An extensive qualitative and quantitative
   evaluation on real pavement images was done to show the usefulness of
   the algorithm. The algorithm is computationally fast and efficient. (C)

Abstract = {{In recent years, with the increasing level of competition in the global
   construction market several research efforts have focused on the
   application of information technology (IT) as a way to improve the
   integration process of construction supply chain management (CSCM).
   Visual representation of the process can provide an effective tool for
   monitoring resources in the CSCM. In order to support this objective,
   this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic
   information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping
   track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure
   the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is
   implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a
   detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process.
   Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used
   in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the
   CSCM, GIS is used in the present model. Thus, this paper represents the
   integrated GIS-BIM model manifesting the flow of materials, availability
   of resources, and ``map{''} of the respective supply chains visually. A
   case example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the
   developed system. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a fuzzy model predictive control (FMPC) approach is
   introduced to design a control system for nonlinear processes. The
   proposed control strategy has been successfully employed for
   representative, benchmark chemical processes. Each nonlinear process
   system is described by fuzzy convolution models, which comprise a number
   of quasi-linear fuzzy implications (FIs). Each FI is employed to
   describe a fuzzy-set based relation between control input and model
   output. A quadratic optimization problem is then formulated, which
   minimizes the difference between the model predictions and the desired
   trajectory over a predefined predictive horizon and the requirement of
   control energy over a shorter control horizon. The present work proposes
   to solve this optimization problem by employing a contemporary
   population-based evolutionary optimization strategy, called the
   Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm. The solution of this
   optimization problem is utilized to determine optimal controller
   parameters. The utility of the proposed controller is demonstrated by
   applying it to two non-linear chemical processes, where this controller
   could achieve better performances than those achieved by similar
   competing controller, under various operating conditions and design
   considerations. Further comparisons between various stochastic
   optimization algorithms have been reported and the efficacy of the
   proposed approach over similar optimization based algorithms has been
   concluded employing suitable performance indices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Experimental studies with single-crystal surfaces and computational
   simulations have long established that the activity and selectivity of a
   heterogeneous catalyst for a structure-sensitive reaction can be
   maximized by controlling the arrangement of atoms on the surface. The
   essence of these studies, however, could not be materialized until very
   recently when it became possible to generate faceted nanocrystals with
   controlled shapes and sizes, including those with high-index facets. In
   principle, the size of a faceted nanocrystal determines the
   surface-to-bulk atomic ratio and the proportions of different types
   (e.g. vertex, edge, and face) of atoms while the shape governs the types
   of facets on its surface and thus the arrangement of face atoms.
   Additionally, the adsorption of atomic/molecular species during the
   synthesis of nanocrystals and operation of a catalytic reaction can
   alter their shape and thus their durability as a catalyst. All of these
   issues need to be fully understood and addressed in the design,
   synthesis, and utilization of faceted noble-metal nanocrystals for

Abstract = {{Barium zirconate-based high-temperature proton conductors (HTPCs)
   exhibit excellent chemical stability in atmospheres containing CO2 or
   water vapor. However, such HPTCs haven't been widely used as electrolyte
   materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) due to their poor sintering
   activity. In this work, indium is selected as a dopant to improve the
   sintering activity of barium zirconate. BaZr0.8In0.2O3-delta (BZI)
   powders with a pure cubic perovskite structure are synthesized via a
   typical citric acid-nitrate gel combustion process. The SEM results show
   that BZI exhibits improved sintering activity compared to the
   state-of-the-art proton conductor BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY), and fully
   dense BZI pellets with increased grain size are obtained after sintered
   at 1600 degrees C in air. Moreover, BZI also keeps sufficiently high
   chemical stability as BZY. The electrical conductivity of BZI under
   various atmospheres is investigated by electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) in detail. The total conductivity achieves 1.0 x
   10(-3) S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C in wet H-2 (3\% H2O). Dense BZI
   electrolyte films are successfully fabricated on the anode substrates by
   a dry-pressing method after sintered at 1400 degrees C for 5 h in air.
   Single cells with dense BZI electrolyte films are also assembled and
   tested to further evaluate the feasibility of BZI as an electrolyte
   material for proton-conducting SOFCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Low apparent density Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) powders of different
   morphology and microstructure are derived from a glycine-nitrate process
   using Ce(NO3)(3) and Ce(NH4)(2)(NO3)(6) as the cerium sources. When the
   molar ratio of the two cerium precursors is around 1:1, the derived SDC
   powders can be readily sintered to high density, exhibiting the highest
   conductivities (similar to 0.084 and similar to 0.020 S cm(-1) at 800
   and 600 degrees C, respectively) with an activation energy of similar to
   0.70 eV. When the molar ratio of Ce(NO3)(3) to Ce(NH4)(2)(NO3)(6) was
   adjusted to 3:1, the derived SDC powders have the lowest apparent
   density (36.0 +/- 0.5 mg cm(-3)), best suited for preparation of dense,
   thin-film SDC electrolyte membranes on porous anode substrates, a
   critical step toward low-cost fabrication of high-performance SOFCs. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop dissipativity notions for dynamical systems
   with discontinuous vector fields. Specifically, we consider dynamical
   systems with Lebesgue measurable and locally essentially bounded vector
   fields characterized by differential inclusions involving Filippov
   set-valued maps specifying a set of directions for the system velocity
   and admitting Filippov solutions with absolutely continuous curves. In
   particular, we introduce a generalized definition of dissipativity for
   discontinuous dynamical systems in terms of set-valued supply rate maps
   and set-valued storage maps consisting of locally Lebesgue integrable
   supply rates and Lipschitz continuous storage functions, respectively.
   In addition, we introduce the notion of a set-valued available storage
   map and a set-valued required supply map, and show that if these maps
   have closed convex images they specialize to single-valued maps
   corresponding to the smallest available storage and the largest required
   supply of the differential inclusion, respectively. Furthermore, we show
   that all system storage functions are bounded from above by the largest
   required supply and bounded from below by the smallest available
   storage, and hence, a dissipative differential inclusion can deliver to
   its surroundings only a fraction of its generalized stored energy and
   can store only a fraction of the generalized work done to it. Moreover,
   extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions, in terms of the
   discontinuous system dynamics, characterizing dissipativity via
   generalized Clarke gradients and locally Lipschitz continuous storage
   functions are derived. Finally, these results are then used to develop
   feedback interconnection stability results for discontinuous systems
   thereby providing a generalization of the small gain and positivity
   theorems to systems with discontinuous vector fields. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {{205}},

Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Operando spectroscopy is a methodology that combines the spectroscopic
   characterization of a catalytic material during reaction with the
   simultaneous measurement of the actual performance of the catalyst, e.
   g. conversion and selectivity. The simultaneous quantitative assessment
   of the catalytic performance differentiates operando spectroscopy from
   in situ spectroscopy. Unfortunately, confusion regarding this difference
   has led to the use of the grammatically incorrect term ``in operando{''}
   in recent literature. In situ means ``in place{''}, whereas
   ``operando{''} means ``working{''} or ``operating{''}, i.e. the catalyst
   at work, so it is incorrect to state ``in working{''}, which is what in
   operando would imply. Operando spectroscopy was formally introduced into
   the catalysis community around 2002, with the idea that a new term was
   required to emphasize the importance of simultaneously combining
   fundamental spectroscopic measurements with quantification of catalytic
   performance, on the same sample, under realistic reaction conditions. It
   is important to point out that operando studies are focused on intrinsic
   kinetics rather than reactions that are limited by transport limitations
   etc. The potential impact of operando spectroscopy on catalysis science
   lies in its ability to significantly assist in the establishment of
   fundamental molecular structure-activity/selectivity relationships for
   catalytic systems. It is critical that the design of the spectroscopic
   reaction cell, the catalytic reactor, also allows for the generation of
   catalytic performance data that is analogous to those achieved with
   conventional catalytic reactors. Every three years, beginning with a
   conference held in Lunteren, The Netherlands in 2003 there has been an
   International Congress on Operando Spectroscopy (Toledo, Spain in 2006;
   Rostock, Germany in 2009; and Brookhaven, USA in 2012). This conference
   series has become the premier venue for researchers from around the
   world to present their latest work, debate, and discuss the present and
   future of operando catalyst characterization. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{ATR-IR spectroscopy is used to show that Pt/gamma-Al2O3 readily
   activates glycerol in an aqueous environment at room temperature forming
   surface bound carbon monoxide. CO is present on the surface of the Pt
   particles as linear (COL) and bridging species (COB). Some of the CO
   species are even susceptible to water-gas shift at room temperature. The
   rates of formation and conversion of different CO species strongly
   depend on the catalyst layer cleaning procedure used prior to the
   kinetic studies. Exposing the catalyst to hydrogen saturated water
   induces the formation of adsorbed hydrogen and two linearly bound CO
   species from impurities on the Pt particles. One of these species is CO
   primarily interacting with coadsorbed hydrogen, the other is primarily
   interacting with molecularly adsorbed H2O. All of these species inhibit
   further CO formation from glycerol. The preferred binding site for
   adsorbed hydrogen appears to be Pt sites that preferentially form COB.
   Dissolved oxygen is effective at removing all of these species and
   produces a CO free Pt surface for subsequent CO formation from glycerol.
   When oxygen saturated water is used for pretreating the catalyst layer,
   residual oxygen adsorbed on the Pt initially converts CO formed from
   glycerol to CO2 and results in slightly reduced apparent rates of CO
   formation. Pretreatment with alternating flows of hydrogen and oxygen
   saturated water is the most effective cleaning procedure for
   Pt/gamma-Al2O3. The fastest rates of CO formation are observed after
   this pretreatment due to the highest concentration of available Pt sites
   and the availability of some particularly reactive Pt sites. These
   exceptionally reactive sites preferentially form adsorbed hydrogen and
   COB species from glycerol and are also active for removal of COB species
   via water-gas shift. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Defining feasible bounds on muscle activation in a redundant

Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Measured muscle activation patterns often vary significantly from
   musculoskeletal model predictions that use optimization to resolve
   redundancy. Although experimental muscle activity exhibits both inter-
   and intra-subject variability we lack adequate tools to quantify the
   biomechanical latitude that the nervous system has when selecting muscle
   activation patterns. Here, we identified feasible ranges of individual
   muscle activity during force production in a musculoskeletal model to
   quantify the degree to which biomechanical redundancy allows for
   variability in muscle activation patterns. In a detailed cat hindlimb
   model matched to the posture of three cats, we identified the lower and
   upper bounds on muscle activity in each of 31 muscles during static
   endpoint force production across different force directions and
   magnitudes. Feasible ranges of muscle activation were relatively
   unconstrained across force magnitudes such that only a few (0-13\%)
   muscles were found to be truly ``necessary{''} (e.g. exhibited non-zero
   lower bounds) at physiological force ranges. Most of the muscles were
   ``optional{''}, having zero lower bounds, and frequently had
   ``maximal{''} upper bounds as well. Moreover, ``optional{''} muscles
   were never selected by optimization methods that either minimized muscle
   stress, or that scaled the pattern required for maximum force
   generation. Therefore, biomechanical constraints were generally
   insufficient to restrict or specify muscle activation levels for
   producing a force in a given direction, and many muscle patterns exist
   that could deviate substantially from one another but still achieve the
   task. Our approach could be extended to identify the feasible limits of
   variability in muscle activation patterns in dynamic tasks such as
   walking. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Gene expression patterns following unilateral traumatic brain injury
   reveals a local pro-inflammatory and remote anti-inflammatory response}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in irreversible damage
   at the site of impact and initiates cellular and molecular processes
   that lead to secondary neural injury in the surrounding tissue. We used
   microarray analysis to determine which genes, pathways and networks were
   significantly altered using a rat model of TBI. Adult rats received a
   unilateral controlled cortical impact (CCI) and were sacrificed 24 h
   post-injury. The ipsilateral hemi-brain tissue at the site of the
   injury, the corresponding contralateral hemi-brain tissue, and naive
   (control) brain tissue were used for microarray analysis. Ingenuity
   Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to identify molecular pathways
   and networks that were associated with the altered gene expression in
   brain tissues following TBI.
   Results: Inspection of the top fifteen biological functions in IPA
   associated with TBI in the ipsilateral tissues revealed that all had an
   inflammatory component. IPA analysis also indicated that inflammatory
   genes were altered on the contralateral side, but many of the genes were
   inversely expressed compared to the ipsilateral side. The contralateral
   gene expression pattern suggests a remote anti-inflammatory molecular
   response. We created a network of the inversely expressed common (i.e.,
   same gene changed on both sides of the brain) inflammatory response (IR)
   genes and those IR genes included in pathways and networks identified by
   IPA that changed on only one side. We ranked the genes by the number of
   direct connections each had in the network, creating a gene interaction
   hierarchy (GIH). Two well characterized signaling pathways, toll-like
   receptor/NF-kappaB signaling and JAK/STAT signaling, were prominent in
   our GIH.
   Conclusions: Bioinformatic analysis of microarray data following TBI
   identified key molecular pathways and networks associated with neural
   injury following TBI. The GIH created here provides a starting point for
   investigating therapeutic targets in a ranked order that is somewhat
   different than what has been presented previously. In addition to being
   a vehicle for identifying potential targets for post-TBI therapeutic
   strategies, our findings can also provide a context for evaluating the
   potential of therapeutic agents currently in development.}},

Abstract = {{The incorporation of accessible amine functionality in zeolitic
   imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) is used to improve the adsorption
   selectivity for CO2/CH4 gas separation applications. Two synthetic
   approaches are described in this work to introduce functionality into
   the ZIF: (i) mixed-linker ZIF synthesis with 2-aminobenzimidazole as a
   substitution linker and (ii) postsynthetic modification of a
   mixed-linker ZIF with ethylenecliamine. Using 2-aminobenzimidazole, a
   linker with a primary amine functional group, substitution of the ZIF-8
   linker during synthesis allows for control over the adsorption
   properties while maintaining the ZIF-8 structure with up to nearly 50\%
   substitution in the mixed-linker ZIF framework, producing a material
   with tunable pore size and amine functionality. Alternatively,
   postsynthetic modification of a mixed linker ZIF containing an aldehyde
   functional group produces a ZIF material with a primary amine without
   detrimental loss of micropore Volume by controlling the amount of
   functional group sites for modification: Both approaches using mixed
   linker ZIFs yield new materials that show improvement in adsorption
   selectivity for the CO2/CH4 gas pair over ZIF-8 and commercially
   available adsorbents as well as an increase in the heat of adsorption
   for CO2 without significant changes to the crystal structure. These
   results indicate that tuning the surface properties of ZIFs by either
   mixed linker Synthesis and/or postsynthetic modification may generate
   new materials with improved gas separation properties, thereby providing
   a new method for tailoring metal-organic frameworks.}},

   lt-{[}(2,5-bis(2-ethyl-hexyl)-1,4-phenylene)bis(ethyn-2,1-diyl]\}
   (PDIC8-EB), is synthesized. In chloroform, the polymer undergoes
   self-assembly, forming a nanowire suspension. The nanowire's optical and
   electrochemical properties, morphological structure, and field-effect
   transistor (FET) characteristics are investigated. Thin films fabricated
   from a PDIC8-EB nanowire suspension are composed of ordered nanowires
   and ordered and amorphous non-nanowire phases, whereas films prepared
   from a homogeneous PDIC8-EB solution consist of only the ordered and
   amorphous non-nanowire phases. X-ray scattering experiments suggest that
   in both nanowires and ordered phases, the PDIC8 units are laterally
   stacked in an edge-on manner with respect to the film plane, with full
   interdigitation of the octyl chains, and with the polymer backbones
   preferentially oriented within the film plane. The ordering and
   orientations are significantly enhanced through thermal annealing at 200
   degrees C under inert conditions. The polymer film with high degree of
   structural ordering and strong orientation yields a high electron
   mobility (0.10 +/- 0.05 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), with a high on/off ratio (3.7
   x 10(6)), a low threshold voltage (8 V), and negligible hysteresis (0.5
   V). This study demonstrates that the polymer in the nanowire suspension
   provides a suitable material for fabricating the active layers of
   high-performance n-channel FET devices via a solution coating process.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the shape or morphology of metal nanocrystals is central to
   the realization of their many applications in catalysis, plasmonics, and
   electronics. In one of the approaches, the metal nanocrystals are grown
   from seeds of certain crystallinity through the addition of atomic
   species. In this case, manipulating the rates at which the atomic
   species are added onto different crystallographic planes of a seed has
   been actively explored to control the growth pattern of a seed and
   thereby the shape or morphology taken by the final product. Upon
   deposition, however, the adsorbed atoms (adatoms) may not stay at the
   same sites where the depositions occur. Instead, they can migrate to
   other sites on the seed owing to the involvement of surface diffusion,
   and this could lead to unexpected deviations from a desired growth
   pathway. Herein, we demonstrated that the growth pathway of a seed is
   indeed determined by the ratio between the rates for atom deposition and
   surface diffusion. Our result suggests that surface diffusion needs to
   be taken into account when controlling the shape or morphology of metal
   nanocrystals.}},

Title = {{Effects of Microparticle Size and Fc Density on Macrophage Phagocytosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Controlled induction of phagocytosis in macrophages offers the ability
   to therapeutically regulate the immune system as well as improve
   delivery of chemicals or biologicals for immune processing. Maximizing
   particle uptake by macrophages through Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis
   could lead to new delivery mechanisms in drug or vaccine development. Fc
   ligand density and particle size were examined independently and in
   combination in order to optimize and tune the phagocytosis of opsonized
   microparticles. We show the internalization efficiency of small
   polystyrene particles (0.5 mu m to 2 mm) is significantly affected by
   changes in Fc ligand density, while particles greater than 2 mu m show
   little correlation between internalization and Fc density. We found that
   while macrophages can efficiently phagocytose a large number of smaller
   particles, the total volume of phagocytosed particles is maximized
   through the non-specific uptake of larger microparticles. Therefore,
   larger microparticles may be more efficient at delivering a greater
   therapeutic payload to macrophages, but smaller opsonized microparticles
   can deliver bio-active substances to a greater percentage of the
   macrophage population. This study is the first to treat as independent
   variables the physical and biological properties of Fc density and
   microparticle size that initiate macrophage phagocytosis. Defining the
   physical and biological parameters that affect phagocytosis efficiency
   will lead to improved methods of microparticle delivery to macrophages.}},

   multiband and multi-gigabit 60-GHz millimeter wave (MMW) signals using

   low-frequency (<= 12GHz) optical and electrical devices are used in the
   central station (CS), which enable a cost-effective system. At the
   user-terminal, two-stage down-conversions are employed by envelope
   detection (ED) and intermediate frequency (IF) mixing, eliminating
   expensive highspeed synthesizer and critical phase control components.
   Error-free performances are achieved for the multiband MMW signals after

Abstract = {{Metallic melts containing Bi show a certain degree of anomalies in their
   physical and chemical properties. In order to facilitate computational
   design of novel Bi-alloys for industrial applications, the phase

   experimental characterizations. The associate solution model is
   introduced to describe the thermodynamic properties of Bi-Li and Bi-Na
   melts, and two binary associates, e.g. BiLi3 and BiNa3, are taken into
   consideration. The intermetallic phases involved in such two binary
   systems are treated as stochiometric phases. Rhombohedral Bi, bcc Li and
   bcc Na are considered as phases without any solubility. The Gibbs
   energies of all the involved phases are formulated in this work, which
   can give satisfactory thermodynamic descriptions for related phase
   equilibria and phase diagrams. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The deformation of the meizoseismal area of the 2008 Achaia-Elia (M-W
   6.4) earthquake in NW Peloponnese, of the first significant strike slip
   earthquake in continental Greece, was examined in two time scales; of
   102 years, based on the analysis of high-accuracy historical
   triangulation data describing shear, and of 10(5)-10(6) years, based on
   the analysis of the hydrographic network of the area for signs of
   streams offset by faulting. Our study revealed pre-seismic accumulation
   of shear strain of the order of 0.2 mu rad/year in the study area,
   consistent with recent GPS evidence, but no signs of significant strike
   slip-induced offsets in the hydrographic network. These results confirm
   the hypothesis that the 2008 fault, which did not reached the surface
   and was not associated with significant seismic ground deformation,
   probably because of a surface flysch layer filtering high-strain events,
   was associated with an immature or a dormant, recently activated fault.
   This fault, about 150 km long and discordant to the morphotectonic
   trends of the area, seems first, to contain segments which have
   progressively reactivated in a specific direction in the last 20 years,
   reminiscent of the North Anatolian Fault, and second, to limit an 150 km
   wide (recent?) shear zone in the internal part of the arc, in a region
   mostly dominated by thrust faulting and strong destructive earthquakes.

Title = {{Oxidative stress-induced Notch1 signaling promotes cardiogenic gene
   expression in mesenchymal stem cells}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs) after myocardial infarction (MI) results in modest
   functional improvements. However; the effect of microenvironment changes
   after MI, such as elevated levels of oxidative stress on cardiogenic
   gene expression of MSCs, remains unclear.
   Methods: MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of adult rats and
   treated for 1 week with H2O2 (0.1 to 100 mu M) or 48 hours with glucose
   oxidase (GOX; 0 to 5 mU/ml) to mimic long-term pulsed or short-term
   continuous levels of H2O2, respectively.
   Results: In 100 mu M H2O2 or 5 mU/ml GOX-treated MSCs, mRNA expression
   of selected endothelial genes (Flt1, vWF, PECAM1), and early cardiac
   marker (nkx2-5, aMHC) increased significantly, whereas early smooth
   muscle markers (smooth muscle a-actin and sm22 alpha) and fibroblast
   marker vimentin decreased, as measured with real-time PCR.
   Interestingly, mRNA expression and activity of the cell-surface receptor
   Notch1 were significantly increased, as were its downstream targets,
   Hes5 and Hey1. Co-treatment of MSCs with 100 mu M H2O2 and a.-secretase
   inhibitor that prevents Notch signaling abrogated the increase in
   cardiac and endothelial genes, while augmenting the decrease in smooth
   muscle markers. Further, on GOX treatment, a significant increase in
   Wnt11, a downstream target of Notch1, was observed. Similar results were
   obtained with adult rat cardiac-derived progenitor cells.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that H2O2-or GOX-mediated oxidative
   stress upregulates Notch1 signaling, which promotes cardiogenic gene
   expression in adult stem/progenitor cells, possibly involving Wnt11.
   Modulating the balance between Notch activation and H2O2-mediated
   oxidative stress may lead to improved adult stem cell-based therapies
   for cardiac repair and regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{We develop transferable force fields describing water adsorption in
   copper-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by combining dispersion
   corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and classical
   atomistic simulations. The DFT-D2 approach was found to give reasonable
   agreement with high level quantum chemistry results for the interaction
   between water and CuBTC. A classical force field for water adsorption in
   CuBTC including Lennard-Jones (LJ), Coulombic interactions, and a
   water-copper distance-dependent correction term was then developed on
   the basis of 1200 DFT-D2 calculations that probed the full range of
   accessible volume in CuBTC via random sampling. Good agreement was
   obtained between adsorption isotherms predicted with our
   first-principles-derived force field and experiments. Other commonly
   used models such as simple combinations of U and Coulomb potentials
   cannot adequately describe the interaction between water and CuBTC due
   to the chemical bonding between water oxygen and copper atoms. The
   transferability of this force field was examined using available
   adsorption isotherms for water in two structurally distinct copper-based
   MOFs, CuMBTC (methyl-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) and CuEBTC
   (ethyl-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), again with reasonably good

   isochoric-isoenergetic ensembles using an embedded atom method. Emphasis
   is placed on analyzing the melting points of the core and shell,
   diffusion of atoms, and intermetallic reactions. The aluminum core melts
   at a temperature greater than the melting point of a nascent aluminum
   particle due to the cage like mechanical constraint imposed by the
   nickel shell. The melting point of the aluminum core increases from 775
   to 1000 K when the core diameter increases from 3 to 12 mm The melting
   point of the core is not significantly affected by variations in the
   shell thickness in the range of 1-3 nm, although the melting point of
   the shell increases with increasing thickness from a value as low as
   1100 K at 1 nut to 1580 K at 3 nm. Melting is followed by diffusion of
   atoms and energy release due to intermetallic reactions, which result in
   ignition of the partide in vacuum. For a core diameter of 3 run, the
   ignition temperature increases from 800 to 1600 K when the shell
   thickness increases from 0.5 to 3.0 nm. The diffusion coefficient of
   aluminum atoms in the nickel shell exhibits an exponential dependence on
   temperature, with activation energy of 34.7 kJ/mol. The adiabatic
   reaction temperature of the particle increases from 1650 to 2338 K when
   the core diameter increases from 3 to 8 nm. The calculated values agree
   reasonably well with those obtained via thermodynamic energy balance
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated theoretical and numerical framework is developed to study
   the dynamics of energy coupling, gas heating and generation of active
   species by repetitively pulsed nanosecond dielectric barrier discharges
   (NS DBDs) in air. The work represents one of the first attempts to
   simulate, in a self-consistent manner, multiple (more than 100)
   nanosecond pulses. Detailed information is obtained about the
   electric-field transients during each voltage pulse, and accumulation of
   plasma generated species and gas heating over ms timescales. The plasma
   is modelled using a two-temperature, detailed chemistry scheme, with
   ions and neutral species in thermal equilibrium at the gas temperature,
   and electrons in thermal nonequilibrium. The analysis is conducted with
   pressures and pulsing frequency in the range 40-100 Torr and 1-10(5) Hz,
   respectively. The input electrical energy is directly proportional to
   the number density, and remains fairly constant on a per molecule basis
   from pulse to pulse. Repetitive pulsing results in uniform production of
   atomic oxygen in the discharge volume via electron-impact dissociation
   during voltage pulses, and through quenching of excited nitrogen
   molecules in the afterglow. The ion Joule effect causes rapid gas
   heating of similar to 40 K/pulse in the cathode sheath and generates
   weak acoustic waves. Conductive heat loss to the walls during the time
   interval between voltage pulses prevents overheating of the cathode
   layer and development of ionization instabilities. A uniform
   `hat-shaped' temperature profile develops in the discharge volume after
   multiple pulses, due to chemical heat release from quenching of excited
   species. This finding may explain experimentally observed volumetric
   ignition (as opposed to hot-spot ignition) in fuel-air mixtures subject
   to NS DBD.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft-based measurements of aerosol composition, either bulk or
   single-particle, and both subsaturated and supersaturated hygroscopicity
   were made in the Los Angeles Basin and its outflows during May 2010
   during the CalNex field study. Aerosol composition evolves from
   source-rich areas in the western Basin to downwind sites in the eastern
   Basin, evidenced by transition from an external to internal mixture, as
   well as enhancements in organic O:C ratio, the amount of organics and
   nitrate internally mixed on almost all particle types, and coating
   thickness on refractory black carbon (rBC). Transport into hot, dilute
   outflow regions leads to significant volatilization of semivolatile
   material, resulting in a unimodal aerosol comprising primarily
   oxygenated, low-volatility, water-soluble organics and sulfate. The
   fraction of particles with rBC or soot cores is between 27 and 51\%
   based on data from a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and Aerosol
   Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS). Secondary organics appear to
   inhibit subsaturated water uptake in aged particles, while CCN activity
   is enhanced with photochemical age. A biomass-burning event resulted in
   suppression of subsaturated hygroscopicity but enhancement in CCN
   activity, suggesting that BB particles may be nonhygroscopic at
   subsaturated RH but are important sources of CCN. Aerosol aging and
   biomass burning can lead to discrepancies between subsaturated and
   supersaturated hygroscopicity that may be related to mixing state. In
   the cases of biomass burning aerosol and aged particles coated with
   secondary material, more than a single parameter representation of
   subsaturated hygroscopicity and CCN activity is needed.}},

Title = {{Energy Component Analysis of pi Interactions}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{1020-1028}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental features of biomolecules, such as their structure, I
   solvation, and crystal packing and even the docking of drugs, rely on
   noncovalent interactions. Theory can help elucidate the nature of these
   interactions, and energy component analysis reveals the contributions
   from the various intermolecular forces: electrostatics, London
   dispersion terms, induction (polarization), and short-range exchange
   repulsion. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides one
   method for this type of analysis.
   In this Account, we show several examples of how SAPT provides insight
   into the nature of noncovalent pi-interactions. In cation-pi
   interactions, the cation strongly polarizes electrons in pi-orbitals,
   leading to substantially attractive induction terms. This polarization
   is so important that a cation and a benzene attract each other when
   placed in the same plane, even though a consideration of the
   electrostatic interactions alone would suggest otherwise. SAPT analysis
   can also support an understanding of substituent effects in pi-pi
   interactions. Trends in face-to-face sandwich benzene dimers cannot be
   understood solely in terms of electrostatic effects, especially for
   multiply substituted dimers, but SAPT analysis demonstrates the
   importance of London dispersion forces. Moreover, detailed SAPT studies
   also reveal the critical importance of charge penetration effects in
   pi-stacking interactions. These effects arise in cases with substantial
   orbital overlap, such as in pi-stacking in DNA or in crystal structures
   of pi-conjugated materials. These charge penetration effects lead to
   attractive electrostatic terms where a simpler analysis based on
   atom-centered charges, electrostatic potential plots, or even
   distributed multipole analysis would incorrectly predict repulsive
   electrostatics. SAPT analysis of sandwich benzene, benzene pyridine, and
   pyridine dimers indicates that dipole/induced-dipole terms present in
   benzene pyridine but not in benzene dimer are relatively unimportant. In
   general, a nitrogen heteroatom contracts the electron density, reducing
   the magnitude of both the London dispersion and the exchange repulsion
   terms, but with an overall net increase in attraction.
   Finally, using recent advances in SAPT algorithms, researchers can now
   perform SAPT computations on systems with 200 atoms or more. We discuss
   a recent study of the intercalation complex of proflavine with a
   trinucleotide duplex of DNA. Here, London dispersion forces are the
   strongest contributors to binding, as is typical for pi-pi interactions.
   However, the electrostatic terms are larger than usual on a fractional
   basis, which likely results from the positive charge on the intercalator
   and its location between two electron-rich base pairs. These cation-pi
   interactions also increase the induction term beyond those of typical
   noncovalent pi-interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the sources, chemical composition, and spectral
   properties of light-absorbing organic aerosol extracts (i.e., brown
   carbon, or BrC) in the Los Angeles (LA) Basin during the CalNex-2010
   field campaign. Light absorption of PM2.5 water-soluble components at
   365 nm (Abs(365)), used as a proxy for water-soluble BrC, was well
   correlated with water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) (r(2) = 0.55-0.65),
   indicating secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from anthropogenic
   emissions was the major source of water-soluble BrC in this region.
   Normalizing Abs365 to WSOC mass yielded an average solution mass
   absorption efficiency (MAE(365)) of 0.71 m(2)g(-1)C. Detailed chemical
   speciation of filter extracts identified eight nitro-aromatic compounds
   that were correlated with Abs(365). These compounds accounted for
   similar to 4 of the overall water-soluble BrC absorption.
   Methanol-extracted BrC in LA was approximately 3 and 21 times higher
   than water-soluble BrC at 365 and 532 nm, respectively, and had a
   MAE(365) of 1.58 m(2)g(-1)C (Abs(365) normalized to organic carbon
   mass). The water-insoluble BrC was strongly correlated with ambient
   elemental carbon concentration, suggesting similar sources. Absorption
   Angstrom exponent (angstrom(a)) (fitted between 300 and 600 nm
   wavelengths) was 3.2 (+/- 1.2) for the PILS water-soluble BrC
   measurement, compared to 4.8 (+/- 0.5) and 7.6 (+/- 0.5) for methanol-
   and water-soluble BrC from filter extracts, respectively. These results
   show that fine particle BrC was prevalent in the LA basin during CalNex,
   yet many of its properties and potential impacts remain unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Four receptor models and a chemical transport model were used to
   quantify PM2.5 source impacts at the St. Louis Supersite (STL-SS)
   between June 2001 and May 2003. The receptor models used two
   semi-independent data sets, with the first including ions and trace
   elements and the second including 1-in-6 day particle-bound organics.
   Since each source apportionment (SA) technique has limitations, this
   work compares results from the five different SA approaches to better
   understand the biases and limitations of each. The source impacts
   calculated by these models were then integrated into a constrained,
   ensemble-trained SA approach. The ensemble method offers several
   improvements over the five individual SA techniques at the STL-SS.
   Primarily, the ensemble method calculates source impacts on days when
   individual models either do not converge to a solution or do not have
   adequate input data to develop source impact estimates. When compared
   with a chemical mass balance approach using measurement-based source
   profiles, the ensemble method improves fit statistics, reducing
   chi-squared values and improving PM2.5 mass reconstruction. Compared to
   other receptor models, the ensemble method also calculates zero or
   negative impacts from major emissions sources (e.g., secondary organic
   carbon (SOC) and diesel vehicles) for fewer days. One limitation of this
   analysis was that a composite metals profile was used in the ensemble
   analysis. Although STL-SS is impacted by multiple metals processing
   point sources, several of the initial SA methods could not resolve
   individual metals processing impacts. The results of this analysis also
   reveal some of the subjectivities associated with applying specific SA
   models at the STL-SS. For instance, Positive Matrix Factorization
   results are very sensitive to both the fitting species and number of
   factors selected by the user. Conversely, Chemical Mass Balance results
   are sensitive to the source profiles used to represent local metals
   processing emissions. Additionally, the different SA approaches predict
   different impacts for the same source on a given day, with correlation
   coefficients ranging from 0.034 to 0.65 for gasoline vehicles,
   -0.54-0.48 for diesel vehicles, -0.29-0.81 for dust, -0.34-0.89 for
   biomass burning, 0.38-0.49 for metals processing, and -0.25-0.51 for
   SOC. These issues emphasize the value of using several different SA
   techniques at a given receptor site, either by comparing source impacts
   predicted by different models or by using an ensemble-based technique.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the
   major toxicity mechanisms of engineered nanoparticles (NPs). To advance
   our knowledge of the photogeneration of ROS on NPs, this Letter reports
   the ROS generation kinetics of uncoated silver (AgNPs), gold (AuNPs),
   nickel (NiNPs), and silicon (SiNPs) NPs in aqueous suspension under UV
   irradiation (365 nm) and analyzes the potential ROS photogeneration
   mechanisms as well as the associated antibacterial effects. The results
   showed that AgNPs generated superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, whereas
   AuNPs, NiNPs, and SiNPs generated only singlet oxygen. The electronic
   structure and redox potentials of SiNPs were shown to mediate ROS
   generation. By contrast, ROS generation on AuNPs, AgNPs, and NiNPs was
   primarily due to surface plasmon resonance. The antibacterial activities
   of these NPs toward E. coli cells under UV irradiation were AgNPs
   (strongest) > SiNPs > NiNPs > AuNPs. ROS generation and metal ion
   release significantly enhanced the NPs' antibacterial activity.}},

Title = {{Exploiting deep neural networks for detection-based speech recognition}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{148-157}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent years deep neural networks (DNNs) - multilayer perceptrons
   (MLPs) with many hidden layers - have been successfully applied to
   several speech tasks, i.e., phoneme recognition, out of vocabulary word
   detection, confidence measure, etc. In this paper, we show that DNNs can
   be used to boost the classification accuracy of basic speech units, such
   as phonetic attributes (phonological features) and phonemes. This
   boosting leads to higher flexibility and has the potential to integrate
   both top-down and bottom-up knowledge into the Automatic Speech
   Attribute Transcription (ASAT) framework. ASAT is a new family of
   lattice-based speech recognition systems grounded on accurate detection
   of speech attributes. In this paper we compare DNNs and shallow MLPs
   within the ASAT framework to classify phonetic attributes and phonemes.
   Several DNN architectures ranging from five to seven hidden layers and
   up to 2048 hidden units per hidden layer will be presented and
   evaluated. Experimental evidence on the speaker-independent Wall Street
   Journal corpus clearly demonstrates that DNNs can achieve significant
   improvements over the shallow MLPs with a single hidden layer, producing
   greater than 90\% frame-level attribute estimation accuracies for all 21
   phonetic features tested. Similar improvement is also observed on the
   phoneme classification task with excellent frame-level accuracy of
   86.6\% by using DNNs. This improved phoneme prediction accuracy, when
   integrated into a standard large vocabulary continuous speech
   recognition (LVCSR) system through a word lattice rescoring framework,
   results in improved word recognition accuracy, which is better than
   previously reported word lattice rescoring results. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A water resistant, highly robust dimethyl-functionalized UiO-66 analogue
   (UiO-66-DM) has been synthesized and characterized by using N-2
   adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis
   followed by mass spectroscopy. High-pressure (up to 20 bar)
   single-component adsorption isotherm measurements of CO2 and CH4 have
   been performed on UiO-66-DM at different temperatures (293308 K).
   Adsorption isotherm data were modeled by using the Toth equation, and
   isosteric heats of adsorption were calculated by using the
   ClausiusClapeyron equation. The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST)
   was used to calculate mixture selectivities. Water adsorption
   experiments show that water adsorption loadings in UiO-66-DM are reduced
   by almost 50\% compared to the parent material. In the low-pressure
   region, functionalization of the benzenedicarboxylic ligand by
   2,5-dimethyl leads to higher interactions with both CO2 and CH4 compared
   to the parent UiO-66. CO2/CH4 selectivity calculated from IAST is higher

Abstract = {{Intrinsic ethanol/water separation capability of ZIF-8 is characterized
   by a detailed study of adsorption and diffusion of ethanol and water
   vapor in dodecahedral crystals with principle axis dimension of 324,
   15.8, and 0.4 mu m. ZIF-8 exhibits extremely low water uptakes. At 35
   degrees C and a relative pressure (P/P-o) of 0.95, the water uptakes for
   324, 15.8, and 0.4 mu m ZIF-8 are 0.184, 0.197, and 0.503 mmol/g,
   respectively, all of which are less than 1 wt \% increase relative to
   original sorbent mass (0.33, 0.35, 0.91 wt \%). For ethanol adsorption,
   ZIF-8 exhibits an S-shape isotherm with low ethanol uptakes at P/P-o up
   to 0.08 and the cage filling phenomenon occurs at P/P-o higher than
   0.08. The ethanol saturation uptake in ZIF-8 is as high as 30\% of the
   sorbent weight. Because of the existence of the hydrophilic -N-H
   functionality introduced by the terminating imidazolate (Im) linker and
   the overall hydrophobicity of the inner network, the effect of outer
   surface area of ZIF-8 crystals is proved to be non-negligible as ZIF-8
   crystals becomes smaller despite the extremely large inner surface area
   and pore volume, especially for water sorption. The variation of
   isosteric heats of adsorption for water reveals the existence of
   structural defect of ZIF-8 framework. Transport diffusivity and
   corrected diffusivity for water and ethanol in ZIF-8 are determined
   within the entire P/P-o range. The ethanol/water separation performance
   in ZIF-8 is evaluated in terms of vapor. phase sorption selectivity and
   permselectivity. While ZIF-8 exhibits ample ethanol/water sorption
   selectivity, it is not effective for ethanol extraction as a membrane
   material from dilute ethanol aqueous solutions due to the unfavorable
   diffusion selectivity and the competitive water uptakes in the adsorbed
   ethanol phase.}},

   carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 1.78(2)
   to 11.2(2) nm. Debye (theta(D)) and Einstein (theta(E)) temperatures
   were extracted from temperature-dependent PDF peak widths. A monotonic
   decrease in (theta(D)) with nanoparticle diameter was found and could be
   well explained by the effect of increased surface area except in the
   case of the 1.78(2) nm diameter nanoparticle where the measured Debye
   temperature is significantly depressed from that predicted. This
   suggests an anomalous bond softening in the smallest sample.}},

Abstract = {{Facile methods for controlling the microstructure of polymeric
   semiconductors are critical to the success of large area flexible
   electronics. Here we explore ultrasonic irradiation of solutions of
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a simple route to creating ordered
   molecular aggregates that result in a one to two order of magnitude
   improvement in field effect mobility. A detailed investigation of the
   ultrasound induced phenomenon, including the role of solvent, polymer
   regioregularity (RR) and film deposition method, is conducted.
   Absorption spectroscopy reveals that the development of low energy
   vibronic features is dependent on both the regioregularity as well as
   the solvent, with the latter especially influential on the intensity and
   shape of the band. Use of either higher regioregular polymer or
   ultrasonic irradiation of lower regioregular polymer solutions results
   in high field effect mobilities that are nearly independent of the
   dynamics of the film formation process. Surprisingly, no distinct
   correlation between thin-film morphology and macroscopic charge
   transport could be ascertained. The relationships between molecular and
   process parameters are very subtle: modulation of one effects changes in
   the others, which in turn impact charge transport on the macroscale. Our
   results provide insight into the degree of control that is required for
   the development of reproducible, robust materials and processes for
   advanced flexible electronics based on polymeric materials.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-high-speed optical communication systems which can support >=
   1Tb/s per channel transmission will soon be required to meet the
   increasing capacity demand. However, 1Tb/s over a single carrier
   requires either or both a high-level modulation format (i.e. 1024QAM)
   and a high baud rate. Alternatively, grouping a number of tightly spaced
   ``sub-carriers{''} to form a terabit superchannel increases channel
   capacity while minimizing the need for high-level modulation formats and
   high baud rate, which may allow existing formats, baud rate and
   components to be exploited. In ideal Nyquist-WDM superchannel systems,
   optical subcarriers with rectangular spectra are tightly packed at a
   channel spacing equal to the baud rate, thus achieving the Nyquist
   bandwidth limit. However, in practical Nyquist-WDM systems, precise
   electrical or optical control of channel spectra is required to avoid
   strong inter-channel interference (ICI). Here, we propose and
   demonstrate a new ``super receiver{''} architecture for practical
   Nyquist-WDM systems, which jointly detects and demodulates multiple
   channels simultaneously and mitigates the penalties associated with the
   limitations of generating ideal Nyquist-WDM spectra. Our receiver-side
   solution relaxes the filter requirements imposed on the transmitter. Two
   joint DSP algorithms are developed for linear ICI cancellation and joint
   carrier-phase recovery. Improved system performance is observed with
   both experimental and simulation data. Performance analysis under
   different system configurations is conducted to demonstrate the
   feasibility and robustness of the proposed joint DSP algorithms. (c)

Abstract = {{Microsized calcium carbonates, including precipitated and ground calcium
   carbonates have been widely used in paper industry. One of the most
   interesting perspectives to filler technology is the development of
   nano-sized, high performance, and low cost fillers. However, due to the
   high cost of nano-sized filler, it is critically important to develop a
   technique that achieve this perspective. The main goals of this study
   were to prepare unmodified and CTAB modified nano-calcium carbonate
   fillers. The effect of CaO concentration, CO2 flow rate and CTAB
   surfactant on size and morphology of the prepared CaCO3 particles were
   investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope
   (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), zeta potential and Fourier
   transformer infra-red (FT-IR) were used for the characterization of the
   prepared nano-sized calcium carbonate particles. The results showed that
   the obtained calcium carbonate was calcite phase. The particle sizes and
   morphologies of CaCO3 varied from rhombohedral (15-35 nm) to
   scalenohedral (400 nm in diameter and 2 mu m length) with changing the
   operating variables, CaO concentration, CO2 flow rate and surfactants
   concentration. CTAB neutralized the negative surface charge developed at
   the CaCO3 surface and the zeta potential approached to zero. On the
   other hand, the suggested mechanism of CTAB for synthesis of
   nano-calcium carbonate was also studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (p-DADMAC) increases the rate of
   alpha-amylase-induced cornstarch liquefaction, thereby reducing the
   enzyme dose necessary for optimal hydrolysis. A similar increase is also
   provided by cationic polyacrylamides (c-PAMs), but p-DADMAC offers the
   added industrial benefits of lower cost, a lower catalytic
   concentration, and a much lower residual in distillers dry grain.
   p-DADMAC also increases enzyme-substrate binding, lowers the onset
   temperature of gelatinization, and reduces the viscosity of the
   gelatinized cornstarch. It is proposed that most of these benefits
   result from the higher charge density of p-DADMAC, which neutralizes the
   negative charge on the cornstarch at a lower polymer dose. The higher
   charge also inhibits the agglomeration of starch through charge
   reversal. These attributes of p-DADMAC offer cost and performance
   benefits that can be realized in existing corn ethanol facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose-based nanocomposites could potentially function as structural
   materials for prosthetic vascular conduits given their moldability,
   mechanical strength in the wet state, stability, and durability as well
   as their ability to integrate a nanofibrous porous network with superior
   structural diversity and functional versatility. In this study, we have
   developed a cellulose-based nanocomposite consisting of cellulose
   nanowhiskers (CNWs) embedded and aligned in a cellulose acetate
   propionate (CAP) matrix. When compared to non-biocompatible inclusions
   such as carbon nanotubes and Kevlar fillers, CNWs imparted significant
   strength and directional rigidity to the CNW-CAP composite even at 0.2
   wt\%. In addition, a significant improvement in critical properties was
   observed when the CNWs were aligned in an externally-applied relatively
   weak magnetic field (0.3 T). Magnetically induced alignment not only
   improved the directionality and percolation limits of the nanoparticles
   within the medium, but also drastically lowered the optimum amount of
   CNWs required to obtain the best composite performance. Therefore,
   highly desirable properties can be induced in cellulose-based
   biocompatible composites by modifying the processing methods, with
   potential use as scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering of a small
   diameter graft. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A vision-aided inertial navigation system that enables autonomous flight

   proposed for performing the tasks of vision-based mapping and navigation
   separately. When GPS is available, multiple observations of a single
   landmark point from the vision sensor are used to estimate the point's
   location in inertial space. When GPS is not available, points that have
   been sufficiently mapped out can be used for estimating vehicle position
   and attitude. Simulation and flight test results of a vehicle operating
   autonomously in a simplified loss-of-GPS scenario verify the presented

Abstract = {{The coefficient of friction (COF) has a large influence on the material
   response due to fretting, and the value of the COF evolves during
   fretting. Friction is usually low for early cycles and increases to
   reach a stabilized value at locations where slip occurs between the
   contacting bodies. Of the fretting studies utilizing the finite element
   method to evaluate fretting damage metrics, only one has accounted for
   the evolution of friction. The majority of studies have used a constant
   COF equal to the stabilized value. This is not appropriate for low cycle
   cases where the COF is transient for the majority of the duration or for
   high cycle cases where the changes in COF affect the stabilized cyclic
   stress strain response due to the history dependence of the material
   behavior. The evolution of the COF is caused by the modification of the
   interface between contacting materials as a result of wear processes.
   The wear process changes with cycling, and progresses from initial
   roughening from metal to metal contact, followed by accumulation of
   debris, followed by saturation of the debris quantity and morphology and
   a stabilized response. These processes are each associated with energy
   dissipation, which can therefore be related to the COF evolution. In
   this study, a simple expression for the evolution of the COF has been
   developed that is dependent on accumulated frictional energy dissipation
   density. This allows the COF to be modified in a finite element model as
   a function of history and location based on an experimentally measured
   relationship between energy dissipation and COF. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This study reports on an ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide as a promising engine lubricant
   candidate. This IL has a relatively low viscosity of 4.7 cSt (similar to
   0W-10 racing engine oil), a low viscosity-pressure (V-P) coefficient of
   6.5 GPa(-1) at 100 degrees C, a high viscosity index of 159, and a high
   onset decomposition temperature of 472 degrees C. The ionic liquid
   delivers substantially lower friction in mixed lubrication (ML) and
   provides better scuffing protection in boundary lubrication (BL) than
   those of hydrocarbon lubricants with similar viscosities. The low ML
   friction is possibly attributed to its low V-P coefficient and a
   hypothetical multi-layer boundary film at the interface. In BL, the
   tribochemical reactions between the IL and the contact surfaces to form
   a protective tribo-film are believed to be responsible for the IL's
   superior anti-scuffing behavior. Microstructural examination and
   chemical composition analysis were conducted on the wear scars from both
   the top surface and the cross section to study the wear mode and
   characterize the tribo-film and near-surface structure. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) technology has been developed to solve the

   opportunities to access the licensed spectrum bands assigned to the

   CR users are not allowed to generate unacceptable interference to them.
   In this paper, we investigate power allocation schemes for CR networks
   with both direct and relay-aided transmissions. We first formulate an
   overall rate optimization problem with interference constraints to the
   PU and peak power constraints at each node and obtain solutions by
   theoretical analysis. To take the fairness among CR users into
   consideration, we further investigate the overall rate optimization
   problem with an additional sum power constraint and achieve fairness
   between two CR users by adjusting the sum power threshold. Numerical
   results are provided to show the impact of the relay node and the PU

Abstract = {{Scheduling can obtain multi-user diversity if channel state information
   (CSI) is known, such as for low-mobility users and can exploit frequency
   diversity if CSI is not available at the transmitter, such as for
   high-mobility users. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation
   exploiting frequency and multi-user diversity for LTE downlink systems
   with users of different mobilities. To facilitate resource allocation,
   we first develop a user classification algorithm to identify high-and
   low-mobility users. Based on user mobility classification, we then
   propose a scheduling algorithm to simultaneously obtain multi-user
   diversity for those low-mobility users and frequency diversity for those
   high-mobility users. It is demonstrated by computer simulation that the
   performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm provides 6\% and 23\%
   gain of overall cell throughput, and 5.6\% and 18\% gain of 10th
   percentile throughput over proportional fairness based
   frequency-selective and frequency-diversity scheduling algorithms,
   respectively. Furthermore, the proposed scheduling algorithm has the
   same order of computational complexity as the frequency-selective
   scheduling algorithm.}},

   phenotypes through biochemical modifications without altering the
   underlying DNA sequence. In humans, DNA methylation is a major
   epigenetic modification that adds a methyl group mainly to the carbon-5
   position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring in the cytosine guanine
   dinucleotide. This epigenetic modification is crucial to normal
   development and cellular differentiation as well as a number of key
   processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation,
   suppression of repetitive elements, and tumorigenesis. Recently, a lot
   of resources and efforts have been devoted to the DNA methylation
   profiling of human genome based on biochemical experiments or
   computational prediction. Here, we provide a review on these
   experimental and computational techniques, and large-scaled DNA
   methylation data sets and databases. While the description of the
   biochemical techniques is mainly to provide an overview of the
   biological background, we focus more on the computational techniques,
   particularly on the data resources, methodologies and problems that have
   been studied. Our goal is to provide a guidance for future
   bioinformatics research on DNA methylation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the statistical properties of the method of
   regularization with radial basis functions in the context of linear
   inverse problems. Radial basis function regularization is widely used in
   machine learning because of its demonstrated effectiveness in numerous
   applications and computational advantages. From a statistical viewpoint,
   one of the main advantages of radial basis function regularization in
   general and Gaussian radial basis function regularization in particular
   is their ability to adapt to varying degrees of smoothness in a direct
   problem. We show here that similar approaches for inverse problems not
   only share such adaptivity to the smoothness of the signal but also can
   accommodate different degrees of ill-posedness. Thee results render
   further theoretical support to the superior performance observed
   empirically for radial basis function regularization. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{721}},
Pages = {{484-513}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes analyses of the nonlinear dynamics of harmonically
   forced, turbulent premixed flames. A key objective of this work is to
   analyse the ensemble-averaged dynamics of the flame front position, <xi
   >, excited by harmonic forcing of amplitude epsilon, in the presence of
   stochastic flow fluctuations of amplitude mu. Low-amplitude and/or
   near-field effects are quantified by a third-order perturbation
   analysis, while the more general case is analysed computationally by
   solving the three-dimensional level-set equation, extracting the
   instantaneous flame position, and ensemble averaging the results. We
   show that different mechanisms contribute to smoothing of flame
   wrinkles, manifested as progressive decay in the magnitude of <xi >.
   Near the flame holder, random phase jitter, associated with stochastic
   velocity fluctuations tangential to the flame, is dominant. Farther
   downstream, propagation of the ensemble-averaged front normal to itself
   at the time-averaged turbulent burning velocity, (S-T,S-eff) over bar,
   leads to destruction of wrinkles, analogous to the laminar case, an
   effect that scales with mu. A second, new result is the demonstration
   that the ensemble-averaged turbulent burning velocity, S-T,S-eff(s, t),
   is modulated by the harmonic forcing, i.e. S-T,S-eff(s, t) =
   <(S-T,S-eff(s))over bar> + S-T,S-eff'(s, t), where S-T,S-eff' has an
   inverse dependence upon the instantaneous, ensemble averaged-flame
   curvature, an effect that scales with epsilon and mu. We show that this
   curvature dependence follows from basic application of Huygens
   propagation to flames with stochastic wrinkling superimposed upon base
   curvature. This effect also leads to smoothing of flame wrinkles and is
   analogous to stretch processes in positive-Markstein-length, laminar
   flames.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of radial flow during retreating blade stall on a two-bladed
   teetering rotor with cyclic pitch variation is investigated using laser
   sheet visualization and particle image velocimetry in a low-speed wind
   tunnel. The velocity field above the retreating blade at 2700 azimuth
   shows the expected development of a radially directed jet layer close to
   the blade surface in the otherwise separated flow region. This jet is
   observed to break up into discrete structures, limiting the spanwise
   growth of the radial velocity in the jet layer. The discrete structures
   are shown to derive their vorticity from the ``radial jet{''} layer near
   the surface, rather than from the freestream at the edge of the
   separated region. The separation line determined using velocity data
   shows the expected spanwise variation. The results of this study are
   also correlated in a limited range of extrapolation to the phenomena

Abstract = {{One of the crucial characteristics of a porous medium is its relative
   density rho{*}, i.e. the volume fraction of the solid. For example, in
   low density foams (rho{*} < 0.1) the macroscopic material properties
   depend on the foam geometry only through the relative density. The
   relative density of nanoporous (NP) metal foams synthesized by
   dealloying is typically in the range rho{*} >= 0.4. This places NP metal
   foams in a previously unexplored parameter regime and necessitates
   reexamination of scaling laws derived for low density foams. In this
   work we demonstrate that the modulus of NP metal foams does not exhibit
   a clear correlation with the relative density. We trace this apparent
   disagreement with existing scaling laws to the agglomeration of mass in
   the junctions. We then derive and verify a new scaling relationship for
   the dependence of relative density and relative modulus on the geometric
   parameters such as strut thickness, length and junction size. We find
   good agreement between our model and experimental measurements for
   single crystal gold NP foams with large junction sizes. In contrast,
   polycrystalline NP platinum with nanosized grains within the struts
   shows an enhancement in the modulus that cannot be attributed to the
   foam geometry only. Based on this analysis, we infer a more than an
   order of magnitude enhancement of the modulus of the nanograined Pt
   struts compared to bulk platinum. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{In a previous work {[}Acta Materialia 2012;60:4787], we developed a new
   method that utilizes discrete, voxel-based data for microstructure
   quantification. We successfully calculated some relatively simple
   microstructural quantities and relations. In this paper, we apply and
   extend this method to compute more complex microstructural quantities
   and, in particular, map out the connection between grain growth rate and
   various topological properties. We present detailed results for several
   local and average topological and geometric properties of the
   microstructures during grain coarsening, including the curvature of
   grain boundaries and triple junction lines, grain cell shape, and their
   relations with growth dynamics. We also examine several well-known
   topological relations, i.e. Euler relations, the Lewis rule and the
   Aboav-Weaire law. These quantities and relations are the centerpiece of
   the grain growth models and theories developed so far. We also compare
   our results with some existing results in three dimensions. The
   quantitative description of the dynamic behaviors of the microstructural
   attributes adds a valuable data set to grain growth that can be used for
   benchmarking for phase field modeling and comparison with other

Abstract = {{Amine-loaded hollow fiber sorbents for CO2 capture from dilute gas
   streams are created using a novel post-spinning amine-infusion
   technique. This technique infuses poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) into
   cellulose acetate/mesoporous silica hollow fiber sorbents during the
   solvent exchange steps after dry-jet, wet-quench, non-solvent induced
   phase separation spinning. A suitable post-spinning infusing solution
   was found to be 10\% PEI in methanol with an infusion time of 4 h. After
   amine infusion, the 51 wt\% silica hollow fiber sorbents are
   demonstrated to have a nitrogen loading of 0.52 mmol/g-fiber and a CO2
   uptake of 1.2 mmol/g-fiber, at equilibrium. Amine-loaded fibers are
   packaged into a shell-and-tube module and exposed on the shell side to
   simulated flue gas with an inert tracer (10 mol\% CO2, 80 mol\% N-2 and
   10 mol\% He at 100\% relative humidity; 1 atm, 35 degrees C). The fibers
   are shown to have a breakthrough CO2 capacity of 0.58 mmol/g-fiber and
   CO2 uptake after 20 min of 0.92 mmol/g-fiber (1 atm and 35 degrees C).
   Under the same conditions, the water uptake was found to be 3.2
   mmol/g-fiber. The preparation of amine-containing polymeric hollow
   fibers and demonstration of their CO2 adsorption properties is an
   important step towards realizing new, scalable process configurations
   for supported amine sorbents relevant to post-combustion CO2 capture.

Abstract = {{Videogrammetry is an inexpensive and easy-to-use technology for spatial
   3D scene recovery. When applied to large scale civil infrastructure
   scenes, only a small percentage of the collected video frames are
   required to achieve robust results. However, choosing the right frames
   requires careful consideration. Videotaping a built infrastructure scene
   results in large video files filled with blurry, noisy, or redundant
   frames. This is due to frame rate to camera speed ratios that are often
   higher than necessary; camera and lens imperfections and limitations
   that result in imaging noise; and occasional jerky motions of the camera
   that result in motion blur; all of which can significantly affect the
   performance of the videogrammetric pipeline. To tackle these issues,
   this paper proposes a novel method for automating the selection of an
   optimized number of informative, high quality frames. According to this
   method, as the first step, blurred frames are removed using the
   thresholds determined based on a minimum level of frame quality required
   to obtain robust results. Then, an optimum number of key frames are
   selected from the remaining frames using the selection criteria devised
   by the authors. Experimental results show that the proposed method
   outperforms existing methods in terms of improved 3D reconstruction
   results, while maintaining the optimum number of extracted frames needed
   to generate high quality 3D point clouds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), security and energy consumption have
   been considered as long-lasting technical challenges as sensors usually
   suffer from complexity and energy constraints. In this paper, we study a
   simple and efficient physical-layer security to provide data
   confidentiality in a distributed detection scenario. In particular, to
   prevent passive eavesdropping on transmitting data from sensors to an
   ally fusion center (AFC), we propose a novel encryption scheme and
   decision fusion rules for a parallel access channel model. The proposed
   scheme takes advantage of a free natural resource, i.e., randomness of
   wireless channels, to encrypt the binary local decision of each sensor
   in such a way that the binary local decision is flipped according to
   instantaneous channel gain between the sensor and AFC. The
   location-specific and reciprocal properties of wireless channels enable
   the sensor and AFC to share the inherent randomness of wireless channels
   which are not available to an eavesdropper. Furthermore, it is shown
   that the scheme is well-suited to a low complexity and energy efficient
   modulation technique, noncoherent binary frequency shift keying. To
   evaluate performances of the proposed scheme, log-likelihood-ratio-based
   decision fusion strategies at the AFC are analyzed, and comparisons of
   decision performances are carried out. In addition, we prove that the
   proposed scheme achieves perfect secrecy with a simple structure that is
   suited for sensors of limited complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Micro rotorcraft have a great potential for both civilian and military
   applications, but for successful deployment, they must operate robustly
   in real-world environments including flight in winds. Due to their small
   size, common wind fields in and around buildings can represent a large
   percentage of the vehicle's full flight envelope resulting in highly
   non-linear motion. An experimental method has been developed to evaluate
   the capabilities of micro rotorcraft in realistic wind conditions to aid
   in the design and evaluation of these vehicles. A synthetic wind
   generation system is used to create repeatable and controllable gust
   excitations, and a motion capture system is used for precise measurement
   of vehicle response. Performance metrics associated with the accuracy of
   position tracking and angular rate excursions are proposed to quantify
   vehicle capabilities at different excitation levels for design
   assessment and cross-platform comparison. To demonstrate the
   experimental method, test results are shown to evaluate the capabilities
   of a micro coaxial helicopter in realistic winds as a function of gust
   excitation level and vehicle size. For this example system, light wind
   gusts degrade hover hold accuracy by a factor of 3 compared to a
   situation with quiescent winds.}},

Abstract = {{The interface trap density (D-it) and bonding at the Al2O3/InP interface

   measurements show a peak near midgap and a tail, which extends into the
   InP conduction band. After post high-k deposition annealing, only midgap
   D-it increases while minimal change in conduction band D-it is observed.
   The magnitude of extracted D-it is higher for the Al2O3/InP interface
   compared to the HfO2/InP interface. XPS analysis shows that the native
   oxides at the Al2O3/InP interface are more phosphorous rich than for
   HfO2/InP interface. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We present a simple cryostat purpose built for use with
   surface-electrode ion traps, designed around an affordable, large
   cooling power commercial pulse tube refrigerator. A modular vacuum
   enclosure with a single vacuum space facilitates interior access and
   enables rapid turnaround and flexibility for future modifications. Long
   rectangular windows provide nearly 360 degrees of optical access in the
   plane of the ion trap, while a circular bottom window near the trap
   enables NA 0.4 light collection without the need for in-vacuum optics.
   We evaluate the system's mechanical and thermal characteristics and we
   quantify ion trapping performance by trapping Ca-40(+), finding small
   stray electric fields, long ion lifetimes, and low ion heating rates.

Abstract = {{Mechanical degradation of the electrode materials during electrochemical
   cycling remains a serious issue that critically limits the capacity
   retention and cyclability of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Here we
   report the highly reversible expansion and contraction of germanium
   nanoparticles under lithiation-delithiation cycling with in situ
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). During multiple cycles to the
   full capacity, the germanium nanoparticles remained robust without any
   visible cracking despite similar to 260\% volume changes, in contrast to
   the size-dependent fracture of silicon nanoparticles upon the first
   lithiation. The comparative in situ TEM study of fragile silicon
   nanoparticles suggests that the tough behavior of germanium
   nanoparticles can be attributed to the weak anisotropy of the lithiation
   strain at the reaction front. The tough germanium nanoparticles offer
   substantial potential for the development of durable, high-capacity, and
   high-rate anodes for advanced lithium-ion batteries.}},

   (TENG) with extremely low cost, simple structure, small size (3.8 an x
   3.8 cm x 0.95 cm) and lightweight (7 g) by innovatively integrating five
   layers of units on a single flexible substrate. Owing to the unique
   structure and nanopore-based surface modification on the metal surface,
   the instantaneous short-circuit current (I-sc) and the open-circuit
   voltage (V-oc) could reach 0.66 mA and 215 V with an instantaneous
   maximum power density of 9.8 mW/cm(2) and 1024 mW/cm(3). This is the
   first 3D integrated TENG for enhancing the output power. Triggered by
   press from normal walking, the TENG attached onto a shoe pad was able to
   instantaneously drive multiple commercial LED bulbs. With the flexible
   structure, the TENG can be further integrated into clothes or even
   attached onto human body without introducing sensible obstruction and

Abstract = {{A comprehensive scale-up procedure for amine-functionalized UiO-66 is
   implemented, which leads to the development of a novel flow-through
   metal-organic framework synthesis process. Products are characterized
   via BET modeling of N-2 adsorption at 77 K and powder XRD to confirm
   crystal porosity and phase, respectively. Batch syntheses are conducted
   to examine the effects of polytetrafluoroethylene and glass vessel
   materials on crystal yield and quality. Intermediate samples from
   sealed-vessel trials at 373, 383, and 393 K are collected and
   characterized, which show a high degree of product consistency.
   Nucleation rates are determined at the same temperatures, and the
   Arrhenius relationship is used to predict the activation energy of
   nucleation, E-aNuc. A continuous-flow reactive crystallization process
   is developed using a draft-tube type reactor. As a proof of concept, the
   reactor is operated for three retention times. The cumulative product,
   material retained within the crystallizer, and intermediate samples are
   collected and characterized to confirm UiO-66-NH2 production. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A new exploratory procedure for collecting continuous shear wave
   velocity measurements via cone penetration testing using a special

Abstract = {{This paper presents a block-overlap-based validity metric for use as a
   measure of motion vector (MV) validity and to improve the quality of the
   motion field. In contrast to other validity metrics in the literature,
   the proposed metric is not sensitive to image features and does not
   require the use of neighboring MVs or manual thresholds. Using a hybrid
   de-interlacer, it is shown that the proposed metric outperforms other
   block-based validity metrics in the literature. To help regularize the
   ill-posed nature of motion estimation, the proposed validity metric is
   also used as a regularizer in an energy minimization framework to
   determine the optimal MV. Experimental results show that the proposed
   energy minimization framework outperforms several existing motion
   estimation methods in the literature in terms of MV and interpolation
   quality. For interpolation quality, our algorithm outperforms all other
   block-based methods as well as several complex optical flow methods. In
   addition, it is one of the fastest implementations at the time of this

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding, endogenous RNA molecules that
   play important roles in a variety of normal and diseased biological
   processes by post-transcriptionally regulating the expression of target
   genes. They can bind to target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts of
   protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause
   mRNA degradation. miRNAs have been found to actively regulate a variety
   of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, death, and
   metabolism. Therefore, their study is crucial for the better
   understanding of cellular functions in eukaryotes. To better understand
   the mechanisms of miRNA: mRNA interaction and their cellular functions,
   it is important to identify the miRNA targets accurately. In this paper,
   we provide a brief review for the advances in the animal miRNA target

   in a specific case study by examining concrete activities at the
   operational front of the collection and recycling system, and probing
   the varying stakeholder preferences that have driven a specific system
   to its status quo. To this end, we conduct a detailed case study of the
   Washington State EPR implementation for electronic waste. We provide an
   overview of various stakeholder perspectives and their implications for
   the attainment of EPR policy objectives in practice. These findings shed
   light on the intrinsic complexity of EPR implementation. We conclude
   with recommendations on how to achieve effective and efficient EPR
   implementation, including improving design incentives, incorporating
   reuse and refurbishing, expanding product scope, managing downstream
   material flows, and promoting operational efficiency via fair cost

Abstract = {{Single grit diamond scribing experiments were carried out to understand
   the effects of SiC and Si3N4 inclusions in diamond wire sawing or
   cutting of photovoltaic multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) substrate

   significantly increase the cutting force and lead to large scale
   localized brittle fracture of the mc-Si substrate. In contrast, SiC
   filament-type inclusions do not affect the scribing/cutting process.
   Si3N4 fibers are found to be flexible and are not cut by diamond
   scribing. Explanations for the observations are given based on the
   material properties of mc-Si, diamond and inclusions. The detrimental
   effects of SiC and Si3N4 inclusions on diamond wire sawing are also

Abstract = {{Hybrid nanoparticles with complex architectures combine the properties

   particles. We use a templating technique wherein the microgel coating is
   applied from a high-volume-fraction colloidal phase, leading to high
   surface coverage and enhanced colloidal stability of the resultant
   particles. Concentrated colloidal dispersions enable microgel/core
   combinations driven by both specific and nonspecific interactions and
   offer improved coverage relative to dilute heteroaggregation. This
   approach is versatile and allows both the core material and microgel
   phase to be altered while still remaining effective. Though the
   recovered particles are highly diluted, recycling the unincorporated
   microgels following raspberry-like particle isolation and reforming the
   packed colloidal assembly allow multiple cycles of particle synthesis,

Abstract = {{The performance of a system depends heavily on the communication speed
   between integrated circuits. Single-ended signaling is widely used for
   memory interface, but it suffers from simultaneous switching noise,
   crosstalk, and reference voltage noise. Even with other signaling
   schemes that remedy the shortcomings of the singled-ended signaling,
   there still is a limitation in terms of noise reduction due to the power
   delivery network (PDN). These include techniques such as differential
   signaling. The disruption between the power and ground planes based on
   the low target impedance concept induces return path discontinuities
   during the data transitions, which create displacement current sources
   between the power and ground planes. These sources induce excessive
   power supply noise which can only be reduced by increasing the
   capacitance requirements. The new PDN design proposed in this paper
   using power transmission lines (PTLs) enables both power and signal
   transmission lines to be referenced to the same ground plane so that a
   continuous current path can be formed. A modified balanced signaling
   scheme is applied to PTL, and called as pseudo-balanced PTL (PBPTL). The
   PBPTL scheme reduces the overhead caused by the conventional balanced
   signaling scheme and addresses the issues associated with PTL. Extensive
   simulations and measurements are shown using the PTL approach to
   demonstrate the enhanced signal integrity as compared to the currently
   practiced approaches.}},

   to develop exponentially decaying bounds on the tracking error and

Abstract = {{It is increasingly being recognized that resting state brain
   connectivity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data is an important marker of brain function both in healthy and
   clinical populations. Though linear correlation has been extensively
   used to characterize brain connectivity, it is limited to detecting
   first order dependencies. In this study, we propose a framework where in
   phase synchronization (PS) between brain regions is characterized using
   a new metric ``correlation between probabilities of recurrence{''} (CPR)
   and subsequent graph-theoretic analysis of the ensuing networks. We
   applied this method to resting state fMRI data obtained from human
   subjects with and without administration of propofol anesthetic. Our
   results showed decreased PS during anesthesia and a biologically more
   plausible community structure using CPR rather than linear correlation.
   We conclude that CPR provides an attractive nonparametric method for
   modeling interactions in brain networks as compared to standard
   correlation for obtaining physiologically meaningful insights about
   brain function.}},

Title = {{The physics of modeling unsteady flaps with gaps}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{255-272}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Research indicates that active control concepts have promise in
   mitigating numerous adverse phenomena associated with the aeromechanics
   of lifting surfaces. These techniques are being applied to delay stall
   of fixed wing aircraft, as well as to eliminate or mitigate vibratory
   loads, blade-vortex interaction, and dynamic stall of the flow about
   rotorcraft and wind turbine blades. These phenomena are nonlinear and
   unsteady for dynamic systems, which add yet another layer of complexity
   on the physics of the flow. While a plethora of different active control
   techniques is being explored, the use of trailing edge flaps appears to
   be one of the more viable and cost-effective concepts. Static
   multi-element airfoils and wings have been analyzed computationally, but
   little exists on the ability to model these when the airfoil and flap
   are dynamic. The costs associated with modeling the gap between the
   airfoil and flap have led to approximations where the flap is modeled
   only as a morphed tip of the airfoil (no gap). Using a hybrid
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes/Large-Eddy-Simulation turbulence
   technique, an oscillating flapped airfoil has been studied to determine
   the influence of modeling the gap on the performance and acoustic
   signature of the airfoil. Results are compared with the experimental
   data to confirm the validity of the computational approach. Both
   attached and separated (dynamic stall) oscillating flows are examined.
   The physics within the gap are found to be important for the airfoil
   performance when stall is encountered, as well as when acoustic
   signatures are required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microspheres serve as convenient substrates for studying DNA activity on
   surfaces. Here, in addition to employing conventional sample preparation
   involving multiple wash and resuspension steps prior to flow cytometry
   measurements, we also directly sampled the reaction volume to acquire in
   situ measurements of primary and competitive hybridization events. Even
   in the absence of post hybridization wash steps, nonspecific binding
   events were negligible and thus allowed for direct, quantitative
   assessment of hybridization events as they occurred on colloidal
   surfaces. The in situ results indicate that primary duplex formation
   between immobilized probes and soluble targets on microsphere surfaces
   is less favorable than predicted by solution models. The kinetics of
   competitive displacement of primary hybridization partners by secondary
   targets measured in situ or post washing also deviate from expectations
   based on theoretical solution thermodynamics, but are consistent with
   predicted kinetic trends stemming from differences in either the toehold
   base length or branch migration.}},

   reduction rate of a Pd precursor, and thus the final size, size
   distribution, and morphology of the Pd seeds. By taking advantage of the
   coordination effect of Br ions with Pd2+ ions and their selective
   adsorption on the Pd(100) surface, Pd nanocrystals with a number of
   distinct shapes could be conveniently produced by varying the
   concentration of KBr added into the growth solution. This work provides
   a general and facile method for the green synthesis of Pd nanocrystals

Abstract = {{Accounting for waterway vessel collision is required in the structural
   design of bridges spanning navigable waterways. During collision events,
   massive waterway vessel groups such as barge flotillas are capable of
   dynamically transmitting horizontal forces to impacted bridge
   components. Furthermore, collision-induced forces can be sufficient to
   collapse piers or roadway spans in the vicinity of the impact location.
   If collapse takes place, economic loss is suffered because of subsequent
   traffic rerouting and bridge replacement costs. Additionally, fatalities
   may occur if the roadway is occupied during or shortly after collapse.
   This paper focuses on the development of a probability of collapse
   expression for bridge piers subject to barge impact loading, where the
   relationship can be readily integrated into existing bridge design
   methodologies. The expression is developed by employing probabilistic
   descriptions for a multitude of random variables related to barge
   traffic characteristics and bridge structures in conjunction with
   nonlinear dynamic finite-element analyses of barge-bridge collisions.
   Highly efficient, advanced probabilistic simulation techniques are
   necessarily incorporated into the barge-bridge collision analysis
   framework to allow feasible estimation of structural reliability
   parameters. These parameters facilitate the formation of an expression
   that, in turn, bridge designers can use to estimate probabilities of
   structural collapse attributable to barge collision, without performing
   probabilistic analyses. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000376. (C)

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel method for producing polystyrene (PS)-grafted
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which provides a direct route to
   composites where carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the major component.
   Infrared and Raman spectroscopies confirmed that the MWCNTs were
   functionalized with PS. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that CNTs
   increase thermal stability of the composite up to a critical loading
   (similar to 40 wt\%) beyond which high nanotube loadings decrease the
   polymer degradation temperature, as a consequence of the thermal
   properties of CNTs and the composite morphology. Even at loadings as
   high as 80 wt\% MWCNTs, the composite is an effective masterbatch
   material for both solution-and melt-processing. These results show that
   in situ polymerizations can be flexible and robust techniques for
   nanocomposite processing, overcoming limitations of conventional
   processing techniques to produce nanocomposites with very high nanotube
   loadings, not achieved hitherto.}},

   thiol-ene-acrylate systems showed rapid polymerization with low apparent

   with excellent patternability, while a binary acrylate system shows
   extreme apparent shrinkage, greater heat evolution, and does not
   replicate the mask pattern in a controllable fashion. The apparent
   shrinkage is a measure of patternability, since this quantity represents
   the actual polymer dimensions when compared to the desired dimension

Title = {{Comparison of the Stress Distribution and Fatigue Behavior of 10- and

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The stress distribution and fatigue behavior of nominally identical
   kilohertz fatigue resonators with two different thicknesses, 10 and 25
   mu m, was compared in this study. The results highlight the non-uniform
   3-D stress distribution of the micron-scale notched cantilever beams
   that depends on the thickness. The areas corresponding to the first
   principal stress being within 2\% of the maximum value are much smaller
   than the overall notch area and are a function of device thickness. It
   is also shown that the non-negligible influence of small,
   nanometer-scale geometrical variations in the dimensions of nominally
   identical devices on the maximum stress values can be accounted for by
   measuring the device's resonant frequency (f(0)). The observed scatter
   in the fatigue results of these microresonators is in part associated
   with the challenge in accurately calculating the local stress
   amplitudes. Despite that large scatter, the fatigue behavior of the 10
   and 25 mu m thick devices is similar. Particularly, the overall relative
   decrease rates in f(0) are well related to fatigue life (N-f) and can be
   used to predict N-f within a factor of 5, for N-f ranging from 10(4) to
   10(10) cycles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details an algorithm to simultaneously perform registration
   of computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam computed (CBCT) images, and
   image enhancement of CBCT. The algorithm employs a viscous fluid model
   which naturally incorporates two components: a similarity measure for
   registration and an intensity correction term for image enhancement.
   Incorporating an intensity correction term improves the registration
   results. Furthermore, applying the image enhancement term to CBCT
   imagery leads to an intensity corrected CBCT with better image quality.
   To achieve minimal processing time, the algorithm is implemented on a
   graphic processing unit (CPU) platform. The advantage of the
   simultaneous optimization strategy is quantitatively validated and
   discussed using a synthetic example. The effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm is then illustrated using six patient datasets, three
   head-and-neck datasets and three prostate datasets. Published by

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle (NP)-bioconjugates hold great promise for more sensitive
   disease diagnosis and more effective anticancer drug delivery compared
   with existing approaches. A critical aspect in both applications is
   cellular internalization of NPs, which is influenced by NP properties
   and cell surface mechanics. Despite considerable progress in
   optimization of the NPbioconjugates for improved targeting, the role of
   substrate stiffness on cellular uptake has not been investigated. Using
   polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels as model substrates with tunable
   stiffness, we quantified the relationship between substrate stiffiless
   and cellular uptake of fluorescent NPs by bovine aortic endothelial
   cells (BAECs). We found that a stiffer substrate results in a higher
   total cellular uptake on a per cell basis, but a lower uptake per unit
   membrane area. To obtain a mechanistic understanding of the cellular
   uptake behavior, we developed a thermodynamic model that predicts that
   membrane spreading area and cell membrane tension are two key factors
   controlling cellular uptake of NPs, both of which are modulated by
   substrate stiffness. Our experimental and modeling results not only open
   up new avenues for engineering NP-based cancer cell targets for more
   effective in vivo delivery but also contribute an example of how the
   physical environment dictates cellular behavior and function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes intensity dependent dispersion of acoustic and
   electromagnetic waves in nonlinear one-dimensional (1D) periodic media.
   Media considered include layered 1D crystals characterized by
   constitutive laws with cubic strain nonlinearities (phononic), and by
   cubic time-dependent Kerr nonlinearities (photonic). A recently
   presented perturbation approach is generalized such that it can be
   successfully applied to the analysis of wave propagation in weakly
   nonlinear elastic and electromagnetic systems. In both, the analysis
   predicts amplitude-dependent dispersion leading to tunable bandgaps.
   These predictions are compared with those obtained from a simplified
   analysis conducted by linearizing the governing equations about an
   assigned field intensity followed by application of the transfer matrix
   method, as is commonly done in nonlinear photonic crystal studies.
   Comparison of the two methods generally shows good dispersion agreement;
   however, in phononic systems the transfer matrix analysis does not
   accurately capture high-strain behavior that occurs for some
   configurations, such as those with thin nonlinear layers, and may even
   predict erroneous bandgaps. Numerical predictions resulting from a
   finite-element analysis of the nonlinear media confirm the improved
   accuracy of the perturbation approach, suggesting its continued use for
   predicting intensity-dependent dispersion in 2D and 3D nonlinear
   phononic and photonic crystals. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{While adaptive control has been used in numerous applications to achieve
   system performance without excessive reliance on dynamical system
   models, the necessity of high-gain learning rates to achieve fast
   adaptation can be a serious limitation of adaptive controllers. This is
   due to the fact that fast adaptation using high-gain learning rates can
   cause high-frequency oscillations in the control response resulting in
   system instability. In this note, we present a new adaptive control
   architecture for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems to address the
   problem of achieving fast adaptation using high-gain learning rates. The
   proposed framework involves a new and novel controller architecture
   involving a modification term in the update law. Specifically, this
   modification term filters out the high-frequency content contained in
   the update law while preserving asymptotic stability of the system error
   dynamics. This key feature of our framework allows for robust, fast
   adaptation in the face of high-gain learning rates. Furthermore, we show
   that transient and steady-state system performance is guaranteed with
   the proposed architecture. Two illustrative numerical examples are
   provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Clutter regarded as ultrasound Doppler echoes of soft tissue interferes
   with the primary objective of color flow imaging (CFI): measurement and
   display of blood flow. Multi-ensemble samples based clutter filters
   degrade resolution or frame rate of CFI. The prevalent single-ensemble
   clutter rejection filter is based on a single rejection criterion and
   fails to achieve a high accuracy for estimating both the low- and
   high-velocity blood flow components.
   The Bilinear Hankel-SVD achieved more exact signal decomposition than
   the conventional Hankel-SVD. Furthermore, the correlation between two
   arbitrary eigen-components obtained by the B-Hankel-SVD was
   demonstrated. In the hybrid approach, the input ultrasound Doppler
   signal first passes through a low-order regression filter, and then the
   output is properly decomposed into a collection of eigen-components
   under the framework of B-Hankel-SVD. The blood flow components are
   finally extracted based on a frequency threshold.
   In a series of simulations, the proposed B-Hankel-SVD filter reduced the
   estimation bias of the blood flow over the conventional Hankel-SVD
   filter. The hybrid algorithm was shown to be more effective than
   regression or Hankel-SVD filters alone in rejecting the undesirable
   clutter components with single-ensemble (S-E) samples. It achieved a
   significant improvement in blood flow frequency estimation and
   estimation variance over the other competing filters.}},

Abstract = {{Image restoration problems, such as image denoising, are important steps
   in various image processing method, such as image segmentation and
   object recognition. Due to the edge preserving property of the convex
   total variation (TV), variational model with TV is commonly used in
   image restoration. However, staircase artifacts are frequently observed
   in restored smoothed region. To remove the staircase artifacts in
   smoothed region, convex higher-order TV (HOTV) regularization methods
   are introduced. But the valuable edge information of the image is also
   attenuated. In this paper, we propose non-convex hybrid TV
   regularization method to significantly reduce staircase artifacts while
   well preserving the valuable edge information of the image. To
   efficiently find a solution of the variation model with the proposed
   regularizer, we use the iterative reweighted method with the augmented
   Lagrangian based algorithm. The proposed model shows the best
   performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the
   structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with comparable computational
   complexity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) shape of a nanostructure by
   conventional imaging techniques in scanning electron microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy can be limited or complicated by
   various factors, such as two-dimensional (2D) projection, diffraction
   contrast and unsure orientation of the nanostructure with respect to the
   electron beam direction. In this paper, in conjunction with electron
   diffraction and imaging, the 3D morphologies of ZnO nanowires and
   nanobelts synthesized via vapor deposition were reconstructed by
   electron tomography in a scanning transmission electron microscope
   (STEM). The cross-sections of these one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures
   include triangle, hexagonal, and rectangle shapes. By combining the
   reconstructed shape with the crystalline information supplied by
   electron diffraction patterns recorded from the same nanowire/nanobelt,
   the growth direction and its exposed surfaces were uniquely identified.
   In total, three different growth directions were confirmed. These
   directions are aOE (c) 0001 >, aOE (c) 2 0 > and aOE (c) 2 3 >
   corresponding to aOE (c) 001 >, aOE (c) 100 > and aOE (c) 101 >
   orientations in three-index notation. The aOE (c) 0001 > growth
   nanowires show triangle or hexagonal cross-sections, with exposed
   \{010\} side surfaces. The dominant surfaces of the aOE (c) 2 0 > growth
   nanobelt are +/-(0001) planes. Both hexagonal and rectangle
   cross-sections were observed in the aOE (c) 2 3 > growth ZnO
   nanostructures. Their surfaces include the \{010\}, \{101\} and \{112\}
   planes. The nanobelts with a large aspect ratio of similar to 10
   normally grow along the aOE (c) 2 0 > direction, while nanobelts with
   small aspect ratio grow along aOE (c) 2 3 > growth direction. The
   approach and methodology demonstrated here can be extended to any
   nanostructures that can be crystalline, polycrystalline or even

Abstract = {{Here we describe a protocol for the fabrication and use of a
   microfluidic device to rapidly orient >700 Drosophila embryos in
   parallel for end-on imaging. The protocol describes master
   microfabrication (similar to 1 d), polydimethylsiloxane molding (few
   hours), system setup and device operation (few minutes) and imaging
   (depending on application). Our microfluidics-based approach described
   here is one of the first to facilitate rapid orientation for end-on
   imaging, and it is a major breakthrough for quantitative studies on

   based on passive hydrodynamics, and it does not require direct
   manipulation of embryos by the user; biologists following the protocol
   should be able to repeat these procedures. The compact design and
   fabrication materials used allow the device to be used with traditional
   microscopy setups and do not require specialized fixtures. Furthermore,
   with slight modification, this array can be applied to the handling of
   other model organisms and oblong objects.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures
   early in development. Mice are commonly used to study the mechanisms
   driving both normal and pathologic cranial suture development. Despite
   their frequency of use as a model, the time course of bone formation and
   mineralization during fusion of mouse posterior frontal suture is not
   well defined.
   Methods: To address this, C57Bl/6J mice were euthanized at ages ranging
   from 6 to 107 days, and the posterior frontal sutures were imaged using
   microcomputed tomography. Scans were analyzed with an image-processing
   algorithm that was previously validated with serial histology to
   quantify both suture fusion and mineral content. The expression profile
   of genes associated with key developmental time points was examined
   using real-time polymerase chain reaction in both the bone and the dura.
   Results: Results demonstrate that the bones of the posterior frontal
   suture come together during days 10 to 20 and then increase in mineral
   content and volume between days 21 and 45. The onset of posterior
   frontal suture fusion was associated with an increase in
   cartilage-associated genes on day 12. Later mineralization of the suture
   was associated with an increase in mRNAs for osteoblast differentiation
   markers, bone morphogenetic proteins, and bone morphogenetic protein
   inhibitors.
   Conclusions: Complete analysis fusion posterior frontal suture shows
   that it occurs in a discontinuous biphasic manner. The first phase is
   from days 10 to 20 and involves production of cartilage. A second
   mineralization phase from days 21 to 45 was seen with both the imaging
   algorithm and changes in gene expression. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 131:

Abstract = {{This paper presents a chemical microsystem based on the integration of a
   silicon-based resonant microsensor and a CMOS ASIC for portable sensing
   applications in air. Two types of resonant microstructures are used as
   mass-sensitive microsensors: cantilever-based and disk-shape
   microresonators. Based on the characteristics of the microsensors,
   CMOS-integrated interface and control electronics have been designed and
   implemented. The CMOS ASIC utilizes the self-oscillation method in which
   a main feedback loop starts and sustains oscillation at or close to the
   desired resonance frequency of the microresonators. For stable
   oscillation, an automatic gain control loop regulates the oscillation
   amplitude by controlling the gain of the main feedback loop. In
   addition, an automatic phase control loop has been included to adjust
   the phase of the main feedback loop to ensure an operating point as
   close as possible to the resonance frequency, which results in improved
   frequency stability. To improve the long-term stability, a method to
   compensate for frequency drift has been proposed and implemented on the
   CMOS chip. The performance of the implemented microsystem as a chemical
   sensor has been evaluated experimentally by detecting different
   concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as benzene, toluene
   and m-xylene with microresonators coated with chemically sensitive
   polymer films. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The roles of titanium surface micro/nanotopography and wettability on
   the differential response of human osteoblast lineage cells}},

Abstract = {{Surface micro- and nanostructural modifications of dental and orthopedic
   implants have shown promising in vitro, in vivo and clinical results.
   Surface wettability has also been suggested to play an important role in
   osteoblast differentiation and osseointegration. However, the available
   techniques to measure surface wettability are not reliable on clinically
   relevant, rough surfaces. Furthermore, how the differentiation state of
   osteoblast lineage cells impacts their response to micro/nanostructured
   surfaces, and the role of wettability on this response, remain unclear.
   In the current study, surface wettability analyses (optical sessile drop
   analysis, environmental scanning electron microscopic analysis and the
   Wilhelmy technique) indicated hydrophobic static responses for deposited
   water droplets on microrough and micro/nanostructured specimens, while
   hydrophilic responses were observed with dynamic analyses of
   micro/nanostructured specimens. The maturation and local factor
   production of human immature osteoblast-like MG63 cells was
   synergistically influenced by nanostructures superimposed onto
   microrough titanium (Ti) surfaces. In contrast, human mesenchymal stem
   cells cultured on micro/nanostructured surfaces in the absence of
   exogenous soluble factors exhibited less robust osteoblastic
   differentiation and local factor production compared to cultures on
   unmodified microroughened Ti. Our results support previous observations
   using Ti6Al4V surfaces showing that recognition of surface
   nanostructures and subsequent cell response is dependent on the
   differentiation state of osteoblast lineage cells. The results also
   indicate that this effect may be partly modulated by surface
   wettability. These findings support the conclusion that the successful
   osseointegration of an implant depends on contributions from osteoblast
   lineage cells at different stages of osteoblast commitment. (C) 2012

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{885-892}},

Abstract = {{Closed-form algebraic expressions for the energy-release rate and the
   mode mixity are obtained for a debonded sandwich (trimaterial). The most
   general case of an ``asymmetric{''} sandwich is considered (i.e., the
   bottom face sheet not necessarily of the same material or thickness as
   the top face sheet). The energy-release rate is obtained by use of the
   J-integral, and the expression is derived in terms of the forces and
   moments at the debond section. Regarding the mode mixity, a closed-form
   expression is derived in terms of the geometry, material, and applied
   loading, and it is proven that, in the trimaterial case, just as in the
   bimaterial case, the mode mixity can be obtained in terms of a single
   scalar quantity omega, which is independent of loading; the w value for
   a particular geometry and material can be extracted from a numerical
   solution for one loading combination. Thus, this analysis extends the
   existing formulas in the literature, which are for either a delamination
   in a homogeneous composite or an interface crack in a bimaterial. These
   new ``trimaterial with a crack{''} formulas are also proven to yield the
   formulas for the limits of a bimaterial or for a homogeneous section
   with a crack.}},

Abstract = {{The extension of the surrogate-based recurrence framework approach to
   account for time-varying swept flow effects under dynamic stall
   conditions is described. Using full-order solutions generated by the
   OVERFLOW computational fluid dynamics code, the surrogate-based
   recurrence framework reduced-order modeling approach is shown to
   effectively mimic full-order solutions of unsteady lift, moment, and
   drag under dynamic stall conditions while maintaining the computational
   efficiency associated with semiempirical dynamic stall models. This
   level of functionality represents a new capability for rotary-wing
   aeroelasticity applications. Furthermore, a generalized kriging
   formulation based on nonstationary Gaussian process modeling is
   implemented in a tractable manner by locally optimizing the
   high-dimensional likelihood function in the vicinity of the stationary
   solution. The resulting nonstationary covariance structures are shown to
   significantly improve the accuracy of the surrogate-based recurrence
   framework predicted moment stall characteristics compared to a
   stationary model. It is shown that the nonstationary surrogate-based
   recurrence framework approach is better able to adapt to abrupt changes
   in airload behavior caused by the underlying dynamic stall vortex
   dynamics. The results indicate that the surrogate-based recurrence
   framework approach based on nonstationary Gaussian process models is a
   promising alternative to widely used semiempirical rotorcraft dynamic
   stall models that cannot account for the effects of time-varying
   velocity components associated with forward flight.}},

Abstract = {{HIV patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) exhibit
   elevated incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including a higher
   risk of myocardial infarction and prevalence of atherosclerotic lesions,
   as well as increases in markers of subclinical atherosclerosis including
   increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (c-IMT), increased
   arterial stiffness, and impaired flow-mediated dilation. Both HAART and
   HIV-infection are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis and
   myocardial infarction. Studies implicate the HIV proteins tat, gp120,
   vpu, and nef in early on-set atherosclerosis. The objective of this
   study was to quantify the role of expression of HIV-1 proteins on the
   vascular function, biomechanics, and geometry of common carotid arteries
   and aortas. This study employed NL4-3 Delta gag/pol transgenic mice
   (HIV-Tg), which contain the genetic sequence for the HIV-1 proteins env,
   tat, nef, rev, vif, vpr, and vpu but lacks the gag and pol genes and
   reports that HIV-Tg mice have impaired aortic endothelial function,
   increased c-IMT, and increased arterial stiffness. Further, HIV-Tg
   arteries show decreased elastin content, increased cathepsin K and
   cathepsin S activity, and increased mechanical residual stress. Thus,
   mice that express HIV proteins exhibit pre-clinical markers of
   atherosclerosis and these markers correlate with changes in markers of
   vascular remodeling. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis
   that HIV-proteins, independent of HAART treatment or HIV infection,
   could play a role in of the development of CVD.}},

Abstract = {{Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) results in increased right
   ventricle (RV) afterload leading to RV remodeling, tricuspid
   regurgitation (TR), and RV failure. Though characterizing the mechanisms
   of TR in PAH may suggest new treatment strategies, the mechanisms
   leading to TR in PAH have not been characterized. In the present study,
   eleven porcine tricuspid valves were studied in an in vitro right heart
   simulator. Annular dilatations of 1.2 and 1.4 times normal area,
   papillary muscle (PM) displacement simulating concentric RV dilatation
   and eccentric RV dilatation due to concomitant left ventricle
   dysfunction, and two levels of PAH hemodynamics were simulated
   independently and in combination. Relative TR, tenting area (TA) along
   each coaptation line, and coaptation area (CA) of each leaflet were
   quantified. Results showed a significant increase (p a parts per
   thousand currency sign 0.05) in TR with both increased mean pulmonary
   artery pressure (mPAP) and annular dilatation of 1.4 times normal.
   Increased mPAP significantly decreased TA but tended to increase CA,
   while PM displacement significantly increased TA but did not affect CA,
   suggesting competing effects of transvalvular pressure and leaflet
   tethering. Annular dilatation significantly decreased anterior and
   posterior CA but did not affect TA. These results may inform future TV
   repairs in PAH to reduce TR and improve RV hemodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymers, either as porous scaffolds or microspheres, have
   been investigated broadly for cartilage tissue engineering. A
   combination of these two forms of materials could potentially maximize
   their benefits. In this study, porous poly
   (L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (PLCL) scaffolds were integrated
   with poly (beta-hydroxybutyrate-co-beta-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)
   microspheres to enhance the mechanical properties of the scaffolds as
   well as to potentially regulate cell behavior through altering surface
   topography. PHBV microspheres fabricated with an emulsion solvent
   evaporation method were incorporated into PLCL scaffolds (0\%, 20\%,
   40\% and 50\% W/W). Compressive modulus, surface topography and porosity
   of the composite scaffolds were evaluated, and in vitro and in vivo
   chondrogenesis within the chondrocyte-laden scaffolds was investigated
   by examining proliferation of chondrocytes and the deposition of
   glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and type II collagen. The results showed
   significant enhancement of the compressive modulus of the scaffolds
   incorporated with PHBV microspheres, while Young's modulus of the
   scaffolds with 50\% PHBV incorporation was 3.3 times higher than PLCL
   scaffolds alone. The porosity of the composite scaffolds was kept
   constant for all levels of PHBV incorporation. Though the PLCL scaffolds
   incorporated with microspheres showed no significant effects on adhesion
   at 6 h as well as in vitro cartilage formation and proliferation of the
   chondrocytes at both 2 weeks and 4 weeks, total contents of GAG and type
   II collagen excreted increased significantly with time. The
   chondrocyte-laden scaffolds formed cartilage-like tissues at 4 and 8
   weeks after implantation in nude mice, with increased staining density
   of type II collagen and GAG over time. In conclusion, incorporation of
   PHBV microspheres not only enhanced the compressive}},

Abstract = {{Recently there has been an increased interest in the effects of
   paracrine signaling between groups of cells, particularly in the context
   of better understanding how stem cells contribute to tissue repair. Most
   current 3D co-culture methods lack the ability to effectively separate
   two cell populations after the culture period, which is important for
   simultaneously analyzing the reciprocal effects of each cell type on the
   other. Here, we detail the development of a 3D hydrogel co-culture
   system that allows us to culture different cell types for up to 7 days
   and subsequently separate and isolate the different cell populations
   using enzyme-sensitive glues. Separable 3D co-culture laminates were
   prepared by laminating PEG-based hydrogels with enzyme-degradable
   hydrogel adhesives. Encapsulated cell populations exhibited good
   segregation with well-defined interfaces. Furthermore, constructs can be
   separated on-demand upon addition of the appropriate enzyme, while cell
   viability remains high throughout the culture period, even after
   laminate separation. This platform offers great potential for a variety
   of basic cell signaling studies as the incorporation of an
   enzyme-sensitive adhesive interface allows the on-demand separation of
   individual cell populations for immediate analysis or further culture to
   examine persistence of co-culture effects and paracrine signaling on
   cell populations. See accompanying commentary by Danielle R. Bogdanowicz

Abstract = {{Single-crystal gold nanospheres with controlled diameters in the range
   530nm were synthesized by using a facile approach that was based on
   successive seed-mediated growth. The key to the success of this
   synthesis was the use of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as a
   capping agent and a large excess of ascorbic acid as a reductant to
   ensure fast reduction and, thus, single crystallinity and a spherical
   shape of the resultant nanoparticles. The diameters of the gold
   nanospheres could be readily controlled by varying the amount of seeds
   that were introduced into the reaction system. The gold nanospheres
   could be produced with uniform diameters of up to 30nm; thus, their
   localized surface plasmon resonance properties could be directly
   compared with the results that were obtained from theoretical
   calculations. Interestingly, we also found that these gold nanospheres
   self-assembled into dimers, larger aggregates, and wavy nanowires when
   they were collected by centrifugation, dispersed in deionized water, and
   then diluted to different volumes with deionized water.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, flexibility of nano plastic forming and etching, an
   ultra-high resolution nanofabrication process developed recently by the
   authors, in terms of fabrication of arbitrary patterns as well as
   applicability to various work materials is demonstrated. First, a thin
   layer of nickel (Ni) is deposited on a silicon (Si) substrate. Then, it
   is directly patterned by nano plastic forming. Next, the patterned Ni
   mask is slightly etched by direct current sputter etching to transfer
   the pattern into the entire mask thickness and expose the surface of the
   substrate in the individual patterned areas. Afterward, the pattern is
   transferred onto the substrate by reactive ion etching. Finally, the
   remained Ni layer is removed from the substrate, and nanostructures
   fabricated on the surface of the substrate are revealed. Fabrication of
   grid patterns with various pitch settings on the surface of Si
   substrates is demonstrated. The experimental results indicate that the
   depth and width of the nanostructures can be controlled by the etching
   time. Also, it is confirmed from the results that the depth and width
   are not influenced by the pitch setting.}},

Abstract = {{Epitaxial graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on SiC have shown
   big potential in electronics. The motivation to produce faster and
   smaller electronic devices using less power opened the way to a study of
   how to produce controlled epitaxial graphene and CNTs on SiC. Since
   defects are among the important tools to control the properties of
   materials, the effects of defects on the carbon formation on SiC have
   been analyzed. In this study, the effects of defects on the carbon
   formation on SiC have been analyzed. We produced carbon films on the
   surface of four different SiC materials (polycrystalline sintered SiC
   disks, single crystalline SiC wafers, SiC whiskers, and nanowhiskers) by
   chlorination and vacuum annealing with the goal to understand the
   effects of surface defects on the carbon structure and the SiC
   decomposition rate. We have shown that grain boundaries, dislocations,
   scratches, surface steps, and external surfaces may greatly enhance the
   reaction rate and affect the final structure of carbon derived from SiC.}},

Abstract = {{We report the mechanical behavior of vertically aligned carbon nanotube
   films, grown on Si substrates using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor
   deposition, subjected to in situ large displacement (up to 70 mu m)
   flat-punch indentations. We observed three distinct regimes in their
   indentation stress-strain curves: (i) a short elastic regime, followed
   by (ii) a sudden instability, which resulted in a substantial rapid
   displacement burst manifested by an instantaneous vertical shearing of
   the material directly underneath the indenter tip by as much as 30 mu m,
   and (iii) a positively sloped plateau for displacements between 10 and
   70 mu m. In situ nanomechanical indentation experiments revealed that
   the shear strain was accommodated by an array of coiled carbon nanotube
   ``microrollers,{''} providing a low-friction path for the vertical
   displacement. Mechanical response and concurrent deformation
   morphologies are discussed in the foam-like deformation framework with a
   particular emphasis on boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider totally unimodular (TU) stochastic programs, that is,
   two-stage stochastic programs whose extensive-form constraint matrix is
   TU. We generalize the notion of total unimodularity to apply to sets of
   matrices and provide properties of such sets. We provide several
   sufficient conditions on stochastic programs to be TU. When solving TU
   stochastic problems using the L-shaped method, it is not clear whether
   the integrality restrictions should be imposed on the master problem.
   Such restrictions will make each master problem more difficult to solve.
   On the other hand, solving the linear relaxation of the master typically
   means sending fractional (and unlikely optimal) solutions to the
   subproblems, perhaps leading to more iterations. Our computational
   results investigate this trade-off and provide insight into which
   strategy is preferable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a special but broad class of convex programming
   problems whose feasible region is a simple compact convex set
   intersected with the inverse image of a closed convex cone under an
   affine transformation. It studies the computational complexity of
   quadratic penalty based methods for solving the above class of problems.
   An iteration of these methods, which is simply an iteration of
   Nesterov's optimal method (or one of its variants) for approximately
   solving a smooth penalization subproblem, consists of one or two
   projections onto the simple convex set. Iteration-complexity bounds
   expressed in terms of the latter type of iterations are derived for two
   quadratic penalty based variants, namely: one which applies the
   quadratic penalty method directly to the original problem and another
   one which applies the latter method to a perturbation of the original
   problem obtained by adding a small quadratic term to its objective
   function.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Gomory (Linear Algebra Appl 2:451-558, 1969) gave a subadditive
   characterization of the facets of the group polyhedron. Although there
   are exponentially many facets (see Gomory and Johnson in Math Program
   3:359-389, 1972, Example 4.6) and exponentially many vertices for the
   group polyhedron for the master cyclic group problem, Gomory's
   characterization of the non-trivial facets has polynomially many
   subadditive inequalities, in fact of order |G|(2) for a finite Abelian
   group G. We reduce this subadditive inequality system to its minimal
   representation by a triple system of the same order and show the
   dimensionality of the polytope of non-trivial facets. The system of all
   triples corresponds to all solution vectors of length three into which
   every solution vector can be decomposed. Our minimal representation
   leads to a characterization of the vertices of length three. Gomory et
   al. (Math Program 96:321-339, 2003) introduced a shooting experiment
   involving solving the shooting linear program repeatedly to find
   important facets. We develop a topological network flow model of the
   dual problem of the shooting linear program in a reverse procedure from
   the decomposition of solution vectors into triples. Hunsaker (2003) gave
   a knapsack shooting experiment, which we use to find a simple pattern
   for the most hit knapsack facets.}},

   provide to support the development of a specific kind of
   plug-insplug-ins that implement program analysis and software testing
   techniques. To guide the discussion, we first provide a survey of
   existing testing and analysis plug-ins and, for each of these plug-ins,
   discuss the details of the IDE support they use. We then present a case
   study based on our personal experience with building a
   regression-testing plug-in for two different IDEs. Finally, we use our
   findings to make a generalized discussion on the kind of capabilities a

Title = {{A Film Thickness Correction Formula for Double-Newtonian Shear-Thinning

Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Lubricants which contain a polymeric thickener will often display a
   second Newtonian plateau in measured flow curves. Like other
   manifestations of shear-dependent viscosity, this shear response will
   lead to an inaccurate prediction when the classical film-thickness
   formulas are employed. A correction formula has been developed from
   numerical experiments for a range of parameters of the double-Newtonian
   modified Carreau equation. The parameters of this shear-thinning model
   were selected from measurements for real lubricants obtained in Couette
   viscometers and a capillary viscometer. In addition, a full EHL film
   thickness formula has been derived from the same numerical experiments.
   The correction formula and the full formula were successfully validated
   using published film thickness data and published viscosity data for an
   EHL reference liquid, a polymer solution. Clearly, viscometer
   measurements of shear-dependent viscosity which contain the inflection
   leading to the second Newtonian are essential for a film-thickness
   calculation when a high-molecular-weight component of the lubricant is
   present.}},

Title = {{Increasing Rate of Detection of Wrong-Patient Radiographs: Use of
   Photographs Obtained at Time of Radiography}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{200}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate whether facial and
   chest photographs obtained simultaneously with radiographs increase
   radiologists' detection rate of labeling errors.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. We obtained simultaneous portable radiographs and
   photographs of 34 patients. We generated 88 pairs of chest radiographs
   (one recent radiograph, one prior radiograph) and compiled a set of 20
   pairs for reader review. Two, three, or four mismatched pairs (i.e.,
   pairs containing radiographs of different patients) were introduced into
   each list. Ten radiologist readers blinded to the presence of mismatches
   interpreted the 20 radiograph pairs. Readers then reviewed a second set
   of 20 pairs containing mismatches but photographs of the patients
   obtained at the time of imaging were attached to the radiographs.
   Readers were not instructed regarding the purpose of the photographs.
   The mismatch detection rate and time for interpretation was recorded for
   both sessions. The two-tailed Fisher exact test was used to evaluate
   differences in mismatch detection rates between sessions, with a p value
   of less than 0.05 being considered significant.
   RESULTS. The error detection rates without (3/24 = 12.5\%) and with
   (16/25 = 64\%) photographs significantly differed (p = 0.0003). The
   average interpretation times without and with photographs were 35.73 and
   26.51 minutes, respectively (two-tailed Student t test, p = 0.1165).
   CONCLUSION. The use of photographs increased the detection of errors
   without a concomitant increase in film interpretation time, which may
   translate into improvements in patient safety without an increase in
   interpretation time.}},

Abstract = {{Polaromonas sp. strain JS666 grows on cis-1,2-dichoroethene (cDCE) as
   the sole carbon and energy source under aerobic conditions, but the
   degradation mechanism and the enzymes involved are unknown. In this
   study, we established the complete pathway for cDCE degradation through
   heterologous gene expression, inhibition studies, enzyme assays, and
   analysis of intermediates. Several lines of evidence indicate that a
   cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzes the initial step of cDCE
   degradation. Both the transient accumulation of dichloroacetaldehyde in
   cDCE-degrading cultures and dichloroacetaldehyde dehydrogenase
   activities in cell extracts of JS666 support a pathway for degradation
   of cDCE through dichloroacetaldehyde. The mechanism minimizes the
   formation of cDCE epoxide. The molecular phylogeny of the cytochrome
   P450 gene and the organization of neighboring genes suggest that the
   cDCE degradation pathway recently evolved in a progenitor capable of
   degrading 1,2-dichloroethane either by the recruitment of the cytochrome
   P450 monooxygenase gene from an alkane catabolic pathway or by selection
   for variants of the P450 in a preexisting 1,2-dichloroethane catabolic
   pathway. The results presented here add yet another role to the broad
   array of productive reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Limitations with standard intradermal injections have created a clinical
   need for an alternative, low-cost injection device. In this study, we
   designed a hollow metal microneedle for reliable intradermal injection
   and developed a high-throughput micromolding process to produce metal
   microneedles with complex geometries. To fabricate the microneedles, we
   laser-ablated a 70 mu m x 70 mu m square cavity near the tip of
   poly(lactic acid) (PLA) microneedles. The master structure was a
   template for multiple micromolded poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)
   (PLGA) replicas. Each replica was sputtered with a gold seed layer with
   minimal gold deposited in the cavity due to masking effects. In this
   way, nickel was electrodeposited selectively outside of the cavity,
   after which the polymer replica was dissolved to produce a hollow metal
   microneedle. Force-displacement tests showed the microneedles, with 12
   mu m thick electrodeposition, could penetrate skin with an insertion
   force 9 times less than their axial failure force. We injected fluid
   with the microneedles into pig skin in vitro and hairless guinea pig
   skin in vivo. The injections targeted 90 \% of the material within the
   skin with minimal leakage onto the skin surface. We conclude that hollow
   microneedles made by this simple microfabrication method can achieve
   targeted intradermal injection.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitive identification of the etiology of viral diseases is key to
   implementing appropriate prevention and treatment. The gold standard for
   virus identification is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique
   that allows for highly specific and sensitive detection of pathogens by
   exponentially amplifying a specific region of DNA from as little as a
   single copy through thermocycling a biochemical cocktail. Today,
   molecular biology laboratories use commercial instruments that operate
   in 0.5-2 h/analysis using reaction volumes of 5-50 mu L contained within
   polymer tubes or chambers. Towards reducing this volume and maintaining
   performance, we present a semi-quantitative, systematic experimental
   study of how PCR yield is affected by tube/chamber substrate,
   surface-area-to-volume ratio (SA:V), and passivation methods. We perform
   PCR experiments using traditional PCR tubes as well as using disposable
   polymer microchips with 1 mu L reaction volumes thermocycled using water
   baths. We report the first oil encapsulation microfluidic PCR method
   without fluid flow and its application to the first microfluidic
   amplification of Epstein Barr virus using consensus degenerate primers,
   a powerful and broad PCR method to screen for both known and novel
   members of a viral family. The limit of detection is measured as 140
   starting copies of DNA from a starting concentration of 3 x 10(5)
   copies/mL, regarded as an accepted sensitivity threshold for diagnostic
   purposes, and reaction specificity was improved as compared to
   conventional methods. Also notable, these experiments were conducted
   with conventional reagent concentrations, rather than commonly spiked
   enzyme and/or template mixtures. This experimental study of the effects
   of substrate, SA:V, and passivation, together with sensitive and
   specific microfluidic PCR with consensus degenerate primers represent
   advances towards lower cost and higher throughput pathogen screening.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop an analytical model of the execution
   efficiency of transactional memory (TM) systems. This model employs
   queuing theory to analyze the impact of an essential set of TM design
   parameters including the conflict rate, number of conflict
   detection/resolution points, and implementation overhead. The model is
   validated via extensive experiments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the model, we further study the performance impact of two factors. Our
   study shows that, for a given TM-based program, the frequency of
   performing conflict detection can be carefully chosen to minimize the
   mean transaction completion time. Our study also demonstrated the
   importance of reducing implementation overhead. We expect our study to
   be useful for designing TM systems and applications. Copyright (c) 2012

   applied to the spring, the nanogenerator produced a stable AC output
   voltage and current, which are linearly responding to the applied weight
   on the spring. By conjunction of the experimental data with finite
   element simulation, we show that the output open-circuit voltage of the
   nanogenerator can serve as an active sensor for a self-powered weight
   measurement system. By active sensor we mean that the sensor
   automatically gives an electric output signal without applying an
   external power source, which can be used to directly quantify the

Abstract = {{Water-soluble (K)7{[}(CoCoII)-Co-III(H2O)W11O39] (1) was tested as the
   first cobalt-containing Keggin polyoxometalate catalyst for efficient
   O-2 production via both visible-light driven and thermal water
   oxidation. Under the optimal photocatalytic conditions
   {[}photoirradiation at lambda >= 420 nm, {[}Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 as the
   photosensor, Na2S2O8 as the oxidant in borate buffer (pH = 9.0)], the
   turnover number (TON) can reach as high as 360, the initial quantum
   yield and the initial turnover frequency (TOF) for the first 60 seconds
   was 27\% and 0.5 s(-1), respectively. Variables of the photocatalytic
   reaction, including catalyst concentrations, buffer types and
   concentrations, pHs, dye concentrations, oxidant concentrations, etc.,
   were systemically studied. The oxygen atoms of the evolved oxygen came
   from water, as confirmed by isotope-labeled experiments. In the thermal
   water oxidation, the TON and oxygen yield were measured to be 15 and
   60\%, respectively. The stability of 1 was tested and confirmed with
   multiple experiments (laser flash photolysis, DLS, CV, FT-IR, EDX, and
   catalyst recycling) within the photocatalytic water oxidation duration,
   which ruled out the possibility that neither the free Co2+ ions were
   present in the reaction solution nor were cobalt oxide/hydroxide
   nanoparticles in situ formed from the assumed decomposition of 1. All
   the evidence stated here collectively supports that 1 is the true
   molecular catalyst. In addition, the recycled sample was reused for
   water oxidation catalysis and showed similar catalytic behaviors
   (kinetics and activity) to that of the freshly prepared catalyst. No
   insoluble forms where found when the borate buffer solution of 1 was
   aged for 2 months, whereas its analogue,
   K-8{[}(CoCoII)-Co-II(H2O)W11O39] (4), is rapidly decomposed to a
   blue-purple cobalt oxide precipitate in borate buffer. The stability
   difference between 1 and 4 indicates that the +3 oxidation state of the
   central cobalt in 1 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural
   integrity. A series of other Keggin-type POMs, such as
   K-6{[}(CoW12O40)-W-II] (2), K-5{[}(CoW12O40)-W-III] (3),
   K-6{[}SiCoII(H2O)W11O39] (5), and K-5{[}PCoII(H2O)W11O39] (6), were also
   evaluated for their catalytic activity by comparison with 1. Our study
   demonstrates that the unique structural features of the mixed-valent
   central and peripheral cobalt atoms are essential for 1 to maintain both
   catalytic stability and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Cu2O/TiO2 p-n heterojunction photoelectrodes were prepared by depositing
   different amounts of p-type Cu2O nanoparticles on n-type TiO2 nanotube
   arrays (i.e., forming Cu2O/TiO2 composite nanotubes) via an
   ultrasonication-assisted sequential chemical bath deposition. The
   success of deposition of Cu2O nanoparticles was corroborated by
   structural and composition characterizations. The enhanced absorption in
   the visible light region was observed in Cu2O/TiO2 composite nanotubes.
   The largely improved separation of photogenerated electrons and holes
   was revealed by photocurrent measurements. Consequently, Cu2O/TiO2
   heterojunction photoelectrodes exhibited a more effective
   photoconversion capability than TiO2 nanotubes alone in
   photoelectrochemical measurements. Furthermore, Cu2O/TiO2 composite
   photoelectrodes also possessed superior photoelectrocatalytic activity
   and stability in the degradation of Rhodamine B. Intriguingly, by
   selecting an appropriate bias potential, a synergistic effect between
   electricity and visible light irradiation can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation plays an important role in the outcome of motor learning but

   two different motivational conditions and gender on performance during a
   complex tongue-training paradigm using the Tongue Drive System (TDS). In
   addition, subject-based reports of motivation, fun, pain, and fatigue
   were compared between groups and genders. Sixteen subjects were
   randomized into three groups and were asked to use the TDS for 40min. A
   motivational condition (monetary reward or self-controlled practice) was
   introduced in two groups and the third group served as the control. The
   subjects were instructed to play a computer game using the TDS, having
   control of the computer cursor through a magnet attached to the tongue,
   and performance was compared among groups. Performance improved in all
   groups and in both genders. The monetary reward group tended towards
   higher performance scores compared with the control group, whereas the
   self-controlled practice group performed significantly better compared
   with the control group. There was no significant difference between
   groups and genders in the subject-based report for level of motivation,

Abstract = {{A 6D motion gesture is represented by a 3D spatial trajectory and
   augmented by another three dimensions of orientation. Using different
   tracking technologies, the motion can be tracked explicitly with the
   position and orientation or implicitly with the acceleration and angular
   speed. In this work, we address the problem of motion gesture
   recognition for command-and-control applications. Our main contribution
   is to investigate the relative effectiveness of various feature
   dimensions for motion gesture recognition in both user-dependent and
   user-independent cases. We introduce a statistical feature-based
   classifier as the baseline and propose an HMM-based recognizer, which
   offers more flexibility in feature selection and achieves better
   performance in recognition accuracy than the baseline system. Our motion
   gesture database which contains both explicit and implicit motion
   information allows us to compare the recognition performance of
   different tracking signals on a common ground. This study also gives an
   insight into the attainable recognition rate with different tracking
   devices, which is valuable for the system designer to choose the proper
   tracking technology.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{In wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), visual correlation
   exists among multiple nearby cameras, thus leading to considerable
   redundancy in the collected images. This paper proposes a differential
   coding-based scheduling framework for efficiently gathering visually
   correlated images. This framework consists of two components including
   MinMax Degree Hub Location (MDHL) and Maximum Lifetime Scheduling (MLS).
   The MDHL problem aims to find the optimal locations for the multimedia
   processing hubs, which operate on different channels for concurrently
   collecting images from adjacent cameras, such that the number of
   channels required for frequency reuse is minimized. After associating
   camera sensors with proper hubs, the MLS problem targets at designing a
   schedule for the cameras such that the network lifetime of the cameras
   is maximized by letting highly correlated cameras perform differential
   coding on the fly. It is proven in this paper that the MDHL problem is
   NP-complete, and the MLS problem is NP-hard. Consequently, approximation
   algorithms are proposed to provide bounded performance. Since the
   designed algorithms only take the camera settings as inputs, they are
   independent of specific multimedia applications. Experiments and
   simulations show that the proposed differential coding-based scheduling
   can effectively enhance the network throughput and the energy efficiency
   of camera sensors.}},

Abstract = {{We present the Secure SOurce-BAsed Loose Synchronization (SOBAS)
   protocol to securely synchronize the events in the network, without the
   transmission of explicit synchronization control messages. In SOBAS,
   nodes use their local time values as a one-time dynamic key to encrypt
   each message. In this way, SOBAS provides an effective dynamic en-route
   filtering mechanism, where the malicious data is filtered from the
   network. With SOBAS, we are able to achieve our main goal of
   synchronizing events at the sink as quickly, as accurately, and as
   surreptitiously as possible. With loose synchronization, SOBAS reduces
   the number of control messages needed for a WSN to operate providing the
   key benefits of reduced energy consumption as well as reducing the
   opportunity for malicious nodes to eavesdrop, intercept, or be made
   aware of the presence of the network. Albeit a loose synchronization per
   se, SOBAS is also able to provide 7.24 mu s clock precision given
   today's sensor technology, which is much better than other comparable
   schemes (schemes that do not employ GPS devices). Also, we show that by
   recognizing the need for and employing loose time synchronization,
   necessary synchronization can be provided to the WSN application using
   half of the energy needed for traditional schemes. Both analytical and
   simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility of SOBAS as
   well as the energy consumption of the scheme under normal operation and
   attack from malicious nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Online monitoring of surface roughness is a desirable capability for
   machining processes; however, 100 \% inspection of all parts is not
   feasible unless it can be integrated into the machining process itself
   through real-time monitoring of cutting conditions. One strategy is to
   feed these conditions into a predictive modeling kernel which would in
   turn give the properties of the finished part. In the case of roughness,
   the surface resulting from turning can be largely represented as the
   trace of the passing tool geometry. The question addressed herein is
   whether computationally intensive modeling of the surface accounting for
   tool nose radius is necessary for online monitoring of surface
   roughness. This paper presents a predictive modeling methodology wherein
   the tool-workpiece contact position varies under a simple cutting model,
   and the resulting surface roughness is estimated. It presents the
   concept of calculating a ``pseudo-roughness{''} value based only on tool
   tip locations and to compare this value to that determined by full
   predictive modeling of the tool geometry. Cutting experimental data has
   been presented and compared to predictions for model validation. It is
   found that the root mean square roughness calculation is dominated by
   tool geometry, rather than tool position deviations and surface
   roughness estimation could be implemented without a computationally
   intensive modeling component, thereby enabling online monitoring and
   potentially real-time control of the part finish.}},

Abstract = {{The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry delivers
   increasingly complex projects but struggles to leverage information
   technology to facilitate communication on these projects. To begin to
   address this challenge, the AEC project information management research
   field needs methods to assess communication, complexity, and their
   relationships. First, the authors apply complexity and virtual design
   and construction research to contribute a method for assessing product,
   organization, and process (POP) complexity. Second, through project team
   interviews, the authors contribute a communication assessment method to
   assess collaboration within projects, sharing of information between
   projects, and understanding of information generated across the firm or
   industry. Applying the two assessment methods to case studies, the
   authors validate the applicability of the methods to the AEC industry
   and propose a trend between increased POP complexity and increased
   communication challenges. The two assessment methods provide the
   opportunity for teams to learn from and improve upon their communication
   strategies on the basis of project complexity. By increasing the
   awareness of the relationship between complexity and communication, this
   paper aims to motivate and provide foundation for the development of
   more effective and efficient communication tools. DOI:

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Problem: The prediction of cutting forces is very important in designing
   mechanical micromachining to ensure geometrical accuracy of the machined
   feature and avoid tool breakage. These predictions can be done either
   via analytical models or finite-element models. The finite-element
   models are precise but usually time consuming to run. Analytical models,
   on the other hand, are less accurate but computationally much cheaper.
   The problem here is to integrate these two types of physics-based models
   and obtain an easy-to-evaluate statistical model that can approximate
   the machining forces.
   Approach: We propose performing a sensitivity analysis using the
   computationally cheap analytical models prior to conducting the
   computationally intensive finite-element simulations. With the elicited
   prior knowledge from the sensitivity analysis, a two-stage strategy is
   presented for designing the finite-element simulations in which
   customized number of levels can be assigned for each input factor. The
   finite-element simulation data can then be integrated with the
   analytical models in developing the final metamodel.
   Results: We show that the initial sensitivity analysis can reveal
   critical information about the underlying system and guide us to more
   efficiently extract information from the finite-element models. The
   proposed design for the finite-element simulations is comprised of two
   subarrays and overall can achieve desirable orthogonality and
   space-filling properties. Compared with using n different levels for all
   input factors, as in the traditional space-filling design, the new
   design is more capable for estimating factor interactions while still
   maintaining the ability to capture necessary nonlinear effects. By using
   fewer levels, it can also improve the efficiency of estimating the
   effects when the simulation is subject to stochastic noise. In model
   validation, our numerical results indicate that the fitted integrated
   metamodel can more precisely approximate the machining forces than
   either using the analytical models or the traditional metamodel based on
   the finite-element simulations alone.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing a
   large-scale range panoramic background model that provides fast
   registration of the observed frame and localizes the foreground targets
   with arbitrary camera direction and scale in a Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ)
   camera-based surveillance system. Our method consists of three stages.
   (1) In the first stage, a panoramic Gaussian mixture model (PGMM) of the
   PTZ camera's field of view is generated off-line for later use in
   on-line foreground detection. (2) In the second stage, a multi-layered
   correspondence ensemble is generated off-line from frames captured at
   different scales which is used by the correspondence propagation method
   to register observed frames online to the PGMM. (3) In the third stage,
   foreground is detected and the PGMM is updated. The proposed method has
   the capacity to deal with the PTZ camera's ability to cover a wide field
   of view (FOV) and large-scale range. We demonstrate the advantages of
   the proposed PGMM background subtraction method by incorporating it with
   a tracking system for surveillance applications.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Most methods to increase transdermal drug delivery focus on increasing
   stratum corneum permeability, without addressing the need to increase
   permeability of viable epidermis. Here, we assess the hypothesis that
   viable epidermis offers a significant permeability barrier that becomes
   rate limiting upon sufficient permeabilization of stratum corneum.
   We tested this hypothesis by using calibrated microdermabrasion to
   selectively remove stratum corneum or full epidermis in pig and human
   skin, and then measuring skin permeability to a small molecule
   (sulforhodamine) and macromolecules (bovine serum albumin, insulin,
   inactivated influenza vaccine) in vitro.
   We found that removal of stratum corneum dramatically increased skin
   permeability to all compounds tested. However, removal of full epidermis
   increased skin permeability by another 1-2 orders of magnitude. We also
   studied the effects of removing skin tissue only from localized spots on
   the skin surface by covering skin with a mask containing 125-mu m holes
   during tissue removal. Skin permeabilized in this less-invasive way
   showed similar results. This suggests that microdermabrasion of skin
   using a mask may provide an effective way to increase skin permeability.
   We conclude that viable epidermis offers a significant permeability
   barrier that becomes rate limiting upon removal of stratum corneum.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) fiber and its composites have been
   widely studied recently. However, most physical properties reported in
   literature are measured from a nanofiber web. In this study, for the
   first time, the mechanical properties of individual electrospun fiber,
   rather than fiber web, of cellulose nanowhisker-reinforced poly(vinyl
   alcohol) was studied using nanoindentation technique. The modulus is 2.1
   GPa for a pure PVA electrospun fiber, and 7.6 GPa for 20.0 wt\%
   cellulose nanowhisker-reinforced PVA electrospun fiber, respectively.
   The modulus of PVA/cellulose nanowhisker electrospun fibers increases
   linearly with increasing loading ratio of cellulose nanowhiskers up to
   20.0 wt\%. The experimental results were compared with that calculated
   using isotropic and longitudinal Halpin-Tsai models. The modules of the
   cellulose nanowhiskers are 60-80 \% higher than the isotropic model
   predictions but lower than longitudinal model prediction, suggesting the
   nanowhiskers are partially aligned to the electrospun fiber direction.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant central nervous
   system tumor, and also among the most difficult to treat due to a lack
   of response to chemotherapeutics. New methods of countering the
   mechanisms that confer chemoresistance to malignant gliomas could lead
   to significant advances in the quest to identify novel drug combinations
   or targeted drug delivery systems for cancer therapy. In this study, we
   investigate the use of a targeted nitric oxide (NO) donor as a
   pretreatment to sensitize glioma cells to chemotherapy. The protein
   chlorotoxin (CTX) has been shown to preferentially target glioma cells,
   and we have developed CTXNO, a glioma-specific, NO-donating CTX
   derivative. Pretreatment of cells with CTXNO followed by 48-h exposure
   to either carmustine (BCNU) or temozolomide (TMZ), both common
   chemotherapeutics used in glioma treatment, resulted in increased
   efficacy of both therapeutics. After CTXNO exposure, both T98G and
   U-87MG human malignant glioma cells show increased sensitivity to BCNU
   and TMZ. Further investigation revealed that the consequences of this
   combination therapy was a reduction in active levels of the
   cytoprotective enzyme MGMT and altered p53 activity, both of which are
   essential in DNA repair and tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy. The
   combination of CTXNO and chemotherapeutics also led to decreased cell
   invasion. These studies indicate that this targeted NO donor could be an
   invaluable tool in the development of novel approaches to treat cancer.

Abstract = {{Laboratory mechanical softwood pulps (MSP) and commercial bleached

   grinding with a SuperMassColloider(A (R)). The extent of fibrillation
   was evaluated by SEM imaging, water retention value (WRV) and cellulase
   adsorption. Both lignin content and mechanical treatment significantly
   affected deconstruction and enzymatic saccharification of fibrillated
   MSP and BSKP. Fibrillation of MSP and BSKP cell walls occurs rapidly and
   then levels off; further fibrillation has only limited effect on cell
   wall breakdown as measured by water retention value and cellulase
   adsorption. Complete (100 \%) saccharification can be achieved at
   cellulase loading of 5 FPU/g glucan for BSKP after only 15 min
   fibrillation with energy input of 0.69 MJ/kg. However, the presence of
   lignin in MSP affects the extent of fibrillation producing fibrils
   mainly above 1 mu m. Lignin binds nonproductively to cellulases and
   blocks cellulose thereby reducing its accessibility. As a result, the
   cellulose saccharification efficiency of MSP fibrils (6 h of

Abstract = {{Solution-processable polymers consisting of perylene diimide (PDI)
   acceptor moieties alternating with dithienothiophene (DTT),
   N-dodecyl-dithienopyrrole (DTP), or oligomers of these donor groups have
   been synthesized. We have, in addition to varying the donor, varied the
   N,N substituents of the PDIs. The thermal, optical, electrochemical, and
   charge-transport properties of the polymers have been investigated. The
   polymers show broad absorption extending from 300 to 1000 nm with
   optical band gaps as low as 1.2 eV; the band gap decreases with
   increasing the conjugation length of donor block, or by replacement of
   DTT by DTP. The electron affinities of the polymers, estimated from
   electrochemical data, range from 3.87 to 4.01 eV and are slightly
   affected by the specific choice of donor moiety, while the estimated
   ionization potentials (5.31 to 5.92 eV) are more sensitive to the choice
   of donor. Bottom-gate top-contact organic field-effect transistors based
   on the polymers generally exhibit n-channel behavior with electron
   mobilities as high as 1.7 x 102 cm2/V/s and on/off ratios as high as
   106; one PDI-DTP polymer is an ambipolar transport material with
   electron mobility of 4 x 104 cm2/V/s and hole mobility of 4 x 105
   cm2/V/s in air. There is considerable variation in the charge transport
   properties of the polymers with the chemical structures. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{Diffusion of water and ethanol in silicalite has been studied in large
   crystals (70 mu m x 30 mu m x 15 mu m) synthesized via a fluoride
   mediated route. The near-perfect hydrophobic silicalite (F-) crystals
   have very few internal silanol defects and, as a result, display water
   and ethanol transport behavior that is uncontaminated by these defects.
   The transport diffusivity (D-t) of ethanol is higher than that of water
   at the same sorbate activity. However, this difference is due to the
   difference in the shape of the isotherms. The thermodynamically
   corrected diffusivity (D-o) of water is almost an order of magnitude
   higher than that of ethanol reflecting the difference in molecular size.
   Estimates of the permeability/permselectivity/separation factors for
   ethanol/water separation based on the present kinetic and equilibrium
   data for the fluoride synthesized crystals are compared with the values
   observed for traditional silicalite membranes. The present diffusivity
   values for fluoride synthesized silicalite are similar to the values for
   regular silicalite (OH-) derived from uptake rate measurements but much
   smaller (by more than four orders of magnitude) than the
   self-diffusivities derived from PFG-NMR measurements. This result is
   consistent with the results of other measurements of the diffusion of
   small molecules in silicalite which suggest that, in macroscopic
   measurements, the rate of intra-crystalline transport is controlled by
   the sub-structure (extensive twinning), rather than by diffusion in the
   ideal MFI micropores. In this situation micro-scale measurements such as
   PFG-NMR will lead to erroneously high estimates of transport rates and
   therefore of permeability and permselectivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Ceramic membrane processes are a rapidly emerging technology for water
   treatment, yet virtually no information on the performance and fouling
   mechanisms is available to the industry considering them as an
   alternative to polymeric membrane processes. Ceramic microfiltration of
   model feed solutions containing polyethylene glycol or Suwannee River
   humic acid as well as a synthetic river water was examined, and a
   systematic comparison with polymeric membrane filtration was performed.
   The fouling characteristics of ceramic membranes were investigated for
   the first time using filtration models including the combined pore
   blockage-cake filtration model, constant pressure filtration laws,
   resistance-in-series model, and the unified membrane fouling index
   model. The results suggested that the above models which have been
   applied to polymeric membranes agreed well with the ceramic membrane
   filtration results. The fouling was characterized by the initial pore
   blocking mechanism and transitioned to the cake filtration mechanism at
   a later phase of filtration. Cake resistance was the dominant form of
   the total resistance for ceramic membranes under the conditions tested
   in this study and was readily removable by physical cleaning. The
   results of this study provide basic information upon which further
   in-depth studies can be built, including the effects of water quality,
   membrane characteristics, and operating conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A cost-effective, wafer-level package process for microelectromechanical
   devices (MEMS) is presented. The movable part of MEMS device is
   encapsulated and protected while in wafer form so that commodity,
   lead-frame packaging can be used. A polymer epoxycyclohexyl polyhedral
   oligomericsilsesquioxanes has been used as a mask material to pattern
   the sacrificial polymer as well as overcoat the air-cavity. The
   resulting air-cavities are clean, debris-free, and robust. The cavities
   have substantial strength to withstand molding pressures during
   lead-frame packaging of the MEMS devices. A wide range of cavities from
   20 mu m x 400 mu m to 300 mu m x 400 mu m have been fabricated and shown
   to be mechanically stable. These could potentially house MEMS devices
   over a wide range of sizes. The strength of the cavities has been
   investigated using nano-indentation and modeled using analytical and
   finite element techniques. Capacitive resonators packaged using this
   protocol have shown clean sensing electrodes and good functionality. (C)

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Extremity injuries involving large bone defects with concomitant severe
   muscle damage are a significant clinical challenge often requiring
   multiple treatment procedures and possible amputation. Even if limb
   salvage is achieved, patients are typically left with severe short-and
   long-term disabilities. Current preclinical animal models do not
   adequately mimic the severity, complexity, and loss of limb function
   characteristic of these composite injuries. The objectives of this study
   were to establish a composite injury model that combines a critically
   sized segmental bone defect with an adjacent volumetric muscle loss
   injury, and then use this model to quantitatively assess human bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2)-mediated tissue regeneration and
   restoration of limb function. Surgeries were performed on rats in three
   experimental groups: muscle injury (8-mm-diameter full-thickness defect
   in the quadriceps), bone injury (8-mm nonhealing defect in the femur),
   or composite injury combining the bone and muscle defects. Bone defects
   were treated with 2 mg of rhBMP-2 delivered in the pregelled alginate
   injected into a cylindrical perforated nanofiber mesh. Bone regeneration
   was quantitatively assessed using microcomputed tomography, and limb
   function was assessed using gait analysis and muscle strength
   measurements. At 12 weeks postsurgery, treated bone defects without
   volumetric muscle loss were consistently bridged. In contrast, the
   volume and mechanical strength of regenerated bone were attenuated by
   45\% and 58\%, respectively, in the identically treated composite injury
   group. At the same time point, normalized muscle strength was reduced by
   51\% in the composite injury group compared to either single injury
   group. At 2 weeks, the gait function was impaired in all injury groups
   compared to baseline with the composite injury group displaying the
   greatest functional deficit. We conclude that sustained delivery of
   rhBMP-2 at a dose sufficient to induce bridging of large segmental bone
   defects failed to promote regeneration when challenged with concomitant
   muscle injury. This model provides a platform with which to assess bone
   and muscle interactions during repair and to rigorously test the
   efficacy of tissue engineering approaches to promote healing in multiple
   tissues. Such interventions may minimize complications and the number of
   surgical procedures in limb salvage operations, ultimately improving the
   clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive Radio (CR) networks allow users to opportunistically transmit
   in the licensed spectrum bands, as long as the performance of the
   Primary Users (PUs) of the band is not degraded. Consequently, variation
   in spectrum availability with time and periodic spectrum sensing
   undertaken by the CR users have a pronounced effect on the higher layer
   protocol performance, such as at the transport layer. This paper
   investigates the limitations of classical TCP newReno in a CR ad hoc
   network environment, and proposes TCP CRAHN, a window-based TCP-friendly
   protocol. Our approach incorporates spectrum awareness by a combination
   of explicit feedback from the intermediate nodes and the destination.
   This is achieved by adapting the classical TCP rate control algorithm
   running at the source to closely interact with the physical layer
   channel information, the link layer functions of spectrum sensing and
   buffer management, and a predictive mobility framework that is developed
   at the network layer. An analysis of the expected throughput in TCP
   CRAHN is provided, and simulation results reveal significant
   improvements by using our approach. To the best of our knowledge, our
   approach takes the first steps toward the design of a transport layer
   for CR ad hoc networks.}},

   The key algorithms for this novel digital signal processing scheme

   speech knowledge hierarchy. The final decoded sentence is obtained by
   performing lexical access and applying syntactical constraints. Two key
   factors are critical to warrant a high recognition accuracy, namely: (i)
   generation of high-precision sets of competing hypotheses at every
   intermediate stage; and (ii) low-error pruning of unlikely theories to
   reduce input lattice sizes while maintaining high-quality hypotheses for
   the next layers of knowledge integration. The decoupled nature of the
   proposed techniques allows us to obtain recognition results at all
   stages, including attribute, phone and word levels, and enables an
   integration of various knowledge sources not easily done in the
   state-of-the-art hidden Markov model (HMM) systems based on top-down
   knowledge integration. Evaluation on the Nov92 test set of the
   5000-word, Wall Street Journal task demonstrates that high-accuracy
   attribute and phone classification can be attained. As for word
   recognition, the proposed WFSM-based framework achieves encouraging word
   error rates. Finally, by combining attribute scores with the
   conventional HMM likelihood scores and re-ordering the N-best lists
   obtained from the word lattices generated with the proposed WFSM system,
   the word error rate (WER) can be further reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Cells regulate adhesion in response to internally generated and
   externally applied forces. Integrins connect the extracellular matrix to
   the cytoskeleton and provide cells with mechanical anchorages and
   signaling platforms. Here we show that cyclic forces applied to a
   fibronectin-integrin alpha(5)beta(1) bond switch the bond from a
   short-lived state with 1 s lifetime to a long-lived state with 100 s
   lifetime. We term this phenomenon ``cyclic mechanical reinforcement,{''}
   as the bond strength remembers the history of force application and
   accumulates over repeated cycles, but does not require force to be
   sustained. Cyclic mechanical reinforcement strengthens the
   fibronectin-integrin alpha(5)beta(1) bond through the RGD binding site
   of the ligand with the synergy binding site greatly facilitating the
   process. A flexible integrin hybrid domain is also important for cyclic
   mechanical reinforcement. Our results reveal a mechanical regulation of
   receptor-ligand interactions and identify a molecular mechanism for cell
   adhesion strengthening by cyclic forces.}},

Title = {{On the lack of stratospheric dynamical variability in low-top versions

Abstract = {{We describe the main differences in simulations of stratospheric climate
   and variability by models within the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project (CMIP5) that have a model top above the stratopause and
   relatively fine stratospheric vertical resolution (high-top), and those
   that have a model top below the stratopause (low-top). Although the
   simulation of mean stratospheric climate by the two model ensembles is
   similar, the low-top model ensemble has very weak stratospheric
   variability on daily and interannual time scales. The frequency of major
   sudden stratospheric warming events is strongly underestimated by the
   low-top models with less than half the frequency of events observed in
   the reanalysis data and high-top models. The lack of stratospheric
   variability in the low-top models affects their stratosphere-troposphere
   coupling, resulting in short-lived anomalies in the Northern Annular
   Mode, which do not produce long-lasting tropospheric impacts, as seen in
   observations. The lack of stratospheric variability, however, does not
   appear to have any impact on the ability of the low-top models to
   reproduce past stratospheric temperature trends. We find little
   improvement in the simulation of decadal variability for the high-top
   models compared to the low-top, which is likely related to the fact that
   neither ensemble produces a realistic dynamical response to volcanic
   eruptions. Citation: Charlton-Perez, A. J., et al. (2013), On the lack
   of stratospheric dynamical variability in low-top versions of the CMIP5

Abstract = {{As a key element in the cytoskeleton, actin filaments are highly dynamic
   structures that constantly sustain forces. However, the fundamental
   question of how force regulates actin dynamics is unclear. Using atomic
   force microscopy force-clamp experiments, we show that tensile force
   regulates G-actin/G-actin and G-actin/F-actin dissociation kinetics by
   prolonging bond lifetimes (catch bonds) at a low force range and by
   shortening bond lifetimes (slip bonds) beyond a threshold. Steered
   molecular dynamics simulations reveal force-induced formation of new
   interactions that include a lysine 113(K113):glutamic acid 195 (E195)
   salt bridge between actin subunits, thus suggesting a molecular basis
   for actin catch-slip bonds. This structural mechanism is supported by
   the suppression of the catch bonds by the single-residue replacements
   K113 to serine (K113S) and E195 to serine (E195S) on yeast actin. These
   results demonstrate and provide a structural explanation for actin
   catch-slip bonds, which may provide a mechanoregulatory mechanism to
   control cell functions by regulating the depolymerization kinetics of
   force-bearing actin filaments throughout the cytoskeleton.}},

Abstract = {{We report a rapid method of depositing phosphonic acid molecular groups
   onto conductive metal oxide surfaces. Solutions of pentafluorobenzyl
   phosphonic acid (PFBPA) were deposited on indium tin oxide, indium zinc
   oxide, nickel oxide, and zinc oxide by spray coating substrates heated
   to temperatures between 25 and 150 degrees C using a 60s exposure time.
   Comparisons of coverage and changes in work function were made to the
   more conventional dip-coating method utilizing a 1 h exposure time. The
   data show that the work function shifts and surface coverage by the
   phosphonic acid were similar to or greater than those obtained by the
   dip-coating method. When the deposition temperature was increased, the
   magnitude of the surface coverage and work function shift was also found
   to increase. The rapid exposure of the spray coating was found to result
   in less etching of zinc-containing oxides than the dip-coating method.
   Bulk heterojunction solar cells made of polyhexylthiophene (P3HT) and
   bis-indene-C-60 (ICBA) were tested with PFBPA dip and spray-modified ITO
   substrates as well as
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)
   (PEDOT:PSS)-modified ITO. The spray-modified ITO solar cells showed a
   similar open circuit voltage (V-OC) and fill factor (FF) and a less than
   5\% lower short circuit current density (J(SC)) and power conversion
   efficiency (PCE) than the dip- and PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO. These results
   demonstrate a potential path to a scalable method to deposit phosphonic
   acid surface modifiers on metal oxides while overcoming the limitations
   of other techniques that require long exposure and post-processing
   times.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature dependent current-voltage measurements show that the
   addition of only 10\% Pt to NiSi causes an increase of Schottky barrier
   height (SBH) from 0.65 eV for NiSi to 0.78 eV for the 10\% Pt alloy.
   Internal photoemission measurements resolve two SBHs in all alloyed
   samples with >= 5\% Pt incorporation corresponding to NiSi and PtSi
   (similar to 0.68 eV and similar to 0.80 eV), proving that each
   contributes independently to junction current. High angle annular dark
   field imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms Pt
   segregation to the Ni(Pt)Si/Si interface. The resulting increased SBH
   may therefore be detrimental to contact resistivity in future technology
   nodes. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Inverse opal scaffolds are finding widespread use in tissue engineering
   and regenerative medicine. Herein, the way in which the pore sizes and
   related physical properties of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) inverse
   opal scaffolds are affected by the fabrication conditions is
   systematically investigated. It is found that the window size of an
   inverse opal scaffold is mainly determined by the annealing temperature
   rather than the duration of time, and the surface pore size is largely
   determined by the concentration of the infiltration solution. Although
   scaffolds with larger pore or window sizes facilitate faster migration
   of cells, they show slightly lower compressive moduli than scaffolds
   with smaller pore or window sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Solar energy is potentially the largest source of renewable energy at
   our disposal, but significant advances are required to make photovoltaic
   technologies economically viable and, from a life-cycle perspective,
   environmentally friendly, and consequently scalable. Cellulose
   nanomaterials are emerging high-value nanoparticles extracted from
   plants that are abundant, renewable, and sustainable. Here, we report on
   the first demonstration of efficient polymer solar cells fabricated on
   optically transparent cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) substrates. The solar
   cells fabricated on the CNC substrates display good rectification in the
   dark and reach a power conversion efficiency of 2.7\%. In addition, we
   demonstrate that these solar cells can be easily separated and recycled
   into their major components using low-energy processes at room
   temperature, opening the door for a truly recyclable solar cell
   technology. Efficient and easily recyclable organic solar cells on CNC
   substrates are expected to be an attractive technology for sustainable,
   scalable, and environmentally-friendly energy production.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},

Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{The Gottesman-Knill theorem allows for the efficient simulation of
   stabilizer-based quantum error-correction circuits. Errors in these
   circuits are commonly modeled as depolarizing channels by using Monte
   Carlo methods to insert Pauli gates randomly throughout the circuit.
   Although convenient, these channels are poor approximations of common,
   realistic channels such as amplitude damping. Here we analyze a larger
   set of efficiently simulable error channels by allowing the random
   insertion of any one-qubit gate or measurement that can be efficiently
   simulated within the stabilizer formalism. Our error channels are shown
   to be a viable method for accurately approximating realistic error
   channels. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.87.030302}},

   1.0 x 105 cm that is maintained during bending, rolling, and
   compressing, good adhesion to various flexible substrates, and facile
   processing. The PU-ECA enables various interconnection techniques in
   flexible and printed electronics: it can serve as a die-attach material
   for flip-chip, as vertical interconnect access (VIA)-filling and polymer
   bump materials for 3D integration, and as a conductive paste for

   montmorillonite and hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA(+))-modified
   montmorillonite clays. Simulated system consisted of the clay framework,
   interlayer organic cation, water, and organic sorbate. Their
   interactions were addressed by the combined force field of ClayFF,
   constant-valence force field, and SPC water model. Simulation results
   indicated that in HDTMA coated clay nanopores, diffusion of nonpolar
   species benzene was slowed because they were subjected to influence of
   both the pore wall and the HDTMA surfactant. This suggested the nonpolar
   organic compound diffusion in organophilic clays can be affected by
   molecular size of diffusive species, clay pore size, and organic
   surfactant loading. Additionally, a model that connected the diffusion
   rate of organic compounds in the bulk organoclay matrix with macropores
   and nanopores was established. The impact of intercalated organic
   cations on the diffusion dominated mass transport of organic compounds
   yielded insight into the prediction of the apparent diffusion behavior
   of organic compounds in organic-modified clays.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-dependent transportmeasurements of Ir1-x PtxTe2 are reported.
   With increasing pressure, the structural phase transition at high
   temperatures is enhanced while its superconducting transition at low
   temperatures is suppressed. These pressure effects make Ir1-x PtxTe2
   distinct from other studied TX2 systems exhibiting a charge density wave
   (CDW) state, in which pressure usually suppresses the CDW state and
   enhances the superconducting state. The results reveal that the
   emergence of superconductivity competes with the stabilization of the

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, the major adherens junction adhesion
   molecule in endothelial cells, interacts with p120-catenin and
   beta-catenin through its cytoplasmic tail. However, the specific
   functional contributions of the catenins to the establishment of strong
   adhesion are not fully understood. Here we use bioengineering approaches
   to identify the roles of cadherin-catenin interactions in promoting
   strong cellular adhesion and the ability of the cells to spread on an
   adhesive surface. Our results demonstrate that the domain of VE-cadherin
   that binds to beta-catenin is required for the establishment of strong
   steady-state adhesion strength. Surprisingly, p120 binding to the
   cadherin tail had no effect on the strength of adhesion when the
   available adhesive area was limited. Instead, the binding of VE-cadherin
   to p120 regulates adhesive contact area in a Rac1-dependent manner.
   These findings reveal that p120 and beta-catenin have distinct but
   complementary roles in strengthening cadherin-mediated adhesion.}},

Title = {{The lower extremity dexterity test as a measure of lower extremity
   dynamical capability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{998-1002}},

Abstract = {{The capability of the lower extremity to dynamically interact with the
   ground is important for skilled locomotor performance. However, there is
   currently no test method designed to specifically quantify this
   sensorimotor ability, which we refer to as lower extremity dexterity. We
   describe a new method to quantify lower extremity dexterity, examine its
   reliability (n = 10), and evaluate the extent to which it is associated
   with lower extremity strength and anthropometry in healthy young adults
   (n = 38). The lower extremity dexterity test (LED-test) an adaptation of
   the Strength-Dexterity test for the fingers-consists of using the
   isolated lower extremity to compress a slender spring prone to buckling
   at low forces. The goal of the LED-test is to sustain the highest
   compression force possible. Applying higher forces makes the spring
   increasingly unstable, thus achieving higher compression forces
   represents better ability to dynamically control instability at low
   force levels. As such, the LED-test provides a novel way to quantify the
   capability of the lower extremity to regulate dynamic and unstable
   foot-ground interactions at submaximal forces. LED-test performance
   ranged between 88.6 and 119.6 N, test-retest reliability was excellent
   (ICC(2,3) = 0.94), and the minimal detectable difference was 5.5 N.
   Performance was not correlated with strength or height (r(2) <= 0.053, p
   > 0.05), and only weakly with body mass (r(2) = 0.116, p = 0.04). We
   propose that the unique lower extremity capability quantified by the
   LED-test could be informative of skilled locomotor performance and
   injury risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Structure-Guided Systems-Level Engineering of Oxidation-Prone Methionine
   Residues in Catalytic Domain of an Alkaline alpha-Amylase from
   Alkalimonas amylolytica for Significant Improvement of Both Oxidative
   Stability and Catalytic Efficiency}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{High oxidative stability and catalytic efficiency are required for the
   alkaline alpha-amylases to keep the enzymatic performance under the
   harsh conditions in detergent industries. In this work, we attempted to
   significantly improve both the oxidative stability and catalytic
   efficiency of an alkaline alpha-amylase from Alkalimonas amylolytica by
   engineering the five oxidation-prone methionine residues around the
   catalytic domain via a systematic approach. Specifically, based on the
   tertiary structure analysis, five methionines (Met 145, Met 214, Met
   229, Met 247 and Met 317) were individually substituted with
   oxidation-resistant threonine, isoleucine and alaline, respectively.
   Among the created 15 mutants, 7 mutants M145A, M145I, M214A, M229A,
   M229T, M247T and M317I showed significantly enhanced oxidative stability
   or catalytic efficiency. In previous work, we found that the replacement
   of M247 with leucine could significantly improve the oxidative
   stability. Thus, these 8 positive mutants (M145A, M145I, M214A, M229A,
   M229T, M247T, M247L and M317I) were used to conduct the second round of
   combinational mutations. Among the constructed 85 mutants (25 two-point
   mutants, 36 three-point mutants, 16 four-point mutants and 8 five-point
   mutants), the mutant M145I-214A-229T-247T-317I showed a 5.4-fold
   increase in oxidative stability and a 3.0-fold increase in catalytic
   efficiency. Interestingly, the specific activity, alkaline stability and
   thermal stability of this mutant were also increased. The increase of
   salt bridge and hydrogen bonds around the catalytic domain contributed
   to the significantly improved catalytic efficiency and stability, as
   revealed by the three-dimensional structure model of wild-type alkaline
   alpha-amylase and its mutant M145I-214A-229T-247T-317I. With the
   significantly improved oxidative stability and catalytic efficiency, the
   mutant M145I-214A-229T-247T-317I has a great potential as a detergent
   additive, and this structure-guided systems engineering strategy may be
   useful for the protein engineering of the other microbial enzymes to
   fulfill industrial requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical carbon nanotube (CNT) forests bonded at room temperature with

   high performance thermal interface materials based on CNTs. A spray
   coating process is developed for depositing nanoscale coatings of
   polystyrene and poly-3-hexylthiophene onto CNT forests, as a bonding
   agent that mitigates thermal resistance by enhancing the area available
   for heat transfer at CNT contacts. Resistances as low as 4.9 +/- 0.3
   mm(2) K W-1 are achieved for the entire polymer coated CNT interface
   structure. The suitability of the spray coating process for large-scale
   implementation and the role of polymer and CNT forest thickness in

Abstract = {{The recent two-dimensional (2D) parametric formulation of the high
   fidelity generalized method of cells (HFGMC) reported by the authors is
   generalized for the micromechanical analysis of three-dimensional (3D)
   multiphase composites with periodic microstructure. Arbitrary hexahedral
   subcell geometry is developed to discretize a triply periodic repeating
   unit-cell (RUC). Linear parametric-geometric mapping is employed to
   transform the arbitrary hexahedral subcell shapes from the physical
   space to an auxiliary orthogonal shape, where a complete quadratic
   displacement expansion is performed. Previously in the 2D case,
   additional three equations are needed in the form of average moments of
   equilibrium as a result of the inclusion of the bilinear terms. However,
   the present 3D parametric HFGMC formulation eliminates the need for such
   additional equations. This is achieved by expressing the coefficients of
   the full quadratic polynomial expansion of the subcell in terms of the
   side or face average-displacement vectors. The 2D parametric and
   orthogonal HFGMC are special cases of the present 3D formulation. The
   continuity of displacements and tractions, as well as the equilibrium
   equations, are imposed in the average (integral) sense as in the
   original HFGMC formulation. Each of the six sides (faces) of a subcell
   has an independent average displacement micro-variable vector which
   forms an energy-conjugate pair with the transformed average-traction
   vector. This allows generating symmetric stiffness matrices along with
   internal resisting vectors for the subcells which enhances the
   computational efficiency. The established new parametric 3D HFGMC
   equations are formulated and solution implementations are addressed.
   Several applications for triply periodic 3D composites are presented to
   demonstrate the general capability and varsity of the present parametric
   HFGMC method for refined micromechanical analysis by generating the
   spatial distributions of local stress fields. These applications include
   triply periodic composites with inclusions in the form of a cavity,
   spherical inclusion, ellipsoidal inclusion, and discontinuous aligned
   short fiber. A 3D repeating unit-cell for foam material composite is
   simulated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the critical challenges in producing hollow fiber membranes is
   controlling fiber microstructure. The dope solutions involved possess
   (by design) an inherent thermodynamic sensitivity to phase separation,
   and are therefore susceptible to shear-induced microstructural changes
   when they are subjected to the complicated flow conditions that
   accompany spinning. This study demonstrates that shear-induced demixing
   is relevant in polymeric membrane dopes, and that it can affect
   macrovoid formation. Furthermore, we find that surprisingly subtle
   changes in shear history can affect demixing. Our investigation
   consisted of a two-tier approach. First, we used shear-small-angle light
   scattering (shear-SALS) to observe the microstructural evolution in
   liquid dope solutions before, during, and after shear flow. By varying
   the speed at which samples were syringe-loaded into the rheometer, we
   found that the pattern (and hence, the microstructure) observed after
   demixing varied based on shear history. In the second set of
   experiments, dopes with varying shear histories were extruded into a
   non-solvent bath to form solid fibers. Despite the fact that the fibers
   were all extruded under identical conditions, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) showed that the number of macrovoids observed varied
   widely between fibers. A comparison of the shear-SALS and extrusion
   results showed that shear-demixing is strongly linked to macrovoid
   formation. Our findings suggest that low-shear, upstream flow conditions
   (e.g., in supply tubing) could be just as important for fiber
   microstructure as the high-shear flow within the actual spinneret.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) chemistry has been considered for an alternative
   future generation of rechargeable lithium batteries because of its
   higher theoretical capacity, safer operation and lower material cost.
   Here, we report on the impact of temperature on Li-S cell performance.
   The Li-S coin-cells were prepared by using S infiltrated vertically
   aligned carbon nanotube arrays (S-CNT) as cathodes and lithium metal
   foils as anodes. The cells were operated at 25, 50, 70 and 90 degrees C.
   Higher temperature operation resulted in higher specific capacity,
   better rate capability and more stable performance. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies reveal the major
   impact of temperature on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li
   foil. Thicker SEI with higher content of inorganic phase formed at
   elevated temperatures greatly reduced both the dendrite formation and
   the capacity fading resulted from the irreversible losses of S. At 70
   degrees C specific capacities up to similar to 700 mAh g(-1) were
   achieved at an ultra-high current density of 3.3 A g(-1). At 90 degrees
   C and the same current density Li-S cells showed an average capacity of
   similar to 400 mAh g(-1) and stable performance for over 150 cycles. (C)

Abstract = {{The impact of multifunctional epoxy-based additives on the crosslinking,
   photolithographic properties, and adhesion properties of a tetramethyl
   ammonium hydroxide developable, polynorbornene (PNB)-based dielectric
   was investigated. Three different multifunctional epoxy additives were
   investigated: di-functional, tri-functional, and tetra-functional epoxy
   compounds. The tetra-functional epoxy crosslinker enhanced the UV
   absorbing properties of the polymer at 365 nm wavelength. It was found
   that the epoxy photo-catalyst could be efficiently activated without a
   photosensitizer when the tetra-functional epoxy was used. The polymer
   mixture with additional (3 wt \%) tetra-functional epoxy crosslinker and
   without a UV sensitizer showed improved sensitivity by a factor of 4.7
   as compared to a polymer mixture containing the same number of
   equivalents of non-UV sensitive epoxy with a UV sensitizer. The contrast
   improved from 7.4 for the polymer mixture with non-UV absorbing epoxy
   and a UV sensitizer to 33.4 for the new formulation with 3 wt \%
   tetra-functional epoxy and no UV sensitizer. The addition of the
   tetra-functional epoxy crosslinker also improved the
   polymer-to-substrate adhesion, which permitted longer development times,
   and allowed the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio structures. Hollow-core
   pillars were fabricated in 96-mu m thick polymer films with a
   depth-to-width aspect-ratio of 14 : 1. The degree of crosslinking in the
   cured films was studied by nanoindentation and swelling measurements.

Abstract = {{A positive-tone, aqueous base soluble, polynorbornene (PNB) dielectric
   formulation has been developed. The photolithographic solubility
   switching mechanism is based on diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) inhibition of
   PNB resin functionalized with pendent fluoroalcohol and carboxylic acid
   substituents. The optical contrast (at 365 nm) was found to be 2.3. The
   maximum height-to-width aspect ratio of developed line and space
   features was 3 : 2. The sensitivity, D100, of a formulation containing
   20 pphr of DNQ photoactive compound (PAC) was calculated to be 408 mJ
   cm-2. The effects of the PAC molecule structure on miscibility and
   dissolution of the photosensitive films in aqueous base developer were
   studied. The effect of the monomer composition of the PNB polymer on the
   dissolution rate of the formulated PNB resin was evaluated. A unique
   dissolution and swelling behavior was observed. The effect is attributed
   to a copolymer synthesized with two monomers each of which is
   susceptible to deprotonation in aqueous base. FTIR measurements showed
   that the pure PNBFA has a small percentage of free hydroxyl groups,
   which did not change appreciably by the addition of PAC to the mixture.

Abstract = {{Lithium metal is a potential anode in lithium batteries; however, high
   cycling efficiency has not been achieved. The effect of dissolved gas on
   the reversibility of a Li/Li+ electrode in an ionic liquid electrolyte
   was investigated. The ionic liquid electrolyte was saturated with argon,
   nitrogen, oxygen, air, or carbon dioxide, and the Coulombic efficiency
   for the reduction and reoxidation of lithium metal was measured.
   Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was used to determine the
   thickness and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
   layer formed on the lithium metal. The Coulombic cycling efficiency was
   highest with oxygen, nitrogen, and air. The Coulombic efficiency was
   significantly lower with dissolved carbon dioxide. SIMS revealed that
   the SEI layer was made up of primarily LiF regardless of the gas used.
   The thickness of the SEI layer was the main determinant of cycling
   efficiency. A thinner SEI, observed with nitrogen and oxygen, lead to
   the highest Coulombic efficiency, whereas carbon dioxide produced a
   thick SEI that appeared to inhibit lithium deposition.}},

Title = {{Histological image classification using biologically interpretable
   shape-based features}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Automatic cancer diagnostic systems based on histological
   image classification are important for improving therapeutic decisions.
   Previous studies propose textural and morphological features for such
   systems. These features capture patterns in histological images that are
   useful for both cancer grading and subtyping. However, because many of
   these features lack a clear biological interpretation, pathologists may
   be reluctant to adopt these features for clinical diagnosis.
   Methods: We examine the utility of biologically interpretable
   shape-based features for classification of histological renal tumor
   images. Using Fourier shape descriptors, we extract shape-based features
   that capture the distribution of stain-enhanced cellular and tissue
   structures in each image and evaluate these features using a multi-class
   prediction model. We compare the predictive performance of the
   shape-based diagnostic model to that of traditional models, i.e., using
   textural, morphological and topological features.
   Results: The shape-based model, with an average accuracy of 77\%,
   outperforms or complements traditional models. We identify the most
   informative shapes for each renal tumor subtype from the top-selected
   features. Results suggest that these shapes are not only accurate
   diagnostic features, but also correlate with known biological
   characteristics of renal tumors.
   Conclusions: Shape-based analysis of histological renal tumor images
   accurately classifies disease subtypes and reveals biologically
   insightful discriminatory features. This method for shape-based analysis
   can be extended to other histological datasets to aid pathologists in
   diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.}},

Abstract = {{We report an approach based on a combination of inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for
   quantitative analysis of the role played by Br- ions in the synthesis of
   Pd nanocrystals. The Br- ions were found to adsorb onto Pd\{100\} facets
   selectively with a coverage density of ca. 0.8 ion per surface Pd atom.
   The chemisorbed Br- ions could be removed via desorption at an elevated
   temperature under reductive conditions. They could also be gradually
   released from the surface when Pd cubic seeds grew into cuboctahedrons
   and then octahedrons. On the basis of the coverage density information,
   we were able to estimate the minimum concentration of Br- ions needed
   for the formation of Pd nanocubes with a specific size. If the
   concentration of Br- ions was below this minimum value, not all of the
   \{100\} facets could be stabilized by the capping agent, leading to the
   formation of nanocubes with truncated corners. The quantitative analysis
   developed in this study is potentially extendable to other systems
   involving chemisorbed capping agents.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{A novel n-body potential for an Zr-Nb system was developed in the
   framework of the embedded-atom method. All the parameters of the
   constructed potential have been systematically evaluated by fitting to
   the ground state properties obtained from experimental measurements and
   first-principles calculations for pure elements and some alloys. It is
   shown that most of the static thermodynamics properties for Zr and Nb
   can be well reproduced by using the present potential. Some calculation
   results based on the present model are even closer to the experimental
   data than those based on previous potential models. The ground state
   properties of hypothetical Zr-Nb alloys were also calculated and found
   to be in agreement with first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the
   formation energies of random solid solutions of Zr-Nb with lattices of
   body centered cubic (bcc) and hexagonal close packed (hcp) type were
   calculated by fitting the energy-volume relations to Rose's equation of
   state. These values were compared with those obtained by
   first-principles calculations based on special quasirandom structure
   models and the Miedema-ZSL-07 model (the improved Miedema model proposed
   by Zhang, Sheng and Liu in 2007). It is indicated that our n-body
   constructed potential for a Zr-Nb alloy provides an effective
   description for the interaction between the dissimilar ion interactions
   for hcp-bcc systems.}},

Title = {{Function and design of the Nox1 system in vascular smooth muscle cells}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that the activation of
   NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) plays an important role in the control of
   reactive oxygen species and their involvement in vascular physiology and
   pathophysiology. In order to function properly, Nox1 needs to be
   available in an optimal state, where it is ready to respond
   appropriately and efficiently to upstream signals. It must also be able
   to return quickly to this state as soon as the input signal disappears.
   While Nox1 activation has been discussed extensively in recent years,
   mechanisms for enzyme disassembly and proper subunit recovery have not
   received the same attention and therefore require investigation.
   Results: We study the Nox1 system in vascular smooth smucle cells and
   propose four potential disassembly mechanisms. The analysis consists
   primarily of large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations whose results are
   essentially independent of specific parameter values. The computational
   analysis shows that a specific profile of subunit concentrations is
   crucial for optimal functioning and responsiveness of the system to
   input signals. Specifically, free p47(phox) and inactive Rac1 should be
   dominant under unstimulated resting conditions, and the proteolytic
   disassembly pathway should have a low flux, as it is relatively
   inefficient. The computational results also reveal that the optimal
   design of the three subunit recovery pathways depends on the
   intracellular settings of the pathway and that the response speeds of
   key reversible reactions within the pathway are of great importance.
   Conclusions: Our results provide a systematic basis for understanding
   the dynamics of Nox1 and yield novel insights into its crucially
   important disassembly mechanisms. The rigorous comparisons of the
   relative importance of four potential disassembly pathways demonstrate
   that disassembly via proteolysis is the least effective mechanism. The
   relative significance of the other three recovery pathways varies among
   different scenarios. It is greatly affected by the required response
   speed of the system and depends critically on appropriate flux balances
   between forward and reverse reactions. Our findings are predictive and
   pose novel hypotheses that should be validated with future experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A compact silicon diffractive sensor detecting toluene in solution is

   opposed to spectral-based) detection for increased integrability.
   Precise grating design enables 2-D sensor arrays without the addition of
   separate optical splitters. Detection of the relative diffracted and
   transmitted intensities is independent of attenuation and is thus
   robust. This proof-of-concept sensor is shown to measure toluene
   concentrations as low as 100 parts per million, corresponding to a
   refractive index change of 3 x 10(-4). In addition, a linear sensor
   array with individual sensor addressability and 2-D array capability is

Abstract = {{Immunization using a microneedle patch coated with vaccine offers the
   promise of simplified vaccination logistics and increased vaccine
   immunogenicity. This study examined the stability of influenza vaccine
   during the microneedle coating process, with a focus on the role of
   coating formulation excipients. Thick, uniform coatings were obtained
   using coating formulations containing a viscosity enhancer and
   surfactant, but these formulations retained little functional vaccine
   hemagglutinin ( HA) activity after coating. Vaccine coating in a
   trehalose-only formulation retained about 40-50\% of vaccine activity,
   which is a significant improvement. The partial viral activity loss
   observed in the trehalose-only formulation was hypothesized to come from
   osmotic pressure-induced vaccine destabilization. We found that
   inclusion of a viscosity enhancer, carboxymethyl cellulose, overcame
   this effect and retained full vaccine activity on both washed and
   plasma-cleaned titanium surfaces. The addition of polymeric surfactant,
   Lutrol (R) micro 68, to the trehalose formulation generated phase
   transformations of the vaccine coating, such as crystallization and
   phase separation, which was correlated to additional vaccine activity
   loss, especially when coating on hydrophilic, plasma-cleaned titanium.
   Again, the addition of a viscosity enhancer suppressed the
   surfactant-induced phase transformations during drying, which was
   confirmed by in vivo assessment of antibody response and survival rate
   after immunization in mice. We conclude that trehalose and a viscosity
   enhancer are beneficial coating excipients, but the inclusion of
   surfactant is detrimental to vaccine stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This study reveals that ultra-thin, single-layer metal coatings can be
   used to tailor the deformation resistance of metal thin film surfaces,
   even when the penetration depths of the indents extend well beyond the
   coating layer. Nanoindentation of ultra-thin (<= 20 nm) Ru and Pt
   coatings on thick Au films (350 nm) was used to illustrate how
   ultra-thin layers affect both the elastic and plastic deformation
   behavior. In spite of their (generally) higher hardness compared to Au,
   the Ru and Pt coating systems reduced the deformation resistance of the
   underlying Au, even though the maximum depth was on the order of the
   coating thickness. The effects of coating thickness, mechanical
   properties, and residual stress on the transitions between membrane- and
   substrate-dominated behavior were established by controlling the
   deposition conditions of the layers. The results show that the
   transition from ultra-thin coating- to underlying film-dominated
   response occurs when the indent penetration depth to coating thickness
   ratio is less than similar to 0.5. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Structure-based engineering of histidine residues in the catalytic

   stability and catalytic efficiency under acidic conditions}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to improve the protein stability and catalytic efficiency
   of alpha-amylase from Bacillus subtilis under acidic conditions by
   site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the analysis of a three dimensional
   structure model, four basic histidine (His) residues His(222), His(275),
   His(293), and His(310) in the catalytic domain were selected as the
   mutation sites and were further replaced with acidic aspartic acid
   (Asp), respectively, yielding four mutants H222D, H275D, H293D, H310D.
   The mutant H222D was inactive. Double and triple mutations were further
   conducted and four mutants H275/293D, H275/310D, H293/310D, and
   H275/293/310D were obtained. The acidic stability of enzyme was
   significantly enhanced after mutation, and 45-92\% of initial activity
   of mutants was retained after incubation at pH 4.5 and 25 degrees C for
   24 h, while that for wild-type was only 39.5\%. At pH 4.5, the specific
   activity of wild-type and mutants H275D, H293D, H310D, H275/293D,
   H275/310D, H293/310D, and H275/293/310D were 108.2, 131.8, 138.9, 196.6,
   156.3, 204.6, and 216.2 U/mg, respectively. The catalytic efficiency for
   each active mutant was much higher than that of wild-type at low pH. The
   k(cat)/K-m values of the mutants H275D, H293D, H310D, H275/293D,
   H275/310D, H293/310D, and H275/293/310D at pH 4.5 were 3.3-, 4.3-, 6.5-,
   4.5-, 11.0-, 14.5-, and 16.7fold higher, respectively, than that of the
   wild-type. As revealed by the structure models of the wild-type and
   mutant enzymes, the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges were increased after
   mutation, and an obvious shift of the basic limb toward acidity was
   observed for mutants. These changes around the catalytic domain
   contributed to the significantly improved protein stability and
   catalytic efficiency at low pH. This work provides an effective strategy
   to improve the catalytic activity and stability of alpha-amylase under
   acidic conditions, and the results obtained here may be useful for the
   improvement of acid-resistant ability of other enzymes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Currently, alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG) is industrially produced
   by multi-step chemical synthesis, which can cause heavy environmental
   pollution. Here we reported a simple one-step approach for the
   production of alpha-KG by transforming l-glutamic acid with an
   engineered L-amino acid deaminase (L-AAD) from Proteus mirabilis. First,
   to facilitate the purification of membrane-bound L-AAD, one N-terminal
   transmembrane region (from 21 to 87th nucleotide) was removed from L-AAD
   to block the binding of L-AAD with membrane, and the relatively
   low-usage codons were replaced by high-usage codons in Escherichia coli
   to improve the expression level. However, inclusion bodies formed when
   expressing the Delta N-LAAD in E.coli BL 21, and then the soluble and
   active Delta N-LAAD was obtained by the solubilization and renaturation
   of Delta N-LAAD. Furthermore, the biochemical properties of the refolded
   Delta N-LAAD were characterized and compared with those of full-length
   L-AAD. Finally, the Delta N-LAAD was used to synthesize alpha-KG and the
   maximal formation rate of alpha-KG reached 12.6\% (w/w) at 6 h under the
   following conditions: 12 g/L L-glutamic acid, 0.1 g/L Delta N-LAAD, 5 mM
   MgCl2, temperature 45 degrees C and pH 8.0. Compared with the multi-step
   chemical synthesis, the transformation approach has less environmental
   pollution and has a great potential for alpha-KG production. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Multipotent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are uniquely suited for
   the growing field of regenerative medicine due to their ease of
   isolation, expansion, and transplantation. However, during ex vivo
   expansion necessary to obtain clinically relevant cell quantities, hMSCs
   undergo fundamental changes culminating in cellular senescence. The
   molecular changes as hMSCs transition into senescence have been well
   characterized, but few studies have focused on the mechanical properties
   that govern many processes necessary for therapeutic efficacy. We show
   that before detectable differences in classical senescence markers
   emerge, single-cell mechanical and cytoskeletal properties reveal a
   subpopulation of `non-functioning' hMSCs that appears after even limited
   expansion. This subpopulation, characterized by a loss of dynamic
   cytoskeletal stiffening and morphological flexibility in response to
   chemotactic signals grows with extended culture resulting in overall
   decreased hMSC motility and ability to contract collagen gels. These
   changes were mitigated with cytoskeletal inhibition. Finally, a
   xenographic wound healing model was used to demonstrate that these in
   vitro differences correlate with decreased ability of hMSCs to aid in
   wound closure in vivo. These data illustrate the importance of analyzing
   not only the molecular markers, but also mechanical markers of hMSCs as
   they are investigated for potential therapeutics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Analysis of the residual stress distribution in AlGaN/GaN high electron
   mobility transistors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{A comparative analysis of the residual stress distributions across the
   conductive channel of Ga-face AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistors (HEMTs) is presented. Stress was measured by means of
   micro-Raman spectroscopy and micro-photoluminescence (PL). Raman
   measurements probed the volume average of the stress through the GaN
   layer whereas the stress near the GaN surface (AlGaN/GaN
   heterointerface) was acquired via PL. By combining Raman, PL, and x-ray
   diffraction, a self-consistent method was developed to accurately
   determine the variation in magnitude of stress throughout the thickness
   of the GaN layer. Based on this framework, it is observed in AlGaN/GaN
   HEMTs that a depth variation in the GaN residual stress occurs near the
   gate and ohmic electrodes. At these regions, the stress near the
   AlGaN/GaN interface (or GaN surface) exhibits a tensile shift compared
   to the stress averaged through the entire thickness of GaN. Across the
   conductive channel (away from the metal pads), the bulk average stress
   and the stress near this interface remain nearly identical, showing
   little evidence of a vertical gradient. It is expected that the induced

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a generalized kinetic modeling and experimental approach
   to describe the formation and growth of single-walled metal oxide
   nanotubes. These materials can now be synthesized using solution-based
   methods at temperatures as low as 95 degrees C. Ultimately, it is
   desired to produce nanotubes on a larger scale (e.g., kilogram or ton)
   for technological applications. However, a quantitative multiscale
   understanding of nanotube growth, via a detailed growth model, is
   critical in order to predict and control key properties such as the
   length distribution and concentration of the nanotubes. Such a model can
   then be used to design liquid-phase reactors for scale-up of nanotube
   synthesis. The present model considers three types of species present in
   the synthesis solution: molecular precursors, amorphous nanoparticles,
   and nanotubes. The nucleation of a nanotube embryo is due to the
   rearrangement of an amorphous nanoparticle into an ordered tubular
   structure, as revealed by recent works. The nanotube growth model is
   represented by up to 800 population-balance differential equations.
   Parameterization, validation, and predictive evaluation of the model is
   carried out via detailed statistical TEM measurements of nanotube length
   distributions throughout the synthesis. This model is capable of
   explaining and predicting the evolution of nanotube populations as a
   function of kinetic parameters. It also allows insight into mesoscale
   and microscale nanotube growth processes. For example, it shows that two
   different mechanisms operate during nanotube growth: (1) growth by
   precursor addition, and (2) oriented attachment of nanotubes to each
   other. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ultrametric networks: a new tool for phylogenetic analysis}},
Journal = {{ALGORITHMS FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The large majority of optimization problems related to the
   inference of distance-based trees used in phylogenetic analysis and
   classification is known to be intractable. One noted exception is found
   within the realm of ultrametric distances. The introduction of
   ultrametric trees in phylogeny was inspired by a model of evolution
   driven by the postulate of a molecular clock, now dismissed, whereby
   phylogeny could be represented by a weighted tree in which the sum of
   the weights of the edges separating any given leaf from the root is the
   same for all leaves. Both, molecular clocks and rooted ultrametric
   trees, fell out of fashion as credible representations of evolutionary
   change. At the same time, ultrametric dendrograms have shown good
   potential for purposes of classification in so far as they have proven
   to provide good approximations for additive trees. Most of these
   approximations are still intractable, but the problem of finding the
   nearest ultrametric distance matrix to a given distance matrix with
   respect to the L-infinity distance has been long known to be solvable in
   polynomial time, the solution being incarnated in any minimum spanning
   tree for the weighted graph subtending to the matrix.
   Results: This paper expands this subdominant ultrametric perspective by
   studying ultrametric networks, consisting of the collection of all edges
   involved in some minimum spanning tree. It is shown that, for a graph
   with n vertices, the construction of such a network can be carried out
   by a simple algorithm in optimal time O(n(2)) which is faster by a
   factor of n than the direct adaptation of the classical O(n(3)) paradigm
   by Warshall for computing the transitive closure of a graph. This
   algorithm, called UltraNet, will be shown to be easily adapted to
   compute relaxed networks and to support the introduction of artificial
   points to reduce the maximum distance between vertices in a pair.
   Finally, a few experiments will be discussed to demonstrate the
   applicability of subdominant ultrametric networks.}},

   ambient aerosols, the rate of which is strongly affected by the kinetics
   of water uptake as expressed by the condensation (or mass accommodation)
   coefficient, alpha(c). Estimates of alpha(c) for droplet growth from
   activation of ambient particles vary considerably and represent a
   critical source of uncertainty in estimates of global cloud droplet
   distributions and the aerosol indirect forcing of climate. We present an
   analysis of 10 globally relevant data sets of cloud condensation nuclei
   to constrain the value of alpha(c) for ambient aerosol. We find that
   rapid activation kinetics (alpha(c) > 0.1) is uniformly prevalent. This
   finding resolves a long-standing issue in cloud physics, as the
   uncertainty in water vapor accommodation on droplets is considerably
   less than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Plant pollens are microscopic particles exhibiting a remarkable breadth
   of complex solid surface features. In addition, many pollen grains are
   coated with a viscous liquid, ``pollenkitt{''}, thought to play
   important roles in pollen dispersion and adhesion. However, there exist
   no quantitative studies of the effects of solid surface features or
   pollenkitt on adhesion of pollen grains, and it remains unclear what
   role these features play in pollen adhesion and transport. We report AFM
   adhesion measurements of five pollen species with a series of test
   surfaces in which each pollen has a unique solid surface morphology and
   pollenkitt volume. The results indicate that the combination of surface
   morphology (size and shape of echinate or reticulate features) with the
   pollenkitt volume provides pollens with a remarkably tunable adhesion to
   surfaces. With pollenkitt removed, pollen grains had relatively low
   adhesion strengths that were independent of surface chemistry and
   scalable with the tip radius of the pollen's ornamentation features,
   according to the Hamaker model. With the pollenkitt intact, adhesion was
   up to 3-6 times higher than the dry grains and exhibited strong
   substrate dependence. The adhesion enhancing effect of pollenkitt was
   driven by the formation of pollenkitt capillary bridges and was
   surprisingly species-dependent, with echinate insect-pollinated species
   (dandelion and sunflower) showing significantly stronger adhesion and
   higher substrate dependence than wind-pollinated species (ragweed,
   poplar, and olive). The combination of high pollenkitt volume and large
   convex, spiny surface features in echinate entomophilous varieties
   appears to enhance the spreading area of the liquid pollenkitt relative
   to varieties of pollen with less pollenkitt volume and less pronounced
   surface features. Measurements of pollenkitt surface energy indicate
   that the adhesive strength of capillary bridges is primarily dependent
   on nonpolar van der Waals interactions, with some contribution from the
   Lewis basic component of surface energy.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of asymmetric spherical nanoparticles has attracted great

   building blocks for constructing advanced materials. In this article, we
   report the formation of hemispherical or truncated
   polystyrene/nanosaponite composite particles via one-pot miniemulsion
   polymerization. It was found that the morphology of final composite
   latex particles strongly depends on the size of the nanoclay and its
   surface properties. Hemisphere or truncated sphere is the dominant
   morphology if the size of the nanoclay is larger than 100 nm. With the
   increase of the nanoclay content (up to 30 wt \%), the fraction of
   hemispherical or truncated polystyrene/nanosaponite composite latex
   particles increased accordingly. The formation of hemispherical
   particles is possibly attributed to either the asymmetric growth of
   polymer chains on one side of the hydrophobically modified clay or the
   mechanical peeling-off of large spherical particles between polymer and

   Microsphere-Templating Process}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN POLYMER TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a solvent-free microsphere-templating process was
   developed to fabricate porous elastomers. The process starts with
   preparation of a porous wax template by thermal sintering at a
   temperature close to the wax melting temperature. Then, low-viscosity
   monomers for elastomeric polyurethane were cast into the wax template.
   Finally, after casting and curing of the elastomer, the wax component
   was removed by mechanical forces (centrifuge or squeezing) to produce a
   porous elastomer. With this process, polyurethane scaffolds with a
   co-continuous porous structure were successfully prepared. The optimal
   sintering temperature for the wax template was attained about 4 degrees
   C below the wax peak melting temperature, leading to a stable process
   for joining wax microspheres into a three-dimensional porous template.
   Mechanistic approaches were found to be effective for extracting wax in
   the cast polyurethane; more than 90\% of wax can be simply removed by
   mechanical squeezing above the wax melting temperature. After wax
   removal, the polyurethane demonstrated a morphology with micropores
   interconnected by microchannels, indicating the interconnectivity of the
   porous structure. Tensile tests showed that the resulting porous
   material is highly deformable and elastic, exhibiting typical properties
   of polyurethane elastomers. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Identifying Sets of Constraint Forces by Inspection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A mechanical system is often modeled as a set of particles and rigid
   bodies, some of which are constrained in one way or another. A concise
   method is proposed for identifying a set of constraint forces needed to
   ensure the restrictions are met. Identification consists of determining
   the direction of each constraint force and the point at which it must be
   applied, as well as the direction of the torque of each constraint force
   couple, together with the body on which the couple acts. This important
   information can be determined simply by inspecting constraint equations
   written in vector form. For the kinds of constraints commonly
   encountered, the constraint equations are expressed in terms of dot
   products involving velocities of the affected points or particles and
   angular velocities of the bodies concerned. The technique of expressing
   constraint equations in vector form and identifying constraint forces by
   inspection is useful when one is deriving explicit, analytical equations
   of motion by hand or with the aid of symbolic algebra software, as
   demonstrated with several examples.}},

Title = {{Evaporative Heat Transfer Analysis of a Heat Pipe With Hybrid Axial
   Groove}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Through the application of thin film evaporation theory and the
   fundamental operating principles of heat pipes, a hybrid axial groove
   has been developed that can greatly enhance the performance
   characteristics of conventional heat pipes. This hybrid axial groove is
   composed of a V-shaped channel connected with a circular channel through
   a very narrow longitudinal slot. During the operation, the V-shaped
   channel can provide high capillary pressure to drive the fluid flow and
   still maintain a large evaporative heat transfer coefficient. The large
   circular channel serves as the main path for the condensate return from
   the condenser to the evaporator and results in a very low flow
   resistance. The combination of a high evaporative heat transfer
   coefficient and a low flow resistance results in considerable
   enhancement in the heat transport capability of conventional heat pipes.
   In the present work, a detailed mathematical model for the evaporative
   heat transfer of a single groove has been established based on the
   conservation principles for mass, momentum and energy, and the modeling
   results quantitatively verify that this particular configuration has an
   enhanced evaporative heat transfer performance compared with that of
   conventional rectangular groove, due to the considerable reduction in
   the liquid film thickness and a corresponding increase in the
   evaporative heat transfer area in both the evaporating liquid film
   region and the meniscus region.}},

Title = {{Specialized Algorithm for Navigation of a Micro Hopping Air Vehicle

   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The need for accurate and reliable navigation techniques for micro air
   vehicles plays an important part in enabling autonomous operation.
   Traditional navigation systems typically rely on periodic global
   positioning system updates and provide little benefit when operating
   indoors or in other similarly shielded environments. Moreover, direct
   integration of the onboard inertial measurement unit data stream often
   results in substantial drift errors yielding virtually unusable
   positional information. This paper presents a new strategy for obtaining
   an accurate navigation solution for the special case of a micro hopping
   air vehicle, beginning from some known location and heading, using only
   one triaxial accelerometer and one triaxial gyroscope. Utilizing the
   unique dynamics of the hopping vehicle, a piece-wise navigation solution
   is constructed by selectively integrating the inertial data stream for
   only those short periods of time while the vehicle is airborne. Interhop
   data post processing and sensor bias recalibration are also used to
   further improve estimation accuracy. To assess the performance of the
   proposed algorithm, a series of tests were conducted in which the
   estimated vehicle position following a sequence of 10 consecutive hops
   was compared with measurements from an optical motion-capture system. On
   average, the final estimated vehicle position was within 0.70 m or just
   over 6\% from its actual location based on a total traveled distance of
   approximately 11 m.}},

   variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the
   complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural
   network based system identification eliminates the need to develop
   accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a
   methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator
   concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power
   system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement
   units at generating stations within an area of the system. These
   representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the
   system ``seen{''} by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group
   of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as
   a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning
   mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to
   approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with
   simulations of the system. Results obtained on the 68-bus New
   England/New York benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   method in damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations without
   additional control effort.}},

Abstract = {{It is a grand challenge to visualize and assess in vivo
   neovascularization in a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold noninvasively,
   together with high spatial resolution and deep penetration depth. Here
   we used multiscale photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), including
   acoustic-resolution PAM (AR-PAM) and optical-resolution PAM (OR-PAM), to
   chronically monitor neovascularization in an inverse opal scaffold
   implanted in a mouse model up to 6 weeks by taking advantage of the
   optical absorption contrast intrinsic to hemoglobin molecules in red
   blood cells. By combining with optical coherence tomography (OCT) based
   on optical scattering contrast, we also demonstrated the capability to
   simultaneously image and analyze the vasculature and the scaffold in the
   same mouse. The hybrid system containing OR-PAM and OCT offered a fine
   lateral resolution of similar to 5 mu m and a penetration depth of
   similar to 1 mm into the scaffold/tissue construct. AR-PAM further
   extended the penetration depth up to similar to 3 mm at a lateral
   resolution of similar to 45 mu m. By quantifying the 3D PAM data, we
   further examined the effect of pore size (200 vs. 80 mu m) of a scaffold
   on neovascularization. The data collected from PAM were consistent with
   those obtained from traditional invasive, labor-intensive histologic
   analyses.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Aims and background. Californium-252 (Cf-252) neutron brachytherapy is a
   form of high linear energy transfer radiotherapy, which has proven
   effective when used in combination with external beam radiotherapy to
   treat intracavitary cancers of the cervix, colon/rectum and esophagus.
   No study has been reported for treatment of intracavitary cancers with
   neutron brachytherapy alone. The aim of the study was to observe and
   analyze the long-term curative effects and complications for early stage
   thoracic esophageal cancer patients treated with neutron brachytherapy
   alone.
   Methods. From December 2001 to August 2006, 16 patients of early stage
   squamous cell carcinoma underwent neutron brachytherapy. The total
   radiation dose to the reference point was 20-28 Gy-eq in 5 to 7
   fractions with 4 Gy-eq/fraction. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up rates
   were 100\%.
   Results. The 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates were 100\%, 87.5\%,
   87.5\%, and 75\%, respectively. The early complication rates for grades
   1 and 2 radiation esophagitis were 75\% and 25\%, respectively. The late
   complication rates for grades 0 and 1 (according to the RTOG/EORTC
   standard) were 87.5\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Barium esophagography
   after treatments confirmed that the complete response rate was 100\%.
   Fourteen patients were confirmed by endoscopy to have either normal
   mucosa or inflammation change.
   Conclusions. Neutron brachytherapy alone was an effective and safe
   treatment for early stage esophageal squamous cell cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Process variation causes significant fluctuations in the timing

   This circuit contains a delay generation cell, an input differential
   signal generation cell, a delay matching cell, a sample-hold circuit,
   and a comparator. This circuit was implemented with 0.18 mu m CMOS
   process. Simulation results over process variation, devices mismatch and
   layout parasitics, but without silicon measurement, show that the
   accuracy in delay detection is within 5 ps. A case study was done over a
   feed-forward equalizer (FFE). A typical use of this circuit is testing
   the delay of various FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters.}},

Abstract = {{Amine/oxide hybrid carbon dioxide adsorbents prepared via impregnation
   of low molecular weight polymeric amines into porous oxide supports are
   among the most promising solid adsorbents developed for postcombustion
   CO2 capture or CO2 extraction from ambient air. The oxidative stability
   of adsorbents prepared by impregnation of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) or
   poly(allylamine) (PAA) into mesoporous gamma-alumina under humid
   oxidation conditions is evaluated in this work. The PEI-based
   adsorbents, which contain primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, are
   shown to degrade drastically at elevated temperatures (110 degrees C)
   and in high oxygen concentrations (21\%, akin to air), with these
   effects reduced by both reductions in temperature (70 degrees C) and
   oxygen concentration (5\%, akin to flue gas). The oxidation behavior of
   PEI-based adsorbents supported on alumina is qualitatively similar to
   past work on silica-supported PEI adsorbents. In contrast, the
   alumina-supported PAA adsorbents that contain only primary amines show
   significantly improved oxidative stability, losing only 10\% or less of
   their original CO2 capacity after prolonged oxidative treatment under a
   variety of conditions. Analysis of the fresh and thermally treated
   samples by Fourier transform (FT) IR, FT-Raman, and C-13 NMR
   spectroscopies demonstrates the clear formation of carbonyl
   functionalities over the oxidized PEI-based adsorbents, whereas no
   significant changes in the spectra for PAA samples are observed after
   oxidative treatments. The collected data demonstrate that
   secondary-amine-free, primary-amine-rich polymers such as PAA may be
   used to formulate supported amine adsorbents with improved oxidative
   stability compared to adsorbents based on PEI, which is used
   ubiquitously in the field today.}},

   optical absorption contrasts. Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), the
   microscopic embodiment of PAT, aims to image at millimeter depth and

Abstract = {{The regularity lemma of Szemeredi asserts that one can partition every
   graph into a bounded number of quasi-random bipartite graphs. In some
   applications however, one would like to have a strong control on how
   quasi-random these bipartite graphs are. Alon et al. ('Efficient testing
   of large graphs', Combinatorica 20 (2000) 451-476) obtained a powerful
   variant of the regularity lemma, which allows one to have an arbitrary
   control on this measure of quasi-randomness. However, their proof
   guaranteed only to produce a partition where the number of parts is
   given by the Wowzer function, which is the iterated version of the Tower
   function. We show here that a bound of this type is unavoidable by
   constructing a graph H, with the property that even if one wants a very
   mild control on the quasi-randomness of a regular partition, then the
   number of parts in any such partition of H must be given by a
   Wowzer-type function.}},

   We apply this framework to realize computationally efficient

   algorithms are analyzed; margin-based, water-filling-based, and
   Lagrange-multiplier-based. We extend the water-filling-based power
   allocation algorithm to implement the bit allocation as well. Additional
   techniques for further reducing the computational complexity for all
   three allocation methods are also discussed. Simulation results show
   that both the maximum and the average computational complexity of all
   three allocation algorithms are reduced dramatically by applying the
   DBRIA and the additional techniques. For the water-filling-based
   algorithm, the allocation performance is also improved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) is a promising metal-free catalyst for
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.
   However, its practical application hinges on significant cost reduction
   by using novel synthetic methods and further improvement of the
   catalytic activity by increasing the density of catalytically active
   site. Here we report a low-cost, scalable, synthetic method for
   preparation of NG via pyrolysis of graphene oxide with a rationally
   selected N source polypyrrole. Because of the large number of N atoms in
   pyrrole ring, polypyrrole can facilitate the formation of graphitic N,
   which is considered vital for high catalytic activity. The resulting 3D
   porous structure of NG has an N doping level of 2-3 at\%, of which as
   high as 44\% are graphitic N. Electrochemical characterizations show
   that NG has high catalytic activity toward ORR in an alkaline
   electrolyte via a favorable four-electron pathway for the formation of
   water, leading to high performance and low polarization loss. The NG
   also displays excellent long-term stability and resistance to methanol
   crossover, offering performance characteristics superior to those of a
   commercial Pt/C catalyst. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on the
   structure and property of NG are revealed using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, providing important
   insights into the rational optimization of electrocatalytic activity for
   ORR. In addition, the NG also shows high catalytic activity toward
   oxygen evolution reaction (OER), rendering its potential application as
   a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We used a new ecohydrological model, Visualizing Ecosystems for Land
   Management Assessments (VELMA), to analyze the effects of forest harvest
   on catchment carbon and nitrogen dynamics. We applied the model to a 10
   ha headwater catchment in the western Oregon Cascade Range where two
   major disturbance events have occurred during the past 500 years: a
   stand-replacing fire circa 1525 and a clear-cut in 1975. Hydrological
   and biogeochemical data from this site and other Pacific Northwest
   forest ecosystems were used to calibrate the model. Model parameters
   were first calibrated to simulate the postfire buildup of ecosystem
   carbon and nitrogen stocks in plants and soil from 1525 to 1969, the
   year when stream flow and chemistry measurements were begun. Thereafter,
   the model was used to simulate old-growth (1969-1974) and postharvest
   (1975-2008) temporal changes in carbon and nitrogen dynamics. VELMA
   accurately captured observed changes in carbon and nitrogen dynamics
   before and after harvest. The interaction of hydrological and
   biogeochemical processes in the model provided a means for interpreting
   these changes. Results show that (1) losses of dissolved nutrients in
   the preharvest old-growth forest were generally low and consisted
   primarily of organic nitrogen and carbon; (2) following harvest, carbon
   and nitrogen losses from the terrestrial system to the stream and
   atmosphere increased as a result of reduced plant nitrogen uptake,
   increased soil organic matter decomposition, and high soil moisture; and
   (3) the rate of forest regrowth following harvest was lower than that
   after fire because post-clear-cut stocks and turnover of detritus
   nitrogen were substantially lower than after fire. Citation: Abdelnour,

Abstract = {{Reverse water-level responses in monitoring wells are widely known
   during pumping tests, where they are recognized as the Noordbergum or
   Rhade effects, and a similar response was observed in many of the 100+
   interference slug tests conducted at a well field near Clemson, South
   Carolina. The reverse water-level effect is characterized by a drop in
   pressure head by 1 cm to several centimeters and it occurs in the first
   10-100 s of the test. The reverse response is followed by a rise and
   fall of pressure head that is typical of slug-in tests. The reverse
   water-level response is highly repeatable, and it increases when the
   pressure used to create the slug test is increased. A conceptual model
   recognizes that opening displacement of the fracture wall can cause a
   pressure drop, even when the pressure increases in the wellbore. The
   conceptual model is supported by a closed-form, analytical solution and
   a numerical model that couple fluid pressure and deformation in a
   fracture. Characteristics of the reverse water-level response are
   sensitive to properties of the fracture system and enveloping formation.
   Parameter estimation methods can be used to invert theoretical analyses
   and use the reverse response to improve the characterization of
   fractured rock aquifers. Citation: Slack, T. Z., L. C. Murdoch, L. N.

Abstract = {{A transformation of a Gaussian random field results in a change of the
   spatial dependence. In simple terms, the range and the shape of a
   variogram are different between an underlying Gaussian and a transformed
   Gaussian field. There is a relationship between the underlying and the
   transformed spatial dependence. This paper shows how this relationship
   can be expressed analytically. Rather than generating multidimensional
   random fields and conducting spatial statistical analysis, we develop an
   accurate and efficient approach based on a unique mapping of the
   correlation coefficients of the original multi-Gaussian fields to the
   transformed correlation coefficients to evaluate the spatial correlation
   of transformed non-Gaussian random fields for any type of geostatistical
   parameterization. Such a mapping can also yield accurate estimation of
   the spatial correlation of the underlying Gaussian field given the
   spatial correlation of the transformed field. Results indicate that (1)
   a nonlinear transformation of spatially distributed fields usually
   changes the spatial dependence structure; and (2) the relationship
   between the dependence structures of the underlying and the transformed
   field can be expressed analytically, and it is sufficient to do this in
   one dimension. We use the developed approach to investigate the change
   of correlations of connected random fields generated by the
   absolute-value transformation. Results show (1) the correlation lengths
   of the underlying Gaussian fields are 1.67 and 2.64 times of those of
   transformed non-Gaussian fields for Gaussian and exponential covariance
   models, respectively; (2) the anisotropic ratio does not change; and (3)
   the anticorrelation in hole-effect correlation models disappear.

Abstract = {{The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a new observatory for very
   high-energy (VHE) gamma rays. CTA has ambitions science goals, for which
   it is necessary to achieve full-sky coverage, to improve the sensitivity
   by about an order of magnitude, to span about four decades of energy,
   from a few tens of GeV to above 100 TeV with enhanced angular and energy
   resolutions over existing VHE gamma-ray observatories. An international
   collaboration has formed with more than 1000 members from 27 countries
   in Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America. In 2010 the CTA
   Consortium completed a Design Study and started a three-year Preparatory
   Phase which leads to production readiness of CTA in 2014. In this paper
   we introduce the science goals and the concept of CTA, and provide an
   overview of the project. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mitigation of aero-optical aberrations in the wake of a
   surface-mounted turret comprised of a hemisphere mounted on a matching
   cylindrical support is investigated in wind tunnel experiments. The
   effects of hybrid (passive/active) flow control on the aero-optical and
   aerodynamic characteristics of the flow over a conformal optical
   aperture embedded in the hemispherical cap are investigated at M = 0.3
   and Re-D = 4.46 x 10(6). Direct optical diagnostics of 2D wavefronts
   over the aperture is performed using a high-speed Shack-Hartmann
   wavefront sensor for a range of aperture orientations on and off the
   streamwise center plane. Aerodynamic flow diagnostics includes arrays of
   static and dynamic pressure ports on the turret and the ground plane
   that help characterize flow separation and the wake topology. The global
   flow is passively controlled by a forward-facing partition plate that
   increases the flow receptivity to and the effectiveness of arrays of
   high-frequency fluidic oscillating jets that are placed upstream of the
   aperture. It is shown that the hybrid flow control yields significant
   improvements in the aero-optical characteristics of the flow over the
   aperture that exceeds the individual effects of passive and active
   control.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the evaluation of expected tardiness of an order at the time
   of arrival in an M/M/c queuing system with N priority classes,
   considering both nonpreemptive and preemptive service disciplines. Upon
   arrival, a customer order is quoted a lead time of d, and placed in the
   queue according to the priority class of the customer. Orders within the
   same priority class are processed on a first-come, first-served basis.
   We derive the Laplace transforms of the expected tardiness of the order
   given the quoted lead time, priority class of the order, and system
   status. For the special case of single priority class, the Laplace
   transform can be inverted into a closed-form expression. For the case
   with multiple priority classes, a closed-form expression cannot be
   obtained, hence, we develop three customized numerical inverse Laplace
   transformation algorithms. Two of these algorithms provide upper and
   lower bounds for the expected tardiness under a simple condition on
   system parameters. Using this property, we obtain error bounds for our
   customized algorithms; such bounds are not available for general purpose
   numerical inversion algorithms in the literature. Next, we develop a
   novel methodology to compare the precision of general purpose numerical
   inversion algorithms and analyze the performances of three algorithms
   from the literature. Finally, we provide a recommendation scheme given
   computational time and error tolerances of the decision maker. The
   methods developed in this paper for the accurate estimation of expected
   tardiness establish an important step toward developing due date
   quotation policies in a multiclass queue, contributing to the due date
   quotation literature that has been largely focused on single-class
   queues.}},

Abstract = {{Such concurrent systems as Web services and work-flow systems can be
   viewed as a composition of a set of subsystems. Subsystems interact with
   each other through a set of message channels in order to perform a task.
   This work defines a class of Petri nets called interactive Petri nets
   (IPNs) to model these systems. IPNs can be used to analyze their
   behavior, find potential problems, and then improve their designs.
   Compatibility is an important concept for a composed system and reflects
   the possibility of correct/proper interaction among its subsystems. In
   order to characterize different cooperative abilities in practice,
   compatibility and weak compatibility are defined for IPNs. Some
   relationships among (weak) compatibility, liveness, reversibility, and
   boundedness are revealed. Based on them, this work proves that the
   (weak) compatibility problem is co-NP-hard. A taxonomy is also presented
   for IPNs in order to explore whether some subclasses can be analyzed
   efficiently. Based on it, we can identify several IPN subclasses, some
   of which can be analyzed in polynomial time.}},

Abstract = {{New propagation techniques using magnetic induction (MI) waveguide
   solves the problems of traditional techniques in many challenged
   environments, such as underground, mines/tunnels, and oil reservoirs.
   However, deploying MI waveguides to connect the wireless nodes in such
   networks is challenging due to the high deployment cost, the complex
   shape of the communication range of the MI waveguides, and the
   significant impacts of the node failure and relay coil displacement. To
   date, the deployment problems in the MI-based networks have not been
   addressed. In this paper, the optimal MI waveguide deployment strategies
   are investigated in both one and two dimensional MI-based networks where
   the nodes are distributed either randomly or according to a regular
   lattice. Validated by both theoretical deduction and simulations, the
   proposed deployment strategies can construct a reliable MI-based network
   that is robust to node failure and relay coil displacement with minimum
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{We consider two variants of a probabilistic set covering (PSC) problem.
   The first variant assumes that there is uncertainty regarding whether a
   selected set can cover an item, and the objective is to determine a
   minimum-cost combination of sets so that each item is covered with a
   prespecified probability. The second variant seeks to maximize the
   minimum probability that a selected set can cover all items. To date,
   literature on this problem has focused on the special case in which
   uncertainties are independent. In this paper, we formulate deterministic
   mixed-integer programming models for distributionally robust PSC
   problems with correlated uncertainties. By exploiting the
   supermodularity of certain substructures and analyzing their polyhedral
   properties, we develop strong valid inequalities to strengthen the
   formulations. Computational results illustrate that our modeling
   approach can outperform formulations in which correlations are ignored
   and that our algorithms can significantly reduce overall computation

Abstract = {{This paper investigates fish-like aquatic robotics using flexible
   bimorphs made of macro-fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric laminates for
   carangiform locomotion. In addition to noiseless and efficient actuation
   over a range of frequencies, geometric scalability, and simple design,
   bimorph propulsors made of MFCs offer a balance between the actuation
   force and velocity response for performance enhancement in bio-inspired
   swimming. The experimental component of the presented work focuses on
   the characterization of an elastically constrained MFC bimorph propulsor
   for thrust generation in quiescent water as well as the development of a
   robotic fish prototype combining a microcontroller and a
   printed-circuit-board amplifier to generate high actuation voltage for
   untethered locomotion. From the theoretical standpoint, a
   distributed-parameter electroelastic model including the hydrodynamic
   effects and actuator dynamics is coupled with the elongated-body theory
   for predicting the mean thrust in quiescent water. In-air and underwater
   experiments are performed to verify the incorporation of hydrodynamic
   effects in the linear actuation regime. For electroelastically nonlinear
   actuation levels, experimentally obtained underwater vibration response
   is coupled with the elongated-body theory to predict the thrust output.
   The measured mean thrust levels in quiescent water (on the order of
   similar to 10 mN) compare favorably with thrust levels of biological
   fish. An untethered robotic fish prototype that employs a single bimorph
   fin (caudal fin) for straight swimming and turning motions is developed
   and tested in free locomotion. A swimming speed of 0.3
   body-length/second (7.5 cm s(-1) swimming speed for 24.3 cm body length)
   is achieved at 5 Hz for a non-optimized main body-propulsor bimorph
   combination under a moderate actuation voltage level.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the effect of fiber composition and morphology, as
   altered by various papermaking processes, on internal curing performance
   of hardwood eucalyptus pulp fibers. The autogenous deformations of
   cement pastes containing each of five different eucalyptus
   pulps-unbleached soda pulp, bleached soda pulp, unbleached kraft pulp,
   bleached kraft pulp, and semi-chemical pulp-were examined and analyzed
   in the context of the known relevant chemical composition and
   morphology, e.g., cellulose-to-hemicellulose ratio, cell wall thickness,
   and ``hard to remove{''} (HR) water content. The results revealed that
   the internal curing efficiency of these pulps is related more strongly
   to their physical morphology than chemical composition, as measured by
   cellulose-to-hemicellulose ratio. The partial defiberization during
   mechanical treatment associated with semi-chemical pulping resulted in
   fiber fracture and also produced materials which were poorly
   dispersible; together, these factors limit internal curing capability of
   semi-chemical pulp. The soda fibers, both unbleached and bleached, with
   their thicker cell wall and higher HR water content were more effective
   for internal curing than kraft fibers. It is proposed that for hardwood
   pulp fibers a slower rate of entrained water release is beneficial for
   internal curing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{DOI: 10.2514/1.C031529 The optimized profile descent is an example of
   one of the many NextGen technologies under development to modernize and
   increase the efficiency of the national airspace system. The first
   publicly charted optimized profile descent procedure was implemented at
   Los Angeles International Airport in December 2007. This new flight
   procedure was designed so that aircraft could conduct arrival and
   approach operations with the engines remaining at or near minimum idle
   power settings; thereby, saving an average of 25 gal of jet fuel per
   flight when compared to the various aircraft types conducting an arrival
   and approach along the same lateral path at Los Angeles International
   Airport. This optimized profile descent translates into annual
   reductions of approximately 2,000,000 gal of jet fuel and 41,000,000 lb
   of carbon dioxide emissions. Given the positive environmental benefits
   of an optimized profile descent, there are several projects underway to
   increase the use of environmentally friendly arrival procedures within
   the national airspace system. The aforementioned achievement at Los
   Angeles International Airport has motivated and enabled new optimized
   profile descent procedure designs for Atlanta, Miami, Charleston, and
   Phoenix.}},

Abstract = {{DOI: 10.2514/1.C031690 Highly complex and coupled nature of the National
   Airspace System makes it challenging to understand the safety
   implications of changes to its operations. A comprehensive assessment of
   the hazards associated with the introduction of new technologies must
   involve modeling of interactions among aircraft behavior, supporting
   infrastructure, and the operational procedures. The traditional approach
   to risk assessment does not focus on the relative timing of relevant
   events. The likelihoods of those events are computed externally, usually
   by means of physics-based simulations, which, while increasingly
   realistic in capturing physical phenomena, are limited to describing
   only few relevant interactions to keep the overall complexity tractable.
   This paper discusses an intermediate layer of analysis with enough
   fidelity to capture time-dependent coupling among relevant entities of
   the system that is compact enough to track a large number of those
   relevant entities simultaneously. To this end, Stochastic Petri nets are
   used to analyze the conflict resolution between the merging flows of air
   traffic for optimized-profile-descent approaches. Stochastic Petri nets
   are coupled with agent-based simulation, and the efficiency of the
   merging procedures and their sensitivity to wind conditions and the
   traffic patterns are analyzed. Finally, compact modeling of two
   off-nominal scenarios related to future procedures is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Active trailing-edge flaps are a method of aerodynamic control under
   extensive research to reduce the detrimental effects of dynamic stall.
   Physical phenomena are poorly understood in the context of active flaps
   including vorticity and acoustics, separation, and transition. In
   addition, discrete trailing-edge flaps create a cavity-like flow within
   the airfoil-flap gap that can complicate these phenomena. This work has
   explored the physical response of a static airfoil with a discrete
   noncontoured oscillating flap over a range of freestream parameters. The
   effects of attached and separated flows, flap oscillation scheduling,
   airfoil-flap gap size, and freestream speed have all been investigated.
   Time-accurate predictions were performed using a hybrid
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes/large eddy simulation turbulence model.
   Trailing-edge stall suppression and an increase between aerodynamic
   response and deflection input were observed as the flap oscillation
   frequency increased. The lag between response and input also increased
   approximately linearly with airfoil-flap gap size. Results indicated the
   transition was unaffected by the flap oscillations. During the frequency
   content of flow the unsteadiness was consistent with separated flow
   driven by the flap. Discrete noncontoured flaps are not recommended; if
   they are required, the size of the gap should be minimized to maintain
   performance and reduce lag.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of slosh-control techniques have required feedback control
   to suppress liquid oscillations induced by container motion. Input
   shaping is an alternative method for generating motion commands that
   reduce slosh without the need for sensors. This paper provides a
   rigorous theoretical process for designing multimode and robust input
   shapers for slosh suppression. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the
   input-shaping method is more effective than traditional
   command-smoothing methods. This paper describes the design of four
   different input shapers that reduce multiple slosh frequencies and have
   robustness to frequency changes that can occur in containers of sloshing
   liquids. The performance of the input shapers is then compared with
   typical unshaped and smooth commands. Experimental results show that
   input shaping can robustly reduce slosh amplitude over a range of liquid
   depths.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence-based design (EBD) originated in the healthcare industry as a
   combination of evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice. EBD
   is a process for creating or improving healthcare buildings by using
   rigorous evidence to create benchmarks of current practices, achieve
   specific goals, and then monitor the success of the design to inform
   future decision making. EBD studies for the healthcare industry are
   compiled into an international database to provide design information to
   all users. This paper reviews applications of EBD in healthcare and
   other fields, assesses the potential value of applying EBD in the
   transportation field, and makes recommendations that can help with the
   adoption of EBD for transportation design and engineering. Emerging
   areas such as transportation asset management, health impact assessments
   and green design are particularly appropriate and promising for the
   development and application of EBD databases. This paper is a useful
   resource for transportation executives or researchers who are interested
   in developing evidence-based databases to guide their future decision
   making to be more strategic to take advantage of proven successful
   applications. When appropriately applied, EBD has the potential to
   reduce costs and risks while increasing innovation and encouraging new
   ideas for transportation and other projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Although MnO2 is a promising material for supercapacitors (SCs) due to
   Its excellent electrochemical performance and natural abundance, its
   wide application is limited by poor electrical conductivity. Inspired by
   our results that the electrochemical activity and electrical
   conductivity of ZnO nanowires were greatly improved after hydrogenation,
   we designed and fabricated hydrogenated single-crystal ZnO@amorphous
   ZnO-doped MnO2 core-shell nanocables (HZM) on carbon doth as SC
   electrodes, showing excellent performance such as areal capacitance of
   138.7 mF/cm(2) and specific capacitance of 1260.9 F/g. Highly flexible
   all-solid-state Ks were subsequently assembled with these novel HZM
   electrodes using polyvinyl alcohol/LiCl electrolyte. The working devices
   achieved very high total areal capacitance of 26 mF/cm2 and retained
   87.5\% of the original capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge
   cycles. An integrated power pack incorporating series-wound 5Cs and
   dye-sensitized solar cells was demonstrated for stand-alone self-powered
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si)-based solar cell Is by far the most established solar cell
   technology. The surface of a SI solar cell is usually covered by a layer
   of transparent material to protect the device from corrosion,
   contamination and mechanical damage. Here, we replaced this protection
   layer by a thin layer film of polydimethysiloxane nanowires. Based on
   this layer and using the conductive layer on the surface of the wavy Si,
   we have fabricated a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The solar cell
   and the TENG form a hybrid energy cell for simultaneously harvesting
   solar and mechanical energies. The hybrid energy cell can be directly
   used for self-powered electrodegradation of rhodamine 13, where the
   degradation percentage is up to 98\% in 10 min. Moreover, the produced
   energy can also be stored in the Li-ion batteries for driving some
   personal electronics such as a red laser diode and a commercial cell
   phone.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the immense literature in porous material generation,
   micropatterning of porous devices remains a technical challenge. In this
   study, a new process for micropatterning of porous structures with a
   controllable morphology was developed and investigated. This process
   combines polymer melt blending, hot embossing, and in-mold annealing for
   geometrical pattern transfer and simultaneous morphological control. A
   special effort was made to generate a microgroove pattern with an open
   pore structure. Parametric experimental studies were conducted on stamps
   with different feature sizes under different processing conditions. The
   results demonstrated the feasibility and the versatility of the proposed
   technique in fabricating micropatterned porous structures. By varying
   the geometrical and boundary conditions during in-mold annealing,
   micropatterns with graded porous structures were demonstrated. (c) 2012

   the lateral performance of circular RC columns}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{43-54}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the bond behavior between steel reinforcing bars and
   concrete confined via steel wrapping jackets is estimated. Lateral
   bending tests are conducted for the reinforced concrete columns with
   continuous longitudinal reinforcement or lap-spliced longitudinal bars
   confined by the steel wrapping jackets. It is found that the jackets
   increase the bond strength and ductile behavior due to the transfer of
   splitting bonding failure to pull-out bonding failure. In the column
   tests, the steel wrapping jackets increase the flexural strength and
   ultimate drift for the lap-spliced column. However, the jacket for the
   column with continuous longitudinal reinforcement only increases the
   ultimate drift since the flexural strength depends on the yield of
   reinforcement. Finally, this study suggests a basic concept for
   determination of the thickness of the steel wrapping jackets which is
   different from the conventional method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The paper proposes a control-theoretic framework for verification of

   important application of control and systems theory. The idea is to
   transfer Lyapunov functions and the associated computational techniques
   from control systems analysis and convex optimization to verification of
   various software safety and performance specifications. These include
   but are not limited to absence of overflow, absence of division-by-zero,
   termination in finite time, absence of dead-code, and certain
   user-specified assertions. Central to this framework are Lyapunov
   invariants. These are properly constructed functions of the program
   variables, and satisfy certain properties-analogous to those of Lyapunov
   functions-along the execution trace. The search for the invariants can
   be formulated as a convex optimization problem. If the associated
   optimization problem is feasible, the result is a certificate for the
   specification.}},

   traveling-wave tube (TWT) performance is affected by random fabrication
   errors, which are modeled as random perturbations of the phase velocity,
   interaction impedance, and loss along the TWT's length. In particular,
   we examine the effect on TWT gain and instantaneous 1-dB bandwidth.
   Random variation of the phase velocity is found to have the largest
   effect on both the gain and bandwidth, but the impact is reduced as the
   amount of space charge in the beam is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum carbide nanoclusters supported on alumina were promoted by
   Rb2CO3 and tested for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. At 573 K and
   30 bar syngas (H-2/CO = 1), the promoted catalyst demonstrated 63\%
   selectivity to alcohols (on a CO2-free basis), with hydrocarbons and
   ethers as side products. In contrast, the alcohol selectivity of an
   unpromoted Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst was very low. DRIFTS of adsorbed CO on
   MO2C/Al2O3 revealed a significant red shift in the CO band with added Rb
   promoter, which correlated to a decrease in hydrocarbon production rate
   and therefore an increase in alcohol selectivity. A quantum chemical
   description of CO adsorbed on a model Mo2C surface identified several
   possible binding modes of the CO. Both reactivity studies and DRIFTS of
   adsorbed CO demonstrated that mobility of the Rb promoter was enhanced
   in the presence of water vapor, which facilitates dispersion of Rb
   across the catalyst surface and effectively neutralizes acid sites that
   are deleterious to alcohol selectivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the Grand River plume, a major tributary of Lake
   Michigan, was studied in the vicinity of the Grand Haven coast on the
   east side of the lake. The river spread laterally from the mouth and
   formed a thin surface buoyant plume with various shapes that have not
   been previously reported. To understand the influence of different
   driving forces, primarily wind, buoyancy, and ambient currents,
   extensive field experiments were carried out over four periods in August
   and June 2006, and June and July 2007. They included aerial photography
   over the plume, acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) deployments,
   meteorological buoys, drifters, SF6 and Rhodamine WT tracer releases,
   three-dimensional (3D) CTD profiling over the plume, and CTD casts at
   the river mouth. The results showed more flow classes than included in
   previous studies. A modified classification scheme based on the relative
   magnitude of the plume-crossflow length scale and a Richardson number
   were devised that includes longshore current components and
   onshore-offshore wind effects. A ratio of length scales and the
   Richardson number could predict whether the plume was shore attached or
   unattached, and how the onshore wind can spread the unattached plume
   offshore, deflect it back to shore, or diffuse it. DOI:

Abstract = {{We introduce in this paper a new mixture of regressions model which is a
   generalisation of the semiparametric two-component mixture model studied
   in Bordes, Delmas, and Vandekerkhove {[}(2006b), Semiparametric
   Estimation of a Two-component Mixture Model When a Component is Known',
   Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 33, 733752]. Namely, we consider a
   two-component mixture of regressions model in which one component is
   entirely known while the proportion, the slope, the intercept, and the
   error distribution of the other component are unknown. Our model is said
   to be semiparametric in the sense that the probability density function
   (pdf) of the error involved in the unknown regression model cannot be
   modelled adequately by using a parametric density family. When the pdfs
   of the errors involved in each regression model are supposed to be
   zero-symmetric, we propose an estimator of the various (Euclidean and
   functional) parameters of the model, and establish under mild conditions
   their almost sure rates of convergence. Finally, the implementation and
   numerical performances of our method are discussed using several
   simulated data sets and one real high-density array data set (ChIP-mix

Abstract = {{Temperature is one of many important environmental variables that can
   impact the long-term performance, strength, and deformation
   characteristics of many man-made construction materials, including
   geosynthetics. The functional engineering properties of these materials
   must remain within acceptable limits during their service life to ensure
   that the overall design and performance are acceptable. In the case of
   geosynthetics used in landfills and other applications, laboratory
   interface shear tests are performed under standard test conditions,
   including temperature. Information emerging today shows that
   geosynthetic interfaces (i.e., in landfill liner applications)
   experience elevated temperatures resulting from exothermic reactions
   occurring in the waste body, amongst other factors. To this end, the
   field conditions at elevated temperatures should also be simulated in
   the laboratory during physical/mechanical laboratory tests in order for
   researchers to better understand in situ functional engineering
   properties and operational performance of manmade geo-construction
   materials. For this purpose, a temperature-controlled chamber was
   designed and developed to allow the shear behavior of geosynthetic
   geosynthetic and soil geosynthetic interfaces to be evaluated at
   different temperatures. This paper describes both the development and
   the validation of the test system. The results of experimental
   investigations are presented to illustrate how the shear behavior of
   interfaces between nonwoven polypropylene geotextile and smooth and/or
   textured high density polyethylene geomembrane, as well as those between
   rounded and/or angular sand and geomembranes, change with temperature.
   The results provide insight into the importance of being able to
   independently control this variable during mechanical testing in the
   laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous scanning laser Doppler vibrometry (CSLDV) obtained sweeping
   a single laser beam along a periodic scan pattern allows measuring
   surface vibrations at many points simultaneously by demultiplexing the
   CSLDV signal. This known method fundamentally differs from conventional
   scanning laser vibrometry techniques in which the laser beam is kept at
   a fixed point during each measurement and then moved to a new position
   prior to the next measurement. This article demonstrates the use of a
   CSLDV for measuring in a non-contact fashion the velocity of
   low-frequency surface waves (f < 100 Hz) propagating over soft
   materials, namely here gel surfaces-mimicking human body soft
   tissues-and skeletal muscles, to develop an affordable and noninvasive
   elastography modality. The CSLDV vibration measurements obtained with a
   single laser beam, linearly scanned over the test surface at 200 Hz over
   lengths up to 6 cm, were validated using an array of three fixed laser
   Doppler vibrometers distributed along the same scan line. Furthermore,
   this CSLDV setup was used to measure the increase in surface wave
   velocity over the biceps brachii muscle which was directly correlated to
   the actual stiffening of the biceps occurring while a subject was
   performing voluntary contractions at an increasing level. (C) 2013

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1503-1514}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Pulse compression is normally applied only to time-invariant systems, as
   the variation of a system's properties during its interrogation violates
   assumptions of the compression process. However, there is an exact
   solution to the pulse-compression problem when the time variance
   satisfies two criteria, which are the same as those required for the
   operation of an ultrasonic vibrometer in the context of a tissue
   elastography system. One is that the variations be very small in
   comparison with the wavelength of the interrogating ultrasound. The
   other is that the bandwidth of the variations be within one Nyquist band
   as sampled by the periodic interrogation signal. The solution to this
   problem involves a step-wise interpolation of the static
   pulse-compression transfer function in the frequency domain. This
   technique, in conjunction with the selection of an appropriate
   interrogation signal, offers significant advantages in measurement time
   or measurement resolution for an ultrasonic vibrometer limited by
   additive noise at the receiver. The characteristics of optimal
   interrogation signals for this technique are the signal's crest factor,
   spectral energy distribution, and phasing. These relate to the intended
   compression pulse, the noise, and the static response of the system. The
   technique has been demonstrated analytically, experimentally, and with
   numerical models. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided waves are gaining acceptance for structural health
   monitoring and nondestructive evaluation of plate-like structures. One
   configuration of interest is a spatially distributed array of fixed
   piezoelectric devices. Typical operation consists of recording signals
   from all transmit-receive pairs and subtracting pre-recorded baselines
   to detect changes, possibly due to damage or other effects. While
   techniques such as delay-and-sum imaging as applied to differential
   signals are both simple and capable of detecting flaws, their
   performance is limited, particularly when there are multiple damage
   sites. Here a very different approach to imaging is considered that
   exploits the expected sparsity of structural damage; i.e., the structure
   is mostly damage-free. Differential signals are decomposed into a sparse
   linear combination of location-based components, which are pre-computed
   from a simple propagation model. The sparse reconstruction techniques of
   basis pursuit denoising and orthogonal matching pursuit are applied to
   achieve this decomposition, and a hybrid reconstruction method is also
   proposed and evaluated. Noisy simulated data and experimental data
   recorded on an aluminum plate with artificial damage are considered.
   Results demonstrate the efficacy of all three methods by producing very
   sparse indications of damage at the correct locations even in the
   presence of model mismatch and significant noise. (C) 2013 Acoustical

   user-programmable diameter-modulated superstructures with sub-100 nm

Abstract = {{In this report, facile fabrication of wafer-scale nickel (Ni) nanocone
   (NC) dot arrays as field emitters is demonstrated. Ni NC dot arrays are
   fabricated on silicon wafers using conventional photolithography and
   electrodeposition. Ni NCs with an average height of 400 nm grew in less
   than 3 min. Patterned Ni NC dot arrays exhibited enhanced field emission
   compared with plain Ni NCs. Field emission measurements of the plain NCs
   and patterned NC dot arrays revealed that the turn-on field of patterned
   NC dot arrays (3.23 V/mu m) is lower than that of plain NCs (3.93 V/mu
   m), while the field enhancement factor of patterned NC dot arrays (5087)
   is greater than that of plain NCs (2705). Our approach to form patterned
   Ni NC dot arrays is a simple, fast, cost-effective, and scalable method
   to fabricate effective field emitters. It is suitable for producing
   large-scale, patterned NC arrays for application in flat-panel displays
   and electron sources. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a thorough approach characterizing the spiraling
   motion of underwater gliders. The dynamic model for underwater gliders,
   steered by a single internal movable and rotatable mass, is established.
   Spiraling motions are equilibria of the dynamics, for which equations
   are derived and then solved by a recursive algorithm with fast
   convergence. This theoretical method is applied to the Seawing
   underwater glider whose hydrodynamic coefficients are computed using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software packages. In a recent
   experiment in the South China Sea, the Seawing glider produced a
   spiraling motion against strong ocean current, agreeing with theoretical
   predictions. Hence the recursive algorithm may be used to compute
   control input to achieve desired spiraling motion for underwater gliders
   in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Spatial Pattern Dynamics of 3D Stem Cell Loss of Pluripotency via
   Rules-Based Computational Modeling}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the unique ability to
   differentiate into cells from all germ lineages, making them a
   potentially robust cell source for regenerative medicine therapies, but
   difficulties in predicting and controlling ESC differentiation currently
   limit the development of therapies and applications from such cells. A
   common approach to induce the differentiation of ESCs in vitro is via
   the formation of multicellular aggregates known as embryoid bodies
   (EBs), yet cell fate specification within EBs is generally considered an
   ill-defined and poorly controlled process. Thus, the objective of this
   study was to use rules-based cellular modeling to provide insight into
   which processes influence initial cell fate transitions in 3-dimensional
   microenvironments. Mouse embryonic stem cells (D3 cell line) were
   differentiated to examine the temporal and spatial patterns associated
   with loss of pluripotency as measured through Oct4 expression. Global
   properties of the multicellular aggregates were accurately recapitulated
   by a physics-based aggregation simulation when compared to
   experimentally measured physical parameters of EBs. Oct4 expression
   patterns were analyzed by confocal microscopy over time and compared to
   simulated trajectories of EB patterns. The simulations demonstrated that
   loss of Oct4 can be modeled as a binary process, and that associated
   patterns can be explained by a set of simple rules that combine baseline
   stochasticity with intercellular communication. Competing influences
   between Oct4+ and Oct4- neighbors result in the observed patterns of
   pluripotency loss within EBs, establishing the utility of rules-based
   modeling for hypothesis generation of underlying ESC differentiation
   processes. Importantly, the results indicate that the rules dominate the
   emergence of patterns independent of EB structure, size, or cell
   division. In combination with strategies to engineer cellular
   microenvironments, this type of modeling approach is a powerful tool to
   predict stem cell behavior under a number of culture conditions that
   emulate characteristics of 3D stem cell niches.}},

Title = {{Coordinability and Consistency in Accident Causation and Prevention:
   Formal System Theoretic Concepts for Safety in Multilevel Systems}},
Journal = {{RISK ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{420-433}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although a system approach to accidents in sociotechnical systems has
   been frequently advocated, formal system theoretic concepts remain
   absent in the literature on accident analysis and system safety. To
   address this gap, we introduce the notions of coordinability and
   consistency from the hierarchical and multilevel systems theory
   literature. We then investigate the applicability and the importance of
   these concepts to accident causation and safety. Using illustrative
   examples, including the worst disaster in aviation history, and recent
   incidents in the United States of aircraft clipping each other on the
   tarmac, we propose that the lack of coordinability is a fundamental
   failure mechanism causing or contributing to accidents in multilevel
   systems. We make a similar case for the lack of consistency.
   Coordinability and consistency become ingredients for accident
   prevention, and their absence fundamental failure mechanisms that can
   lead to system accidents. Finally, using the concepts introduced in this
   work, we identify several venues for further research, including the
   development of a theory of coordination in multilevel systems, the
   investigation of potential synergies between coordinability,
   consistency, and the high reliability organizations paradigm, and the
   possibility of reframing the view that sloppy management is the root
   cause of many industrial accidents as one of lack of coordinability
   and/or consistency between management and operations. By introducing and
   expanding on the concepts of coordinability and consistency, we hope to
   contribute to the thinking about, and the to language of, accident
   causation, and prevention and to add to the intellectual toolkit of
   safety professionals and academics.}},

Abstract = {{Critical care patients undergoing surgery require drug administration to
   regulate physiological variables such as blood pressure, cardiac output,
   heart rate, and degree of consciousness. The rate of infusion of each
   administered drug is critical, requiring constant monitoring and
   frequent adjustments. Patients in the intensive care unit who require
   mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure also frequently
   require the administration of sedative agents. Open-loop control (manual
   control) by clinical personnel can be tedious, imprecise,
   time-consuming, and sometimes of poor quality, depending on the skills
   and judgment of the clinician. Dynamical system pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic modeling and closed-loop control system design
   methodologies can significantly advance our understanding of the wide
   effects of pharmacological agents and anesthetics, as well as advance
   the state-of-the-art in active control of drug delivery systems for
   clinical pharmacology. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and
   opportunities of clinical decision support and closed-loop control for
   intensive care unit sedation.}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examine the maximum net extraction rate from the novel
   arrangement of an injection-extraction well pair in a coastal aquifer,
   where fresh groundwater is reinjected through the injection well located
   between the interface toe and extraction well. Complex potential theory
   is employed to derive a new analytical solution for the maximum net
   extraction rate and corresponding stagnation-point locations and
   recirculation ratio, assuming steady-state, sharp-interface conditions.
   The injection-extraction well-pair system outperforms a traditional
   single extraction well in terms of net extraction rate for a broad range
   of well placement and pumping rates, which is up to 50\% higher for an
   aquifer with a thickness of 20 m, hydraulic conductivity of 10 m/d, and
   fresh water influx of 0.24 m2/d. Sensitivity analyses show that for a
   given fresh water discharge from an inland aquifer, a larger maximum net
   extraction is expected in cases with a smaller hydraulic conductivity or
   a smaller aquifer thickness, notwithstanding physical limits to drawdown
   at the pumping well that are not considered here. For an extraction well
   with a fixed location, the optimal net extraction rate linearly
   increases with the distance between the injection well and the sea, and
   the corresponding injection rate and recirculation ratio also increase.
   The analytical analysis in this study provides initial guidance for the
   design of well-pair systems in coastal aquifers, and is therefore an
   extension beyond previous applications of analytical solutions of
   coastal pumping that apply only to extraction or injection wells.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a new equation of state for a H-2-He-H2O-CH4 mixture is
   presented. The equation is optimized for the deep jovian atmosphere
   (similar to 100 bars) where the NASA Juno Microwave Radiometer (MWR)
   will probe. The methodology used is based upon that of Lemmon and
   Jacobsen (Lemmon, E.W., Jacobsen, R.T. {[}2004]. J. Phys. Chem. Ref.
   Data 33, 593-+) and Kunz et al. (Kunz, 0., Klimeck, R., Wagner, W.,
   Jaeschke, M. {[}2006]. Technical Monograph, VDI-Verlag). This
   methodology is used in combination with available published
   thermodynamic measurements and with new pressure-Volume-Temperature
   (PVT) measurements of H-2-H2O mixtures conducted with the jovian
   simulator described in Karpowicz and Steffes (Karpowicz, B.M., Steffes,
   P.G. {[}2011]. Icarus 212, 210-223). In addition to being necessary to
   interpret laboratory measurements, the new equation of state is
   important in developing temperature pressure profiles of the deep jovian
   atmosphere. This is demonstrated by incorporating the new equation of
   state into an updated version of the DeBoer (DeBoer, D.R. {[}1995].

Abstract = {{A novel design of a highly sensitive wireless passive RF strain
   transducer is presented based on a patch antenna loaded with an open
   loop that is capable of sensing strain independently in two directions.
   An original idea of utilizing a cantilever at the gap of the open loop
   significantly improves the sensitivity of resonant frequency shifts. The
   frequency shifts in two distinct resonant modes are detected based on
   two dominant orthogonal modes of the patch resonators. In measurements,
   the prototypes achieved a sensitivity of 2.35\% frequency shift per 1\%
   strain, more than twice that of existing strain transducers of the same
   class. In simulations, the new design achieved a theoretical sensitivity
   up to four times as high as existing designs of RF passive wireless
   strain transducers. The ground plane allows for the sensitivity of the
   sensor to be independent from the applied surface. An implementation
   example of the passive remote sensing system based on the proposed
   strain transducer is alsodiscussed as a proof-of-concept case. Based on
   calculations, the interrogation method in the example shows a radar
   cross section fluctuation of 3.8 dB corresponding to the strain induced
   at the sensor.}},

   experimental and analytical studies of the coupled heat and mass

   binary and higher order mixtures in vertical and horizontal smooth and
   enhanced tubes are discussed. For zeotropic mixtures the heat and mass

   heat transfer resistance beyond what would be expected from a weighted
   average of corresponding resistances for the pure components. There are
   significant opportunities to improve the quality of available data for

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{119-125}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When seeking low-metal targets, the success rate of an electromagnetic
   induction (EMI) system is often determined by the susceptibility of the
   soil near the object. In this paper, we begin the process of
   characterizing a random soil in terms of its effect on EMI sensor
   readings. After providing a brief review of the theory behind how soil
   susceptibilities affect EMI measurements, we measure the
   susceptibilities of 43 samples of soil from the United States, Puerto
   Rico, Iraq, and Afghanistan using a custom susceptibility sensor. We
   define a set of metrics and give the distribution of values for how
   magnetically active the soils are, how dispersive they are, and how well
   the commonly used log model fits to their susceptibility as a function
   of frequency. All measurements taken in the study are consistent with
   the log model of susceptibility if one accounts for the noise floor of
   the sensor. The sensor used for the measurements is described briefly
   and validated using a set of magnetic salts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This research focuses on airport gates, which are limited resources in
   the air transportation system. In spite of its importance, ramp
   congestion has not been considered in traditional research on gate
   assignment. This research, therefore, proposes a new perspective on the
   gate assignment problem that accounts for ramp congestion, as well as
   passenger flow. The proposed gate assignment problem minimizes weighted
   nominal taxi time and weighted taxi delay, as well as passenger transit
   time in the terminal. Nominal taxi time and taxi delay are weighted by
   the number of passengers on board. As a result, the flow in the
   passenger terminal and on ramps becomes efficient. To get near-optimal
   solutions within a reasonable amount of time, two metaheuristic
   algorithms, tabu search and genetic algorithm, are implemented for two
   ramp configurations. Also, the tradeoff between passenger flow and ramp
   congestion is analyzed.}},

Title = {{Objective models of compressed breast shapes undergoing mammography}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop models of compressed breasts undergoing mammography
   based on objective analysis, that are capable of accurately representing
   breast shapes in acquired clinical images and generating new, clinically
   realistic shapes.
   Methods: An automated edge detection algorithm was used to catalogue the
   breast shapes of clinically acquired cranio-caudal (CC) and
   medio-lateral oblique (MLO) view mammograms from a large database of
   digital mammography images. Principal component analysis (PCA) was
   performed on these shapes to reduce the information contained within the
   shapes to a small number of linearly independent variables. The breast
   shape models, one of each view, were developed from the identified
   principal components, and their ability to reproduce the shape of
   breasts from an independent set of mammograms not used in the PCA, was
   assessed both visually and quantitatively by calculating the average
   distance error (ADE).
   Results: The PCA breast shape models of the CC and MLO mammographic
   views based on six principal components, in which 99.2\% and 98.0\%,
   respectively, of the total variance of the dataset is contained, were
   found to be able to reproduce breast shapes with strong fidelity (CC
   view mean ADE = 0.90 mm, MLO view mean ADE = 1.43 mm) and to generate
   new clinically realistic shapes. The PCA models based on fewer principal
   components were also successful, but to a lesser degree, as the
   two-component model exhibited a mean ADE = 2.99 lima for the CC view,
   and a mean ADE = 4.63 mm for the MLO view. The four-component models
   exhibited a mean ADE = 1.47 mm for the CC view and a mean ADE = 2.14 mm
   for the MLO view. Paired t-tests of the ADE values of each image between
   models showed that these differences were statistically significant (max
   p-value = 0.0247). Visual examination of modeled breast shapes confirmed
   these results. Histograms of the PCA parameters associated with the six
   principal components were fitted with Gaussian distributions. The
   six-component model was also used to generate CC and MLO view mammogram
   breast shapes, using the mean PCA parameter values of these
   distributions and randomly generated values based on the fitted Gaussian
   distributions, which resemble clinically encountered breasts. A

Abstract = {{The stability of a 1 wt \% Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst was tested in an
   ethanol/water mixture at 225 C and autogenic pressure, conditions at
   which it is possible to dissolve and depolymerize various kinds of
   lignin, and structural changes to the catalysts were studied by means of
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Al-27 MAS NMR, N-2 physisorption, transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), H-2 chemisorption elemental analysis
   thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), and IR. In the
   absence of reactants the alumina support is found to transform into
   boehmite within 4 h, leading to a reduction in support surface area,
   sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles, and a reduction of active
   metal surface area. Addition of aromatic oxygenates to mimic the
   compounds typically obtained by lignin depolymerization leads to a
   slower transformation of the support oxide. These compounds, however,
   were not able to slow down the decrease in dispersion of the Pt
   nanoparticles. Vanillin and guaiacol stabilize the aluminum oxide more
   than phenol, anisole, and benzaldehyde because of the larger number of
   oxygen functionalities that can interact with the alumina.
   Interestingly, catalyst samples treated in the presence of lignin showed
   almost no formation of boehmite, no reduction in support or active metal
   surface area, and no Pt nanoparticle sintering. Furthermore, in the
   absence of lignin-derived aromatic oxygenates, ethanol forms a coke-like
   layer on the catalyst, while oxygenates prevent this by adsorption on
   the support by coordination via the oxygen functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{Brain tumor invasion leads to recurrence and resistance to treatment.
   Glioma cells invade in distinct patterns, possibly determined by
   microenvironmental cues including chemokines, structural heterogeneity,
   and fluid flow. Wehypothesized that flow originating from pressure
   differentials between the brain and tumor is active in glioma invasion.
   Using in vitro models, we show that interstitial flow promotes cell
   invasion in multiple glioma cell lines. Flow effects were
   CXCR4-dependent, because they were abrogated by CXCR4 inhibition.
   Furthermore, CXCR4 was activated in response to flow, which could be
   responsible for enhanced cell motility. Flow was seen to enhance cell
   polarization in the flow direction, and this flow-induced polarization
   could be blocked by CXCR4 inhibition or CXCL12 oversaturation in the
   matrix. Furthermore, using live imaging techniques in a
   three-dimensional flow chamber, there were more cells migrating and more
   cells migrating in the direction of flow. This study shows that
   interstitial flow is an active regulator of glioma invasion. The new
   mechanisms of glioma invasion that we identify here-namely, interstitial
   flow-enhanced motility, activation of CXCR4, and CXCL12-driven
   autologous chemotaxis- are significant in therapy to prevent or treat
   brain cancer invasion. Current treatment strategies can lead to edema
   and altered flow in the brain, and one popular experimental treatment in
   clinical trials, convection enhanced delivery, involves enhancement of
   flow in and around the tumor. A better understanding of how interstitial
   flow at the tumor margin can alter chemokine distributions, cell
   motility, and directed invasion offers a better understanding of
   treatment failure. Cancer Res; 73(5); 1536-46. (C) 2012 AACR.}},

Title = {{Multiuser Spectral Precoding for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{345-352}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is an ideal
   transmission technique for cognitive radio (CR) systems because of its
   flexible nature to support dynamic spectrum access. However, the
   out-of-band (OOB) radiation of OFDM signals from different CR users must
   be strictly controlled to protect licensed users operating in the
   adjacent frequency bands. In this paper, we propose a spectral precoding
   approach for multiple OFDM-based CR users to reduce OOB leakage and
   enhance spectrum compactness. By constructing individual precoders to
   render selected spectrum nulls, our approach suppresses the overall OOB
   radiation without sacrificing biterror rate performance of CR users. The
   proposed approach also ensures user independence thus with low encoding
   and decoding complexities. Furthermore, our approach can improve
   bandwidth efficiency by carefully selecting notched frequencies. As a
   comprehensive application of the proposed approach, two simplified
   multiuser spectral precoding schemes are provided to reduce the
   computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our
   spectral precoding schemes effectively limit OOB radiation and enable
   efficient spectrum sharing.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of resource allocation optimization is
   studied for a single-cell multiuser cognitive radio network in the
   presence of primary user networks. The spectral access of the cognitive
   radio network is based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
   (OFDMA). A joint bandwidth and power allocation is performed so that
   users' rate requirements are satisfied, and the integrity of primary
   user communication is preserved. In this work, two unique challenges are
   addressed. The first is the incorporation of primary user activity in
   the design of resource allocation technique, and the second is the
   limited hardware capabilities of cognitive terminals compared to those
   available at the cognitive base station. To address these problems, a
   novel resource allocation framework is proposed based on the
   bandwidth-power product minimization, which is an effective metric in
   evaluating the spectral resource consumption in a cognitive radio
   environment. The framework takes into consideration the challenges
   aforementioned. The results show significant enhancement in spectral
   efficiency by using our framework compared to classical power adaptive
   optimization using iterative waterfilling scheme.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{514-522}},

Abstract = {{The heavy tailed nature exhibited in both primary and secondary users'
   traffic fundamentally challenges the performance limit of dynamic
   spectrum access (DSA) networks under the conventional light tailed
   assumptions. This paper provides an asymptotic analysis of the
   steady-state queue length distribution of secondary users (SUs) under
   the heavy tailed network environment. Specifically, two network
   scenarios are investigated. In the first scenario where each SU has its
   exclusive access to a primary user (PU) channel, it is shown that the
   heavy tailed nature of either the PU traffic or the SU traffic can make
   SUs experience heavy tailed queue length with unbounded moments. In the
   second scenario where multiple SUs share a single PU channel, the
   queuing performance under throughput optimal scheduling policies is
   studied. It is proven that if the PU traffic has a heavier tail than any
   SU traffic, the queue length of each SU is at least one order heavier
   than the PU traffic under any scheduling policy. Otherwise, if the
   traffic from at least one of the SUs has a heavier tail than the PU
   traffic, it is proven that the celebrated throughput-optimal maximum
   weight scheduling leads to the worst possible asymptotic queuing
   performance for SUs by letting each SU queue have the heaviest possible
   tail. On the contrary, it is shown that there always exists a feasible
   set of beta parameters such that the maximum weight-beta scheduling
   yields the best asymptotic performance for the SU queues by letting each
   queue have the lightest possible tail.}},

Abstract = {{Device mismatch has long prevented the implementation of accurate high
   density analog computation. This paper presents the Reconfigurable
   Analog Signal Processor (RASP) 2.9a, a 350 nm double-poly CMOS chip
   designed for the implementation of accurate analog computation. The chip
   is the densest field programmable analog array (FPAA) to date,
   containing over 130 k programmable floating gate switch elements (SWEs).
   The paper reviews an algorithm for rapidly programming the charge on
   floating gate switch elements with 10.2 bit accuracy. An automated
   algorithm based on the EKV transistor model is developed to rapidly
   characterize device mismatch, the Early effect, capacitive drain
   coupling, and temperature dependent behavior. This paper empirically
   verifies the characterization, using the precise floating gate
   programming methods to offset the errors and create current sources with
   2.2\% RMS error over a dynamic range of 25 dB. The current sources are
   then modified to create current mirrors and vector-matrix multipliers,
   accurate for currents down to 8 nA. Together with the computational
   analog blocks, these linear circuits can be synthesized into a wide
   range of extremely low power linear and nonlinear functions. The
   calibration routine, in combination with preexisting design tools,
   allows the automated synthesis, placement, and accurate programming of
   large classes of circuits on an FPAA.}},

   It is shown via the convex domination technique that quantization may
   result in an increase in the case of the second moment, but the increase
   is bounded above by. The result is then applied to decentralized
   sequential detection problems not only to provide simpler sufficient
   conditions for asymptotic optimality theories in the simplest models,

   brief remarks on other higher-order moments of the log-likelihood ratio

Abstract = {{Sustainable consumption has been defined as ``the consumption of goods
   and services that meet basic needs and quality of life without
   jeopardizing the needs of future generations{''} (OECD, 2002). Lifespan
   extension of durable products underpins sustainable consumption. This
   paper describes a novel approach to extend product lifespans by using
   product servicing that conceptualizes the interactions of a producer, a
   policy-maker, and multiple consumer segments having different
   price-demand relationships. We propose a multi-period mathematical
   optimization model that maximizes the producer's profit while optimizing
   the prices of different servicing options, production quantities, and
   inventory levels. A computational study elicits several insights about
   how the optimal production (or alternatively) consumption quantities are
   affected by the introduction of product servicing, and the effects of
   various product characteristics and government incentive or penalty
   levels on producer's profitability and on product servicing decisions.
   We conclude that quantitative optimization models are useful for
   evaluating the impacts of different regulatory policies, assessing the
   benefits of offering product servicing options, and investing in design
   for durability and serviceability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Microtextured implant surfaces increase osteoblast differentiation in
   vitro and enhance bone-to-implant contact in vivo and clinically. These
   implants may be used in combination with recombinant human bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) to enhance peri-implant bone
   formation. However, the effect of surface modifications alone or in
   combination with rhBMP-2 on the osteoblast-produced inflammatory
   microenvironment is unknown. MG63 cells were cultured on tissue culture
   polystyrene or titanium substrates: smooth pretreated (PT, Ra = 0.2 mu
   m), sandblasted/acid-etched (SLA, Ra = 3.2 mu m) or hydrophilic-SLA
   (modSLA). Expression and protein production of pro-inflammatory
   interleukins (IL1b, IL6, IL8, IL17) and anti-inflammatory interleukins
   (IL10) were measured in cells with or without rhBMP-2. To determine
   which BMP signaling pathways were involved, cultures were incubated with
   BMP pathway inhibitors to blockSmad (dorsomorphin), TAB/TAK1
   ((5Z)-7-oxozeaenol) or PKA (H-8) signaling. Culture on rough SLA and
   modSLA surfaces decreased pro-inflammatory interleukins and increased
   anti-inflammatory IL10. This effect was negated in cells treated with
   rhBMP-2, which caused an increase in pro-inflammatory interleukins and a
   decrease in anti-inflammatory interleukins through TAB/TAK signaling.
   The results suggest that surface microtexture modulates the inflammatory
   process during osseointegration, an effect that may enhance healing.
   However, rhBMP-2 in combination with microtextured titanium implants can
   influence the effect of cells on these surfaces, and may adversely
   affect cells involved in osseointegration. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Prior studies have measured elevated ambient concentrations of hazardous
   metals in Beijing, attributable to coal combustion. The 2008 Olympic
   Games led to an intense investment in air pollution controls at the
   major power plants in the region, accounting for 30\% of coal combustion
   in Beijing. Recently Chinese coal beds have been characterized in the
   World Coal Quality Index, facilitating the development of trace metal
   emission factors for Beijing coals. This study quantifies the relative
   value of the power plant air pollution controls in terms of public
   health risk from chronic exposure to trace metals. Ambient
   concentrations from power plants were estimated using an atmospheric
   dispersion model (CALPUFF), outlining spatial and temporal variations.
   The following toxic, refractory metals were evaluated for health risk
   using the USEPA Integrated Risk Information System: antimony, arsenic,
   beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, nickel,
   and selenium. Stringent use of power plant air pollution controls
   significantly reduces population risk, averting a cancer risk of 1 in
   5,000. However, other sources of coal combustion, such as industrial and
   household uses, are more relevant to public health than power plant
   emissions. Coal washing has potential to reduce the hazard from these
   diffuse sources and avert a greater number of potential cancer cases.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00459.2012.-Elastin fragmentation is a common
   characteristic of vascular diseases, such as abdominal aortic aneurysms,
   peripheral arterial disease, and aortic dissection. Examining growth and
   remodeling in the presence of dysfunctional elastic fibers provides
   insight into the adaptive or maladaptive changes that tissues undergo in
   compensating for structural deficiencies. This study used the maturation
   of fibulin-5 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice to study the effects of
   fragmented elastic fibers on the growth and remodeling of carotid
   arteries. The microstructural content and organization and the biaxial
   mechanical behavior of common carotid arteries were measured, and
   parameter estimation performed from KO and WT mice aged 3, 4, 8, and 13
   wk. Gross measurements and biaxial tests revealed significant
   differences in pressure-diameter behavior, in vivo axial stretch,
   opening angle, compliance, and wall stresses during maturation of
   wild-type arteries, but little change in these values in KO mice.
   Multiphoton microscopy used to image collagen fibers across the vessel
   wall in pressurized and stretched arteries suggests that there is little
   variation in fiber angles between different ages. Parameter estimation
   revealed significant differences in material parameters between
   genotypes and age groups. This study suggests that neonatal formation
   and cross-linking of functional elastic fibers, followed by increases in
   artery size due to growth with little remodeling of the elastic fibers,
   endow arteries with large distensibility and contribute to the evolution
   of mechanical behavior of arteries during maturation. Dysfunction in
   neonatal formation of elastic fibers abrogates many of the changes in
   mechanical response that take place during the maturation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an optimization modeling approach for analyzing the
   trade-off between the cost of a larger fleet of tractors and the cost of
   repositioning tractors for a trucking company operating a consolidation
   network, such as a less-than-truckload (LTL) company. Specifically, we
   analyze the value of using extra tractor repositioning moves (in
   addition to the ones required to balance resources throughout the
   network) to reduce the fixed costs of owning or leasing a tractor fleet
   during a planning horizon. We develop network flow optimization models,
   some with side constraints and nonlinear objective functions, using
   event-based, time-expanded networks to determine appropriate fleet sizes
   and extra repositioning moves under different repositioning strategies,
   and we compare the optimal costs of the strategies. For repositioning
   costs, two different cost schemes are explored: one linear and one
   nonlinear. Computational experiments using real data from a national LTL
   carrier compare the total system costs obtained with four different
   strategies and show that extra repositioning may indeed enable fleet
   size reductions and concomitant cost savings.}},

Abstract = {{As the power of studying mouse genetics and behavior advances, research
   tools to examine systems level connectivity in the mouse are critically
   needed. In this study, we compared statistical mapping of the olfactory
   system in adult mice using manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) with probabilistic tractography. The primary goal
   was to determine whether these complementary techniques can determine
   mouse olfactory bulb (OB) connectivity consistent with known anatomical
   connections. For MEMRI, 3D T1-weighted images were acquired before and
   after bilateral nasal administration of MnCl2 solution. Concomitantly,
   high-resolution diffusion-tensor images were obtained ex vivo from a
   second group of mice and processed with a probabilistic tractography
   algorithm originating in the OB. Incidence maps were created by
   co-registering and overlaying data from the two scan modalities. The
   resulting maps clearly show pathways between the OB and amygdala,
   piriform cortex, caudate putamen, and olfactory cortex in both the DTI
   and MEMRI techniques that are consistent with the known anatomical
   connections. These data demonstrate that MEMRI and DTI are
   complementary, high-resolution neuroimaging tools that can be applied to
   mouse genetic models of olfactory and limbic system connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Consideration of soil as a living ecosystem offers the potential for
   innovative and sustainable solutions to geotechnical problems. This is a
   new paradigm for many in geotechnical engineering. Realising the
   potential of this paradigm requires a multidisciplinary approach that
   embraces biology and geochemistry to develop techniques for beneficial
   ground modification. This paper assesses the progress, opportunities,
   and challenges in this emerging field. Biomediated geochemical
   processes, which consist of a geochemical reaction regulated by
   subsurface microbiology, currently being explored include mineral
   precipitation, gas generation, biofilm formation and biopolymer
   generation. For each of these processes, subsurface microbial processes
   are employed to create an environment conducive to the desired
   geochemical reactions among the minerals, organic matter, pore fluids,
   and gases that constitute soil. Geotechnical applications currently
   being explored include cementation of sands to enhance bearing capacity
   and liquefaction resistance, sequestration of carbon, soil erosion
   control, groundwater flow control, and remediation of soil and
   groundwater impacted by metals and radionuclides. Challenges in
   biomediated ground modification include upscaling processes from the
   laboratory to the field, in situ monitoring of reactions, reaction
   products and properties, developing integrated biogeochemical and
   geotechnical models, management of treatment by-products, establishing
   the durability and longevity/reversibility of the process, and education
   of engineers and researchers.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost linearity test methodology for high-resolution
   analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is presented in this paper.
   Linearity testing of ADCs requires high-precision digital-to-analog
   conversion (DAC) capability, commonly 3-bit higher resolution than the
   ADC under test. Further, a large number of ADC output data samples must
   be collected making conventional histogram testing impractical for
   high-resolution ADCs with 18-24 bit precision. In the proposed test
   methodology, two low-precision and low-cost DACs are used to generate a
   high-resolution ADC test stimulus. Significant reductions in test cost
   and test time are achieved by using low-cost instrumentation and by
   making fewer measurements than required for conventional histogram test.
   A least-squares-based polynomial fitting approach is used to determine
   the transfer function of the ADC under test. The generated transfer
   function is used to compute the non-linearity of the ADC accurately. No
   assumption is made regarding the linearity of the lower precision signal
   generators (DACs) used in the testing procedure. Software simulations
   and hardware experiments are performed to validate the proposed test
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Scaffolds with open-pore morphologies offer several advantages in
   cell-based tissue engineering, but their use is limited by a low
   cell-seeding efficiency. We hypothesized that inclusion of a collagen
   network as filling material within the open-pore architecture of
   polycaprolactonetricalcium phosphate (PCLTCP) scaffolds increases human
   bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) seeding efficiency under perfusion
   and in vivo osteogenic capacity of the resulting constructs. PCLTCP
   scaffolds, rapid prototyped with a honeycomb-like architecture, were
   filled with a collagen gel and subsequently lyophilized, with or without
   final crosslinking. Collagen-free scaffolds were used as controls. The
   seeding efficiency was assessed after overnight perfusion of expanded
   hBMSCs directly through the scaffold pores using a bioreactor system. By
   seeding and culturing freshly harvested hBMSCs under perfusion for
   3weeks, the osteogenic capacity of generated constructs was tested by
   ectopic implantation in nude mice. The presence of the collagen network,
   independently of the crosslinking process, significantly increased the
   cell seeding efficiency (2.5-fold), and reduced the loss of clonogenic
   cells in the supernatant. Although no implant generated frank bone
   tissue, possibly due to the mineral distribution within the scaffold
   polymer phase, the presence of a non-crosslinked collagen phase led to
   in vivo formation of scattered structures of dense osteoids. Our
   findings verify that the inclusion of a collagen network within open
   morphology porous scaffolds improves cell retention under perfusion
   seeding. In the context of cell-based therapies, collagen-filled porous
   scaffolds are expected to yield superior cell utilization, and could be
   combined with perfusion-based bioreactor devices to streamline graft
   manufacture. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It has been more than 20 years since Bialek and colleagues published a
   landmark paper asking a seemingly innocuous question: what can we
   extract about the outside world from the spiking activity of sensory
   neurons? Can we read the neural code? Although this seemingly simple
   question has helped us shed light on the neural code, we still do not
   understand the anatomical and neurophysiological constraints that enable
   these codes to propagate across synapses and form the basis for
   computations that we need to interact with our environment. The
   sensitivity of neuronal activity to the timing of synaptic inputs
   naturally suggests that synchrony determines the form of the neural
   code, and, in turn, regulation of synchrony is a critical element in
   `writing' the neural code through the artificial control of
   microcircuits to activate downstream structures. In this way, reading
   and writing the neural code are inextricably linked.}},

Title = {{Bayesian framework for assessing the value of scientific space systems:
   Value of information approach with application to earth science

Abstract = {{Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or
   transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the
   space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of
   information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of
   a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the
   value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian
   framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are
   viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information
   recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update
   their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher
   expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in
   expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this
   idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the
   value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian
   framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by
   considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions
   taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these
   actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an
   Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig
   operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholders'
   beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated
   with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to
   clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value,
   and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to
   justify the acquisition of the system. Additionally, the system is
   analyzed in Cost-VOD trade space to provide program managers with
   additional insights into the coupling of a system's predicted value
   generation and its associated lifecycle cost. (C) 2012 IAA. Published by

Abstract = {{Background. This study was undertaken to evaluate an in vitro mitral
   valve (MV) simulator's ability to mimic the systolic leaflet coaptation,
   regurgitation, and leaflet mechanics of a healthy ovine model and an
   ovine model with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR).
   Methods. Mitral valve size and geometry of both healthy ovine animals
   and those with chronic IMR were used to recreate systolic MV function in
   vitro. A2-P2 coaptation length, coaptation depth, tenting area, anterior
   leaflet strain, and MR were compared between the animal groups and
   valves simulated in the bench-top model.
   Results. For the control conditions, no differences were observed
   between the healthy animals and simulator in coaptation length (p =
   0.681), coaptation depth (p = 0.559), tenting area (p = 0.199), and
   anterior leaflet strain in the radial (p = 0.230) and circumferential (p
   = 0.364) directions. For the chronic IMR conditions, no differences were
   observed between the models in coaptation length (p = 0.596), coaptation
   depth (p = 0.621), tenting area (p = 0.879), and anterior leaflet strain
   in the radial (p = 0.151) and circumferential (p = 0.586) directions. MR
   was similar between IMR models, with an asymmetrical jet originating
   from the tethered A3-P3 leaflets.
   Conclusions. This study is the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   an in vitro simulator to emulate the systolic valvular function and
   mechanics of a healthy ovine model and one with chronic IMR. The in
   vitro IMR model provides the capability to recreate intermediary and
   exacerbated levels of annular and subvalvular distortion for which IMR
   repairs can be simulated. This system provides a realistic and
   controllable test platform for the development and evaluation of current
   and future IMR repairs. (Ann Thorac Surg 2013;95:825-30) (C) 2013 by The

Title = {{Retention and permeability properties of damaged porous rocks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{272-282}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this research work is to model the influence of
   deformation and damage on the permeability and retention properties of
   cracked porous media. This is achieved thanks to the introduction of
   microscale information into a macroscopic damage model. To this end, the
   Pore Size Distribution (PSD) of the material is coupled to the
   mechanical behaviour of the rock. Changes to this distribution due to
   deformation and damage are modelled and then used to capture induced
   changes to the retention and permeability properties of partially
   saturated materials.
   Rock microstructure is characterized by the size distributions of
   natural pores and cracks, which are used to update intrinsic
   permeability with Hagen-Poiseuille flow equation and Darcy's law. The
   void space occupied by water is computed by integrating the pore size
   distributions of natural pores and cracks up to the capillary pore
   radius (r(sat)). Laplace equation is used to relate r(sat) to the
   capillary pressure.
   The paper explains how to update PSD parameters with the macroscopic
   variables (such as deformation and damage), and then how to update
   permeability and retention properties with the PSD parameters.
   Conventional triaxial compression tests are simulated under controlled
   capillary pressure and under controlled water content. The proposed
   model captures well the intrinsic permeability decrease associated to
   the elastic compression of the natural pores, followed by the
   permeability jump due to crack opening. The modeling framework can be
   adapted to any rock constitutive model, including
   thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical couplings. Applications may be found in
   energy production, ore exploitation and waste management. (c) 2012

   determine failure mechanisms. SEM shows that, as temperature increased
   from room temperature to 649 degrees C, the fracture mechanism
   transitions from transgranular to intergranular. The fracture mechanism
   is shown to transition from intergranular to transgranular at elevated
   temperatures as da/dN increases as a result of growing K. Scanning

Abstract = {{The use of tower cranes can cause critical accidents during large
   building construction projects. Failure of the tower crane results in
   critical injuries to crane operators and other workers at the
   construction site. Issues that often cause the fatal collapse of tower
   cranes include the damage and fracture of the mast (or tower) and
   turntable parts, and the tower crane slewing-unit-support fleeing.
   Without systematic investigations and proper prevention procedures in
   place, this type of crane accident, which often leads to worker
   fatalities, will continue to occur. Therefore, more proactive,
   specialized and systematic research needs to be performed in terms of
   forensic engineering to minimize the occurrence of similar disasters. In
   this research, the tower crane collapse accidents are thoroughly
   investigated and the exact cause of the damaged crane parts is also
   identified using fractography and mechanical/chemical characterizations
   techniques, including visual inspections, field research, scanning
   electron microscopes and optical microscopes. Specifically, instrumented
   indentation technique is employed to evaluate the material properties,
   and energy spectrum analysis is used to determine the chemical
   characteristics. Based on thorough investigations, it has been
   identified that the connecting bolts of the tower crane are very
   vulnerable. It is recommended to improve the reliability of the bolts
   and to implement additional regulations to check their maintenance and
   safety. This research clearly provides guidance for investigating crane
   collapse accidents and contributes to the prevention of similar types of
   accidents. Several corrective actions and recommendations are suggested
   to reduce the risk of the tower crane failures.}},

Abstract = {{Thin liquid films can provide efficient means for heat and mass transfer
   by supporting a large rate of evaporation, while maintaining
   temperatures under saturation conditions. The use of nanoporous
   membranes establishes thin liquid films minimizing the possibility of
   dryout by exploiting capillary confinement of the fluid. In combination
   with gas jet impingement, this yields record high heat and mass fluxes.
   Consequently, for applications relying on efficient heat and mass
   transfer, such as, phase change cooling of electronics and membrane
   distillation of water, it is essential to identify and characterize all
   the underlying transport mechanisms affecting overall performance. A
   detailed computational analysis of heat and mass transfer is therefore
   carried out to predict the performance of thin film evaporation. Heat
   conduction and convection are both found crucial in determining the
   temperature distribution within the thin film region, which ultimately
   controls the rate of evaporation from the liquid-vapor interface.
   Furthermore, the effect of vapor transport from the liquid-vapor
   interface on overall performance is also assessed. The relative effects
   of these performance-governing parameters are discussed and
   quantitatively compared at different operating conditions. The results
   of the computational analysis are supported by comparison with
   experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In search of next-generation solar cells, silicon nanowire arrays have
   attracted great attention since they are cost-effective and may absorb
   more light compared to current thin-film silicon solar cells.
   Theoretical studies using finite-difference time-domain and transfer
   matrix methods have been performed to investigate the optical properties
   of silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays. However, these methods are
   computationally intensive and require periodic conditions, which may not
   be satisfied with most fabricated samples. In the present study, an
   effective medium analysis considering the anisotropic nature of
   vertically aligned SiNWs is performed to study their optical properties
   in the wavelength range from 310 nm to 1100 nm, which is of the most
   importance for solar photovoltaic cells. The effective dielectric
   functions of the SiNW layer for both ordinary and extraordinary waves
   are obtained from the Bruggeman approximation. Thin-film optics formulae
   incorporating the anisotropic wave propagation in uniaxial media are
   employed to calculate the reflectance and absorptance of the SiNWs on
   silicon substrates for different polarizations. The effect of geometric
   parameters such as filling ratio and wire length is investigated. In
   addition to modeling the directional radiative properties at various
   angles of incidence, the hemispherical properties are also calculated to
   understand the light absorption and to facilitate the optimal design of
   high-performance SiNW solar cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{A nontoxic heat-sensitive gel containing 1.5 \% (w/v) agar and 25 \%
   (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) was fabricated in this study. Optical
   density measurements with 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser indicated
   that, in spite of its BSA content, the current agar + BSA gel remained
   similar to agar only gel in terms of its optical response to NIR laser.
   The thermal response of the current agar + BSA gel to high temperatures
   was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). According to the
   MRI measurements of T2 relaxation rate as a function of heating
   temperature, the current agar + BSA gel showed a linear response to
   heating temperatures between 65 and 80 A degrees C, while it remained
   thermally stable at temperatures up to 80 A degrees C. Therefore, the
   current agar + BSA gel can be used as thermal dosimeters or volumetric
   heat-sensitive gel phantoms in typical thermal therapy regime.}},

Abstract = {{Early thermal damage in 2205 duplex stainless steel which is caused by
   the precipitation of second phases during a short term exposure to high
   temperature (700 C) is investigated. Nonlinear ultrasonic measurements
   are performed and their results are compared with those from ultrasonic
   velocity and attenuation measurements. Experimental results show that
   the measured acoustic nonlinearity parameter is more sensitive than the
   ultrasonic longitudinal velocity and attenuation to the precipitation of
   chi and sigma phases early in the aging treatments. The results from the
   nonlinear ultrasonic measurements are also supported with those from the
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Rockwell C hardness and Charpy
   impact test. Especially notable is the close correlation between the
   hardness and the nonlinearity parameter. This research therefore
   proposes the nonlinear ultrasonic method as a nondestructive assessment

Abstract = {{This paper presents the follow-up in the development of occupant
   responsive optimal control for double-skin systems that was published
   previously in Park et al. {[}1]. The presented occupant responsive
   optimal control optimizes in real-time the performance of the facade in
   terms of energy, visual comfort (average daylight interior illuminance,
   uniformity, average window luminance, and outward visibility) and
   thermal comfort (Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied, PPD). In the
   aforementioned approach, the double-skin facade system was viewed as an
   `isolated' system and hence treated as a local control problem, i.e.,
   based purely on information about the state of the facade and its
   immediate environment. The paper extends the local control problem to an
   integrated control problem in which room environmental control and
   facade control are dealt with simultaneously. It was found that the
   local control leads to sub-optimality, albeit of moderate proportions.

Abstract = {{For a broad-topic and ambiguous query, different users may have
   different search goals when they submit it to a search engine. The
   inference and analysis of user search goals can be very useful in

   propose a novel approach to infer user search goals by analyzing search
   engine query logs. First, we propose a framework to discover different
   user search goals for a query by clustering the proposed feedback
   sessions. Feedback sessions are constructed from user click-through logs
   and can efficiently reflect the information needs of users. Second, we
   propose a novel approach to generate pseudo-documents to better
   represent the feedback sessions for clustering. Finally, we propose a
   new criterion ``Classified Average Precision (CAP){''} to evaluate the
   performance of inferring user search goals. Experimental results are
   presented using user click-through logs from a commercial search engine
   to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports three-dimensional (3-D) microfabricated toroidal
   inductors intended for power electronics applications. A key fabrication
   advance is the exploitation of thick metal encapsulation of polymer
   pillars to form a vertical via interconnections. The radial conductors
   of the toroidal inductor are formed by conventional plating-through-mold
   techniques, while the vertical windings (up to 650 mu m in height) are
   formed by polymer cores with metal plated on their external surfaces.
   This encapsulated polymer approach not only significantly reduces the
   required plating time but also exploits the relative ease of fabricating
   high-aspect-ratio SU-8 pillars. To form the top radial conductors,
   non-photopatternable SU-8 is introduced as a thick sacrificial layer.
   Two toroidal inductor geometries were fabricated and tested. The first
   inductor had an inner diameter of 2 mm, an outer diameter of 6 mm, 25
   turns and a vertical via height of 650 mu m. The second inductor had an
   inner diameter of 4 mm, an outer diameter of 8 mm, 50 turns and a
   vertical via height of 650 mu m. Both inductor geometries were
   successfully fabricated and characterized in the frequency range of
   0.1-100 MHz. Characterization results of the 25- and 50-turn inductors
   showed an average inductance of 76 and 200 nH, a low frequency (0.1 MHz)
   resistance of 0.2 and 1 Omega and a quality factor of 35 and 24 at 100
   MHz, respectively. Finite-element simulations of the inductors were
   performed and agreed with the measured results to within 8\%. The
   turn-to-turn breakdown voltage was measured to be in excess of 800 V and
   currents as high as 0.5 A could be successfully carried by the inductor
   windings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combined numerical and experimental study on the
   diffuse ultrasonic measurement technique for determining the depth of
   surface breaking cracks in concrete. A finite element (FE) model for the
   dissipative diffusion in a two-dimensional domain with a surface
   breaking crack is developed using a commercial FE package; for this
   purpose, the dissipation term is eliminated by a simple change of
   variables. Three concrete blocks with a crack depth between 25.4 mm to
   101.6 mm are prepared. Diffuse ultrasonic measurements are performed on
   uncracked and cracked concrete blocks, from which the diffuse energy
   evolution curves are obtained. The basic material parameters of the
   hardened concrete, i.e. the diffusivity and dissipation, are retrieved,
   which are needed for the numerical simulations. The crack depths are
   then determined by comparing the experimental and numerical arrival
   times of the average diffuse ultrasonic energy. Various geometrical
   configurations that arise in real-world concrete structures are
   simulated including an inclined crack, a partially closed crack, two
   parallel cracks, and a crack with an underlying reinforcement bar. The
   objective is to investigate the possible limitations of the diffuse
   ultrasonic measurement technique when implemented in real concrete
   structures. Finally, it is shown that the time of flight (TOF) of the
   average diffuse ultrasonic energy constitutes the theoretical basis of
   the present diffuse ultrasonic measurement of macroscopic cracks and
   therefore the present diffuse ultrasonic method forms another kind of
   TOF technique.}},

Title = {{Simulating hemodynamics of the Fontan Y-graft based on patient-specific

Volume = {{145}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Using a bifurcated Y-graft as the Fontan baffle is
   hypothesized to streamline and improve flow dynamics through the total
   cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). This study conducted numerical
   simulations to evaluate this hypothesis using postoperative data from 5
   patients.
   Methods: Patients were imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance or
   computed tomography after receiving a bifurcated aorto-iliac Y-graft as
   their Fontan conduit. Numerical simulations were performed using in vivo
   flow rates, as well as 2 levels of simulated exercise. Two TCPC models
   were virtually created for each patient to serve as the basis for
   hemodynamic comparison. Comparative metrics included connection flow
   resistance and inferior vena caval flow distribution.
   Results: Results demonstrate good hemodynamic outcomes for the Y-graft
   options. The consistency of inferior vena caval flow distribution was
   improved over TCPC controls, whereas the connection resistances were
   generally no different from the TCPC values, except for 1 case in which
   there was a marked improvement under both resting and exercise
   conditions. Examination of the connection hemodynamics as they relate to
   surgical Y-graft implementation identified critical strategies and
   modifications that are needed to potentially realize the theoretical
   efficiency of such bifurcated connection designs.
   Conclusions: Five consecutive patients received a Y-graft connection to
   complete their Fontan procedure with positive hemodynamic results.
   Refining the surgical technique for implementation should result in
   further energetic improvements that may help improve long-term outcomes.

Abstract = {{A newly developed nondestructive evaluation technique, Nonlinear Impact
   Resonance Acoustic Spectroscopy (NIRAS), is applied to concrete
   specimens in an ongoing assessment of aggregate alkali reactivity during
   standard concrete prism testing. NIRAS measures the nonlinearity in a
   specimen caused by the inception and growth of microcracks throughout
   the sample and debonding at the aggregate/cement interface. NIRAS is
   used to exploit the nonlinear effect of excitation amplitude dependent
   resonance frequency changes, which are related to nonlinearity
   measurements of concrete samples cast with aggregates of varying
   reactivity. To relate microstructural changes to changes in nonlinearity
   and expansion, sample characterization is performed with uranyl-acetate
   staining. The results demonstrate the utility of NIRAS for not only
   assessing the potential for ASR under standardized test conditions, but
   for more general damage characterization in concrete and assessment of
   ``job mixtures.{''} NIRAS can distinguish reactive from nonreactive
   aggregates without ambiguity, as supported by sample characterization
   results.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive study is made to analyze the impact of pure lanthanum on
   the microstructure and mechanical properties of Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys at
   high temperatures. Different compositions are tested; the temperature
   applied for the isothermal aging is 150A degrees C, and aging times of
   10 h, 25 h, 50 h, 100 h, and 200 h are studied. Optical microscopy with
   cross-polarized light is used to follow the grain size, which is refined
   from 8 mm to 1 mm for as-cast samples and is maintained during thermal
   aging. Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) present inside the bulk Sn matrix
   affect the mechanical properties of the SAC alloys. Due to
   high-temperature exposure, these IMCs grow and hence their impact on
   mechanical properties becomes more significant. This growth is followed
   by scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy is
   used for elemental mapping of each phase. A significant refinement in
   the average size of IMCs of up to 40\% is identified for the as-cast
   samples, and the coarsening rate of these IMCs is slowed by up to 70\%
   with no change in the interparticle spacing. Yield stress and tensile
   strength are determined through tensile testing at 20A degrees C for
   as-cast samples and after thermal aging at 150A degrees C for 100 h and
   200 h. Both yield stress and tensile strength are increased by up to
   20\% by minute lanthanum doping.}},

Abstract = {{A star graph is a tree of diameter at most two. A star forest is a graph
   that consists of node-disjoint star graphs. In the spanning star forest
   problem, given an unweighted graph G, the objective is to find a star
   forest that contains all vertices of G and has the maximum number of
   edges. This problem is the complement of the dominating set problem in
   the following sense: On a graph with n vertices, the size of the maximum
   spanning star forest is equal to n minus the size of the minimum
   dominating set.
   We present a 0.71-approximation algorithm for this problem, improving
   upon the approximation factor of 0.6 of Nguyen et al. (SIAM J. Comput.
   38:946-962, 2008). We also present a 0.64-approximation algorithm for
   the problem on node-weighted graphs. Finally, we present improved
   hardness of approximation results for the weighted (both edge-weighted
   and node-weighted) versions of the problem.
   Our algorithms use a non-linear rounding scheme, which might be of
   independent interest.}},

Abstract = {{Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the cranial sutures early in
   development. If left untreated, craniosynostosis can lead to
   complications resulting from cranial deformities or increased
   intracranial pressure. The standard treatment involves calvarial
   reconstruction, which in many cases undergoes rapid re-synostosis. This
   requires additional surgical intervention that is associated with a high
   incidence of life threatening complications. To better understand this
   rapid healing, a pediatric mouse model of re-synostosis was developed
   and characterized. Defects (1.5 mm by 2.5 mm) over the posterior frontal
   suture were created surgically in weanling (21 days post-natal) and
   adolescent (50 days post-natal) C57BI/6J mice. In addition, defects were
   created in the frontal bone lateral to the posterior frontal suture. The
   regeneration of bone in the defect was assessed using advanced image
   processing algorithms on micro-computed tomography scans. The genes
   associated with defect healing were assessed by real-time PCR of mRNA
   isolated from the tissue present in the defect. The results showed that
   the weanling mouse healed in a biphasic process with bone bridging the
   defect by post-operative (post-op) day 3 followed by an increase in the
   bone volume on day 14. In adolescent mice, there was a delay in bone
   bridging across the defect, and no subsequent increase in bone volume.
   No bridging of the defect by 14 days post-op was seen in identically
   sized defects placed lateral to the suture in both weanling and
   adolescent animals. This study demonstrates that bone regeneration in
   the cranium is both age and location dependent. Rapid and robust bone
   regeneration only occurred when the defect was created over the
   posterior frontal suture in immature weanling mice. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We study the adhesion of thin films on rigid substrates in the presence
   of spatial heterogeneities. While adhesion is relatively well-understood
   in the context of homogeneous systems, much remains open concerning the
   adhesion of heterogeneous systems. In this paper, we focus on thin
   adhesive tape with heterogeneities in the elastic stiffness, and show
   that these heterogeneities have a profound effect on adhesion raising
   the effective force required to peel the film by an order of magnitude
   with no modification of the actual adhesive interface. We show through
   theory and experiment that this apparent increase is caused by
   fluctuations in the elastic bending energy. We also show that
   heterogeneities can be used to create asymmetry in that the force
   required to peel the tape in one direction can be different from that in
   the other. In short, this work shows that fluctuations in a small
   component of the overall energy of the system can give rise to a
   significant macroscopic consequence. We comment on the broader
   implications of this observation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Optimal design for tuned mass dampers (TMDs) with linear or nonlinear
   viscous damping is formulated in order for design practitioners to
   directly compute the optimal parameters of a TMD in a damped structure
   subjected to wind excitations. The optimal TMD tuning frequency ratio
   and damping coefficient for a viscous TMD system installed in a damped
   structure under 10 white noise excitations are determined by using the
   time-domain optimization procedure, which minimizes the structural
   response. By applying a sequence of curve-fitting schemes to the
   obtained optimal values, design formulas for optimal TMDs are then
   derived. These are expressed as a function of the mass ratio and damping
   power-law exponent of the TMD as well as the damping ratio of the
   structure. The feasibility of the proposed optimal design formulas is
   verified in terms of formulary accuracy and of comparisons with existing
   formulas from previous research works. In addition, one numerical
   example of the Taipei 101 building with a nonlinear TMD, which is
   redesigned according to the proposed optimal formulas, is illustrated in
   effort to describe the use of the formulas in the TMD design procedure
   and to investigate the effectiveness of the optimal TMD. The results
   indicate that the proposed optimal design formulas provide a convenient
   and effective approach for designing a viscous TMD installed in a
   wind-excited damped structure. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Human spaceflight experience in extra-vehicular activity (EVA) is
   limited to two regimes: the micro-gravity environment of Earth orbit,
   and the lunar surface environment at one-sixth of Earth's gravity.
   Future human missions to low-gravity bodies, including asteroids,
   comets, and the moons of Mars, will require EVA techniques that are
   beyond the current experience base. In order to develop robust
   approaches for exploring these small bodies, the dynamics associated
   with human exploration on low-gravity surface must be characterized.
   This paper examines the translational and rotational motion of an
   astronaut on the surface of a small body, and it is shown that the
   low-gravity environment will pose challenges to the surface mobility of
   an astronaut, unless new tools and EVA techniques are developed.
   Possibilities for addressing these challenges are explored, and
   utilization of the International Space Station to test operational
   concepts and hardware in preparation for a low-gravity surface EVA is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality is an important factor for health and safety issues
   associated with public health and also for aquatic life. More and more
   water quality issues are becoming a significant concern due to the
   growth of population, urban expansion and development. Thus, assessment
   of surface water quality has become an important issue. Water Quality
   Index (WQI) is a single number which can be calculated easily and used
   for overall description of the quality of water bodies used for
   different purposes. In this study, the water quality data obtained from
   10 sampling stations during one year monitoring period at Kirmir basin
   was evaluated. Kirmir basin is one of the important drinking water
   sources of the capital city of Turkey, Ankara. The analyses of 44 water
   quality parameters were done for all water samples at the General
   Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI), Department of Chemistry,
   Water Analysis Laboratory. It was found that DO, BOD, phosphate, color,
   turbidity, T. coli, E. coli, Enterococci, iron, manganese, arsenic,
   aluminum, boron, and barium values which exceed the limit values given
   in the water quality standards are the major pollutants that affect the
   water quality in this basin. For easy interpretation of the data, five
   different WQI models were applied for the selected parameters. The
   suitability of these WQI models is discussed with respect to their
   applicability in similar studies. For this study it is concluded that
   the Canadian WQI (CWQI) and Oregon WQI (OWQI) would provide the best
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Cell microencapsulation has been utilized for decades as a means to
   shield cells from the external environment while simultaneously
   permitting transport of oxygen, nutrients, and secretory molecules. In
   designing cell therapies, donor primary cells are often difficult to
   obtain and expand to appropriate numbers, rendering stem cells an
   attractive alternative due to their capacities for self-renewal,
   differentiation, and trophic factor secretion. Microencapsulation of
   stem cells offers several benefits, namely the creation of a defined
   microenvironment which can be designed to modulate stem cell phenotype,
   protection from hydrodynamic forces and prevention of agglomeration
   during expansion in suspension bioreactors, and a means to transplant
   cells behind a semi-permeable barrier, allowing for molecular secretion
   while avoiding immune reaction. This review will provide an overview of
   relevant microencapsulation processes and characterization in the
   context of maintaining stem cell potency, directing differentiation,
   investigating scalable production methods, and transplanting stem cells
   for clinically relevant disorders. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110:

Abstract = {{Dilute acid as well as water only (hydrothermal) pretreatments often
   lead to a significant hemicellulose loss to soluble furans and insoluble
   degradation products, collectively termed as chars and/or pseudo-lignin.
   In order to understand the factors contributing to reducing sugar yields
   from pretreated biomass and the possible influence of hemicellulose
   derived pseudo-lignin on cellulose conversion at the moderate to low
   enzyme loadings necessary for favorable economics, dilute acid
   pretreatment of Avicel cellulose alone and mixed with beechwood xylan or
   xylose was performed at various severities. Following pretreatment, the
   solids were enzymatically hydrolyzed and characterized for chemical
   composition and physical properties by NMR, FT-IR, and SEM imaging. It
   was found that hemicelluloses (xylan) derived-pseudo-lignin was formed
   at even moderate severities and that these insoluble degradation
   products can significantly retard cellulose hydrolysis. Furthermore,
   although low severity (CSF approximate to 1.94) dilute acid pretreatment
   of a xylanAvicel mixture hydrolyzed most of the xylan (98\%) and
   produced negligible amounts of pseudo-lignin, enzymatic conversion of
   cellulose dropped significantly (>25\%) compared to cellulose pretreated
   alone at the same conditions. The drop in cellulose conversion was
   higher than realized for cellulase inhibition by xylooligomers reported
   previously. Plausible mechanisms are discussed to explain the observed
   reductions in cellulose conversions. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110:

Title = {{The experimental measurement of effective compressive modulus of carbon
   nanotube forests and the nature of deformation}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},

Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{237-244}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Measurement of the effective compressive modulus of vertically aligned
   carbon nanotube (CNT) forests/turfs is evaluated with two different
   experimental methods. The first experimental method uses a high force
   nanoindentation system to uniformly compress CNT forests grown on rigid
   silicon substrates with a second silicon substrate on the top surface of
   the CNTs. This is performed for CNTs with heights of 61, 315, and 683 mu
   m. Using this nanoindentation-based method, the measured effective
   compressive modulus values ranged from 0.12 to 1.2 MPa. Additionally,
   the effect of end constraints is investigated by testing the CNT forests
   with and without attaching the second rigid substrate to the CNT forest
   tips with an adhesive. It was found that attaching the second substrate
   to the CNT tips with an adhesive increases the measured effective
   compressive modulus by 10-30\%. The second experimental method in this
   study is semi in situ and uses a scanning electron microscope and a
   compressive fixture with load cell. This method shows that under uniform
   compressive loading, the CNT forests demonstrate a local folding form of
   deformation with initial folding occurring near the growth substrate.
   The effective compressive modulus measured using this method was 0.11
   MPa for 133 mu m tall CNT forests. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Functionalization of carbon surface leads to the enhancement of ion
   storage capacity of carbon cathodes due to the additional
   pseudocapacitive reactions. In order to gain additional insights on the
   effects of the carbon specific surface area, porosity and
   oxygeni-containing functional groups on their electrochemical
   performance, we have investigated thick (> 150 mu m) electrodes based on
   carbon onion nanopowder with and without functional groups present on
   carbon surface as well as nanodiamond soot and mesoporous activated
   carbon. Oxidation of carbon onion surface was found to result in a
   2.4-2.8-fold increase in their specific capacitance. The larger average
   pore size and the absence of micropores in carbon nanoparticles based
   electrodes resulted in a better rate performance compared to that of
   mesoporous activated carbon. However, significant self-discharge was
   observed in all the oxidized samples. The low electrode density combined
   with limited overall charge storage capacity of carbon samples resulted
   in a volumetric capacity of less than 23 mAh cm(-3), compared to 450-700
   mAh cm(-3) offered by state of the art high-density cathodes used in
   commercial Li-ion batteries. Even with further improvements, our
   estimations suggest that porous carbon cathodes will unlikely be able to
   offer more than 15\% of the energy density of traditional cathodes. (c)

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use of
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) for speech applications, and it seems
   that a new trend to move the speech technology forward has begun. Two
   main contributions have triggered such a new trend: 1) a major advance
   has been made in training the weights in deep neural networks (DNNs),
   and a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM)
   hybrid architecture has outperformed a conventional Gaussian mixture
   model hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) automatic speech recognition (ASR)
   system on a challenging business search dataset, and 2) it has been
   shown that phoneme classification can be boosted by using a hierarchical
   structure of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) trained to model long-span
   temporal patterns with beneficial effects on language recognition tasks.
   In this work, we combine these two lines of research and demonstrate
   that word recognition accuracy can be significantly enhanced by
   arranging DNNs in a hierarchical structure to model long-term energy
   trajectories. The proposed solution has been evaluated on the 5000-word
   Wall Street Journal task, resulting in consistent and significant
   improvements in both phone and word recognition accuracy rates. We have
   also analyzed the effects of various modeling choices on the system
   performance, and several architectural solutions have been compared.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of the permeability of microcapsules with Fluorescence
   Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) enables analysis of individual

   which expands the parameter space of microcapsule sizes and
   permeabilities that can be accurately measured with FRAP. Simulations
   and experiments show that the hybrid analysis, which accounts for both
   permeation through the shell and free diffusion, precisely captures the
   kinetics of typical fluorescence recovery curves. The modified approach
   eliminates the need for painstaking controls to determine the FRAP
   measurement volume and the spatial distribution of bleached tracers,
   while accurately extracting the permeability of the microcapsule from
   FRAP data acquired using a straightforward procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Several experimental studies have shown that fatigue cracks in Ni-based
   superalloys preferentially form in the vicinity of favorably oriented
   annealing twin boundaries. However, this increase in the probability of
   crack nucleation has not been quantified in detail since 3 material
   modeling has not typically considered twins. The present work employs
   finite element simulations and a continuum crystal plasticity
   constitutive model for RR1000 Ni-based superalloy to assess the
   potential enhancement of nonlocal fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs)
   incurred by the presence of I 3 pound twins. Two cases are analyzed:
   single crystals with twins of different widths subjected to single slip
   cyclic shear deformation aligned with the twin plane and polycrystals
   with 20 \% of the grains half-twinned. Simulations with and without
   twins are compared in both cases. The results demonstrate the
   detrimental effect of twins in shifting the upper tail of the FIP
   distribution to higher values; this shift is more pronounced with an
   increase of twin thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Tandem queues constitute a fundamental structure of queueing networks.
   However, exact queue times in tandem queues are notoriously difficult to
   compute except for some special cases. Several approximation schemes
   that are based on mathematical assumptions that enable approximate
   analyses of tandem queues have been reported in the literature. This
   article proposes an approximation approach that is based on observed
   properties of the behavior of tandem queues: the intrinsic gap and
   intrinsic ratio. The approach exploits the nearly linear and
   heavy-traffic properties of the intrinsic ratio, which appear to hold in
   realistic production situations. The proposed approach outperforms
   existing approximation methods across a broad range of examined cases.
   It is also demonstrated that the proposed approach has the potential
   when applied to historical data to achieve accurate mean queue time
   estimates in practical production environments. {[}Supplemental

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational approach for creating an operational
   schedule for the tactical load plan used by a less-than-truckload (LTL)
   motor carrier. A load plan determines how freight is routed through an
   LTL carrier's linehaul terminal network by specifying a sequence of
   transfer terminals for all freight shipments, but does not provide a
   timed schedule of trailer, tractor, and driver dispatches required to
   operate the plan. Developing a detailed operational schedule allows one
   to more accurately estimate the likely cost of a given load plan, along
   with other important performance metrics. Given a load plan, the
   scheduling approach we develop creates loaded truck dispatches between
   terminals with specified time windows, and then creates cyclic driver
   schedules to cover all dispatches. A computational study using data from
   a large U.S. LTL carrier demonstrates that our technology produces
   schedules that accurately model operational costs, typically within 2\%
   of actual reported costs. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Surgical teleoperation systems are being increasingly deployed recently.
   There are, however, some unsolved issues such as nonlinear
   characteristics of the interaction between the slave robot and soft
   tissues and difficulty in employing force sensors in the surgical
   end-effectors of the slave. These issues make it difficult to generalize
   any approach to develop a control for the system. This paper addresses
   these issues by proposing a H-infinity suboptimal controller preserving
   robust stability and performance. The environment, i.e., soft tissues,
   is characterized with the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model. This nonlinear
   characteristics of soft tissues are expressed with an affine combination
   of linear models within a predefined parameter polytope. For this linear
   parameter-varying system, a gain-scheduling control scheme is employed
   to design a suboptimal controller while guaranteeing its stability. To
   avoid using any force measurement in slave, we used position-position
   (PP) control architecture. The developed gain-scheduling control is
   validated with quantitative experimental results. The developed
   gain-scheduling PP control scheme shows good tracking capacity and high
   transparency for varied experimental conditions. Error of the
   transmitted impedance is significantly lower compared with other
   conventional control schemes for frequencies less than 2 Hz, which is
   frequently recommended for surgical teleoperation.}},

   capacitances for five growth times (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min) were
   measured to be 30-79 F g(-1) and compare favorably to similar studies.
   Power densities for all supercapacitor sheets exceeded 3 MW kg(-1) and
   consistently exceeded other VACNT supercapacitor studies. Our study

Title = {{Cysteine (C)-X-C Receptor 4 Undergoes Transportin 1-Dependent Nuclear

Abstract = {{The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), Cysteine (C)-X-C Receptor 4
   (CXCR4), plays an important role in prostate cancer metastasis. CXCR4 is
   generally regarded as a plasma membrane receptor where it transmits
   signals that support transformation, progression and eventual
   metastasis. Due to the central role of CXCR4 in tumorigenesis,
   therapeutics approaches such as antagonist and monoclonal antibodies
   have focused on receptors that exist on the plasma membrane. An emerging
   concept for G-protein coupled receptors is that they may localize to and
   associate with the nucleus where they retain function and mediate
   nuclear signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that CXCR4 associated with the
   nucleus of malignant prostate cancer tissues. Likewise, expression of
   CXCR4 was detected in nuclear fractions among several prostate cancer
   cell lines, compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. Our studies
   identified a nuclear pool of CXCR4 and we defined a nuclear transport
   pathway for CXCR4. We reveal a putative nuclear localization sequence
   (NLS), `RPRK', within CXCR4 that contributed to nuclear localization.
   Additionally, nuclear CXCR4 interacted with Transportin beta 1 and
   Transportin beta 1-binding to CXCR4 promoted its nuclear translocation.
   Importantly, G(alpha i) immunoprecipitation and calcium mobilization
   studies indicated that nuclear CXCR4 was functional and participated in
   G-protein signaling, revealing that the nuclear pool of CXCR4 retained
   function. Given the suggestion that functional, nuclear CXCR4 may be a
   mechanism underlying prostate cancer recurrence, increased metastatic
   ability and poorer prognosis after tumors have been treated with therapy
   that targets plasma membrane CXCR4, these studies addresses a novel
   mechanism of nuclear signaling for CXCR4, a novel mechanism of clinical
   targeting, and demonstrate an active nuclear pool that provides
   important new information to illuminate what has been primarily clinical
   reports of nuclear CXCR4.}},

Abstract = {{Alumina (Al2O3) films deposited through atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   are known to be effective permeation barriers due to their uniformity
   and pinhole-free morphology. However, they suffer from process-induced
   defects that inhibit their stability in aqueous and hygroscopic
   environments. We explore the water stability of ALD deposited alumina
   barrier films capped with nickel oxide (NiOx) and titanium oxide (TiOx)
   thin films deposited through e-beam or ALD deposition. The performance
   of the barriers was evaluated by measuring their ability to protect zinc
   oxide (ZnO) thin film sensors immersed in deionized (DI) water. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the composition
   of the barrier films with the various capping layers. The characteristic
   photoluminescence (PL) peak for the ZnO sensor was used as a marker to
   study changes in peak intensity due to degradation of the barrier films
   as a function of water immersion time. The TiOx capped films showed
   remarkable stability when immersed in DI water for 10 days. These
   results show that TiOx capping layers can offer superior protection to
   mitigate the water degradation of ALD alumina barrier films. Such
   composite laminates will enable a wider range of applications for ALD
   deposited alumina barrier films including aqueous environments.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel networking paradigm which allows
   the communication among all sorts of physical objects over the Internet.
   The IoT defines a world-wide cyber-physical system with a plethora of
   applications in the fields of domotics, e-health, goods monitoring and
   logistics, among others. The use of cross-layer communication schemes to
   provide adaptive solutions for the IoT is motivated by the high
   heterogeneity in the hardware capabilities and the communication
   requirements among things. In this paper, a novel cross-layer module for
   the IoT is proposed to accurately capture both the high heterogeneity of
   the IoT and the impact of the Internet as part of the network
   architecture. The fundamental part of the module is a mathematical
   framework, which is developed to obtain the optimal routing paths and
   the communication parameters among things, by exploiting the
   interrelations among different layer functionalities in the IoT.
   Moreover, a cross-layer communication protocol is presented to implement

Title = {{Robust Tract Skeleton Extraction of Cingulum Based on Active Contour
   Model from Diffusion Tensor MR Imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Cingulum is widely studied in healthy and psychiatric subjects. For
   cingulum analysis from diffusion tensor MR imaging, tractography and
   tract of interest method have been adopted for tract-based analysis.
   Because tractography performs fiber tracking according to local
   diffusion measures, they can be sensitive to noise and tracking errors
   can be accumulated along the fiber. For more accurate localization of
   cingulum, we attempt to define it by skeleton extraction using the
   tensors' information throughout the tract of cingulum simultaneously,
   which is quite different from the idea of tractography. In this study,
   we introduce an approach to extract the skeleton of cingulum using
   active contour model, which allows us to optimize the location of
   cingulum in a global sense based on the diffusion measurements along the
   entire tract and contour regularity. Validation of this method on
   synthetic and experimental data proved that our approach is able to
   reduce the influence of noise and partial volume effect, and extract the
   skeleton of cingulum robustly and reliably. Our proposed method provides
   an approach to localize cingulum robustly, which is a very important
   feature for tract-based analysis and can be of important practical
   utility.}},

   Hybrid Materials}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{613-622}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{A new method to prepare hyperbranched polyamine-oxide hybrid materials
   by means of a vapor-phase transport is developed. In this method, hybrid
   materials having hyperbranched amine polymers covalently bound to an
   oxide support are formed by exposing the oxide support to the vapor of
   small nitrogen-containing heterocyclic monomers, in contrast to the
   conventional liquid-phase method, in which the support is dispersed in
   an organic solution containing monomer species. The aziridine and
   azetidine monomers are polymerized on the surface of the oxide supports
   (i.e., silica and alumina), resulting in poly(ethylenimine) or
   poly(propylenimine) chains attached to the porous solid support The
   results suggest that the hybrid materials can be prepared over a wide
   range of preparation conditions with organic contents comparable to or
   even higher than those obtained from the standard liquid phase method.
   It is demonstrated that supports with more acidity result in the hybrid
   materials with higher organic content Interestingly, the resulting
   supported polyamines have lower molecular weights than the previously
   reported materials prepared by the liquid phase method. It is
   anticipated that the vapor phase synthesis can be applied for the
   efficient introduction of polyamines into structural forms of supports
   such as fibers, membranes, and monoliths, for which the liquid-phase
   method may be inappropriate or inefficient.}},

Abstract = {{We present the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of amphiphilic heteroarm
   pH-sensitive star-shaped polystyrene-poly(2-pyridine) (PS(n)P2VP(n))
   block copolymers to fabricate porous and multicompartmental
   microcapsules. Pyridine-containing star molecules forming a hydrophobic
   core/hydrophilic corona unimolecular micelle in acidic solution (pH 3)
   were alternately deposited with oppositely charged linear sulfonated
   polystyrene (PSS), yielding microcapsules with LbL shells containing
   hydrophobic micelles. The surface morphology and internal nanopore
   structure of the hollow microcapsules were comparatively investigated
   for shells formed from star polymers with a different numbers of arms (9
   versus 22) and varied shell thickness (5, 8, and 11 bilayers). The
   successful integration of star unimers into the LbL shells was
   demonstrated by probing their buildup, surface segregation behavior, and
   porosity. The larger arm star copolymer (22 arms) with stretched
   conformation showed a higher increment in shell thickness due to the
   effective ionic complexation whereas a compact, uniform grainy
   morphology was observed regardless of the number of deposition cycles
   and arm numbers. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) revealed that
   microcapsules with hydrophobic domains showed different fractal
   properties depending upon the number of bilayers with a surface fractal
   morphology observed for the thinnest shells and a mass fractal
   morphology for the completed shells formed with the larger number of
   bilayers. Moreover, SANS provides support for the presence of relatively
   large pores (about 25 nm across) for the thinnest shells as suggested
   from permeability experiments. The formation of robust microcapsules
   with nanoporous shells composed of a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte with a
   densely packed hydrophobic core based on star amphiphiles represents an
   intriguing and novel case of compartmentalized microcapsules with an
   ability to simultaneously store different hydrophilic, charged, and
   hydrophobic components within shells.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions of selectins with cell surface glycoconjugates mediate the
   first step of the adhesion and signaling cascade that recruits
   circulating leukocytes to sites of infection or injury. P-selectin
   dimerizes on the surface of endothelial cells and forms dimeric bonds
   with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a homodimeric sialomucin
   on leukocytes. It is not known whether leukocyte L-selectin or
   endothelial cell E-selectin are monomeric or oligomeric. Here we used
   the micropipette technique to analyze two-dimensional binding of
   monomeric or dimeric L- and E-selectin with monomeric or dimeric PSGL-1.
   Adhesion frequency analysis demonstrated that E-selectin on human aortic
   endothelial cells supported dimeric interactions with dimeric PSGL-1 and
   monomeric interactions with monomeric PSGL-1. In contrast, L- selectin
   on human neutrophils supported monomeric interactions with dimeric or

Abstract = {{Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with increased mortality in
   patients undergoing mitral valve repair. In recent decades, TR has been
   addressed using annuloplasty concomitantly with mitral valve repair by
   some surgeons. However, repair efficacy and durability are often
   suboptimal. Increased understanding of tricuspid valve coaptation and
   the effects of pathological and repair conditions may be useful to
   inform future repair design. In the present study, we propose a
   two-dimensional in vitro technique, available coaptation area (ACA), to
   quantify the area of each tricuspid leaflet available for coaptation.
   Preliminary results showed that annular dilatation caused a significant
   (p<0.05) decrease in anterior leaflet ACA (0.92 +/- 0.18 cm(2)), and
   combined annular dilatation and papillary muscle (PM) displacement
   resulted in a significant decrease in posterior leaflet ACA (0.87 +/-
   0.15 cm(2)). Isolated PM displacement did not have a significant effect
   on ACA, and the septal leaflet showed no changed in ACA under the
   conditions tested. In addition to quantifying ACA, our technique allows
   for the detailed mapping of leaflet coaptation, which may be used to
   reveal specific sites of malcoaptation on each leaflet. Application of
   the ACA method in future studies may lead to the development of
   specialized tricuspid repair strategies and annuloplasty ring designs
   that target specific regions of the tricuspid valve based on underlying
   pathological conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional small-signal theory for the backward-wave mode in a
   traveling-wave tube (TWT) is developed, which includes the effects of
   random fabrication errors. This is of interest since the backward-wave
   mode is the spatial harmonic typically responsible for instability in a
   TWT. The described model examines how gain and instantaneous 1-dB
   bandwidth of the backward-wave mode is affected by random fabrication
   errors, which are modeled as random perturbations of the phase velocity,
   interaction impedance, and loss along the TWT's length. Random variation
   of the phase velocity is found to have the largest effect on both the
   backward-wave gain and the bandwidth while having only a minor effect on
   fundamental, forward-wave mode behavior. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Clouds, a key component of the climate system, form when water vapor
   condenses upon atmospheric particulates termed cloud condensation nuclei
   (CCN). Variations in CCN concentrations can profoundly impact cloud
   properties, with important effects on local and global climate. Organic
   matter constitutes a significant fraction of tropospheric aerosol mass,
   and can influence CCN activity by depressing surface tension,
   contributing solute, and influencing droplet activation kinetics by
   forming a barrier to water uptake. We present direct evidence that two
   ubiquitous atmospheric trace gases, methylglyoxal (MG) and acetaldehyde,
   known to be surface-active, can enhance aerosol CCN activity upon
   uptake. This effect is demonstrated by exposing acidified ammonium
   sulfate particles to 250 parts per billion (ppb) or 8 ppb gas-phase MG
   and/or acetaldehyde in an aerosol reaction chamber for up to 5 h. For
   the more atmospherically relevant experiments, i.e., the 8ppb organic
   precursor concentrations, significant enhancements in CCN activity, up
   to 7.5\% reduction in critical dry diameter for activation, are observed
   over a timescale of hours, without any detectable limitation in
   activation kinetics. This reduction in critical diameter enhances the
   apparent particle hygroscopicity up to 26\%, which for ambient aerosol
   would lead to cloud droplet number concentration increases of 8-10\% on
   average. The observed enhancements exceed what would be expected based
   on Kohler theory and bulk properties. Therefore, the effect may be
   attributed to the adsorption of MG and acetaldehyde to the gas-aerosol
   interface, leading to surface tension depression of the aerosol. We
   conclude that gas-phase surfactants may enhance CCN activity in the
   atmosphere.}},

Title = {{Optimization of two- and three-link snakelike locomotion}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{We analyze two- and three-link planar snakelike locomotion and optimize
   the motion for efficiency. The locomoting system consists of two or
   three identical inextensible links connected via hinge joints, and the
   angles between the links are actuated as prescribed periodic functions
   of time. An essential feature of snake locomotion is frictional
   anisotropy: The forward, backward, and transverse coefficients of
   friction differ. The dynamics are studied analytically and numerically
   for small and large amplitudes of the internal angles. Efficiency is
   defined as the ratio between distance traveled and the energy expended
   within one period, i.e., the inverse of the cost of locomotion. The
   optimal set of coefficients of friction to maximize efficiency consists
   of a large backward coefficient of friction and a small transverse
   coefficient of friction, compared to the forward coefficient of
   friction. For the two-link case with a symmetrical motion, efficiency is
   maximized when the internal angle amplitude is approximately pi/2 for a
   sufficiently large transverse coefficient. For the three-link case, the
   efficiency-maximizing paths are triangles in the parameter space of
   internal angles. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.022711}},

Abstract = {{A novel multifunctional drug-delivery platform is developed based on
   cholesteryl succinyl silane (CSS) nanomicelles loaded with doxorubicin,
   Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, and gold nanoshells (CDF-Au-shell
   nanomicelles) to combine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging,
   magnetic-targeted drug delivery, light-triggered drug release, and
   photothermal therapy. The nanomicelles show improved drug-encapsulation
   efficiency and loading level, and a good response to magnetic fields,
   even after the formation of the gold nanoshell. An enhancement for
   T2-weighted MR imaging is observed for the CDF-Au-shell nanomicelles.
   These nanomicelles display surface plasmon absorbance in the
   near-infrared (NIR) region, thus exhibiting an NIR (808 nm)-induced
   temperature elevation and an NIR light-triggered and stepwise release
   behavior of doxorubicin due to the unique characteristics of the CSS
   nanomicelles. Photothermal cytotoxicity in vitro confirms that the
   CDF-Au-shell nanomicelles cause cell death through photothermal effects
   only under NIR laser irradiation. Cancer cells incubated with
   CDF-Au-shell nanomicelles show a significant decrease in cell viability
   only in the presence of both NIR irradiation and a magnetic field, which
   is attributed to the synergetic effects of the magnetic-field-guided
   drug delivery and the photothermal therapy. Therefore, such
   multicomponent nanomicelles can be developed as a smart and promising
   nanosystem that integrates multiple capabilities for effective cancer
   diagnosis and therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The empirical model developed in the present work allows estimation of
   crystal size distributions from focused beam reflectance measurements
   (FBRM) of chord length distributions. The model is constructed from
   purposely varied crystal size distributions and the corresponding
   measured chord length distributions, which allows construction of a
   transformation matrix relating the two distributions. Experimental
   results show advantages over more complex phenomenological models,
   presumably because the transformation matrix implicitly embodies such
   phenomena. The ability of the model to address varying crystal
   concentration and selectively added size fractions is demonstrated with
   experimental results. Finally, the simplicity of the approach allows
   rapid (of order 0.1 s) estimation of crystal size distributions from
   FBRM, which is a promising outcome for potentially using the approach in
   an on-line control scheme. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For increasing separation efficiency and reducing energy consumption,
   study about membrane fouling reduction has ever been a hot topic. To
   prepare fouling-resistant, hydrophilic and conductive membrane,
   polyester filter cloth was modified with polypyrrole (PPy) in-situ
   formed by polymerization of pyrrole (concentration 3.868 g/L) and sodium
   dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). Increase in SDBS concentration (0.5, 1
   or 2 g/L) during polymerization increased the membrane electric
   conductivity and hydrophilicity, and enhanced the permeate flux and
   anti-fouling properties of modified membrane. A voltage drop at 0.2 or
   0.4 V/cm exhibited better fouling reduction than 0 V/cm. In the
   long-term filtration tests with the PPy (2 g/L SDBS) modified membrane,
   both the irreversible and the total resistances were decreased (5 times
   and 2 times, respectively) by applying 0.2 V/cm electric field,
   indicating the effect of applied electric field towards fouling
   reduction. The membrane cathode successfully prevented the pore
   clogging. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.Y. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the charging behavior of polystyrene and polymethyl
   methacrylate particles with different functional surface groups in water
   and in decane containing either ionic (AOT) or nonionic surfactant (Span
   85). Electrophoretic mobilities in the nonpolar media are measured as a
   function of surfactant concentration and the applied electric field
   strength by phase analysis light scattering (PALS); acid-base
   characteristics of the particles and the surfactant are investigated via
   contact angle measurement and interfacial tensiometry, and the residual
   water content of the non-aqueous dispersions is assessed by Karl Fischer
   titration. The results suggest a competition of several mechanisms for
   particle charging in nonpolar media. At high concentrations of the
   nonionic surfactant, particle charging becomes insensitive to the
   functional surface groups responsible for charging in aqueous
   dispersions, but consistent with a charge transfer between the polymer
   surface and the surfactant due to acid-base interactions, which can be
   rationalized in terms of measurable acid-base parameters. By contrast,
   particle charging in nonpolar solutions of the ionic surfactant (with
   significantly larger amounts of residual water) suggests a strong
   influence of surface headgroup ionization, and of dissociated
   surfactants adsorbed to the particle surface. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Adsorption study of CO2, CH4, N-2, and H2O on an interwoven copper

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive microporous materials for
   adsorption separations due to their extraordinary structures and
   impressive high surface areas. Catenation, or framework
   interpenetration, can significantly impact the crystal stability and
   improve the adsorption interactions. This interesting approach was used
   to obtain \{{[}Cu-3(BTB)(2)(H2O)(3)]center dot(DMF)(9)(H2O)(2)] (MOF-14)
   as a microporous material with a high surface area and large pore
   volume, which are desirable parameters for adsorption applications.
   Here, we report a detailed study of this catenated material with its gas
   adsorption properties. The potential for adsorption separations is
   evaluated by measuring pure-component adsorption isotherms for carbon
   dioxide, methane, and nitrogen. The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory
   (IAST) was used to evaluate adsorption selectivities of MOF-14 for
   CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 equimolar mixtures. In addition, water adsorption
   and the impact of exposure on structural degradation are reported.
   Compared to other open-metal site MOFs, MOF-14 adsorbs significantly
   less water. This interwoven MOF is a promising competitor to other MOF
   materials in the gas separation field due to low interactions with water
   and high selectivity for CO2 over N-2. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Partial charges in dense materials can be either derived from

   X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) energies measured for
   several Mo-containing materials were correlated with charges computed by
   two density functional theory (DFT)-based charge assignment methods,
   namely, the Bader and density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC)
   methods. Our results indicated that DDEC charges correlate better with
   XANES energies than Bader charges and that both of these methods give
   far better results than using formal oxidation states. We show that the

   characterizing the degree of reduction in supported catalyst samples.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the adsorption and diffusion of small alcohols in ZIF-8 and
   ZIF-90 with a combined experimental and modeling approach. Our Grand
   Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations predict that both ZIFs exhibit
   a slight adsorption selectivity for ethanol over methanol, in good
   agreement with previous experimental data. The adsorption uptake of the
   alcohols at low pressures is found to be significantly higher in ZIF-90
   than ZIF-8. Our simulations indicate that this is due to hydrogen
   bonding between the alcohols and the carbonyl group of ZIF-90 but that
   this effect is not strong enough to cause appreciable flexibility of the
   ZIF-90 framework during adsorption. We also report alcohol
   self-diffusivities and Arrhenius parameters measured using pulsed field
   gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
   diffusivities measured using PFG-NMR indicate that the diffusion
   selectivity of methanol over ethanol is significantly higher in ZIF-8 (S
   = 229) than in ZIF-90 (S = 6) at T = 25 degrees C. Qualitative agreement
   is obtained between experimental and simulated diffusivities using the
   generalized AMBER (GAFF) force field including framework flexibility.}},

   hotspot size-temperature threshold}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{A criterion for the ignition of granular explosives (GXs) and
   polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under shock and non-shock loading is
   developed. The formulation is based on integration of a quantification
   of the distributions of the sizes and locations of hotspots in loading
   events using a cohesive finite element method (CFEM) developed recently
   and the characterization by Tarver et al. {[}C. M. Tarver et al.,
   ``Critical conditions for impact-and shock-induced hot spots in solid
   explosives,{''} J. Phys. Chem. 100, 5794-5799 (1996)] of the critical
   size-temperature threshold of hotspots required for chemical ignition of
   solid explosives. The criterion, along with the CFEM capability to
   quantify the thermal-mechanical behavior of GXs and PBXs, allows the
   critical impact velocity for ignition, time to ignition, and critical
   input energy at ignition to be determined as functions of material
   composition, microstructure, and loading conditions. The applicability
   of the relation between the critical input energy (E) and impact
   velocity of James {[}H. R. James, ``An extension to the critical energy
   criterion used to predict shock initiation thresholds,{''} Propellants,
   Explos., Pyrotech. 21, 8-13 (1996)] for shock loading is examined,
   leading to a modified interpretation, which is sensitive to
   microstructure and loading condition. As an application, numerical
   studies are undertaken to evaluate the ignition threshold of granular
   high melting point eXplosive,
   octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,2,3,5-tetrazocine (HMX) and HMX/Estane
   PBX under loading with impact velocities up to 350 ms(-1) and strain
   rates up to 10(5) s(-1). Results show that, for the GX, the time to
   criticality (t(c)) is strongly influenced by initial porosity, but is
   insensitive to grain size. Analyses also lead to a quantification of the
   differences between the responses of the GXs and PBXs in terms of
   critical impact velocity for ignition, time to ignition, and critical
   input energy at ignition. Since the framework permits explicit tracking
   of the influences of microstructure, loading, and mechanical
   constraints, the calculations also show the effects of stress wave
   reflection and confinement condition on the ignition behaviors of GXs
   and PBXs. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The composition and prevalence of microorganisms in the middle-to-upper
   troposphere (8-15 km altitude) and their role in
   aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions represent important, unresolved
   questions for biological and atmospheric science. In particular,
   airborne microorganisms above the oceans remain essentially
   uncharacterized, as most work to date is restricted to samples taken
   near the Earth's surface. Here we report on the microbiome of low-and
   high-altitude air masses sampled onboard the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration DC-8 platform during the 2010 Genesis and Rapid
   Intensification Processes campaign in the Caribbean Sea. The samples
   were collected in cloudy and cloud-free air masses before, during, and
   after two major tropical hurricanes, Earl and Karl. Quantitative PCR and
   microscopy revealed that viable bacterial cells represented on average
   around 20\% of the total particles in the 0.25- to 1-mu m diameter range
   and were at least an order of magnitude more abundant than fungal cells,
   suggesting that bacteria represent an important and underestimated
   fraction of micrometer-sized atmospheric aerosols. The samples from the
   two hurricanes were characterized by significantly different bacterial
   communities, revealing that hurricanes aerosolize a large amount of new
   cells. Nonetheless, 17 bacterial taxa, including taxa that are known to
   use C1-C4 carbon compounds present in the atmosphere, were found in all
   samples, indicating that these organisms possess traits that allow
   survival in the troposphere. The findings presented here suggest that
   the microbiome is a dynamic and underappreciated aspect of the upper
   troposphere with potentially important impacts on the hydrological
   cycle, clouds, and climate.}},

Abstract = {{Root system growth and development is highly plastic and is influenced
   by the surrounding environment. Roots frequently grow in heterogeneous
   environments that include interactions from neighboring plants and
   physical impediments in the rhizosphere. To investigate how planting
   density and physical objects affect root system growth, we grew rice in
   a transparent gel system in close proximity with another plant or a
   physical object. Root systems were imaged and reconstructed in three
   dimensions. Root-root interaction strength was calculated using
   quantitative metrics that characterize the extent to which the
   reconstructed root systems overlap each other. Surprisingly, we found
   the overlap of root systems of the same genotype was significantly
   higher than that of root systems of different genotypes. Root systems of
   the same genotype tended to grow toward each other but those of
   different genotypes appeared to avoid each other. Shoot separation
   experiments excluded the possibility of aerial interactions, suggesting
   root communication. Staggered plantings indicated that interactions
   likely occur at root tips in close proximity. Recognition of obstacles
   also occurred through root tips, but through physical contact in a
   size-dependent manner. These results indicate that root systems use two
   different forms of communication to recognize objects and alter root
   architecture: root-root recognition, possibly mediated through root
   exudates, and root-object recognition mediated by physical contact at
   the root tips. This finding suggests that root tips act as local sensors
   that integrate rhizosphere information into global root architectural
   changes.}},
