Abstract = {{What's known as the second disaster, a result of unsolicited in-kind
   donations, has been a long-standing problem in disaster relief. Over the
   years, NGOs have tried to convince donors to contribute only cash in an
   effort to reduce the impact of this issue. The ``cash only{''} approach,
   however, has not been fully successful and the burden of unsolicited
   donations continues to cripple NGO relief operations in all major
   disasters. Although cash giving is most convenient for NGOs, it does not
   have the same emotional appeal for donors. In-kind donations are more
   tangible, specific, and often the most economical way to give. Yet
   because there is no formal mechanism to ensure they are appropriate and
   productive, unsolicited in-kind donations pose a challenge in disaster
   response. By establishing an on - line donation registry with national
   retailers, NGOs can solicit targeted in-kind donations for disaster
   relief in a timely fashion. During the Superstorm Sandy response in
   2012, a group in New York proved this concept can work by repurposing
   Amazon's wedding registry to solicit relief supplies. They were able to
   collect over 35,000 needed items through the registry in the first few
   weeks after the storm. This paper reviews the forces that lead to the
   second disaster, describes a successful implementation of the on-line
   registry as part of the Superstorm Sandy response, compares the registry
   with a donation portal such as the Aidmatrix national donation portal
   and discusses the challenges and opportunities for implementing a
   registry on a national scale.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of a manned cislunar way point base at the moon are
   driving the need to rapidly compute low-energy, low thrust (le-lt)
   trajectories to Earth Moon L1/L2 Lagrange points. Existing methods are
   hard to setup and suffer from large compute times. We propose LOTUS a
   robust, near-optimal solver, capable of rapidly computing near optimal
   le-lt trajectories. The algorithm takes advantage of a low thrust
   feedback control law (Q-Law) along with a novel, heuristic based le-lt
   patch point selection strategy implemented via a backward solution
   methodology. LOTUS is applied to a solar electric propulsion powered,
   Earth-Moon L2 transfer design problem. On the order of 700, near optimal
   le-lt transfers solutions are computed in similar to 3.5 hrs.}},

Abstract = {{On August 5, 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft landed the
   heaviest payload on Mars using the largest aeroshell and supersonic
   parachute ever used by a planetary entry mission. Moreover, an
   innovative Sky Crane landing system was utilized to softly and
   accurately place the science payload on the ground near the desired
   target. The spacecraft recorded inertial measurement unit data and radar
   altimeter measurements during its descent through the Martian atmosphere
   and the aeroshell was also instrumented with flush atmospheric data
   system sensors that allow for the reconstruction of the vehicle's
   pressure distribution and freestream atmospheric conditions. This paper
   shows the preliminary results of the vehicle's trajectory and atmosphere
   reconstruction using a statistical estimation methodology that utilizes
   an extended Kalman filter. This method has been demonstrated with
   simulated Mars entry data in the past, and has the capability of
   simultaneously estimating the parameters and their uncertainties using
   the initial state covariance and measurement uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{With a goal of efficiently trading higher memory footprints for faster
   runtimes, a high fidelity interpolation method is presented for
   approximating a scalar quantity and associated gradients in the global
   3D domain external to a sphere. The new ``Fetch{''} interpolation model
   utilizes the weighting function method originally proposed by Junkins
   et. al to achieve continuity and smoothness. An overlapping grid
   strategy ensures a singularity-free domain, while minimizing associated
   memory costs. Local interpolating functions are judiciously chosen with
   a new adaptive, order-based selection of local polynomials which
   minimizes coefficient storage subject to a radially mapped residual
   tolerance. Analytic inversions of the normal equations associated with
   each candidate polynomial allow for rapid solutions to the least squares
   process without resorting to the conventional numerical linear system
   solvers. The gradient and higher order partial derivatives are computed
   directly with no memory cost, and are smooth and continuous to a
   user-specified order. The method is specifically applied to interpolate
   the Grace Gravity Model GGM03C geopotential up to degree and order 360.
   Highly tuned interpolation models of various resolutions are presented
   and discussed in detail. Released Fetch interpolation models of the
   geopotential include resolutions of 33 x 33, 70 x70, 156 x 156 and 360 x
   360. The memory requirements span from 120 MB to 2360 MB, and the
   expected speedups over spherical harmonics evaluations span from similar
   to 10 to similar to 3000 fold. The break even resolution for runtime
   speeds is approximately degree and order 8. The models are globally
   continuous to order 3 and thus may be of interest to a variety of
   science and engineering applications. The runtime evaluation codes along
   with model coefficients are available on the internet.}},

Abstract = {{An entry, descent, and landing architecture capable of achieving Mars
   Science Laboratory class landed accuracy (with 10 km of target) while
   delivering a Mars Exploration Rover class payload to the surface of Mars

   class aeroshell with a rigid, annular drag skirt. Maximum vehicle
   diameter is limited to be compatible with current launch vehicle
   fairings. A single drag skirt jettison event is used to control range
   during entry. Three-degree-of-freedom trajectory simulation is used in
   conjunction with Monte Carlo techniques to assess the flight performance
   of the proposed architecture. Results indicate landed accuracy is
   competitive with pre-flight Mars Science Laboratory estimates, and peak
   heat rate and integrated heat load are significantly reduced relative to
   the Mars Exploration Rover entry system. Modeling parachute descent
   within the onboard guidance algorithm is found to remove range error
   bias present at touchdown; the addition of a range-based parachute
   deploy trigger is found to significantly improve landed accuracy.}},

Title = {{Cathepsins and Other Proteases in Tumor Angiogenesis}},
Booktitle = {{TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS REGULATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{297-339}},
Abstract = {{Cathepsins and other proteases play a role in tumor angiogenesis mainly
   through degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix proteins,
   which promotes vessel ingrowth. Cathepsins are cysteine proteases
   usually resident in lysosomal compartments, but are released to the
   extracellular environment by diseased cells. Tight regulation of
   cathepsin activity prevents aberrant cathepsins from functioning
   extracellularly, but microenvironmental changes in pH, oxidation state,
   and overexpression of enzymes overcome these regulatory mechanisms to
   degrade the collagens, laminins, fibronectins, and other extracellular
   matrix proteins between the growing tumor and the vasculature. These
   enzymes are the most potent collagenases and elastases and are therefore
   able to greatly assist in carving a way for the tumor to metastasize as
   well as for vessels to penetrate. Endothelial cells, tumor cells, tumor
   associated macrophages and other cell types have been shown to
   upregulate these enzymes and play different roles in the angiogenic
   process. This chapter will discuss cathepsin structure and function, and
   the regulation of their activity in normal and tumor environments by
   cells, extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycans, and other biological
   molecules. A particular focus will be on cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V as
   well as cystatin C, their endogenous protein inhibitor as these are most
   implicated in this disease, particularly breast, lung, and prostate
   cancer as well as their metastasis to bone. Traditional and novel
   methods to detect cathepsin activity and the benefits or trade-offs of
   each will be discussed. Finally, therapeutic strategies that target
   inhibition of proteases will be presented with a discussion of their
   controversy and difficulty passing clinical trials due to severe side
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel universal acoustic characterization approach to
   spoken language recognition (LRE). The key idea is to describe any
   spoken language with a common set of fundamental units that can be
   defined ``universally{''} across all spoken languages. In this study,
   speech attributes, such as manner and place of articulation, are chosen
   to form this unit inventory and used to build a set of
   language-universal attribute models with data-driven modeling
   techniques. The vector space modeling approach to LRE is adopted, where
   a spoken utterance is first decoded into a sequence of attributes
   independently of its language. Then, a feature vector is generated by
   using co-occurrence statistics of manner or place units, and the final
   LRE decision is implemented with a vector space language classifier.
   Several architectural configurations will be studied, and it will be
   shown that best performance is attained using a maximal figure-of-merit
   language classifier. Experimental evidence not only demonstrates the
   feasibility of the proposed techniques, but it also shows that the
   proposed technique attains comparable performance to standard approaches
   on the LRE tasks investigated in this work when the same experimental
   conditions are adopted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   materials characterization is an effective method by which ASR gel in
   cement-based materials can be detected and that materials containing ASR
   gel can be distinguished from those without. Further, this work provides
   a basis for the development of field evaluation techniques and lab-based

Abstract = {{We propose a wavelet-based denoising methodology based on total energy
   of a neighboring pair of coefficients plus their ``parental{''}

   are estimated by the empirical Bayes method, and the posterior mean,
   median and Bayes factor are obtained and used in the estimation of the
   total mean energy. Shrinkage of the neighboring coefficients are based
   on the ratio of the estimated and the observed energy. It is shown that
   the methodology is comparable and often superior to several existing and
   established wavelet denoising methods that utilize neighboring
   information, which is demonstrated by extensive simulations on a
   standard battery of test functions. An application to real-word data set

Abstract = {{Designing materials for targeted performance requirements as required in
   Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) demands a combined
   strategy of bottom-up and top-down modeling and simulation which treats
   various levels of hierarchical material structure as a mathematical
   representation, with infusion of systems engineering and informatics to
   deal with differing model degrees of freedom and uncertainty. Moreover,
   with time, the classical materials selection approach is becoming
   generalized to address concurrent design of microstructure or
   mesostructure to satisfy product-level performance requirements.
   Computational materials science and multiscale mechanics models play key
   roles in evaluating performance metrics necessary to support materials
   design. The interplay of systems-based design of materials with
   multiscale modeling methodologies is at the core of materials design. In
   high performance alloys and composite materials, maximum performance is
   often achieved within a relatively narrow window of process path and
   resulting microstructures.
   Much of the attention to ICME in the materials community has focused on
   the role of generating and representing data, including methods for
   characterization and digital representation of microstructure, as well
   as databases and model integration. On the other hand, the computational
   mechanics of materials and multidisciplinary design optimization
   communities are grappling with many fundamental issues related to
   stochasticity of processes and uncertainty of data, models, and
   multiscale modeling chains in decision-based design. This paper explores
   computational and information aspects of design of materials with
   hierarchical microstructures and identifies key underdeveloped elements
   essential to supporting ICME. One of the messages of this overview paper
   is that ICME is not simply an assemblage of existing tools, for such
   tools do not have natural interfaces to material structure nor are they
   framed in a way that quantifies sources of uncertainty and manages
   uncertainty in representing physical phenomena to support decision-based
   design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently a periodic surface model was developed to assist geometric
   construction in computer-aided nano-design. This implicit surface model
   helps create super-porous nano structures parametrically and supports
   crystal packing. In this paper, we propose a new approach for pathway
   search in phase transition simulation of crystal structures. The
   approach relies on the interpolation of periodic loci surface models.
   Respective periodic plane models are reconstructed from the positions of
   individual atoms at the initial and final states, and surface
   correspondences are found. With geometric constraints imposed based on
   physical and chemical properties of crystals, two surface interpolation
   methods are used to approximate the intermediate atom positions on the
   transition pathway in the full search of the minimum energy path. This
   hybrid approach integrates geometry information in the configuration
   space and physics information to allow for an efficient transition
   pathway search. The methods are demonstrated by examples of FeTi, VO2,
   and FePt. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The South African sugar industry has a potential for cogeneration of
   steam and electricity using bagasse. The sugar industry has the
   potential to generate about 960 MW per year from bagasse based on the
   average of 20 million tons of sugar cane crushed per year. Renewable
   energy sources like bagasse are generally regarded as cleaner energy
   sources as opposed to coal-derived energy. However, the environmental
   benefits of power production from bagasse must be verified using a
   systematic scientific methodology. This study develops the life cycle
   inventories for bagasse power production in South Africa. The life cycle
   inventory can help to evaluate the environmental impacts of the
   cogeneration throughout the life cycle. The data for this inventory
   stage of the research was supplied by the sugar industry, and the
   analysis mostly uses South African data in the inventory stage. The
   study presents life cycle inventories based on a functional unit of 1
   GWh of bagasse-derived electricity produced in the South African sugar
   industry. A comparison of the current generating output with a proposed
   higher output shows that more energy can be produced in addition to
   reduced inventory levels and this has the potential to improve
   environmental performance of bagasse power generation in South Africa.

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{265-270}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most ultrasonic guided wave methods require tone burst excitations to
   achieve some degree of mode purity while maintaining temporal
   resolution. In addition, it is often desirable to acquire data using
   multiple frequencies, particularly during method development when the
   best frequency for a specific application is not known. However, this
   process is inconvenient and time-consuming, particularly if extensive
   signal averaging at each excitation frequency is required to achieve a
   satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. Both acquisition time and data
   storage requirements may be prohibitive if responses from many
   narrowband tone burst excitations are measured. Here chirp excitations
   are utilized to address the need to both test at multiple frequencies
   and achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio to minimize acquisition time. A
   broadband chirp is used to acquire data at a wide range of frequencies,
   and deconvolution is applied to extract multiple narrowband responses.
   After optimizing the frequency and duration of the desired tone burst
   excitation, a long-time narrowband chirp is used as the actual
   excitation, and the desired tone burst response is similarly extracted
   during post-processing. Results are shown that demonstrate the efficacy
   of both broadband and narrowband chirp excitations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{Interfacial phenomena due to surface forces are important in
   microfluidic devices with their relatively large surface areas and small
   volumes. This article reviews our recent studies measuring fluid
   velocities in Poiseuille and electrokinetically driven flows over the
   first similar to 0.4 mu m next to the wall from the motion of an
   ensemble of O(10(5)) fluorescent particles illuminated by evanescent
   waves. Because the evanescent-wave intensity decays exponentially with
   wall-normal distance, the particle-wall separation can be determined
   from the brightness of each particle image, and used to estimate the
   steady-state distribution of the tracers near the wall. More recently,
   evanescent-wave illumination has been combined with fluorescence
   thermometry, to estimate water temperature fields from changes in the
   fluorescence intensity of aqueous fluorophore solutions. Poiseuille flow
   of a fluorescein solution at Reynolds numbers of 3.3 and 8.3 through a
   heated minichannel was illuminated with evanescent waves to measure
   solution temperatures at an average distance of 74 nm from the wall. The
   temperature results obtained over three different regions were in good
   agreement with numerical predictions of the wall surface temperature,
   even in the presence of temperature variations exceeding 9 degrees C

Abstract = {{We present a real-space formulation for coarse-graining Kohn-Sham
   Density Functional Theory that significantly speeds up the analysis of
   material defects without appreciable loss of accuracy. The approximation
   scheme consists of two steps. First, we develop a linear-scaling method
   that enables the direct evaluation of the electron density without the
   need to evaluate individual orbitals. We achieve this by performing
   Gauss quadrature over the spectrum of the linearized Hamiltonian
   operator appearing in each iteration of the self-consistent field
   method. Building on the linear-scaling method, we introduce a spatial
   approximation scheme resulting in a coarse-grained Density Functional
   Theory. The spatial approximation is adapted so as to furnish fine
   resolution where necessary and to coarsen elsewhere. This
   coarse-graining step enables the analysis of defects at a fraction of
   the original computational cost, without any significant loss of
   accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the coarse-grained solutions are
   convergent with respect to the spatial approximation. We illustrate the
   scope, versatility, efficiency and accuracy of the scheme by means of
   selected examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{K-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering
   algorithm. Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this
   algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster
   centers. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address
   this problem. In this paper, we first present an overview of these
   methods with an emphasis on their computational efficiency. We then
   compare eight commonly used linear time complexity initialization
   methods on a large and diverse collection of data sets using various
   performance criteria. Finally, we analyze the experimental results using
   nonparametric statistical tests and provide recommendations for
   practitioners. We demonstrate that popular initialization methods often
   perform poorly and that there are in fact strong alternatives to these
   methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{78-86}},
Abstract = {{The rapid growth of online social networking over the past decade has
   generated substantial amounts of data about individuals and their social
   relationships. Recent research studies investigating social
   relationships and travel behavior have sought connections between
   individuals' social networks and socially related travel; however, to
   the authors' knowledge, no study has pursued the use of online social
   networking data to do so. This study explores the use of online social
   network data in characterizing individuals' air travel behavior. Data
   were collected through a web-based survey including information about
   individuals' air travel history and online social network information,
   specifically participants' Facebook networks. The data were then
   analyzed to address a series of hypotheses about the association between
   online social network characteristics (specifically Facebook) and air
   travel behavior, in particular, travel distance, leisure-related travel,
   and trip generation. This study found a positive relationship between
   the size and distribution of individuals' Facebook social networks and
   both their engagement in air travel and the odds that their air travel
   will be leisure related or will include a leisure component.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate an improved scheme to generate

   loop based on single sideband (SSB) modulation. We re-build the RFS
   structure with better performance. By using MC-RFS loop, we can generate
   N-channel subcarriers each round trip without interference. These
   subcarriers of each channel are stable and frequency-locked, which can
   be used for multi-channel WDM source. The dual-channel RFS loop is
   carried out for demonstration in our experiment with dual-carrier
   source. Using this scheme, we successfully generate 62 frequency-locked
   subcarriers with 25-GHz frequency spacing in 2 channels and each channel

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental technique to identify robust
   nanoscale coatings for improving the long-term reliability of metallic
   microelectromechanical systems. More specifically, the influence of
   nanoscale alumina coatings on the fatigue crack initiation process in 20
   mu m thick electrodeposited Ni films was investigated in a mild (30
   degrees C, 50\% RH) and harsh (80 degrees C, 90\% RH) environment.
   Atomic-layer-deposited alumina layers, with thicknesses of 5 and 25 nm,
   were coated on Ni fatigue micro-resonators, and the fatigue degradation
   behavior in the very high cycle fatigue regime was compared to that of
   uncoated structures. Evidence based on post-test scanning electron
   microscopy and resonant frequency evolution plots shows that the
   coatings do not prevent the formation of fatigue extrusions and
   micro-cracks. However, their formation is likely delayed for the 25 nm
   thick alumina-coated Ni films. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A laboratory-scale study was conducted to assess the feasibility of the
   production of fired bricks from sediments dredged from the Savannah
   Harbor (Savannah, GA, USA). The dredged sediment was used as the sole
   raw material, or as a 50\% replacement for natural brick-making clay.
   Sediment bricks were prepared using the stiff mud extrusion process from
   raw mixes consisted of 100\% dredged sediment, or 50\% dredged sediment
   and 50\% brick clay. The bricks were fired at temperatures between 900
   and 1000 degrees C. Physical and mechanical properties of the dredged
   sediment brick were found to generally comply with ASTM criteria for
   building brick. Water absorption of the dredged sediment bricks was in
   compliance with the criteria for brick graded for severe (SW) or
   moderate (MW) weathering. Compressive strength of 100\% dredged sediment
   bricks ranged from 8.3 to 11.7 MPa; the bricks sintered at 1000 degrees
   C met the requirements for negligible weathering (NW) building brick.
   Mixing the dredged sediment with natural clay resulted in an increase of
   the compressive strength. The compressive strength of the sediment-clay
   bricks fired at 1000 degrees C was 29.4 MPa, thus meeting the ASTM
   requirements for the SW grade building brick. Results of this study
   demonstrate that production of fired bricks is a promising and
   achievable productive reuse alternative for Savannah Harbor dredged
   sediments. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the existence and stability of defect gap solitons in real

   a positive defect, the fundamental solitons exist in the semi-infinite
   gaps, and they are stable in wide regions. For a negative defect,
   solitons can exist in the semi-infinite gap and in the first gap. In the
   semi-infinite gap, solitons are also stable in a wide region, but are
   unstable in the region near the Bloch band. In the first gap, solitons
   are stable. With an increase of the amplitude of the imaginary part of
   the PT-symmetric nonlinear optical potentials, the stable region in the
   semi-infinite gap is shrunk; solitons are only stable in the moderate
   power region. In the first gap, solitons are unstable in the high-power

Title = {{Storage change in a flat-lying fracture during well tests}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{The volume of water released from storage per unit head drop per volume
   of an REV is a basic quantity in groundwater hydrology, but the details
   of the process of storage change in the vicinity of a well are commonly
   overlooked. We characterize storage change in a flat-lying fracture or
   thin sedimentary bed through the apparent hydraulic compliance, C-f, the
   change in aperture of the fracture or thickness of the layer per unit
   change in pressure. The results of theoretical analyses and field
   measurements show that C-f increases with time near the well during
   pumping, but it drops suddenly and may become negative at the beginning
   of recovery during a well test. Profiles of C-f increase with radial
   distance from a well, but they are marked by a sharp increase and a
   sharp decrease at the edge of the region affected by the wellbore
   pressure transient. The conventional view in groundwater hydrology is
   that storage change at a point is proportional to the local change in
   pressure, which requires that the hydraulic compliance is uniform and
   constant. It appears that this conventional view is a simplification of
   a process that varies in both space and time and can even take on
   negative values. This simplification may be a source of uncertainty when
   interpreting well tests and extensometer records or predicting long-term
   well performance. Citation: Murdoch, L. C., and L. N. Germanovich

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{6, 1}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{A method for automated coarse-graining of bulk polymers is presented,
   using the data-mining tool of local feature analysis. Most existing
   methods for polymer coarse-graining define superatoms based on their
   covalent bonding topology along the polymer backbone, but here
   superatoms are defined based only on their correlated motions, as
   observed in molecular dynamics simulations. Correlated atomic motions
   are identified in the simulation data using local feature analysis,
   between atoms in the same or in different polymer chains. Groups of
   highly correlated atoms constitute the superatoms in the coarse-graining
   scheme, and the positions of their seed coordinates are then projected
   forward in time. Based on only the seed positions, local feature
   analysis enables the full reconstruction of all atomic positions. This
   reconstruction suggests an iterative scheme to reduce the computation of
   the simulations to initialize another short molecular dynamic
   simulation, identify new superatoms, and again project forward in time.

Abstract = {{The use of anion-exchange chromatography was investigated as an

   parameters for different bacteriophages were compared. Chromatography
   was performed with Convective Interactive Media (R) monoliths, with
   three different volumes and two matrix chemistries. Eleven
   morphologically distinct phages were tested, infecting five different
   bacterial species. For each of the phages tested, a protocol was
   optimized, including the choice of column chemistry, loading, buffer and
   elution conditions. The capacity and recovery of the phages on the
   columns varied considerably between phages. We conclude that
   anion-exchange chromatography with monoliths is a valid alternative to
   the more traditional CsCl purification, has upscaling advantages, but it
   requires more extensive optimization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Identifying the optimal spatially and temporally invariant root
   distribution for a semiarid environment}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{In semiarid regions, the rooting strategies employed by vegetation can
   be critical to its survival. Arid regions are characterized by high
   variability in the arrival of rainfall, and species found in these areas
   have adapted mechanisms to ensure the capture of this scarce resource.
   Vegetation roots have strong control over this partitioning, and
   assuming a static root profile, predetermine the manner in which this
   partitioning is undertaken. A coupled, dynamic vegetation and hydrologic
   model, tRIBS vertical bar VEGGIE, was used to explore the role of
   vertical root distribution on hydrologic fluxes. Point-scale simulations
   were carried out using two spatially and temporally invariant rooting
   schemes: uniform: a one-parameter model and logistic : a two-parameter
   model. The simulations were forced with a stochastic climate generator
   calibrated to weather stations and rain gauges in the semiarid Walnut
   Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Arizona. A series of simulations
   were undertaken exploring the parameter space of both rooting schemes
   and the optimal root distribution for the simulation, which was defined
   as the root distribution with the maximum mean transpiration over a
   100-yr period, and this was identified. This optimal root profile was
   determined for five generic soil textures and two plant-functional types
   (PFTs) to illustrate the role of soil texture on the partitioning of
   moisture at the land surface. The simulation results illustrate the
   strong control soil texture has on the partitioning of rainfall and
   consequently the depth of the optimal rooting profile. High-conductivity
   soils resulted in the deepest optimal rooting profile with land surface
   moisture fluxes dominated by transpiration. As we move toward the lower
   conductivity end of the soil spectrum, a shallowing of the optimal
   rooting profile is observed and evaporation gradually becomes the
   dominate flux from the land surface. This study offers a methodology
   through which local plant, soil, and climate can be accounted for in the
   parameterization of rooting profiles in semiarid regions. Citation:

Abstract = {{The adjoints of the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model and a
   comprehensive cloud droplet parameterization are coupled to study the
   sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) over US regions
   and Central Europe to global emissions of anthropogenic fine mode
   aerosol precursors. Simulations reveal that the N-d over the midwestern
   and southeastern US is mostly sensitive to SO2 emissions during August,
   and to NH3 emissions during February. Over the western US, N-d is mostly
   sensitivity to SO2 and primary organic aerosol emissions. In Central
   Europe, N-d is most sensitive to NH3 and NOx emissions. As expected,
   local emissions strongly affect N-d; long-range transport, however, is
   also important for the western US and Europe. Emissions changes
   projected for the year 2050 are estimated to have the largest impacts on

Abstract = {{We describe a synthesis of Au wavy nanowires in an aqueous solution in
   the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The resultant Au
   nanowires automatically separated from the solution and floated at the
   air/water interface. We investigated the formation mechanism by
   characterizing the samples obtained at different stages of the
   synthesis. Both particle attachment and cold welding were found to be
   involved in the formation of such nanowires. Based on X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, the CTAB
   molecules adsorbed on the surface of a Au nanostructure went through a
   change in structure from a bilayer to a monolayer, converting the Au
   surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. As a result, the Au wavy
   nanowires were driven to the air/water interface during the synthesis.
   This growth mechanism is potentially extendable to many other systems
   involving small surfactant molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the performance of typical water treatment UV reactors is
   challenging due to the complexity in assessing spatial and temporal
   variation of UV fluence, resulting from highly unsteady, turbulent
   nature of flow and variation in UV intensity. In this study,
   three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence (3DLIF) was applied to
   visualize and quantitatively analyze a lab-scale UV reactor consisting
   of one lamp sleeve placed perpendicular to flow. Mapping the spatial and
   temporal fluence delivery and MS2 inactivation revealed the highest
   local fluence in the wake zone due to longer residence time and higher
   UV exposure, while the lowest local fluence occurred in a region near
   the walls due to short-circuiting flow and lower UV fluence rate.
   Comparing the tracer based decomposition between hydrodynamics and IT
   revealed similar coherent structures showing the dependency of fluence
   delivery on the reactor flow. The location of tracer injection, varying
   the height and upstream distance from the lamp center, was found to
   significantly affect the UV fluence received by the tracer. A
   Lagrangian-based analysis was also employed to predict the fluence along
   specific paths of travel, which agreed with the experiments. The 3DLIF
   technique developed in this study provides new insight on dose delivery
   that fluctuates both spatially and temporally and is expected to aid
   design and optimization of UV reactors as well as validate computational
   fluid dynamics models that are widely used to simulate UV reactor
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue degradation properties of atomic-layer-deposited alumina,

   silicon micro-resonator on which the coatings were deposited and
   strained in a static or cyclic manner, with strain amplitudes up to
   2.2\%, in controlled environments. Based on the measured resonant
   frequency evolution, post-test scanning electron microscopy
   observations, and finite element models, it is shown that cracks in the
   alumina nucleate and propagate under cyclic loading, and that the crack
   growth rates scale with the strain energy release rates for crack
   channeling. The implications for the reliability of flexible electronics

Abstract = {{We study the impact of thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at carbon
   nanotube (CNT)-substrate interfaces and CNT junctions on power
   dissipation and breakdown in CNT network based thin film transistors

   model of CN-TFTs to experimental measurements of power dissipation and
   temperature profiles allows us to estimate the average CNT-SiO2 TBC as g
   similar to 0.16Wm(-1) K-1 and the TBC at CNT junctions as G(C) similar
   to 2.4 pWK(-1). We find the peak power dissipation in CN-TFTs is more
   strongly correlated to the TBC of the CNT-substrate interface than to
   the TBC at CNT junctions. Molecular dynamics simulations of crossed CNT
   junctions also reveal that the top CNT is buckled over similar to 30 nm
   lengths, losing direct contact with the substrate and creating highly
   localized hot-spots. Our results provide new insights into CNT network
   properties which can be engineered to enhance performance of CN-TFTs for

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on terabit superchannel transmission with enhanced
   network reach by using an emerging noise-suppressed Nyquist wavelength
   division multiplexing (NS-N-WDM) technique for polarization multiplexing
   quadrature phase shift keying subchannels at different symbol rate to
   subchannel spacing ratios up to 1.28, and for the first time, it was
   compared experimentally with the transmission capability of
   no-guard-interval coherent optical orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (NGI-CO-OFDM) on the same testbed. At 22 x 10(-3) bit error
   ratio, the maximum reachable distance is 3200 and 2800 km SMF-28 with
   erbium-doped-fiber-amplifier-only amplification for NGI-CO-OFDM and
   NS-N-WDM terabit super-channels, respectively, at 100 Gb/s/ch. For 11 x
   112 and 11 x 128 Gb/s/ch NS-N-WDM transmission under assumption of
   different coding gain with hard-decision and soft-decision forward error
   correction, their maximum achievable distance was found to be
   equivalent, which are 2100 and 2170 km, respectively, both were achieved
   by using digital noise filtering and 1-bit maximum likelihood sequence
   estimation at the receiver DSP. In addition, the back-to-back
   characteristics of NS-N-WDM superchannel such as analog-to-digital
   converter bandwidth requirement and its tolerance to unequal subchannel
   power were experimentally evaluated and studied.}},

Abstract = {{Successful joint experiments with Deutsche Telecom (DT) on long-haul
   transmission of 100 G and beyond are demonstrated over standard
   single-mode fiber (SSMF) and inline erbium-doped fiber amplifier-only
   amplification. The transmission link consists of eight nodes and 950-km
   installed SSMF in DT's optical infrastructure with the addition of lab
   SSMF for extended optical reach. The first field transmission of 8
   216.8-Gb/s Nyquist-WDM signals is reported over 1750-km distance with
   21.6-dB average loss per span. Each channel modulated by a 54.2-Gbaud
   PDM-CSRZ-QPSK signal is on 50-GHz grid, achieving a net spectral
   efficiency (SE) of 4 bit/s/Hz. We also demonstrate mixed data-rate
   transmission coexisting with 1 T, 400 G, and 100 G channels. The 400 G
   uses four independent subcarriers modulated by 28-Gbaud PDM-QPSK
   signals, yielding the net SE of 4 bit/s/Hz while 13 optically generated
   subcarriers from single optical source are employed in 1 T channel with
   25-Gbaud PDM-QPSK modulation. The 100 G signal uses real-time coherent
   PDM-QPSK transponder with 15\% overhead of soft-decision forward- error
   correction. The digital postfilter and 1-bit maximum likelihood sequence
   estimation are introduced at the receiver DSP to suppress noise, linear
   crosstalk, and filtering effects. Our results show the future 400 G and
   1 T channels utilizing the Nyquist wavelength division multiplexing
   technique can transmit long-haul distance with higher SE using the same
   QPSK format.}},

Abstract = {{Using a process-guided approach, a new 6FDA-based polyimide
   6FDA-DAM:DABA(4:1) has been developed in the form of hollow fiber
   membranes for CO2 recovery from post-combustion flue gas streams. Dense
   film studies on this polymer reveal a CO2 permeability of 224 Barrers at
   40 degrees C at a CO2 feed pressure of 10 psia. The dense films exhibit
   an ideal CO2/N-2 permselectivity of 20 at 40 degrees C, which permits
   their use in a two-step counter-flow/sweep membrane process. Dry-jet,
   wet-quench, nonsolvent-induced phase inversion spinning was used to
   create defect-free hollow fibers from 6FDA-DAM:DABA(4:1). Membranes with
   defect-free skin layers, approximately 415 nm thick, were obtained with
   a pure CO2 permeance of 520 GPU at 30 degrees C and an ideal CO2/N-2
   permselectivity of 24. Mixed gas permeation and wet gas permeation are
   presented for the fibers. The CO2 permeance in the fibers was reduced by
   approximately a factor of 2 in feeds with 80\% humidity. As a
   proof-of-concept path forward to increase CO2 flux, we incorporated
   microporous ZIF-8 fillers into 6FDA-DAM:DABA(4:1) dense films. Our
   6FDA-DAM:DABA(4:1)/ZIF-8 dense film composites (20 wt\% ZIF-8) had a CO2
   permeability of 550 Barrers and a CO2/N-2 selectivity of 19 at 35
   degrees C. Good adhesion between the ZIF and the 6FDA-DAM:DABA(4:1)
   matrix was observed. CO2 capture costs of \$27/ton of CO2 using the
   current, ``nonoptimized{''} membrane are estimated using a custom
   counterflow membrane model. Hollow fiber membrane modules were estimated
   to have order-of-magnitude reductions in system footprint relative to
   spiral-wound modules, thereby making them attractive in current
   space-constrained coal-fired power stations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   membranes for hybrid membrane-distillation processes for olefin/paraffin

Abstract = {{In this paper, the development of asymmetric carbon molecular sieve
   (CMS) hollow fiber membranes and advanced processes for olefin/paraffin
   separations based on the CMS membranes are reported. Membrane-based
   olefin/paraffin separations have been pursued extensively over the past
   decades. CMS membranes are promising to exceed the performance upper
   bound of polymer materials and have demonstrated excellent stability for
   gas separations. Previously, a substructure collapse phenomenon was
   found in Matrimid (R) precursor derived CMS fiber. To overcome the
   permeance loss due to the increased separation layer thickness, 6FDA-DAM
   and 6FDA/BPDA-DAM precursors were selected as potential new precursors
   for carbon membrane formation. Defect-free asymmetric 6FDA-DAM and
   6FDA/BPDA-DAM hollow fibers were successfully fabricated from a
   dry-jet/wet-quench spinning process. Polymer rigidity, glass-rubber
   transition and asymmetric morphology were correlated. CMS hollow fiber
   membranes produced from 6FDA-polymer precursors showed significant
   improvement in permeance for ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane
   separations. Further studies revealed that the CMS membranes are
   olefins-selective, which means the membranes are able to effectively
   separate olefins (ethylene and propylene) from paraffins (ethane and
   propane). This unique feature of CMS materials enables advanced hybrid
   membrane-distillation process designs. By using the olefins-selective
   membranes, these new processes may provide advantages over previously
   proposed retrofitting concepts. Further applications of the membranes
   are explored for hydrocarbons processes. Significant energy savings and
   even reduced footprint may be achieved in olefins production units. (c)

   set of 20 small molecules, single and double-excitation configuration
   interaction (CISD), quadratic CISD (QCISD), and CCSD correlation
   energies could be reproduced with millihartree accuracy after the
   introduction of these approximations. Our approach exploits otherwise
   hidden factorizable tensor structure in both the electron repulsion
   integrals and the wavefunction coefficients and should be applicable

Abstract = {{The least-squares tensor hypercontraction (LS-THC) representation for
   the electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor is presented. Recently, we
   developed the generic tensor hypercontraction (THC) ansatz, which
   represents the fourth-order ERI tensor as a product of five second-order
   tensors {[} E. G. Hohenstein, R. M. Parrish, and T. J. Martinez, J.
   Chem. Phys. 137, 044103 (2012)]. Our initial algorithm for the
   generation of the THC factors involved a two-sided invocation of
   overlapmetric density fitting, followed by a PARAFAC decomposition, and
   is denoted PARAFAC tensor hypercontraction (PF-THC). LS-THC supersedes
   PF-THC by producing the THC factors through a least-squares
   renormalization of a spatial quadrature over the otherwise singular
   1/r(12) operator. Remarkably, an analytical and simple formula for the
   LS-THC factors exists. Using this formula, the factors may be generated
   with O(N-5) effort if exact integrals are decomposed, or O(N-4) effort
   if the decomposition is applied to density-fitted integrals, using any
   choice of density fitting metric. The accuracy of LS-THC is explored for
   a range of systems using both conventional and density-fitted integrals
   in the context of MP2. The grid fitting error is found to be negligible
   even for extremely sparse spatial quadrature grids. For the case of
   density-fitted integrals, the additional error incurred by the grid
   fitting step is generally markedly smaller than the underlying
   Coulomb-metric density fitting error. The present results, coupled with
   our previously published factorizations of MP2 and MP3, provide an
   efficient, robust O(N-4) approach to both methods. Moreover, LS-THC is
   generally applicable to many other methods in quantum chemistry. (C)

Abstract = {{A sustainable global community requires the successful integration of
   environment and engineering. In the public and private sectors,
   designing cyclical ({''}closed loop{''}) resource networks increasingly
   appears as a strategy employed to improve resource efficiency and reduce
   environmental impacts. Patterning industrial networks on ecological ones
   has been shown to provide significant improvements at multiple levels.
   Here, we apply the biological metric cyclicity to 28 familiar
   thermodynamic power cycles of increasing complexity. These cycles,
   composed of turbines and the like, are scientifically very different
   from natural ecosystems. Despite this difference, the application
   results in a positive correlation between the maximum thermal efficiency
   and the cyclic structure of the cycles. The immediate impact of these
   findings results in a simple method for comparing cycles to one another,
   higher cyclicity values pointing to those cycles which have the
   potential for a higher maximum thermal efficiency. Such a strong
   correlation has the promise of impacting both natural ecology and
   engineering thermodynamics and provides a clear motivation to look for
   more fundamental scientific connections between natural and engineered
   systems. Citation: Layton A, Reap J, Bras B, Weissburg M (2012)

Abstract = {{Conjugated polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are
   widely recognized as a promising alternative to their inorganic
   counterparts for achieving low-cost, roll-to-roll production of
   large-area flexible lightweight photovoltaic devices. Current research
   in designing new polymers and optimizing device architectures has been
   devoted to improving the film morphology, photovoltaic performance and
   stability of polymer BHJ solar cells. Conjugated block copolymers
   (BCPs), including rod coil and rod rod BCPs, exhibit excellent
   flexibility for tuning the bandgap of semiconductor polymers, regulating
   the molecular organization of donor (and/or acceptor) units, templating
   the film morphology of active layers, and achieving well-defined BHJ
   architectures. In this Feature Article, we summarize the recent
   developments over the past five years in the synthesis, self-assembly,
   and utilization of conjugated rod coil and all-conjugated rod rod BCPs
   for solar energy conversion; highlight the correlation between the
   microphase-separated morphology and photovoltaic properties in
   conjugated BCPs; and finally provide an outlook on the future of
   BCP-based photovoltaic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Organic materials, such as paraffin wax, are sought as stable and
   environmentally friendly phase change materials (PCM) for thermal energy
   storage, but they suffer from low thermal conductivity which limits the
   rate at which thermal energy flows into and out of the material. A
   common method to improve the PCM thermal behavior is through loading
   with high thermal conductivity particulate fillers. However, the
   stability of these composites in the molten state is a concern as
   settling of the fillers will change the effective thermal conductivity.
   In this work, we investigate the stability of wax loaded with exfoliated
   graphite nanoplatelets either of 1 mu m (xGnP-1) or 15 mu m (xGnP-15)
   diameter. The effect of dispersants, oxidation of the wax, viscosity of
   the wax, mixing time, and hydrocarbon chain length on stability is
   reported. It was found that the addition of octadecylphosphonic acid
   (ODPA) is an effective dispersant for xGnP in paraffin and
   microcrystalline wax. In addition, mixing time, viscosity, and oxidation
   of the wax influence stability in the molten state. Overall, it was
   found that a mixing time of 24 hours for xGnP-15 along with ODPA mixed
   in a high viscosity, oxidized microcrystalline wax results in composite
   PCM systems with the greatest stability determined at 80 degrees C in
   the molten state.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium phase diagram of ruthenium-zirconium oxide (Ru-Zr-O) was
   calculated by a combination of ab initio density functional theory and
   thermodynamic calculations. The phase diagrams suggest that the
   solubility between ruthenium oxide and zirconium oxide is very low under
   normal experimental conditions, in good agreement with the prior reports
   in literature. Also provided is the theoretical support for the reported
   phenomenon that doping or amorphization of Ru-Zr-O might suppress phase
   separation of the oxide. To study the spinodal decomposition of Ru-Zr-O,
   we successfully prepared an amorphous Ru048Zr0.52O2 film of a solid
   solution phase by a thermal decomposition at a low temperature (563 K).
   In situ transmission electron microscopy was utilized to witness the
   spinodal decomposition of the amorphous Ru0.48Zr0.52O2 solid solution by
   electron-beam annealing. The present fundamental study of the phase
   behavior of Ru-Zr-O provides a guideline for the phase and
   microstructure design of Ru-based mixed oxides for various important

Abstract = {{The quantum-chemical approach COSMO-RS was used to develop
   structure-property relationships of reversible ionic-liquid (RevIL)
   solvents for CO2 capture. Trends predicted for the thermodynamic
   properties of the RevILs using COSMO-RS, such as CO2 solubility, solvent
   regeneration enthalpy, and solvent reversal temperature, were verified
   by experimental data. This method was applied to a range of structures,
   including silylamines with varying alkyl chain lengths attached to the
   silicon and amine functionality, silylamines with fluorinated alkyl
   chains, sterically hindered silylamines and carbon-based analogues. The
   energetics of CO2 capture and release and the CO2 capture capacities are
   compared to those of the conventional capture solvent monoethanolamine.
   The results of this study suggest that the simple COSMO-RS computational
   approaches reported herein can act as a guide for designing new RevILs.
   COSMO-RS allows for the determination of the relative thermodynamic

Title = {{Adjusting the Stability of Metal-Organic Frameworks under Humid
   Conditions by Ligand Functionalization}},

Abstract = {{The practical use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in applications
   ranging from adsorption separations to controlled storage and release
   hinges on their stability in humid or aqueous environments. The
   sensitivity of certain MOFs under humid conditions is well-known, but
   systematic studies of water adsorption properties of MOFs are lacking.
   This information is critical for developing design criteria for
   directing future synthesis efforts. The goal of this work is to
   understand the influence of the extent of Zn-O bond shielding on the
   relative stabilities of MOFs belonging to same family of isostructural,
   noncatenated pillared MOFs {[}Zn(L)(DABCO)(0.5)], where L is the
   functionalized BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) linker. The different
   extent of Zn-O bond shielding is provided by incorporating a broad range
   of functional groups on the BDC ligand. The resulting MOFs have varying
   surface areas, pore sizes, and pore volumes. Stability is assessed
   through water vapor adsorption isotherms combined with powder X-ray
   diffraction (PXRD) experiments and surface area analyses. Our study
   demonstrates that integration of polar functional groups (e.g., nitro,
   bromo, chloro, hydroxy, etc.) on the dicarboxylate linker renders these
   MOFs water unstable compared to the parent MOF as these polar functional
   groups have a negative shielding effect; i.e., they facilitate
   hydrolysis of the Zn-O bond. On the other hand, placing nonpolar groups
   (e.g., methyl) on the BDC ligand results in structurally robust MOFs
   because the Zn-O bond is effectively shielded from attack by water
   molecules. Therefore, the anthracene- and tetramethyl-BDC MOFs do not
   lose crystallinity or surface area after water exposure, in spite of the
   large amount of water adsorption due to capillary condensation at
   similar to 20\% relative humidity (RH). This has been observed rarely in
   the MOF literature. The results of this work show that by ligand
   functionalization it is possible to adjust the water stability of a
   pillared MOF in both the positive and negative directions and, thus,
   provide an important step toward understanding the water adsorption
   behavior of MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a low-cost, compact, and efficient Cr3+:LiCaAlF6 (Cr:LiCAF)
   laser that is broadly tunable in the near infrared (746-887 nm) and
   blue/ultraviolet (375-433 nm) regions of the optical spectrum. The pump
   source is a 660 nm single-mode-diode with 145 mW of output power. A
   melt-grown Cr: LiCAF crystal with an extremely high figure of merit
   above 2000 was used as the gain medium. This enabled the construction of
   a high-Q-cavity with continuous wave (cw) lasing thresholds as low as 3
   mW, slope efficiencies as high as 54\%, and output powers up to 63 mW.
   The stored intracavity power levels were above 30 W. By placing a
   beta-barium-borate crystal at a second intracavity focus, we could
   obtain tunable cw blue/ultraviolet radiation with output powers up to
   3.5 mW around 400 nm. When mode-locked using a saturable Bragg reflector
   around 800 nm, the Cr: LiCAF laser produced 95 fs pulses with average
   powers of 33 mW and peak powers of 3.58 kW at a repetition rate of 85.5
   MHz. Extracavity second harmonic generation enables generation of
   femtosecond pulses around 400 nm. These results demonstrate the
   possibility to grow Cr: LiCAF crystals with passive losses below 0.15\%
   per cm, which enables construction of low-cost and complexity systems
   that are pumped only with one low-power single-mode-diode. (c) 2012

   integro-differential equation for the third-order Hamiltonian dynamics
   of a potential flow of an incompressible, infinitely deep fluid with a
   free surface. Special travelling wave solutions of this compact equation
   are numerically constructed using the Petviashvili method. Their
   stability properties are also investigated. In particular, unstable
   travelling waves with wedge-type singularities, namely peakons, are
   numerically discovered. To gain insight into the properties of these
   singular solutions, we also consider the academic case of a perturbed
   version of the compact equation, for which analytical peakons with
   exponential shape are derived. Finally, by means of an accurate
   Fourier-type spectral scheme it is found that smooth solitary waves
   appear to collide elastically, suggesting the integrability of the
   Zakharov equation.}},

Abstract = {{The residual stress field of a nonlinear elastic solid with a
   spherically symmetric distribution of point defects is obtained
   explicitly using methods from differential geometry. The material
   manifold of a solid with distributed point defects-where the body is
   stress-free-is a flat Weyl manifold, i.e. a manifold with an affine
   connection that has non-metricity with vanishing traceless part, but
   both its torsion and curvature tensors vanish. Given a spherically
   symmetric point defect distribution, we construct its Weyl material
   manifold using the method of Cartan's moving frames. Having the material
   manifold, the anelasticity problem is transformed to a nonlinear
   elasticity problem and reduces the problem of computing the residual
   stresses to finding an embedding into the Euclidean ambient space. In
   the case of incompressible neo-Hookean solids, we calculate explicitly
   this residual stress field. We consider the example of a finite ball and
   a point defect distribution uniform in a smaller ball and vanishing
   elsewhere. We show that the residual stress field inside the smaller
   ball is uniform and hydrostatic. We also prove a nonlinear analogue of
   Eshelby's celebrated inclusion problem for a spherical inclusion in an
   isotropic incompressible nonlinear solid.}},

   respective 4H-dithieno-{[}3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP) derivatives using
   cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis absorption, and differential scanning
   calorimetry analyses. Organic field-effect transistors were fabricated
   using solution-processed films, and only one derivative,
   bis-tricyanovinyl-DSP, exhibited transistor behavior with mu(e) reaching
   8.7 X 10(-4) cm(2)/V.s. This enhancement of the electron-transporting
   properties in comparison with DTP derivative is attributed to stronger
   LUMO-LUMO interaction due to a larger size of selenium atom, which in
   the case of the bis-tricyanovinyl derivative, has wave function density
   on the chalcogen.}},

Abstract = {{Polystyrene-capped barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanoparticles with sizes of
   11 nm and 27 nm were prepared using amphiphilic star-like diblock
   copolymer templates. The crystal structure evolution of these
   nanoparticles over a wide temperature range (10-428 K) was investigated
   by powder X-ray diffraction. The Rietveld refinement indicates that the
   abrupt structural transitions observed in micron-sized powders become
   broad as the particle size is reduced to a few tens of nanometers. The
   orthorhombic phase (Amm2) is observed in the range of 10-388 K,
   coexisting with the rhombohedral phase (R3c) at lower temperatures and
   with the tetragonal phase (P4mm) at higher temperatures. At room
   temperature (300 K), polystyrene-capped BaTiO3 nanoparticles, both 11
   and 27 nm sizes, primarily adopt the tetragonal phase, transforming to
   the cubic phase (Pm (3) over barm) at 398 K during heating. The phase
   evolution of the nanoparticles correlates well with their dielectric
   behavior. With the Landauer-Bruggeman effective approximation, the
   dielectric properties at room temperature of the BaTiO3 core were
   calculated and the results are in agreement with the size effect of
   BaTiO3 nanocrystals.}},

   computed tomography (XFCT) for a simultaneous determination of the
   spatial distribution and amount of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) within

   successfully produced XFCT images accurately showing the regions
   containing small amount of GNPs (on the order of 0.1 mg) within a 3 cm
   diameter plastic phantom. In particular, the performance of the current
   XFCT setup was improved remarkably (e. g., at least a factor of 3
   reduction in XFCT scan time) using a tin-filtered polychromatic beam in
   comparison with a lead-filtered beam. The results of this study strongly
   suggest that the current benchtop XFCT configuration can be made
   practical with a few modifications such as the deployment of array
   detectors, while meeting realistic constraints on x-ray dose, scan time
   and image resolution for routine pre-clinical in vivo imaging with GNPs.}},

Abstract = {{In cold wet weather, mammals face hypothermia if they cannot dry
   themselves. By rapidly oscillating their bodies, through a process
   similar to shivering, furry mammals can dry themselves within seconds.
   We use high-speed videography and fur particle tracking to characterize
   the shakes of 33 animals (16 animals species and five dog breeds),
   ranging over four orders of magnitude in mass from mice to bears. We
   here report the power law relationship between shaking frequency f and
   body mass M to be f similar to M-0.22, which is close to our prediction
   of f similar to M-0.19 based upon the balance of centrifugal and
   capillary forces. We also observe a novel role for loose mammalian
   dermal tissue: by whipping around the body, it increases the speed of
   drops leaving the animal and the ensuing dryness relative to tight
   dermal tissue.}},

Pages = {{3312-3322}},

Abstract = {{Social insects work together to complete tasks. However, different
   individuals within a colony may vary in task proficiency. We
   investigated if fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) worker body size
   influenced the ability to construct tunnels-a key component of
   subterranean nests. We monitored excavation by worker groups in a
   substrate of small wetted glass particles in quasi-two-dimensional
   arenas. Morphological and network features of the tunnel system were
   measured. Total tunnel area did not differ significantly between groups
   of large and small workers, although the tunnel area of control sized
   workers was significantly larger than that of large workers. Moreover,
   large workers created wider but shorter tunnels, with slower growth rate
   of tunnel number. However, edge-vertex scaling and degree distribution
   of the tunnel network were similar across all treatments. In all cases,
   the amount of excavated material was correlated with the number of
   active workers. Our study reveals that morphological features of
   excavated tunnels show modest variation when constructed by workers of
   varying sizes, but topological features associated with the tunnel
   network are conserved. These results suggest that important behavioural
   aspects of tunnel construction-and thus nest building-are similar among
   morphologically distinct members of fire ant societies.}},

Abstract = {{pi-pi interactions are integral to many areas of chemistry,
   biochemistry, and materials science. Here we use electronic structure
   theory to analyze how pi-pi interactions change as the pi-systems are
   curved in model complexes based on coronene and corannulene dimers.
   Curvature redistributes electronic charge in the pi-cloud and creates a
   dipole moment in these systems, leading to enhanced intermolecular
   electrostatic interactions in the concave-convex (nested) geometries
   that are the focus of this work. Curvature of both monomers also has a
   geometric effect on the interaction by decreasing the average C C
   distance between monomers and by increasing the magnitude of both
   favorable London dispersion interactions and unfavorable
   exchange-repulsion interactions. Overall, increasing curvature in nested
   pi-pi interactions leads to more favorable interaction energies
   regardless of the native state of the monomers, except at short
   distances where the most highly curved systems are less favorable as
   exchange repulsion terms begin to the interaction. dominate}},

Abstract = {{Van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic double layer (EDL) interactions
   between a sphere and a cylinder are determined using the surface element
   integration (SEI) technique. Compared with Derjaguin approximation, the
   SEI technique gives more accurate predictions for the EDL interaction
   between a sphere and a cylinder. However, the SEI technique slightly
   overestimates the vdW interaction compared with predictions based on
   Hamaker's approach. The curvature effect is important at small
   cylinder-to-sphere size ratios, but when the ratio is greater than 10,
   both EDL and vdW interactions between a sphere and a cylinder can be
   approximated adequately by that between a sphere and a flat plate. In
   addition, as Debye length decreases, the EDL interaction energy between
   a sphere and a cylinder decays more quickly. At small separation
   distances, a smaller Debye length leads to a stronger EDL interaction
   between a sphere and a cylinder, whereas at large separation distances,
   a larger Debye length results in a stronger EDL interaction. The
   combination of vdW and EDL interactions, known as the
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, was applied to the
   problem of colloidal fouling in hollow fiber membrane filtration. At low
   ionic strength (0.001 M), a smaller energy barrier exists between
   smaller particles and the membrane, hence smaller particles more easily
   attach to the fiber and subsequently cause more severe colloidal
   fouling. At high ionic strength (0.1 M), the energy barrier is
   eliminated for all particle sizes, which implies that colloidal fouling
   is more severe at elevated ionic strength. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The first ever conceptualization, design, fabrication and successful
   experimental demonstration of a thermally activated microscale
   absorption heat pump for miniaturized or mobile applications is reported
   here. Several-fold enhancements in coupled heat and mass transfer
   possible in microscale passages remove significant hurdles that have
   hindered the implementation of thermally activated heat pumps. Cooling
   capacities of 100 W-10 s of kW are possible through minor changes in
   component geometry. These mass-producible miniaturized systems can be
   packaged as monolithic full-system packages or as discrete, distributed
   hydronically coupled components integrated into buildings. A 300 W
   nominal cooling capacity ammonia-water absorption heat pump with overall
   dimensions of 200 x 200 x 34 mm and a mass of 7 kg was fabricated and
   tested over a range of heat sink temperatures from 20 to 35 degrees C
   with 500-800 W of desorber heat input to yield cooling duties of 136-300

Abstract = {{To fabricate low-cost hydrophilic and antifouling ultrafiltration
   membranes, in this work, we tuned the membrane surface hydrophilicity
   and porosity by adding different amounts of the amphiphilic copolymer
   (Pluronic F 127) into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casting solution. The
   modified PVC membrane characteristics including oxygen content,
   morphology and pore size, surface roughness, hydrophilicity, and
   permeability were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy
   (AFM), contact angle measurement, and flux measurements. With the
   increase of Pluronic F 127 content from 0 to 10 wt.\%, the oxygen
   content on the membrane surface increased and then reached an asymptote
   when 8 wt.\% or greater Pluronic F 127 was used; the pore size and the
   pore density both decreased; the membrane surface became more
   hydrophilic as indicated by the decreasing contact angles; and the flux
   declined by 30\% when Pluronic F127 reached 10 wt.\%. Overall, the
   modified PVC membrane exhibited excellent antifouling feature even with
   Pluronic F 127 as low as 2 wt.\%. Due to the membrane flux decline at 10
   wt.\% Pluronic F 127, the optimal addition of Pluronic F 127 was 8
   wt.\%, which maintained the antifouling feature and high flux. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We introduce a general framework to handle structured models (sparse and
   block-sparse with possibly overlapping blocks). We discuss new methods
   for their recovery from incomplete observation, corrupted with
   deterministic and stochastic noise, using block-l(1) regularization.
   While the current theory provides promising bounds for the recovery
   errors under a number of different, yet mostly hard to verify
   conditions, our emphasis is on verifiable conditions on the problem
   parameters (sensing matrix and the block structure) which guarantee
   accurate recovery. Verifiability of our conditions not only leads to
   efficiently computable bounds for the recovery error but also allows us
   to optimize these error bounds with respect to the method parameters,
   and therefore construct estimators with improved statistical properties.
   To justify our approach, we also provide an oracle inequality, which
   links the properties of the proposed recovery algorithms and the best
   estimation performance. Furthermore, utilizing these verifiable
   conditions, we develop a computationally cheap alternative to block-l(1)
   minimization, the non-Euclidean Block Matching Pursuit algorithm. We
   close by presenting a numerical study to investigate the effect of
   different block regularizations and demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed recoveries.}},

Abstract = {{An interactive hybrid evolutionary computation (IHC) process for MEMS
   design synthesis is described, which uses both human expertise and local

   more capable of approximating surfaces with varying volatility. Compared
   to the commonly used stationary Gaussian process model, the new
   predictor is numerically more stable and can more accurately approximate
   complex surfaces when the experimental design is sparse. In addition,
   the new model can also improve the prediction intervals by quantifying
   the change of local variability associated with the response. Advantages

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{474-492}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Water consumption is emerging as an important issue potentially
   influencing the composition of future urban transportation networks,
   especially as projected urban populations are expected to outpace water
   availability and as alternative fuels and vehicles are being implemented
   in such regions. National and State policies aimed at reducing
   dependence on imported fuels and energy can increase local production of
   fuels and energy, impacting demand on local water resources. This
   article details the development of a model-based assessment on water
   consumption and withdrawal pertaining to the use-phase of conventional
   and alternative transportation modes based on regional energy and fuel
   production. An extensive literature review details water consumption
   from fuel extraction, processing, and distribution as well as power
   plant operations. Using Model-Based Systems Engineering principles and
   the Systems Modeling Language, a multi-level, multi-modal framework was
   developed and applied to the Metro Atlanta transportation system
   consisting of conventional and alternative vehicles across varying
   conditions. According to the analysis, vehicles powered by locally
   produced biofuels and electricity (assuming average local grid mix for
   charging) consume more water than locally refined gasoline and
   CNG-powered vehicles. Improvements in power plant technologies,
   electricity generation (e.g., use of solar and wind versus hydro power)
   and vehicle efficiencies can reduce such water consumption
   significantly. Total water withdrawal for each vehicle and fuel is
   significantly greater than water consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Several physics-based seabed geoacoustic models (including the Biot
   theory) predict that compressional wave attenuation alpha(2) in sandy
   marine sediments approximately follows quadratic frequency dependence at
   low frequencies, i.e., a2 approximate to kf(n) (dB/m), n = 2. A recent
   paper on broadband geoacoustic inversions from low frequency (LF) field
   measurements, made at 20 locations around the world, has indicated that
   the frequency exponent of the effective sound attenuation n approximate
   to 1.80 in a frequency band of 50-1000 Hz {[}Zhou et al., J. Acoust.
   Soc. Am. 125, 2847-2866 (2009)]. Carey and Pierce hypothesize that the
   discrepancy is due to the inversion models' neglect of shear wave
   effects {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 124, EL271-EL277 (2008)]. The broadband
   geoacoustic inversions assume that the seabottom is an equivalent fluid
   and sound waves interact with the bottom at small grazing angles. The
   shear wave velocity and attenuation in the upper layer of ocean bottoms
   are estimated from the LF field-inverted effective bottom attenuations
   using a near-grazing bottom reflection expression for the equivalent
   fluid model, derived by Zhang and Tindle {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 98,
   3391-3396 (1995)]. The resultant shear wave velocity and attenuation are
   consistent with the SAX99 measurement at 25Hz and 1000 Hz. The results
   are helpful for the analysis of shear wave effects on long-range sound
   propagation in shallow water. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Title = {{Dependency Modeling and Model Management in Mechatronic Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mechatronic design is traditionally supported through domain-specific
   design activities throughout the product development process. The
   partitioning into domain-specific problems leads to a situation where
   product properties influence each other, hence giving rise to
   dependencies. These dependencies play a key role in the prediction of
   properties and, as a result, in the decision-making process. The
   important question is how to manage the dependencies for efficient and
   effective decision making? The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we
   investigate the nature of dependencies and study how to model them. The
   paper proposes appropriate terminology taking into account the synthesis
   and analysis nature of both the properties and the dependencies. This
   terminology will be the core of the new dependency modeling language.
   The concepts related to dependency modeling are then illustrated through
   a simple robot design example, where the creation and importance of a
   dependency model are explained. Second, we study practical approaches
   for consistency management and model management in the presence of
   dependencies. Six levels-of-detail in modeling dependencies are
   presented; emphasizing that modeling at a higher level-of-detail ensures
   that more inconsistencies are avoided. Available languages such as OMG
   SysML (TM) are evaluated for a possible creation of the dependency
   models leading toward executable dependency networks. However, at
   present, SysML does not provide sufficiently rich language constructs to
   model dependencies. Third, we compare our dependency modeling approach
   to other state-of-the-art approaches such as dependency modeling with a
   design structure matrix (DSM), and highlight the benefits of the
   terminology proposed in this paper. We aim to convince the reader that
   there is substantial value in modeling dependencies explicitly,
   especially to avoid inconsistencies, which is not the current state of
   practice. However, an overall value from dependency modeling can only be
   obtained if the cost of creating the dependency model is reasonable.
   Issues such as human interaction/effort and model management through
   product lifecycle management (PLM) are discussed. {[}DOI:

Title = {{Combining Mathematical Programming and SysML for Automated Component
   Sizing of Hydraulic Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a framework for automated component sizing to
   extend a designer's ability to evaluate a particular configuration
   during the architecture exploration phase of a design process. Component
   sizing is a hard problem to solve, both from a computational and
   modeling aspect. This is because of competing objectives, requirements
   from multiple disciplines, and the need to find a good solution quickly
   for the architecture being considered. In current approaches, designers
   rely on heuristics and iterate over the multiple objectives and
   requirements until a satisfactory solution is found. To improve on this
   state of practice, we introduce advances in the following two areas: (a)
   solving the problem efficiently so that all of the imposed requirements
   are satisfied simultaneously and the solution obtained is mathematically
   optimal and (b) modeling a component sizing problem in a manner that is
   convenient to designers. An acausal, algebraic, equation-based,
   declarative modeling approach using mathematical programming (GAMS) is
   taken to solve these problems more efficiently. The object management
   group systems modeling language (OMG SysML (TM)) is used to model
   component sizing problems in order to facilitate problem formulation,
   model reuse and automatic generation of low-level code that can be
   solved using GAMS and its solvers. This framework is demonstrated by
   applying it to an example of a hydraulic log splitter. Based on this
   initial example, we discuss two advantages of this framework-total time
   taken in solving multiple scenarios for a given configuration and the
   graphical representation of a problem in SysML. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Polynomial profiles can be used as reference commands to limit induced
   vibration in flexible systems. Due to their ease of design and low-pass
   filtering effects, polynomial profiles are often found in cam-follower
   systems. Polynomial profiles have also been used as smooth reference
   commands for automated machines. However, despite extensive work to
   develop and improve such profiles, inherent tradeoffs still exist
   between induced vibration, rise time, and ease of design. Input shaping
   is an alternative method for generating motion commands that reduce
   residual vibration. This paper compares polynomial profiles to
   input-shaped commands for the application of reducing vibration in
   flexible systems. Analyses using Laplace transforms reveal that input
   shapers suppress vibration at regularly spaced frequencies. However,
   polynomial profiles do not share this property. Simulations and
   experimental results show that input shaping improves rise time and
   reduces residual vibration in comparison to polynomial profiles. {[}DOI:

   relative to the rotating carrier plate on various frequency components
   in the vibration spectra is studied. The mathematical analysis is
   validated with experimental data comparing the vibration signature of
   helicopter transmissions operating either normally or with damage,
   leading to shifts in the planet gear positions. The theory presented is
   able to explain certain features and trends in the measured vibration
   signals of healthy and faulty transmissions. The characterization
   offered may serve as a means of detecting damage in planetary gear
   systems. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006651]}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes are highly conductive quasi-one dimensional structures
   that have been vigorously explored for many applications due to their
   unique properties. In many thermal and electrical applications where
   high conductivity is desired, both the carbon nanotubes and their growth
   substrate need to be as conductive as possible. However, carbon nanotube
   growth conditions limit many substrates from being applied due to the
   sensitivity of the transition metal catalyst from being poisoned or lost
   from intermetallic diffusion. These difficulties become further
   complicated with the incorporation of bulk metal substrates compared to
   more commonly used Si- or SiO2-based substrates. Despite this, there
   have been promising investigations of carbon nanotube growth on metals
   and a study summarizing recent advances has yet to be published. This
   review aims to fulfill this need and discuss current progress and
   challenges. Successful growth techniques and catalyst support layers are
   emphasized and it is observed that a better understanding of the
   microstructural evolution of catalyst and substrate is needed.}},

Abstract = {{We study the use of a BGaN back-barrier layer in the GaN buffer of
   AlyGa1-yN/GaN high-electron mobility transistors to improve confinement
   of carriers in the 2D electron gas region. Unlike InGaN back-barrier
   designs, whose polarization-induced sheet charges form an electrostatic
   barrier at the back-barrier/buffer interface, BGaN back-barrier designs
   create an electrostatic barrier at the channel/back-barrier interface.
   This can result in carrier confinement to sub-15 nm thickness, even when
   the channel is 30 nm wide. Although polarization sheet charges due to
   the BGaN back-barrier form a secondary well at the back-barrier/buffer
   interface, increasing the thickness of the back-barrier may move the
   secondary well so that it no longer interacts with the primary channel.}},

Abstract = {{Tongue drive system(TDS) is a tongue-operated, minimally invasive,
   unobtrusive, and wireless assistive technology (AT) that infers users'
   intentions by detecting their voluntary tongue motion and translating
   them into user-defined commands. Here we present the new intraoral
   version of the TDS (iTDS), which has been implemented in the form of a
   dental retainer. The iTDS system-on-a-chip (SoC) features a configurable
   analog front-end (AFE) that reads the magnetic field variations inside
   the mouth from four 3-axial magnetoresistive sensors located at four
   corners of the iTDS printed circuit board (PCB). A dual-band transmitter
   (Tx) on the same chip operates at 27 and 432 MHz in the
   Industrial/Scientific/Medical (ISM) band to allow users to switch in the
   presence of external interference. The Tx streams the digitized samples
   to a custom-designed TDS universal interface, built from commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which delivers the iTDS data to other
   devices such as smartphones, personal computers (PC), and powered
   wheelchairs (PWC). Another key block on the iTDS SoC is the power
   management integrated circuit (PMIC), which provides individually
   regulated and duty-cycled 1.8 V supplies for sensors, AFE, Tx, and
   digital control blocks. The PMIC also charges a 50 mAh Li-ion battery
   with constant current up to 4.2 V, and recovers data and clock to update
   its configuration register through a 13.56 MHz inductive link. The iTDS
   SoC has been implemented in a 0.5-mu m standard CMOS process and
   consumes 3.7 mW on average.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the design of an 800-MHz solar-powered active
   wireless beacon composed of an antenna and an integrated oscillator on a

   oscillator circuit is designed using off-the-shelf components mounted on
   the paper substrate. Flexible, low-cost, amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar
   cells are placed on top of the slot ground and provide autonomous
   operation of the active circuit eliminating the use of a battery. A
   prototype is built and characterized in terms of phase noise, radiation
   patterns, and the effect of solar irradiance. Such low-cost flexible
   circuits can find significant applications as beacon generator circuits
   for real-time identification and position purposes, wearable
   biomonitoring as well as solar-to-wireless power transfer topologies.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the synthesis of two new blue to transmissive
   donor-acceptor electrochromic polymers: a polymer synthesized using an
   alternating copolymerization route (ECP-Blue-A) and a polymer
   synthesized using a random copolymerization (ECP-Blue-R) by Stifle
   polymerization. These polymers utilize side chains with four ester
   groups per donor moiety, allowing organic solubility in the ester form,
   and water solubility upon saponification to their carboxylate salt form.
   We demonstrate that the saponified polymer salts of ECP-Blue-A and
   ECP-Blue-R (WS-ECP-Blue-A and WS-ECP-Blue-R) can be processed from
   aqueous solutions into thin films by spray-casting. Upon the subsequent
   neutralization of the thin films, the resulting polymer acid films are
   solvent resistant and can be electrochemically switched between their
   colored state and a transmissive state in a KNO3/water electrolyte
   solution. The polymer acids, WS-ECP-Blue-A-acid and WS-ECP-Blue-R-acid,
   show electrochromic contrast Delta\%T of 38\% at 655 nm and 39\% at 555
   nm for a 0.5 s switch, demonstrating the advantage of an aqueous
   compatible electrochrome switchable in high ionic conductivity aqueous
   electrolytes. The results of the electrodiromic properties study
   indicate that these polymers are promising candidates for aqueous
   processable and aqueous switching electrochromic materials and devices
   as desired for applications where environmental impact is of importance.}},

Abstract = {{Organic/inorganic multilayer barrier films play an important role in the
   semihermetic packaging of organic electronic devices. With the rise in
   use of flexible organic electronics, there exists the potential for
   mechanical failure due to the loss of adhesion/cohesion when exposed to
   harsh environmental operating conditions. Although barrier performance
   has been the predominant metric for evaluating these encapsulation
   films, interfacial adhesion between the organic/inorganic barrier films
   and factors that influence their mechanical strength and reliability has
   received little attention. In this work, we present the interfacial
   fracture toughness of a model organic/inorganic multilayer barrier
   (SiNx-PMMA). Data from four point bending (FPB) tests showed that
   adhesive failure occurred between the SiNx and PMMA, and that the
   adhesion increased from 4.8 to 10 J/m(2) by using a variety of chemical
   treatments to vary the surface energy at the interface. Moreover, the
   adhesion strength increased to 28 J/m(2) by creating strong covalent
   bonds at the interface. Overall, three factors were found to have the
   greatest impact on the interfacial fracture toughness which were (a)
   increasing the polar component of the surface energy, (b) creating
   strong covalent bonds at the organic/inorganic interface, and (c) by
   increasing the plastic zone size at the crack tip by increasing the
   thickness of the PMMA layer.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to develop a method for increasing the yield
   of multipotent adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) and
   osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs) from subcutaneous fat. After removing
   mature adipocytes and haematopoietic cells from rat inguinal fat, ASCs
   in the remaining cell population were verified by their attachment to
   plastic, surface marker profile (CD271+, CD73+ and CD45) and ability to
   differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. OPCs were
   defined as E11+ and OCN+. Adherent cells were cultured in growth medium
   (GM) or osteogenic medium (OM) and treated with resveratrol (0, 12.5,
   and 25 mu m) for 7?days; ASCs and OPCs were assessed by flow cytometry.
   Osteogenic potential was determined in two-dimensional (2D) cultures as
   a function of alkaline phosphatase-specific activity and osteocalcin
   production. In addition, cells were seeded onto three-dimensional (3D)
   poly-e-caprolactone scaffolds and cultured under dynamic conditions;
   mineralization was quantified by micro-CT at 4, 8 and 12?weeks.
   Resveratrol increased the percentage of ASCs in the population
   (population\%) and number of ASCs in both GM and OM, but increased only
   the number of OPCs in GM. In both media types resveratrol increased
   alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin levels. In 3D cultures,
   resveratrol-treated cells significantly increased mineralized matrix
   volume at early time points. Resveratrol exerted a biphasic effect on
   adherent cells by enriching the ASC and OPC populations and enhancing
   osteogenic differentiation. Resveratrol pretreatment induced more
   mineralization at earlier time points and represents a clinically viable
   technique for orthopaedic and dental applications for autologous stem
   cell therapy. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Quay cranes (QC) are key resources at container terminals, and the
   efficiency of QC operations is vital for terminal productivity. The Quay
   Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP) is to schedule the work activities for a
   set of cranes assigned to a single berthed vessel with the objective of
   minimizing the completion time of all container handling tasks. The
   problem is complicated by special characteristics of QC operations.
   Considering QC moving time and interference constraints, the concept of
   contiguous bay operations is proposed and a heuristic is developed to
   generate QC schedules with this feature. The heuristic is efficient and
   effective: it has polynomial computational complexity, and it produces
   schedules with a completion time objective bounded above by a small
   increment over the optimal completion time. Importantly, the heuristic
   guarantees that no quay cranes are idle due to interference. Numerical
   experiments demonstrate that the optimality gap is small for practical
   instances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) produces a collagen scar, altering the local
   microenvironment and impeding cardiac function. Cell therapy is a
   promising therapeutic option to replace the billions of myocytes lost
   following MI. Despite early successes, chronic function remains impaired
   and is likely a result of poor cellular retention, proliferation, and
   differentiation/maturation. While some efforts to deliver cells with
   scaffolds have attempted to address these shortcomings, they lack the
   natural cues required for optimal cell function. The goal of this study
   was to determine whether a naturally derived cardiac extracellular
   matrix (cECM) could enhance cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) function in
   vitro. CPCs were isolated via magnetic sorting of c-kit{*} cells and
   were grown on plates coated with either cECM or collagen I (Col). Our
   results show an increase in early cardiomyocyte markers on cECM compared
   with Col, as well as corresponding protein expression at a later time.
   CPCs show stronger serum-induced proliferation on cECM compared with
   Col, as well as increased resistance to apoptosis following serum
   starvation. Finally, a microfluidic adhesion assay demonstrated stronger
   adhesion of CPCs to cECM compared with Col. These data suggest that cECM
   may be optimal for CPC therapeutic delivery, as well as providing
   potential mechanisms to overcome the shortcomings of naked cell therapy.

Abstract = {{The widespread application of multimedia wireless services and
   requirements of ubiquitous access have triggered rapidly booming energy
   consumption at both the base station side and the user equipment (UE)
   side. Hence, energy-efficient design in wireless networks is very
   important and is becoming an inevitable trend. In this paper, we study
   the energy-efficient resource allocation in both downlink and uplink
   cellular networks with orthogonal frequency division multiple access
   (OFDMA). For the downlink transmission, the generalized energy
   efficiency (EE) is maximized while for the uplink case the minimum
   individual EE is maximized, both under certain prescribed per-UE
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. For both transmission scenarios,
   we first provide the optimal solution and then develop a suboptimal but
   low-complexity approach by exploring the inherent structure and property
   of the energy-efficient design. For the downlink case, by modifying the
   original problem, we also find a computationally efficient and
   numerically tractable upper bound on the EE, which indicates the
   performance limit and is demonstrated to be quite tight if the number of
   subcarriers is larger than that of UEs and motivates us to find a
   near-optimal approach relying on the quasiconcave relation between the
   modified EE and transmit power. Simulation results show that the
   energy-efficient design greatly improves EE compared with the
   conventional spectral-efficient design and the low-complexity suboptimal
   approaches can achieve a promising tradeoff between performance and
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The transmit-receive (T/R) operation of an ultra-thin organic antenna
   array is presented at a center frequency of 9.5 GHz. High transmit power
   is achieved while maintaining an ultra-low profile in a novel
   system-on-a-package scheme whereby 32 silicon-germanium (SiGe),
   transmit/receive integrated-circuit (TRIC) modules have been flip-chip
   bonded to the array board. Each SiGe TRIC drives a pair of slot-coupled
   microstrip patch antennas that form an 8 x 8 rectangular array, which is
   all packaged in an organic substrate stack of liquid crystal polymer and
   RT/Duroid 5880LZ. The organic package occupies an area of 30.5 cm x 25.4
   cm and has a total thickness of only 1.80 mm. The small-signal
   characterization of the array showed a G/T = -6.64 dB, and a measured
   receive gain of 20.1 dB with a variation of 0.7 dB over a 1-GHz
   bandwidth (BW). Finally, far-field large-signal experiments showed a
   measured effective isotropically radiated power of 47.1 dBm with a
   variation of 2.36 dB over the same BW, and without the aid of additional
   thermal management components.}},

Abstract = {{The single-event effect sensitivity of inverse-mode biased SiGe HBTs in
   both bulk and SOI technology platforms are investigated, for the first
   time, using digital circuits and stand-alone device test structures.
   Comparisons of heavy-ion broad beam data of shift register circuits
   constructed with forward-mode and inverse-mode biased SiGe HBTs from a
   first-generation, complementary SOI SiGe BiCMOS process, reveal an
   improvement in SEU mitigation for the inverse-mode shift register
   architecture. Full 3D TCAD simulations highlight the differences in
   transient current origination between forward and inverse-mode biased
   devices, illustrating the impact of doping profiles on ion-induced shunt
   duration. To extend the analysis to a bulk platform, new
   fourth-generation npn, SiGe HBTs were biased in both the forward and
   inverse-mode and irradiated at NRL using the two photon absorption
   measurement system. These measurements support the analysis of transient
   origination using 3D TCAD simulations. Furthermore, the isolation of the
   output terminal from the sensitive subcollector-substrate junction is
   experimentally demonstrated for the inverse-mode bias. Fully coupled
   mixed-mode simulations predict a significant reduction in sensitive area
   for inverse-mode shift registers built in a bulk SiGe platform.}},

Abstract = {{We present a wideband, low noise amplifier (LNA) implemented in a
   Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (SiGe HBT)

   achieves a peak gain of 17.5 dB at nominal bias and a peak OIP3 of 15.8
   dBm at 10 GHz at nominal bias. The noise figure (NF) of the LNA is
   4.5-8.1 dB across band, and it nominally consumes 4 mA from a 4 V
   supply. Samples were irradiated with 63.3 MeV protons to
   proton-equivalent doses ranging from 200 krad(Si) to 2 Mrad(Si). This
   LNA incorporates bias control ``tuning-knobs{''} to enable bias tuning
   to mitigate for RF performance loss due to total dose exposure and
   process variation in performance metrics. The effectiveness of the
   tuning ``knobs{''} to compensate for lost post-irradiated performance
   was investigated. It was found that the LNA performance can be restored
   with the use of the tuning knobs with a performance tuning algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient design of spectrum-sensing and power control plays a key role
   in maximizing the throughput of a cognitive radio (CR) network while
   protecting the PUs from undue interference. In this paper, we consider
   the problem of joint spectrum-sensing-duration design and power control
   in a point-to-point CR link. The objective of the proposed solution is
   to maximize the CR achievable throughput while keeping the CR
   interference to the primary user (PU) at or below a preset interference
   threshold. The joint spectrum-sensing design and power control is a
   non-convex optimization problem, hence, obtaining the optimal solution
   may not be always feasible. In this paper, we formulate the joint
   sensing-duration design and power control problem as a two-stage
   stochastic program with recourse. Afterward, we derive the formulas for
   the achievable throughput as a function of the sensing duration.
   Moreover, we investigate the effect of different levels of knowledge of
   the interference channel state information (CSI) on the achievable
   throughput and the optimal sensing duration.}},

Abstract = {{The high energy density self-healing metallized film pulse capacitor has
   been applied to all kinds of laser facilities for their power
   conditioning systems under several stress levels, such as 23kV, 30kV and
   35kV, whose reliability performance and maintenance costs are affected
   by the reliability of capacitors. Due to the costs and time restriction,
   how to assess the reliability of highly reliable capacitors under a
   certain stress level as soon as possible becomes a challenge.
   Accelerated degradation test provides a way to predict its lifetime and
   reliability effectively. A model called stress-lifetime joint
   distribution model and an analysis method based on accelerated
   degradation data of metallized film pulse capacitors are described in
   this paper. Also described is a method for estimating the distribution
   of time to failure. The estimators of the unknown parameters in the
   model are given respectively. Both the failure probability density
   function (pdf) and the cumulative distribution function (cdf) can be
   presented by the model. Based on these estimators and the pdf/cdf, the
   reliability model of metallized film pulse capacitors is obtained.
   According to the reliability model, the probability of capacitors under
   stress 23kV that survive to 20000 shots is presented. Then the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is performed to validate the model. The result
   shows that the reliability of capacitors under a certain stress level
   can be assessed as soon as possible by using the model, once the
   estimators of the unknown parameters in the model are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion instability is a major issue facing lean, premixed combustion
   approaches in modern gas turbine applications. This paper specifically
   focuses on instabilities that excite transverse acoustic modes of the
   combustion chamber. Recent simulation and experimental studies have
   shown that much of the flame response during transverse instabilities is
   due to the longitudinal fluid motions induced by the fluctuating
   pressure field above a nozzle. In this study, we analyze the
   multi-dimensional acoustic field excited by transverse acoustic
   disturbances interacting with an annular side branch, emulating a
   fuel/air mixing nozzle. Key findings of this work show that the
   resultant velocity fields are critically dependent upon the structure of
   the transverse acoustic field and the nozzle impedance. Significantly,
   we also show that certain cases can be understood from relatively simple
   quasi one-dimensional considerations, but that other cases are
   intrinsically three-dimensional.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of a general anisotropic
   multiphase microstructure, a modified version of statistical
   strong-contrast expansions is formulated here. The proposed method takes
   into account the shape, orientation, and distribution of each phase
   through two-point and three-point correlation functions. By applying a
   recently developed method, three-point correlation functions are
   approximated from the two-point correlation functions. Numerically, it
   is shown that for high contrast constituents, the solution of the
   third-order strong-contrast expansions is very sensitive to the
   selection of the reference medium. A technique is proposed to minimize
   the sensitivity of the solution. To establish the validity of the
   methods developed, the effective thermal conductivity of a number of
   isotropic and anisotropic two-phase and three-phase microstructures is
   evaluated and compared to their corresponding finite element (FE)
   simulations. Good agreement between the FE simulations and the proposed
   method predictions in the cases studied confirms its validity. When
   there are orders of magnitude disparity between the properties of the
   constituents, the developed method can be applied to better estimate the
   effective thermal conductivity of the multiphase heterogeneous materials
   in comparison with previous strong contrast model and other homogeneous
   methods. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Conventional pavements rely on stiff upper layers to spread traffic
   loads onto less rigid lower layers. In contrast, an inverted pavement
   system consists of an unbound aggregate base compacted on top of a stiff
   cement-treated base and covered by a relatively thin asphalt concrete
   layer. The unbound aggregate interlayer in an inverted pavement
   experiences high cyclic stresses that incite its inherently nonlinear
   granular media behavior. A physically sound, nonlinear elastoplastic
   material model is selected to capture the unbound granular base in a
   finite-element simulator developed to analyze the performance of
   inverted pavement structures. The simulation results show that an
   inverted pavement can deliver superior rutting resistance, as compared
   with a conventional flexible pavement structure with similar fatigue

Journal = {{LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS}},

Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1096-1112}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Quantification of the hydrodynamic disturbance of free-swimming
   zooplankton provides insight into propulsion as well as organism sensory
   interactions. Current flow measurement techniques, such as planar
   particle image velocimetry (PIV), are limited by their two-dimensional
   nature. These techniques also are challenged by the small spatial scale
   of zooplankton, by the high speeds achieved by many zooplankton species,
   and by zooplankton photosensitivity to a broad range of wavelengths. We
   present a high-speed tomographic PIV system using near-infrared laser
   illumination that is capable of measuring three-dimensional velocity
   vectors in a volume surrounding a plankter. This technique is assessed
   by recording and analyzing the time-resolved flow field created by a
   high-speed escape of a copepod (Calanus finmarchicus). Persistent body
   and wake vortices are created by the impulsive momentum transfer to the
   fluid surrounding the animal. It is shown that some aspects of this flow
   can be analytically modeled as an impulsive stresslet. Azimuthal
   asymmetry of the strength and position of the wake vortex is analyzed
   and attributed to the strong ventral flows created by the metachronally
   beating swimming legs. In addition, the energy required by a copepod
   escape jump is estimated by calculating the viscous energy dissipation
   rate using the spatial gradients of the measured three-dimensional
   velocity field. Finally, the challenges and benefits of the tomographic
   PIV technique are discussed.}},

   phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at room temperature for a period of over
   12 months. The USEA/INI-R5, while being soaked was powered and
   configured wirelessly through 2.765 MHz inductive link and the
   transmitted frequency shift keying (FSK) modulated radio-frequency (RF)
   (900 MHz industrial, scientific, medical-ISM band) signal was also
   recorded wirelessly as a function of soak time. In order to test the
   long term recording ability, in vitro wireless recording was performed
   in agarose for few channels. The full functionality and the ability of
   the electrodes to record artificial neural signals even after 12 months

Abstract = {{Polymer electrets, polymers with a quasi-permanent electrostatic
   polarization, are commonly employed in a macro-scale form factor within
   transducers such as the electret condenser microphone. In addition,
   MEMS-based electret transduction has been reported for both acoustic
   sensors and energy harvesters. In these micro-devices, the polymer film
   is typically polarized prior to assembly into the device. Common
   techniques employed in MEMS electret polarization include corona
   discharge and backlighted thyratron. with wafer-bonding and simple
   stacked assemblies being employed to perform the actual assembly and
   integration. In contrast, this paper reports a method for post-release
   in situ polarization of electret films within a MEMS device. The method
   utilizes microplasma discharges with self-aligned charging grids
   integrated within the device to charge fluoropolymer films in a fashion
   similar to the corona discharge technique. This in situ approach enables
   the integration of uncharged electret films into MEMS and subsequent
   post-fabrication charging, simultaneously enabling the formation of
   buried or encapsulated electrets as well as eliminating the need to
   restrict fabrication processes that might otherwise discharge
   pre-charged electret materials. The method is applied to a single-chip
   array of ultrasonic sensors designed to capture and analyze waveforms
   from impacts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Silica supported amine materials are promising compositions that can be
   used to effectively remove CO2 from large stationary sources, such as
   flue gas generated from coal-fired power plants (ca. 10?\% CO2) and
   potentially from ambient air (ca. 400 ppm CO2). The CO2 adsorption
   characteristics of prototypical poly(ethyleneimine)silica composite
   adsorbents can be significantly enhanced by altering the acid/base
   properties of the silica support by heteroatom incorporation into the
   silica matrix. In this study, an array of
   poly(ethyleneimine)-impregnated mesoporous silica SBA-15 materials
   containing heteroatoms (Al, Ti, Zr, and Ce) in their silica matrices are
   prepared and examined in adsorption experiments under conditions
   simulating flue gas (10?\% CO2 in Ar) and ambient air (400 ppm CO2 in
   Ar) to assess the effects of heteroatom incorporation on the CO2
   adsorption properties. The structure of the composite adsorbents,
   including local information concerning the state of the incorporated
   heteroatoms and the overall surface properties of the silicate supports,
   are investigated in detail to draw a relationship between the adsorbent
   structure and CO2 adsorption/desorption performance. The CO2
   adsorption/desorption kinetics are assessed by thermogravimetric
   analysis and in situ FT-IR measurements. These combined results, coupled
   with data on adsorbent regenerability, demonstrate a stabilizing effect
   of the heteroatoms on the poly(ethyleneimine), enhancing adsorbent
   capacity, adsorption kinetics, regenerability, and stability of the
   supported aminopolymers over continued cycling. It is suggested that the
   CO2 adsorption performance of silicaaminopolymer composites may be
   further enhanced in the future by more precisely tuning the acid/base
   properties of the support.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This article presents a systematic frame-work characterizing
   adaptive systems.
   Background: Adaptive systems are those that can appropriately modify
   their behavior to fit the current context. This concept is appealing
   because it offers the possibility of creating computer assistants that
   behave like good human assistants who can provide what is needed without
   being asked. However, the majority of adaptive systems have been
   experimental rather than practical because of the technical challenges
   in accurately perceiving and interpreting users' current cognitive
   state; integrating cognitive state, environment, and task information;
   and using it to predict users' current needs. The authors anticipate
   that recent developments in neurological and physiological sensors to
   identify users' cognitive state will increase interest in adaptive
   systems research and practice over the next few years.
   Method: To inform future efforts in adaptive systems, this work provides
   an organizing framework for characterizing adaptive systems, identifying
   considerations and implications, and suggesting future research issues.
   Results: A two-part framework is presented that (a) categorizes ways in
   which adaptive systems can modify their behavior and (b) characterizes
   trigger mechanisms through which adaptive systems can sense the current
   situation and decide how to adapt.
   Conclusion: The framework provided in this article provides a tool for
   organizing and informing past, present, and future research and
   development efforts in adaptive systems.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate how customers respond to an opaque airline product
   offered by a European carrier. In this opaque product design, customers
   are randomly assigned to travel to one of approximately ten
   destinations; however, for a fee they may exclude one or more
   destinations from the choice set (or a particular package design) prior
   to learning which destination they will travel to. We use a
   multidimensional binary logit model to predict the probability that one
   or more alternatives will be chosen by a customer. Results show that
   customers are more likely to pay to exclude destinations located close
   to the origin airport and destinations that speak the same language as
   the origin airport. Length of stay, cost of living at the destination,
   and measures of destination attractiveness are also found to be
   significant predictors for some package designs. Based on these
   findings, we offer general recommendations for how to design opaque
   packages for airline customers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The genomes of Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 and Anaeromyxobacter
   dehalogenans strain 2CP-C encode 40 and 69 putative c-type cytochrome
   genes respectively. Deletion mutant and biochemical studies have
   assigned specific functions to a few c-type cytochromes involved in
   electron transfer to oxidized metals in S. oneidensis strain MR-1.
   Although promising, the genetic approach is limited to gene deletions
   that produce a distinct phenotype and to an organism for which a genetic
   system is available. To investigate and compare c-type cytochrome
   expression in S. oneidensis strain MR-1 and Anaeromyxobacter
   dehalogenans strain 2CP-C more comprehensively, proteomic measurements
   were used to characterize lysates of cells grown with soluble Fe(III)
   (as ferric citrate) and insoluble Mn(IV) (as MnO2) as electron
   acceptors. Strain MR-1 expressed 19 and 20, and strain 2CP-C expressed
   27 and 25, c-type cytochromes when grown with Fe(III) and Mn(IV)
   respectively. The majority of c-type cytochromes (77\% for strain MR-1
   and 63\% for strain 2CP-C) were expressed under both growth conditions;
   however, the analysis also revealed unique c-type cytochromes that were
   specifically expressed in cells grown with soluble Fe(III) or insoluble
   Mn(IV). Proteomic characterization proved to be a promising approach for
   determining the c-type cytochrome complement expressed under different
   growth conditions, and will help to elucidate the specific functions of
   more c-type cytochromes that are the basis for Shewanella and
   Anaeromyxobacter respiratory versatility.}},

   double ECLs and single ECL with carrier suppression. Using this scheme,
   we successfully generate more than 95 frequency-locked subcarriers with
   15-GHz frequency spacing and TNR larger than 25.3 dB and 23.3 dB,

Abstract = {{We have developed a flexible thermoelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that is
   based on a Te-nanowire/poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) polymer composite
   as the thermoelectric material with a positive Seebeck coefficient of
   285 mu V/K. A linear relationship between the output voltage of TENG and
   the temperature difference across the device was observed. Under a
   temperature difference of 55 K, two TENGs can provide an output voltage
   of 38 mV in serial connection, or a current density exceeding 32
   nA/mm(2) in parallel connection. We demonstrated that the flexible TENG
   can be used as a wearable energy harvester by using human body
   temperature as the energy source. In addition, the TENG can also be used
   as a self-powered temperature sensor with a response time of 17 s and a
   reset time of 9 s. The detection sensitivity of the sensor can reach
   0.15 K in ambient atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Swimming microrobots are envisioned to impact minimally invasive
   diagnosis, localized treatment of diseases, and environmental
   monitoring. Dynamics of micro-scale swimming robots falls in the realm
   of low Reynolds number, where viscous forces exerted on the robots are
   dominant over inertia. Viscous forces developed at the interface of the
   swimming microrobots and the surrounding fluid are a strong function of
   the body geometry. In this work, a collection of bacteria-powered
   micro-robots (BacteriaBots) with prolate spheroid, barrel, and
   bullet-shaped bodies is fabricated and the influence of body shape on
   the dynamics of the BacteriaBots is investigated. We have experimentally
   demonstrated that using non-spherical geometries increases the mean
   directionality of the motion of the BacteriaBots but does not
   significantly affect their average speed compared with their spherical
   counterparts. We have also demonstrated that directionality of
   non-spherical BacteriaBots depends on the aspect ratio of the body and
   for the case of prolate spheroid, a higher aspect ratio of two led to a
   larger directionality compared to their low aspect ratio counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{While microdevices have shown a number of key advantages over similar
   macrosize sensors including size, cost, and sensitivity, a key challenge
   has centered on reducing drift and error due to changes in temperature.
   This paper proposes a novel substrate temperature compensation mechanism
   for micro-electromechanical systems double-ended tuning forks (DETFs).
   The device layer and substrate layer are purposefully made from
   differing materials. This mismatch induces thermal strains that cancel
   changes in the frequency due to a shift in the modulus of elasticity.
   Two polycrystalline silicon carbide DETFs of different physical
   dimensions are fabricated on single-crystalline silicon substrates. The
   devices are tested between 5 degrees C and 320 degrees C and exhibit
   temperature compensation as predicted by an analytical model. The DETFs
   exhibit peak temperature compensation near room temperature at 34
   degrees C and 38 degrees C, respectively. Over a commercial temperature
   range from 0 degrees C to 70 degrees C, the devices display temperature
   sensitivities of 1.5 Hz/degrees C (7.4 ppm/degrees C) and 0.3 Hz/degrees
   C (1.7 ppm/degrees C), which is up to 17 x better than a similar
   epitaxial silicon device. This work is broadly applicable to
   tuning-fork-based sensing systems such as strain gauges, pressure
   sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes. {[}2012-0034]}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting energy from our living environment is an effective approach
   for sustainable, maintenance-free, and green power source for wireless,
   portable, or implanted electronics. Mechanical energy scavenging based
   on triboelectric effect has been proven to be simple, cost-effective,
   and robust. However, its output is still insufficient for sustainably
   driving electronic devices/systems. Here, we demonstrated a rationally
   designed arch-shaped triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) by utilizing the
   contact electrification between a polymer thin film and a metal thin
   foil. The working mechanism of the TENG was studied by finite element
   simulation. The output voltage, current density, and energy volume
   density reached 230 V, 15.5 mu A/cm(2), and 128 mW/cm(3), respectively,
   and an energy conversion efficiency as high as 10-39\% has been
   demonstrated. The TENG was systematically studied and demonstrated as a
   sustainable power source that can not only drive instantaneous operation
   of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) but also charge a lithium ion battery as
   a regulated power module for powering a wireless sensor system and a

Abstract = {{Virtual modeling of cardiothoracic surgery is a new paradigm that allows
   for systematic exploration of various operative strategies and uses
   engineering principles to predict the optimal patient-specific plan.
   This study investigates the predictive accuracy of such methods for the
   surgical palliation of single ventricle heart defects. Computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD)-based surgical planning was used to model the
   Fontan procedure for four patients prior to surgery. The objective for
   each was to identify the operative strategy that best distributed
   hepatic blood flow to the pulmonary arteries. Post-operative magnetic
   resonance data were acquired to compare (via CFD) the post-operative
   hemodynamics with predictions. Despite variations in physiologic
   boundary conditions (e.g., cardiac output, venous flows) and the exact
   geometry of the surgical baffle, sufficient agreement was observed with
   respect to hepatic flow distribution (90\% confidence interval-14 +/- A
   4.3\% difference). There was also good agreement of flow-normalized
   energetic efficiency predictions (19 +/- A 4.8\% error). The hemodynamic
   outcomes of prospective patient-specific surgical planning of the Fontan

Abstract = {{Fluorescence tomography (FT) is depth-resolved three-dimensional (3D)
   localization and quantification of fluorescence distribution in
   biological tissue and entails a highly ill-conditioned problem as depth
   information must be extracted from boundary measurements.
   Conventionally, L-2 regularization schemes that penalize the Euclidean
   norm of the solution and possess smoothing effects are used for FT
   reconstruction. Oversmooth, continuous reconstructions lack
   high-frequency edge-type features of the original distribution and yield
   poor resolution. We propose an alternative regularization method for FT
   that penalizes the total variation (TV) norm of the solution to preserve
   sharp transitions in the reconstructed fluorescence map while overcoming
   ill-posedness. We have developed two iterative methods for fast 3D
   reconstruction in FT based on TV regularization inspired by
   Rudin-Osher-Fatemi and split Bregman algorithms. The performance of the
   proposed method is studied in a phantom-based experiment using a
   noncontact constant-wave trans-illumination FT system. It is observed
   that the proposed method performs better in resolving fluorescence
   inclusions at different depths. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a three-dimensional numerical model that solves the
   Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations on a curvilinear grid
   system using a novel nested grid approach. The main benefit of the model
   is the possibility to model locally complex hydraulic features in large
   rivers like the flow field at hydraulic structures. The entire study
   domain in such a case can be discretized with a coarser resolution,
   whereas a much finer resolution can be applied to a defined zone of the
   obstructions, where a detailed description of the flow field is needed.
   The model is tested on a laboratory experiment carried out at the
   Georgia Institute of Technology, where the flow field around a single
   and two double circular cylinders in a flatbed flume was studied.
   Simulated flow velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and bed shear stress
   distributions are in good agreement with measurements. However,
   deviations downstream of the piers indicate the limitation of the steady
   state description of the flow in the unstable wake zone. Nevertheless,
   the nested grid approach presented herein is a promising step towards
   the modeling of the local scouring phenomenon due to the relatively low
   computational demand.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of airborne particles to take up water may be enhanced by
   surface-active components, but the importance of this effect is
   controversial because direct measurement of the surface tension of
   microscopic droplets has not been possible. Here we infer droplet
   surface tension from water uptake measurements of mixed
   organic-inorganic particles at relative humidities just below saturation
   (99.3-99.9\%). The surface tension of droplets formed on particles
   composed of NaCl and a-pinene ozonolysis products was reduced by
   50-75\%, but only when enough organic material was present to form a
   film on the droplet surface at least 0.8 nm thick. This study suggests
   that if atmospheric particles are predominantly (greater than or similar
   to 80\%) composed of surface-active material, their influence on cloud
   properties and thus climate could be enhanced, and their atmospheric
   lifetimes could be reduced. Citation: Ruehl, C. R., P. Y. Chuang, A.

Abstract = {{Protective relay settings for wind turbine generators often depend on
   short-circuit calculations performed using sequence network circuits in

   the sequence network representation of induction machines result in some

   induction machines is derived in this paper to aid in short-circuit
   calculations in induction-generator-based wind plants. A rigorous
   mathematical approach to defining the stator short-circuit current
   equations under general faults is described and validated with transient
   simulations. The sequence network model of the induction machine is
   derived from the closed-form mathematical solutions. An example
   short-circuit calculation is performed on a simple network in this
   paper, and found to have a marked improvement in accuracy from
   traditional sequence network calculation methods for unbalanced faults.

Abstract = {{While the desired microstructure of the state-of-the-art Ni-YSZ anode
   for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based on YSZ is well known, the anode
   microstructure for a SOFC based on a proton conductor is yet to be
   optimized. In this study, we examined the effect of anode porosity on
   the performance of a SOFC based on BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.2O3-delta
   (BZCYYb), a mixed ion (proton and oxygen anion) conductor with high
   ionic conductivity at intermediate temperatures. Three cells with
   Ni-BZCYYb cermet anodes of different porosities (37\%, 42\%, and 50\%)
   and identical electrolytes and cathode components were fabricated and
   tested. Under typical fuel cell operating conditions, the cell with
   anode of the lowest porosity (37\%), prepared without pore former,
   achieved the highest performance, demonstrating a peak power density of
   1.2 W/cm(2) at 750 degrees C. This is radically different from the
   results of Ni-YSZ anodes for YSZ based cells, where high anode porosity
   (similar to 55\%) is necessary to achieve high performance. The observed
   increase in performance (or electrocatalytic activity for anode
   reactions) is attributed primarily to the unique microstructure of the
   anode fabricated without the use of pore forming precursors. Copyright

Title = {{Design Considerations for a Prosthetic Anterior Cruciate Ligament}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tearing is a common knee injury often
   requiring reconstruction with an autograft or an allograft. A prosthetic
   ligament replacement with off-the-shelf availability could potentially
   provide significant advantages over the current options for both
   patients and surgeons. Limitations of previous prosthetics include lack
   of biocompatibility and susceptibility to fatigue, creep, and failure of
   bony incorporation. This paper describes design considerations and
   possible improvements for the next generation prosthetic ACL. Design
   controls, as mandated by the FDA, are a systematic set of practices
   within the design and development process used to ensure that a new
   medical device meets the needs of the intended users. The specified
   requirements, called the design inputs, for a prosthetic ACL are
   discussed pertaining to material and structural properties, resistance
   to creep and fatigue, ability to support secure initial fixation,
   biocompatibility, and long-term osseointegration. Design innovations to
   satisfy the design inputs are discussed with regards to material
   selection, textile pattern, bone tunnel features, and short term
   fixation. A risk analysis is presented along with descriptions of
   proposed testing. Design control methodology and tissue engineering may
   be used to develop a next generation prosthetic ligament, solving
   multiple problems, simultaneously, on a holistic level, providing major
   improvements over earlier devices and current treatment options. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Complex formation between fullerenes and poly(para-phenylene ethynylene)
   (PPE) is studied through fluorescence quenching of PPE by C-60. The
   influence of side chain chemistry, particularly with respect to electron
   donating capability, and molecular weight on the complex strength is
   examined in detail. Fluorescence quenching measurements indicate complex
   formation on the order of 10(3)-10(4) dm(3)/mol, six orders of magnitude
   larger than previously studied C-60-small organic molecule complexes and
   an order of magnitude larger than C-60-cyclic polymer systems. No
   significant difference in complex strength was observed among PPEs with
   different side chain chemistry, indicating that C-60 interaction occurs
   largely with the conjugated PPE backbone. At the lower PPE molecular
   weights investigated, the association constant for complex formation
   remains constant: however, an increase is observed at the highest
   molecular weight studied. We attribute this increase to the C-60
   molecule quenching more than one PPE unit at once, resulting in enhanced
   quenching at higher molecular weights and larger association constant.
   Based on the strength of interaction and lack of side group contribution
   to the interaction, we conclude that pi-pi interactions between the C-60
   cage and PPE backbone are responsible for the comparatively strong
   interactions observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are concerned with a full-waveform-based methodology
   that allows the simultaneous imaging of the soil's stiffness and
   attenuating properties, using solely the soil's surficial response to
   probing waves.
   To date, field observations of small-strain wave attenuation in
   geomaterials at moderate spatial scales suggest that a commonly used
   metric of intrinsic and apparent attenuation, the seismic quality factor
   Q, is frequency-independent for a wide part of the frequency spectrum,
   including the frequency range of interest to seismic applications. We
   discuss first the forward simulation of waves in near-surface soil
   deposits directly in the time-domain using simplified models that
   adequately approximate nearly frequency-independent Q. To this end, we
   first review various attenuation models that aim at reproducing the
   frequency-independent Q behavior, and conclude, supported by site
   analyses, that, even though a generalized Maxwell body with eight
   Maxwell elements in parallel (GMB8) provides the best fit to
   frequency-independent Q we favor a version of it with fewer parameters
   (GMB2), in order to reduce modeling complexity, while still retaining
   good agreement with the GMB8 model.
   We report on forward site analyses that lend credence to the choice of
   the GMB2 simplified model. We, then, use the GMB2 constitutive relation
   in the context of full-waveform inversion, and report on numerical
   experiments that lead to the imaging of the soil's properties in
   heterogeneous semi-infinite domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Ensemble-trained source apportionment of fine particulate matter and
   method uncertainty analysis}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{387-394}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An ensemble-based approach is applied to better estimate source impacts
   on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and quantify uncertainties in various
   source apportionment (SA) methods. The approach combines source impacts
   from applications of four individual SA methods: three receptor-based
   models and one chemical transport model (CTM). Receptor models used are
   the chemical mass balance methods CMB-LGO (Chemical Mass
   Balance-Lipschitz global optimizer) and CMB-MM (molecular markers) as
   well as a factor analytic method, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF).
   The CTM used is the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. New
   source impact estimates and uncertainties in these estimates are
   calculated in a two-step process. First, an ensemble average is
   calculated for each source category using results from applying the four
   individual SA methods. The root mean square error (RMSE) between each
   method with respect to the average is calculated for each source
   category; the RMSE is then taken to be the updated uncertainty for each
   individual SA method. Second, these new uncertainties are used to
   re-estimate ensemble source impacts and uncertainties. The approach is
   applied to data from daily PM2.5 measurements at the Atlanta, GA,
   Jefferson Street (,JST) site in July 2001 and January 2002. The
   procedure provides updated uncertainties for the individual SA methods
   that are calculated in a consistent way across methods. Overall, the
   ensemble has lower relative uncertainties as compared to the individual
   SA methods. Calculated CMB-LGO uncertainties tend to decrease from
   initial estimates, while PMF and CMB-MM uncertainties increase.
   Estimated CMAQ source impact uncertainties are comparable to other SA
   methods for gasoline vehicles and SOC but are larger than other methods
   for other sources. In addition to providing improved estimates of source
   impact uncertainties, the ensemble estimates do not have unrealistic
   extremes as compared to individual SA methods and avoids zero impact
   days. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Anterior cruciate ligament fixation: Is radial force a predictor of the

Abstract = {{Background: In anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, an
   interference device achieves soft-tissue graft fixation by radially
   compressing the graft against the bone.
   Purpose: The objective of this study was to measure the radial force
   generated by different interference devices and evaluate the effect of
   this radial force on the pullout strength of graft-device constructs.
   Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
   Methods: A resultant force (F-R) was used as a representative measure of
   the total radial force generated. Bovine tendons were fixated in either
   synthetic bone or porcine tibia using one of following devices: (1) RCI
   titanium screw, (2) PEEK screw, (3) IntraFix sheath-and-screw device,
   and (4) ExoShape sheath-and-insert device. F-R was measured while each
   device was inserted into synthetic bone mounted on a test machine (n = 5
   for each device). In a subsequent test series, graft-device constructs
   were loaded to failure at 50 mm/min. The pullout strength was measured
   as the ultimate load before failure (n = 10 for each device).
   Results: The F-R values generated during insertion into synthetic bone
   were 777 +/- 86 N, 865 +/- 140 N, 1313 +/- 198 N, and 1780 +/- 255 N for
   the RCI screw, PEEK screw, IntraFix, and ExoShape, respectively. The
   pullout strengths in synthetic bone for the RCI screw, PEEK screw,
   IntraFix and ExoShape were 883 +/- 125 N, 716 +/- 249 N, 1147 +/- 142 N,
   and 1233 +/- 190 N, respectively.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the F-R generated during
   interference fixation affects the pullout strength with sheath-based
   devices providing superior F-R compared with interference screws. The
   use of synthetic bone was validated by comparing the pullout strengths
   to those when tested in porcine tibia.
   Clinical relevance: These results could be valuable to a surgeon when
   determining the best fixation device to use in the clinical setting. (C)

Abstract = {{The constitutive behavior of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
   unreinforced (control) and PET fibers reinforced with 5 wt\% vapor-grown
   carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) under uniaxial tension and subsequent to
   fatigue loading has been evaluated utilizing various analytical models.
   Two types of fatigue tests were performed: (1) Long cycle fatigue at 50
   Hz (glassy fatigue) to evaluate fatigue resistance and (2) fatigue at 5
   Hz (rubbery fatigue) to evaluate residual strength performance. The long
   cycle fatigue results at 50 Hz indicated that the PET-VGCNF sample
   exhibited an increased fatigue resistance of almost two orders of
   magnitude when compared to the PET unreinforced filament. The results of
   the fatigue tests at 5 Hz indicated that the constitutive response of
   both the PET control and PET-VGCNF samples changed subsequent to fatigue
   loading. The large deformation uniaxial constitutive response of the PET
   and PET-VGCNF fibers was modeled utilizing genetic-algorithm (GA) based
   training neural networks. The results showed that the large deformation
   uniaxial tension constitutive behavior of both PET unreinforced and
   PET-VGCNF samples with and without prior fatigue can be represented with
   good accuracy utilizing neural networks trained via genetic-based
   backpropagation algorithms, once the appropriate post-fatigue
   constitutive behavior is utilized. Experimental data of uniaxial tensile
   tests and experimental postfatigue constitutive data have been
   implemented into the networks for adequate training. The fatigue tests
   were conducted under tension-tension fatigue conditions with variations
   in the stress ratio (R), maximum stress (smax), number of cycles (N),
   and the residual creep strain (eR). POLYM. COMPOS., 2012. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We report on an optimization study of recombination layers in inverted
   tandem bulk heterojunction polymeric solar cells. Modification of
   bilayers of MoOx/Ag with a polymeric surface modifier, polyethylenimine
   ethoxylated (PEIE), is found to significantly improve the performance of
   these recombination layers. The improvement is assigned to a significant
   reduction by 1.5 eV of the work function of the Ag with PEIE. An
   analysis of the electrical, optical, and surface properties of the
   recombination trilayer is presented. Inverted tandem polymer solar
   cells, fabricated with two identical active layers comprising a donor
   polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a fullerene derivative
   acceptor. {[}6.6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM),
   provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the effectiveness of the
   MoOx/Ag/PEIE trilayer as recombination layer. Such tandem cells yield an
   open-circuit voltage of 1042 mV and fill factors of 0.62, comparable to
   those of single cells (0.63) under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm(2)

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was evaluation of an ice-free cryopreservation
   method for heart valves in an allogeneic juvenile pulmonary sheep
   implant model and comparison with traditionally frozen cryopreserved
   valves. Hearts of 15 crossbred Whiteface sheep were procured in
   Minnesota. The valves were processed in South Carolina and the pulmonary
   valves implanted orthotopically in 12 black faced Heidschnucke sheep in
   Germany. The ice-free cryopreserved valves were cryopreserved in 12.6
   mol/l cryoprotectant (4.65, 4.65, and 3.31 mol/l of dimethylsulfoxide,
   formamide and 1,2-propanediol) and stored at -80A degrees C. Frozen
   valves were cryopreserved by controlled slow rate freezing in 1.4 mol/l
   dimethylsulfoxide and stored in vapor-phase nitrogen. Aortic valve
   tissues were used to evaluate the impact of preservation without
   implantation. Multiphoton microscopy revealed reduced but not
   significantly damaged extracellular matrix before implantation in frozen
   valves compared with ice-free tissues. Viability assessment revealed
   significantly less metabolic activity in the ice-free valve leaflets and
   artery samples compared with frozen tissues (P < 0.05). After 3 and 6
   months in vivo valve function was determined by two-dimensional
   echo-Doppler and at 7 months the valves were explanted. Severe valvular
   stenosis with right heart failure was observed in recipients of frozen
   valves, the echo data revealed increased velocity and pressure gradients
   compared to ice-free valve recipients (P = 0.0403, P = 0.0591).
   Histo-pathology showed significantly thickened leaflets in the frozen
   valves (P < 0.05) and infiltrating CD3+ T-cells (P < 0.05) compared with
   ice-free valve leaflets. Multiphoton microscopy at explant revealed
   reduced inducible autofluorescence and extracellular matrix damage in
   the frozen explants and well preserved structures in the ice-free
   explant leaflets. In conclusion, ice-free cryopreservation of heart
   valve transplants at -80A degrees C avoids ice formation, tissue-glass
   cracking and preserves extracellular matrix integrity resulting in
   minimal inflammation and improved hemodynamics in allogeneic juvenile
   sheep.}},

Abstract = {{Surface structural modifications at the micrometer and nanometer scales
   have driven improved success rates of dental and orthopaedic implants by
   mimicking the hierarchical structure of bone. However, how initial
   osteoblast-lineage cells populating an implant surface respond to
   different hierarchical surface topographical cues remains to be
   elucidated, with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or immature
   osteoblasts as possible initial colonizers. Here we show that in the
   absence of any exogenous soluble factors, osteoblastic maturation of
   primary human osteoblasts (HOBs) but not osteoblastic differentiation of
   MSCs is strongly influenced by nanostructures superimposed onto a
   microrough Ti6Al4V (TiAlV) alloy. The sensitivity of osteoblasts to both
   surface microroughness and nanostructures led to a synergistic effect on
   maturation and local factor production. Osteoblastic differentiation of
   MSCs was sensitive to TiAlV surface microroughness with respect to
   production of differentiation markers, but no further enhancement was
   found when cultured on micro/nanostructured surfaces. Superposition of
   nanostructures to microroughened surfaces affected final MSC numbers and
   enhanced production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but the
   magnitude of the response was lower than for HOB cultures. Our results
   suggest that the differentiation state of osteoblast-lineage cells
   determines the recognition of surface nanostructures and subsequent cell
   response, which has implications for clinical evaluation of new implant
   surface nanomodifications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The trifluoromethanesulfonic (trflic) acid functionalized Zr-TMS
   materials were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD,
   N-2-sorption, elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, NH3-TPD, and C-13
   CP MAS NMR techniques. The samples with different loadings of triflic
   acid (TFA) over Zr-TMS (5-25 wt.\%) were synthesized. The acid density
   of TFA functionalised Zr-TMS (Zr-TMS-TFA) materials increased with
   loading of TFA from 5 through 25 wt.\%. The catalytic performance of
   Zr-TMS-TFA catalysts was evaluated in Michael addition of 3-methylindole
   to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones under liquid phase and solvent free
   reaction conditions. For example, the conversion of 3-methylindole
   increased with increasing loading of TFA from 38 through 87\%. The
   selectivity of C2-adduct compared to that of N-adduct also increased
   with increasing loading of TFA. The higher conversion was observed in
   the case of electron-withdrawing group containing indoles with higher
   selectivity of C-adduct. The catalysts were found to be reusable.

Abstract = {{The sparse coding hypothesis has generated significant interest in the
   computational and theoretical neuroscience communities, but there remain
   open questions about the exact quantitative form of the sparsity penalty
   and the implementation of such a coding rule in neurally plausible
   architectures. The main contribution of this work is to show that a wide
   variety of sparsity-based probabilistic inference problems proposed in
   the signal processing and statistics literatures can be implemented
   exactly in the common network architecture known as the locally
   competitive algorithm (LCA). Among the cost functions we examine are
   approximate l(p) norms (0 <= p <= 2), modified l(p)-norms, block-l(1)
   norms, and reweighted algorithms. Of particular interest is that we show
   significantly increased performance in reweighted l(1) algorithms by
   inferring all parameters jointly in a dynamical system rather than using
   an iterative approach native to digital computational architectures.}},

Abstract = {{This is a compact visual description of a combination of surgical

   considered critical for validating the combination of a surgical
   procedure, a device, and the safety of a final therapy for human use.
   The size, anatomy, and general vulnerability of the spine and spinal
   cord of the swine are recognized to better model the human. Moreover,
   the surgical process of exposing and manipulating the spinal cord as
   well as closing the wound in the pig is virtually indistinguishable from

Abstract = {{We present and compare three elastoplastic models currently used for

   Drucker-Prager model. The constitutive models are formulated in
   conjunction with the free volume theory for plastic deformation and are
   implemented numerically with finite element method. We show through a
   series of case studies that by considering explicitly the volume
   dilatation during plastic deformation, the Drucker-Prager model can
   produce the two salient features widely observed in experiments, namely,
   the strength differential effect and deviation of the shear band
   inclination angle under tension and compression, whereas the von Mises
   and modified von Mises models are unable to. We also explore shear band
   formation using the three constitutive models. Based on the study, we
   discuss the free volume theory and its possible limitations in the

Abstract = {{Graphene-enabled wireless communications constitute a novel paradigm
   which has been proposed to implement wireless communications among
   nanosystems. Indeed, graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas, or
   graphennas, just a few micrometers in size have been predicted to
   radiate electromagnetic waves at the terahertz band. In this work, the
   important role of the graphene conductivity in the characteristics of
   graphennas is analyzed, and their radiation performance both in
   transmission and reception is numerically studied. The resonance
   frequency of graphennas is calculated as a function of their length and
   width, both analytically and by simulation. Moreover, the influence of a
   dielectric substrate with a variable size, and the position of the patch
   with respect to the substrate is also evaluated. Further, important
   properties of graphene, such as its chemical potential or its relaxation
   time, are found to have a profound impact in the radiation properties of
   graphennas. Finally, the radiation pattern of a graphenna is compared to
   that of an equivalent metallic antenna. These results will prove useful
   for designers of future graphennas, which are expected to enable
   wireless communications among nanosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this coupled experimental and numerical study is to
   provide insight into the mean and turbulent flow fields within an array
   of fully submerged, isolated, immobile boulders. Our study showed that
   the velocity defect law performed well for describing the mean flow
   around the boulder within the array. A prerequisite, however, was to
   accurately estimate the spatial variability of u{*} around the boulder,
   which was achieved via the boundary characteristics method. The u{*}
   exhibited considerable spatial variability within the array and form
   roughness was shown to be up to 2 times larger than the skin roughness
   in the boulder near-wake region. Because the boulders bear a significant
   amount of the flow shear, the available bed shear stress for entrainment
   of the mobile sediment, tau (ols) , near the boulders was roughly 50\%
   lower than the ambient tau (ols) . The tau (ols) variability induced by
   the boulders could lead to a threefold overestimation of the sediment
   transport rate.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve repair across long gaps remains clinically challenging
   despite progress made with autograft transplantation. While scaffolds
   that present trophic factors and extracellular matrix molecules have
   been designed, matching the performance of autograft-induced repair has
   been challenging. In this study, we explored the effect of cytokine
   mediated `biasing' of macrophage phenotypes on Schwann cell (SC)
   migration and axonal regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Macrophage
   phenotype was successfully modulated by local delivery of either
   Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or Interleukin-4 (IL-4) within polymeric
   nerve guidance channels, polarizing them toward pro-inflammatory (M1) or
   pro-healing (M2a and M2c) phenotypes, respectively. The initial
   polarization of macrophages to M2a and M2c phenotype results in enhanced
   SC infiltration and substantially faster axonal growth in a
   critically-sized rat sciatic nerve gap model (15 mm). The ratio of
   pro-healing to pro-inflammatory population of macrophages
   (CD206+/CCR7+), defined as regenerative bias, demonstrates a linear
   relationship with the number of axons at the distal end of the nerve
   scaffolds. The present results clearly suggest that rather than the
   extent of macrophage presence, their specific phenotype at the site of
   injury regulates the regenerative outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general fault-tolerant event detection scheme that
   allows nodes to detect erroneous local decisions by leveraging the local
   decisions reported by their neighbors. This detection scheme can handle
   cases where nodes have different accuracy levels. The derived
   fault-tolerant estimator is proven to be optimal under the maximum a
   posteriori (MAP) criterion. An equivalent weighted voting scheme is also
   derived. Further, two new error models are derived to take into account
   the neighbor distance and the geographical distributions of the two
   decision quorums. These models are particularly suitable for detection
   applications where the event under consideration is highly localized.
   The fault-tolerant estimator is simulated using a network of 1,024 nodes
   deployed randomly in a square region and assigned random probabilities
   of failure. Several estimation schemes that allow nodes to learn their
   error rates continuously are developed. These error rates are used in
   the distributed estimation schemes to assign appropriate weights to the
   nodes in the voting scheme.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring the location of resources on large scale, congested, outdoor
   sites can be performed more efficiently with vision tracking, as this
   approach does not require any pre-tagging of resources. However, the
   greatest impediment to the use of vision tracking in this case is the
   lack of detection methods that are needed to automatically mark the
   resources of interest and initiate the tracking. This paper presents
   such a novel method for construction worker detection that localizes
   construction workers in video frames. The proposed method exploits
   motion, shape, and color cues to narrow down the detection regions to
   moving objects, people, and finally construction workers, respectively.
   The three cues are characterized by using background subtraction, the
   histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the HSV color histogram. The
   method has been tested on videos taken in various environments. The
   results demonstrate its suitability for automatic initialization of
   vision trackers. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{559-573}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vulnerability estimation as well as quantitative and qualitative
   assessment of the seismic risk to highway bridges is crucial in
   obtaining reliable estimates of the resilience of highway transportation
   systems. Although previous studies have evaluated the seismic response
   and fragility of various bridge classes common to the central and
   southeastern United States, there is very little research that explores
   the differences in performance of bridge classes built with and without
   seismic detailing. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the
   influence of seismic detailing of four multispan bridge classes on the
   seismic performance, as well as the failure probability through the
   development and comparison of fragility curves. The primary differences
   between seismically and non-seismically designed bridges are the column
   reinforcement details and bridge bearings. Component and system
   fragility curves are developed to provide insight into the difference in
   performance of non-seismically and seismically designed bridges and are
   compared with those currently found in HAZUS-MH. Confidence bounds are
   finally developed to characterize the uncertainty about the proposed
   median fragility curves for the bridge classes. Bridge classes with
   seismic provisions incorporated in their design tend to have reduced
   confidence bandwidth at higher damage states. Significant improvement in
   performance is seen in all bridge classes considered in this study when
   seismic design and details are used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Metamodel-based regional vulnerability estimate of irregular steel
   moment-frame structures subjected to earthquake events}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{585-597}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rapid seismic vulnerability assessment tools for use with existing
   structures not only help in quantifying their susceptibility to
   structural failure, but also aid decision makers with regional portfolio
   earthquake risk mitigation. Steel moment-frame structures are a common
   structure type in the United States, and most research to date on their
   regional assessment has focused on the fragility analysis of structures
   with regular configurations. Given the large number of irregular
   structures in use in seismically active zones, the effect of plan-form
   irregularity on the fragility of moment-frame structures should be
   examined. The focus of this study is to estimate structural fragilities
   for the class of L-shaped steel moment-frame (LSMF) structures in the
   Central United States. As part of the assessment process, L-shaped
   plan-forms that are most common in the region are first selected based
   upon input from structural and architectural experts. Significant
   parameters affecting the LSMF seismic responses are identified from
   sensitivity studies using finite element models and
   design-of-experiments methods to construct response surface metamodels
   (RSMs). Portfolio-level fragility curves for LSMF structures are
   generated from the RSMs joined with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to
   treat regional uncertainty. RSM-based fragility curves are also compared
   with fragilities from HAzards US Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH). Furthermore, a
   fragility-based parametric study is performed to evaluate the effect of
   significant parameters on LSMF susceptibility. Findings indicate the
   extent to which different irregularity parameters such as first floor
   height and eccentricity impact regional LSMF vulnerability. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Density of electrochemically active triple phase boundary sites is one
   of the most important factors that affect the performance of composite
   cathodes in Solid oxide fuel cells. Only the topologically connected
   triple phase boundaries can become electrochemically active. Therefore,
   microstructure-based geometric modeling of topologically connected
   triple phase boundaries is of interest. In this contribution,
   three-dimensional microstructure simulations are utilized to predict the
   topological connectivity of the triple phase boundaries in a composite
   SOFC cathode as a function of the volume fractions of the constituents,
   particle size, shape, and the thickness of the cathode. The simulations
   show that the volume fractions of the constituent phases and electrode
   thickness are the most important factors that affect the topological
   connectivity. The simulations also reveal the geometric conditions under
   which most of the triple phase boundaries are topologically connected,
   so that for such SOFC cathode microstructures, the existing models for
   total geometric triple phase boundary length density can be also used to
   approximate the length density of the topologically connected triple
   phase boundaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many large-scale multi-agent missions consist of a sequence of subtasks,
   each of which can be accomplished separately by having agents execute
   appropriate decentralized controllers. However, many decentralized
   controllers have network topological prerequisites that must be
   satisfied in order to achieve the desired effect on a system. Therefore,
   one cannot always hope to accomplish the original mission by having
   agents naively switch through executing the controllers for each
   subtask. This paper extends the Graph Process Specification (GPS)
   framework, which was presented in previous work as a way to script
   decentralized control sequences for agents, while ensuring that network
   topological requirements are satisfied when each controller in the
   sequence is executed. Atoms, the fundamental building blocks in GPS,
   each explicitly state a network topological transition. Moreover, they
   specify the means to make that transition occur by providing a
   multi-agent controller, as well as a way to locally detect the
   transition. Scripting a control sequence in GPS therefore reduces to
   selecting a sequence of atoms from a library to satisfy network
   topological requirements, and specifying interrupt conditions for
   switching. As an example of how to construct an atom library, the
   optimal decentralization algorithm is used to generate atoms for agents
   to track desired multi-agent motions with when the network topology is
   static. The paper concludes with a simulation of agents performing a
   drumline-inspired dance using decentralized controllers generated by
   optimal decentralization and scripted using GPS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and development of robotic tweezers with
   a force-and displacement-sensing capability driven by piezoelectric
   stack actuators. In order to satisfy sufficient stroke and tip force for
   future medical operations, a rhombus strain amplification mechanism is
   adopted. One of the serially connected piezoelectric stack actuators
   nested in the end effector is used as a force sensor. The
   force-displacement characteristics at the outermost layer with respect
   to the forces of the innermost PZT actuators (i.e., forward model) is
   obtained from a lumped parameter model of the rhombus strain
   amplification mechanism and a Bernoulli-Euler beam model of the
   tweezer-style end effector. The end-effector tip force and displacement
   are measured using an inverse model of the nested multilayer structure
   relating these quantities to an induced voltage across the innermost PZT
   actuator. The prototype end effector has the size of 69 mm (length) x 14
   mm (height) x 13 mm (width). The performance test shows that the
   prototype has 1.0-N force and 8.8-mm displacement at the tip. The
   sensing accuracy was also evaluated through experiments. The
   experimental results show that the prototype has mean error of 0.086 N
   for force and 0.39 mm for displacement, which are equivalent to 11\% of
   their maximum measurable values.}},

Abstract = {{Coriolis mass flowmeters (CMFs) have been widely used in industry
   because of its high precision (up to 0.1\% on flow rig). A precondition
   to ensure the excellent performance of a CMF is that its measuring tube
   must vibrate with proper amplitude under different operating conditions.
   It is thus necessary to modify the driving force of its electromagnetic
   actuator (EMA), which however cannot be measured directly by means of a
   traditional force sensor. This paper presents an analytical model for
   calculating the EMA force of a CMF providing a means to predict some
   parametric effects on its performance. Specifically, the analytical
   model of a curved-tube CMF has been derived in closed forms for
   reconstructing the magnetic field from measured boundary conditions, and
   for calculating the Lorentz force of a permanent-magnet (PM)-based EMA
   in this paper. This novel coupled measurement-calculation approach,
   which relaxes the assumption of known magnetic property of the PM, has
   been validated through a series of experiments and applied to actual CMF
   offering insightful findings for designing EMA in CMF applications. Two
   sets of results are presented. The first set investigates the effect of
   two different loads on the vibration amplitude. The second set reveals
   the influence of vibration amplitudes on the Lorentz force of the EMA.}},

Abstract = {{Acute myocardial infarction (MI) caused by ischemia and reperfusion (IR)
   is the most common cause of cardiac dysfunction due to local cell death
   and a temporally regulated inflammatory response. Current therapeutics
   are limited by delivery vehicles that do not address spatial and
   temporal aspects of healing. The aim of this study was to engineer
   biotherapeutic delivery materials to harness endogenous cell repair to
   enhance myocardial repair and function. We have previously engineered
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels to present cell adhesive
   motifs and deliver VEGF to promote vascularization in vivo. In the
   current study, bioactive hydrogels with a protease-degradable
   crosslinker were loaded with hepatocyte and vascular endothelial growth
   factors (HGF and VEGF, respectively) and delivered to the infarcted
   myocardium of rats. Release of both growth factors was accelerated in
   the presence of collagenase due to hydrogel degradation. When delivered
   to the border zones following ischemia-reperfusion injury, there was no
   acute effect on cardiac function as measured by echocardiography. Over
   time there was a significant increase in angiogenesis, stem cell
   recruitment, and a decrease in fibrosis in the dual growth factor
   delivery group that was significant compared with single growth factor
   therapy. This led to an improvement in chronic function as measured by
   both invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography. These data demonstrate
   that dual growth factor release of HGF and VEGF from a bioactive
   hydrogel has the capacity to significantly improve cardiac remodeling
   and function following IR injury.}},

Abstract = {{A proof of concept study for a new type of carbon capture system is
   considered for post-combustion CO2 capture based on porous hollow fiber
   sorbents with ionic liquids sorbed in the cell walls of the fiber. This
   study proves that delicate morphological features in the open-celled
   porous wall can be maintained during the infusion process. Mixtures of
   task specific ionic liquid (i.e. {[}BMIM]{[}Tf2N]) and superbase (i.e.
   DBU) were loaded into polyamide-imide (PAI) fibers by a so-called
   two-step non-solvent infusion protocol. In the protocol, methanol
   carries ionic liquids into the pore cell walls of hollow fibers and then
   hexane carries superbase to create an efficient CO2 sorbent. Our ionic
   liquid/superbase impregnation technique overcomes a serious increase in
   mass transfer resistance upon reaction with CO2, thereby allowing its
   large scale utilization for post-combustion CO2 capture. The
   investigation on the effect of different pore former additives
   (different molecular weights of polyvinylpyrrolidone, lithium nitrate,
   and their mixtures) suggested that a large molecular weight of PVP (M-w;
   1300k) including dope composition produces highly interconnected open
   cell pore structures of PAI hollow fibers. Lastly, a lumen side barrier
   layer was successfully formed on the bore side of neat PAI fibers by
   using a mixture of Neoprene (R) with crosslinking agents (TSR-633) via a
   post-treatment process. The lumen layer will enable heat removal from
   the fiber sorbents during their application in rapid thermal swing
   cycling processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   characteristics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{432}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions, and subsequently, marine communities, may be
   controlled by the hydrodynamics of the fluid flow in which the organisms
   live. This study looked at the pumping behavior of the bivalve clam,
   Mercenaria mercenaria, and how clams may use ambient and jet
   hydrodynamics to control the information available to their tracking
   predators. Specifically, this study quantified the velocity of the
   excurrent jet of actively pumping clams in the presence and absence of
   predator chemical cues under several ambient crossflow velocities using
   particle image velocimetry (PIV). Clams were found to increase the
   standard deviation values of the jet velocity fluctuations and to
   increase the randomness (as measured by fractal dimension) of the
   velocity values when predator chemical cues were present in the flow.
   The increased standard deviation of the jet velocity fluctuations, when
   a predator was present upstream, corresponded to increasing the
   energetic cost of pumping by approximately five times. However,
   increasing the randomness of the velocity values (as measured by the
   fractal dimension) did not appear to be more energetically costly. The
   changes seen here in the fluctuating characteristics of the clam
   excurrent jet are likely to promote the mixing of clam chemical
   metabolites by controlling the chemical source characteristics, which
   suggests that the behavior may be a means of predator avoidance.

Abstract = {{Place-modulated activity among neurons in the hippocampal formation
   presents a means to organize contextual information in the service of
   memory formation and recall(1,2). One particular spatial representation,
   that of grid cells, has been observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of
   rats and bats(3-5), but has yet to be described in single units in
   primates. Here we examined spatial representations in the EC of
   head-fixed monkeys performing a free-viewing visual memory task(6,7).
   Individual neurons were identified in the primate EC that emitted action
   potentials when the monkey fixated multiple discrete locations in the
   visual field in each of many sequentially presented complex images.
   These firing fields possessed spatial periodicity similar to a
   triangular tiling with a corresponding well-defined hexagonal structure
   in the spatial auto-correlation. Further, these neurons showed
   theta-band oscillatory activity and changing spatial scale as a function
   of distance from the rhinal sulcus, which is consistent with previous
   findings in rodents(4,8-10). These spatial representations may provide a
   framework to anchor the encoding of stimulus content in a complex visual
   scene. Together, our results provide a direct demonstration of grid
   cells in the primate and suggest that EC neurons encode space during
   visual exploration, even without locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses molecular dynamics (MID) modeling to examine the
   interlayer microstructures of montmorillonite intercalated with single
   chain QACs. Three types of QACs-tetramethylammonium (TMA),
   decyltrimethylammonium (DTMA), and hexadecyltrimethylammonium
   (HDTMA)-were selected to synthesize the organoclay complex, and the
   surfactant arrangement was analyzed quantitatively in systems in the
   absence of water. A series of arrangement patterns of interlayer QAC
   surfactant were observed, including lateral monolayers, lateral
   bilayers, pseudotrilayers, and paraffin monolayers, in agreement with
   previous experimental results. The effects of increasing one carbon
   chain length and amount of loading of QAC on the resultant QAC
   arrangement are summarized, yielding a model that provides insight into
   the prediction of synthesized QAC-clay microstructure and engineering
   behavior in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural and industrial practices more than doubled the intrinsic
   rate of terrestrial N fixation over the past century with drastic
   consequences, including increased atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O)
   concentrations. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and contributor to ozone
   layer destruction, and its release from fixed N is almost entirely
   controlled by microbial activities. Mitigation of N2O emissions to the
   atmosphere has been attributed exclusively to denitrifiers possessing
   NosZ, the enzyme system catalyzing N2O to N-2 reduction. We demonstrate
   that diverse microbial taxa possess divergent nos clusters with genes
   that are related yet evolutionarily distinct from the typical nos genes
   of denitirifers. nos clusters with atypical nosZ occur in Bacteria and
   Archaea that denitrify (44\% of genomes), do not possess other
   denitrification genes (56\%), or perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction
   to ammonium(DNRA; (31\%). Experiments with the DNRA soil bacterium
   Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans demonstrated that the atypical NosZ is an
   effective N2O reductase, and PCR-based surveys suggested that atypical
   nosZ are abundant in terrestrial environments. Bioinformatic analyses
   revealed that atypical nos clusters possess distinctive regulatory and
   functional components (e. g., Sec vs. Tat secretion pathway in typical
   nos), and that previous nosZ-targeted PCR primers do not capture the
   atypical nosZ diversity. Collectively, our results suggest that
   nondenitrifying populations with a broad range of metabolisms and
   habitats are potentially significant contributors to N2O consumption.
   Apparently, a large, previously unrecognized group of environmental nosZ
   has not been accounted for, and characterizing their contributions to
   N2O consumption will advance understanding of the ecological controls on
   N2O emissions and lead to refined greenhouse gas flux models.}},

Abstract = {{The instabilities and transitions of flow in a vertical cylindrical
   cavity with heated bottom, cooled top and insulated sidewall are
   investigated by linear stability analysis. The stability boundaries for
   the axisymmetric flow are derived for Prandtl numbers from 0.02 to 1,
   for aspect ratio A (A = H/R = height/radius) equal to 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7,
   respectively. We found that there still exists stable non-trivial
   axisymmetric flow beyond the second bifurcation in certain ranges of
   Prandtl number for A D 1, 0 : 9 and 0.8, excluding the A = 0.7 case. The
   finding for A = 0.7 is that very frequent changes of critical mode
   (azimuthal Fourier mode) of the second bifurcation occur when the
   Prandtl number is changed, where five kinds of steady modes m = 1, 2, 8,
   9, 10 and three kinds of oscillatory modes m = 3, 4, 6 are presented.
   These multiple modes indicate different flow structures triggered at the
   transitions. The instability mechanism of the flow is explained by
   kinetic energy transfer analysis, which shows that the radial or axial
   shear of base flow combined with buoyancy mechanism leads to the
   instability results.}},

Abstract = {{Presented is a circuit implementation for the discrete-time zigzag map,
   which exhibits high speed, low power consumption, and above all
   resilience to process variations. Circuit parameter variations result in
   alteration of the chaotic map parameters, such as the slope and the
   location of the breakpoints in the map, which in turn degrade the
   randomness of the generated bit sequence or even cause the saturation
   problem when the map is used in a truly random number generator (TRNG).
   Because of the resilience of the presented circuit implementation to
   process variations, a truly random sequence is obtained that passes all
   the TRNG statistical test suites, after very simple post-processing of
   the output bit sequence.}},

Abstract = {{The packed bed heat and mass transfer,dynamics of CO2 adsorption onto a

   and mass transfer models in Conjunction with the linear driving force
   rate model are Used to simulate the concentration and temperature
   profiles in the bed. The heat and mass transfer processes in the amine
   adsorbent packed bed are successfully captured by the model, and
   comparison of isothermal and nonisothermal models reveals that
   isothermal models provide an accurate description of the dynamic mass
   transport behavior in the adsorption column under the experimental
   conditions used in this study. The results help establish that under
   certain experimental conditions, heat effects in amine adsorbent packed
   beds have a negligible effect on CO2 breakthrough, and simple isothermal

Abstract = {{Packed bed breakthrough experiments are reported for commercial zeolite
   13X and 3-aminopropyl-functionalized SBA-15 silica Materials with three
   different amine loadings. Mass and heat transfer dynamics for all four
   materials are modeled successfully. Amine adsorbents With open pores are
   found to exhibit faster mass diffusion rate's compared to zeolite 13X.
   When. amine loading is increased by coupling aminopropyl groups,
   premature break through, Combined with a long tail is observed. Contrary
   to conventional physisorbants, finite heat losses to the column wall do
   not explain the long breakthrough tail. A rate model that accounts for
   heterogeneity in diffusion was found to accurately capture:the
   breakthrough shape of the high loading material. Batch uptake
   measurements support the hypothesis that slow diffusion through the
   Polymer phase is what hampers adsorption kinetics in the high amine
   loading adsorbent. The results emphasize the importance of designing
   materials that are not overloaded with amine sites, as excessive amine
   loadings can lead to depressed adsorption kinetics and premature column
   breakthrough.}},

Abstract = {{Solvent additives provide an effective means to alter the morphology and
   thereby improve the performance of organic bulk-heterojunction
   photovoltaics, although guidelines for selecting an appropriate solvent
   additive remain relatively unclear. Here, a family of solvent additives
   spanning a wide range of Hansen solubility parameters is applied to a
   molecular bulk-heterojunction system consisting of an isoindigo and
   thiophene containing oligomer as the electron donor and
   {[}6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the electron
   acceptor. Hansen solubility parameters are calculated using the group
   contribution method and compared with the measured solubilities for use
   as a screening method in solvent additive selection. The additives are
   shown to alter the morphologies in a semipredictable manner, with the
   poorer solvents generally resulting in decreased domain sizes, increased
   hole mobilities, and improved photovoltaic performance. The additives
   with larger hydrogen bonding parameters, namely triethylene glycol (TEG)
   and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), are demonstrated to increase the open
   circuit voltage by similar to 0.2 V. Combining a solvent additive
   observed to increase short circuit current, poly(dimethylsiloxane), with
   TEG results in an increase in power conversion efficiency from 1.4 to
   3.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Upconversion photoluminescence (UC) occurs in optical materials that are
   capable of absorbing low energy photons and emitting photons of higher
   energy and shorter wavelength, while downconversion (DC) materials may
   absorb one high energy photon and emit two of lower energy for quantum
   yields exceeding unity. These wavelength conversion processes allow us
   to transform electromagnetic radiation so it may be more effectively
   utilized by light-capturing devices and materials. Progress in designing
   more efficient organic and inorganic photochemical conversion systems
   has initiated a recent surge in attempts to apply these processes for
   practical uses, including enhancement of many energy and environmental
   technologies. In this review, we introduce important concepts in UC and
   DC materials and discuss the current status and challenges toward the
   application of wavelength conversion to solar cells, photocatalysis, and
   antimicrobial surfaces.}},

Title = {{Hydrodynamic modulation of pluripotent stem cells}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Controlled expansion and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells
   (PSCs) using reproducible, high-throughput methods could accelerate stem
   cell research for clinical therapies. Hydrodynamic culture systems for
   PSCs are increasingly being used for high-throughput studies and
   scale-up purposes; however, hydrodynamic cultures expose PSCs to complex
   physical and chemical environments that include spatially and temporally
   modulated fluid shear stresses and heterogeneous mass transport.
   Furthermore, the effects of fluid flow on PSCs cannot easily be
   attributed to any single environmental parameter since the cellular
   processes regulating self-renewal and differentiation are interconnected
   and the complex physical and chemical parameters associated with fluid
   flow are thus difficult to independently isolate. Regardless of the
   challenges posed by characterizing fluid dynamic properties,
   hydrodynamic culture systems off er several advantages over traditional
   static culture, including increased mass transfer and reduced cell
   handling. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of
   hydrodynamic culture environments for the expansion and differentiation
   of PSCs in microfluidic systems and larger-volume suspension
   bioreactors. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the effects of
   hydrodynamics on the self-renewal and differentiation of PSCs could
   yield improved bioprocessing technologies to attain scalable PSC culture
   strategies that will probably be requisite for the development of
   therapeutic and diagnostic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of damage on waves propagating in complex geometry
   waveguides is investigated through a numerical model formulated by
   combining the Spectral Finite Element Method and Perturbation
   Techniques. The resulting numerical tool allows efficient computation of
   the wave propagation response and the analysis of the effects of damages
   of various extent and location. The dynamic behavior of the damaged
   waveguides is described through a general higher order model which
   couples different waves thus allowing the prediction of mode conversion
   phenomena. Arbitrary cross-section can be considered through Finite
   Element (FE) discretization according to well-established
   Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) procedures. Two types of damages
   which allow the application of perturbation theory are considered: a
   small localized reduction of the thickness and a reduction of material
   stiffness and density. A validation by comparison with a Finite Element
   Model as well as numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
   model capabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by the dynamic
   interactions between the kinetochore and spindle microtubules. Our
   recent study shows that mitotic motor CENP-E cooperates with SKAP to
   orchestrate an accurate chromosome movement in mitosis. However, it
   remains elusive how kinetochore core microtubule binding activity KMN
   (KNL1-MIS12-NDC80) regulates microtubule plus-end dynamics. Here, we
   identify a novel interaction between MIS13 and SKAP that orchestrates
   accurate interaction between kinetochore and dynamic spindle
   microtubules. SKAP physically interacts with MIS13 and specifies
   kinetochore localization of SKAP. Suppression of MIS13 by small
   interfering RNA abrogates the kinetochore localization of SKAP. Total
   internal reflection fluorescence microscopic assays demonstrate that
   SKAP exhibits an EB1-dependent, microtubule plus-end loading and

Abstract = {{The intrinsic electrical properties of individual single-crystalline tin
   dioxide nanobelts, synthesized via catalyst-free physical vapor
   deposition, were studied and correlated to the surface oxygen deficiency
   with the presence of various ambient gases, especially hydrogen.
   Four-terminal field-effect transistor (FET) devices based on individual
   SnO2 nanobelts were fabricated with SiO2/Si as back gate and RuO2/Au as
   contacts. Four-probe I-V measurements verify channel-limited transistor
   characteristics and ensure that the hydrogen gas sensing reflect
   electrical modification of the nanobelt channel. The demonstrated
   results of the intrinsic SnO2 nanobelt based hydrogen sensor operating
   at room temperature provide useful information on the synthesis of room
   temperature chemo-resistive gas sensors with good sensitivity and
   stability. To evaluate the impact of surface gas composition on the
   electrical properties of SnO2 nanobelts, their temperature-dependent
   resistivity (rho), effective carrier mobility (mu(eff)) and effective
   carrier concentration (n(e)) were determined under different oxygen
   concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel 60-GHz wireless-over-fiber (WoF) access system for
   multigigabit bidirectional data transmission. In conventional microwave
   wireless system designs, electrical local oscillator (LO) sources are
   required for frequency conversions in both base station (BS) and mobile
   terminal (MT), incurring considerable cost for system integration and
   maintenance at millimeter-wave frequencies. We design a WoF transport
   system, aiming to centralize system functions in the central office
   (CO), without requiring electrical LO devices in both BS and MT. In our
   proposed scheme, LO has been centralized in CO, the LO signal is
   distributed as a service to carry out frequency up-/down-conversion
   functions required in BS and MT. Thus, in this simplified system
   architecture, the overall cost can be reduced and the operation quality
   of centralized LO service enhanced. The operation principle and
   feasibility of error-free transmission of multigigabit, bidirectional
   data streams over both fiber and free space has been demonstrated
   experimentally.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Tsunamis generated by deformable granular landslides are physically
   modeled in a three-dimensional tsunami wave basin based on the
   generalized Froude similarity. The dynamic landslide impact
   characteristics were controlled by means of a novel pneumatic landslide
   generator. The wave amplitudes, periods, and wavelengths are related to
   the landslide parameters at impact with the landslide Froude number
   being a dominant parameter. Between 1 and 15\% of the landslide kinetic
   energy at impact is converted into the wave train energy. The wave
   amplitudes decay in radial and angular directions from the landslide
   axis. The first wave crest mostly travels with speeds close to the
   theoretical approximation of the solitary wave speed. The measured
   tsunami wave profiles were either of the nonlinear oscillatory or
   nonlinear transition type depending primarily on the landslide Froude
   number and relative slide thickness at impact. The generated waves range
   from shallow to deep water depth regimes, with the majority being in the
   intermediate water depth regime. Wave characteristics are compared with
   other two- and three-dimensional landslide tsunami studies and the
   results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study mapped brain activity elicited by high frequency
   electroacupuncture by simultaneously using blood oxygenation level
   dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) contrasts. Forty subjects
   participated in the study, in which twenty ones were imaged during
   electrical acupoint stimulation (EAS) to the left LI4 acupoint at a
   maximal intensity without pain, and the others were with a minimal-EAS
   at a just detectible intensity. Both BOLD and CBF data were acquired
   simultaneously during alternating blocks of rest and stimulation. The
   results showed that the minimal-EAS mostly induced the activities in
   somatosensory region, including those in inferior parietal lobule, SII,
   insula, and thalamus. On the other hand, EAS activated more including
   also posterior middle cingulate cortex (pMCC), and deactivated superior
   temporal gyrus. Moreover, deactivation was found in posterior cingulated
   cortex (PCC), precuneus from BOLD and in culmen of cerebellum, caudate
   from CBF. The comparison between EAS and minimal-EAS revealed
   deactivation in the default mode network in both BOLD and CBF signals,
   activation in thalamus, insula, and caudal anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) in the CBF signal alone, and deactivation in putamen, rostral ACC
   and parahippocampal gyrus in the BOLD signal alone. This study provides,
   for the first time, simultaneous CBF and BOLD responses to high
   frequency EAS at the LI4 acupoint, revealing concordant and
   complementary insights into the neural effects of EAS, including
   modulation of subcortical structures and limbic system. (C) 2012

Title = {{Hydrate morphology: Physical properties of sands with patchy hydrate
   saturation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The physical properties of gas hydrate-bearing sediments depend on the
   volume fraction and spatial distribution of the hydrate phase. The host
   sediment grain size and the state of effective stress determine the
   hydrate morphology in sediments; this information can be used to
   significantly constrain estimates of the physical properties of
   hydrate-bearing sediments, including the coarse-grained sands subjected
   to high effective stress that are of interest as potential energy
   resources. Reported data and physical analyses suggest hydrate-bearing
   sands contain a heterogeneous, patchy hydrate distribution, whereby
   zones with 100\% pore-space hydrate saturation are embedded in
   hydrate-free sand. Accounting for patchy rather than homogeneous hydrate
   distribution yields more tightly constrained estimates of physical
   properties in hydrate-bearing sands and captures observed
   physical-property dependencies on hydrate saturation. For example,
   numerical modeling results of sands with patchy saturation agree with
   experimental observation, showing a transition in stiffness starting
   near the series bound at low hydrate saturations but moving toward the
   parallel bound at high hydrate saturations. The hydrate-patch size
   itself impacts the physical properties of hydrate-bearing sediments; for
   example, at constant hydrate saturation, we find that conductivity
   (electrical, hydraulic and thermal) increases as the number of
   hydrate-saturated patches increases. This increase reflects the larger
   number of conductive flow paths that exist in specimens with many small
   hydrate-saturated patches in comparison to specimens in which a few
   large hydrate saturated patches can block flow over a significant
   cross-section of the specimen.}},

Abstract = {{A series of benzothiadiazole oligothiophene and oligo(thienylene
   vinylene) donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymers were synthesized and
   characterized. These low optical band gap materials (similar to 1.5 eV)
   are capable of absorbing photons in the range of 400-800 nm and exhibit
   good thermal stability. Their hole mobilities, determined using an
   organic field-effect transistor (OFET) architecture, vary over a range
   of 3 orders of magnitude and strongly correlate with the molecular
   ordering and morphology of the respective thin films. Spin-coated films
   of the poly(benzothiadiazole-sexithiophene) PBT6, which exhibits a
   highly crystalline lamellar pi-pi stacked edge-on orientation on the
   OFET substrate, possesses a hole mobility of ca. 0.2 cm(2)/V.s.
   Vinylene-containing analogs PBT6V2 and PBT6V2' are amorphous and exhibit
   very low mobilities. The molecular weight of PBT6 has a strong influence
   on the electronic properties: a sample with a lower molecular weight
   exhibits a mobility approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than the
   high molecular weight homologue, and the absorption maximum is
   appreciably blue-shifted. The hole mobility of PBT6 is further enhanced
   by a factor of ca. 3 through fabrication of the OFET by drop casting.
   OFETs fabricated by this process exhibit mobilities of up to 0.75
   cm(2)/V.s and I-ON/OFF ratios in the range of 10(6)-10(7). These results
   demonstrate the potential of incorporating benzothiadiazole units into
   polythiophene derivatives to develop, high-mobility semiconducting
   polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Microwaves (MWs) are applied to initialize deoxygenation of graphene
   oxide (GO) in the solid state and at low temperatures (similar to 165
   degrees C). The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MW-reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) show a significantly reduced concentration of
   oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and
   carbonyl. X-ray photoelectron spectra confirm that microwaves can
   promote deoxygenation of GO at relatively low temperatures. Raman
   spectra and TGA measurements indicate that the defect level of GO
   significantly decreases during the isothermal solid-state MW-reduction
   process at low temperatures, corresponding to an efficient recovery of
   the fine graphene lattice structure. Based on both deoxygenation and
   defect-level reduction, the resurgence of interconnected graphene-like
   domains contributes to a low sheet resistance (similar to 7.9x10(4)
   Omega per square) of the MW-reduced GO on SiO2-coated Si substrates with
   an optical transparency of 92.7\% at similar to 547 nm after MW
   reduction, indicating the ultrahigh efficiency of MW in GO reduction.
   Moreover, the low-temperature solid-state MW reduction is also applied
   in preparing flexible transparent conductive coatings on
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates. UV/Vis measurements indicate
   that the transparency of the thus-prepared MW-reduced GO coatings on
   PDMS substrates ranges from 34 to 96\%. Correspondingly, the sheet
   resistance of the coating ranges from 10(5) to 10(9) Omega per square,
   indicating that MW reduction of GO is promising for the convenient
   low-temperature preparation of transparent conductors on flexible
   polymeric substrates.}},

Title = {{A network model for prediction and diagnosis of sediment dynamics at the
   watershed scale}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{We present a semi-distributed model that simulates suspended sediment
   export from a watershed in two stages: (1) delivery of sediments from
   hillslope and bank erosion into the river channel, and (2) propagation
   of the channel sediments through the river network toward the watershed
   outlet. The model conceptualizes a watershed as the collection of
   reaches, or representative elementary watersheds (REW), that are
   connected to each other through the river network, and each REW
   comprises a lumped representation of a hillslope and channel component.
   The flow of water along the stream network is modeled through coupled
   mass and momentum balance equations applied in all REWs and sediment
   transport within each REW is simulated through the sediment balance
   equations. Every reach receives sediment inputs from upstream REWs (if
   present) and from the erosion of adjacent hillslopes, banks and channel
   bed. We tested this model using 12 years (1982-1993) of high temporal
   resolution data from Goodwin Creek, a 21.3 km(2) watershed in
   Mississippi, USA. The model yields good estimates of sediment export
   patterns at the watershed outlet, with Pearson correlation coefficient
   (R value) of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.95 at daily, monthly, and annual
   resolution, respectively. Furthermore, the model shows that the dynamics
   of sediment transport are controlled to a large extent by the
   differences in the behavior of coarse and fine sediment particles,
   temporary channel storage, and the spatial variability in climatic
   forcing. These processes have a bearing on the patterns of sediment
   delivery with increasing scale.}},

Abstract = {{Long-range corrected hybrid functionals that employ a nonempirically
   tuned range-separation parameter have been demonstrated to yield
   accurate ionization potentials and fundamental gaps for a wide range of
   finite systems. Here, we address the question of whether this high level
   of accuracy is limited to the highest occupied/lowest unoccupied energy
   levels to which the range-separation parameter is tuned or whether it is
   retained for the entire valence spectrum. We examine several
   pi-conjugated molecules and find that orbitals of a different character
   and symmetry require significantly different range-separation parameters
   and fractions of exact exchange. This imbalanced treatment of orbitals
   of a different nature biases the resulting eigenvalue spectra. Thus, the
   existing schemes for the tuning of range-separated hybrid functionals,
   while providing for good agreement between the highest occupied energy
   level and the first ionization potential, do not achieve accuracy
   comparable to reliable G(0)W(0) computations for the entire
   quasiparticle spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of a novel and highly robust
   monomethyl-functionalized Zr-based MOF (UiO-66-MM) by presynthesis
   functionalization of the BDC ligand. UiO-66-MM is isostructural to
   UiO-66 and is characterized by PXRD, FTIR, N-2 adsorption, NMR, and TGA.
   Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are performed to confirm
   the increase in adsorbate-adsorbent interactions for CO2 and CH4
   observed during the experimental measurements. This enhancement is due
   to the presence of the methyl group in UiO-66-MM, which increases the
   adsorption potential by constricting the pore diameter. However,
   UiO-66-MM is less hydrophilic than the parent UiO-66 due to the nonpolar
   methyl groups and adsorbs almost 30\% less water than UiO-66. This new
   MOF also has a much higher CO2/CH4 selectivity under dry conditions due
   to enhanced van der Waals interactions with CO2. Hence, we expect
   UiO-66-MM to exhibit superior performance over the parent MOF in humid
   gas separations.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of transient stress waves on the microstructure of
   HMX-Estane, a polymer-bonded explosive (PBX), is studied. Calculations
   carried out concern microstructures with HMX grain sizes on the order of
   200 mm and grain volume fractions in the range of 0.50-0.82. The
   microstructural samples analysed have an aspect ratio of 5 : 1 (15 x 3
   mm), allowing the transient wave propagation process resulting from
   normal impact to be resolved. Boundary loading is effected by the
   imposition of impact face velocities of 50200ms-1. Different levels of
   grain-binder interface strength are considered. The analysis uses a
   recently developed cohesive finite element framework that accounts for
   coupled thermal-mechanical processes involving deformation, heat
   generation and conduction, failure in the forms of microcracks in both
   bulk constituents and along grain/matrix interfaces, and frictional
   heating along crack faces. Results show that the overall wave speed
   through the microstructures depends on both the grain volume fraction
   and interface bonding strength between the constituents and that the
   distance traversed by the stress wave before the initiation of
   frictional dissipation is independent of the grain volume fraction but
   increases with impact velocity. Energy dissipated per unit volume owing
   to fracture is highest near the impact surface and deceases to zero at
   the stress wavefront. On the other hand, the peak temperature rises are
   noted to occur approximately 2-3mm from the impact surface. Scaling laws
   are developed for the maximum dissipation rate and the highest
   temperature rise as functions of impact velocity, grain volume fraction
   and grain-binder interfacial bonding strength.}},

Abstract = {{Narrow crevices are challenging terrain for most organisms and
   biomimetic robots. Snakes move through crevices using sequential folding
   and unfolding of their bodies in the manner of an accordion or
   concertina. In this combined experimental and theoretical investigation,
   we elucidate this effective means of moving through channels. We measure
   the frictional properties of corn snakes, their body kinematics and the
   transverse forces they apply to channels of varying width and
   inclination. To climb channels inclined at 60 degrees, we find snakes
   use a combination of ingenious friction-enhancing techniques, including
   digging their ventral scales to double their frictional coefficient and
   pushing channel walls transversely with up to nine times body weight.
   Theoretical modelling of a one-dimensional n-linked crawler is used to
   calculate the transverse force factor of safety: we find snakes push up
   to four times more than required to prevent sliding backwards,
   presumably trading metabolic energy for an assurance of wall stability.}},

Abstract = {{UiO-66 is one of the few known water-stable MOFs that are readily

   synthesized with amino-, nitro-, methoxy-, and naphthyl-substituted

   Pure-component CO2, CH4, N-2, and water vapor adsorption isotherms were
   measured in the materials to study the effect of the functional group on
   the adsorption behavior. Heats of adsorption were calculated for each
   pure gas on each material. The results indicate that the
   amino-functionalized material possesses the best adsorption properties
   for each pure gas due to a combination of polarity and small functional
   group size. The naphthyl-functionalized material exhibits a good
   combination of inhibited water vapor adsorption and high selectivity for
   CO2 over CH4 and N-2.}},

Abstract = {{Plumes of contaminated groundwater often pass through an oxic/anoxic
   interface when they discharge into surface water bodies. We tested the
   hypothesis that contaminants recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions but
   degradable under aerobic conditions can be biodegraded at the interface
   resulting in the protection of the overlying water. Flow-through columns
   containing sediment and water were used to evaluate degradation of
   synthetic organic compounds at the thin organic layer at the
   sediment/water interface. Sediment samples collected from several sites
   contaminated with nitrobenzene (NB) or chlorobenzene (CB) were tested
   for their biodegradation capacities in the columns. The biodegradation
   capacities of sediment in the columns were 2-4,2 g CB.m(-2).d(-1) and
   6.5 g NB.m(2).d(-1). Bacteria able to carry out rapid and complete
   biodegradation of CB or NB were detected in the sediments prior to the
   experiments, which suggested the presence of an active microbial
   community at the contaminated sites. The results revealed robust
   biodegradation of toxic compounds migrating across the sediment/water
   interface and indicate that the biodegradation capacities were
   sufficient to eliminate transport of the contaminants to the overlying
   water in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Dioxygenation of aromatic rings is frequently the initial step of
   biodegradation of organic subsurface pollutants. This process can be
   tracked by compound-specific isotope analysis to assess the extent of
   contaminant transformation, but the corresponding isotope effects,
   especially for dioxygenation of N-substituted,. aromatic contaminants,
   are not well understood. We investigated the C and N isotope
   fractionation associated with the biodegradation of aniline and
   diphenylamine using pure cultures of Burkholderia sp. strain JS667,
   which can biodegrade both compounds, each by a distinct dioxygenase
   enzyme. For diphenylamine, the C and N isotope enrichment was normal
   with epsilon(C)- and epsilon(N)-values of -0.6 +/- 0.1 parts per
   thousand and -1.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, respectively. In contrast,
   N isotopes of aniline were subject to substantial inverse fractionation
   (epsilon(N) of +13 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand), whereas the
   epsilon(C)-value was identical to that of diphenylamine. A comparison of
   the apparent kinetic isotope effects for aniline and diphenylamine
   dioxygenation with those from abiotic oxidation by manganese oxide
   (MnO2) suggest that the oxidation of a diarylamine system leads to
   distinct C-N bonding changes compared to aniline regardless of reaction
   mechanism and oxidant involved. Combined evaluation of the C and N
   isotope signatures of the contaminants reveals characteristic Delta
   delta N-15/Delta delta C-13-trends for the identification of
   diphenylamine and aniline oxidation in contaminated subsurfaces and for
   the distinction of aniline oxidation from its formation by microbial
   and/or abiotic reduction of nitrobenzene.}},

Title = {{Monoaminergic Modulation of Spinal Viscero-Sympathetic Function in the
   Neonatal Mouse Thoracic Spinal Cord}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Descending serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems project
   diffusely to sensory, motor and autonomic spinal cord regions. Using
   neonatal mice, this study examined monoaminergic modulation of visceral
   sensory input and sympathetic preganglionic output. Whole-cell
   recordings from sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) in spinal cord
   slice demonstrated that serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine modulated
   SPN excitability. Serotonin depolarized all, while noradrenaline and
   dopamine depolarized most SPNs. Serotonin and noradrenaline also
   increased SPN current-evoked firing frequency, while both increases and
   decreases were seen with dopamine. In an in vitro thoracolumbar spinal
   cord/sympathetic chain preparation, stimulation of splanchnic nerve
   visceral afferents evoked reflexes and subthreshold population synaptic
   potentials in thoracic ventral roots that were dose-dependently
   depressed by the monoamines. Visceral afferent stimulation also evoked
   bicuculline-sensitive dorsal root potentials thought to reflect
   presynaptic inhibition via primary afferent depolarization. These dorsal
   root potentials were likewise dose-dependently depressed by the
   monoamines. Concomitant monoaminergic depression of population afferent
   synaptic transmission recorded as dorsal horn field potentials was also
   seen. Collectively, serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine were shown to
   exert broad and comparable modulatory regulation of viscero-sympathetic
   function. The general facilitation of SPN efferent excitability with
   simultaneous depression of visceral afferent-evoked motor output
   suggests that descending monoaminergic systems reconfigure spinal cord
   autonomic function away from visceral sensory influence. Coincident
   monoaminergic reductions in dorsal horn responses support a multifaceted
   modulatory shift in the encoding of spinal visceral afferent activity.
   Similar monoamine-induced changes have been observed for somatic
   sensorimotor function, suggesting an integrative modulatory response on
   spinal autonomic and somatic function.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{The properties of carbon nanotube (CNT)/polymer composites are strongly
   dependent on the dispersion and orientation of CNTs in the host matrix.
   Quantification of the dispersion and orientation of CNTs by means of
   microstructure observation and image analysis has been demonstrated as a
   useful way to understand the structure-property relationship of
   CNT/polymer composites. However, due to the various morphologies and
   large amount of CNTs in one image, automatic and accurate identification
   of CNTs has become the bottleneck for dispersion/orientation analysis.
   To solve this problem, shape identification is performed for each pixel
   in the filler identification step, so that individual CNTs can be
   extracted from images automatically. The improved filler identification
   enables more accurate analysis of CNT dispersion and orientation. The
   dispersion index and orientation index obtained for both synthetic and
   real images from model compounds correspond well with the observations.
   Moreover, these indices help to explain the electrical properties of
   CNT/silicone composite, which is used as a model compound. This method
   can also be extended to other polymer composites with high-aspect-ratio
   fillers.}},

Abstract = {{Cryopreservation is important for clinical translation of
   tissue-engineered constructs. With respect to a pancreatic substitute,
   encapsulated islets or beta cells have been widely studied for the
   treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Besides cell viability
   loss, cryopreservation may affect the function of the remaining viable
   cells in a pancreatic substitute by altering fundamental processes in
   glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, such as pathways associated with
   intermediary metabolism, potentially leading to insulin-secretion
   defects. In this study, we used C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy and isotopomer analysis to determine the effects of
   conventional freezing and ice-free cryopreservation (vitrification) on
   carbon flow through tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated pathways
   in encapsulated murine insulinoma beta TC-tet cells; the secretory
   function of the encapsulated cells postpreservation was also evaluated.
   Specifically, calcium alginate-encapsulated bTC-tet cells were frozen or
   vitrified with a cryoprotectant cocktail. Beads were warmed and C-13
   labeling and extraction were performed. Insulin secretion rates were
   determined during basal and labeling periods and during small-scale
   glucose stimulation and K+-induced depolarization. Relative metabolic
   fluxes were determined from C-13 NMR spectra using a modified single
   pyruvate pool model with the tcaCALC modeling program. Treatments were
   compared with nonpreserved controls. Results showed that relative carbon
   flow through TCA-cycle-associated pathways was not affected by
   conventional freezing or vitrification. However, vitrification, but not
   freezing, led to impaired insulin secretion on a per viable cell basis.
   The reduced secretion from the Vitrified group occurred irrespective of
   scale and was present whether secretion was stimulated by glucose or
   K+-induced depolarization, indicating that it might be due to a defect
   in late-stage secretion events.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{K-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering
   algorithm. Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this
   algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster
   centers. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address
   this problem. Many of these methods, however, have superlinear
   complexity in the number of data points, making them impractical for
   large data sets. On the other hand, linear methods are often random
   and/or order-sensitive, which renders their results unrepeatable.
   Recently, Su and Dy proposed two highly successful hierarchical
   initialization methods named Var-Part and PCA-Part that are not only
   linear, but also deterministic (nonrandom) and order-invariant. In this
   paper, we propose a discriminant analysis based approach that addresses
   a common deficiency of these two methods. Experiments on a large and
   diverse collection of data sets from the UCI machine learning repository
   demonstrate that Var-Part and PCA-Part are highly competitive with one
   of the best random initialization methods to date, i.e. k-means++, and
   that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of
   both hierarchical methods.}},

Abstract = {{The presented study reports on numerical simulations of flows in tidal
   channels near Rose Dhu Island, GA, which is used to identify hotspots of
   hydrokinetic energy and to assess the tidal stream energy potential at
   this site. The numerical simulations are complemented with field
   measurements of local current velocities and water surface heights,
   which are used to validate the simulations. Both velocity distributions
   and water surface heights as predicted by the numerical model are in
   good agreement with observed data. The simulations reveal a tidal
   asymmetry in the encompassing Ogeechee estuary with the ebb tide
   currents dominating over the flood tide ones. The model is able to
   successfully predict the distribution of discharge into the smaller
   creeks around Rose Dhu Island and thereby capturing the location of
   local hotspots of hydrokinetic energy. It is found that local hotspots
   do exist near the island, and the analysis suggests the maximum
   available annual power of 4.75 MW, with a peak estimated extraction
   surpassing 4 KW during Spring tides. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {{Functional Analysis of Metabolic Channeling and Regulation in Lignin
   Biosynthesis: A Computational Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Lignin is a polymer in secondary cell walls of plants that is known to
   have negative impacts on forage digestibility, pulping efficiency, and
   sugar release from cellulosic biomass. While targeted modifications of
   different lignin biosynthetic enzymes have permitted the generation of
   transgenic plants with desirable traits, such as improved digestibility
   or reduced recalcitrance to saccharification, some of the engineered
   plants exhibit monomer compositions that are clearly at odds with the
   expected outcomes when the biosynthetic pathway is perturbed. In
   Medicago, such discrepancies were partly reconciled by the recent
   finding that certain biosynthetic enzymes may be spatially organized
   into two independent channels for the synthesis of guaiacyl (G) and
   syringyl (S) lignin monomers. Nevertheless, the mechanistic details, as
   well as the biological function of these interactions, remain unclear.
   To decipher the working principles of this and similar control
   mechanisms, we propose and employ here a novel computational approach
   that permits an expedient and exhaustive assessment of hundreds of
   minimal designs that could arise in vivo. Interestingly, this
   comparative analysis not only helps distinguish two most parsimonious
   mechanisms of crosstalk between the two channels by formulating a
   targeted and readily testable hypothesis, but also suggests that the G
   lignin-specific channel is more important for proper functioning than
   the S lignin-specific channel. While the proposed strategy of analysis
   in this article is tightly focused on lignin synthesis, it is likely to
   be of similar utility in extracting unbiased information in a variety of
   situations, where the spatial organization of molecular components is
   critical for coordinating the flow of cellular information, and where
   initially various control designs seem equally valid. Citation: Lee Y,

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of a recently developed concurrent
   atomistic continuum (CAC) methodology in coarse-grained (CG) atomistic
   simulations of dislocation nucleation and migration in face-centered
   cubic (fcc) Al, Ni and Cu crystals, using an EAM force field and an
   adaptive mesh refinement strategy. The CAC method is based on recently
   developed atomistic field theory (AFT) that frames the problem in terms
   of a continuum field representation of lattice and sublattice atomic
   arrangements. Four sets of CG models with different finite element mesh
   refinement are constructed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the CG
   method relative to full molecular dynamics (MD). Simulation results show
   that the CG method is able to reproduce key phenomena of dislocation
   dynamics in initially defect free fcc crystals, including strain bursts
   caused by dislocation nucleation and migration, the structure of leading
   and trailing partial dislocations separated by equilibrium stacking
   faults in Al, formation of intrinsic stacking fault ribbons in Ni and
   Cu, and 3D migration of curved dislocations, all comparable with results
   of MD simulations. CG simulations have also revealed that the yield
   strength of Al depends on the thickness of the specimens as well as the
   operative deformation mechanisms. The effects of mesh size and adaptive
   mesh refinement on CG simulation results are analyzed and discussed. (C)

Title = {{Contrasting the Predictions for Coulomb and Creep-Rate-Dependent
   Friction in the Modeling of Fiber-Draw Processes}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important features in industrial fiber-drawing processes
   is the friction between filament tow and draw rollers, because it is
   what creates the tension in the fiber that performs the draw. To
   understand fiber draw, therefore, it would be valuable to examine the
   sensitivity of model predictions to the choice of the idealization of
   the friction incorporated in the model. This paper begins the
   comparative study by deriving and solving models for fiber draw, which
   for the first time study the friction between filament tow and draw
   rollers as something other than Coulomb friction, namely
   creep-rate-dependent friction. Sensitivity of the draw model to the
   choice of friction idealization is investigated by contrasting process
   simulations employing the usual Coulomb model for friction with
   simulations of the same processes employing the creep-rate-dependent
   friction model. It is demonstrated that the draw-model predictions of
   fiber behavior depend both qualitatively and quantitatively on the
   specific idealization of the friction between filament and rollers. For
   example, whereas the Coulomb friction model predicts adhesion zones on
   the rollers, in which the fibers and roller move together with no slip,
   there are strictly no adhesion zones with the creep-rate-dependent
   friction model, although with a choice of processing parameters the
   predicted relative velocity between fiber and roller can be made
   arbitrarily small. With the creep-rate-dependent friction model the
   fiber speed at the point of attachment to the draw roller must be
   greater than the roller surface speed for the equations of momentum to
   be satisfied. This small, but finite, abrupt change in speed profile can
   be interpreted as the formation of a neck in the fiber just upstream of
   the point of attachment to the roller. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005532]}},

Abstract = {{We in situ probed the surface band bending (SBB) by ultraviolet
   photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in conjunction with field-effect
   transistor measurements on the incompletely depleted ZnO nanowires
   (NWs). The diameter range of the NWs is ca. 150-350 nm. Several surface
   treatments (i.e., heat treatments and Au nanoparticle (NP) decoration)
   were conducted to assess the impact of the oxygen adsorbates on the SBB.
   A 100 degrees C heat treatment leads to the decrease of the SBB to 0.74
   +/- 0.15 eV with 29.9 +/- 3.0 nm width, which is attributed to the
   removal of most adsorbed oxygen molecules from the ZnO NW surfaces. The
   SBB of the oxygen-adsorbed ZnO NWs is measured to be 1.53 +/- 0.15 eV
   with 43.2 +/- 2.0 nm width. The attachment of Au NPs to the NW surface
   causes unusually high SBB (2.34 +/- 0.15 eV with the wide width of 53.3
   +/- 1.6 nm) by creating open-circuit nano-Schottky junctions and
   catalytically enhancing the formation of the charge 02 adsorbates. These
   surface-related phenomena should be generic to all metal oxide
   nanostructures. Our study is greatly beneficial for the NW-based device
   design of sensor and optoelectronic applications via surface
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of hybrid zeolitic materials with complex
   micropore-mesopore structures and morphologies is an expanding area of
   recent interest for a number of applications. Here we report a new type
   of hybrid zeolite material composed of a layered zeolite material grown
   epitaxially on the surface of a bulk zeolite,Material. Specifically;
   layered (2-D) MFI sheets were grown on the surface of bulk MA crystals
   of different sizes (300 nm and 10 mu m), thereby resulting in a hybrid
   Material containing a unique morphology of interconnected micropores
   (similar to 035 nm) and rnesopores (similar to 3 nm). The structure and
   morphology of this material referred to as a ``bulk MFI-layered MFI{''}
   (BMLM) material, was elucidated by a combination of XRD; TEM, HRTEM,
   SEM, TGA, and N-2 physisorption techniques. If is Conclusively shown
   that epitaxial growth of the 2-D layered MFI sheets occurs in at least
   two principal crystallographic directions of the bulk MFI crystal and
   possibly In the third direction as well. The BMLM material combines the
   properties of bulk MFI (micropore network and mechanical support) and
   2-D layered MFI (large surface roughness, external surface area, and
   mesoporosity). As an example of the uses of the BMLM material, it was
   incorporated into a polyimide and fabricated into a composite membrane
   with enhanced permeability for CO2 and good CO2/CH4 selectivity for gas
   separations. SEM-EDX imaging and composition analysis showed that the
   polyimide and the BMLM interpenetrate into each other, thereby forming a
   well-adhered polymer/particle microstructure, in contrast with the
   defective Interfacial microstructure Obtained using bare MFI particles.
   Analysis of the gas permeation data with the modified Maxwell model also
   allows the estimation of the effective volume of the BMLM particles, as
   well as the CO2 and CH4 gas permeabilities of the interpenetrated layer
   at the BMLWpolyimicle Interface.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to fabricate 3D spiraling structures using metal-assisted
   chemical etching (MaCE) Is one of the unique advantages of MaCE over
   traditional etching methods. However, control over the chirality of the
   spiraling structures has not been established. In this work, a
   systematic parametric study was undertaken for MaCE of star-shaped
   catalysts, examining the influence of arm shape, arm length, number of
   arms, center core diameter, and catalyst thickness on the rotation
   direction. This data was used to identify a set of geometric parameters
   that reliably induce rotation in a predefined direction such that large
   arrays of 3D spiraling structures can be fabricated with the same
   chirality. Electroless deposition into the MaCE template was used to
   examine the full etch path of the catalyst and an experimental fit was
   established to control rotation angle by adjusting the catalyst's center
   core diameter. The ability to fabricate large arrays of 3D spiraling
   structures with predefined chirality could have important applications
   in photonics and optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart is a general method in statistical control
   engineering to monitor controlled variables. CUSUM chart has been
   applied to VAV terminal units by NIST for fault detection, known as VAV
   Box Performance Assessment Control Charts (VPACC) method. This paper
   combines CUSUM method with a fault counter approach, which extends the
   functionality of CUSUM method from fault detection to fault diagnostics.
   To use this method, user needs to specify a causal relationship between
   all the control variables, and between the control variables and their
   controlling components. Based on the real time monitored data, a CUSUM
   score is calculated for each control variable, and a fault counter is
   then updated based on an automatic count mechanism. The testing of this
   approach in a simulation case shows that it has good performance in
   detecting incipient faults. It is realized that the CUSUM method can
   only detect faults that lead to control problems, therefore the
   capability of this method is limited. But the proposed method has some
   strong advantages, for example, it requires only building control
   related sensor information, and it can be easily adapted if the system
   is changed or upgraded, which frequently happens in renovations. (C)

Abstract = {{Handling en route emergencies in modern transport aircraft through
   adequate teamwork between the pilot, the crew and the aircraft's
   automation systems is an ongoing and active field of research. An
   automated path planning aid tool can assist pilots with the tasks of
   selecting a convenient landing site and developing a safe path to land
   at this site in the event of an onboard emergency. This paper highlights
   the pilot evaluation results of a human factors study as part of such a
   proposed automated planning aid. Focusing on the interactions between
   the pilot and the automated planning aid, the presented results suggest
   that a particular implementation of the pilot aid interface, which uses
   a simple dial to sort the most promising landing sites, was effective.
   This selectable sorting capability, motivated by the anticipated
   cognitive mode of the pilot crew, improved the quality of the selected
   site for the majority of the cases tested. Although the presented
   approach increased the average time required for the selection of an
   alternate landing site, it decreased the time to complete the task in
   the case of emergencies unfamiliar to the pilot crew.}},

Abstract = {{A method for assessing the impact of vehicle technologies and new
   aircraft concepts at the fleet level is presented. Various aspects of
   the method constitute a departure from standard practice intended to
   address known shortcomings and advance the state of the art. In
   particular, an operational activity growth routine is implemented where
   operational sets are grown to match top-level and airport-level
   forecasts that are fully balanced for all origin-destination airport
   pairs. The proposed approach also features a novel fleet evolution
   scheme where replacements are devised on the basis of mission
   capabilities for aircraft types rather than on seat classes, and the
   retirement of aircraft is applied to models introduced beyond the
   reference year. Surrogate models of fuel burn are regressed from
   gold-standard modeling tools and are shown to be suitable for
   system-wide assessments on the basis of model representation accuracy.
   Fleet assessment results are shown for various technology introduction
   and growth scenarios and indicate that an introduction of NASA vehicle
   technologies across the fleet in 2025 can yield up to 436.05 x 10(9) kg
   of fuel savings through 2050, or up to 94.6 million additional
   operations for that same period assuming a 2050 total fuel-burn cap at

Title = {{Nanopatterning reveals an ECM area threshold for focal adhesion assembly

Abstract = {{Integrin-based focal adhesions (FA) transmit anchorage and traction
   forces between the cell and the extracellular matrix (ECM). To gain
   further insight into the physical parameters of the ECM that control FA
   assembly and force transduction in non- migrating cells, we used
   fibronectin (FN) nanopatterning within a cell adhesion-resistant
   background to establish the threshold area of ECM ligand required for
   stable FA assembly and force transduction. Integrin-FN clustering and
   adhesive force were strongly modulated by the geometry of the nanoscale
   adhesive area. Individual nanoisland area, not the number of nanoislands
   or total adhesive area, controlled integrin-FN clustering and adhesion
   strength. Importantly, below an area threshold (0.11 mu m(2)), very few
   integrin-FN clusters and negligible adhesive forces were generated. We
   then asked whether this adhesive area threshold could be modulated by
   intracellular pathways known to influence either adhesive force,
   cytoskeletal tension, or the structural link between the two. Expression
   of talin- or vinculin-head domains that increase integrin activation or
   clustering overcame this nanolimit for stable integrin-FN clustering and
   increased adhesive force. Inhibition of myosin contractility in cells
   expressing a vinculin mutant that enhances cytoskeleton-integrin
   coupling also restored integrin-FN clustering below the nanolimit. We
   conclude that the minimum area of integrin-FN clusters required for
   stable assembly of nanoscale FA and adhesive force transduction is not a
   constant; rather it has a dynamic threshold that results from an
   equilibrium between pathways controlling adhesive force, cytoskeletal
   tension, and the structural linkage that transmits these forces,
   allowing the balance to be tipped by factors that regulate these
   mechanical parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The sediment erosion rate flume (SERF) is used to evaluate various

   particle diameter. Using pressure drops to estimate shear stress appears
   to underestimate rough sample (grain sizes > 0.25 mm) stresses.
   Likewise, smooth-wall assumptions and analytical methods also appear to

Abstract = {{Due to space limitations, cost restrictions, and performance challenges,
   the physical control mechanism on a smart projectile plays a central
   role in the overall system design. Many different smart projectile
   control mechanisms have been created including aerodynamic-based
   mechanisms such as movable canards, propellant-based mechanisms such as
   squibs, and inertia-based mechanisms such as internal moving masses. The
   work reported here considers small microspoilers located between rear
   fins of a finned projectile to create aerodynamic load changes to enable
   projectile control. In particular, boundary-layer shock interaction
   between the projectile body, fins, and microspoilers provides a
   multiplicative effect on controllable forces and moments induced by
   microspoiler activation. A parametric study varying the microspoiler
   configuration is conducted to examine the level of control authority
   possible for this control mechanism concept. Results indicate that
   relatively small microspoilers located between fins generate substantial
   control authority that is capable of eliminating impact errors caused by
   muzzle jump, aerodynamic uncertainty, and atmospheric winds. These
   conclusions are based on computational fluid dynamic predictions of the
   effect of microspoilers on air loads coupled to a rigid
   six-degree-of-freedom projectile trajectory simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Faulting has traditionally been collected by using manual methods, which
   are labor intensive, time-consuming, and hazardous to workers and
   drivers. Therefore, alternative methods for effectively and safely
   collecting faulting data are needed. With emerging laser technology
   originally designed for crack detection, high-resolution, full
   lane-width coverage, three-dimensional (3D) continuous pavement profile
   data can now be acquired. This paper critically assesses the feasibility
   of using this 3D continuous pavement profile data for measuring faulting
   with a special focus on accuracy and repeatability. Controlled field
   tests were conducted to evaluate the accuracy for faulting in different
   ranges. Field tests were conducted at highway speeds on I-16 in Georgia
   to evaluate the repeatability and feasibility of the proposed method.
   Results show the proposed method can estimate faulting with an average
   error of less than 1 mm compared with those measured using the Georgia
   fault meter, and it can achieve reasonable repeatability with a standard
   deviation less than 1 mm in repeated runs at different highway speeds.
   Two tests have demonstrated that it is feasible to collect faulting data
   using 3D continuous pavement profile data. Recommendations for future
   research are also discussed. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000430.

Abstract = {{Oil contaminants attached to soils were separated using the bubble
   energies from the bursting and coalescence. The separation efficiency
   increased when the rotary kilns were combined. Wastewater containing
   separated oil contaminants was treated with the buoyant energy of
   bubbles and with positively charged bubbles. The water quality of the
   treated wastewater was good enough for the latter to be used as recycled
   water for bubble generation. The separation and treatment efficiencies
   of the novel oil washing process developed in this study was found to be
   similar to that of the existing oil washing process operated under
   high-temperature and high-pressure conditions and with dosage of
   chemicals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Chondrocyte-Like Cells Support Neocartilage Development}},

Abstract = {{Controlled differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the
   chondrogenic lineage is crucial for in vitro generation of neocartilage,
   yet achieving it remains challenging. Traditional protocols for MSC
   differentiation using exogenous inductive molecules, such as
   transforming growth factor-beta, fall short in meeting the needs of
   clinical applications because they yield differentiated cells that
   exhibit hypertrophic characteristics and subsequently facilitate
   endochondral bone formation. The objective of the current study was to
   deliver endogenous inductive factors from juvenile articular
   chondrocytes to bone marrow-derived MSCs to drive MSC chondrogenic
   differentiation through cocultivation of the two cell types in the
   absence of direct physical contact and exogenous stimulators. An initial
   chondrocyte/MSC ratio of 63:1 was identified as the appropriate
   proportion of the two cell populations to ensure that coculture-driven
   MSC-differentiated (CDMD) cells replicated the cellular morphology,
   behavior, and phenotype of articular chondrocytes. In a
   three-dimensional agarose system, CDMD cells were further shown to
   develop into robust neocartilage structurally and mechanically stronger
   than chondrocyte-laden constructs and with reduced hypertrophic
   potential. Although MSCs tended to lose the ability to express CD44, an
   important regulator in cartilage biology, during the coculture
   induction, CDMD cells regained this function in the three-dimensional
   tissue cultivation. The present work establishes a chondrocyte/MSC
   coculture model that serves as a template to better understand
   chondrocyte-driven MSC differentiation and provides insights for
   improved strategies to develop clinically relevant cartilage tissue
   replacements. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2012;1:843-854}},

Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{1547-1568}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Microneedles were first conceptualized for drug delivery many decades
   ago, but only became the subject of significant research starting in the
   mid-1990's when microfabrication technology enabled their manufacture as
   (i) solid microneedles for skin pretreatment to increase skin
   permeability, (ii) microneedles coated with drug that dissolves off in
   the skin, (iii) polymer microneedles that encapsulate drug and fully
   dissolve in the skin and (iv) hollow microneedles for drug infusion into
   the skin. As shown in more than 350 papers now published in the field,
   microneedles have been used to deliver a broad range of different low
   molecular weight drugs, biotherapeutics and vaccines, including
   published human studies with a number of small-molecule and protein
   drugs and vaccines. Influenza vaccination using a hollow microneedle is
   in widespread clinical use and a number of solid microneedle products
   are sold for cosmetic purposes. In addition to applications in the skin,
   microneedles have also been adapted for delivery of bioactives into the
   eye and into cells. Successful application of microneedles depends on
   device function that facilitates microneedle insertion and possible
   infusion into skin, skin recovery after microneedle removal, and drug
   stability during manufacturing, storage and delivery, and on patient
   outcomes, including lack of pain, skin irritation and skin infection, in
   addition to drug efficacy and safety. Building off a strong technology
   base and multiple demonstrations of successful drug delivery,
   microneedles are poised to advance further into clinical practice to
   enable better pharmaceutical therapies, vaccination and other
   applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction in contact resistance is one of the foremost challenges for
   carbon nanotube/graphene nanodevices. In this study, we present a novel
   fabrication process for low-temperature, Ohmic contact between
   open-ended multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and metal interconnects
   using graphitic carbon deposited via electron beam-induced deposition
   (EBID). The electrical and structural properties of the contact
   interface are characterized for making connection to the single
   (outermost) shell only, as well as to multiple conducting shells of
   MWCNTs. In addition to establishing the scaling relationship between the
   carbon contact length and the resulting contact resistance, the
   magnitude of the contact resistance has been quantified with and without
   post-deposition thermal annealing. The results indicate that the contact
   is Ohmic in nature, and ranges from 26.5 k Omega for the connection made
   to the outermost shell of an MWCNT down to just 116 Omega for the
   multiple-shell connection performed via a process suggested through the
   EBID process simulations. These results provide a significant advance in
   application of MWCNTs to future interconnect technologies.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in the power-to-weight ratio demand on rotordynamic systems
   causes increased susceptibility to transverse fatigue cracking of the
   shaft. The ability to detect cracks at an early stage of progression is
   imperative for minimizing off-line repair time and cost. The vibration
   monitoring system initially proposed in Part I is employed herein, using
   the 2X harmonic response component of the rotor tilt as a signature
   indicating a transverse shaft crack. In addition, the analytic work
   presented in Part I is expanded to include a new notch crack model to
   better approximate experimental results. To effectively capture the 2X
   response, the crack model must include the local nature of the crack,
   the depth of the crack, and the stiffness asymmetry inducing the
   gravity-forced 2X harmonic response. The transfer matrix technique is
   well suited to incorporate these crack attributes due to its modular
   nature. Two transfer matrix models are proposed to predict the 2X
   harmonic response. The first model applies local crack flexibility
   coefficients determined using the strain energy release rate, while the
   second incorporates the crack as a rectangular notch to emulate a
   manufactured crack used in the experiments. Analytic results are
   compared to experimental measurement of the rotor tilt gleaned from an
   overhung rotor test rig originally designed to monitor seal face
   dynamics. The test rig is discussed, and experimental angular response
   orbits and 2X harmonic amplitudes of the rotor tilt are provided for
   shafts containing manufactured cracks of depths between 0\% and 40\%.
   Feasibility of simultaneous multiple-fault detection of transverse shaft
   cracks and seal face contact is discussed. {[}DOI:10.1115/1.4007275]}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the impact of random synchronization errors on the
   performance of ground-based telescope array receivers for an
   inter-planetary optical deep-space communication (ODSC) link is
   investigated. An adaptive method based on Kalman filters is developed
   for the synchronization and combination of different telescope signals
   in the array. An end-to-end simulation platform for ODSC link between
   Earth and planet Mars is implemented that incorporates pulse-position
   modulation (PPM), direct-detection array receivers, and photon-counting
   detectors. The effects of atmospheric turbulence and background noise
   are also modeled. The performance of array receivers is evaluated in
   terms of probability of symbol error and achievable data rates. The
   simulation results show that the Kalman filter-based synchronization
   scheme keeps the synchronization induced power losses to less than 1 dB.
   The analysis also shows that in the worst-case operational scenario and
   presence of random synchronization errors, an array consisting of
   hundred, 1 m telescopes performs almost similar to a single 10 m
   telescope. Hence, the degradation in the combined signal due to
   synchronization errors places a minor limitation on the number of
   telescopes in a telescope array receiver consisting of up to 100
   telescope elements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{186}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic tissue that
   contributes to organ integrity and function, and its regulation of cell
   phenotype is a major aspect of cell biology. However, standard in vitro
   culture approaches are of unclear physiologic relevance because they do
   not mimic the compositional, architectural, or distensible nature of a
   living organ. In the lung, fibroblasts exist in ECM-rich interstitial
   spaces and are key effectors of lung fibrogenesis.
   Objectives: To better address how ECM influences fibroblast phenotype in
   a disease-specific manner, we developed a culture system using acellular
   human normal and fibrotic lungs.
   Methods: Decellularization was achieved using treatment with detergents,
   salts, and DNase. The resultant matrices can be sectioned as uniform
   slices within which cells were cultured.
   Measurements and Main Results: We report that the decellularization
   process effectively removes cellular and nuclear material while
   retaining native dimensionality and stiffness of lung tissue. We
   demonstrate that lung fibroblasts reseeded into acellular lung matrices
   can be subsequently assayed using conventional protocols; in this manner
   we show that fibrotic matrices clearly promote transforming growth
   factor-beta-independent myofibroblast differentiation compared with
   normal matrices. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis of acellular matrix
   ECM details significant compositional differences between normal and
   fibrotic lungs, paving the way for further study of novel hypotheses.
   Conclusions: This methodology is expected to allow investigation of
   important ECM-based hypotheses in human tissues and permits future
   scientific exploration in an organ- and disease-specific manner.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the synthesis of Pd@MxCu1-x (M=Au, Pd, and Pt)
   nanocages with a yolkshell structure through galvanic replacement
   reactions that involve Pd@Cu coreshell nanocubes as sacrificial
   templates and ethylene glycol as the solvent. Compared with the most
   commonly used templates based on Ag, Cu offers a much lower reduction
   potential (0.34 versus 0.80 V), making the galvanic reaction more easily
   to conduct, even at room temperature. Our structural and compositional
   characterizations indicated that the products were hollow inside, and
   each one of them contained porous MCu alloy walls and a Pd cube in the
   interior. For the Pd@AuxCu1-x yolkshell nanocages, they displayed broad
   extinction peaks extending from the visible to the near-IR region. Our
   mechanistic study revealed that the dissolution of the Cu shell
   preferred to start from the slightly truncated corners and then
   progressed toward the interior, because the Cu \{100\} side faces were
   protected by a surface capping layer of hexadecylamine. This galvanic
   approach can also be extended to generating other hollow metal
   nanostructures by using different combinations of Cu nanostructures and
   salt precursors.}},

Abstract = {{To capture salient features of the flight dynamic behavior of some
   aircraft configurations, the air vehicle is best idealized as a
   multibody dynamic system where individual rigid bodies are connected via
   various joint connections. This paper considers automatic generation of
   a multibody air vehicle simulation where the standard six degrees of
   freedom rigid body modeling forms the basic kernel of the method. By
   adding an extra term to the individual body equations of motion
   representing joint connection constraint loads, a multibody flight
   dynamic model can be constructed. A globally stable nonlinear controller
   computes these constraint forces and moments. Through three modeling
   examples (projectile with an internal moving mass, airdrop system, and
   articulated wing aircraft), practical aspects of the methodology are
   explored. Many nonlinear control techniques can be used for the
   constraint control problem. Here, feedback linearization and sliding
   mode control algorithms are shown to work effectively. Constraint
   computation dominates overall simulation time, independently of the
   control algorithm used, and several means to reduce simulation time are
   reported. Moreover, unconstrained linear dynamic models can be generated
   by combining a linear model of the constrained coordinate equations of
   motion and a linear model of the constraint equations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and flight test of a completely
   self-contained autonomous indoor miniature unmanned aerial system
   (M-UAS). Guidance, navigation, and control algorithms are presented,
   enabling the M-UAS to autonomously explore cluttered indoor areas
   without relying on any off-board computation or external navigation aids
   such as Global Positioning Satellite (GPS). The system uses a scanning
   laser rangefinder and a streamlined simultaneous localization and
   mapping (SLAM) algorithm to provide a position and heading estimate,
   which is combined with other sensor data to form a six-degree-of-freedom
   inertial navigation solution. This enables an accurate estimate of the,
   vehicle attitude, relative position, and velocity. The state
   information, with a self-generated map, is used to implement a
   frontier-based exhaustive search of an indoor environment. Improvements
   to existing guidance algorithms balance exploration with the need to
   remain within sensor range of indoor structures such that the SLAM

Abstract = {{The effects of pressure and geometry scaling on the flow and combustion
   characteristics of gas gas injectors have been studied both numerically
   and experimentally. The chamber operating conditions cover a pressure
   range of 0.1-10 MPa, and the length varies from 0.125 to 0.25 m. The
   large-eddy simulation technique is used to achieve turbulence closure.
   Simulations of both pure mixing and combustion in model and prototype
   combustors at two different pressures are conducted to examine the flow,
   mixing, and combustion similarities for both the pressure and geometry
   scaling. Then hot-firing tests covering a pressure range of 0.92-6.1 MPa
   are conducted to measure the wall temperature. The temperature-increase
   profile indicates that all the combustion cases are similar. Finally the
   geometry scaling is also investigated experimentally with two
   geometrically similar combustors. Results show that similar
   temperature-increase profiles were obtained for the two combustors.
   Results of both numerical calculations and experimental measurements
   suggest that there are similarities of mixing and combustion flowfields
   for different chamber pressures and geometries when the injection and
   geometry conditions satisfy the given criteria, i.e., the injection
   temperature, velocity, and mixture ratio are fixed, gaseous
   hydrogen/gaseous oxygen shear coaxial injection, and the injector and
   combustor are geometrically similar.}},

Abstract = {{A new electric propulsion device concept takes advantage of residual
   helium gas that is trapped in the chemical propellant feed system and
   currently unused at end of life. The helium ion thruster provides
   additional propellant resources to extend satellite lifetimes and
   transfer geostationary orbit space assets to ultrasafe disposal orbits.
   The predicted capability, if fully allotted to the disposal, allows for
   perigee heights above the geostationary altitude that are one order of
   magnitude greater than existing international guidelines of similar to
   250 km. Furthermore, the proposed helium ion thruster concept makes the
   classic propellant gauge uncertainty problem moot, as satellite
   operators could use all of their conventional propellant for nominal
   station-keeping operations. The helium ion thruster concept therefore
   mitigates future space debris arising from depleted assets in the
   geostationary orbit belt through both aggressive orbit raising and
   depressurization of satellites at end of life. An analysis of the helium
   ion thruster theoretical performance shows that the device could raise
   the altitude of an end-of-life 2500 kg, 5 kW spacecraft by 2200 km in
   two months using 2 kg of residual helium.}},

Title = {{Emission guided radiation therapy for lung and prostate cancers: A
   feasibility study on a digital patient}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Accurate tumor tracking remains a challenge in current
   radiation therapy. Many strategies including image guided radiation
   therapy alleviate the problem to certain extents. The authors propose a
   new modality called emission guided radiation therapy (EGRT) to
   accurately and directly track the tumor based on its biological
   signature. This work is to demonstrate the feasibility of EGRT under two
   clinical scenarios using a 4D digital patient model.
   Methods: EGRT uses lines of response (LOR's) from positron emission
   events to direct beamlets of therapeutic radiation through the emission
   sites inside a tumor. This is accomplished by a radiation delivery
   system consisting of a Linac and positron emission tomography (PET)
   detectors on a fast rotating closed-ring gantry. During the treatment of
   radiotracer-administrated cancer patients, PET detectors collect LOR's
   from tumor uptake sites and the Linac responds in nearly real-time with
   beamlets of radiation along the same LOR paths. Moving tumors are
   therefore treated with a high targeting accuracy. Based on the EGRT
   concept, the authors design a treatment method with additional
   modulation algorithms including attenuation correction and an integrated
   boost scheme. Performance is evaluated using simulations of a lung tumor
   case with 3D motion and a prostate tumor case with setup errors. The
   emission process is simulated by Geant4 Application for Tomographic
   Emission package (GATE) and Linac dose delivery is simulated using a
   voxel-based Monte Carlo algorithm (VMC++).
   Results: In the lung case with attenuation correction, compared to a
   conventional helical treatment, EGRT achieves a 41\% relative increase
   in dose to 95\% of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a 55\% increase to
   50\% of the GTV. All dose distributions are normalized for the same dose
   to the lung. In the prostate case with the integrated boost and no setup
   error, EGRT yields a 19\% and 55\% relative dose increase to 95\% and
   50\% of the GTV, respectively, when all methods are normalized for the
   same dose to the rectum. In the prostate case with integrated boost
   where setup error is present, EGRT contributes a 21\% and 52\% relative
   dose increase to 95\% and 50\% of the GTV, respectively.
   Conclusions: As a new radiation therapy modality with inherent tumor
   tracking, EGRT has the potential to substantially improve targeting in
   radiation therapy in the presence of intrafractional and interfractional
   motion. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Currently, most of the reported noble-metal nanocrystals are limited to
   a high level of symmetry, as constrained by the inherent, face-centered
   cubic (fcc) lattice of these metals. In this paper, we report, for the
   first time, a facile and versatile approach (backed up by a clear
   mechanistic understanding) for breaking the symmetry of an fcc lattice
   and thus obtaining nanocrystals with highly unsymmetrical shapes. The
   key strategy is to induce and direct the growth of nanocrystal seeds
   into unsymmetrical modes by manipulating the reduction kinetics. With
   silver as an example, we demonstrated that the diversity of possible
   shapes taken by noble-metal nanocrystals could be greatly expanded by
   incorporating a series of new shapes drastically deviated from the fcc
   lattice. This work provides a new method to investigate shape-controlled
   synthesis of metal nanocrystal.}},

Abstract = {{A novel electrochemical electrode was prepared by transferring
   well-aligned, high-purity, open-end carbon nanotubes (CNTs) membrane,
   without any post-purification, onto the surface of glassy carbon
   electrodes (GCE) using Nafion as connection part. CNT membrane was made
   by a water-assisted selective etching chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   process. The electrochemical voltammetric properties of CNT/Nafion GCE
   were studied by detection low level of dopamine (DA) to verify the
   stability and sensitivity of this electrode in a biochemical sensor
   application. The detection limit of DA for this electrode can reach as
   low as 5 x 10(-8) M. By immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOD) on the
   above modified GCE, a GOD/CNT/Nafion GCE was obtained, and its
   electrochemical behavior and glucose sensor applications were
   investigated. The GOD/CNT/Nafion electrode can immobilize enzyme, and
   present two pairs of well-defined redox peaks and very good
   repetitiveness. The linear response range of glucose was about to be
   0-0.01 mol/L and the detection limit was about 0.001 mol/L. (c) 2012

Pages = {{482-500}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although the airline industry has benefited from advancements made in
   computational and operational research methods, most implementations
   arise from the frictionless environment of the planning stage. Because
   22\% of all flights have been delayed and 3\% have been cancelled in the
   United States since 2001, schedule perturbations are inevitable. The
   complexity of the operational environment is exacerbated by the need for
   obtaining a solution in as close to real-time as possible. Given some
   time horizon, the recovery process seeks to repair the flight schedule,
   aircraft rotations, crew schedule, and passenger itineraries in a
   tractable manner. Each component individually can be difficult to solve,
   so early research on irregular operations has studied these problems in
   isolation, leading to a sequential process by which the recovery process
   is conducted. Recent work has integrated a subset of these four
   components, usually abstracting from crew recovery. We present an
   optimization-based approach to solve the fully integrated airline
   recovery problem. After our solution methodology is presented, it is
   tested using data from an actual U.S. carrier with a dense hub-and-spoke
   network using a single-day horizon. It is shown that in several
   instances an integrated solution is delivered in a reasonable runtime.
   Moreover, we show the integrated approach can substantially improve the
   solution quality over the incumbent sequential approach. To the best of
   our knowledge, we are the first to present computational results on the
   fully integrated problem.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies based upon dynamic similarity have been used to
   evaluate the thermal performance of several modular helium-cooled
   tungsten divertor designs, including a configuration similar to the
   helium-cooled modular divertor with multiple jets (HEMJ). Until
   recently, all of these experiments used air, instead of helium, as the
   coolant. The average Nusselt number and loss coefficient were determined
   from cooled surface temperature and pressure drop data. Correlations
   were developed for the Nusselt number and loss coefficient as a function
   of the Reynolds number then used to predict the thermal performance of
   the divertor under prototypical conditions when cooled with
   high-temperature, high-pressure helium. Recently, experiments were
   performed using helium and argon to confirm the dynamic similarity
   assumption. The results indicated that the previous experiments with
   air, which were performed at the prototypical nondimensional coolant
   mass flow rate, or Reynolds number, did not account for the differences
   in the fraction of the incident power conducted through the walls of the
   divertor versus that convected, i.e., removed, by the coolant.
   Dimensional analysis and numerical simulations suggest that for a given
   divertor geometry this fraction can be characterized by the ratio of the
   thermal conductivities of the divertor material and the coolant. Nusselt
   number correlations were developed to include the effect of the thermal
   conductivity ratio. Based on these correlations, the predicted maximum
   heat flux values that can be accommodated by the HEMJ-like configuration
   are reduced by similar to 20\% from previous estimates. The results also
   suggest that the maximum heat flux that can be accommodated by this
   design can be increased by as much as 19\% by adding an array of
   cylindrical pin fins on the cooled pressure boundary. However, as
   expected, adding the fins increases the pumping power for the coolant by
   similar to 16\%. As a fraction of maximum total incident thermal power,
   however, the pumping power decreases by 2\% when the fins are added due
   to the significant increase in the maximum heat flux.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the optimization of components in a single-wavelength
   airborne laser bathymeter that is intended for a low-power unmanned
   aerial vehicle platform. The theoretical minimum energy requirement to
   detect the submerged sea floor in shallow (< 5 m) water using a low
   signal-to-noise ratio (LSNR) detection methodology is calculated.
   Results are presented from tests of a prototype light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) instrument that was developed by the University of
   Florida, Gainesville. A green wavelength (532 nm), 100-beamlet,
   low-energy (35-nJ/beamlet), short-pulse (480 ps) laser ranging system
   was operated from a low-altitude (500-m) aircraft, with a multichannel
   sensor that is capable of single photoelectron sensitivity and multiple
   stops. Data that were collected during tests display vertical structure
   in shallow-water areas based on fixed threshold crossings at a
   single-photon sensitivity level. A major concern for the binary
   detection strategy is the reliable identification and removal of noise
   events. Potential causes of ranging errors related to photomultiplier
   tube afterpulsing, impedance mismatching, and gain block overdrive are
   described. Data collection/processing solutions based on local density
   estimation are explored. Previous studies on LSNR performance metrics
   showed that short (15-cm) dead time could be expected in the case of
   multiple scattering objects, indicating the possibility of seamless
   topographic/bathymetric mapping with minimal discontinuity at the
   waterline. LiDAR depth estimates from airborne profiles are compared to
   on-site measurements, and near-shore submerged feature identification is
   presented.}},

Title = {{Descriptive Study of Case Scheduling and Cancellations Within 1 Week of
   the Day of Surgery}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA}},

Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: We performed a descriptive study of operating room (OR) case
   scheduling within 1 week of the day of surgery.
   METHODS: The data used were from the case scheduling and transaction
   audit tables of a hospital's anesthesia and OR information management
   systems. Each change to a scheduled case in the OR information system
   was captured in an audit table, including the date and time when the
   change was made. The timestamps allowed reconstruction of the elective
   OR schedule for each date of surgery at preceding dates (e.g., 2
   workdays ahead). The sample size was n = 17 consecutive 4-week periods.
   The allocated OR time, for each combination of service and day of the
   week, was the number of hours that minimized the inefficiency of use of
   OR time, a weighted combination of the hours of underutilized OR time
   and the more expensive hours of overutilized OR time. Data are reported
   as mean +/- SE.
   RESULTS: (1) The percentage of OR date combinations with at least 1
   add-on case was 24.1\% +/- 0.3\%. The most recent addition of a case to
   an OR occurred 1 working day before surgery for 22.3\% +/- 0.4\% of OR
   date combinations. At least half (51.5\% +/- 0.5\%) of ORs had its last
   case scheduled or changed within 2 working days of surgery. In addition,
   when allocated OR time was filled and the service scheduled additional
   case(s), the median time ahead when each such case was scheduled was 2.2
   +/- 0.2 workdays. Thus, managers can productively focus on the day of
   surgery starting 2 working days before surgery. (2) Once allocated time
   was full, the ratio of the net additional cases scheduled to the total
   number performed was 1.2\% +/- 0.6\%. However, 11.1\% +/- 1.7\% of the
   total were additional cases. Thus, schedulers should rely on the
   allocated time to be predictive of the actual (net) workload that will
   occur in the future, on the day of surgery. (3) For service and day
   combinations for which 2 working days ahead the scheduled hours exceeded
   the allocated hours, there was no significant net increase in minutes of
   cases scheduled (P = 0.79), unlike when the scheduled hours were less
   than allocated (P < 0.0001). Thus, additional hours of cases scheduled
   within the same number of workdays are heterogeneous both within and
   among services based on the prior hours of cases scheduled.
   CONCLUSIONS: Planning anesthesia assignments, ORs to target, etc., can
   be done productively starting 2 working days ahead of surgery. There are
   so many changes to the OR schedule those last 2 workdays that anesthesia
   groups should be engaged with the scheduling office during that period.
   The primary predictor of additional net hours of cases to be scheduled
   is the difference between the allocated (i.e., forecasted) OR time and
   the hours scheduled so far. (Anesth Analg 2012;115:1188-95)}},

Abstract = {{Osteoclasts are highly specialized cells that resorb bone and contribute
   to bone remodeling. Diseases such as osteoporosis and osteolytic bone
   metastasis occur when osteoclast-mediated bone resorption takes place in
   the absence of concurrent bone synthesis. Considerable effort has been
   placed on identifying molecules that regulate the bone resorption
   activity of osteoclasts. To this end, we investigated unique and
   overlapping functions of members of the FAK family (FAK and Pyk2) in
   osteoclast functions. With the use of a conditional knockout mouse
   model, in which FAK is selectively targeted for deletion in osteoclast
   precursors (FAK(Delta myeloid)), we found that loss of FAK resulted in
   reduced bone resorption by osteoclasts in vitro, coincident with
   impaired signaling through the CSF-1R. However, bone architecture
   appeared normal in FAK(Delta myeloid) mice, suggesting that Pyk2 might
   functionally compensate for reduced FAK levels in vivo. This was
   supported by data showing that podosome adhesion structures, which are
   essential for bone degradation, were significantly more impaired in
   osteoclasts when FAK and Pyk2 were reduced than when either molecule was
   depleted individually. We conclude that FAK contributes to cytokine
   signaling and bone resorption in osteoclasts and partially compensates
   for the absence of Pyk2 to maintain proper adhesion structures in these
   cells. J. Leukoc. Biol. 92: 1021-1028; 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies revealed increased renal cancer incidences and
   higher cancer mortalities in hypertensive individuals. Activation of the
   reninangiotensinaldosterone system leads to the formation of reactive
   oxygen species (ROS). In vitro, in renal cells, and ex vivo, in the
   isolated perfused mouse kidney, we could show DNA-damaging potential of
   angiotensin II (Ang II). Here, the pathway involved in the genotoxicity
   of Ang II was investigated. In kidney cell lines with properties of
   proximal tubulus cells, an activation of NADPH oxidase and the
   production of ROS, resulting in the formation of DNA strand breaks and
   micronuclei induction, was observed. This DNA damage was mediated by the
   Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), together with the G protein G(-q/11).
   Subsequently, phospholipase C (PLC) was activated and intracellular
   calcium increased. Both calcium stores of the endoplasmic reticulum and
   extracellular calcium were involved in the genotoxicity of Ang II.
   Downstream, a role for protein kinase C (PKC) could be detected, because
   its inhibition hindered Ang II from damaging the cells. Although PKC was
   activated, no involvement of its known target, the NADPH oxidase isoform
   containing the Nox2 subunit, could be found, as tested by
   small-interfering RNA down-regulation. Responsible for the DNA-damaging
   activity of Ang II was the NADPH oxidase isoform containing the Nox4
   subunit. In summary, in kidney cells the DNA-damaging activity of Ang II
   depends on an AT1R-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase via PLC, PKC and
   calcium signalling, with the NADPH subunit Nox4 playing a crucial role.}},

Abstract = {{In lithium-ion batteries, the electrochemical reaction between the
   electrodes and lithium is a critical process that controls the capacity,

   lithiation process of single-crystal silicon with atomic resolution. We
   observe a sharp interface (similar to 1 nm thick) between the
   crystalline silicon and an amorphous LixSi alloy. The lithiation
   kinetics are controlled by the migration of the interface, which occurs
   through a ledge mechanism involving the lateral movement of ledges on
   the close-packed \{111\} atomic planes. Such ledge flow processes
   produce the amorphous LixSi alloy through layer-by-layer peeling of the
   \{111\} atomic facets, resulting in the orientation-dependent mobility
   of the interfaces.}},

   for multifunctional composite structures}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Traditional multifunctional composite structures are produced by
   embedding parasitic parts, such as foil sensors, optical fibers and
   bulky connectors. As a result, the mechanical properties of the
   composites, especially the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), could be
   largely undermined. In the present study, we demonstrated an innovative
   aerosol-jet printing technology for printing electronics inside
   composite structures without degrading the mechanical properties. Using
   the maskless fine feature deposition (below 10 mu m) characteristics of
   this printing technology and a pre-cure protocol, strain sensors were
   successfully printed onto carbon fiber prepregs to enable fabricating
   composites with intrinsic sensing capabilities. The degree of pre-cure
   of the carbon fiber prepreg on which strain sensors were printed was
   demonstrated to be critical. Without pre-curing, the printed strain
   sensors were unable to remain intact due to the resin flow during
   curing. The resin flow-induced sensor deformation can be overcome by
   introducing 10\% degree of cure of the prepreg. In this condition, the
   fabricated composites with printed strain sensors showed almost no
   mechanical degradation (short beam shearing ILSS) as compared to the
   control samples. Also, the failure modes examined by optical microscopy
   showed no difference. The resistance change of the printed strain
   sensors in the composite structures were measured under a cyclic loading
   and proved to be a reliable mean strain gauge factor of 2.2 +/- 0.06,
   which is comparable to commercial foil metal strain gauge.}},

Abstract = {{Transplantation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) is currently in early
   clinical testing as a potential therapeutic strategy. Superoxide is
   increased in the ischemic myocardium and poor survival of cells is one
   of the major limitations of cell transplantation therapy. Superoxide
   dismutase (SOD) levels were analyzed in c-kit-positive CPCs isolated
   from rat myocardium to identify their roles in protection against
   oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in vitro. CPCs were subjected to
   oxidative stress using xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XXO) and little
   apoptosis was detected. CPCs contained significantly higher levels of
   SOD1 and SOD2 as compared with adult cardiac cell types, both at the
   protein and activity levels. Both SOD1 and SOD2 were increased by XXO at
   the mRNA and protein level, suggesting compensatory adaptation. Only
   knockdown of SOD2 and not SOD1 with siRNA sensitized the cells to
   XXO-apoptosis, despite only accounting for 10\% of total SOD levels.
   Finally, we found XXO activated Akt within 10 min, and this regulated
   both SOD2 gene expression and protection against apoptosis. Rat CPCs are
   resistant to superoxide-induced cell death, primarily through higher
   levels of SOD2 compared to adult cardiac-derived cells. Exposure to
   superoxide increases expression of SOD2 in an Akt-dependent manner and
   regulates CPC survival during oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Our laboratory has developed a tensile culture bioreactor as a system
   for understanding mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation toward a
   tendon/ligament fibroblast phenotype in response to cyclic tensile
   strain. In this study, we investigated whether increased degradability
   of the biomaterial carrier would induce changes in MSC morphology and
   subsequent upregulation of tendon/fibroblast markers under tensile
   strain. Degradability of a synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel was
   introduced by incorporating either fast-or slow-degrading matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive peptide sequences into the polymer
   backbone. Although a decline in cellularity was observed over culture in
   all sample groups, at 14 days, MSCs were significantly more spread in
   fast-cleaving gels (84\%+/- 8\%) compared with slow-cleaving gels
   (59\%+/- 4\%). Cyclic tensile strain upregulated tendon/ligament
   fibroblast-related genes, such as collagen III (3.8-fold vs. 2.1-fold in
   fast-degrading gels) and tenascin-C (2.5-fold vs. 1.7-fold in
   fast-degrading gels). However, few differences were observed in gene
   expression between different gel types. Immunostaining demonstrated
   increased collagen III deposition in dynamically strained gels at day
   14, as well as increased collagen I and tenascin-C deposition at day 14
   in all groups. Results suggest that cell spreading may not be a major
   factor controlling MSC response to cyclic strain in this system over 14
   days. However, these findings provide key parameters for the design of
   future biomaterial carriers and strain regimens to prime stem cells to a
   tendon/ligament phenotype prior to release and use in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve (MV) repair is a
   potential therapeutic option for patients presenting with mitral
   regurgitation, who may not be suitable for surgery. We characterized the
   edge-to-edge repair forces in a posterior leaflet flail MV model to
   identify potential modes of mechanical failure.
   Methods. Porcine MVs were evaluated in two different sizes (Physio II 32
   and 40) in a left-side heart simulator under physiologic hemodynamic
   conditions. Edge-to-edge repair was simulated by suturing miniature
   force transducers near the free edge of the anterior and posterior
   leaflets, on the ventricular side, resulting in a double orifice MV.
   Posterior leaflet flail was created by selective chordal cutting.
   Results. Chordal cutting resulted in posterior leaflet flail and mitral
   regurgitation; all valves coapted normally before chordal cutting. Peak
   systolic control forces (size 32, 0.098 +/- 0.058 N; size 40, 0.236 +/-
   0.149 N) were not significantly different from systolic flail forces
   (size 32, 0.136 +/- 0.107 N; size 40, 0.220 +/- 0.128 N) for either MV
   size. No correlation was observed between force magnitude and flail
   height or width. Peak systolic force was greater (p = 0.08) for the
   larger MVs (size 40 compared with size 32). Finally, peak diastolic
   force was significantly smaller (p = 0.04) than peak systolic force
   regardless of valve size.
   Conclusions. For the first time, forces imparted on an edge-to-edge MV
   repair were quantified for a posterior leaflet flail model. Force
   magnitude was not significantly altered with flail compared with
   control; it was greatest during peak systole and increased with valve
   size. (Ann Thorac Surg 2012;94:1446-54) (C) 2012 by The Society of

Abstract = {{The payload oscillation inherent to all cranes makes it challenging for
   human operators to manipulate payloads quickly, accurately, and safely.
   Manipulation difficulty is also increased by nonintuitive crane-control
   interfaces. This paper describes a new interface that allows operators
   to drive a crane by moving a hand-held device (wand or glove) freely in
   space. A crane-mounted camera tracks the movement of the hand-held
   device, the position of which is used to drive the crane. Two control
   architectures were investigated. The first uses a simple feedback
   controller, and the second uses feedback and an input shaper. Two
   operator studies demonstrate that hand-motion crane control is faster
   and safer than using a standard push-button pendent control.}},

Abstract = {{A novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is designed and investigated in
   this work. Barium-containing anode is employed for
   Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta(SDC)-based SOFC. SEM and EDX results show that barium
   diffuses from the anode to the electrolyte and a thin BaO-CeO2-Sm2O3
   ternary composite interlayer is formed in situ at elevated temperatures.
   The interlayer is electron-blocking, and eliminates the well-known
   internal short circuit in the SDC electrolyte membrane completely.
   Consequently, the open circuit voltages (OCVs) of the cell are improved
   significantly and achieve as high as 1.04, 1.06, 1.07, and 1.08 Vat 700,
   650, 600, and 550 degrees C, respectively, for the cell co-fired at 1350
   degrees C. Notably, the new cell still outputs 221 mW cm(-2) at a
   voltage of 0.9 V at 600 degrees C, while the traditional ceria-based
   cell cannot output any performance at all at such a high voltage. The
   results demonstrate that this novel structured cell exhibits great
   potential working at low temperatures at high efficiency. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Objective Meaningful exchange of information is a fundamental challenge
   in collaborative biomedical research. To help address this, the authors
   developed the Life Sciences Domain Analysis Model (LS DAM), an
   information model that provides a framework for communication among
   domain experts and technical teams developing information systems to
   support biomedical research. The LS DAM is harmonized with the
   Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model of
   protocol-driven clinical research. Together, these models can facilitate
   data exchange for translational research.
   Materials and methods The content of the LS DAM was driven by analysis
   of life sciences and translational research scenarios and the concepts
   in the model are derived from existing information models, reference
   models and data exchange formats. The model is represented in the
   Unified Modeling Language and uses ISO 21090 data types.
   Results The LS DAM v2.2.1 is comprised of 130 classes and covers several
   core areas including Experiment, Molecular Biology, Molecular Databases
   and Specimen. Nearly half of these classes originate from the BRIDG
   model, emphasizing the semantic harmonization between these models.
   Validation of the LS DAM against independently derived information
   models, research scenarios and reference databases supports its general
   applicability to represent life sciences research.
   Discussion The LS DAM provides unambiguous definitions for concepts
   required to describe life sciences research. The processes established
   to achieve consensus among domain experts will be applied in future
   iterations and may be broadly applicable to other standardization
   efforts.
   Conclusions The LS DAM provides common semantics for life sciences
   research. Through harmonization with BRIDG, it promotes interoperability
   in translational science.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Using numerical simulations the spatial and temporal evolution of the
   electrical conductivity in ionized gas mixtures produced by detonation
   is investigated in mixtures with and without potassium seeding. Without
   flow seeding, the magnitude of the electrical conductivity is observed
   to be too small for significant magnetohydrodynamic forces to affect the
   conducting flow. This is consistent with past observations. With
   potassium seeding the electrical conductivity can be increased by 4-5
   orders of magnitude, however, a critical percentage of seed particles is
   observed for which detonation is no longer sustainable. Therefore, there
   are limits to the electrical conductivity that can be achieved in burned
   gas mixtures. To further understand the dynamics of the physics involved
   a parametric study is conducted by varying the ambient pressure, the
   nitrogen dilution and the potassium seeding percentage. In order to
   reach these conclusions, a detailed kinetic mechanism of 26 species and
   65 reactions has been compiled from the available literature and
   validated for applications of detonation and ionization chemistry. From
   the computed mass fractions the mixture-averaged electrical conductivity
   is then computed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in computational methods have made realistic large-scale
   simulations of animal locomotion possible. This has resulted in numerous
   mathematical and computational studies of animal movement through fluids
   and over substrates with the purpose of better understanding organisms'
   performance and improving the design of vehicles moving through air and
   water and on land. This work has also motivated the development of
   improved numerical methods and modeling techniques for animal locomotion
   that is characterized by the interactions of fluids, substrates, and
   structures. Despite the large body of recent work in this area, the
   application of mathematical and numerical methods to improve our
   understanding of organisms in the context of their environment and
   physiology has remained relatively unexplored. Nature has evolved a wide
   variety of fascinating mechanisms of locomotion that exploit the
   properties of complex materials and fluids, but only recently are the
   mathematical, computational, and robotic tools available to rigorously
   compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of different methods
   of locomotion in variable environments. Similarly, advances in
   computational physiology have only recently allowed investigators to
   explore how changes at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels might
   lead to changes in performance at the organismal level. In this article,
   we highlight recent examples of how computational, mathematical, and
   experimental tools can be combined to ultimately answer the questions
   posed in one of the grand challenges in organismal biology:

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new adaptive control architecture for linear and
   nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems is developed to address the
   problem of high-gain adaptive control. Specifically, the proposed
   framework involves a new and novel controller architecture involving a
   modification term in the update law that minimizes an error criterion
   involving the distance between the weighted regressor vector and the
   weighted system error states. This modification term allows for fast
   adaptation without hindering system robustness. In particular, we show
   that the governing tracking closed-loop system error equation
   approximates a Hurwitz linear time-invariant dynamical system with L8
   inputoutput signals. This key feature of our framework allows for robust
   stability analysis of the proposed adaptive control law using L1 system
   theory. We further show that by properly choosing the design parameters
   in the modification term, we can guarantee a desired bandwidth of the
   adaptive controller, guaranteed transient closed-loop performance, and
   an a priori characterization of the size of the ultimate bound of the
   closed-loop system trajectories. Several illustrative numerical examples
   are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract = {{A hybrid evolutionary design synthesis and optimization process for
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices has been developed. The
   process integrates a MEMS design component library with multiple
   simulation modules and two levels of design optimization: global
   multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) and local gradient-based
   refinement. During the hybrid evolutionary design process, MOGA randomly
   searches the design space and approaches the desirable design solutions
   using probabilistic transition rules, and gradient-based local
   optimization refines promising design candidates with computational
   efficiency. To efficiently apply hybrid evolutionary optimization
   techniques on MEMS designs, a hierarchical tree-structured
   component-based genotype representation has been developed, which
   incorporates specific engineering knowledge into the design synthesis
   and optimization process. The MEMS design component library serves as a
   source of practical and efficient genotypes for the evolutionary
   process, with each component associated with its instructions and
   restrictions on genetic operations. The component-based genotype
   incorporated with engineering knowledge constrains evolutionary
   searching in appropriate and promising regions of the search space,
   allowing a deeper search in a given amount of time. Hybrid evolutionary
   MEMS design synthesis and optimization are demonstrated with
   surface-micromachined resonator and accelerometer designs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes numerical and theoretical analyses of the nonlinear
   dynamics of harmonically forced, stretch-sensitive premixed flames. A
   key objective of this work is to analyze the relative contributions of
   kinematic restoration and flame stretch upon the rate at which flame
   wrinkles, excited by harmonic forcing, are smoothed out. Kinematic
   restoration is an intrinsically nonlinear process with a two
   spatial-zone structure, whose amplitude dependence is fundamentally
   different near and far from the wrinkle excitation source. Flame stretch
   processes appear even in the small perturbation limit, and smooth out
   flame wrinkles in thermodiffusively stable mixtures. Which process
   dominates is a function of the perturbation amplitude, frequency,
   stretch sensitivity of the mixture, and spatial location. This paper
   presents computed results illustrating the solution characteristics, as
   well as key dimensionless parameters controlling the solution based upon
   a third order perturbation analysis. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {{Gas condensate reservoirs denote an important source of hydrocarbon
   reserves and have long been identified as a reservoir type, possessing
   the most complicated flow and complex thermodynamic behaviors. On the
   other hand, collection of a sample that dependably represents the
   reservoir fluid is vital in simulation and flow behavior considerations
   particularly for gas condensate reservoir fluids.
   Because of multiphase flow in near well bore region, even during early
   depletion stages, recombined separator or directly obtained bottom-hole
   samples may not represent original reservoir fluid. The problem becomes
   more complex when \textbackslash{}the average pressure declines below
   saturation one and consequently condensate saturation distributes in
   whole drainage area. As a consequent, reservoir fluid should be sampled
   as early as possible during the production life of a reservoir.
   This paper presents a novel and relatively simple method for
   determination of representative initial fluid of a depleted-saturated
   lean gas condensate reservoir, using at least available data of original
   fluid including dew point pressure and producing GOR properties. The
   procedure was supported by thermodynamic PVT programs and reservoir
   simulations. An equation of state based PVT program was expertly tuned
   with properties of an assumed initial fluid sample and was used in the
   phase behavior deliberation and reservoir simulation. Suitable
   conditions for sampling are also investigated. Comparative studies show
   that recombination with simultaneous matching of GOR and dew point
   pressure can trace back initial reservoir fluid acceptably. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Clinical efforts to repair cartilage defects delivering cells or

   success. This study used a critical-size chondral defect model in
   immunocompromised rat xiphoid cartilage to test whether endogenous
   chondrogenesis could be achieved using human bone matrix scaffolds to
   deliver human cartilage particles and/or a variant isoform of fibroblast
   growth factor-2 (FGF2-variant). Seventy-two male athymic RNU rats were
   enrolled in this study with eight rats per experimental group.
   Decellularized and demineralized human bone matrix scaffolds loaded with
   human articular cartilage particles or heat-inactivated cartilage
   particles were combined with different doses of the FGF2-variant.
   Scaffolds were implanted into 3-mm-diameter critical-size defects
   prepared using a biopsy punch through the center of the xiphoid. The
   samples were evaluated 28 days postsurgery using X-ray, equilibrium
   partitioning of ionic contrast microcomputed tomography, and safranin
   O-stained histological sagittal sections. Scaffolds containing cartilage
   particles plus the FGF2-variant induced dose-dependent increases in the
   formation of neocartilage (p < 0.05), which was distributed
   homogeneously throughout the defects in comparison to scaffolds
   containing only the FGF2-variant. These effects were less pronounced
   when scaffolds with heat-inactivated cartilage particles were used.
   These results demonstrate that endogenous repair of chondral defects can
   be achieved in the absence of exogenous cells or bone marrow, suggesting
   that a similar approach may be successful for treating chondral lesions
   clinically.}},

Title = {{A DTI tractography analysis of infralimbic and prelimbic connectivity in

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: High throughput, brain-wide analysis of neural circuit
   connectivity is needed to understand brain function across species.
   Combining such tractography techniques with small animal models will
   allow more rapid integration of systems neuroscience with molecular
   genetic, behavioral, and cellular approaches.
   Methods: We collected DTI and 12 scans on 3 series of 6 fixed mouse
   brains ex vivo in a 9.4 Tesla magnet. The DTI analysis of ten mouse
   brains focused on comparing prelimbic (PL) and Infralimbic (IL)
   probabilistic tractography. To validate the DTI results a preliminary
   set of 24 additional mice were injected with BDA into the IL and PL. The
   DTI results and preliminary BOA results were also compared to previously
   published rat connectivity.
   Results: We focused our analyses on the connectivity of the mouse
   prelimbic (PL) vs. infralimbic (IL) cortices. We demonstrated that this
   DTI analysis is consistent across scanned mice, with prior analyses of
   rat IL/PL connectivity, and with mouse PL and IL projections using the
   BOA tracer.
   Conclusions: High-throughput ex vivo DTI imaging in the mouse delineated
   both common and differential connectivity of the IL and PL cortex. The
   scanning methodology provided a balance of tissue contrast,
   signal-to-noise ratio, resolution and throughput. Our results are
   largely consistent with previously published anterograde staining
   techniques in rats, and the preliminary tracer study of the mouse IL and
   PL provided here. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of monolayer graphene is the key to graphene's practical
   applications. Herein we report a facile and scalable technique to grow
   monolayer graphene on Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe surfaces using an etching-aided
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The growth was performed using
   an additional step of hydrogen etching in atmospheric pressure CVD after
   stopping the carbon supply. The etching of formed multi-layer graphene
   for Cu substrates assists the formation of monolayer graphene. The
   etching of excessive dissolved carbon for Ni, Co, and Fe substrates
   really helps to suppress the troublesome carbon precipitation which is
   believed to cause the non-uniform thickness of the produced graphene. We
   believe this technique is not only limited to Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe
   surfaces but also can be extend to other metal substrates such as Pt,
   Au, Pd, and Ru if choosing appropriate carbon precursors. We also found
   out that by varying the time of hydrogen exposure both monolayer and
   bilayer graphene were successfully synthesized on Ni surfaces. Metal
   substrates with high carbon solubility in them seem to hold great
   advantages in the layer-controlled synthesis of graphene. Our findings
   open a new pathway for an efficient growth of monolayer graphene and
   will facilitate graphene research. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reducing energy consumption has been an important design issue for
   large-scale streaming media storage systems. Existing energy
   conservation techniques are inadequate to achieve high energy efficiency
   for streaming media computing environments due to high data migration
   overhead. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a new
   energy-efficient method called Explicit Energy Saving Disk Cooling or
   EESDC. EESDC significantly reduces data migration overhead because of
   two reasons. First, a set of disks referred to Explicit Energy Saving
   Disks (EESD) is explicitly fixed according to temporal system load.
   Second, all the migrated data in EESDC directly contribute on extending
   the idle time of EESD to conserve more energy efficiently. Therefore,
   the EESDC method is conducive to saving more energy by quickly achieving
   energy-efficient data layouts without unnecessary data migrations. We
   implement EESDC in a simulated disk system, which is validated against a
   prototype system powered by our EESDC. Our experimental results using
   both real-world traces and synthetic traces show that EESDC can save up
   to 28.13-29.33 percent energy consumption for typical streaming media
   traces. Energy efficiency of streaming media storage systems can be
   improved by 3.3-6.0 times when EESDC is coupled.}},

Abstract = {{3-D integration has the potential to increase performance and decrease
   energy consumption. However, there are many unsolved issues in the
   design of these systems. In this work we study the design of 3-D power
   supply networks and demonstrate a technique specific to 3-D systems that
   improves IR-drop and dynamic noise over a straightforward extension of
   traditional design techniques. Previous work in 3-D power delivery
   network design has simply extended 2-D techniques by treating
   through-silicon vias (TSVs) as extensions of the C4 bumps. By exploiting
   the smaller size and much higher interconnect density possible with TSVs
   we demonstrate significant reduction of nearly 50\% in the IR-drop and
   42\% in the dynamic noise of our large-scale 3-D design. Simulations
   also show that a 3-tier stack with the distributed TSV topology actually
   lowers IR-drop by 21\% and dynamic noise by 32\% over a non-3-D system
   with less power dissipation. We analyze the power distribution network
   of an envisioned 1000-core processor with 30 stacked dies and show
   scaling trends related to both increased stacking and power distribution
   TSVs. Finally, we examine several techniques for minimizing IR-drop and
   dynamic noise and their effects on our large-scale 3-D system.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{45-57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical models used to simulate the complete behavior of
   full-scale bolted T-stub connections under cyclic loads are mainly
   treated in this paper. These mechanical models are composed of
   individual T-stub components modeled as nonlinear spring elements in
   order to reliably reproduce their various response mechanisms
   interacting with one another in the connection. The hysteresis behaviors
   of the T-stub components including bolt/flange uplift, stem elongation,
   and relative slip deformation combined with bolt bearing are simulated
   by the multi-linear cyclic stiffness models characterized from their
   actual force-deformation response mechanisms each. The nonlinear
   component springs, which contain these idealized stiffness properties,
   are implemented into the user joint element produced based on the
   mechanical model so as to numerically generate the complete behavior of
   the full-scale connections with considerable accuracy. The analytical
   predictions performed on the joint element are evaluated against the
   experimental tests with respect to stiffness, strength, and deformation.
   Thus, the adequacy of the proposed modeling approach is verified through
   comparisons between analytical predictions and experimental test
   results. Finally, it can be shown that the mechanical model proposed in
   this study has the satisfactory potential to predict the response of the
   T-stub components as well as the behavior of the T-stub connections
   through analytical studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   recorded as one of the largest earthquakes of the last century. The
   ground motion records from large subduction earthquakes, such as the
   Chile earthquake, are sparse. The number of accelerograms that recorded
   the strong ground motion was relatively few and only a few of these
   ground motions were released to engineering community. One of the
   objectives of this paper is to develop site specific ground motions that
   take into account the particular characteristics of this major
   earthquake. These are proposed to the engineering community as
   representative ground motions based on the best available data. The
   second objective of the paper is to investigate, using numerical tools,
   some typical failures observed in the engineered buildings and bridges.
   Although, in general engineered structures performed very well and the
   majority of failures, hence losses, were to non-engineered structures,
   some repeated deficiencies in structural design were observed. The
   developed hazard and site specific ground motions are used as inputs for
   inelastic dynamic analysis of advanced finite element building and
   bridge models. The results are processed to explain quantitatively the
   structural deficiencies observed in the field. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death, with few options to
   retain ventricular function following myocardial infarction.
   Hematopoietic-derived progenitor cells contribute to angiogenesis and
   tissue repair following ischemia reperfusion injury. Motivated by the
   role of bone marrow extracellular matrix (BM-ECM) in supporting the
   proliferation and regulation of these cell populations, we investigated
   BM-ECM injection in myocardial repair. In BM-ECM isolated from porcine
   sternum, we identified several factors important for myocardial healing,
   including vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth
   factor-2, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB. We further determined
   that BM-ECM serves as an adhesive substrate for endothelial cell
   proliferation. Bone marrow ECM was injected in a rat model of myocardial
   infarction, with and without a methylcellulose carrier gel. After one
   day, reduced infarct area was noted in rats receiving BM-ECM injection.
   After seven days we observed improved fractional shortening, decreased
   apoptosis, and significantly lower macrophage counts in the infarct
   border. Improvements in fractional shortening, sustained through 21
   days, as well as decreased fibrotic area, enhanced angiogenesis, and
   greater c-kit-positive cell presence were associated with BM-ECM
   injection. Notably, the concentrations of BM-ECM growth factors were
   10(3)-10(8) fold lower than typically required to achieve a beneficial
   effect, as reported in pre-clinical studies that have administered
   single growth factors alone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The slab-thickness dependence of the photonic bandgap in air-bridge
   photonic-crystal slabs was theoretically investigated by the 3-D
   plane-wave expansion method. The photonic bandgap was found to achieve a
   maximum for a certain slab thickness depending on air-hole volume
   filling factor. A kink in the photonic bandgap width versus slab
   thicknesses was observed, and found to be due to a transition in the
   nature of the modes at the top of the bandgap. Through a systematic
   investigation, a linear relation between the optimized slab thickness
   for the maximum photonic bandgap versus air-volume filling factor was
   found to hold over a wide range of air-volume filling factors. The
   linear relation also holds for photonic-crystal slabs composed of other
   materials and would favor the design and application of various 2-D
   photonic-crystal-slab devices such as reflectors, cavities, and
   waveguides.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, many information networks have become available for
   analysis, including social networks, road networks, sensor networks,
   biological networks, etc. Graph clustering has shown its effectiveness
   in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goal of graph
   clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into clusters based
   on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood
   similarity. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the
   topological structures, but largely ignore the vertex properties which
   are often heterogeneous. Recently, a new graph clustering algorithm,
   SA-cluster, has been proposed which combines structural and attribute
   similarities through a unified distance measure. SA-Cluster performs
   matrix multiplication to calculate the random walk distances between
   graph vertices. As part of the clustering refinement, the graph edge
   weights are iteratively adjusted to balance the relative importance
   between structural and attribute similarities. As a consequence, matrix
   multiplication is repeated in each iteration of the clustering process
   to recalculate the random walk distances which are affected by the edge
   weight update. In order to improve the efficiency and scalability of
   SA-cluster, in this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm In-Cluster
   to incrementally update the random walk distances given the edge weight
   increments. Complexity analysis is provided to estimate how much runtime
   cost Inc-Cluster can save. We further design parallel matrix computation
   techniques on a multicore architecture. Experimental results demonstrate
   that Inc-Cluster achieves significant speedup over SA-Cluster on large
   graphs, while achieving exactly the same clustering quality in terms of
   intra-cluster structural cohesiveness and attribute value homogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{A unified model framework with online-coupled meteorology and chemistry
   and consistent model treatments across spatial scales is required to
   realistically simulate
   chemistry-aerosol-cloud-radiation-precipitation-climate interactions. In
   this work, a global-through-urban WRF/Chem model (i.e., GU-WRF/Chem) has
   been developed to provide such a unified model framework to simulate
   these important interactions across a wide range of spatial scales while
   reducing uncertainties from the use of offline-coupled model systems
   with inconsistent model treatments. Evaluation against available
   observations shows that GU-WRF/Chem is capable of reproducing
   observations with comparable or superior fidelity than existing
   mesoscale models. The net effect of atmospheric aerosols is to decrease
   shortwave and longwave radiation, NO2 photolysis rate, near-surface
   temperature, wind speed at 10-m, planetary boundary layer height, and
   precipitation as well as to increase relative humidity at 2-m, aerosol
   optical depths, column cloud condensation nuclei, cloud optical
   thickness, and cloud droplet number concentrations at all scales. As
   expected, such feedbacks also change the abundance and lifetimes of
   chemical species through changing radiation, atmospheric stability, and
   the rates of many meteorologically-dependent chemical and microphysical
   processes. The use of higher resolutions in progressively nested domains
   from the global to local scale notably improves the model performance of
   some model predictions (especially for chemical predictions) and also
   captures spatial variability of aerosol feedbacks that cannot be
   simulated at a coarser grid resolution. Simulated aerosol, radiation,
   and cloud properties exhibit small-to-high sensitivity to various
   nucleation and aerosol activation parameterizations. Representing one of
   the few unified global-through-urban models, GU-WRF/Chem can be applied
   to simulate air quality and its interactions with meteorology and
   climate and to quantify the impact of global change on urban/regional
   air quality across various spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Topological subsystem codes were proposed by Bombin based on
   3-face-colorable cubic graphs. Suchara, Bravyi, and Terhal generalized
   this construction and proposed a method to construct topological
   subsystem codes using 3-valent hypergraphs that satisfy certain
   constraints. Finding such hypergraphs and computing their parameters,
   however, is a nontrivial task. We propose families of topological
   subsystem codes that were previously not known. In particular, our
   constructions give codes which cannot be derived from Bombin's
   construction. We also study the error recovery schemes for the proposed
   subsystem codes and give detailed schedules for the syndrome measurement
   that take advantage of the 2-locality of the gauge group. The study also
   leads to a new and general construction for color codes.}},

   equilibrium, speeds and rates of conformational changes, and the impact
   of divalent cations and tensile forces. We quantified how initial and
   subsequent conformations of alpha(L)beta(2) regulate the force-dependent
   kinetics of dissociation from intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Our
   findings provide new insights into how integrins function as
   nanomachines to precisely control cell adhesion and signaling.}},

Title = {{Nucleation and arrest of dynamic slip on a pressurized fault}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Elevated pore pressure can lead to reactivation of slip on pre-existing
   fractures and faults when the static Coulomb failure is reached locally.
   As the pressurized region spreads diffusively, slip can accumulate
   quasi-statically (paced by the pore fluid diffusion) or dynamically. In
   this work, we consider a prestressed fault with a locally peaked,
   diffusively spreading pore pressure field to study (1) conditions
   leading to the escalation of slip and nucleation of dynamic rupture and
   (2) rupture run-out distance before it is arrested. Nucleation appears
   in this model when the fault friction decreases from its peak value with
   slip, while arrest of dynamic propagation is imminent on aseismic faults
   (i.e., such that prestress tau(b) is less than the residual fault
   strength tau(r) at ambient conditions). When fluid overpressure is a
   small-to-moderate fraction of the ambient value of normal effective
   stress (and prestress is large enough for fault slip to be activated by
   overpressure), dynamic rupture always nucleates, and the nucleation
   length increases with decreasing prestress practically independently of
   the overpressure value. Transition from the ultimately unstable (tau(b)
   > tau(r)) to the ultimately stable (tau(b) < tau(r)) fault loading is
   marked by a strong increase of the nucleation length (proportional to
   1/(tau(b) - tau(r))(2)) as tau(b) approaches tau(r) from above. For
   aseismic faults (tau(b) < tau(r)), no dynamic rupture is nucleated at
   large fluid overpressures for all but the smallest values of prestress.
   The largest run-out distances of dynamic slip on aseismic faults
   correspond to overpressure/prestress just sufficient for slip
   activation. In such cases, the dynamically accumulated slip can lead to
   enhanced, dynamic fault weakening, resulting in a sustained dynamic
   rupture and generating a large earthquake. This is consistent with field
   observations when the largest injection-induced seismicity occurred
   after fluid injection ended.}},

Abstract = {{We study vertical jumping in a simple robot comprising an actuated
   mass-spring arrangement. The actuator frequency and phase are
   systematically varied to find optimal performance. Optimal jumps occur
   above and below (but not at) the robot's resonant frequency f(0). Two
   distinct jumping modes emerge: a simple jump, which is optimal above
   f(0), is achievable with a squat maneuver, and a peculiar stutter jump,
   which is optimal below f(0), is generated with a countermovement. A
   simple dynamical model reveals how optimal lift-off results from
   nonresonant transient dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and controlling how carbon nanotubes interact with
   phospholipid membranes is necessary for preventing adverse effects of
   these relatively new, but still exciting, materials. Futuristic
   applications envision incorporating carbon nanotubes in liposomes for
   personalized medicine, controlled delivery, and imaging. Because of
   their ability to penetrate phospholipid bilayers, nanotubes could serve
   as nanoscale syringes to deliver molecular cargo and develop gene
   therapy. Several experimental reports available on the subject
   demonstrate the need for a better understanding, at the molecular level,
   of whether carbon nanotubes penetrate, reside, and perturb phospholipid
   bilayers. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we quantify how
   short carbon nanotubes (similar to 6 nm in length) embedded within a
   DOPC phospholipid membrane perturb the structure, organization, and
   dynamics of the lipid molecules within the membrane. It is found that
   the structural perturbation is very short-ranged, although it becomes
   pronounced when bundles of carbon nanotubes are formed within the
   membrane. The presence of the nanotubes is found to reduce the mobility
   of lipid molecules within the membrane and to perturb the structure of
   interfacial water. Our observations suggest that the local perturbations
   in the lipid structure caused by the nanotubes could lead to enhanced
   penetration of molecular compounds across the membrane.}},

   in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy

   degrees C, the Na2Nb2O6-H2O becomes significantly destabilized and
   transforms into NaNbO3 with the increase of time. The phase
   transformation time is exponentially proportional to the inverse of
   temperature, for example, similar to 10(5) is at 300 degrees C and
   similar to 10(1) at 500 degrees C, and follows an Arrhenius equation
   with the activation energy of 2.0 eV. Real time TEM investigation
   directly reveals that the phase transformation occurs through a
   thermally excited atomic rearrangement due to the small difference of
   Gibbs free energy between two phases. This work may provide a clue of

Abstract = {{The influence of pore size, relative block size, and solvent quality on
   the extent of diblock copolymer adsorption on alumina surfaces was
   determined. To this end, the block copolymer that was chosen was
   poly(styrene)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA), in which the PMMA
   block strongly chemisorbs to the surface and the PS block weakly
   physisorbs. Several architectures (i.e., different ratios of and (M)
   over bar (nPMMA) and (M) over bar (nPS)) of the PS-b-PMMA copolymers
   were adsorbed from various solvents onto porous alumina membranes with
   various pore sizes. It was determined that the diblock copolymer
   coverage decreased significantly as the pore size decreased, similar to
   the behavior of the PMMA homopolymer under the same conditions. However,
   the coverage decreased as the molecular weight of the anchoring block
   (PMMA) increased for all pore sizes, which is in contrast to the
   behavior of the PMMA homopolymer under the same conditions. The
   dependence of the coverage on the relative block size and solvent
   quality is analyzed on the basis of the anchor-buoy model and the
   deviation from it in a nonideal system. The results presented In this
   work are relevant to the study of block copolymer conformation in
   solutions and on surfaces, adsorption chromatography, and solvent
   sensors and controls.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrated the seamless integration of 57.2-Gb/s
   signal wireline transmission and 100-GHz wireless delivery adopting
   polarization-division-multiplexing quadrature-phase-shift-keying
   (PDM-QPSK) modulation with 400-km single-mode fiber-28 (SMF-28)
   transmission and 1-m wireless delivery. The X- and Y-polarization
   components of optical PDM-QPSK baseband signal are simultaneously
   up-converted to 100 GHz by optical polarization-diversity heterodyne
   beating, and then independently transmitted and received by two pairs of
   transmitter and receiver antennas, which make up a 2x2 multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) wireless link based on microwave polarization
   multiplexing. At the wireless receiver, a two-stage down conversion is
   firstly done in analog domain based on balanced mixer and sinusoidal
   radio frequency (RF) signal, and then in digital domain based on digital
   signal processing (DSP). Polarization de-multiplexing is realized by
   constant modulus algorithm (CMA) based on DSP in heterodyne coherent
   detection. Our experimental results show that more taps are required for
   CMA when the X- and Y-polarization antennas have different wireless
   distance. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel secure communication technique using
   constellation masking for applications in orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing passive optical network (OFDM-PON). The constellation
   masking is applied both on each subcarrier and among different
   subcarriers. The Arnold mapping is utilized as the parameter function
   for the mask factors. A interleave length is employed to provide a
   scalable masking granularity for different ONUs. A 15.54 Gb/s
   constellation-masked 32QAM-OFDM signal has been successfully transmitted
   over 25-km single mode fiber in the experiment. Experimental results
   show that the proposed scheme can effectively protect the system from
   illegal ONU without wasting the bandwidth. The constellation-masked
   technique suggests an effective solution for the physical secure

Abstract = {{Piperlongumine (piplartine, PL) is an alkaloid found in the long pepper
   (Piper longum L) and has well-documented anti-platelet aggregation,
   anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties; however, the role of PL
   in prevention of atherosclerosis is unknown. We evaluated the
   anti-atherosclerotic potential of PL in an in vivo murine model of
   accelerated atherosclerosis and defined its mechanism of action in
   aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. Local treatment
   with PL significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation as well
   as proliferation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in
   an in vivo setting. PL treatment in VSMCs in vitro showed inhibition of
   migration and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB)-induced
   proliferation to the in vivo findings. We further identified that PL
   inhibited PDGF-BB-induced PDGF receptor beta activation and suppressed
   downstream signaling molecules such as phospholipase C gamma 1,
   extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and Akt. Lastly, PL
   significantly attenuated activation of NF-kappa B-a downstream
   transcriptional regulator in PDGF receptor signaling, in response to
   PDGF-BB stimulation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a novel,
   therapeutic mechanism by which PL suppresses atherosclerosis plaque
   formation in vivo. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Computationally efficient determination of hydrogen isotope effects on
   the thermodynamic stability of metal hydrides}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Although the thermodynamics of metal hydrides at low to moderate
   temperatures has been successfully described with density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations using 0 K total energies and simple harmonic
   models, it is unclear if this approach is valid for hydrides that are
   stable at high temperatures. To aid development of computationally
   efficient methods, this paper uses DFT to explore the predicted
   stabilities of ZrH2, HfH2, TiH2, LiH, and NaH with four levels of
   theory. We also investigate isotope effects to understand if these
   should be accounted for in screening of deuterated or tritiated
   materials. We show that calculations that account for vibrational
   corrections to the crystal lattice are not necessary to get an accurate
   description of relative stabilities of metal hydrides. The shifts in
   dissociation temperatures due to isotope substitutions are <50 K for all
   materials, with larger shifts for lighter materials, as expected. We
   show that accounting for vibrational effects due to isotope substitution
   in metal hydrides is unnecessary to accurately predict the relative
   stabilities of metal hydrides at high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Vigorous mixing of an aqueous particle dispersion with oil usually
   produces a particle-stabilized emulsion (a ``Pickering emulsion{''}),
   the longevity of which depends on the particles' wetting properties. A
   known exception occurs when particles fail to adsorb to the oil water
   interface created during mixing because of a strong repulsion between
   charges on the particle surface and similar charges on the oil water
   interface; in this case, no Pickering emulsion is formed. Here, we
   present experimental evidence that the rarely considered electrostatic
   image force can cause a much bigger hindrance to particle adsorption and
   prevent the formation of Pickering emulsions even when the particle
   interaction with the interface charge is attractive. A simple
   theoretical estimate confirms the observed magnitude of this effect and
   points at an important limitation of Pickering emulsification, a
   technology with widespread industrial applications and increasing
   popularity in materials research and development.}},

Abstract = {{This feature article introduces our recent work on understanding the

   of Ag nanocrystals enclosed preferentially by \{111\} or \{100\} facets.
   In addition, we have quantified the coverage density of PVP adsorbed on
   the surface of Ag nanocubes. On the basis of the mechanistic
   understanding, a series of Ag nanocrystals with controlled shapes and
   sizes have been successfully synthesized by using different combinations
   of seeds and capping agents: single-crystal spherical/cubic seeds with

Abstract = {{In today's retail business many companies have a complex distribution
   network with several national and regional distribution centers. This
   article studies an integrated facility location and inventory allocation
   problem for designing a distribution network with multiple distribution
   centers and retailers. The key decisions are where to locate the
   regional distribution centers (RDCs), how to assign retail stores to
   RDCs and what should be the inventory policy at the different locations
   such that the total network cost is minimized. Due to the complexity of
   the problem, a continuous approximation (CA) model is used to represent
   the network. Nonlinear programming techniques are developed to solve the
   optimization problems. The main contribution of this work lies in
   developing a new CA modeling technique when the discrete data cannot be
   modeled by a continuous function and applying this technique to solve an
   integrated facility location-allocation and inventory-management
   problem. Our methodology is illustrated with the network from a leading
   US retailer. Numerical analysis suggests that the total cost is
   significantly lower in the case of the integrated model as compared with
   the non-integrated model, where the location-allocation and
   inventory-management problems are considered separately. This paper also
   studies the effects of changing parameter values on the optimal
   solutions and to point out some management implications. (c) 2012

Title = {{Intraoperative Near-Infrared Imaging of Surgical Wounds after Tumor
   Resections Can Detect Residual Disease}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{5741-5751}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Surgical resection remains the most effective therapy for solid
   tumors worldwide. The most important prognostic indicator for cure
   following cancer surgery is a complete resection with no residual
   disease. However, intraoperative detection of retained cancer cells
   after surgery is challenging, and residual disease continues to be the
   most common cause of local failure. We hypothesized that visual
   enhancement of tumors using near-infrared imaging could potentially
   identify tumor deposits in the wound after resection.
   Experimental Design: A small animal model of surgery and retained
   disease was developed. Residual tumor deposits in the wound were
   targeted using an U. S. Food and Drug Administration-approved imaging
   agent, indocyanine green, by the enhanced permeability and retention
   effect. A novel handheld spectrometer was used to optically visualize
   retained disease after surgery.
   Results: We found residual disease using near-infrared imaging during
   surgery that was not visible to the naked eye or micro-CT. Furthermore,
   examination of tumor nodules was remarkably precise in delineating
   margins from normal surrounding tissues. This approach was most
   successful for tumors with increased neovasculature.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that near-infrared examination of the
   surgical wound after curative resection can potentially enable the
   surgeon to locate residual disease. The data in this study is the basis
   of an ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial in patients who undergo
   resection for lung and breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 18(20); 5741-51.

Abstract = {{Data and analysis are presented for the study of efficiency droop in
   visible Ill-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) considering the effects
   of both electron spill-over out of active region and hole injection into
   the active region. Performance characteristics of blue LEDs with
   lattice-matched In0.18Al0.82N electron-blocking layers (EBLs) with
   different thicknesses were measured in order to exclude the effects of
   strain and doping efficiency of the EBL, and the quantum efficiencies
   were analyzed taking account of the electron spill-over current and the
   relative hole concentration. The results suggest that the highest
   efficiency in LEDs with a 15-nm In0.18Al0.82N EBL is due to relatively
   lower hole-blocking effect, hence higher hole injection than in LEDs
   with a 20-nm EBL, while providing a higher potential barrier for reduced
   electron spill-over than in LEDs with thinner EBLs. This study suggests
   that the EBL hole-blocking and electron-confinement effects should be
   considered in order to achieve higher light output power and reduced
   efficiency droop at high currents. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate the
   thermal and mechanical responses of GaN nanowires with the {[}0001]
   orientation and hexagonal cross sections to tensile loading and
   unloading. The thermal conductivity of the nanowires at each deformed
   state is calculated using the Green-Kubo approach with quantum
   correction. The thermal conductivity is found to be dependent on the
   strain induced by tensile loading and unloading. Phase transformations
   are observed in both the loading and unloading processes. Specifically,
   the initially wurtzite-structured (WZ) nanowires transform into a
   tetragonal structure (TS) under tensile loading and revert to the WZ
   structure in the unloading process. In this reverse transformation from
   TS to WZ, transitional states are observed. In the intermediate states,
   the nanowires consist of both TS regions and WZ regions. For particular
   sizes, the nanowires are divided into two WZ domains by an inversion
   domain boundary (IDB). The thermal conductivity in the intermediate
   states is approximately 30\% lower than those in the WZ structure
   because of the lower phonon group velocity in the intermediate states.
   Significant effects of size and crystal structure on mechanical and
   thermal behaviors are also observed. Specifically, as the diameter
   increases from 2.26 to 4.85 nm, the thermal conductivity increases by
   30\%, 10\%, and 50\%, respectively, for the WZ, WZ-TS, and WZ-IDB
   structured wires. However, change in conductivity is negligible for
   TS-structured wires as the diameter changes. The different trends in
   thermal conductivity appear to result from changes in the group velocity
   which is related to the stiffness of the wires and surface scattering of

Title = {{Gene Expression Signatures of Extracellular Matrix and Growth Factors
   during Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cells are uniquely capable of differentiating into
   somatic cell derivatives of all three germ lineages, therefore holding
   tremendous promise for developmental biology studies and regenerative
   medicine therapies. Although temporal patterns of phenotypic gene
   expression have been relatively well characterized during the course of
   differentiation, coincident patterns of endogenous extracellular matrix
   (ECM) and growth factor expression that accompany pluripotent stem cell
   differentiation remain much less well-defined. Thus, the objective of
   this study was to examine the global dynamic profiles of ECM and growth
   factor genes associated with early stages of pluripotent mouse embryonic
   stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Gene expression analysis of ECM and
   growth factors by ESCs differentiating as embryoid bodies for up to 14
   days was assessed using PCR arrays (172 unique genes total), and the
   results were examined using a variety of data mining methods. As
   expected, decreases in the expression of genes regulating pluripotent
   stem cell fate preceded subsequent increases in morphogen expression
   associated with differentiation. Pathway analysis generated solely from
   ECM and growth factor gene expression highlighted morphogenic cell
   processes within the embryoid bodies, such as cell growth, migration,
   and intercellular signaling, that are required for primitive tissue and
   organ developmental events. In addition, systems analysis of ECM and
   growth factor gene expression alone identified intracellular molecules
   and signaling pathways involved in the progression of pluripotent stem
   cell differentiation that were not contained within the array data set.
   Overall, these studies represent a novel framework to dissect the
   complex, dynamic nature of the extracellular biochemical milieu of stem
   cell microenvironments that regulate pluripotent cell fate decisions and
   morphogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{With varying the molecular weight, copolymer chemical structure and
   concentration, the probe diffusion behavior of single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs) in N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solutions of
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   technique. In combination with the systematic viscosity property
   investigation for PAN/DMAc system, the probe diffusion results provided
   insight to understand the interactions between PAN and SWCNTs. It was
   found that, due to depletion interaction, the SWCNT diffusion positively
   deviates from the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation in PAN homopolymer
   solutions. However, in PAN copolymer solution, the SWCNT diffusion
   mostly obeys the SE relation, which was speculated as a result of
   hydrogen-bonding formation between the carboxylic acid functional groups
   in PAN copolymers and on purified SWCNTs. Moreover, due to the unique
   features of SWCNT probes - very long, extremely rigid, and adjustable
   bundle diameter, the SWCNT probe diffusion unambiguously revealed the
   topological constraints of polymer network responsible for the
   retardation of thin rod diffusion. Quantitative analysis indicated that
   the correlation length rather than the ``tube{''} diameter of polymer
   liquid is the critical length scale to dictate the diffusion retardation
   of SWCNTs in polymer solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{5146-5154}},

Abstract = {{In this research, hydroxyapatite nanoparticles sparsely coated with
   tethered poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains were added to a bulk PEO
   matrix of greater molecular weight. The nanoparticles were found to be
   dispersed homogeneously when the particle concentration was high. Two
   different low-aspect ratio shaped particles were used, spherical and
   needle, and had similar dispersion behavior in this matrix.
   Characterization results indicated that the homogeneous dispersion
   achieved here at higher particle loadings was a kinetically trapped
   condition and an interfacial zone had developed at the grafted
   polymer/matrix polymer interface. Additionally at a critical
   nanoparticle loading related to specific values of the nanoparticle
   surface area and interparticle spacing, the crystallite size and amount
   of crystallinity in the PEO matrix began to decrease as opposed to the
   level of nanoparticle dispersion. Overall, these results provide a
   strategy for incorporating relatively high loadings of nanoparticles
   into these matrices without large scale phase segregation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Diffusion of tetrafluoromethane (CF4) in single-walled aluminosilicate
   nanotubes was studied by means of pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR and
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The application of a high magnetic
   field and high magnetic field gradients allowed C-13 PFG NMR
   measurements of diffusion to be performed under conditions of
   sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratios for a broad range of CF4
   loadings. The PFG NMR data were analyzed to obtain the diffusivities for
   diffusion of CF4 inside the nanotube aggregates, in which the sorbate
   displacements exceeded the average length of individual nanotubes. In
   addition, the corresponding diffusivities under conditions of fast
   exchange of CF4 molecules between nanotubes or nanotube aggregates and
   the surrounding gas phase in a nanotube bed were also estimated. The
   experimental CF4 diffusivities inside the nanotube aggregates were found
   to be several times smaller than the corresponding diffusivities
   obtained by MD for diffusion inside the defect-free nanotubes. This
   difference points to the existence of additional transport resistances
   inside the nanotube aggregates under the conditions of the reported PFG
   NMR measurements, i.e., when the gas molecules diffuse through several
   nanotubes interconnected along the nanotube lengths inside the
   aggregates. Such additional transport resistances are likely to
   originate from diffusion through thin layers of microporous material,
   which is expected to connect the individual nanorubes in the aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas adsorption and
   separation has become a significant challenge over the past decade
   because of the large number of new structures reported every year. We
   applied a multiscale computational approach to screen existing MOFs for
   CO2/N-2 separation. Pore characteristics of 1163 MOFs were analyzed by
   the method developed by Haldoupis, Nair, and Sholl (Haldoupis, E.; Nair,
   S.; Sholl, D. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 7528) using a simple
   steric model. On the basis of the pore size analysis, 359 MOFs were
   examined by classical molecular simulations. Adsorption and diffusion
   properties were computed using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. These molecular
   simulations were used to assess which materials hold the greatest
   promise as membrane materials for CO2/N-2 separations. Finally, density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide
   preliminary information on the dynamic framework motion of selected
   MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, limitations in optical lithography have challenged the
   cost-effective manufacture of nano-and microelectronic chips. Spatially
   regular designs have been introduced to improve manufacturability.
   However, regular designed layouts typically require an interference step
   followed by a trim step. These multiple steps increase cost and reduce
   yield. In the present work, Pattern-Integrated Interference Lithography
   (PIIL) is introduced to address this problem. PIIL is the integration of
   interference lithography and superposed pattern mask imaging, combining
   the interference and the trim into a single-exposure step. Example PIIL
   implementations and experimental demonstrations are presented. The
   degrees of freedom associated with the source, pattern mask, and Fourier
   filter designs are described. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Genomic Diversity of Escherichia Isolates from Diverse Habitats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Our understanding of the Escherichia genus is heavily biased toward
   pathogenic or commensal isolates from human or animal hosts. Recent
   studies have recovered Escherichia isolates that persist, and even grow,
   outside these hosts. Although the environmental isolates are typically
   phylogenetically distinct, they are highly related to and phenotypically
   indistinguishable from their human counterparts, including for the
   coliform test. To gain insights into the genomic diversity of
   Escherichia isolates from diverse habitats, including freshwater, soil,
   animal, and human sources, we carried out comparative DNA-DNA
   hybridizations using a multi-genome E. coli DNA microarray. The
   microarray was validated based on hybridizations with selected strains
   whose genome sequences were available and used to assess the frequency
   of microarray false positive and negative signals. Our results showed
   that human fecal isolates share two sets of genes (n>90) that are rarely
   found among environmental isolates, including genes presumably important
   for evading host immune mechanisms (e. g., a multi-drug transporter for
   acids and antimicrobials) and adhering to epithelial cells (e. g.,
   hemolysin E and fimbrial-like adhesin protein). These results imply that
   environmental isolates are characterized by decreased ability to
   colonize host cells relative to human isolates. Our study also provides
   gene markers that can distinguish human isolates from those of
   warm-blooded animal and environmental origins, and thus can be used to
   more reliably assess fecal contamination in natural ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Gas and fine particle (PM2.5) phase formic acid concentrations were
   measured with online instrumentation during separate one- month studies
   in the summer of 2010 in Los Angeles (LA), CA, and Atlanta, GA. In both
   urban environments, median gas phase concentrations were on the order of
   a few ppbv (LA 1.6 ppbv, Atlanta 2.3 ppbv) and median particle phase
   concentrations were approximately tens of ng/m(3) (LA 49 ng/m(3),
   Atlanta 39 ng/m(3)). LA formic acid gas and particle concentrations had
   consistent temporal patterns; both peaked in the early afternoon and
   generally followed the trends in photochemical secondary gases. Atlanta
   diurnal trends were more irregular, but the mean diurnal profile had
   similar afternoon peaks in both gas and particle concentrations,
   suggesting a photochemical source in both cities. LA formic acid
   particle/gas (p/g) ratios ranged between 0.01 and 12\%, with a median of
   1.3\%. No clear evidence that LA formic acid preferentially partitioned
   to particle water was observed, except on three overcast periods of
   suppressed photochemical activity. Application of Henry's Law to predict
   partitioning during these periods greatly under-predicted particle phase
   formate concentrations based on bulk aerosol liquid water content (LWC)
   and pH estimated from thermodynamic models. In contrast to LA, formic
   acid partitioning in Atlanta appeared to be more consistently associated
   with elevated relative humidity (i.e., aerosol LWC), although p/g ratios
   were somewhat lower, ranging from 0.20 to 5.8\%, with a median of 0.8\%.
   Differences in formic acid gas absorbing phase preferences between these
   two cities are consistent with that of bulk water-soluble organic carbon
   reported in a companion paper.}},

   Cancer Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The metastatic potential of cells is an important parameter in the
   design of optimal strategies for the personalized treatment of cancer.
   Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we show, consistent with previous
   studies conducted in other types of epithelial cancer, that ovarian
   cancer cells are generally softer and display lower intrinsic
   variability in cell stiffness than non-malignant ovarian epithelial
   cells. A detailed examination of highly invasive ovarian cancer cells
   (HEY A8) relative to their less invasive parental cells (HEY),
   demonstrates that deformability is also an accurate biomarker of
   metastatic potential. Comparative gene expression analyses indicate that
   the reduced stiffness of highly metastatic HEY A8 cells is associated
   with actin cytoskeleton remodeling and microscopic examination of actin
   fiber structure in these cell lines is consistent with this prediction.
   Our results indicate that cell stiffness may be a useful biomarker to
   evaluate the relative metastatic potential of ovarian and perhaps other
   types of cancer cells.}},

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1537-1544}},

Abstract = {{We tested what to our knowledge is a new computational model for fibrin
   fiber mechanical behavior. The model is composed of three distinct
   elements: the folded fibrinogen core as seen in the crystal structure,
   the unstructured alpha-C connector, and the partially folded alpha-C
   domain. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of all three
   regions and how they may contribute to fibrin fiber stress-strain
   behavior. Yet no molecular model has been computationally tested that
   takes into account the individual contributions of all these regions.
   Constant velocity, steered molecular dynamics studies at 0.025
   angstrom/ps were conducted on the folded fibrinogen core and the alpha-C
   domain to determine their force-displacement behavior. A wormlike chain
   model with a persistence length of 0.8 nm (Kuhn length = 1.6 nm) was
   used to model the mechanical behavior of the unfolded alpha-C connector.
   The three components were combined to calculate the total stress-strain
   response, which was then compared to experimental data. The results show
   that the three-component model successfully captures the experimentally
   determined stress-strain behavior of fibrin fibers. The model evinces
   the key contribution of the alpha-C domains to fibrin fiber
   stress-strain behavior. However, conversion of the alpha-helical coiled
   coils to beta-strands, and partial unfolding of the protein, may also
   contribute.}},

Abstract = {{We observe and systematically tune an intense mid-infrared absorption
   mode that results from phosphorus doping in silicon nanowires
   synthesized via the vapor-liquid-solid technique. The angle- and
   shape-dependence of this spectral feature, as determined via in-situ
   transmission infrared spectroscopy, supports its assignment as a
   longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Modulation of
   resonant frequency (740-1620 cm(-1)) is accomplished by varying nanowire
   length (135-1160 nm). The observed frequency shift is consistent with
   Mie-Gans theory, which indicates electrically active dopant
   concentrations between 10(19) and 10(20) cm(-3). Our findings suggest
   new opportunities to confine light in this ubiquitous semiconductor and
   engineer the optical properties of nontraditional plasmonic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Vast expanses of oxygen-deficient and nitrite-rich water define the
   major oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the global ocean. They support
   diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the
   oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen
   (N-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes,
   including the two pathways of N-2 production, denitrification and
   anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring
   only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual
   method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater,
   however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true
   anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly
   low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these
   OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring
   platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of
   oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic
   metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling
   is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of
   AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the
   presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with
   the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state
   between two ``end points{''} represented by fully oxic systems and fully
   sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are
   chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the
   magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories,
   leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to
   continue well into the future.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless power and data transmission have created promising prospects in
   biomedical research by enabling perpetual data acquisition and
   stimulation systems. We present a work in progress towards such a
   system, called the EnerCage, equipped with scalable arrays of
   overlapping planar spiral coils (PSC) and 3-axis magnetic sensors for
   focused wireless power transmission to randomly moving targets, such as
   small freely behaving animal subjects. The EnerCage system includes a
   stationary unit for 3D non-line-of-sight localization and inductive
   power transmission through a geometrically optimized PSC array. The
   localization algorithm compares the magnetic sensor outputs with a
   threshold to activate a PSC. All PSCs are optimized based on the
   worst-case misalignment, considering parasitics from the overlapping and
   adjacent PSCs. EnerCage also has a mobile unit attached to or implanted
   in the subject's body, which includes a permanent magnetic tracer for
   localization and back telemetry circuit for efficient closed-loop
   inductive power regulation. The EnerCage system is designed to enable
   long-term electrophysiology experiments on freely behaving small animal
   subjects in large experimental arenas without requiring them to carry
   bulky batteries. A prototype of the EnerCage system with five PSCs and
   five magnetic sensors achieved power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 19.6\%
   at the worst-case horizontal misalignment of 49.1 mm (root 1/3 of the
   PSC radius) and coupling distance of 78 mm with a mobile unit coil, 20
   mm in radius. The closed-loop power management mechanism maintains the
   mobile unit received power at 20 mw despite misalignments, tilting, and
   distance variations up to a maximum operating height of 120 mm (PTE =
   5\%).}},

Abstract = {{We designed and fabricated a dynamic receive beamformer integrated
   circuit (IC) in 0.35-mu m CMOS technology. This beamformer IC is
   suitable for integration with an annular array transducer for
   high-frequency (30-50 MHz) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. The
   beamformer IC consists of receive preamplifiers, an analog dynamic
   delay-and-sum beamformer, and buffers for 8 receive channels. To form an
   analog dynamic delay line we designed an analog delay cell based on the
   current-mode first-order all-pass filter topology, as the basic building
   block. To increase the bandwidth of the delay cell, we explored an
   enhancement technique on the current mirrors. This technique improved
   the overall bandwidth of the delay line by a factor of 6. Each delay
   cell consumes 2.1-mW of power and is capable of generating a tunable
   time delay between 1.75 ns to 2.5 ns. We successfully integrated the
   fabricated beamformer IC with an 8-element annular array. Experimental
   test results demonstrated the desired buffering, preamplification and

Abstract = {{Multi-beam interference (MBI) represents a method of producing one-,
   two-, and three-dimensional submicron periodic optical-intensity
   distributions for applications including micro- and nano-electronics,
   photonic crystals, metamaterial, biomedical structures, optical
   trapping, and numerous other subwavelength structures. Accordingly,
   numerous optical configurations have been developed to implement MBI.
   However, these configurations typically provide limited ability to
   condition the key parameters of each interfering beam. Constraints on
   individual beam amplitudes and polarizations are systematically
   considered to understand their effects on lithographically useful MBI
   periodic patterning possibilities. A method for analyzing parametric
   constraints is presented and used to compare the optimized
   optical-intensity distributions for representative constrained systems.
   Case studies are presented for both square and hexagonal-lattices
   produced via three-beam interference. Results demonstrate that
   constraints on individual-beam polarizations significantly impact
   patterning possibilities and must be included in the systematic design
   of an MBI system. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we study the problem of designing SVM classifiers when the
   kernel matrix, K, is affected by uncertainty. Specifically K is modeled
   as a positive affine combination of given positive semi definite
   kernels, with the coefficients ranging in a norm-bounded uncertainty
   set. We treat the problem using the Robust Optimization methodology.
   This reduces the uncertain SVM problem into a deterministic conic
   quadratic problem which can be solved in principle by a polynomial time
   Interior Point (IP) algorithm. However, for large-scale classification
   problems, IP methods become intractable and one has to resort to
   first-order gradient type methods. The strategy we use here is to
   reformulate the robust counterpart of the uncertain SVM problem as a
   saddle point problem and employ a special gradient scheme which works
   directly on the convex-concave saddle function. The algorithm is a
   simplified version of a general scheme due to Juditski and Nemirovski
   (2011). It achieves an O(1/T-2) reduction of the initial error after T
   iterations. A comprehensive empirical study on both synthetic data and
   real-world protein structure data sets show that the proposed
   formulations achieve the desired robustness, and the saddle point based
   algorithm outperforms the IP method significantly.}},

Title = {{Effect of Substrate Flexibility on the Pressure Distribution and Lifting
   Force Generated by a Bernoulli Gripper}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling and analysis of the pressure
   distribution and lifting force generated by a Bernoulli gripper when
   handling flexible substrates such as thin silicon wafers. A Bernoulli
   gripper is essentially a radial airflow nozzle used to handle large and
   small, rigid and nonrigid materials by creating a low pressure region or
   vacuum between the gripper and material. Previous studies on Bernoulli
   gripping have analyzed the pressure distribution and lifting force for
   handling thick substrates that undergo negligible deformation. Since the
   lifting force produced by the gripper is a function of the gap between
   the handled object and the gripper, any deformation of the substrate
   will influence the gap and consequently the pressure distribution and
   lifting force. In this paper, the effect of substrate (thin silicon
   wafer) flexibility on the equilibrium wafer deformation, radial pressure
   distribution and lifting force is modeled and analyzed using a
   combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and finite
   element analysis. The equilibrium wafer deformation for different air
   flow rates is compared with experimental data and is shown to be in good
   agreement. In addition, the effect of wafer deformation on the pressure
   and lifting force are shown to be significant at higher volumetric
   airflow rates. The modeling and analysis approach presented in this
   paper is particularly useful for evaluating the effect of gripper
   variables on the handling stresses generated in thin silicon wafers and
   for gripper design optimization. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007186]}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes a CMOS 65 nm 24 GHz wide-band frequency synthesizer
   with programmability on acquisition speed and supply voltage for low
   power application in 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmW) wireless transceiver.
   The role of mmW phase-locked loop (PLL) is significant for supporting 7
   GHz bandwidth across the four channels in IEEE 802.15.3c. The PLL is
   introduced with consideration of system specifications, as well as the
   design of individual block. In order to maintain the dynamic behavior of
   a PLL, two control parameters of its loop transfer function are used for
   programmability, including the charge pump current and pole-zero
   position. A regulator is also adopted for supply noise suppression. The
   Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) covers frequency range from 24.2 to
   29.3 GHz, with 19.1\% tuning range. On top of the oscillator, a 1.2V LDO
   (Low-Dropout Regulator) with 0.2V dropout voltage is introduced to
   increase the immunity against low frequency noise uctuation from supply.
   With the proposed structure, the PLL provides a loop bandwidth from 0.94
   to 2.05 MHz. The phase margin is larger than 54 degrees and the locking
   time can be adjusted 16\% faster than nominal case. The VCO has better
   power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of -48 dB, and Phase Noise of -94
   dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset of 24 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{The thermo-order-mechanical behaviors of liquid crystal elastomers
   (LCEs) under biaxial loading are studied in this paper. Inverse method
   for nonlinear elastic problems is utilized by imposing biaxial
   stretching to thin rectangular samples. Neo-classical elastic energy is
   used together with the Landau-de Gennes nematic free energy. Under plane
   stress assumptions, the constitutive equations are derived. Due to the
   possible reorientations of the liquid crystal molecules induced by the
   imposed biaxial loading, the in-plane nonlinear stress-strain relations
   can have different expressions depending on which loading axis will have
   the largest effective principal strain. And the free energy is a
   multi-well non-convex potential function. As shown by some typical
   loading paths, the LCE samples will exhibit an anisotropic nonlinear
   elastic behavior, as long as the loading has not induced a reorientation
   of the liquid crystal molecules. When this did occur, jumps of stresses
   could take place for dead loadings due to the losing of stability.}},

Abstract = {{The current procedures in post-earthquake safety and structural
   assessment are performed manually by a skilled triage team of structural
   engineers/certified inspectors. These procedures, and particularly the
   physical measurement of the damage properties, are time-consuming and
   qualitative in nature. This paper proposes a novel method that
   automatically detects spalled regions on the surface of reinforced
   concrete columns and measures their properties in image data. Spalling
   has been accepted as an important indicator of significant damage to
   structural elements during an earthquake. According to this method, the
   region of spalling is first isolated by way of a local entropy-based
   thresholding algorithm. Following this, the exposure of longitudinal
   reinforcement (depth of spalling into the column) and length of spalling
   along the column are measured using a novel global adaptive thresholding
   algorithm in conjunction with image processing methods in template
   matching and morphological operations. The method was tested on a
   database of damaged RC column images collected after the 2010 Haiti
   earthquake, and comparison of the results with manual measurements
   indicate the validity of the method. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Coral reefs are in global decline, with seaweeds increasing as corals
   decrease. Although seaweeds inhibit coral growth, recruitment, and
   survivorship, the mechanism of these interactions is poorly understood.
   Here, we used field experiments to show that contact with four common
   seaweeds induces bleaching on natural colonies of Porites rus. Controls
   in contact with inert, plastic mimics of seaweeds did not bleach,
   suggesting seaweed effects resulted from allelopathy rather than
   shading, abrasion, or physical contact. Bioassay-guided fractionation of
   the hydrophobic extract from the red alga Phacelocarpus neurymenioides
   revealed a previously characterized antibacterial metabolite,
   neurymenolide A, as the main allelopathic agent. For allelopathy of
   lipid-soluble metabolites to be effective, the compounds would need to
   be deployed on algal surfaces where they could transfer to corals on
   contact. We used desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
   (DESI-MS) to visualize and quantify neurymenolide A on the surface of P.
   neurymenioides, and we found the molecule on all surfaces analyzed, with

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{630-656}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Capstone design courses seek to prepare engineering students for
   industry by challenging student teams to solve real-world problems. To
   improve this preparation, university programs have recently focused on
   creating multidisciplinary teams. However, there is limited quantitative
   evidence showing that multidisciplinary student engineering teams
   develop higher quality projects or are better prepared for the work
   force.
   HYPOTHESIS
   Students who take a multidisciplinary capstone design (MCD) course have
   better outcomes than monodisciplinary capstone students as measured by
   job placement and/or independent evaluation by industrial professionals
   of students' products.
   METHODOLOGY
   A single treatment was administered to Georgia Tech capstone design
   students for one semester with three course conditions: (1)
   monodisciplinary biomedical, (2) monodisciplinary mechanical, or (3)
   multidisciplinary biomedical and mechanical engineering. After course
   completion, students' cumulative GPA, job placement, and design
   exposition score were obtained and analyzed. This analysis used a
   generalized linear model for the exposition score and a logistic model
   for job placement outcomes.
   RESULTS
   A general linear model showed that all students who took the MCD course,
   regardless of major, produced an engineering solution that was better
   than that of their monodisciplinary contemporaries as measured by
   external industry professionals. Logistic and multinomial regressions
   showed that the MCD course increased the odds of employment
   significantly for biomedical engineering students.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In this preliminary investigation, the MCD teams' holistic performance
   in innovation, utility, analysis, proof of concept, and communication
   skills was superior to that of their monodisciplinary counterparts, and,
   on average, they were hired more frequently.}},

   including the choice of materials for TPoS filters. We demonstrate a
   design for an air-suspended AlN-on-Si filter, which offers a low
   insertion loss of 2.4 dB at 2.877 GHz. The bandwidth of this filter is
   12 MHz with a return loss of better than 30 dB. In Part II of this

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the atomistic
   mechanisms governing the pseudoelasticity and shape memory in
   nickel-titanium (NiTi) nanostructures. For a < 1 1 0 > - oriented
   nanopillar subjected to compressive loading unloading, we observe either
   a pseudoelastic or shape memory response, depending on the applied
   strain and temperature that control the reversibility of phase
   transformation and deformation twinning. We show that irreversible
   twinning arises owing to the dislocation pinning of twin boundaries,
   while hierarchically twinned microstructures facilitate the reversible
   twinning. The nanoscale size effects are manifested as the load
   serration, stress plateau and large hysteresis loop in stress strain
   curves that result from the high stresses required to drive the
   nucleation-controlled phase transformation and deformation twinning in
   nanosized volumes. Our results underscore the importance of
   atomistically resolved modeling for understanding the phase and
   deformation reversibilities that dictate the pseudoelasticity and shape
   memory behavior in nanostructured shape memory alloys. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{The impact of the two adaptation-induced mutations in an improved

   chromosomal mutation at the xylose reductase gene was critical to xylose
   metabolism by reducing xylitol formation. Together with the
   plasmid-borne mutation impacting xylose isomerase activity, these two
   mutations accounted for 80 \% of the improvement achieved by adaptation.
   To generate a strain fermenting xylose in the presence of high acetic
   acid concentrations, we transferred the two mutations to an acetic
   acid-tolerant strain. The resulting strain fermented glucose + xylose
   (each at 5 \% w/v) with 1 \% (w/v) acetic acid at pH 5.8 to completion
   with an ethanol yield of 93.4 \%, outperforming other reported strains.

Abstract = {{Graphite electrodes are embedded within the discharge channel of a Hall
   effect thruster to focus ions for improved performance. Cusp-shaped
   magnetic fields are added around the electrodes to shield the electrodes
   from high electron current. Internal plasma potential measurements
   inside the discharge channel show that the presence of floating graphite
   does not significantly affect the potential contours at 150 V anode
   potential. Creation of closed contour pockets are observed with the
   electrodes biased 10 and 30 V above the anode potential. The electrodes
   also cause a compression of the acceleration region in the thruster. The
   cause of the changes in the potential contours is attributed to a
   shifting of discharge electrode from the anode to the electrodes and an
   expansion of the near-wall plasma sheath. The presence of the cusp
   magnetic fields is shown to affect the current collected by the
   electrodes, a behavior associated with modification of the plasma sheath
   properties due to magnetization of electrons. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Establishing process-structure-property relationships is an important
   objective in the paradigm of materials design in order to reduce the
   time and cost needed to develop new materials. A method to link
   phase-field (process-structure relations) and microstructure-sensitive

   for subsolvus polycrystalline IN100. A three-dimensional experimental
   dataset obtained by orientation imaging microscopy performed on serial
   sections is utilized to calibrate a phase-field model and to calculate
   inputs for a finite-element analysis. Simulated annealing of the dataset
   realized through phase-field modeling results in a range of coarsened
   microstructures with varying grain size distributions that are each
   input into the finite-element model. A rate-dependent crystal plasticity
   constitutive model that captures the first-order effects of grain size,
   precipitate size and precipitate volume fraction on the mechanical
   response of IN 100 at 650 C is used to simulate stress-strain behavior
   of the coarsened polycrystals. Model limitations and ideas for future

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel discrete chaotic map named zigzag
   map that demonstrates excellent chaotic behaviors and can be utilized in
   truly random number generators (TRNGs). We comprehensively investigate
   the map and explore its critical chaotic characteristics and parameters.
   We further present two circuit implementations for the zigzag map based
   on the switched current technique as well as the current-mode affine
   interpolation of the breakpoints. In practice, implementation variations
   can deteriorate the quality of the output sequence as a result of
   variation of the chaotic map parameters. In order to quantify the impact
   of variations on the map performance, we model the variations using a
   combination of theoretical analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations on the
   circuits. We demonstrate that even in the presence of the map
   variations, a TRNG based on the zigzag map passes all of the NIST 800-22
   statistical randomness tests using simple post processing of the output
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Several error control schemes have been introduced for Underwater
   Wireless Sensor Networks (LIWSNs) to combat the effects of high error
   rates. However, these schemes have only been evaluated based on
   point-to-point communication metrics and do not consider the different
   underwater propagation phenomena. On the other hand, the unique
   properties of UWSNs such as the three-dimensional architecture and the
   underwater channel characteristics prevent existing studies of error
   control schemes for terrestrial sensor networks to be applied to this
   domain.
   In this paper, a cross-layer analysis framework is developed to evaluate
   existing error control techniques in three-dimensional multi-hop UWSNs.
   The developed framework captures the effects of automatic repeat request
   (ARQ), forward error correction (FEC), and hybrid ARQ schemes on
   end-to-end energy, latency, and packet error rate. In addition,
   different underwater propagation phenomena are considered with a
   particular attention on the presence of shadow zones. The theoretical
   analysis and the numerical evaluations reveal that exploiting FEC
   schemes with channel-aware routing reduces the end-to-end energy
   consumption and latency under all propagation phenomena for all water
   depths in UWSNs. The selection of the suitable error control scheme
   depends also on the water depth (shallow/deep water) and on the
   different underwater propagation phenomena. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A geometric modeling scheme called periodic surface model (PS) is used
   to construct three dimensional (3D) models of a gas diffusion layer's
   (GDL) microstructure, which allows for rapid model construction and
   modification of representative volume elements (RVE) with embedded
   periodic boundary conditions. The reconstructed PS models are optimized
   with the help of the genetic algorithm embedded in MATLAB to generate
   models with refined mesh for computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   analysis. The GDL geometry is built in ANSYS/ICEM CFD, automatically,
   using a customized code that couples MATLAB and ICEM. To verify the
   validity of the suggested modeling approach the microstructures of the
   GDLs with different porosity and fiber orientation are generated and the
   in-plane and through-plane permeability and tortuosity are calculated
   using ANSYS/FLUENT software. The numerically predicted values of
   in-plane and through-plane permeability are compared to experimental
   measurements. Using the genetic algorithm significantly decreases the
   fibers intersection volume in the RVE, especially as porosity decreases.
   It has been found that the tortuosity of the GDL is a function of the
   spatial orientation of the fibers in the RVE, when the fibers are at a
   small angle, the in-plane tortuosity can be higher than the
   through-plane tortuosity. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Relationship between x-ray illumination field size and flat field
   intensity and its impacts on x-ray imaging}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{5901-5909}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: X-ray cone-beam CT (CBCT) is being increasingly used for
   various clinical applications, while its performance is still hindered
   by image artifacts. This work investigates a new source of
   reconstruction error, which is often overlooked in the current CBCT
   imaging. The authors find that the x-ray flat field intensity (I-0)
   varies significantly as the illumination volume size changes at
   different collimator settings. A wrong I-0 value leads to inaccurate CT
   numbers of reconstructed images as well as wrong scatter measurements in
   the CBCT research.
   Methods: The authors argue that the finite size of x-ray focal spot
   together with the detector glare effect cause the I-0 variation at
   different illumination sizes. Although the focal spot of commercial
   x-ray tubes typically has a nominal size of less than 1 mm, the
   off-focal-spot radiation covers an area of several millimeters on the
   tungsten target. Due to the large magnification factor from the field
   collimator to the detector, the penumbra effects of the collimator
   blades result in different I-0 values for different illumination field
   sizes. Detector glare further increases the variation, since one pencil
   beam of incident x-ray is scattered into an area of several centimeters
   on the detector. In this paper, the authors study these two effects by
   measuring the focal spot distribution with a pinhole assembly and the
   detector point spread function (PSF) with an edge-spread function
   method. The authors then derive a formula to estimate the I-0 value for
   different illumination field sizes, using the measured focal spot
   distribution and the detector PSF. Phantom studies are carried out to
   investigate the accuracy of scatter measurements and CT images with and
   without considering the I-0 variation effects.
   Results: On our tabletop system with a Varian Paxscan 4030CB flat-panel
   detector and a Varian RAD-94 x-ray tube as used on a clinical CBCT
   system, the focal spot distribution has a measured
   full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of around 0.4 mm, while non-negligible
   off-focal-spot radiation is observed at a distance of over 2 mm from the
   center. The measured detector PSF has an FWHM of 0.510 mm, with a shape
   close to Gaussian. From these two distributions, the author calculate
   the estimated to values at different collimator settings. The I-0
   variation mainly comes from the focal spot effect. The estimation
   matches well with the measurements at different collimator widths in
   both horizontal and vertical directions, with an average error of less
   than 3\%. Our method improves the accuracy of conventional scatter
   measurements, where the scatter is measured as the difference between
   fan-beam and cone-beam projections. On a uniform water cylinder phantom,
   more accurate I-0 suppresses the unfaithful high-frequency signals at
   the object boundaries of the measured scatter, and the SPR estimation
   error is reduced from 0.158 to 0.014. The proposed I-0 estimation also
   reduces the reconstruction error from about 20 HU on the Catphan(C)600
   phantom in the selected regions of interest to less than 4 HU.
   Conclusions: The I-0 variation is identified as one additional error
   source in x-ray imaging. By measuring the focal-spot distribution and
   detector PSF, the authors propose an accurate method of estimating the
   I-0 value for different illumination field sizes. The method obtains
   more accurate scatter measurements and therefore facilitates scatter
   correction algorithm designs. As correction methods for other CBCT
   artifacts become more successful, our research is significant in further
   improving the CBCT imaging accuracy. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and test an automated algorithm to classify the
   different tissues present in dedicated breast CT images.
   Methods: The original CT images are first corrected to overcome cupping
   artifacts, and then a multiscale bilateral filter is used to reduce
   noise while keeping edge information on the images. As skin and
   glandular tissues have similar CT values on breast CT images,
   morphologic processing is used to identify the skin mask based on its
   position information. A modified fuzzy C-means (FCM) classification
   method is then used to classify breast tissue as fat and glandular
   tissue. By combining the results of the skin mask with the FCM, the
   breast tissue is classified as skin, fat, and glandular tissue. To
   evaluate the authors' classification method, the authors use Dice
   overlap ratios to compare the results of the automated classification to
   those obtained by manual segmentation on eight patient images.
   Results: The correction method was able to correct the cupping artifacts
   and improve the quality of the breast CT images. For glandular tissue,
   the overlap ratios between the authors' automatic classification and
   manual segmentation were 91.6\% +/- 2.0\%.
   Conclusions: A cupping artifact correction method and an automatic
   classification method were applied and evaluated for high-resolution

   quantitative measurements regarding breast composition, density, and

Abstract = {{Purpose: Combined MR/PET is a relatively new, hybrid imaging modality. A
   human MR/PET prototype system consisting of a Siemens 3T Trio MR and
   brain PET insert was installed and tested at our institution. Its
   present design does not offer measured attenuation correction (AC) using
   traditional transmission imaging. This study is the development of
   quantification tools including MR-based AC for quantification in
   combined MR/PET for brain imaging.
   Methods: The developed quantification tools include image registration,
   segmentation, classification, and MR-based AC. These components were
   integrated into a single scheme for processing MR/PET data. The
   segmentation method is multiscale and based on the Radon transform of
   brain MR images. It was developed to segment the skull on T1-weighted MR
   images. A modified fuzzy C-means classification scheme was developed to
   classify brain tissue into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal
   fluid. Classified tissue is assigned an attenuation coefficient so that
   AC factors can be generated. PET emission data are then reconstructed
   using a three-dimensional ordered sets expectation maximization method
   with the MR-based AC map. Ten subjects had separate MR and PET scans.
   The PET with {[}C-11]PIB was acquired using a high-resolution research
   tomography (HRRT) PET. MR-based AC was compared with transmission
   (TX)-based AC on the HRRT. Seventeen volumes of interest were drawn
   manually on each subject image to compare the PET activities between the
   MR-based and TX-based AC methods.
   Results: For skull segmentation, the overlap ratio between our segmented
   results and the ground truth is 85.2 +/- 2.6\%. Attenuation correction
   results from the ten subjects show that the difference between the MR
   and TX-based methods was <6.5\%.
   Conclusions: MR-based AC compared favorably with conventional
   transmission-based AC. Quantitative tools including registration,
   segmentation, classification, and MR-based AC have been developed for
   use in combined MR/PET. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Sustainable development of nanotechnology requires an understanding of
   the long term ecotoxicological impact of engineered nanomaterials on the
   environment. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2-NPs) have great potential
   to accumulate and adversely affect the environment owing to their
   widespread applications in commercial products. This study documented
   the chronic phenotypic response of tomato plants to CeO2-NPs (0.1-10 mg
   L-1) and determined the effect of CeO2-NPs on tomato yield. The results
   indicated that CeO2-NPs at the concentrations applied in this study had
   either an inconsequential or a slightly positive effect on plant growth
   and tomato production. However, elevated cerium content was detected in
   plant tissues exposed to CeO2-NPs, suggesting that CeO2-NPs were taken
   up by tomato roots and translocated to shoots and edible tissues. In
   particular, substantially higher Ce concentrations were detected in the
   fruits exposed to 10 mg L-1 CeO2-NPs, compared with controls. This study
   sheds light on the long term impact of CeO2-NPs on plant health and its
   implications for our food safety and security.}},

Abstract = {{The scattering of terahertz radiation on a graphene-based nano-patch
   antenna is numerically analyzed. The extinction cross section of the
   nano-antenna supported by silicon and silicon dioxide substrates of
   different thickness are calculated. Scattering resonances in the
   terahertz band are identified as Fabry Perot resonances of surface
   plasmon polaritons supported by the graphene film. A strong tunability
   of the antenna resonances via electrostatic bias is numerically
   demonstrated, opening perspectives to design tunable graphene-based
   nano-antennas. These antennas are envisaged to enable wireless

Abstract = {{Nanomedicine is an emerging field that integrates nanotechnology,
   biomolecular engineering, life sciences and medicine; it is expected to
   produce major breakthroughs in medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Due
   to the size-compatibility of nano-scale structures and devices with
   proteins and nucleic acids, the design, synthesis and application of
   nanoprobes, nanocarriers and nanomachines provide unprecedented
   opportunities for achieving a better control of biological processes,
   and drastic improvements in disease detection, therapy, and prevention.
   Recent advances in nanomedicine include the development of functional
   nanoparticle based molecular imaging probes, nano-structured materials
   as drug/gene carriers for in vivo delivery, and engineered molecular
   machines for treating single-gene disorders. This review focuses on the
   development of molecular imaging probes and engineered nucleases for
   nanomedicine, including quantum dot bioconjugates, quantum
   dot-fluorescent protein FRET probes, molecular beacons, magnetic and
   gold nanoparticle based imaging contrast agents, and the design and
   validation of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases
   (TALENs) for gene targeting. The challenges in translating nanomedicine

Abstract = {{Core-shell nanowires (NWs) composed of silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge)
   are key structures for realizing high mobility transistor channels,
   since the site-selective doping and band-offset in core-shell NWs
   separate the carrier transport region from the impurity doped region,
   resulting in the suppression of impurity scattering. Four different
   types of Si/Ge (i-Si/n-Ge, p-Si/i-Ge) and Ge/Si (n-Ge/i-Si, i-Ge/p-Si)
   core-shell NWs structures were rationally grown. The surface morphology
   significantly depended on the types of the core-shell NWs. Raman and
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements clearly characterized the
   compressive and tensile stress in the core and shell regions. The
   observation of boron (B) and phosphorus (P) local vibrational peaks and
   the Fano effect clearly demonstrated that the B and P atoms are
   selectively doped into the shell and core regions and electrically
   activated in the substitutional sites, showing the success of
   site-selective doping.}},

Abstract = {{The piezo-phototronic effect is about the use of the piezoelectric
   potential created inside some materials for enhancing the charge carrier
   generation or separation at the metal-semiconductor contact or pn
   junction. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of the
   piezo-phototronic effect on the photon sensitivity for a ZnO-CdS
   core-shell micro/nanowire based visible and UV sensor. CdS nanowire
   arrays were grown on the surface of a ZnO micro/nanowire to form a
   ZnO-CdS core-shell nanostructure by a facile hydrothermal method. With
   the two ends of a ZnO-CdS wire bonded on a polymer substrate, a flexible
   photodetector was fabricated, which is sensitive simultaneously to both
   green light (548 nm) and UV light (372 nm). Furthermore, the performance
   of the photon sensor is much enhanced by the strain-induced
   piezopotential in the ZnO core through modulation of the Schottky
   barrier heights at the source and drain contacts. This work demonstrates
   a new application of the piezotronic effect in photon detectors.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00217.2012.-Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a
   major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States today. We
   employed a model for AAA development using apolipoprotein E knock out
   mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with ANG II and
   beta-aminopropionitrile (beta-APN) for 4 wk. ANG II induces hypertension
   and atherosclerotic disease, whereas beta-APN inhibits the activity of
   the lysyl oxidase/lysyl oxidase-like protein (LOX/LOXL) family members.
   LOX/LOXL family members cross-link collagen and elastin in the
   extracellular matrix and therefore contribute to the integrity and
   stabilization of a healthy vessel wall. In this model, cotreatment with
   ANG II and beta-APN caused a 90\% AAA incidence and increased
   atherosclerotic lesion formation from less than 5\% to greater than 25\%
   after 4 wk. In more atheroprotected mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BalbC),
   cotreatment with ANG II and beta-APN caused 50\% and 40\% AAA incidence,
   respectively. These data demonstrate the importance of LOX/LOXL to the
   stability of the vessel wall. Therapeutic strategies to overexpress
   LOX/LOXL enzymes or to support the crosslinking of soluble matrix
   proteins in a polymeric scaffold are a promising opportunity to achieve
   stabilization of AAAs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, power allocation between pilots and data symbols is
   investigated to maximize energy efficiency (EE) for downlink orthogonal
   frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks. We first derive an
   EE function considering channel estimation error, which depends on
   large-scale channel gains of multiple users, allocated power to pilots
   and data symbols, and circuit power consumption. Then an optimization
   problem is formulated to maximize the EE under overall transmit power
   constraint. Exploiting the quasiconcavity property of the EE function,
   we propose an alternating optimization method in the low transmit power
   region and reformulate a joint quasiconcave problem in the high transmit
   power region. Analysis and simulation results show that the power ratio
   for pilots decreases with the circuit power. When the circuit power is
   small, the optimal overall transmit power increases with the circuit
   power. Otherwise, the optimal transmit power does not depend on it.
   Transmitting more data symbols to the users with higher channel gains
   improves the EE but at a cost of sacrificing the fairness among multiple
   users. Simulation results also demonstrate that compared with spectral
   efficiency (SE)-oriented design, the EE-oriented design can improve the
   EE performance significantly with a relatively small SE loss.}},

Abstract = {{We describe thermally moderated multi-layered pseudo-monolithic hollow
   fiber sorbents entities, which can be packed into compact modules to
   provide small-footprint, efficient H-2 purification/CO2 removal systems
   for use in on-site steam methane reformer product gas separations.
   Dual-layer hollow fibers are created via dry-jet, wet-quench spinning
   with an inner ``active{''} core of cellulose acetate (porous binder) and
   zeolite NaY (69 wt\% zeolite NaY) and an external sheath layer of pure
   cellulose acetate. The co-spun sheath layer reduces the surface porosity
   of the fiber and was used as a smooth coating surface for a
   poly(vinyl-alcohol) post-treatment, which reduced the gas permeance
   through the fiber sorbent by at least 7 orders of magnitude, essentially
   creating an impermeable sheath layer. The interstitial volume between
   the individual fibers was filled with a thermally-moderating paraffin
   wax. CO2 breakthrough experiments on the hollow fiber sorbent modules
   with and without paraffin wax revealed that the ``passively{''} cooled
   paraffin wax module had 12.5\% longer breakthrough times than the
   ``non-isothermal{''} module. The latent heat of fusion/melting of the
   wax offsets the released latent heat of sorption/desorption of the
   zeolites. One-hundred rapidly cycled pressure swing adsorption cycles
   were performed on the ``passively{''} cooled hollow fiber sorbents using
   25 vol\% CO2/75 vol\% He (H-2 surrogate) at 60 degrees C and 113 psia,
   resulting in a product purity of 99.2\% and a product recovery of 88.1\%
   thus achieving process conditions and product quality comparable to
   conventional pellet processes. Isothermal and non-isothermal dynamic
   modeling of the hollow fiber sorbent module and a traditional packed bed
   using gPROMS (R) indicated that the fiber sorbents have sharper fronts
   (232\% sharper) and longer adsorbate breakthrough times (66\% longer),
   further confirming the applicability of the new fiber sorbent approach
   for H-2 purification. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{While recent reports have established significant miscibility in
   polymer:fullerene blends used in organic solar cells, little is actually
   known about why polymers and fullerenes mix and how their mixing can be
   controlled. Here, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), and molecular simulations are used to study mixing in
   a variety of polymer:molecule blends by systematically varying the
   polymer and small-molecule properties. It is found that a variety of
   polymer:fullerene blends mix by forming bimolecular crystals provided
   there is sufficient space between the polymer side chains to accommodate
   a fullerene. Polymer:tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ)
   bimolecular crystals were also observed, although bimolecular crystals
   did not form in the other studied polymer:non-fullerene blends,
   including those with both conjugated and non-conjugated small molecules.
   DSC and molecular simulations demonstrate that strong polymerfullerene
   interactions can exist, and the calculations point to van der Waals
   interactions as a significant driving force for molecular mixing.}},

Abstract = {{Assistive technologies (ATs) can enable individuals with severe
   disabilities to communicate their intentions to other devices or
   individuals, particularly allowing them to control their environments
   via computers. In this article, we have introduced the basic concept and
   development of a new wireless tongue-operated AT, called Tongue Drive
   System (TDS), that can wirelessly detect users' tongue movements using
   an array of magnetic sensors and a small magnetic tracer secured on the
   tongue, and translate them into a set of user-defined commands in real
   time, which can then be used to communicate with target devices in the
   users' environments. Our goal is to provide users with an unobtrusive,
   minimally invasive, low-power, high-bandwidth, wireless, wearable,
   easy-to-use, and aesthetically appealing solution that is superior to
   other existing ATs for people with the most severe physical
   disabilities. The performance of the latest TDS prototype has been
   evaluated by both able-bodied subjects and patients with high-level
   spinal cord injuries. Results have demonstrated that the TDS can indeed
   offer its users much higher communication bandwidth compared to

Abstract = {{A phase-coherent negative-resistance upconverting parametric amplifier
   is presented that upconverts to three times the source input frequency
   and exhibits over 600 MHz, or 33\%, fractional usable bandwidth at the
   upconverted output. An analytical model for the transducer gain is
   presented, enabling an initial selection of the termination resistors
   and pump signal. A prototype board was constructed and measured data
   matches well with both simulated results and those predicted by the
   analytical model. Simulations, measurements, and the analytic derivation
   demonstrate that when the source and pump frequencies are phase
   coherent, it is possible to achieve a transducer gain greater than the
   theoretical limit imposed by the Manley-Rowe relations for
   phase-incoherent upconverters.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays with enhanced performance and reduced profile, electronics and
   photonics devices demand efficient heat dissipation and low operation
   temperature. Thereby, instead of traditional fillers (e. g., fused
   silica), thermally conductive silicon carbide (SiC) particles and
   multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are applied here as fillers in
   composites for underfill and thermal interfacial materials (TIMs),
   respectively. SiC particles are coated with an ultrathin layer of
   silicon oxide by thermal oxidation at 800 degrees C in air and
   consequently functionalized by gamma-glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane in
   order to graft epoxides on their surface. Moreover, MWNTs were
   chemically functionalized with carboxyls and hydroxyls in a concentrated
   acid mixture. Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform
   infrared spectrascopy, and thermogravimetric analysis characterization
   indicates that both of the fillers are successfully functionalized,
   which makes their surface reactive with epoxy resin, resulting in
   interfacial covalent chemical bonding between the thermally conductive
   fillers and epoxy resin. It is found that interfacial chemical bonding
   across the interface between these functionalized fillers and polymer
   matrix can promote significant thermal conductivity enhancement of epoxy
   composites, which is promising for underfill and TIMs in Cu/low-K
   application.}},

   a 7 V actuation voltage are used to switch between different phase
   delays. The phase shifter exhibits a loss of 0.75 dB/bit with 2.25

Abstract = {{A wideband common-gate (CG) low-noise amplifier (LNA) utilizing
   positive-negative-feedback technique is presented. The
   positive-negative-feedback technique boosts effective transconductance
   (G(m)) and output impedance, which leads to an LNA with higher gain and
   lower noise figure (NF) over the previously reported amplifiers. In
   addition, this approach provides high linearity with an aid of third
   harmonic cancellation, and it breaks transconductance (g(m))
   constriction for input matching in CG amplifiers. In this paper,
   linearity and output impedance improvement through the proposed
   technique are fully analyzed. An LNA prototype is implemented in 0.18-mu
   m CMOS technology occupying a total area of 0.33 mm(2). The implemented
   LNA delivers a maximum voltage gain of 21 dB, a minimum NF of 2 dB, an
   third-order intermodulation intercept point of -3.2 dBm, and 3.6 mW of
   power consumption in 300-920 MHz of 3-dB bandwidth with input matching

Abstract = {{Energy is required to sustain life. A human-centered analysis of the
   worldwide energy situation is conducted in terms of quality of
   life-related variables that are affected, but not directly determined,
   by energy consumption. Data since 1980 show a continuous global increase
   in both energy consumption and quality of life, and lower population
   growth in countries with higher quality of life. Based on these trends,
   we advance non-linear energy consumption predictions and identify
   various plausible scenarios to optimally steer future energy demands, in
   order to maximize quality of life. The scenarios consider the coupling
   between energy consumption rate per capita, quality of life, population
   growth, social inequality, and governments' energy-for-life efficiency.
   The results show the energy cost of increasing quality of life in the
   developing world, energy savings that can be realized by limiting
   overconsumption without impacting quality of life, and the role of
   governments on increasing energy-for-life efficiency and reducing social
   inequality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is investigated to
   decompose the impact echo (IE) testing data into different spectral
   composition for defect signal extraction. The effects of critical EEMD
   parameters are studied. As IE signals have strong surface waves with
   wide bandwidth, the amplitude of the added white noise is larger than
   that normally used for other applications to successfully decompose all
   interested modes. The number of ensemble trials increases with
   increasing noise amplitude. The influence of the frequency of the signal
   to be extracted on the EEMD performance is also analyzed. The results
   show that the high frequency resonance mode is easier to be extracted
   than the low frequency resonance mode from the IE signal. The
   effectiveness of the EEMD method for IE signal decomposition is
   demonstrated using both numerical simulations and experimental tests.

Title = {{Load-differential imaging for detection and localization of fatigue
   cracks using Lamb waves}},
Journal = {{NDT \& E INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{142-149}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fatigue cracks are common and potentially critical defects in metallic
   plate-like structures, and ultrasonic guided wave methods provide an
   efficient and relatively low-cost means of crack detection and
   monitoring. However, widely used baseline subtraction methods may fail
   under mismatched environmental and operational conditions. In
   particular, varying applied loads change not only the contact state of a
   crack but also specimen dimensions and wave speeds, which affect the
   ultrasonic signal response. The load dependence of crack opening
   provides a possibility for enhanced crack detection, which is well-known
   for higher frequency bulk waves. A load-differential method is proposed
   in this paper whereby guided wave signals obtained at different loads
   under the same damage state are compared without utilizing previously
   recorded damage-free data. To demonstrate this method, a fatigue test
   was performed on an aluminum plate specimen instrumented with a sparse
   array of piezoelectric transducers. Signal changes due to crack opening
   effects caused by increasing tensile loads are visualized using
   delay-and-sum imaging. The results show that the load-differential
   method is capable of detecting cracks and visualizing their locations.

Abstract = {{The immunological outcome of dendritic cell (DC) treatment with
   different biomaterials was assessed to demonstrate the range of DC
   phenotypes induced by biomaterials commonly used in combination
   products. Immature DCs (iDCs) were derived from human peripheral blood
   monocytes, and treated with different biomaterial films of alginate,
   agarose, chitosan, hyaluronic acid (HA), or 75:25
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and a comprehensive battery of
   phenotypic functional outcomes was assessed. Different levels of
   functional changes in DC phenotype were observed depending on the type
   of biomaterial films used to treat the DCs. Treatment of DCs with PLGA
   or chitosan films supported DC maturation, with higher levels of DC
   allostimulatory capacity, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and
   expression of CD80, CD86, CD83, HLA-DQ and CD44 compared with iDCs, and
   lower endocytic ability compared with iDCs. Alginate film induced
   pro-inflammatory cytokine release from DCs at levels higher than from
   iDCs. Dendritic cells treated with HA film expressed lower levels of
   CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR compared with iDCs. They also exhibited
   lower endocytic ability and CD44 expression than iDCs, possibly due to
   an insolubilized (cross-linked) form of high molecular weight HA.
   Interestingly, treatment of DCs with agarose film maintained the DC
   functional phenotype at levels similar to iDCs except for CD44
   expression, which was lower than that of iDCs. Taken together, these
   results can provide selection criteria for biomaterials to be used in
   immunomodulating applications and can inform potential outcomes of
   biomaterials within combination products on associated immune responses
   as desired by the application. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{The abundances, compositions, and activities of microbial communities
   were investigated at bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz
   Peatland of northwestern Minnesota. These sites contrast in the
   reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the presence or absence
   of groundwater inputs. Microbial community composition was characterized
   using pyrosequencing and clone library construction of phylogenetic
   marker genes. Microbial distribution patterns were linked to pH,
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, C/N ratios,
   optical properties of DOM, and activities of laccase and peroxidase
   enzymes. Both bacterial and archaeal richness and rRNA gene abundance
   were >2 times higher on average in the fen than in the bog, in agreement
   with a higher pH, labile DOM content, and enhanced enzyme activities in
   the fen. Fungi were equivalent to an average of 1.4\% of total
   prokaryotes in gene abundance assayed by quantitative PCR. Results
   revealed statistically distinct spatial patterns between bacterial and
   fungal communities. Fungal distribution did not covary with pH and DOM
   optical properties and was vertically stratified, with a prevalence of
   Ascomycota and Basidiomycota near the surface and much higher
   representation of Zygomycota in the subsurface. In contrast, bacterial
   community composition largely varied between environments, with the bog
   dominated by Acidobacteria (61\% of total sequences), while the
   Firmicutes (52\%) dominated in the fen. Acetoclastic Methanosarcinales
   showed a much higher relative abundance in the bog, in contrast to the
   dominance of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the fen. This is
   the first quantitative and compositional analysis of three microbial
   domains in peatlands and demonstrates that the microbial abundance,
   diversity, and activity parallel with the pronounced differences in
   environmental variables between bog and fen sites.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a systematic study on the seed-mediated growth of
   PdAu bimetallic nanocrystals with a variety of controlled morphologies.
   The key to the success of this synthesis is to manipulate the reaction
   kinetics by controlling a set of experimental parameters, which include
   the amount of ascorbic acid used as a reductant, the amount of HAuCl4 as
   a precursor to elemental Au, the reaction temperature, and the type of
   seeds employed. Starting from Pd nanocubes of 18 nm in edge length, PdAu
   bimetallic nanocrystals with a number of morphologies, which includes
   hybrid dimers, coreshell nanocubes with flat faces, and coreshell
   nanocubes with concave faces could all be obtained by simply speeding up
   the reduction of HAuCl4. The same synthesis and control could also be
   extended to seeds based on Pd octahedrons. For the first time, it was
   possible to generate Pd@Au coreshell nanocubes and octahedrons with
   concave faces. The Pd@Au coreshell nanocubes with concave faces
   exhibited enhanced activity in catalyzing the oxidization of ascorbic
   acid relative to their counterparts with flat faces or the cubic Pd
   seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle coordination may be difficult or impossible to predict accurately
   based on biomechanical considerations alone because of redundancy in the
   musculoskeletal system. Because many solutions exist for any given
   movement, the role of the nervous system in further constraining muscle
   coordination patterns for movement must be considered in both healthy
   and impaired motor control. On the basis of computational
   neuromechanical analyses of experimental data combined with modeling
   techniques, we have demonstrated several such neural constraints on the
   temporal and spatial patterns of muscle activity during both locomotion
   and postural responses to balance perturbations. We hypothesize that
   subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences in muscle activation can
   be parameterized and understood by a hierarchical and low-dimensional
   framework that reflects the neural control of task-level goals. In
   postural control, we demonstrate that temporal patterns of muscle
   activity may be governed by feedback control of task-level variables
   that represent the overall goal-directed motion of the body. These
   temporal patterns then recruit spatially-fixed patterns of muscle
   activity called muscle synergies that produce the desired task-level
   biomechanical functions that require multijoint coordination. Moreover,
   these principles apply more generally to movement, and in particular to
   locomotor tasks in both healthy and impaired individuals. Overall,
   understanding the goals and organization of the neural control of
   movement may provide useful reduced dimension parameter sets to address
   the degrees-of-freedom problem in musculoskeletal movement control. More
   importantly, however, neuromechanical analyses may lend insight and
   provide a framework for understanding subject-specific and
   trial-by-trial differences in movement across both healthy and
   motor-impaired populations. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromusculoskeletal models solve the basic problem of determining how
   the body moves under the influence of external and internal forces.
   Existing biomechanical modeling programs often emphasize dynamics with
   the goal of finding a feed-forward neural program to replicate
   experimental data or of estimating force contributions or individual
   muscles. The computation of rigid-body dynamics, muscle forces, and
   activation of the muscles are often performed separately. We have
   developed an intrinsically forward computational platform
   (Neuromechanic, www.neuromechanic.com) that explicitly represents the
   interdependencies among rigid body dynamics, frictional contact, muscle
   mechanics, and neural control modules. This formulation has significant
   advantages for optimization and forward simulation, particularly with
   application to neural controllers with feedback or regulatory features.
   Explicit inclusion of all state dependencies allows calculation of
   system derivatives with respect to kinematic states and muscle and
   neural control states, thus affording a wealth of analytical tools,
   including linearization, stability analyses and calculation of initial
   conditions for forward simulations. In this review, we describe our
   algorithm for generating state equations and explain how they may be
   used in integration, linearization, and stability analysis tools to
   provide structural insights into the neural control of movement.

Abstract = {{The condition monitoring of a rolling element bearing requires a

   are obtained via offline training. A genetic algorithm is applied to a
   set of data with various operating conditions and fault dimensions to
   achieve the optimal model parameters. The trained model is then used
   online in parallel with a real system in service to realize model-based
   fault detection and diagnosis. To increase the accuracy of diagnosis, an
   extended Kalman filter is used to address the noises and uncertainties
   associated with fault dimension estimation. The proposed system is
   implemented on a case study of rolling element bearing health monitoring

   the effective resistance saturates with an increase in the number of
   layers. The optimal number of layers to minimize the delay and the

   found that the optimal number of layers is a function of the

   interconnects with smooth edges perform better compared to copper wires.}},

Abstract = {{In electromagnetic machines, ferromagnetic material is one of the key
   components that affect the magnetic field and thus the output
   performance significantly. The objective of this paper is to study the
   influence of ferromagnetic material on magnetic field distribution of
   tubular electromagnetic linear machines. Generic magnetic field models
   are obtained for linear machines with various structure designs based on
   magnetic vector potential and Bessel functions. The magnetic field model
   is validated with numerical results from finite element calculations.
   The comparison between them shows that the flux model fits closely with
   the numerical computation. The obtained analytical model can be employed
   to study the flux density distribution of machine designs with
   single-sided, double-sided, and non back irons. It shows that the use of
   back iron, especially for the internal side, helps to greatly enhance
   the radial component of magnetic field. This component contributes to
   the axial force generation of tubular linear machines. The study could
   be useful for the design optimization of permanent-magnet linear
   machines.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial correlation of visual information retrieved from distributed
   camera sensors leads to considerable data redundancy in wireless video
   sensor networks, resulting in significant performance degradation in
   energy efficiency and quality-of-service (QoS) satisfaction. In this
   paper, a correlation-aware QoS routing algorithm (CAQR) is proposed to
   efficiently deliver visual information under QoS constraints by
   exploiting the correlation of visual information observed by different
   camera sensors. First, a correlation-aware inter-node differential
   coding scheme is designed to reduce the amount of traffic in the
   network. Then, a correlation-aware load balancing scheme is proposed to
   prevent network congestion by splitting the correlated flows that cannot
   be reduced to different paths. Finally, the correlation-aware schemes
   are integrated into an optimization QoS routing framework with an
   objective to minimize energy consumption subject to delay and
   reliability constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed routing algorithm achieves efficient delivery of visual
   information under QoS constraints in wireless video sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel framework, CloudView, for storage, processing and
   analysis of massive machine maintenance data, collected from a large
   number of sensors embedded in industrial machines, in a cloud computing
   environment. This paper describes the architecture, design, and
   implementation of CloudView, and how the proposed framework leverages
   the parallel computing capability of a computing cloud based on a
   large-scale distributed batch processing infrastructure that is built of
   commodity hardware. A case-based reasoning (CBR) approach is adopted for
   machine fault prediction, where the past cases of failure from a large
   number of machines are collected in a cloud. A case-base of past cases
   of failure is created using the global information obtained from a large
   number of machines. CloudView facilitates organization of sensor data
   and creation of case-base with global information. Case-base creation
   jobs are formulated using the MapReduce parallel data processing model.
   CloudView captures the failure cases across a large number of machines
   and shares the failure information with a number of local nodes in the
   form of case-base updates that occur in a time scale of every few hours.
   At local nodes, the real-time sensor data from a group of machines in
   the same facility/plant is continuously matched to the cases from the
   case-base for predicting the incipient faults-this local processing
   takes a much shorter time of a few seconds. The case-base is updated
   regularly (in the time scale of a few hours) on the cloud to include new
   cases of failure, and these case-base updates are pushed from CloudView
   to the local nodes. Experimental measurements show that fault
   predictions can be done in real-time (on a timescale of seconds) at the
   local nodes and massive machine data analysis for case-base creation and
   updating can be done on a timescale of minutes in the cloud. Our
   approach, in addition to being the first reported use of the cloud
   architecture for maintenance data storage, processing and analysis, also
   evaluates several possible cloud-based architectures that leverage the
   advantages of the parallel computing capabilities of the cloud to make
   local decisions with global information efficiently, while avoiding
   potential data bottlenecks that can occur in getting the maintenance
   data in and out of the cloud.}},

   used in signal and image processing, with emerging applications in
   autonomous sensing and perception systems. The proposed motion planner
   enables the simultaneous use of the wavelet transform in both the
   perception and in the motion-planning layers of vehicle autonomy, thus
   potentially reducing online computations. We rigorously prove the

Abstract = {{While the complexity of modern engineering systems is significantly
   mitigated by modularization, the number of modules (e.g.,
   line-replaceable units) can still be large enough to pose a challenge of
   developing a coordinated maintenance policy that accounts for the
   coupling among individual maintenance schedules for each module. This
   paper focuses on opportunistic maintenance, induced failure, and other
   coupling mechanisms caused by competing risk phenomena. Modeling the
   maintenance process of an individual module or component, even if it
   includes modern condition-based considerations, can be described by a
   relatively small number of distinct states. In contrast, creating a
   system-level model that captures all relevant coupling leads to a
   state-space explosion: an implementation of such models is either very
   expensive or not feasible at all. To address this issue, the present
   paper explores the idea of developing component-level models that
   incorporate the aggregate effects of other components by providing a
   compact statistical representation of the combined influence on a given
   component of all other system components. This approach is somewhat
   analogous to the mean-field theory used in physics to avoid explicit
   description of pair-wise interactions. An analytical method based on
   asymptotic considerations is developed for combining the effects of
   multiple components into a single Weibull distribution (inspection
   intervals are assumed to be smaller than the failure scale). The
   accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by successfully representing
   the combined effect of two competing Weibull distributions as well as
   the combined effect of two competing lognormal distributions. In
   particular, it is shown that the proposed method provides a superior
   match for the combined distribution in the relevant time range as
   compared to standard methods of approximating a distribution (e.g.,
   matching moments or using the maximum likelihood estimate). The accuracy
   of representing opportunities using exponential distributions is
   explored as well. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although multiple culture assays have been designed to identify
   endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the phenotype of cells grown in
   culture often remains undefined. We sought to define and characterize
   the proangiogenic cell population within human peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood
   and grown under angiogenic conditions for 7 days. Formed colonies
   (CFU-As) were identified and analyzed for proliferation, mRNA and
   surface antigen expression, tube-forming ability, and chromosomal
   content. Colonies were composed of a heterogeneous group of cells
   expressing the leukocyte antigens CD45, CD14, and CD3, as well as the
   endothelial proteins vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin, von
   Willebrand's factor (vWF), CD31, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
   (eNOS). Colony cells expressed increased levels of proangiogenic growth
   factors, and they formed tubes in Matrigel. In comparison with colonies
   from the CFU-Hill assay, our assay resulted in a greater number of
   colonies (19 +/- 9 vs. 13 +/- 7; p < 0.0001) with a substantial number
   of cells expressing an endothelial phenotype (20.2\% +/- 7.4\% vs. 2.2\%
   +/- 1.2\% expressing eNOS, p = 0.0006). Chromosomal analysis indicated
   the colony cells were bone marrow derived. We, therefore, describe a
   colony-forming unit assay that measures bone marrow-derived circulating
   mononuclear cells with the capacity to proliferate and mature into
   proangiogenic leukocytic and endothelial-like cells. This assay,
   therefore, reflects circulating, bone marrow-derived proangiogenic
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular injury mobilizes bone marrow-derived proangiogenic cells into
   the circulation, where these cells can facilitate vascular repair and
   new vessel formation. We sought to determine the relationship between a
   new biomarker of circulating bone marrow-derived proangiogenic cell
   activity, the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   and its risk factors, and clinical outcomes. Circulating proangiogenic
   cell activity was estimated using a reproducible angiogenic
   colony-forming unit (CFU-A) assay in 532 clinically stable subjects aged
   20 to 90 years and ranging in the CVD risk spectrum from those who are
   healthy without risk factors to those with active CVD. CFU-A counts
   increased with the burden of CVD risk factors (p < 0.001). CFU-A counts
   were higher in subjects with symptomatic CVD than in those without (p <
   0.001). During follow-up of 232 subjects with CVD, CFU-A counts were
   higher in those with death, myocardial infarction, or stroke than in
   those without (110 {[}70-173] vs 84 {[}51-136], p = 0.01). Therefore, we
   conclude that circulating proangiogenic cell activity, as estimated by
   CFU-A counts, increases with CVD risk factor burden and in the presence
   of established CVD. Furthermore, higher circulating proangiogenic cell
   activity is associated with worse clinical outcome in those with CVD.}},

Abstract = {{Geometric distortion caused by field inhomogeneity along the
   phase-encode direction is one of the most prominent artifacts due to a
   relatively low effective bandwidth along that direction in magnetic
   resonance echo planar imaging. This work describes a method for
   correcting in-plane image distortion along the phase-encode direction
   using a view angle tilting imaging technique in spin-echo echo planar
   imaging. Spin-echo echo planar imaging with view angle tilting uses the
   addition of gradient blips along the slice-select direction,
   concurrently applied with the phase-encode gradient blips, producing an
   additional phase. This phase effectively offsets an unwanted phase
   accumulation caused by field inhomogeneity, resulting in the removal of
   image distortion along the phase-encode direction. The proposed method
   is simple and straightforward both in implementation and application
   with no scan time penalty. Therefore, it is readily applicable on
   commercial scanners without having any customized postprocessing. The
   efficacy of the spin-echo echo planar imaging with view angle tilting
   technique in the correction of image distortion is demonstrated in
   phantom and in vivo brain imaging. Magn Reson Med, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Models for decision-making under uncertainty use probability
   distributions to represent variables whose values are unknown when the
   decisions are to be made. Often the distributions are estimated with
   observed data. Sometimes these variables depend on the decisions but the
   dependence is ignored in the decision maker's model, that is, the
   decision maker models these variables as having an exogenous probability
   distribution independent of the decisions, whereas the probability
   distribution of the variables actually depend on the decisions. It has
   been shown in the context of revenue management problems that such
   modeling error can lead to systematic deterioration of decisions as the
   decision maker attempts to refine the estimates with observed data. Many
   questions remain to be addressed. Motivated by the revenue management,
   newsvendor, and a number of other problems, we consider a setting in
   which the optimal decision for the decision maker's model is given by a
   particular quantile of the estimated distribution, and the empirical
   distribution is used as estimator. We give conditions under which the
   estimation and control process converges, and show that although in the
   limit the decision maker's model appears to be consistent with the
   observed data, the modeling error can cause the limit decisions to be
   arbitrarily bad.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of slot die geometry, substrate geometry, and fluid
   properties on air entrainment in coatings have been extensively
   investigated by several researchers in the past. However, no studies
   exist to explain the bubble breakup mechanisms during slot die coating
   of highly viscous, shear- thinning solutions. An experimental study is
   performed to understand the bubble breakup mechanisms and the
   qualitative impact of geometric conditions and viscosity of the coating
   solution on the sizes of the air bubbles. Blackstrap molasses and dilute
   blackstrap molasses are used as the primary test solutions in this
   study. Two bubble breakup mechanisms were identified based on the shape
   of the sawteeth formed prior to air entrainment. In addition, smaller
   slot and coating gaps and high viscosity solutions were found to produce
   smaller bubble sizes. For example, reducing slot gap by 41\% resulted in
   a 58\% reduction in the effective bubble diameter. It was also found
   that as the dynamic contact angle approaches 180 with increasing
   velocity, the behavior follows that of the interface formation model.

Abstract = {{A single-element shear-coaxial combustor using gaseous hydrogen (GH(2))
   and oxygen (GO(2)) was designed and hot-tested. The wall temperature was
   measured. The combustion flow-field of this GH(2)/GO(2) single-element
   combustor was modeled by RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) and LES
   (Large Eddy Simulation) methods respectively. The impact of using
   various turbulence and turbulent combustion models was investigated to
   obtain the model combination which best represented the experimental
   data in the RANS modeling. The flamelet model was used in the LES
   modeling and the validity of its application to the GH(2)/GO(2)
   combustion in the combustor was carefully examined. The combustor wall
   heat flux distributions of both RANS and LES results show good agreement
   with the experimental data. The experimental wall temperature
   distribution can be clearly explained through analyzing the inner
   flowfield structure. The results indicate that both RANS and LES used in
   this paper can give good predictions of the development of the whole
   flowfield and the combustion completion length. LES can resolve
   large-scale flow motions in the combustor and accurately predict the
   influence of the wall heat loss on the combustion efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Microtexture and chemistry of implant surfaces are important variables
   for modulating cellular responses. Surface chemistry and wettability are
   connected directly. While each of these surface properties can influence
   cell response, it is difficult to decouple their specific contributions.
   To address this problem, the aims of this study were to develop a
   surface wettability gradient with a specific chemistry without altering
   micron scale roughness and to investigate the role of surface
   wettability on osteoblast response. Microtextured
   sandblasted/acid-etched (SLA, Sa = 3.1 mu m) titanium disks were treated
   with oxygen plasma to increase reactive oxygen density on the surface.
   At 0, 2, 6, 10, and 24 h after removing them from the plasma, the
   surfaces were coated with chitosan for 30 min, rinsed and dried.
   Modified SLA surfaces are denoted as SLA/h in air prior to coating.
   Surface characterization demonstrated that this process yielded
   differing wettability (SLA0 < SLA2 < SLA10 < SLA24) without modifying
   the micron scale features of the surface. Cell number was reduced in a
   wettability-dependent manner, except for the most water-wettable
   surface, SLA24. There was no difference in alkaline phosphatase activity
   with differing wettability. Increased wettability yielded increased
   osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin production, except on the SLA24
   surfaces. mRNA for integrins alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, and beta
   3 was sensitive to surface wettability. However, surface wettability did
   not affect mRNA levels for integrin alpha 3. Silencing beta 1 increased
   cell number with reduced osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin in a
   wettability-dependent manner. Surface wettability as a primary regulator
   enhanced osteoblast differentiation, but integrin expression and
   silencing beta 1 results indicate that surface wettability regulates
   osteoblast through differential integrin expression profiles than
   microtexture does. The results may indicate that both microtexture and
   wettability with a specific chemistry have important regulatory effects
   on osseointegration. Each property had different effects, which were
   mediated by different integrin receptors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Intra-articular delivery of therapeutics to modulate osteoarthritis (OA)
   is challenging. Delivery of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra),
   the natural protein inhibitor of IL-1, to modulate IL-1-based
   inflammation through gene therapy or bolus protein injections has
   emerged as a promising therapy for OA. However, these approaches suffer
   from rapid clearance and reduced potency over time. Nano/microparticles
   represent a promising strategy for overcoming the shortcomings of
   intra-articular drug delivery. However, these delivery vehicles are
   limited for delivery of protein therapeutics due to their hydrophobic
   character, low drug loading efficiency, and harsh chemical conditions
   during particle processing. We designed a new block copolymer that
   assembles into submicron-scale particles and provides for covalently
   tethering proteins to the particle surface; for controlled
   intra-articular protein delivery. This block copolymer self-assembles
   into 300 nm-diameter particles with a protein tethering moiety for
   surface covalent conjugation of IL-1Ra protein. This copolymer particle
   system efficiently bound IL-1Ra and maintained protein bioactivity in
   vitro. Furthermore, particle-tethered IL-1Ra bound specifically to
   target synoviocyte cells via surface IL-1 receptors. Importantly, IL-1Ra
   nanoparticles inhibited IL-1-mediated signaling to equivalent levels as
   soluble IL-1Ra. Finally, the ability of nanoparticles to retain IL-1Ra
   in the rat stifle joint was evaluated by in vivo imaging over 14 days.
   IL-1Ra-tethered nanoparticles significantly increased the retention time
   of IL-1Ra in the rat stifle joint over 14 days with enhanced IL-1Ra
   half-life (3.01 days) compared to that of soluble IL-1Ra (0.96 days) and
   without inducing degenerative changes in cartilage structure or
   composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Study of Ductile-to-Brittle Transition in Single Grit Diamond Scribing

Abstract = {{The ductile-to-brittle cutting mode transition in single grit diamond
   scribing of monocrystalline silicon is investigated in this paper.
   Specifically, the effects of scriber tip geometry, coefficient of
   friction, and external hydrostatic pressure on the critical depth of cut
   associated with ductile-to-brittle transition and crack generation are
   studied via an eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) based model, which
   is experimentally validated. Scribers with a large tip radius are shown
   to produce lower tensile stresses and a larger critical depth of cut
   compared with scribers with a sharp tip. Spherical tipped scribers are
   shown to generate only surface cracks, while sharp tipped scribers
   (conical, Berkovich and Vickers) are found to create large subsurface
   tensile stresses, which can lead to nucleation of subsurface
   median/lateral cracks. Lowering the friction coefficient tends to
   increase the critical depth of cut and hence the extent of ductile mode
   cutting. The results also show that larger critical depth of cut can be
   obtained under external hydrostatic pressure. This knowledge is expected
   to be useful in optimizing the design and application of the diamond
   coated wire employed in fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing of
   photovoltaic silicon wafers.}},

Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{84-101}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method which is an improvement over the
   consistent generalized energy condensation theory in which the energy
   dependence of the angular flux and cross sections is expanded in
   continuous or discrete orthogonal basis functions. The method extends
   the cross section condensation process, preserving spectral accuracy in
   condensed-group transport calculations in a simpler and more direct
   manner, without the need for this expansion in energy. The new ``group
   decomposition{''} method directly couples a consistent coarse-group
   criticality calculation with a set of fixed-source ``decomposition
   sweeps{''} to obtain the fine-group spectrum without the need to solve
   for higher energy moments of the flux. The method is derived in general
   geometry and verified with a 1D discrete ordinates lattice cell problem.
   In addition, one significant application of the method in whole-core
   reactor analysis, cross section recondensation, is explored in detail
   and shown to be highly effective at correcting the cross sections
   on-the-fly for spectral core environment effects. This is demonstrated
   with two 1D benchmark problems characteristic of LWR and VHTR systems.

Abstract = {{Local hemodynamics may strongly influence atherothrombosis, which can
   lead to acute myocardial infarction and stroke. The relationship between
   hemodynamics and thrombosis during platelet accumulation was studied
   through an in vitro flow system consisting of a stenosis. Specifically,
   wall shear rates (WSR) ranging from 0 to 100,000?s-1 were ascertained
   through computations and compared with thrombus growth rates found by
   image analysis for over 5,000 individual observation points per
   experiment. A positive correlation (P<0.0001) was found between thrombus
   accumulation rates and WSR up to 6,000?s-1, with a decrease in growth
   rates at WSR >6,000?s-1 (P?<?0.0001). Furthermore, growth rates at
   pathological shear rates were found to be two to four times greater than
   for physiological arterial shear rates below 400?s-1. Platelets did not
   accumulate for the first minute of perfusion. The initial lag time,
   before discernible thrombus growth could be found, diminished with shear
   (P?<?0.0001). These studies show the quantitative increase in thrombus
   growth rates with very high shear rates in stenoses onto a collagen

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of different-sized nanoparticles on
   potential cytotoxicity in intestinal epithelia. Three sizes of hematite
   nanoparticles were used for the study at a 10 ppm concentration: 17, 53,
   and, 100 nm. Results indicate that, of the hematite nanoparticles
   tested, 17 nm was more toxic to the epithelial integrity than 53 or 100
   nm. In addition, the epithelial integrity was affected by disruption of
   epithelial structures such as apical microvilli, and by disruption of
   the cell-cell junctions leading to reduction in transepithelial
   electrical resistance measurements (TEER). The drop in TEER was caused
   by disruption of the adhering junctions not by cell death, as determined
   by immunocytochemistry, and by using a cell viability assay. Epithelial
   integrity was also affected at the molecular level as shown by
   differential expression of genes related to cell junction maintenance,
   which was assessed by microarray analysis. In conclusion, the 17- and
   100-nm hematite nanoparticles caused significant structural changes in
   the epithelium but not the 53 nm nanoparticles. Also, different-sized
   hematite nanoparticles each had different effects both at the cellular
   level and genetic level.}},

Title = {{Compact Quantum Dots for Single-molecule Imaging}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{68}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Single-molecule imaging is an important tool for understanding the
   mechanisms of biomolecular function and for visualizing the spatial and
   temporal heterogeneity of molecular behaviors that underlie cellular
   biology (1-4). To image an individual molecule of interest, it is
   typically conjugated to a fluorescent tag (dye, protein, bead, or
   quantum dot) and observed with epifluorescence or total internal
   reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. While dyes and fluorescent
   proteins have been the mainstay of fluorescence imaging for decades,
   their fluorescence is unstable under high photon fluxes necessary to
   observe individual molecules, yielding only a few seconds of observation
   before complete loss of signal. Latex beads and dye-labeled beads
   provide improved signal stability but at the expense of drastically
   larger hydrodynamic size, which can deleteriously alter the diffusion
   and behavior of the molecule under study.
   Quantum dots (QDs) offer a balance between these two problematic
   regimes. These nanoparticles are composed of semiconductor materials and
   can be engineered with a hydrodynamically compact size with exceptional
   resistance to photodegradation (5). Thus in recent years QDs have been
   instrumental in enabling long-term observation of complex macromolecular
   behavior on the single molecule level. However these particles have
   still been found to exhibit impaired diffusion in crowded molecular
   environments such as the cellular cytoplasm and the neuronal synaptic
   cleft, where their sizes are still too large (4,6,7).
   Recently we have engineered the cores and surface coatings of QDs for
   minimized hydrodynamic size, while balancing offsets to colloidal
   stability, photostability, brightness, and nonspecific binding that have
   hindered the utility of compact QDs in the past (8,9). The goal of this
   article is to demonstrate the synthesis, modification, and
   characterization of these optimized nanocrystals, composed of an alloyed
   HgxCd1-xSe core coated with an insulating CdyZn1-yS shell, further
   coated with a multidentate polymer ligand modified with short
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains (Figure 1). Compared with conventional
   CdSe nanocrystals, HgxCd1-xSe alloys offer greater quantum yields of
   fluorescence, fluorescence at red and near-infrared wavelengths for
   enhanced signal-to-noise in cells, and excitation at non-cytotoxic
   visible wavelengths. Multidentate polymer coatings bind to the
   nanocrystal surface in a closed and flat conformation to minimize
   hydrodynamic size, and PEG neutralizes the surface charge to minimize
   nonspecific binding to cells and biomolecules. The end result is a
   brightly fluorescent nanocrystal with emission between 550-800 nm and a
   total hydrodynamic size near 12 nm. This is in the same size range as
   many soluble globular proteins in cells, and substantially smaller than
   conventional PEGylated QDs (25-35 nm).}},

Abstract = {{The interrelationships among suture fusion, basicranial development, and
   subsequent resynostosis in syndromic craniosynostosis have yet to be
   examined. The objectives of this study were to determine the potential
   relationship between suture fusion and cranial base development in a
   model of syndromic craniosynostosis and to assess the effects of the
   syndrome on resynostosis following suturectomy. To do this, posterior
   frontal and coronal suture fusion, postnatal development of
   sphenooccipital synchondrosis, and resynostosis in Twist1(+/+) (WT) and
   Twist1(+/-) litter-matched mice (a model for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome)
   were quantified by evaluating mu CT images with advanced
   image-processing algorithms. The coronal suture in Twist(+/-) mice
   developed, fused, and mineralized at a faster rate than that in normal
   littermates at postnatal days 6-30. Moreover, premature fusion of the
   coronal suture in Twist1(+/-) mice preceded alterations in cranial base
   development. Analysis of synchondrosis showed faster mineralization in
   Twist(+/-) mice at postnatal days 25-30. In a rapid resynostosis model,
   there was an inability to fuse both the midline posterior frontal suture
   and craniotomy defects in 21-day-old Twist(+/-) mice, despite having
   accelerated mineralization in the posterior frontal suture and defects.
   This study showed that dissimilarities between Twist1(+/+) and
   Twist1(+/-) mice are not limited to a fused coronal suture but include
   differences in fusion of other sutures, the regenerative capacity of the
   cranial vault, and the development of the cranial base.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the Gauss-Newton method as a unified approach
   to estimating noise parameters of the prevalent nonlinear compensation
   models, such as vector Taylor series (VTS), data-driven parallel model
   combination (DPMC), and unscented transform (UT), for noise-robust
   speech recognition. While iterative estimation of noise means in a
   generalized EM framework has been widely known, we demonstrate that such
   approaches are variants of the Gauss-Newton method. Furthermore, we
   propose a novel noise variance estimation algorithm that is consistent
   with the Gauss-Newton principle. The formulation of the Gauss-Newton
   method reduces the noise estimation problem to determining the Jacobians
   of the corrupted speech parameters. For sampling-based compensations, we
   present two methods, sample Jacobian average (SJA) and cross-covariance
   (XCOV), to evaluate these Jacobians. The proposed noise estimation
   algorithm is evaluated for various compensation models on two tasks. The
   first is to fit a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) model to artificially
   corrupted samples, and the second is to perform speech recognition on
   the Aurora 2 database. The significant performance improvements confirm
   the efficacy of the Gauss-Newton method to estimating the noise
   parameters of the nonlinear compensation models.}},

Abstract = {{Many network processing applications require wirespeed access to large
   data structures or a large amount of packet and flow-level data.
   Therefore, it is essential for the memory system of a router to be able
   to support both read and write accesses to such data at link speeds. As
   link speeds continue to increase, router designers are constantly
   grappling with the unfortunate trade-offs between the speed and cost of
   SRAM and DRAM. The capacity of SRAMs is woefully inadequate in many
   cases and it proves too costly to store large data structures entirely
   in SRAM, while DRAM is viewed as too slow for providing wirespeed
   updates at such high speed. In this paper, we analyze a robust pipelined
   memory architecture that can emulate an ideal SRAM by guaranteeing with
   very high probability that the output sequence produced by the pipelined
   memory architecture is the same as the one produced by an ideal SRAM
   under the same sequence of memory read and write operations, except time
   shifted by a fixed pipeline delay of Delta. Given a fixed pipeline delay
   abstraction, no interrupt mechanism is required to indicate when read
   data are ready or a write operation has completed, which greatly
   simplifies the use of the proposed solution. The design is based on the
   interleaving of DRAM banks together with the use of a reservation table
   that serves in part as a data cache. In contrast to prior interleaved
   memory solutions, our design is robust under all memory access patterns,
   including adversarial ones, which we demonstrate through a rigorous
   worst case theoretical analysis using a combination of convex ordering
   and large deviation theory.}},

Title = {{Detecting Curves with Unknown Endpoints and Arbitrary Topology Using

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Existing state-of-the-art minimal path techniques work well to extract
   simple open curves in images when both endpoints of the curve are given
   as user input or when one input is given and the total length of the
   curve is known in advance. Curves which branch require even further
   prior input from the user, namely, each branch endpoint. In this work,
   we present a novel minimal path-based algorithm which works on much more
   general curve topologies with far fewer demands on the user for initial
   input compared to prior minimal path-based algorithms. The two key
   novelties and benefits of this new approach are that 1) it may be used
   to detect both open and closed curves, including more complex topologies
   containing both multiple branch points and multiple closed cycles
   without requiring a priori knowledge about which of these types is to be
   extracted, and 2) it requires only a single input point which, in
   contrast to existing methods, is no longer constrained to be an endpoint
   of the desired curve but may in fact be ANY point along the desired
   curve (even an internal point). We perform quantitative evaluation of
   the algorithm on 48 images (44 pavement crack images, 1 catheter tube
   image, and 3 retinal images) against human supplied ground truth. The
   results demonstrate that the algorithm is indeed able to extract
   curve-like objects accurately from images with far less prior knowledge
   and less user interaction compared to existing state-of-the-art minimal
   path-based image processing algorithms. In the future, the algorithm can
   be applied to other 2D curve-like objects and it can be extended to
   detect 3D curves.}},

Title = {{Rapid membrane responses to dihydrotestosterone are sex dependent in
   growth plate chondrocytes}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{132}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Sex steroids are important regulators for longitudinal growth, bone mass
   accrual, and sexual dimorphism of the skeleton. 17 beta-Estradiol
   regulates proliferation and differentiation of female chondrocytes via a
   membrane-associated signaling pathway in addition to its estrogen
   receptor (ER) mediated effects. In contrast, testosterone does not
   elicit a similar membrane response, either in male or female cells.
   Whereas female rat growth plate chondrocytes convert testosterone to 17
   beta-estradiol, male chondrocytes produce 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone
   (DHT). Previously DHT was found to mediate sex-specific effects of
   testosterone in male cells, but it is not known if a membrane-signaling
   pathway is involved. In this study, we hypothesized that DHT can induce
   sex-specific rapid membrane effects similar to other steroid hormones.
   Confluent cultures of chondrocytes isolated from resting zones of growth
   plates of both male and female rats were treated with 10(-10)-10(-7) M
   testosterone or DHT for 3, 9, 90 and 270 min and protein kinase C (PKC)
   and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities were measured. To examine
   potential signaling pathways involved in PKC activation, male
   chondrocytes were treated with 10(-7) M DHT for 9 min in the presence or
   absence of the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, the secretory
   PLA2 inhibitor quinacrine or the cytosolic PLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3; the G
   alpha i inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) or Gas activator cholera toxin
   (CTX), and the general G-protein inhibitor GDP beta S; thapsigargin, an
   inhibitor of a Ca-ATPase pump in the endoplasmic reticulum; verapamil
   and nifedipine, inhibitors of specific L type Ca2+ channels on the cell
   membrane; and cyproterone acetate (CPA), which is an inhibitor of the
   classical androgen receptor (AR); as well as the transcription inhibitor
   actinomycin D, or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. DHT induced a
   dose-dependent increase in PKC and PLA2 activity in male cells with the
   highest increase at 10(-7) M DHT (p<0.05), whereas testosterone had no
   effect. PKC activity was augmented at 9 and 90 min, and then decreased
   to baseline at 270 min. Neither testosterone nor DHT affected PKC in
   female cells. U73122, quinacrine, and AACOCF3 inhibited DHT-induced
   activation of PKC. DHT treatment for 9 min had no effect in
   {[}H-3]-thymidine incorporation in quiescent confluent cultures but
   caused a dose dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase specific
   activity. Inhibition of PLC reduced the response of to DHT in a dose
   dependent manner, indicating that PLC is involved. In conclusion, our
   study indicates that DHT, but not testosterone, has sex-specific rapid
   membrane effects in male growth plate chondrocytes involving PLC and
   PLA2-mediated PKC signaling pathways. Together with previous
   observations showing that male cells convert testosterone to DHT, these
   results suggest that DHT might act in the membrane through an
   autocrine/paracrine mechanism. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25D3) regulates musculoskeletal cells
   via two different mechanisms: vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent gene
   transcription and rapid membrane-signaling via VDR as well as protein
   disulfide isomerase, family A, member 3 (Pdia3). In chondrocytes from
   the costochondral cartilage growth zone (GC), ligand binding to Pdia3
   causes a rapid increase in phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity leading
   to release of arachidonic acid and formation of lysophospholipid (LPL).
   LPL activates phospholipase C (PLC), and resulting inositol
   trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol contribute to PKC alpha
   activation and downstream activation of ERK1/2. PLA(2) activating
   protein (PLAA) is increased in the growth zone of rat growth plates
   suggesting that it mediates the 1,25D3-dependent pathway. This study
   examined the role of PLAA in mediating 1,25D3-dependent PKC activation
   using GC cells and MC3T3-E1 wild-type and PLAA-silenced osteoblasts as
   models. PLAA, Pdia3, and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) were detected in plasma
   membranes and caveolae of GC and MC3T3-E1 cells.
   Pdia3-immunoprecipitated samples were positive for PLAA only after
   1,2503 treatment. Cav-1 was detected when immunoprecipitated with
   anti-Pdia3 and anti-PLAA in both vehicle and 1,25D3 treated cells. These
   observations were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. 1,25D3 failed to
   activate PLA(2) and PKC or cause PGE(2) release in PLAA-silenced cells.
   PIAA-antibody successfully blocked the PLAA protein and consequently
   suppressed PKC activity in GC and MC3T3-E1 cells. Crosslinking studies
   confirmed the localization of PLAA on the extracellular face on the
   plasma membrane in untreated MC3T3-E1 cells. Taken together, our results
   suggest that PLAA is an important mediator of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 rapid
   membrane mediated signaling. 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 likely causes
   conformational changes bringing Pdia3 into proximity with PLAA, and
   aiding in transducing the signal from caveolae to the plasma membrane.

Abstract = {{T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) on the surface of T cells bind
   specifically to particular peptide bound major histocompatibility
   complexes (pMHCs) presented on the surface of antigen presenting cells
   (APCs). This interaction is a key event in T cell antigen recognition
   and activation. Most studies have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   to measure the in vitro binding kinetics of TCR-pMHC interactions in
   solution using purified proteins. However, these measurements are not
   physiologically precise, as both TCRs and pMHCs are membrane-associated
   molecules which are regulated by their cellular environments. Recently,
   single-molecule forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and
   single-molecule mechanical assays were used to measure the in situ
   binding kinetics of TCR-pMHC interactions on the surface of live T
   cells. These studies have provided exciting insights into the
   biochemical basis of T cell antigen recognition and suggest that TCRs
   serially engage with a small number of antigens with very fast kinetics
   in order to maximize TCR signaling and sensitivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new self-healing methodology for embedded RF
   amplifiers in RF sub-systems. The proposed methodology is based on
   oscillation principles in which the device-under-test (DUT) generates
   its test signature with the help of additional circuitry. In the
   proposed methodology, the self-generated test signature from the RF
   amplifier is analyzed by using on-chip resources for testing and
   controlling its calibration knobs to compensate for multi-parameter
   variations in the manufacturing process. Thus, the proposed methodology
   enables self-test and self-calibration/correction of RF amplifiers
   without the need for an external test stimulus, enabling true
   self-healing RF designs. The proposed methodology is demonstrated
   through simulations as well as measurements performed on an RF LNA,
   which were designed in a commercially-available SiGe BiCMOS process
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{Large doses of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) are used clinically
   to induce bone formation in challenging bone defects. However,
   complications after treatment include swelling, ectopic bone formation,
   and adjacent bone resorption. While BMP2 can be effective, it is
   important to characterize the mechanism of the deleterious effects to
   optimize its use. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
   BMP2 on apoptosis in osteoblast lineage cells and to determine the role
   of the BMP inhibitor Noggin in this process. Human mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs), immature osteoblast-like MG63 cells, and mature normal
   human osteoblasts (NHOst) were treated with BMP2. A model system of
   increased endogenous BMP signaling was created by silencing Noggin
   (shNOG-MG63). Finally, the BMP pathway regulating apoptosis in NHOst was
   examined using BMP signaling inhibitors (5Z-7-oxozeaenol, dorsomorphin,
   H-8). Apoptosis was characterized by caspase-3, BAX/BCL2, p53, and DNA
   fragmentation. BMP2 induced apoptosis in a cell-type dependent manner.
   While the effect was minor in MSCs, MG63 cells had modest increases and
   NHOst cells had robust increases apoptosis after BMP2 treatment.
   Apoptosis was significantly higher in shNOG-MG63 than MG63 cells.
   5Z-7-oxozeaenol and dorsomorphin eliminated the BMP2-induced increase in
   DNA fragmentation in NHOst, suggesting roles for TAB/TAK1 and Smad
   signaling. These results indicate that the apoptotic effect of BMP2 is
   dependent on cell maturation state, inducing apoptosis in committed
   osteoblasts through Smad and TAB/TAK1 signaling, and is regulated by
   Noggin. Dose and delivery must be optimized in therapeutic applications
   of BMP2 to minimize complications. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 32363245,

Abstract = {{Managing shelf space is critical for retailers to attract customers and
   optimize profits. This article develops a shelf-space allocation
   optimization model that explicitly incorporates essential in-store costs
   and considers space- and cross-elasticities. A piecewise linearization
   technique is used to approximate the complicated nonlinear
   space-allocation model. The approximation reformulates the non-convex
   optimization problem into a linear mixed integer programming (MIP)
   problem. The MIP solution not only generates near-optimal solutions for
   large scale optimization problems, but also provides an error bound to
   evaluate the solution quality. Consequently, the proposed approach can
   solve single category-shelf space management problems with as many
   products as are typically encountered in practice and with more
   complicated cost and profit structures than currently possible by
   existing methods. Numerical experiments show the competitive accuracy of
   the proposed method compared with the mixed integer nonlinear
   programming shelf-space model. Several extensions of the main model are
   discussed to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed methodology. (C)

Abstract = {{TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) sensitized by palladium quantum dots (Pd
   QDs) exhibit highly efficient photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation.
   Vertically oriented TNTAs were prepared by a three-step electrochemical
   anodization. Subsequently, Pd QDs with uniform size and narrow size
   distribution were formed on TiO2 nanotubes by a modified hydrothermal
   reaction (i.e., yielding nanocomposites of Pd QDs deposited on TNTAs,
   Pd@TNTAs). By exploiting Pd@TNTA nanocomposites as both photoanode and
   cathode, a substantially increased photon-to-current conversion
   efficiency of nearly 100\% at lambda = 330 nm and a greatly promoted
   photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 592 mu mol.h(-1).cm(-2) under
   320 mW.cm(-2) irradiation were achieved. The synergy between nanotubular
   structures of TiO2 and uniformly dispersed Pd QDs on TiO2 facilitated
   the charge transfer of photoinduced electrons from TiO2 nanotubes to Pd
   QDs and the high activity of Pd QDs catalytic center, thereby leading to
   high-efficiency photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a systematic study of the nucleation and growth
   of Ag (and Au) on Pd nanocrystal seeds. By carefully controlling the
   reaction kinetics, the newly formed Ag atoms could be directed to
   selectively nucleate and then epitaxially grow on a specific number
   (ranging from one to six) of the six faces on a cubic Pd seed, leading
   to the formation of bimetallic nanocrystals with a variety of different
   structures. In addition to changing the injection rate of precursor, we
   also systematically investigated other reaction parameters including the
   capping agent, reductant, and reaction temperature. Our results suggest
   that the site-selective growth of Ag on cubic Pd seeds could be readily
   realized by optimizing these reaction parameters. On the basis of the
   positions of Pd seeds inside the bimetallic nanocrystals as revealed by
   TEM imaging and elemental mapping, we could identify the exact growth
   pathways and achieve a clear and thorough understanding of the
   mechanisms. We have successfully applied the same strategy based on
   kinetic control to cubic Pd seeds with different sizes and octahedral Pd
   seeds of one size to generate an array of novel bimetallic nanocrystals
   with well-controlled structures. With cubic Pd seeds as an example, we
   have also extended this strategy to the Pd-Au system. We believe this
   work will provide a promising route to the fabrication of bimetallic
   nanocrystals with novel structures and properties for applications in
   plasmonics, catalysis, and other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Total cavopulmonary connection is the result of a series of palliative
   surgical repairs performed on patients with single ventricle heart
   defects. The resulting anatomy has complex and unsteady hemodynamics
   characterized by flow mixing and flow separation. Although varying
   degrees of flow pulsatility have been observed in vivo, non-pulsatile
   (time-averaged) boundary conditions have traditionally been assumed in
   hemodynamic modeling, and only recently have pulsatile conditions been
   incorporated without completely characterizing their effect or
   importance. In this study, 3D numerical simulations with both pulsatile
   and non-pulsatile boundary conditions were performed for 24 patients
   with different anatomies and flow boundary conditions from Georgia Tech
   database. Flow structures, energy dissipation rates and pressure drops
   were compared under rest and simulated exercise conditions. It was found
   that flow pulsatility is the primary factor in determining the
   appropriate choice of boundary conditions, whereas the anatomic
   configuration and cardiac output had secondary effects. Results show
   that the hemodynamics can be strongly influenced by the presence of
   pulsatile flow. However, there was a minimum pulsatility threshold,
   identified by defining a weighted pulsatility index (wPI), above which
   the influence was significant. It was shown that when wPI < 30\%, the
   relative error in hemodynamic predictions using time-averaged boundary
   conditions was less than 10\% compared to pulsatile simulations. In
   addition, when wPI < 50, the relative error was less than 20\%. A
   correlation was introduced to relate wPI to the relative error in
   predicting the flow metrics with non-pulsatile flow conditions. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The complex three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the native tricuspid
   aortic valve (AV) is represented by select parametric curves allowing
   for a general construction and representation of the 3D-AV structure
   including the cusps, commissures and sinuses. The proposed general
   mathematical description is performed by using three independent
   parametric curves, two for the cusp and one for the sinuses. These
   curves are used to generate different surfaces that form the structure
   of the AV. Additional dependent curves are also generated and utilized
   in this process, such as the joint curve between the cusps and the
   sinuses. The model's feasibility to generate patient-specific parametric
   geometry is examined against 3D-transesophageal echocardiogram (3D-TEE)
   measurements from a non-pathological AV. Computational finite-element
   (FE) mesh can then be easily constructed from these surfaces. Examples
   are given for constructing several 3D-AV geometries by estimating the
   needed parameters from echocardiographic measurements. The average
   distance (error) between the calculated geometry and the 3D-TEE
   measurements was only 0.78 +/- 0.63 mm. The proposed general 3D
   parametric method is very effective in quantitatively representing a
   wide range of native AV structures, with and without pathology. It can
   also facilitate a methodical quantitative investigation over the effect
   of pathology and mechanical loading on these major AV parameters. (C)

Abstract = {{In spite of high piezoelectricity, only a few one-dimensional
   ferroelectric nano-materials with perovskite structure have been used
   for piezoelectric nanogenerator applications. In this paper, we report
   high output electrical signals, i.e. an open-circuit voltage of 3.2 V
   and a closed-circuit current of 67.5 nA (current density 9.3 nA cm(-2))
   at 0.38\% strain and 15.2\% s(-1) strain rate, using randomly aligned
   lead-free KNbO3 ferroelectric nanorods (similar to 1 mu m length) with
   piezoelectric coefficient (d(33) similar to 55 pm V-1). A flexible
   piezoelectric nanogenerator is mainly composed of
   KNbO3-poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) composite sandwiched by Au/Cr-coated
   polymer substrates. We deposit a thin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
   layer between the KNbO3-PDMS composite and the Au/Cr electrode to
   completely prevent dielectric breakdown during electrical poling and to
   significantly reduce leakage current during excessive straining. The
   flexible KNbO3-PDMS composite device shows a nearly
   frequency-independent dielectric constant (similar to 3.2) and low
   dielectric loss (<0.006) for the frequency range of 10(2)-10(5) Hz.
   These results imply that short and randomly aligned ferroelectric
   nanorods can be used for a flexible high output nanogenerator as well as
   high-k capacitor applications by performing electrical poling and
   further optimizing the device structure.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrogen storage mechanism of graphite was studied by measuring the
   electrical resistance change. Graphite was expanded and activated to
   allow for an easy hydrogen molecule approach and to enlarge the
   adsorption sites. A vanadium catalyst was simultaneously introduced on
   the graphite during the activation process. The hydrogen storage
   increased due to the effects of expansion, activation, and the catalyst.
   In addition, the electrical resistance of the prepared samples was
   measured during hydrogen molecule adsorption to investigate the hydrogen
   adsorption mechanism. It was found that the electrical resistance
   changed as a result of the easy hydrogen molecule approach, as well as
   of the adsorption process and the catalyst. It was also notable that the
   catalyst improved not only the hydrogen storage capacity but also the
   speed of hydrogen storage based on the response time. The hydrogen
   storage mechanism is suggested based on the effects of expansion,

Abstract = {{The patterned template-assisted assembly of the cubic microparticles
   driven by the competing capillary, Columbic, and van der Waals forces
   had been studied in comparison with the traditional spherical colloidal
   microparticles. We observed that the spherical and cubic microparticles
   assembled with different probability in the channels of the hydrophobic
   hydrophilic patterned substrates due to differences in a balance of
   adhesive and capillary forces. In contrast to highly selective assembly
   of spherical microparticles, selective deposition of cubic microcrystals
   with channels is impeded by strong adhesive forces facilitated by large
   specific interfacial areas between cube facets and substrate. The
   modification of the patterned substrate by functionalized coatings with
   oppositely charged topmost layers significantly increases the
   probability (to 86\%) of the cubic microparticles to assemble into
   chemically modified channels. The introduction of ultrathin LbL shells
   on cubic microparticles and functionalization of patterned substrates
   are critical for the directed colloidal assembly of anisotropic
   microparticles into ordered aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{One of the outstanding challenges in phononic crystals and acoustic
   metamaterials development is the ability to tune their performance
   without requiring structural modifications. We report on the
   experimental demonstration of a tunable acoustic waveguide implemented
   within a two-dimensional phononic plate. The waveguide is equipped with
   a periodic array of piezoelectric transducers which are shunted through
   passive inductive circuits. The resonance characteristics of the shunts
   lead to strong attenuation and to negative group velocities at
   frequencies defined by the circuits' inductance. The proposed waveguide
   illustrates the concept of a controllable acoustic logic port or of an
   acoustic metamaterial with tunable dispersion characteristics. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline NiFe2O4 (NFO) thin films are grown on (111) platinized
   Si substrates via chemical solution processing. theta-2 theta x-ray
   diffraction, x-ray pole figures and electron diffraction indicate that
   the NFO has a high degree of < 111 > uniaxial texture normal to the film
   plane. The texturing is initiated by nucleation of (111) planes at the
   Pt interface and is enhanced with decreasing film thickness. As the NFO
   magnetic easy-axis is < 111 >, the out-of-plane magnetization exhibits
   improved M-r/M-s and coercivity with respect to randomly oriented films
   on silicon substrates. The out-of-plane M-r/M-s ratio for (111) textured
   NFO thin film is improved from 30\% in 150 nm-thick films to above 70\%
   in 50 nm-thick films. The improved out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy is
   comparable to epitaxial NFO films of comparable thickness deposited by
   pulsed laser deposition and sputtering. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a bidirectional radio over

   multiband signals and upstream data. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first time that the multiband signals, including baseband, 24-GHz
   microwave (MW), and 42- and 60-GHz millimeter-wave (MMW) signals, are
   realized through multicarrier generation and heterodyne mixing
   techniques. The frequencies of the MW and MMW signals are continuously
   tunable, thus high scalability can be achieved. In the base station,
   part of the continuous wave light is used as an optical carrier for
   upstream data, which is transmitted back to the central station though
   the same fiber. Error-free performances are achieved for all the signals
   after 25-km single-mode fiber and 5 ft air link transmission for

Title = {{Transport behavior of functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes in

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{4521-4531}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A series of one-dimensional column experiments was conducted to examine
   the effects of tube length on the transport and deposition of
   4-ethoxybenzoic acid functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
   in water-saturated porous media. Aqueous MWCNTs suspensions were
   prepared to yield three distributions of tube lengths; 0.02-1.3 mu m
   (short), 0.2-7.5 mu m (medium), and 0.2-21.4 mu m (long). Results of the
   column studies showed that MWCNT retention increased with increasing
   tube length. Nevertheless, more than 76\% of the MWCNT mass delivered to
   the columns was detected in effluent samples under all experimental
   conditions, indicating that the functionalized MWCNTs were readily
   transported through 40-50 mesh Ottawa sand. Examination of MWCNT length
   distributions in the effluent samples revealed that nanotubes with
   lengths greater than 8 mu m were preferentially deposited. In addition,
   measured retention profiles exhibited the greatest MWCNT deposition near
   the column inlet, which was most pronounced for the long MWCNTs, and
   decreased sharply with travel distance. Scanning electron microscope
   (SEM) images showed that MWCNTs were deposited on sand surfaces over the
   entire column length, while larger MWCNT bundles were retained at grain
   intersections and near the column inlet. A mathematical model based on
   clean bed filtration theory (CBFT) was unable to accurately simulate the
   measured retention profile data, even after varying the weighting
   function and incorporating a nonuniform attachment rate coefficient
   expression. Modification of the mathematical model to account for
   physical straining greatly improved predictions of MWCNT retention,
   yielding straining rate coefficients that were four orders-of-magnitude
   greater than corresponding attachment rate coefficients. Taken in
   concert, these experimental and modeling results demonstrate the
   potential importance of, and need to consider, particle straining and
   tube length distribution when describing MWCNT transport in
   water-saturated porous media. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We have revised classical micromechanics by accounting for the effect of
   interface to predict the effective anisotropic elastic properties of
   heterogeneous materials containing nano-inhomogeneities. In contrast to
   sharp interface between the matrix and inhomogeneity, we introduce the
   concept of interphase to account for the interfacial-stress effect at
   the nano-scale. The interphase's constitutive properties are derived
   from atomistic simulations and then incorporated in a
   micromechanics-based interphase model to compute effective properties of
   nanocomposites. This scale transition approach bridges the gap between
   discrete atomic level interactions and continuum mechanics. An advantage
   of this approach is that it combines atomistic with continuum models
   that consider inhomogeneity and interphase morphology. It thereby
   enables us to account simultaneously for both the shape and the
   anisotropy of a nano-inhomogeneity and interphase at the continuum level
   when we compute material's overall properties. In so doing, it frees us
   from making any assumptions about the interface characteristics between
   matrix and the nano-inhomogeneity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An effective approach to separating shaped particles is needed to
   isolate disease-causing cells for diagnostics or to aid in purifying
   nonspherical particles in applications ranging from food science to drug
   delivery. However, the separation of shaped particles is generally
   challenging, since nonspherical particles can freely rotate and present
   different faces while being sorted. We experimentally and numerically
   show that inertial fluid-dynamic effects allow for shape-dependent
   separation of flowing particles. (Spheres and rods with aspect ratios of
   3:1 and 5:1 have all been separable.) Particle rotation around a
   conserved axis following Jeffery orbits is found to be a necessary
   component in producing different equilibrium positions across the
   channel that depend on particle rotational diameter. These differences
   are large enough to enable passive, continuous, high-purity,
   high-throughput, and shape-based separation downstream. Furthermore, we
   show that this shape-based separation can be applied to a large range of
   particle sizes and types, including small, artificially made 3-mu m
   particles as well as bioparticles such as yeast. This practical approach
   for sorting particles by a previously inaccessible geometric parameter
   opens up a new capability that should find use in a range of fields.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) have been deposited on carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) from a single source precursor, zinc(II)
   bis(diethyldithiocarbamate), using a one-step batch supercritical carbon
   dioxide (sc-CO2) process. By eliminating the need for an additional
   sulfur source while simultaneously employing CO2 as the solvent, this
   method replaces environmentally unfriendly chemicals commonly used in
   ZnS-CNT nanocomposite synthesis such as ethylene glycol, thiourea, and
   hydrogen sulfide. ZnS NP morphology displayed large clusters (209 +/- 24
   nm) that were comprised of smaller particles (16.9 +/- 1.9 nm).
   Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrated broad band fluorescence of
   the ZnS-CNT nanocomposite at 440 nm (2.82 eV) and fluorescence of a Mn
   doped ZnS-CNT nanocomposite at 445 nm (2.79 eV) and 602 nm (2.07 eV),
   also in agreement with previous studies. The ZnS-CNT nanocomposite was
   compared to ZnS NPs synthesized in the absence of a substrate; results
   indicated that the ZnS-CNT nanocomposite was formed by a heterogeneous
   reaction mechanism in the sc-CO2 system.}},

Abstract = {{A series of higher permeability polyamide imides based on
   2,2'-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride with
   comparable plasticization resistance to Torlon were synthesized and
   formed into dense film membranes. Polymers possessing 2,4-diamino
   mesitylene (DAM) were stable up to 56 atm of pure CO2, which is due to
   enhanced charge transfer complex formation compared to polymers
   containing 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) dianiline (6FpDA) and
   2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (TmPDA). The new polymers
   containing DAM and TmPDA showed ideal CO2/CH4 selectivities of near 50
   with CO2 and H2S permeabilities over an order of magnitude higher than
   Torlon. CO2 and CH4 sorption in the DAM- and TmPDA-based materials was
   reduced, whereas H2S sorption was enhanced relative to membranes
   containing fluorinated 6FpDA. Consequently, DAM- and TmPDA-based
   membranes showed increased stability toward high pressure CO2 but lower
   plasticization resistance toward pure H2S. These results highlight the
   differences between CO2 and H2S that challenge the rational design of
   materials targeting simultaneous separation of both contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Fabricating vertically ordered and etchable high aspect ratio
   nanodomains of block copolymer (BCP) thin films on diverse substrates
   via continuous processing dynamic cold zone annealing (CZA) is
   particularly attractive for nanomanufacturing of next-generation
   electronics. Previously, we reported dynamic CZA studies with a shallow
   thermal gradient (maximum del T similar to 14 degrees C/mm) that
   produced only BCP cylinders oriented parallel to substrate. Here, we
   report a CZA utilizing a dynamic sharp thermal gradient (del T similar
   to 45 degrees C/mm) (i.e., CZA-S). This method allows for production of
   etchable and vertically oriented cylindrical domains of
   poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) in 100-1000 rim thick films on low
   thermal conductivity rigid (quartz) and flexible (PDMS, Kapton)
   substrates. Competing substrate wetting interactions dominate BCP
   orientation in films below 100 nm while broadening of the thermal
   gradient profile in films thicker than 1000 nm leads to loss of vertical
   orientation. An optimal dynamic sweep rate (similar to 5 mu m/s)
   produces the best vertical order. At too fast a sweep rate (>10 mu m/s)
   the BCP film ordering is kinetically hindered, while at too slow a sweep
   rate (<1 mu m/s), polymer relaxation and preferential surface wetting
   dynamics favor parallel BCP orientation. Equivalent static gradient
   conditions produce vertically aligned BCP cylinders only at the maximum
   del T. CZA-S mechanism involves propagating this vertically oriented BCP
   zone across the sample.}},

Title = {{Density ratio effects on reacting bluff-body flow field characteristics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{706}},
Pages = {{219-250}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{The wake characteristics of bluff-body-stabilized flames are a strong
   function of the density ratio across the flame and the relative offset
   between the flame and shear layer. This paper describes systematic
   experimental measurements and stability calculations of the dependence
   of the flow field characteristics and flame sheet dynamics upon flame
   density ratio, rho(u)/rho(b), over the Reynolds number range of
   1000-3300. We show that two fundamentally different flame/flow
   behaviours are observed at high and low rho(u)/rho(b) values: a stable,
   noise-driven fixed point and limit-cycle oscillations, respectively.
   These results are interpreted as a transition from convective to global
   instability and are captured well by stability calculations that used
   the measured velocity and density profiles as inputs. However, in this
   high-Reynolds-number flow, the measurements show that no abrupt
   bifurcation in flow/flame behaviour occurs at a given rho(u)/rho(b)
   value. Rather, the flow field is highly intermittent in a transitional
   rho(u)/rho(b) range, with the relative fraction of the two different
   flow/flame behaviours monotonically varying with rho(u)/rho(b). This
   intermittent behaviour is a result of parametric excitation of the
   global mode growth rate in the vicinity of a supercritical Hopf
   bifurcation. It is shown that this parametric excitation is due to
   random fluctuations in relative locations of the flame and shear layer.}},

Abstract = {{We have synthesized a series of ethynylated phenazines and their
   bis-triazolyl cycloadducts to serve as metal ion sensors. Binding of
   metal ions is achieved through coordination to the phenazine nitrogen
   atom and the triazole ring. To allow metal sensing in aqueous solution,
   the triazole units are substituted with water-soluble ethylene glycol
   chains. These phenazine cycloadducts exhibit a selective affinity for
   binding silver ions. Examination of the halogenated analogues reveals a
   lowering of the band gap and the corresponding bathochromic shifts in
   the absorption and emission spectra. The electron-withdrawing properties
   of these halogens also result in significantly decreased metal-binding
   activity of the phenazine cycloadducts.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This Letter describes the synthesis and photophysical characterization
   of a Ru(II) assembly consisting of metal polypyridyl complexes linked
   together by a polyfluorene scaffold. Unlike many scaffolds incorporating
   saturated linkages, the conjugated polymer in this system acts as a
   functional light-harvesting component. Conformational disorder breaks
   the conjugation in the polymer backbone, resulting in a chain composed
   of many chromophore units, whose relative energies depend on the segment
   lengths. Photoexcitation of the polyfluorene by a femtosecond laser
   pulse results in the excitation of polyfluorene, which then undergoes
   direct energy transfer to the pendant Ru(II) complexes, producing
   Ru(II){*} excited states within 500 fs after photoexcitation.
   Femtosecond transient absorption data show the presence of electron
   transfer from PF{*} to Ru(II) to form charge-separated (CS) products
   within 1-2 ps. The decay of the oxidized and reduced products, PF+center
   dot and Ru(I), through back electron transfer are followed using
   picosecond transient absorption methods.}},

Abstract = {{The D/H isotope effect for the CH-pi interaction was studied
   experimentally and computationally. First, a series of molecular
   balances that are very sensitive to changes in the strength of the CH-pi
   interactions in solution were designed. Balances with deuterated and
   non-deuterated alkyl groups were synthesized, and their intramolecular
   CH-pi interactions were compared. The geometries of their intramolecular
   CH-pi and CD-pi interactions were characterized in the solid state by
   X-ray analysis, and the strength of each interaction was characterized
   in solution by the folded/unfolded ratio as measured by H-1 NMR spectra.
   Second, the relative strengths of the CH-pi and CD-pi interactions were
   also assessed computationally using dispersion-corrected DFT
   (PDE-D2/6-31+G{*}). No significant differencee was observed in either
   the experimental or theoretical studies, indicating that the D/H isotope
   effect for the CH-pi interaction is either very small or nonexistent.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental principle of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics were
   introduced by Wang in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Due to the
   polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry in
   materials such as the wurtzite structured ZnO, GaN and InN, a
   piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by
   applying a stress. Owing to the simultaneous possession of
   piezoelectricity and semiconductor properties, the piezopotential
   created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport at
   the interface/junction. Piezotronics is about the devices fabricated
   using the piezopotential as a gate voltage to tune/control charge
   carrier transport at a contact or junction. The piezo-phototronic effect
   is to use the piezopotential to control the carrier generation,
   transport, separation and/or recombination for improving the performance
   of optoelectronic devices, such as photon detector, solar cell and LED.
   This manuscript reviews the updated progress in the two new fields. A
   perspective is given about their potential applications in sensors,
   human-silicon technology interfacing, MEMS, nanorobotics and energy
   sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Two different types of inverted top-emitting blue electrophosphorescent
   organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are demonstrated that differ only
   in the choice of high electron mobility transport layers. The electron
   transport layer consists of either 1,3,5-tri(p-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)
   benzene (TpPyPB) or 1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene) (TmPyPB).
   Devices with TpPyPB exhibit a current efficacy of 5.1 cd/A at 1259
   cd/m(2). OLEDs with TmPyPB show higher performance with a current
   efficacy of 33.6 cd/A at 1126 cd/m(2). The difference in performance of
   OLEDs with TmPyPB is due to a combination of TmPyPB's higher triplet
   energy that decreases exciton transfer to the ETL and altered charge
   balance. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Despite theoretical predictions, the question of room-temperature
   magnetic order in graphene must be conclusively resolved before graphene
   can fully achieve its potential as a spintronic medium. Through scanning
   tunneling microscopy (STM) and point I-V measurements, the current study
   reveals that unlike pristine samples, graphene nanostructures, when
   functionalized with aryl radicals, can sustain magnetic order. STM
   images show 1-D and 2-D periodic super-lattices originating from the
   functionalization of a single sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene
   structure. Field-dependent super-lattices in 3-nm wide ``zigzag{''}
   nanoribbons indicate local moments with parallel and anti-parallel
   ordering along and across the edges, respectively. Anti-parallel
   ordering is observed in 2-D segments with sizes of over 20 nm. The field
   dependence of STM images and point I-V curves indicates a spin polarized
   local density of states (LDOS), an out-of-plane anisotropy field of less
   than 10 Oe, and an exchange coupling field of 100 Oe at room
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Precast, prestressed concrete bridge girders have become longer,
   increasing the likelihood of a stability failure. Understanding the
   stability behavior of prestressed concrete bridge girders on flexible
   supports entails the consideration of the deformation of the girder, the

   the rotational stiffness provided by the bearing pads. An experimental
   study on the rollover behavior of a 100 ft long (30 m) PCI BT-54
   prestressed concrete bridge girder was performed. Qualitative
   conclusions were derived from the experiments, and a comparison was made
   to a nonlinear analysis and to the current method for calculating factor
   of safety against rollover. The experimental and analytical study showed
   a high sensitivity to the end support conditions. Recommendations were

Title = {{A Semantic Association Hardware Acceleration System for Integrated
   Product Data Management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Many modern products are complex systems comprised of highly integrated
   mechanical, electrical, electronic, and software components, which are
   commonly known as mechatronic systems. Similarly, product data and
   life-cycle management systems that support the engineering and design of
   mechatronic systems are becoming complex and need to store, retrieve,
   and process vast amounts of files associated with mechatronic products.
   For many years, software developers and computer architects have
   benefited by continuous increases in computational performance, as
   predicted by Moore's law. However, issues such as extreme power
   consumption have begun to limit certain types of performance increases
   such as hardware clock rates. In an effort to find new ways to increase
   computational performance, engineers and computer scientists have been
   investigating new techniques such as hardware acceleration systems,
   reconfigurable computing, and heterogeneous computing (HC). In light of
   these emerging computational paradigms, this paper introduces a semantic
   association hardware acceleration system for integrated product data
   management (PDM) based on semantic file systems. The concept of semantic
   path merger (SPM) is described along with a discussion of its
   realization as a hardware-based associative memory for accelerated
   semantic file retrieval. The energy and retrieval performance metrics of
   the proposed hardware system is given along with its comparative
   analysis with the industry standard content addressable memory (CAM).
   The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the state-of-art for the
   field of heterogeneous computing within the scope of computational
   platforms for design and engineering applications. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The ionic liquid butylmethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (bmim)(PF6)
   and five different hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants were investigated as
   the working fluid pairs for a waste-heat driven absorption heat pump
   system for possible applications in electronics thermal management. A
   significant amount of the energy consumed in large electronic systems is
   used for cooling, resulting in low grade waste heat, which can be used
   to drive an absorption refrigeration system if a suitable working fluids
   can be identified. The Redlich-Kwong-type equation of state was used to
   model the thermodynamic conditions and the binary mixture properties at
   the corresponding states. The effects of desorber and absorber
   temperatures, waste-heat quality, and system design on the heat pump
   performance were investigated. Supporting experiments using
   R134a/(bmim)(PF6) as the working fluid pair were performed. Desorber and
   absorber outlet temperatures were varied by adjusting the desorber
   supply power and the coolant temperature at the evaporator inlet,
   respectively. For an evaporator temperature of 41 degrees C, which is
   relevant to electronics cooling applications, the maximum
   cooling-to-total-energy input was 0.35 with the evaporator cooling
   capability of 36W and the desorber outlet temperature in the range of 50

Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix have recently been
   shown to promote myofibroblast differentiation and lung fibrosis.
   Mechanisms by which matrix stiffness regulates myofibroblast
   differentiation are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to
   determine the intrinsic mechanisms of mechanotransduction in the
   regulation of matrix stiffness-induced myofibroblast differentiation. A
   well established polyacrylamide gel system with tunable substrate
   stiffness was used in this study. Megakaryoblastic leukemia factor-1
   (MKL1) nuclear translocation was imaged by confocal immunofluorescent
   microscopy. The binding of MKL1 to the alpha-smooth muscle actin
   (alpha-SMA) gene promoter was quantified by quantitative chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assay. Normal human lung fibroblasts responded to
   matrix stiffening with changes in actin dynamics that favor filamentous
   actin polymerization. Actin polymerization resulted in nuclear
   translocation of MKL1, a serum response factor coactivator that plays a
   central role in regulating the expression of fibrotic genes, including
   alpha-SMA, a marker for myofibroblast differentiation. Mouse lung
   fibroblasts deficient in Mkl1 did not respond to matrix stiffening with
   increased alpha-SMA expression, whereas ectopic expression of human MKL1
   cDNA restored the ability of Mkl1 null lung fibroblasts to express
   alpha-SMA. Furthermore, matrix stiffening promoted production and
   activation of the small GTPase RhoA, increased Rho kinase (ROCK)
   activity, and enhanced fibroblast contractility. Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK
   abrogated stiff matrix-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization, MKL1
   nuclear translocation, and myofibroblast differentiation. This study
   indicates that actin cytoskeletal remodeling-mediated activation of MKL1
   transduces mechanical stimuli from the extracellular matrix to a
   fibrogenic program that promotes myofibroblast differentiation,
   suggesting an intrinsic mechanotransduction mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A global point mascon model for the geopotential is proposed that is
   memory light to execute, simple to implement (at any derivative level),
   and is naturally amenable to parallelism. In contrast, conventional
   high-fidelity geopotential calculation using spherical harmonics is
   expensive, cumbersome to implement, and relies on recursive nonparallel
   relations. To solve for the global point mascon model, the gravity
   inversion problem is posed classically as a large and dense
   least-squares estimation problem. The well-known ill-conditioned nature
   of the inversion is overcome in part using orthogonal solution methods,
   a judicious choice for the mascon distribution, and numerically
   preferred summation techniques. A variety of resolutions are examined
   including global point mascon models with up to 30,720 mascons.
   Measurements are simulated using truncated spherical harmonics
   evaluations from the GGM02C gravity field derived from the GRACE
   spacecraft. Resolutions are chosen to target residual levels at least an
   order of magnitude smaller than the published expected errors of the
   GGM02C. A single central processing unit Fortran implementation is found
   to be approximately equal in speed when compared with spherical
   harmonics for all resolutions, whereas a parallel implementation on an
   inexpensive graphics processing unit leads to an order of magnitude
   speedup in the case of a 156 x 156 gravity field. In addition, the
   global point mascon model is found to be particularly attractive for
   MATLAB users due to MATLAB's efficient use of large matrix operations.}},

Abstract = {{Precast structural concrete beams have become longer and more slender,
   increasing the likelihood of a stability failure. Although there are
   methods to determine the lateral-torsional buckling load for reinforced
   and prestressed concrete beams, there has been no conformity as to which
   is the more accurate method, nor do they account for initial
   imperfections. Six slender, rectangular pretensioned concrete beams were
   tested and showed that the lateral-torsional stability behavior was
   similar to that of reinforced concrete beams except for (1) changes in
   material properties owing to a different stress state and (2) the
   effects of prestressing on the cracking behavior of the cross section.
   The stability behavior proved to be sensitive to initial imperfections;
   therefore, both a geometric nonlinear stability analysis and a
   simplified equation were developed. The predictive methods were compared
   with the current and past results, and the analytical methods showed
   good correlation with all structural concrete experimental results. The
   results indicate that prestressed concrete beams are susceptible to
   lateral-torsional buckling and the initial imperfections serve to reduce
   the buckling load owing to nonlinear geometric behavior and a
   nonrectangular compression zone. DOI:

Abstract = {{A generalized framework is presented for the electromechanical modeling
   of base-excited piezoelectric energy harvesters with symmetric and

   for an independent axial displacement variable and its electromechanical
   coupling in all cases. Comparisons are provided against the analytical
   solution for symmetric laminates and convergence of the assumed-modes
   solution to the analytical solution with increasing number of modes is
   shown. Model validations are also presented by comparing the
   electromechanical frequency response functions derived herein with the
   experimentally obtained ones in the absence and presence of a tip mass
   attachment. A discussion is provided for combination of the
   assumed-modes solution with nonlinear energy harvesting and storage
   circuitry. The electromechanical assumed-modes formulations can be used

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging tasks of a construction project planner is
   to simultaneously minimize the total project cost and total project
   duration while considering issues related to optimal resource allocation
   and resource leveling. Therefore, project planners face complicated
   multivariate, time-cost-resource optimization (TCRO) problems that
   require time-cost-resource tradeoff analysis. The hybrid GA-PSO approach
   is presented to solve complex, TCRO problems in construction project
   planning. The proposed approach uses the fuzzy set theory to
   characterize uncertainty about the input data (i.e., time, cost, and
   resources required to perform an activity) in this hybrid approach. The
   proposed fuzzy-enabled hybrid GA-PSO approach is applied to solve two
   optimization problems that are found in the construction project
   planning literature. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy enabled hybrid
   GA-PSO approach is superior to existing optimization algorithms at
   finding better project schedule solutions with less total project cost,
   less total project duration, and less total variation in resource
   allocation. The results also show that the proposed approach is faster
   than existing methods in processing time for solving complex TCRO
   problems in construction project planning. DOI:

Abstract = {{Consider a network N = (N, A) and associate with each arc e is an
   element of A a fixed cost c(e) for using arc e, an interval {[}l(e),
   u(e)] (l(e), u(e) is an element of Z) specifying the range of allowable
   resource consumption quantities along arc e, and a per-unit cost (c)
   over bar (e) for resource consumed along e. Furthermore, for each node n
   is an element of N, let U-n is an element of N be the maximum amount of
   resource consumption a path can accumulate before visiting node n. Given
   a source node n(s) is an element of N and sink node n(t) is an element
   of N, the fixed-charge shortest-path problem (FCSPP) seeks to find a
   minimum-cost-feasible path from n(s) to n(t). When resource consumption
   is simply additive, the resource-constrained shortest-path problem
   (RCSPP) is a special case of FCSPP. We develop a new dynamic programming
   algorithm for FCSPP. The algorithm uses solutions from labeling and
   dominance techniques for standard RCSPPs on slightly modified problems,
   and it combines these solutions by exploiting the structure provided by
   certain classes of knapsack problems to efficiently construct an optimal
   solution to FCSPP. Computational experiments demonstrate that our
   algorithm is often several orders of magnitude faster than naive dynamic
   programming procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer and the second leading
   cause of cancer death in U.S. women. Although mammography is the most
   effective modality for breast cancer screening, it has several potential
   risks, including high false-positive rates. Therefore, the balance of
   benefits and risks, which depend on personal characteristics, is
   critical in designing a mammography screening schedule. In contrast to
   prior research and existing guidelines that consider population-based
   screening recommendations, we propose a personalized mammography
   screening policy based on the prior screening history and personal risk
   characteristics of women. We formulate a finite-horizon, partially
   observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for this problem. Our
   POMDP model incorporates two methods of detection (self or screen),
   age-specific unobservable disease progression, and age-specific
   mammography test characteristics. We solve this POMDP optimally after
   setting transition probabilities to values estimated from a validated
   microsimulation model. Additional published data is used to specify
   other model inputs such as sensitivity and specificity of test results.
   Our results show that our proposed personalized screening schedules
   outperform the existing guidelines with respect to the total expected
   quality-adjusted life years, while significantly decreasing the number
   of mammograms and false-positives. We also report the lifetime risk of
   developing undetected invasive cancer associated with each screening
   scenario.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{9-15}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pigmented nonimpact (inkjet) printing is a concern in conventional
   flotation deinking, due to the problems associated with the hydrophilic,
   submicron-size pigment particles of the ink. Preliminary experiments
   were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of a conventional flotation
   deinking process in detaching those inkjet particles from the fiber
   surfaces and network. A Denver D-12 laboratory flotation cell was used
   to test 100\% old newsprint paper (ONP) with the ISO brightness target
   set to 58, which makes a paper recyclable. The inkjet-printed ONP was
   floated to 47 ISO brightness by the INGEDE Method 11. It was enhanced to
   50 ISO brightness using flotation, with the addition of nonionic
   surfactant for better repulping. In addition, a patented electric field
   technology was used for further improving the floated ISO brightness to
   52.5-yet still short of the 58 target for recycling. This improvement
   was reached with small air bubble sizes, which are more likely to
   collide and interact with ink particles, causing additional ink to be
   brought up to the surface of the water pool. The increasing problem of
   deinkability from digital nonimpact inkjet printing means that
   additional technical efforts are needed to overcome the crossroad
   between environmental concerns and technological progress. Papermills,
   inkjet suppliers, printer manufacturers, and academic and industrial
   deinkers should take collective action to meet the challenges to future
   success.}},

Abstract = {{Inductive coupling is a viable scheme to wirelessly energize devices
   with a wide range of power requirements from nanowatts in radio
   frequency identification tags to milliwatts in implantable
   microelectronic devices, watts in mobile electronics, and kilowatts in
   electric cars. Several analytical methods for estimating the power
   transfer efficiency (PTE) across inductive power transmission links have
   been devised based on circuit and electromagnetic theories by electrical
   engineers and physicists, respectively. However, a direct side-by-side
   comparison between these two approaches is lacking. Here, we have
   analyzed the PTE of a pair of capacitively loaded inductors via
   reflected load theory (RLT) and compared it with a method known as
   coupled-mode theory (CMT). We have also derived PTE equations for
   multiple capacitively loaded inductors based on both RLT and CMT. We
   have proven that both methods basically result in the same set of
   equations in steady state and either method can be applied for short- or
   midrange coupling conditions. We have verified the accuracy of both
   methods through measurements, and also analyzed the transient response
   of a pair of capacitively loaded inductors. Our analysis shows that the
   CMT is only applicable to coils with high quality factor (Q) and large
   coupling distance. It simplifies the analysis by reducing the order of
   the differential equations by half compared to the circuit theory.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic biomarkers are essential for understanding the underlying
   molecular basis of human diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In
   this review, we describe a biomarker identification pipeline for
   cardiovascular disease, which includes 1) high-throughput genomic data
   acquisition, 2) preprocessing and normalization of data, 3) exploratory
   analysis, 4) feature selection, 5) classification, and 6) interpretation
   and validation of candidate biomarkers. We review each step in the
   pipeline, presenting current and widely used bioinformatics methods.
   Furthermore, we analyze several publicly available cardiovascular
   genomics datasets to illustrate the pipeline. Finally, we summarize the
   current challenges and opportunities for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Seismocardiography (SCG), a representation of mechanical heart motion,
   may more accurately determine periods of cardiac quiescence within a
   cardiac cycle than the electrically derived electrocardiogram (EKG) and,
   thus, may have implications for gating in cardiac computed tomography.
   We designed and implemented a system to synchronously acquire
   echocardiography, EKG, and SCG data. The device was used to study the
   variability between EKG and SCG and characterize the relationship
   between the mechanical and electrical activity of the heart. For each
   cardiac cycle, the feature of the SCG indicating Aortic Valve Closure
   was identified and its time position with respect to the EKG was
   observed. This position was found to vary for different heart rates and
   between two human subjects. A color map showing the magnitude of the SCG
   acceleration and computed velocity was derived, allowing for direct
   visualization of quiescent phases of the cardiac cycle with respect to
   heart rate.}},

Title = {{CO2 sorption and desorption performance of thermally cycled hollow fiber
   sorbents}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{285-294}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We describe here the CO2 sorption and desorption properties of hollow
   fiber sorbents-a polymer/zeolite hybrid sorbent that possesses a coated
   bore that allows for exceedingly fast heat transfer between the heat
   transfer fluid and the sorbent. The fiber sorbents are intended for use
   in post-combustion CO2. The fiber sorption properties are tested
   chromatographically with simulated flue gas in the absence of a heat
   transfer fluid and are found via in situ thermal measurements to be
   highly non-isothermal, which results in up to 40\% losses in CO2
   breakthrough capacities. The thermal front moving through the fiber wall
   was found to progress approximately 30\% faster than the propagating
   speed of the CO2 sorption front. Upon the addition of a heat transfer
   fluid (water) in the bores of the fibers, breakthrough CO2 capacities
   were maintained at all flue gas superficial velocities studied (up to 50
   cm/s). The propagation speed of the CO2 front was reduced by 38\% by the
   addition of cooling water in the bores, and the in situ thermal
   measurements revealed that the fiber sorbents were nearly isothermal
   during the CO2 sorption step. One of the main conceptual advantages of a
   fiber sorbent CO2 capture platform is the ability to transfer the
   released sorption enthalpy to the bore-side cooling water, which can
   then be later used in a beneficial way. By varying the cooling water
   velocity, in situ thermal measurements showed that 22,000J per mol of
   flowing CO2 could be transferred to the cooling water out of a possible
   36,000J per mol. Finally, plug flow-mode desorption experiments were
   performed, and a 40.5 mol\% CO2 product was obtained. The small scales
   of the system prohibit sharper thermal fronts, which likely causes
   unwanted product CO2 and interstitial N-2 mixing. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{351-362}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Caprocks with significant clay content are candidate seal layers for CO2
   geological storage. Changes in electrical and capillary forces are
   expected when CO2 invades the water saturated pore space. Sedimentation
   experiments conducted to explore the response of kaolinite and
   montmorillonite to deionized water, brine, heptane, liquid CO2 and
   supercritical CO2 show that both montmorillonite and kaolinite aggregate
   when submerged in CO2 and the final porosity in CO2 is smaller than in
   brine. Differences in dielectric properties between CO2 and water, and
   ensuing implications on van der Waals attraction and double layer
   repulsion explain the observed phenomena. On the other hand, capillary
   effects induced by the water-CO2 interface are corroborated by
   clay-water paste desiccation experiments conducted using supercritical
   CO2 : water dissolution into the surrounding CO2 causes suction and
   capillary contraction, the invasion of the CO2-water interface into the
   sediment, and the formation of desiccation cracks. Volume contraction
   and crack initiation are consistent with the sediment response within an
   effective stress framework. Altered electrical forces and emergent
   capillary forces lead to coupled chemo-hydromechanical phenomena in seal
   layers that could facilitate CO2 breakthrough and advection through high
   porosity caprocks; related phenomena are identified in the reservoir
   rock. Additional studies are needed to further assess coupled phenomena
   when the interparticle distance is a few monolayers of water. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Current autonomous parafoil and payload aircraft are controlled by
   deflection of the canopy trailing edge. Asymmetric trailing edge
   deflection results in a turn, symmetric deflection results in a change
   in speed with little change in glide slope. The inability to control
   glide slope with these traditional canopy control mechanisms is severely
   detrimental to the landing accuracy of parafoil and payload aircraft,
   especially when turbulent atmospheric conditions or difficult terrain
   are present near the landing area. An alternative canopy control
   mechanism is investigated where internal air is vented through the upper
   surface of the canopy to create an aerodynamic spoiler. Flight-test
   results for various configurations of the spoiler concept are presented.
   It is shown that a dramatic change in glide slope can be generated with
   relatively small spoiler actuations. Furthermore, it is shown that the
   same lateral control authority available with trailing edge brakes can
   be achieved with asymmetric actuation of the upper-surface spoilers.}},

Abstract = {{To prepare for its new Dolphin Tales exhibit, Georgia Aquarium partnered
   with Georgia Institute of Technology to design the exhibit's guest
   movement with the goal of enhancing the guest experience while limiting
   congestion. The result was the development and application of the
   RealOpt-ABM (c) simulation decision support system for complex modeling
   and optimization.
   This work advanced the knowledge frontier in analytical methods in three
   ways. First, we developed a powerful heuristic algorithm for finding
   good feasible solutions for intractable nonlinear mixed-integer program
   resource allocation instances. Second, we integrated simulation and
   optimization technology into a unified software framework for realistic
   modeling of large-scale applications with human cognitive and behavioral
   elements; the software assists in optimizing overall operational
   dynamics. Third, we developed software for automatically interpreting
   computer-rendered drawings of processes and tasks into system process
   maps for simulation and optimization; as advanced visualization becomes
   more common, automatic translation from mouse clicks and keystrokes to
   an analytic workflow model serves as an important facilitator in
   human-computer interfaces.
   The system provided recommendations that were implemented for strategic
   and operational planning of the exhibit. These recommendations resulted
   in reduced congestion, enhanced guest experience, lower operating costs,
   improved wellness of the dolphins, and better performance in operational
   logistics, efficiency, and show schedules. The total dollar value of
   improvements from using the decision support system in reducing the
   number of shows by one show per week was estimated to be at least \$1.5
   million per year.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers minimax and adaptive prediction with functional
   predictors in the framework of functional linear model and reproducing
   kernel Hilbert space. Minimax rate of convergence for the excess
   prediction risk is established. It is shown that the optimal rate is
   determined jointly by the reproducing kernel and the covariance kernel.
   In particular, the alignment of these two kernels can significantly
   affect the difficulty of the prediction problem. In contrast, the
   existing literature has so far focused only on the setting where the two
   kernels are nearly perfectly aligned. This motivates us to propose an
   easily implementable data-driven roughness regularization predictor that
   is shown to attain the optimal rate of convergence adaptively without
   the need of knowing the covariance kernel. Simulation studies are
   carried out to illustrate the merits of the adaptive predictor and to
   demonstrate the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of minimum-fuel, time-fixed, low-thrust rendezvous is
   addressed with the particular aim of developing a solver to determine
   optimal low-thrust peer-to-peer (P2P) maneuvers, which will be an
   integral part of distributed low-thrust servicing missions for multiple
   satellites. We derive the necessary conditions of optimality for P2P
   refueling maneuvers in a circular planar constellation subject to a
   two-body gravity field. We develop the solver based on an indirect
   optimization technique and use the well-known shooting method to solve
   the two-point boundary value problems associated with the forward and
   return trips or a P2P maneuver. The solver is formulated to consider
   implicitly the n thrust-arc case without requiring a predetermined
   thrust structure. The complete P2P refueling decision simulation
   requires the solution to many nonlinear programming subproblems and,
   therefore, benefits from the fast indirect formulation. The application
   of the tool in the determination of optimal P2P maneuvers required for a
   low-thrust P2P mission for multiple satellites moving in a circular
   orbit is demonstrated. Finally, the paper demonstrates, via numerical
   examples, the benefits of a low-thrust P2P mission compared with the
   impulsive case.}},

Title = {{Four-dimensional cone beam CT reconstruction and enhancement using a
   temporal nonlocal means method}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{5592-5602}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Four-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (4D-CBCT) has
   been developed to provide respiratory phase-resolved volumetric imaging
   in image guided radiation therapy. Conventionally, it is reconstructed
   by first sorting the x-ray projections into multiple respiratory phase
   bins according to a breathing signal extracted either from the
   projection images or some external surrogates, and then reconstructing a
   3D CBCT image in each phase bin independently using FDK algorithm. This
   method requires adequate number of projections for each phase, which can
   be achieved using a low gantry rotation or multiple gantry rotations.
   Inadequate number of projections in each phase bin results in low
   quality 4D-CBCT images with obvious streaking artifacts. 4D-CBCT images
   at different breathing phases share a lot of redundant information,
   because they represent the same anatomy captured at slightly different
   temporal points. Taking this redundancy along the temporal dimension
   into account can in principle facilitate the reconstruction in the
   situation of inadequate number of projection images. In this work, the
   authors propose two novel 4D-CBCT algorithms: an iterative
   reconstruction algorithm and an enhancement algorithm, utilizing a
   temporal nonlocal means (TNLM) method.
   Methods: The authors define a TNLM energy term for a given set of
   4D-CBCT images. Minimization of this term favors those 4D-CBCT images
   such that any anatomical features at one spatial point at one phase can
   be found in a nearby spatial point at neighboring phases. 4D-CBCT
   reconstruction is achieved by minimizing a total energy containing a
   data fidelity term and the TNLM energy term. As for the image
   enhancement, 4D-CBCT images generated by the FDK algorithm are enhanced
   by minimizing the TNLM function while keeping the enhanced images close
   to the FDK results. A forward backward splitting algorithm and a
   Gauss-Jacobi iteration method are employed to solve the problems. The
   algorithms implementation on GPU is designed to avoid redundant and
   uncoalesced memory access, in order to ensure a high computational
   efficiency. Our algorithms have been tested on a digital NURBS-based
   cardiac-torso phantom and a clinical patient case.
   Results: The reconstruction algorithm and the enhancement algorithm
   generate visually similar 4D-CBCT images, both better than the FDK
   results. Quantitative evaluations indicate that, compared with the FDK
   results, our reconstruction method improves contrast-to-noise-ratio
   (CNR) by a factor of 2.56-3.13 and our enhancement method increases the
   CNR by 2.75-3.33 times. The enhancement method also removes over 80\% of
   the streak artifacts from the FDK results. The total computation time is
   509-683 s for the reconstruction algorithm and 524-540 s for the
   enhancement algorithm on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card.
   Conclusions: By innovatively taking the temporal redundancy among
   4D-CBCT images into consideration, the proposed algorithms can produce
   high quality 4D-CBCT images with much less streak artifacts than the FDK
   results, in the situation of inadequate number of projections. (c) 2012

   using the device to touch a heat source, the output voltage linearly
   increases with an increasing rate of change in temperature. The response
   time and reset time of the fabricated sensor are about 0.9 and 3 s,
   respectively. The minimum detecting limit of the change in temperature
   is about 0.4 K at room temperature. The sensor can be used to detect the
   temperature of a finger tip. The electricity generated under a large

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00829.2011.-The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a
   common congenital malformation of the aortic valve (AV) affecting 1\% to
   2\% of the population. The BAV is predisposed to early degenerative
   calcification of valve leaflets, and BAV patients constitute 50\% of AV
   stenosis patients. Although evidence shows that genetic defects can play
   a role in calcification of the BAV leaflets, we hypothesize that drastic
   changes in the mechanical environment of the BAV elicit pathological
   responses from the valve and might be concurrently responsible for early
   calcification. An in vitro model of the BAV was constructed by
   surgically manipulating a native trileaflet porcine AV. The BAV valve
   model and a trileaflet AV (TAV) model were tested in an in vitro
   pulsatile flow loop mimicking physiological hemodynamics. Laser Doppler
   velocimetry was used to make measurements of fluid shear stresses on the
   leaflet of the valve models using previously established methodologies.
   Furthermore, particle image velocimetry was used to visualize the flow
   fields downstream of the valves and in the sinuses. In the BAV model,
   flow near the leaflets and fluid shear stresses on the leaflets were
   much more unsteady than for the TAV model, most likely due to the
   moderate stenosis in the BAV and the skewed forward flow jet that
   collided with the aorta wall. This additional unsteadiness occurred
   during mid- to late-systole and was composed of cycle-to-cycle magnitude
   variability as well as high-frequency fluctuations about the mean shear
   stress. It has been demonstrated that the BAV geometry can lead to
   unsteady shear stresses under physiological flow and pressure
   conditions. Such altered shear stresses could play a role in accelerated
   calcification in BAVs.}},

Abstract = {{In many manufacturing environments, costly job inspection provides
   information about the random deterioration of the machines. The
   resulting maintenance and inspection problem is extensively studied for
   a single machine system by using the framework of Partially Observable
   Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). In this work, this concept is
   extended to multiple operations and multiple job types by considering
   two process flow topologies: (i) re-entrant flow, (ii) hybrid flow. The
   resulting (significantly large sized) POMDPs are solved using a point
   based method called PERSEUS, and the results are compared with those
   obtained by conventionally used periodic policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier
