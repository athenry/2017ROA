Abstract = {{In recent years, our research group has formulated a new framework
   called materials knowledge systems (MKS) for establishing highly
   accurate reduced-order (surrogate) models for localization (opposite of
   homogenization) linkages in hierarchical materials systems. These new
   computationally efficient linkages are designed to capture accurately
   the microscale spatial distribution of a response field of interest in
   the representative volume element (RYE) of a material, when subjected to
   an imposed macroscale loading condition. In prior work, the viability
   and computational advantages of the MKS approach were demonstrated in a
   number of case studies involving multiphase composites, where the local
   material state in each spatial bin of the RYE was permitted to be any
   one of a limited number of material phases (i.e. restricted to a set of
   discrete local states of the material). In this paper, we present a
   major extension to the MKS framework that allows a computationally
   efficient treatment of a significantly more complex local state of the
   material, i.e. crystal lattice orientation. This extension of the MKS
   framework is formulated by the use of suitable Fourier representation of
   the influence functions. This paper describes this new formulation and
   the associated calibration protocols, and demonstrates its viability
   with case studies comprising low and moderate contrast cubic and
   hexagonal polycrystals. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{A series of analytical models have been developed to predict the
   penetration depth during slot die coating on porous media. Analytical
   models for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids were derived based on
   Lubrication Theory, Darcy's law, and a modified Blake-Kozeny equation.
   Using these models, the penetration depth can be quickly solved and the
   effects of material properties and processing conditions on penetration
   depth can be easily investigated. Experiments of coating Newtonian
   glycerin and non-Newtonian blackstrap molasses onto Toray series carbon
   paper were conducted to validate developed models. The overall relative
   error between the predicted and measured penetration depth was found to
   be typically lower than 20\%, which demonstrates the relative accuracy
   of developed models. Furthermore, based on a parametric study, it was
   found that the effect of capillary pressure on penetration depth is less
   than 10\% when the ratio of coating bead pressure and capillary pressure
   is larger than 10. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{Dosing chemotherapy based on pharmacokinetics (PK) instead of body
   surface area (BSA) has been shown to decrease interindividual
   variability in drug exposure. PK-guided 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) instead of
   BSA-guided 5-FU for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
   leads to decreased toxicity and increased overall survival (OS). In this
   article, we use Markov modeling to show that this is a cost-effective
   strategy, costing \$23,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
   Background: Dosing chemotherapy based on BSA results in marked
   interindividual variability in drug exposure. A randomized trial showed
   increased OS and decreased toxicity with PK-guided compared with
   BSA-based 5-FU dosing in patients with mCRC. The objective of this study
   was to compare the cost effectiveness of PK-based 5-FU dosing with
   BSA-based 5-FU dosing in patients with mCRC receiving FOLFOX (5-FU,
   leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). Materials and Methods: We developed a
   Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of PK FOLFOX compared
   with BSA FOLFOX. Progression risks and cause-specific mortality were
   extrapolated from the fitted survival models. Costs for administration
   and management of adverse events were estimated based on 2013 Medicare
   reimbursement rates and average sale prices. Results: PK FOLFOX provided
   2.03 QALYs at a cost of \$50,205 compared with BSA FOLFOX, which
   provided 1.46 QALYs at a cost of \$37,173. The incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was \$22,695 per QALY. The ICER remained
   < \$50,000 per QALY in all univariate and multivariate sensitivity
   analyses. Conclusion: At a \$50,000 per QALY threshold, PK FOLFOX is
   cost effective for mCRC. Because of the cost effectiveness profile and
   OS advantage with PK FOLFOX, it should be evaluated further in
   comparative effectiveness studies.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical framework is established to study the effect of flow
   strain rate on counterflow diffusion flames for general fluids over the
   entire thermodynamic regime. The formulation accommodates fundamental
   thermodynamics and transport theories, along with detailed chemical
   mechanisms. Both steady and unsteady burning branches of a complete
   flame-response curve (the S-curve) are considered. An improved two-point
   flame-controlling continuation method is employed to solve the
   singularity problem at the turning points on the S-curve. As a specific
   example, oxygen/hydrogen flames are systematically investigated over a
   pressure range of 0.5-200 atm. The strain rate is varied from 10(2) to
   10(8) s(-1). Two different inlet temperatures for oxygen (120 and 300 K)
   and hydrogen (20 and 300 K) are treated to explore flame behaviors at
   the ideal-gas and cryogenic-liquid states. General flame similarities
   (in terms of flame temperature, flame thickness, species concentrations,
   reaction rates, and heat release rate) are developed in a normalized
   strain-rate space (a/a(ext)) for the entire range of pressures under
   consideration. Quantitative mapping of flame properties from one
   pressure to another is obtained. In addition, an analytical model is
   developed to refine and elucidate a previously established relationship
   between the heat release rate and pressure and strain rate in the form
   of (q) over dot similar to p(0.534) root a. The heat release rate, when
   normalized with respect to p(0.534) root a(ext), correlates well with
   the normalized strain rate (a/a(ext)). Both numerical and analytical
   results show that the extinction strain rate is approximately
   proportional to pressure; this allows for a priori mapping of flame
   solutions between different pressure conditions. This in turn will
   significantly improve the computational efficiency of combustion
   modeling using tabulated chemistry, including the flamelet, FGM, and FPI
   models. Cryogenic inlet temperature affects only the flame location,
   without discernibly modifying the flame structures, which suggests that
   the ideal-gas flame solutions can be used for flame tabulation. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research defines the basis for a new quantitative approach for
   retrieving useful analogies for innovation based on the relevant
   performance characteristics of functions. The concept of critical
   functionality is the idea of identifying only a certain set of pertinent
   design functions observed in a single domain that significantly define
   the functionality of the product. A critical function (CF) is a function
   within a functional model whose performance directly relates to a key
   performance parameter (KPP) of the system as a whole. These CFs will
   enable multiple analogies to be presented to a designer by recognizing
   similar functionality across distant design domains and incorporating
   key performance criteria. The ultimate focus of this research project is
   to create a performance-metric-based analogy library, called the design
   analogy performance parameter system (DAPPS). By focusing on a select
   set of ``critical{''} functions, more design domains can be included in
   the database facilitating analogy retrieval founded on the qualification
   of KPPs.}},

Title = {{Marginal Benefit of Adding Antennas to Bluetooth Sensor Arrays in
   Freeway Travel Time Data Collection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of Bluetooth detection systems for collecting travel time data
   is becoming increasingly popular because data can be collected
   continuously at a relatively low cost. However, representativeness of
   the data can be problematic, given the relatively low detection
   efficiency of Bluetooth monitoring systems. This paper investigates the
   use of multiple sensors with individual antennas to the same Bluetooth
   data collection device to increase the number of identifications from
   passing vehicles at each data collection point. Increased detection
   potentially increases the number of travel time measurements, increasing
   the potential for the measurements to better represent the travel
   conditions on the roadway. To test this approach, devices with up to 10
   Bluetooth sensors were deployed concurrently on a freeway overpass. The
   marginal benefit of additional Bluetooth sensors in the array was
   investigated. The additional detections captured by adding up to six
   Bluetooth sensors in a single sensor array outnumber the detection
   losses associated with possible radio interference between the Bluetooth
   sensors or in device-to-sensor communication. On average, additional
   Bluetooth device media access control (MAC) addresses were detected by
   increasing the number of sensors from one to two (61\% increase), two to
   three (27\% additional increase), three to four (16\% additional
   increase), four to five (11\% additional increase), and five to six (8\%
   additional increase). Also, it was observed that additional travel time
   measurements were collected by adding the number of sensors from one
   sensor at both locations to a two-sensor setup at both locations
   (between 110 and 156\%), from a two-sensor setup to a three-sensor setup
   (between 44 and 60\%), from a three-sensor setup to a four-sensor setup
   (between 30 and 47\%), from a four-sensor setup to a five-sensor setup
   (between 10 and 20\%), and from a five-sensor setup to a six-sensor
   setup (between 8 and 17\%). This field study indicates that there are
   potential benefits to using multisensor Bluetooth arrays in lieu of the
   current practice of using a single sensor configuration to capture
   additional travel time data from passing vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Scanning laser epitaxy (SLE) is a new laser-based additive manufacturing
   technology under development at the Georgia Institute of Technology. SLE
   is aimed at the creation of equiaxed, directionally solidified, and
   single-crystal deposits of nickel-based superalloys through the melting
   of alloy powders onto superalloy substrates using a fast scanning Nd:YAG
   laser beam. The fast galvanometer control movement of the laser (0.2 to
   2 m/s) and high-resolution raster scanning (20 to 200 A mu m line
   spacing) enables superior thermal control over the solidification
   process and allows the production of porosity-free, crack-free deposits
   of more than 1000 A mu m thickness. Here, we present a combined thermal
   and fluid flow model of the SLE process applied to alloy CMSX-4 with
   temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties. With the scanning beam
   described as a moving line source, the instantaneous melt pool assumes a
   convex hull shape with distinct leading edge and trailing edge
   characteristics. Temperature gradients at the leading and trailing edges
   are of order 2 x 10(5) and 10(4) K/m, respectively. Detailed flow
   analysis provides insights on the flow characteristics of the powder
   incorporating into the melt pool, showing velocities of order 1 x 10(-4)
   m/s. The Marangoni effect drives this velocity from 10 to 15 times
   higher depending on the operating parameters. Prediction of the
   solidification microstructure is based on conditions at the trailing
   edge of the melt pool. Time tracking of solidification history is
   incorporated into the model to couple the microstructure prediction
   model to the thermal-fluid flow model, and to predict the probability of
   the columnar-to-equiaxed transition. Qualitative agreement is obtained
   between simulation and experimental result.}},

   presented a comprehensive thermal, fluid flow, and solidification model
   that can predict the temperature distribution and flow characteristics
   for the processing of CMSX-4 alloy powder through scanning laser epitaxy
   (SLE). SLE is an additive manufacturing technology aimed at the creation
   of equiaxed, directionally solidified and single-crystal (SX) deposits
   of nickel-based superalloys using a fast-scanning laser beam. Part II
   here further explores the Marangoni convection-based model to predict
   the solidification microstructure as a function of the conditions at the
   trailing edge of the melt pool formed during the SLE process. Empirical
   values for several microstructural characteristics such as the primary
   dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET)
   criterion and the oriented-to-misoriented transition (OMT) criterion are
   obtained. Optical microscopy provides visual information on the various
   microstructural characteristics of the deposited material such as melt
   depth, CET location, OMT location, PDAS, etc. A quantitative and
   consistent investigation of this complex set of characteristics is both
   challenging and unprecedented. A customized image-analysis technique
   based on active contouring is developed to automatically extract these
   data from experimental micrographs. Quantitative metallography verifies
   that even for the raster scan pattern in SLE and the corresponding line
   heat source assumption, the PDAS follows the growth relation w similar
   to G (-0.5) V (-0.25) (w = PDAS, G = temperature gradient and V =
   solidification velocity) developed for marginal stability under
   constrained growth. Models for the CET and OMT are experimentally
   validated, thereby providing powerful predictive capabilities for
   controlling the microstructure of SX alloys processed through SLE.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the design of semidefinite programming (SDP) based
   approximation algorithm for the problem Max Hypergraph Cut with Limited
   Unbalance (MHC-LU): Find a partition of the vertices of a weighted
   hypergraph H = (V, E) into two subsets V-1, V-2 with vertical bar
   vertical bar V-2 vertical bar - vertical bar V-1 vertical bar vertical
   bar <= u for some given u and maximizing the total weight of the edges
   meeting both V-1 and V-2. The problem MHC-LU generalizes several other
   combinatorial optimization problems including Max Cut, Max Cut with
   Limited Unbalance (MC-LU), Max Set Splitting, Max Ek-Set Splitting and
   Max Hypergraph Bisection. By generalizing several earlier ideas, we
   present an SDP randomized approximation algorithm for MHC-LU with
   guaranteed worst-case performance ratios for various unbalance
   parameters tau = u/vertical bar V vertical bar. We also give the
   worst-case performance ratio of the SDP-algorithm for approximating
   MHC-LU regardless of the value of tau. Our strengthened SDP relaxation
   and rounding method improve a result of Ageev and Sviridenko (2000) on
   Max Hypergraph Bisection (MHC-LU with u = 0), and results of Andersson
   and Engebretsen (1999), Gaur and Krishnamurti (2001) and Zhang et al.
   (2004) on Max Set Splitting (MHC-LU with u = vertical bar V vertical
   bar. Furthermore, our new formula for the performance ratio by a tighter
   analysis compared with that in Galbiati and Maffioli (2007) is
   responsible for the improvement of a result of Calbiati and Maffioli
   (2007) on MC-LU for some range of tau.}},

Abstract = {{There are several applications of wireless electronic components with
   little or no ambient energy available to harvest, yet wireless battery
   charging for such systems is still of great interest. Example
   applications range from biomedical implants to sensors located in
   hazardous environments. Energy transfer based on the propagation of
   acoustic waves at ultrasonic frequencies is a recently explored
   alternative that offers increased transmitter-receiver distance, reduced
   loss and the elimination of electromagnetic fields. As this research
   area receives growing attention, there is an increased need for fully
   coupled model development to quantify the energy transfer
   characteristics, with a focus on the transmitter, receiver, medium,
   geometric and material parameters. We present multiphysics modeling and
   case studies of the contactless ultrasonic energy transfer for wireless
   electronic components submerged in fluid. The source is a pulsating
   sphere, and the receiver is a piezoelectric bar operating in the 33-mode
   of piezoelectricity with a fundamental resonance frequency above the
   audible frequency range. The goal is to quantify the electrical power
   delivered to the load (connected to the receiver) in terms of the source
   strength. Both the analytical and finite element models have been
   developed for the resulting acoustic-piezoelectric structure interaction
   problem. Resistive and resistive-inductive electrical loading cases are
   presented, and optimality conditions are discussed. Broadband power
   transfer is achieved by optimal resistive-reactive load tuning for
   performance enhancement and frequency-wise robustness. Significant
   enhancement of the power output is reported due to the use of a hard
   piezoelectric receiver (PZT-8) instead of a soft counterpart (PZT-5H) as
   a result of reduced material damping. The analytical multiphysics
   modeling approach given in this work can be used to predict and optimize
   the coupled system dynamics with very good accuracy and dramatically
   improved computational efficiency compared to the use of commercial
   finite element packages.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Two common health disparities in the US include a lack of access to care
   and a lack of insurance coverage. To help address these disparities,
   healthcare reform will provide \$11B to expand Federally Qualified
   Health Centers (FQHCs) over the next 5 years. In 2014, Medicaid rules
   will be modified so that more people will become eligible. There are,
   however, important tradeoffs in the investment in these two programs. We
   find a balanced investment between FQHC expansion and relaxing Medicaid
   eligibility to improve both access (by increasing the number of FQHCs)
   and coverage (by FQHC and Medicaid expansion) for the state of
   Pennsylvania. The comparison is achieved by integrating multi-objective
   mathematical models with several public data sets that allow for
   specific estimations of healthcare need. Demand is estimated based on
   current access and coverage status in order to target groups to be
   considered preferentially. Results show that for Pennsylvania, FQHCs are
   more cost effective than Medicaid if we invest all of the resources in
   just one policy. However, we find a better investment point balancing
   those two policies. This point is approximately where the additional
   expenses incurred from relaxing Medicaid eligibility equals the
   investment in FQHC expansion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an image denoising procedure based on a 2D
   scale-mixing complex-valued wavelet transform. Both the minimal
   (unitary) and redundant (maximum overlap) versions of the transform are
   used. The covariance structure of white noise in wavelet domain is
   established. Estimation is performed via empirical Bayesian techniques,
   including versions that preserve the phase of the complex-valued wavelet
   coefficients and those that do not. The new procedure exhibits excellent
   quantitative and visual performance, which is demonstrated by simulation
   on standard test images.}},

Abstract = {{Most heterogeneous computer aided design (CAD) representations in the
   literature represent materials using a volume fraction vector, which may
   not by physically realizable or meaningful. In contrast, the multiscale,
   heterogeneous CAD representation presented here models materials using
   their microstructure. For the specific metal alloys of interest in this
   work, the material model is a probabilistic model of grain
   characteristics, represented as cumulative distribution functions
   (CDFs). Several microstructure reconstruction algorithms are presented
   that enable different alloy grain structures to be reconstructed in a
   part model. Reconstructions can be performed at any desired size scale,
   illustrating the multiscale capability of the representation. A part
   rendering algorithm is presented for displaying parts with their
   material microstructures. The multiscale, heterogeneous CAD
   representation is demonstrated on two Inconel alloys and is shown to be
   capable of faithfully reconstructing part representations consistent
   with the probabilistic grain models.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative MRI of neuromelanin (NM) containing structures (referred to
   as NM-MRI) in the brainstem, namely the locus coeruleus (LC) and
   substantia nigra (SN), may assist with the early detection of
   Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as
   differential diagnosis in the early disease stages. In this study, two
   gradient echo (GRE) sequences with magnetization transfer contrast (MTC)
   preparation pulses were developed to simultaneously image the LC and SN.
   This has been a challenge with NM-MRI techniques used in previous
   studies due to the relatively high specific absorption rate (SAR)
   induced by these techniques. In addition, a semi-automated quantitative
   analysis scheme was applied to estimate volumes and contrast-to-noise
   ratios (CNR) of the LC and SN based on segmentation of both structures.
   Compared to a T-1-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence typically used
   for simultaneous imaging of the LC and SN, the two GRE-MTC sequences
   exhibited improved performance in terms of higher sensitivity (in CNR)
   in imaging the SN and lower SAR during the scans. A multiple-measurement
   protocol was adopted as well so that motion degraded measurements could
   be removed and artifacts associated with motion could be corrected. The
   present approach has demonstrated advantages in image acquisition (lower
   SAR and higher sensitivity), image pre-processing (with motion
   correction) and quantitative image analysis (segmentation-based
   estimation of volume and CNR) when compared with existing NM-MRI
   approaches. This approach has potential for detection and monitoring of
   neurodegeneration in LC and SN in disease states including AD and PD.

Abstract = {{This article describes a new gel-spinning process for making
   high-strength poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers. The PEO gel-spinning
   process was enabled through an oligomer/polymer blend in place of

   properties were investigated. A 92/8 wt\% poly(ethylene glycol)/PEO gel
   exhibited a melting temperature around 45 degrees C and was highly
   stretchable at room temperature. Some salient features of a gel-spun PEO
   fiber with a draw ratio of 60 are tensile strength at break=0.66 +/-
   0.04 GPa, Young's modulus=4.3 +/- 0.1 GPa, and a toughness corresponding
   to 117 MJ/m(3). These numbers are significantly higher than those
   previously reported. Wide-angle x-ray diffraction of the high-strength
   fibers showed good molecular orientation along the fiber direction. The
   results also demonstrate the potential of further improvement of

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{During development, cell fate specification and tissue development are
   orchestrated by the sequential presentation of soluble growth factors
   (GF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Similarly,
   differentiation of stem cells in vitro relies upon the temporal presence
   of extracellular cues within the microenvironment. Hydrodynamic culture
   systems are not limited by volume restrictions and therefore offer
   several practical advantages for scalability over static cultures;
   however, hydrodynamic cultures expose cells to physical parameters not
   present in static culture, such as fluid shear stress and mass transfer
   through convective forces. In this study, the differences between static
   and hydrodynamic culture conditions on the expression of ECM and GF
   molecules during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells were
   examined at both the gene and protein level. The expression of ECM and
   GF genes exhibited an early decrease in static cultures based on heat
   map and hierarchical clustering analysis and a relative delayed increase
   in hydrodynamic cultures. Although the temporal patterns of specific ECM
   and GF protein expression were comparable between static and
   hydrodynamic cultures, several notable differences in the magnitudes of
   expression were observed at similar time points. These results describe
   the establishment of an analytical framework that can be used to examine
   the expression patterns of ECM and GF molecules expressed by pluripotent
   stem cells undergoing differentiation as 3D multicellular aggregates
   under different culture conditions, and suggest that physical parameters
   of stem cell microenvironments can alter endogenous ECM and GF
   expression profiles that may, in turn, influence cell fate decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous phase hydrodeoxygenation of lignin pyrolysis oil and related
   model compounds were investigated using four noble metals supported on
   activated carbon. The hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol has three major
   reaction pathways and the demethylation reaction, mainly catalyzed by
   Pd, Pt and Rh, produces catechol as the products. The presence of
   catechol and guaiacol in the reaction is responsible for the coke
   formation and the catalysts deactivation. As expected, there was a
   significant decrease in the specific surface area of Pd, Pt and Rh
   catalysts during the catalytic reaction because of the coke deposition.
   In contrast, no catechol was produced from guaiacol when Ru was used so
   a completely hydrogenation was accomplished. The lignin pyrolysis oil
   upgrading with Pt and Ru catalysts further validated the reaction
   mechanism deduced from model compounds. Fully hydrogenated bio-oil was
   produced with Ru catalyst. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Chlorella zofingiensis harvesting by dissolved air
   flotation (DAF) was critically evaluated with regard to algal
   concentration, culture conditions, type and dosage of coagulants, and
   recycle ratio. Harvesting efficiency increased with coagulant dosage and
   leveled off at 81\%, 86\%, 91\%, and 87\% when chitosan, Al3+, Fe3+, and
   cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used at dosages of 70, 180,
   250, and 500 mg g(-1), respectively. The DAF efficiency-coagulant dosage
   relationship changed with algal culture conditions. Evaluation of the
   influence of the initial algal concentration and recycle ratio revealed
   that, under conditions typical for algal harvesting, it is possible that
   the number of bubbles is insufficient. A DAF algal harvesting model was
   developed to explain this observation by introducing mass-based floc
   size distributions and a bubble limitation into the white water blanket
   model. The model revealed the importance of coagulation to increase
   floc-bubble collision and attachment, and the preferential interaction
   of bubbles with larger flocs, which limited the availability of bubbles
   to the smaller sized flocs. The harvesting efficiencies predicted by the
   model agree reasonably with experimental data obtained at different Al3+
   dosages, algal concentrations, and recycle ratios. Based on this
   modeling, critical parameters for efficient algal harvesting were
   identified. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Physical aging in carbon molecular sieve membranes}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},

Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{155-166}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers physical aging in carbon molecular sieve (CMS)
   membranes. Moreover, the performance of stabilized membranes under
   practical operating conditions is discussed. Physical aging has been
   studied extensively in glassy polymers, but aging in CMS membranes has
   previously focused primarily on adsorption: either chemisorption of
   oxygen, or physical adsorption of water and organics in the pore
   structures. Experimentally, in this study, for the samples considered,
   all of the above adsorption-induced aging mechanisms were excluded as
   significant factors through thoughtful experimental design. Physical
   aging appears to be the primary cause for rapid changes of transport
   properties in early stages after membrane fabrication for samples
   derived from high fractional free volume precursors. The CMS pores are
   believed to age analogously to the ``unrelaxed free volume{''} in glassy
   polymers. Over time, these pores tend to shrink in order to achieve
   thermodynamically more stable states. Results of sorption tests in CMS
   also support the above hypothesis. The significance of physical aging
   phenomena on membrane testing protocols, structural tailoring, and
   performance evaluation are discussed. A long term permeation test
   demonstrated excellent stability of stabilized CMS membranes under
   realistic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CKD-501 is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR)
   agonist that is effective for the treatment of diabetes. However, its
   carcinogenic potential remains controversial. The current
   carcinogenicity study was conducted over a period of 104 weeks in ICR
   mice. Three groups, each consisting of 60 male and 60 female mice,
   received oral CKD-501 dosages of 0.2, 1.0 or 6.0 mgkg(-1)day(-1). The
   mortality rates of the male control, 0.2, 1.0 and 6.0 mg kg(-1)day(-1)
   treated groups were 60\%, 68\%, 58\% and 67\%, respectively and 57\%,
   68\% and 67\% in the female control, 0.2 and 1.0mgkg(-1)day(-1) treated
   groups. It was 67\% in the female 6.0mgkg(-1)day(-1) treated group,
   which was terminated at week 98 due to its increased mortality rate. No
   significant treatment-related effects were observed on the survival
   rates, with the exception of females in the 6.0mgkg(-1)day(-1) group.
   Body weights increased in females receiving 1.0 and 6.0mgkg(-1)day(-1)
   due to the class effects of the PPAR agonist. Differences were not found
   in hematology parameters between the CKD-501-treated groups and their
   corresponding controls, but the histopathological evidence did not
   reveal any findings attributed to CKD-501. Treated animals exhibited
   non-neoplastic findings (adipocyte proliferation, bone marrow hypoplasia
   cardiomyopathy), but all of these were expected changes for this class
   of compound. There were no treatment-related neoplastic changes in this
   study. The results of this study therefore demonstrate a lack of
   carcinogenicity following oral administration of CKD-501 to ICR mice for
   104weeks. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

   simulating how cells may invade a network. The QDs were added at a
   dilute concentration of 0.1 wt \% to determine if the mechanical
   properties of the fibrin network would be significantly altered and to
   ascertain if the overall stretch on the network could be observed. Based
   on strain sweep and frequency sweep rheological analysis, it was
   determined that both QDs and MMPs incorporated into fibrin networks at
   0.1 wt \% caused irreversible plastic deformation in the fibrin clot

Abstract = {{With the material processing freedoms of additive manufacturing (AM),
   the ability to characterize and control material microstructures is
   essential if part designers are to properly design parts. To integrate
   material information into Computer-aided design (CAD) systems, geometric
   features of material microstructure must be recognized and represented,
   which is the focus of this paper. Linear microstructure features, such
   as fibers or grain boundaries, can be found computationally from
   microstructure images using surfacelet based methods, which include the
   Radon or Radon-like transform followed by a wavelet transform. By
   finding peaks in the transform results, linear features can be
   recognized and characterized by length, orientation, and position. The
   challenge is that often a feature will be imprecisely represented in the
   transformed parameter space. In this paper, we demonstrate
   surfacelet-based methods to recognize microstructure features in parts
   fabricated by AM. We will provide an explicit computational method to
   recognize and to quantify linear geometric features from an image.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterial thermal emitters and absorbers have been widely studied for
   different geometric patterns by exciting a variety of electromagnetic
   resonances. A resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit model is
   developed to describe the magnetic resonances (i.e. magnetic polaritons)
   inside the structures. The RLC circuit model allows the prediction of
   not only the resonance frequency, but also the full width at half
   maximum and quality factor for various geometric patterns. The
   parameters predicted by the RLC model are compared with the
   finite-difference time-domain simulation. The magnetic field
   distribution and the power dissipation density profile are also used to
   justify the RLC circuit model. The geometric effects on the resonance
   characteristics are elucidated in the wire (or strip), cross, and square
   patterned metamaterial in the infrared region. This study will
   facilitate the design of metamaterial absorbers and emitters based on
   magnetic polaritons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to improve the dispersion state of
   nanocrystalline (nc) Fe-Ni particles in polyamide 6 (PA6) matrix and the
   filler-matrix interfacial interactions to provide Fe-Ni alloy/PA6
   nanocomposites of remarkable mechanical performance for engineering
   applications. nc Fe40Ni60 particles were chemically synthesized. Then
   Fe40Ni60/PA6 nanocomposites of various nanofiller loading were prepared
   by compounding via a newly modified master batch technique called
   ultrasound assisted master batch (UMB), followed by injection molding
   (IM). Their mechanical properties, morphology and structural parameters
   were characterized and compared with the corresponding properties of
   Fe40Ni60/PA6 nanocomposites made by solution mixing (SM) and IM. The
   study reveals that the UMB process is more cost effective and time
   efficient, simpler and easier to scale up compared with the SM process.
   In addition, UMB nanocomposites exhibit superior mechanical properties
   and distinctive morphology compared with the corresponding SM ones.
   Moreover, structural analyses indicate that physical structural changes
   occurred in PA6 due to presence of alloy particles are affected
   differently by the different compounding methods, profound understanding
   of such phenomenon is focused throughout the article. These distinctive
   advantages recommend that UMB technique can be of great potential in
   commercial production of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). It is concluded
   that the sonication of nc Fe40Ni60 particles in dilute polymer solution
   during UMB compounding, a new step that is incorporated for the first
   time in the master batch process, is mainly responsible for the good
   wetting between nanoparticles and polymer chains, strong filler-matrix
   interactions and consequently the remarkable mechanical performance of
   UMB PNCs. (C) 2014 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the adsorption of multiple CO2 on Mg-rich
   minerals such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and olivine (MgSi2O4) surface in
   order to understand the adsorption mechanism of CO2 using density

   for the adsorption of CO2 onto Mg2SiO4 surface is 2.5 times (-1.30 eV)
   and 2.7 times (-0.70 eV) higher than that onto MgO surface for single
   and multiple CO2 chemisorption, respectively. The surface coverage (0)
   of Mg2SiO4 surface is 1, which is four times higher than that of MgO

Abstract = {{Based on the recent incidents of H5N1, H1N1, and influenza pandemics in
   history (1918, 1957, and 1968) experts believe that a future influenza
   pandemic is inevitable and likely imminent. Although the severity of
   influenza pandemics vary, evidence suggests that an efficient and rapid
   response is crucial for mitigating morbidity, mortality, and costs to
   society. Hence, preparing for a potential influenza pandemic is a high
   priority of governments at all levels (local, state, federal),
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and companies. In a severe
   pandemic, when a large number of people are ill, infected persons and
   their families may have difficulty purchasing and preparing meals.
   Various government agencies and NGOs plan to provide meals to these
   households. In this paper, in collaboration with the American Red Cross,
   we study food distribution planning during an influenza pandemic. We
   develop a disease spread model to estimate the spread pattern of the
   disease geographically and over time, combine it with a facility
   location and resource allocation network model for food distribution,
   and develop heuristics to find near-optimal solutions for large
   instances. We run our combined disease spread and facility location
   model for the state of Georgia and present the estimated number of
   infections and the number of meals needed in each census tract for a
   one-year period along with a design of the supply chain network.
   Moreover, we investigate the impact of voluntary quarantine on the food
   demand and the food distribution network and show that its effects on
   food distribution can be significant. Our results could help decision
   makers prepare for a pandemic, including how to allocate limited
   resources and respond dynamically.}},

Abstract = {{Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures, which can
   result in progressive cranial deformations, increased intracranial
   pressure, and restricted brain growth. Most cases of craniosynostosis
   require surgical reconstruction of the cranial vault with the goal of
   increasing the intracranial volume and correcting the craniofacial
   deformities. However, patients often experience rapid post-operative
   bone regrowth, known as re-synostosis, which necessitates additional
   surgical intervention. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitors have
   tremendous potential to treat re-synostosis, but the realization of a
   clinically viable inhibitor-based therapeutic requires the development
   of a delivery vehicle that can localize the release to the site of
   administration. Here, we present an in situ rapidly crosslinking
   injectable hydrogel that has the properties necessary to encapsulate
   co-administered proteins and demonstrate that the delivery of rmGremlin1
   via our hydrogel system delays bone regrowth in a weanling mouse model
   of re-synostosis. Our hydrogel is composed of two mutually reactive
   poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecules, which when mixed crosslink via a
   bio-orthogonal Cu free click reaction. Hydrogels containing Gremlin
   caused a dose dependent inhibition of bone regrowth. In addition to
   craniofacial applications, our injectable click hydrogel has the
   potential to provide customizable protein, small molecule, and cell
   delivery to any site accessible via needle or catheter. (C) 2014

Title = {{Evaluating the potential for energy extraction from turbines in the gulf
   stream system}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{12-21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increasing energy consumption and decreasing reserves of fossil fuels
   have led to growing interest in renewable energy from the ocean. Ocean
   currents are an alternative source of clean energy due to their inherent
   reliability, persistence and sustainability. General ocean circulations
   exist in the form of large rotating ocean gyres, and feature extremely
   rapid current flow in the western boundaries due to the Coriolis effect.
   The Gulf Stream system is formed by the western boundary current of the
   North Atlantic Ocean that flows along the east coastline of the United
   States, and therefore is of particular interest as a potential energy
   resource for the United States. The theoretical energy balance in the
   Gulf Stream system is examined using the two-dimensional ocean
   circulation equations based on the assumptions of the Stommel model for
   subtropical gyres with the quasi-geostrophic balance between pressure
   gradient, Coriolis force, wind stress and friction driving the
   circulation. To represent flow dissipation due to turbines a spatially
   varying turbine drag coefficient is formulated and a finite difference
   numerical approach is utilized to obtain an implicit solution of the
   model. The results show that considering extraction over a region
   representing the entire Florida Current portion of the Gulf Stream
   system, the average power dissipated ranges between 4 and 6 GW with a
   mean around 5.1 GW. This corresponds to an average of approximately 45
   TWh/yr. However, if the extraction area approximates the entire portion
   of the Gulf Stream within 200 miles of the US coastline, the average
   power dissipated becomes 18.6 GW or 163 TWh/yr. The impact of the
   localized turbine drag on the hydrodynamics is primarily within the
   turbine region. The extra drag force from turbines slows down the
   current velocity and leads to redirection of the Gulf Stream flow. It
   also results in a sea surface drop in the turbine region. Localized
   turbine drag significantly reduces residual kinetic energy flux in the
   circulation. However, its influence on the residual volume flux depends
   on the area of the turbine region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   topic spotting on conversational speech. Rather than mapping the input
   weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs) onto a high dimensional n-gram
   feature space as in n-gram rational kernels, the proposed LSRK maps the
   WFSTs onto a latent semantic space. With the proposed LSRK, all
   available external knowledge and techniques can be flexibly integrated
   into a unified WFST based framework to boost the topic spotting
   performance. We present how to generalize the LSRK using tf-idf
   weighting, latent semantic analysis, WordNet and probabilistic topic
   models. To validate the proposed LSRK framework, we conduct the topic
   spotting experiments on two datasets, Switchboard and AT\&T HMIHY0300

Abstract = {{N-doped highly microporous carbons have been successfully fabricated
   from N-rich microalgae by the combination of low-cost hydrothermal
   carbonization and industry-adopted KOH activation processes. The
   hydrothermal carbonization process was found to be an essential step for
   the successful conversion of microalgae into a carbon material. The
   materials thus synthesized showed BET surface areas in the range similar
   to 1800-2200 m(2) g(-1) exclusively ascribed to micropores. The carbons
   showed N contents in the 0.7-2.7 wt.\%, owing to the use of N-rich
   microalgae as a carbon precursor. When tested in symmetric double layer
   capacitors (occasionally called supercapacitors) based on aqueous LiCl
   electrolytes, pseudocapacitance was only observable for the sample
   synthesized at the lowest temperature, 650 degrees C, which is the one
   exhibiting the largest amount of N- and O-containing groups. The samples
   synthesized at 700-750 degrees C exhibited excellent rate capability
   (only 20\% of capacitance loose at 20 A g(-1)), with specific
   capacitances of 170-200 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1). These materials showed
   excellent long-term cycling stability under high current densities. (C)

   theory (MP2), MP2.5, CCSD, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with
   perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods for equilibrium geometries,
   hydrogen transfer reactions between radicals, and noncovalent
   interactions. For bond lengths of both closed and open-shell molecules,
   the OMP2.5 method improves upon MP2.5 and CCSD by 38\%-43\% and
   31\%-28\%, respectively, with Dunning's cc-pCVQZ basis set. For complete
   basis set (CBS) predictions of hydrogen transfer reaction energies, the
   OMP2.5 method exhibits a substantially better performance than MP2.5,
   providing a mean absolute error of 1.1 kcal mol(-1), which is more than
   10 times lower than that of MP2.5 (11.8 kcal mol(-1)), and comparing
   toMP2 (14.6 kcal mol(-1)) there is a more than 12-fold reduction in
   errors. For noncovalent interaction energies (at CBS limits), the OMP2.5
   method maintains the very good performance of MP2.5 for closed-shell
   systems, and for open-shell systems it significantly outperforms MP2.5
   and CCSD, and approaches CCSD(T) quality. The MP2.5 errors decrease by a
   factor of 5 when the optimized orbitals are used for open-shell
   noncovalent interactions, and comparing to CCSD there is a more than
   3-fold reduction in errors. Overall, the present application results
   indicate that the OMP2.5 method is very promising for open-shell
   noncovalent interactions and other chemical systems with difficult
   electronic structures. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic model forecasts are commonly biased in watersheds where water
   use and regulation activities cause flow alterations. Furthermore,
   direct accounting of such biases in forecast preparation is impractical
   as the information required is extensive and usually unavailable. This
   article introduces a new method to characterize the aggregate flow
   alteration biases and associated uncertainty in watersheds with
   important but largely undocumented water use and regulation activities.
   It also uses these assessments to adjust the ensemble streamflow
   predictions at downstream locations. The method includes procedures to
   (a) detect the presence of significant upstream regulation and water use
   influences; (b) correct the ensemble streamflow predictions and
   associated uncertainty for any biases in periods when such influences
   are detectable; and (c) assess the adjusted forecast reliability
   improvements. Applications in three watersheds of the American River in
   California demonstrate that the new method leads to significant forecast
   skill improvements and is also readily applicable to other regions. (C)

Title = {{Power Density Assessment of Variable Volume Batch Reactors for Hydrogen
   Production with Dynamically Modulated Liquid Fuel Introduction}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A new concept of a dynamically controlled reactor, which combines the
   variable volume operation of CHAMP (CO2/H-2 Active Membrane Piston) with
   direct injection of liquid fuel of DDIR (Direct Droplet Impingement
   Reactor), is introduced and analyzed with the primary goal of
   identifying conditions for the highest volumetric power (hydrogen yield)
   density. In the proposed CHAMP-DDIR, a liquid fuel mixture is
   pulsed-injected onto the heated catalyst surface for rapid flash
   volatilization and on-the-spot reaction, and a hydrogen selective
   membrane is collocated with the catalyst to reduce the diffusion
   distance for hydrogen transport from the reaction zone to the separation
   site. Uniquely, CHAMP-DDIR allows dynamic variation of the reactor
   volume to optimally control the residence time and reactor conditions
   (pressure and temperature), thus improving both the reaction and
   separation processes. Idealized CHAMP-DDIR simulations, without heat and
   mass transfer limitations in the reactor volume, are used to determine
   the theoretical limits on power density for various operational
   conditions. An enhanced CHAMP-DDIR model, which accounts for the effects
   of mass transport limitations and bulk temperature changes in time, is
   employed to evaluate possible performance improvement through combining
   time-modulated fuel introduction and the active change of reactor
   volume. Analysis reveals that significant improvement in the volumetric
   power density can be achieved primarily as a result of two factors:
   time-modulated fuel injections enable higher reaction/permeation rates
   by preventing the large temperature drop that accompanies a single batch
   liquid fuel injection and volume modulation during a batch cycle allows
   for reduction in required reactor volume under a constraint of maximum
   operating pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal particles suspended in aqueous electrolyte solutions flowing
   through microchannels are subject to lift forces that repel the
   particles from the wall due to the voltage and pressure gradients
   commonly used to drive flows in microfluidic devices. There are very few
   studies that have considered particles subject to both an electric field
   and a pressure gradient, however. Evanescent-wave particle tracking
   velocimetry was therefore used to investigate the near-wall dynamics of
   a dilute suspension of 245 nm radius polystyrene particles in a
   monovalent electrolyte solution in Poiseuille and combined
   electroosmotic (EO) and Poiseuille flow through 30-mu m-deep
   fused-silica channels. The lift force observed in Poiseuille flow, which
   is estimated from the near-wall particle distribution, appears to be
   proportional to the shear rate, a scaling consistent with hydrodynamic
   lift forces previously reported in field-flow fractionation studies. The
   estimates of the lift force observed in combined flow suggest that the
   force magnitude exceeds the sum of the lift forces observed in EO flow
   at the same electric field or in Poiseuille flow at the same shear rate.
   Moreover, the force magnitude appears to be proportional to the electric
   field magnitude and have a power law dependence on the shear rate with
   an exponent between 0.4 and 0.5. This unexpected scaling suggests that
   the repulsive lift force observed in combined electroosmotic and
   Poiseuille flow is a new phenomenon, distinct from previously reported
   electroviscous, hydrodynamic lift, or dielectrophoretic-like forces, and
   warrants further study.}},

Abstract = {{Star polyelectrolytes (poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)
   (PDMAEMA)) with dual (temperature and pH) responsive properties were
   utilized to fabricate multiresponsive microcapsules via layer-by-layer
   (LbL) assembly. The LbL microcapsules are very robust and uniform, with
   higher stability and different internal structure compared with
   conventional microcapsules based on linear polyelectrolytes. Ionic
   strength in the polyelectrolyte solution during the microcapsule
   assembly process has a significant influence on the thickness and
   permeability of microcapsules. With increasing pH, the permeability of
   microcapsules decreases, and the transition from open to closed state
   for target molecules can be achieved within a narrow pH range (from pH 7
   to 8). On the other hand, the overall size and permeability of the
   microcapsules decrease with increasing temperature (with a shrinkage of
   54\% in diameter at 60 degrees C compared with room temperature), thus
   allowing to reversibly load and unload the microcapsules with high
   efficiency. The organization and interaction of star polyelectrolytes
   within confined multilayer structure are the main driving forces for the
   responsiveness to external stimuli. The multiresponsive LbL
   microcapsules represent a novel category of smart microstructures as
   compared to traditional LbL microcapsules with one-dimensional response
   to a single stimulus, and they also have the potential to mimic the
   complex responsive microstructures found in nature and find applications
   in drug delivery, smart coatings, microreactors, and biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Injection-limited contacts in many of electronic devices such as
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and field effect transistors (FETs) are not
   easily avoided. We demonstrate that charge injection in the
   injection-limited contact is determined by charge transport properties
   as well as the charge injection energy barrier due to vacuum energy
   level alignment. Interestingly, injection-limited contact properties
   were observed at 5 nm diameter lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dot (QD)/Au
   contacts for which carrier injection is predicted to be energetically
   favorable. To probe the effect of charge transport properties on carrier
   injection, the electrical channel resistance of PbS nanocrystal (NC)
   FETs was varied through thermal annealing, photoillumination, ligand
   exchange, surface treatment of the gate dielectric, and use of different
   sized PbS NCs. Injection current through the PbS/Au contact varied with
   the FET mobility of PbS NC films consistent with a theoretical
   prediction where the net injection current is dominated by carrier
   mobility. This result suggests that the charge transport properties,
   that is, mobility, of QD NC films should be considered as a means to
   enhance carrier injection along with the vacuum level energy alignment
   at the interface between QD NCs and metal electrodes. Photocurrent
   microscopic images of the PbS/Au contact demonstrate the presence of a
   built-in potential in a two-dimensionally continuous PbS film near the
   metal electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Polymethine dyes in dilute solutions display many of the optical
   properties required for all-optical switching applications. However, in
   thin films, aggregation and polymethinecounterion interactions can
   substantially modify their properties and limit their utility. Here, we
   examine the impact of a series of bulky substituents on the solid-state
   molecular packing of thiopyrylium polymethines by using a theoretical
   approach combining molecular-dynamics simulations and quantum-chemical
   calculations. Importantly, it is found that the positions of the
   substituents near the center and/or ends of the dye determine the extent
   to which aggregation is reduced; in particular, substituents near the
   polymethine center primarily modify the type of aggregation that is
   observed, while substituents near the polymethine ends reduce
   aggregation and aid in maintaining solution-like properties in the solid
   state. Our theoretical study elucidates relationships between molecular
   structure and bulk optical properties and provides design guidelines for
   all-optical switching materials.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, nonlinear oscillators have been given growing
   attention due to their ability to enhance the performance of energy
   harvesting devices by increasing the frequency bandwidth. Duffing
   oscillators are a type of nonlinear oscillator characterized by a
   symmetric hardening or softening cubic restoring force. In order to
   realize the cubic nonlinearity in a cantilever at reasonable excitation
   levels, often an external magnetic field or mechanical load is imposed,
   since the inherent geometric nonlinearity would otherwise require
   impractically high excitation levels to be pronounced. As an alternative
   to magnetoelastic structures and other complex forms of symmetric
   Duffing oscillators, an M-shaped nonlinear bent beam with clamped end
   conditions is presented and investigated for bandwidth enhancement under
   base excitation. The proposed M-shaped oscillator made of spring steel
   is very easy to fabricate as it does not require extra discrete
   components to assemble, and furthermore, its asymmetric nonlinear
   behavior can be pronounced yielding broadband behavior under low
   excitation levels. For a prototype configuration, linear and nonlinear
   system parameters extracted from experiments are used to develop a
   lumped-parameter mathematical model. Quadratic damping is included in
   the model to account for nonlinear dissipative effects. A multi-term
   harmonic balance solution is obtained to study the effects of higher
   harmonics and a constant term. A single-term closed-form frequency
   response equation is also extracted and compared with the multi-term
   harmonic balance solution. It is observed that the single-term solution
   overestimates the frequency of upper saddle-node bifurcation point and
   underestimates the response magnitude in the large response branch.
   Multi-term solutions can be as accurate as time-domain solutions, with
   the advantage of significantly reduced computation time. Overall,
   substantial bandwidth enhancement with increasing base excitation is
   validated experimentally, analytically, and numerically. As compared to
   the 3 dB bandwidth of the corresponding linear system with the same
   linear damping ratio, the M-shaped oscillator offers 3200, 5600, and
   8900 percent bandwidth enhancement at the root-mean-square base
   excitation levels of 0.03g, 0.05g, and 0.07g, respectively. The M-shaped
   configuration can easily be exploited in piezoelectric and
   electromagnetic energy harvesting as well as their hybrid combinations
   due to the existence of both large strain and kinetic energy regions. A
   demonstrative case study is given for electromagnetic energy harvesting,
   revealing the importance of higher harmonics and the need for multi-term
   harmonic balance analysis for predicting the electrical power output
   accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous methods are available to calculate rotordynamic whirl
   frequencies, including analytic methods, finite element analysis, and
   the transfer matrix method. The typical real-valued transfer matrix
   (RTM) suffers from several deficiencies, including lengthy computation
   times and the inability to distinguish forward and backward whirl.
   Though application of complex coordinates in rotordynamic analysis is
   not novel per se, specific advantages gained from using such coordinates
   in a transfer matrix analysis have yet to be elucidated. The present
   work employs a complex coordinate redefinition of the transfer matrix to
   obtain reduced forms of the elemental transfer matrices in inertial and
   rotating reference frames, including external stiffness and damping.
   Application of the complex-valued state variable redefinition results in
   a reduction of the 8 x 8 RTM to the 4 x 4 Complex Transfer Matrix (CTM).
   The CTM is advantageous in that it intrinsically separates forward and
   backward whirl, eases symbolic manipulation by halving the transfer
   matrices' dimension, and provides significant improvement in computation
   time. A symbolic analysis is performed on a simple overhung rotor to
   demonstrate the mathematical motivation for whirl frequency separation.
   The CTM's utility is further shown by analyzing a rotordynamic system
   supported by viscoelastic elastomer rings. Viscoelastic elastomer ring
   supports can provide significant damping while reducing the cost and
   complexity associated with conventional components such as squeeze film
   dampers. The stiffness and damping of a viscoelastic damper ring are
   determined herein as a function of whirl frequency using the
   viscoelastic correspondence principle and a constitutive fractional
   calculus viscoelasticity model. The CTM is then employed to obtain the
   characteristic equation, where the whirl frequency dependent stiffness
   and damping of the elastomer supports are included. The Campbell diagram
   is shown, demonstrating the CTM's ability to intrinsically separate
   synchronous whirl direction for a non-trivial rotordynamic system. Good
   agreement is found between the CM results and previously obtained
   analytic and experimental results for the elastomer ring supported
   rotordynamic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Nanowires made of metallic glass have been actively pursued recently due
   to the superb and unique properties over those of the crystalline
   materials. The amorphous nanowires are synthesized either at high
   temperature or via mechanical disruption using focused ion beam. These
   processes have potential to cause significant changes in structure and
   chemical concentration, as well as formation of defect or imperfection,
   but little is known to date about the possibilities and mechanisms.
   Here, we report chemical segregation to surfaces and its mechanisms in
   metallic glass nanowires made of binary Cu and Zr elements from
   molecular dynamics simulation. Strong concentration deviation are found
   in the nanowires under the conditions similar to these in experiment via
   focused ion beam processing, hot imprinting, and casting by rapid
   cooling from liquid state. Our analysis indicates that non-uniform
   internal stress distribution is a major cause for the chemical
   segregation, especially at low temperatures. Extension is discussed for
   this observation to multicomponent metallic glass nanowires as well as
   the potential applications and side effects of the composition
   modulation. The finding also points to the possibility of the
   mechanical-chemical process that may occur in different settings such as
   fracture, cavitation, and foams where strong internal stress is present
   in small length scales. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study of the limit of detection (LOD) in resonance-based
   silicon photonic lab-on-chip sensors is presented. The effects of the
   noise, temperature fluctuations, and the fundamental thermodynamic limit
   of the resonator are studied. Wavelength noise is identified as the
   dominant source of noise, and an efficient technique for suppressing
   this noise is presented. A large ensemble of statistical data from the
   transmission measurements in a laser-scanning configuration on five
   silicon nitride (SiN) microrings is collected to discuss and identify
   the sources of noise. The experimental results show that the LOD is
   limited by a 3 sigma wavelength noise of similar to 1.8 pm. We present a
   sub-periodic interferometric technique, relying on an inverse algorithm,
   to suppress this noise. Our technique reduces the wavelength noise by
   more than one order of magnitude to an ensemble average of 3 sigma = 120
   fm, for a resonator quality factor (Q) of about 5 x 10(4) without any
   temperature stabilization or cooling. This technique is readily amenable

Abstract = {{The possibility of in situ doping during electrochemical anodization of
   titania nanotube arrays is demonstrated and the mechanism and variations
   in structural and electronic characteristics of the nanotube arrays as
   after doping is systematically explored. In the presence of strontium as
   the dopant, bulk analysis shows strontium mainly incorporated into the
   lattice of TiO2. Surface analysis, however, reveals phase segregation of
   SrO in the TiO2 matrix at high Sr doping levels. The near edge X-ray
   absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy analysis reveals that
   Sr2+ doping only alters the Ti and O ions interaction in the TiO2
   lattice on the surface with no effect on their individual charge states.
   An in-depth understanding of the dopant incorporation mechanism and
   distribution into TiO2 nanotube arrays is achieved using high resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and the high angle annular
   dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
   coupled with the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements
   on the surface and bulk of the nanotubes. Upon their use to
   photoelectrochemically split water, the Sr-doped TiO2 nanotube film
   shows incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as high as 65\%.
   The enhanced light activity in conjunction with the ordered
   one-dimensional morphology makes the fabricated films promising
   candidates for water photoelectrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered metal-dielectric-metal nanostructures with broadband
   absorbing properties in the visible spectral range are fabricated by
   combining the plasmonic resonances of different noble metal
   nanostructures. Silver nanocubes and gold nanogratings couple to each
   other using a dielectric polymer spacer with controllable thickness,
   resulting in a large multiplicative enhancement of absorption properties
   across a broad spectral range. Narrow, long nanogrooves in a gold film
   are first fabricated using electron beam lithography, after which a
   polymer spacer layer with a controllable thickness ranging from 4 to 12
   nm is assembled by spin-assisted layer-by-layer assembly. Finally,
   silver nanocubes with different surface coverages ranging from 12\% to
   22\% are deposited using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The individual
   plasmon resonances of these different nanostructures are located at
   significantly different optical frequencies and are tuned in this study
   to allow a significant increase of light absorbance of the original
   gratings to an average value of 84\% across the broad wavelength range

Title = {{Impaired Bone Formation in Pdia3 Deficient Mice}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 {[}1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3] is crucial for
   normal skeletal development and bone homeostasis. Protein disulfide
   isomerase family A, member 3 (PDIA3) mediates 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3
   initiated-rapid membrane signaling in several cell types. To understand
   its role in regulating skeletal development, we generated
   Pdia3-deficient mice and examined the physiologic consequence of
   Pdia3-disruption in embryos and Pdia3(+/-) heterozygotes at different
   ages. No mice homozygous for the Pdia3-deletion were found at birth nor
   were there embryos after E12.5, indicating that targeted disruption of
   the Pdia3 gene resulted in early embryonic lethality. Pdia3-deficiency
   also resulted in skeletal manifestations as revealed by mu CT analysis
   of the tibias. In comparison to wild type mice, Pdia3 heterozygous mice
   displayed expanded growth plates associated with decreased tether
   formation. Histomorphometry also showed that the hypertrophic zone in
   Pdia3(+/-) mice was more cellular than seen in wild type growth plates.
   Metaphyseal trabecular bone in Pdia3(+/-) mice exhibited an
   age-dependent phenotype with lower BV/TV and trabecular numbers, which
   was most pronounced at 15 weeks of age. Bone marrow cells from
   Pdia3(+/-) mice exhibited impaired osteoblastic differentiation, based
   on reduced expression of osteoblast markers and mineral deposition
   compared to cells from wild type animals. Collectively, our findings
   provide in vivo evidence that PDIA3 is essential for normal skeletal
   development. The fact that the Pdia3(+/-) heterozygous mice share a
   similar growth plate and bone phenotype to nVdr knockout mice, suggests
   that PDIA3-mediated rapid membrane signaling might be an alternative
   mechanism responsible for 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3's actions in regulating
   skeletal development.}},

Abstract = {{Veterinary ionophore antibiotics (IPAs) are polyether compounds used
   extensively in the livestock industry to promote animal growth and
   prevent coccidia infection. However, the environmental fate and impact
   of IPAs are not fully understood. In this study, the inhibition and
   biotransformation potential of the most commonly used IPAs, monensin
   (MON) and salinomycin (SAL), were investigated under well-defined
   aerobic, nitrate-reducing, fermentative/sulfate-reducing, and
   fermentative/methanogenic conditions. Batch assays were conducted with
   mixed cultures developed from poultry litter (PL), PL-fertilized soil,
   and municipal anaerobic sludge. Significant transformation of MON and
   SAL was observed in aerobic, low-buffer capacity culture series as a
   result of abiotic acid-catalyzed IPAs hydrolysis induced by
   nitrification. Biotransformation of IPAs was the main transformation
   process in aerobic, high-buffer capacity culture series. MON persisted
   under fermentative/sulfate-reducing conditions, whereas SAL was
   transformed by fermentative bacteria. Both MON and SAL were stable under
   nitrate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. At IPAs concentrations up
   to 1 mg/L, MON inhibited only methanogenesis, whereas SAL did not impact
   any of the biological processes investigated in this study. Multiple,
   new primary IPA biotransformation products were observed on LC/MS, and
   their molecular structures were tentatively identified by analyzing
   LC/MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Overall, MON and SAL exhibited
   different inhibition and biotransformation patterns at each redox
   condition tested, which could greatly influence their fate and impact
   upon their release into the environment as a result of agricultural
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{The veterinary ionophore antibiotics (IPAs) are extensively used as
   coccidiostats and growth promoters and are released to the environment
   via land application of animal waste. Due to their propensity to be
   transported with runoff, IPAs likely end up in surface waters where they
   are subject to photodegradation. This study is among the first to
   investigate the photodegradation of three commonly used IPAs, monensin
   (MON), salinomycin (SAL) and narasin (NAR), under UV and solar
   irradiation. Results showed that MON was persistent in a deionized (DI)
   water matrix when exposed to UV and sunlight, whereas SAL and NAR could
   undergo direct photolysis with a high quantum yield. Water components
   including nitrate and dissolved organic matter had a great impact on the
   photodegradation of IPAs. A pseudosteady state kinetic model was
   successfully applied to predict IPAs' photodegradation rates in real
   water matrices. Applying LC/MS/MS, multiple photolytic transformation
   products of IPAs were observed and their structures were proposed. The
   direct photolysis of SAL and NAR occurred via cleavage on the ketone
   moiety and self-sensitized photolysis. With the presence of nitrate, MON
   was primarily degraded by hydroxyl radicals, whereas SAL showed
   reactivity toward both hydroxyl and nitrogen-dioxide radicals.
   Additionally, toxicity tests showed that photodegradation of SAL
   eliminated its antibiotic properties against Bacillus subtilis.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile chlorinated compounds are major pollutants in groundwater, and
   they pose a risk of vapor intrusion into buildings. Vapor intrusion can
   be prevented by natural attenuation in the vadose zone if biodegradation
   mechanisms can be established. In this study, we tested the hypothesis
   that bacteria can use cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) or vinyl chloride
   (VC) as an electron donor in the vadose zone. Anoxic water containing
   cis-DCE or VC was pumped continuously beneath laboratory columns that
   represented the vadose zone. Columns were inoculated with Polaromonas
   sp. strain JS666, which grows aerobically on cis-DCE, or with
   Mycobacterium sp. JS60 and Nocardiodes sp. JS614 that grow on VC.
   Complete biodegradation with fluxes of 84 +/- 15 mu mol of
   cis-DCE.m(-2).hr(-1) and 218 +/- 25 mu mole VC.m(-2).h(-1) within the 23
   cm column indicated that microbial activities can prevent the migration
   of cis-DCE and VC vapors. Oxygen and volatile compound profiles along
   with enumeration of bacterial populations indicated that most of the
   biodegradation took place in the first 10 cm above the saturated zone
   within the capillary fringe. The results revealed that cis-DCE and VC
   can be biodegraded readily at the oxic/anoxic interfaces in the vadose
   zone if appropriate microbes are present.}},

Abstract = {{Metal hydrides with enhanced thermodynamic stability with respect to the
   associated binary hydrides are useful for high temperature applications
   in which highly stable materials with low hydrogen overpressures are
   desired. Though several examples of complex transition metal hydrides
   (CTMHs) with such enhanced stability are known, little thermodynamic or
   phase stability information is available for this materials class. In
   this work, we use semiautomated thermodynamic and phase diagram
   calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and grand
   canonical linear programming (GCLP) methods to screen 102 ternary and
   quaternary CTMHs and 26 ternary saline hydrides in a library of over 260
   metals, intermetallics, binary, and higher hydrides to identify
   materials that release hydrogen at higher temperatures than the
   associated binary hydrides and at elevated temperatures, T > 1000 K, for
   1 bar H-2 overpressure. For computational efficiency, we employ a tiered
   screening approach based first on solid phase ground state energies with
   temperature effects controlled via H-2 gas alone and second on the
   inclusion of phonon calculations that correct solid phase free energies
   for temperature-dependent vibrational contributions. We successfully
   identified 13 candidate CTMHs including Eu2RuH6, Yb2RuH6, Ca2RuH6,
   Ca2OsH6, Ba2RuH6, Ba3Ir2H12, Li4RH4, NaPd3H2, Cs2PtH4, K2PtH4, Cs3PtH5,
   Cs3PdH3, and Rb2PtH4. The most stable CTMHs tend to crystallize in the
   Sr2RuH6 cubic prototype structure and decompose to the pure elements and
   hydrogen rather than to intermetallic phases.}},

Abstract = {{Metal hydrides with high thermodynamic stability are desirable for
   high-temperature applications, such as those that require high hydrogen
   release temperatures or low hydrogen overpressures. First-principles
   calculations have been used previously to identify complex transition
   metal hydrides (CTMHs) for high temperature use by screening materials
   with experimentally known structures. Here, we extend our previous
   screening of CTMHs with a library of 149 proposed materials based on
   known prototype structures and charge balancing rules. These proposed
   materials are typically related to known materials by cation
   substitution. Our semiautomated, high-throughput screening uses density
   functional theory (DFT) and grand canonical linear programming (GCLP)
   methods to compute thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams: 81 of
   the 149 materials are found to be thermodynamically stable. We
   identified seven proposed materials that release hydrogen at higher
   temperatures than the associated binary hydrides and at high
   temperature, T > 1000 K, for 1 bar H2 overpressure. Our results indicate
   that there are many novel CTMH compounds that are thermodynamically
   stable, and the computed thermodynamic data and phase diagrams should be
   useful for selecting materials and operating parameters for high
   temperature metal hydride applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol-cloud interactions are affected by the rate at which water vapor
   condenses onto particles during cloud droplet growth. Changes in droplet
   growth rates can impact cloud droplet number and size distribution. The
   current study investigated droplet growth kinetics of acidic and neutral
   sulfate particles which contained various amounts and types of organic
   compounds, from model compounds (carbonyls) to complex mixtures
   (a-pinene secondary organic aerosol and diesel engine exhaust). In most
   cases, the formed droplet size distributions were shifted to smaller
   sizes relative to control experiments (pure sulfate particles), due to
   suppression in droplet growth rates in the cloud condensation nuclei
   counter. The shift to smaller droplets correlated with increasing
   amounts of organic material, with the largest effect observed for acidic
   seed particles at low relative humidity. For all organics incorporated
   onto acidic particles, formation of high molecular weight compounds was
   observed, probably by acid-catalyzed Aldol condensation reactions in the
   case of carbonyls. To test the reversibility of this process, carbonyl
   experiments were conducted with acidic particles exposed to higher
   relative humidity. High molecular weight compounds were not measured in
   this case and no shift in droplet sizes was observed, suggesting that
   high molecular weight compounds are the species affecting the rate of
   water uptake. While these results provide laboratory evidence that
   organic compounds can slow droplet growth rates, the modeled mass
   accommodation coefficient of water on these particles (alpha > 0.1)
   indicates that this effect is unlikely to significantly affect cloud
   properties, consistent with infrequent field observations of slower
   droplet growth rates.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropsychological and brain imaging studies have demonstrated
   persistent deficits in memory functions and structural changes after
   neonatal neurotoxic hippocampal lesion in monkeys. However, the relevant
   microstructural changes in the white matter of affected brain regions
   following this early insult remain unknown. This study assessed white
   matter integrity in the main hippocampal projections of adult macaque
   monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions, using diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI). Data analysis was performed using tract-based spatial
   statistics (TBSS) and compared with volume of interest statistics.
   Alterations of fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity indices were
   observed in fornix, temporal stem, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
   optical radiations. To further validate the lesion effects on the
   prefrontal cortex, probabilistic diffusion tractography was used to
   examine the integrity of the fiber connections between hippocampus and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and alterations were found in these
   connections. In addition, increased radial diffusivity in the left
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated negatively with the severity
   of deficits in working memory in the same monkeys. The findings revealed
   microstructural changes due to neonatal hippocampal lesion, and
   confirmed that neonatal neurotoxic hippocampal lesions resulted in
   significant and enduring functional alterations in the hippocampal
   projection system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Upper and lower respiratory infections are common in early childhood and
   may be exacerbated by air pollution. We investigated short-term changes
   in ambient air pollutant concentrations, including speciated particulate
   matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5), in relation to emergency
   department (ED) visits for respiratory infections in young children.
   Daily counts of ED visits for bronchitis and bronchiolitis (n = 80,399),
   pneumonia (n = 63,359), and upper respiratory infection (URI) (n =
   359,246) among children 0-4 years of age were collected from hospitals
   in the Atlanta, Georgia, area for the period 1993-2010. Daily pollutant
   measurements were combined across monitoring stations using population
   weighting. In Poisson generalized linear models, 3-day moving average
   concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and the organic carbon
   fraction of particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5)
   were associated with ED visits for pneumonia and URI. Ozone associations
   were strongest and were observed at low (cold-season) concentrations; a
   1-interquartile range increase predicted a 4\% increase (95\% confidence
   interval: 2\%, 6\%) in visits for URI and an 8\% increase (95\%
   confidence interval: 4\%, 13\%) in visits for pneumonia. Rate ratios
   tended to be higher in the 1- to 4-year age group compared with infants.
   Results suggest that primary traffic pollutants, ozone, and the organic
   carbon fraction of PM2.5 exacerbate upper and lower respiratory
   infections in early life, and that the carbon fraction of PM2.5 is a
   particularly harmful component of the ambient particulate matter
   mixture.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion-based communication refers to the transfer of information
   using molecules as message carriers whose propagation is governed by the
   laws of molecular diffusion. It has been identified that diffusion-based
   communication is one of the most promising solutions for end-to-end
   communication between nanoscale devices. In this paper, the design of a
   diffusion-based communication system considering stochastic signaling,
   arbitrary orders of channel memory, and noisy reception is proposed. The
   diffusion in the cases of one, two, and three dimensions are all
   considered. Three signal processing techniques for the molecular
   concentration with low computational complexity are proposed. For the
   detector design, both a low-complexity one-shot optimal detector for
   mutual information maximization and a near Maximum Likelihood (ML)
   sequence detector are proposed. To the best of our knowledge, our paper
   is the first that gives an analytical treatment of the signal
   processing, estimation, and detection problems for diffusion-based
   communication in the presence of ISI and reception noise. Numerical
   results indicate that the proposed signal processing technique followed
   by the one-shot detector achieves near-optimal throughput without the
   need of a priori information in both short-range and long-range
   diffusion-based communication scenarios, which suggests an ML sequence
   detector is not necessary. Furthermore, the proposed receiver design
   guarantees diffusion-based communication to operate without failure even
   in the case of infinite channel memory. A channel capacity of 1 bit per
   channel utilization can be ultimately achieved by extending the duration
   of the signaling interval.}},

Abstract = {{A novel microwave photonics technique that enables the modulation of
   orthogonal optical single-sideband (OSSB) by using an improved
   Sagnac-loop-based modulator is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.
   The dual-driving Mach-Zehnder modulator and polarization-maintaining
   fiber Bragg grating are integrated inside and outside the Sagnac loop,
   respectively, in order to realize the OSSB modulation and
   polarization-selective filtering. Therefore, the precisely defined
   orthogonal OSSB signal can be generated steadily at 20-GHz carrier
   frequency in the experiment.}},

Volume = {{266}},
Pages = {{332-340}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks in a fuel cell
   vehicle can be inevitably exposed to harsh environments such as cold
   weather in winter, causing water flooding by the direct flow of
   condensed water to the electrodes. In this study, anode flooding was
   experimentally investigated with condensed water generated by cooling
   the anode gas line during a long-term operation (similar to 1600 h). The
   results showed that the performance of the PEMFC was considerably
   degraded. After the long-term experiment, the thickness of the anode
   decreased, and the ratio of Pt to carbon in the anode increased.
   Moreover, repeated fuel starvation of the half-cell severely oxidized
   the carbon surface due to the high induced potential (>1.5 VRHE). The
   cyclic voltammogram of the anode in the half-cell experiments indicated
   that the characteristic feature of the oxidized carbon surface was
   similar to that of the anode in the single cell under anode flooding
   conditions during the long-term experiment Therefore, repeated fuel
   starvation by anode flooding caused severe carbon corrosion in the anode
   because the electrode potential locally increased to >1.0 VRHE.
   Consequently, the density of the tri-phase boundary decreased due to the
   corrosion of carbons supporting the Pt nanoparticles in the anode. (C)

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{We present a crowding-based model to predict the shear viscosity of
   suspensions of rigid bimodal-sized particles. In this model, the mutual
   crowding factor is defined to explicitly account for the change in the
   amount of fluid trapped in the interstices formed by particles upon
   mixing particles with two different sizes. Through this factor, we
   cancel the effect of size interference by mapping the bimodal
   suspensions to a suspension of noninterfering size ratio. This approach
   provides a set of decorrelated particle fractions that depend on
   crowding and size distribution. The shear viscosity of the resultant
   suspension is then directly estimated based on the viscosity of
   corrected components using a stiffening function that accounts for the
   self-crowding in each size class individually. We tested the proposed
   model against published experiments over a wide range of particle volume
   fractions, and we observe an excellent agreement.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{45}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{An AC magnetic field, which is a carrier of information, is distributed
   everywhere and is continuous. How to use and detect this field has been
   an ongoing topic over the past few decades. Conventional magnetic
   sensors are usually based on the Hall Effect, the fluxgate, a
   superconductor quantum interface or magnetoelectric or magnetoresistive
   sensing. Here, a flexible, simple, low-cost and self-powered active
   piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) is successfully demonstrated as an AC
   magnetic field sensor at room temperature. The amplitude and frequency
   of a magnetic field can both be accurately sensed by the NG. The output
   voltage of the NG has a good linearity with a measured magnetic field.
   The detected minute magnetic field is as low as 1.2 x 10(-7) tesla,
   which is 400 times greater than a commercial magnetic sensor that uses
   the Hall Effect. In comparison to the existing technologies, an NG is a
   room-temperature self-powered active sensor that is very simple and very
   cheap for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions of graphene and chemical additives is
   crucial to achieve control over chemically modified graphene materials.
   Here, density functional theory and experiments are used to elucidate
   the chemical bonding of partially fluorinated graphene. This material
   includes FC bonds whose ionicity varies depending upon local
   concentration and structure. Three bonding states dominate. Single
   fluorine on graphene forms a semi-ionic bond with a C atom in an sp(2)
   configuration. Fluorine in highly stable domains of poly(carbon
   fluoride) consists of covalent FC bonds alternating in ortho position
   one to another on both sides of graphene. Fluorine in regions of
   poly(tetracarbon fluoride) has F species on one side of graphene in para
   position one to another, and FC bonds with a character intermediate
   between the semi-ionic and covalent. Such variability in chemical
   bonding could be exploited to tailor fluorinated graphene materials to
   achieve a variety of properties.}},

Abstract = {{Amine-loaded poly(amide-imide) (PAI)/silica hollow fiber sorbents are
   created and used in a rapid temperature swing adsorption (RTSA) system
   for CO2 capture under simulated postcombustion flue gas conditions.
   Poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) is infused into the PAI/mesoporous silica
   hollow fiber sorbents during fiber solvent exchange steps after fiber
   spinning. A lumen-side barrier layer is also successfully formed on the
   bore side of PAI/silica hollow fiber sorbents by using a mixture of
   Neoprene with cross-linking agents in a post-treatment process. The
   amine loaded fibers are tested in shell-and-tube modules by exposure on
   the shell side at 1 atm and 35 degrees C to simulated flue gas with an
   inert tracer (14 mol 96 CO2, 72 mol 96 N-2, and 14 mol \% He, at 100\%
   relative humidity (RH)). The fibers show a breakthrough CO2 capacity of
   0.85 mmol/g-fiber and a pseudoequilibrium CO2 uptake of 1.19
   mmol/g-fiber. When tested in the temperature range of 35-75 degrees C,
   the PAI/silica/PEI fiber sorbents show a maximum CO2 capacity at 65
   degrees C, owing to a trade-off between thermodynamic and kinetic
   factors. To overcome mass transfer limitations in rigidified PEI infused
   in the silica, an alternate PEI infusion method using a
   glycerol/PEI/methanol mixture is developed, and the CO2 sorption
   performance is improved significantly, effectively doubling the
   functional sorption capacity. Specifically, the glycerol-plasticized
   sorbents are found to have a breakthrough and equilibrium CO2 capacity
   of 1.3 and 2.0 mmol/g of dry fiber sorbent at 35 degrees C,
   respectively. Thus, this work demonstrates two PM-based sorbents that
   are optimized for different sorption conditions with the PAI/silica/PEI
   sorbents operating effectively at 65 degrees C and the
   PAI/silica/PEI-glycerol sorbents operating well at 35 degrees C with
   significantly improved sorption capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a newly invented technology
   that is effective for harvesting ambient mechanical energy for portable
   electronics, self-powered sensor networks, etc. Here, by introducing
   segmentation and multilayer integration into the cylindrical TENG, the
   generator's output is enhanced significantly. With a four-layer and
   thirty-segment configuration, the TENG produces a short-circuit current
   of 86 A (13.5 A m(-2)) and power of 4.3 mW (676 mW m(-2)) at a rotating
   speed of 600 rpm, which are respectively over 70 and 15 times higher
   than those of the one-layer and one-segment structure. This makes the
   TENG a sufficient power supply for conventional electronics, such as
   light bulbs and temperature sensors. Furthermore, it is demonstrated
   that the segmentation design is a perfect self-power management
   technique to automatically lower the TENG's output voltage and increase
   its output current without scarifying the output power. The fractal
   geometry is an effective way to maximize the TENG's contact surface area
   and thereby the output performance.}},

Abstract = {{Metal corrosion is universal in the nature and the corrosion prevention
   for metals plays an important role everywhere in national economic
   development and daily life. Here a disk triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG) with segmental structures is introduced as power source to
   achieve a special cathodic protection effect for steels. The output
   transferred charges and short-circuit current density of the TENG
   achieve 1.41 mC/min and 10.1 mA/m(2), respectively, when the rotating
   speed is 1000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The cathodic protection
   potential, Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance
   spectra (EIS) measurements are measured to evaluate the corrosion
   protection effect for the 403 stainless steel (403SS). The cathodic
   protection potential range from -320 mV to -5320 mV is achieved by
   changing rotation speeds and external resistance when the steel is
   coupled in a 0.5 m NaCl solution to the negative pole of the disk TENG.
   The corrosion tests results indicate that the TENG can produce 59.1\%
   degree of protection for Q235 steels in 0.5 m NaCl solution.
   Furthermore, an application of marine corrosion prevention is presented
   by mounting the TENG onto a buoy. This work demonstrates a versatile,
   cost-effect and self-powered system to scavenging mechanical energy from
   environment, leading to effectively protect the metal corrosion without
   additional power sources.}},

Abstract = {{Experimentally refined crystal structures for metalorganic frameworks
   (MOFs) often include solvent molecules and partially occupied or
   disordered atoms. This creates a major impediment to applying
   high-throughput computational screening to MOFs. To address this
   problem, we have constructed a database of MOF structures that are
   derived from experimental data but are immediately suitable for
   molecular simulations. The computation-ready, experimental (CoRE) MOF
   database contains over 4700 porous structures with publically available
   atomic coordinates. Important physical and chemical properties including
   the surface area and pore dimensions are reported for these structures.
   To demonstrate the utility of the database, we performed grand canonical
   Monte Carlo simulations of methane adsorption on all structures in the
   CoRE MOF database. We investigated the structural properties of the CoRE
   MOFs that govern methane storage capacity and found that these
   relationships agree well with those derived recently from a large
   database of hypothetical MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{In medicine, nanotechnology has sparked a rapidly growing interest as it
   promises to solve a number of issues associated with conventional
   therapeutic agents, including their poor water solubility (at least, for
   most anticancer drugs), lack of targeting capability, nonspecific
   distribution, systemic toxicity, and low therapeutic index. Over the
   past several decades, remarkable progress has been made in the
   development and application of engineered nanoparticles to treat cancer
   more effectively. For example, therapeutic agents have been integrated
   with nanoparticles engineered with optimal sizes, shapes, and surface
   properties to increase their solubility, prolong their circulation
   half-life, improve their biodistribution, and reduce their
   immunogenicity. Nanoparticles and their payloads have also been
   favorably delivered into tumors by taking advantage of the
   pathophysiological conditions, such as the enhanced permeability and
   retention effect, and the spatial variations in the pHvalue.
   Additionally, targeting ligands (e.g., small organic molecules,
   peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids) have been added to the surface
   of nanoparticles to specifically target cancerous cells through
   selective binding to the receptors overexpressed on their surface.
   Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that multiple types of therapeutic
   drugs and/or diagnostic agents (e.g., contrast agents) could be
   delivered through the same carrier to enable combination therapy with a
   potential to overcome multidrug resistance, and real-time readout on the
   treatment efficacy. It is anticipated that precisely engineered
   nanoparticles will emerge as the next-generation platform for cancer
   therapy and many other biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-based carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) with combined micro-and
   mesopores are prepared by an advantageous sacrificial templating
   approach using poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) spheres as the pore
   forming material. Resulting CDCs reveal uniform pore size and pore shape
   with a specific surface area of 2434 m(2) g(-1) and a total pore volume
   as high as 2.64 cm(3) g(-1). The bimodal CDC material is a highly
   attractive host structure for the active material in lithium-sulfur
   (Li-S) battery cathodes. It facilitates the utilization of high molarity
   electrolytes and therefore the cells exhibit good rate performance and
   stability. The cathodes in the 5 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)
   imide (LiTFSI) electrolyte show the highest discharge capacities (up to
   1404 mA h g(s)(-1)) and capacity retention (72\% after 50 cycles at

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Propionic acid (PA) is an important platform chemical in the food,
   agriculture, and pharmaceutical industries and is mainly biosynthesized
   by propionibacteria. Acid tolerance in PA-producing strains is crucial.
   In previous work, we investigated the acid tolerance mechanism of
   Propionibacterium acidipropionici at microenvironmental levels by
   analyzing physiological changes in the parental strain and three
   PA-tolerant mutants obtained by genome shuffling. However, the molecular
   mechanism of PA tolerance in P. acidipropionici remained unclear. Here,
   we performed a comparative proteomics study of P. acidipropionici CGMCC
   1.2230 and the acid-tolerant mutant P. acidipropionici WSH1105;
   MALDI-TOF/MS identified 24 proteins that significantly differed between
   the parental and shuffled strains. The differentially expressed proteins
   were mainly categorized as key components of crucial biological
   processes and the acid stress response. Quantitative reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm
   differential expression of nine key proteins. Overexpression of the
   secretory protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP
   synthase subunit a in Escherichia coli BL21 improved PA and acetic acid
   tolerance; overexpression of NADH dehydrogenase and methylmalonyl-CoA
   epimerase improved PA tolerance. These results provide new insights into
   the acid tolerance of P. acidipropionici and will facilitate the
   development of PA production through fermentation by propionibacteria.}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{When mechanical factors underlie growth, development, disease or
   healing, they often function through local regions of tissue where
   deformation is highly concentrated. Current optical techniques to
   estimate deformation can lack precision and accuracy in such regions due
   to challenges in distinguishing a region of concentrated deformation
   from an error in displacement tracking. Here, we present a simple and
   general technique for improving the accuracy and precision of strain
   estimation and an associated technique for distinguishing a concentrated
   deformation from a tracking error. The strain estimation technique
   improves accuracy relative to other state-of-the-art algorithms by
   directly estimating strain fields without first estimating
   displacements, resulting in a very simple method and low computational
   cost. The technique for identifying local elevation of strain enables
   for the first time the successful identification of the onset and
   consequences of local strain concentrating features such as cracks and
   tears in a highly strained tissue. We apply these new techniques to
   demonstrate a novel hypothesis in prenatal wound healing. More
   generally, the analytical methods we have developed provide a simple
   tool for quantifying the appearance and magnitude of localized
   deformation from a series of digital images across a broad range of
   disciplines.}},

Title = {{Effects of stretch induced softening to the free recovery behavior of
   shape memory polymer composites}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{23, SI}},
Pages = {{5938-5947}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{During a cyclic tension test, many elastomeric materials exhibit an
   appreciable softening in their mechanical properties resulting from the
   previous stretch, known as the Mullins effect. This paper explores the
   influence of the stretch induced softening effect to the free recovery
   behavior of an acrylate shape memory polymer (SMP) composite by
   incorporating carbon black (CB) as filler materials. The observed
   softening effect in this SMP composite is considered to be a consequence
   of stretch induced alternation of filler polymer interactions inside the
   composite. Further experiments find that a larger prior stretch gives a
   larger increase in material softening, which in turn decreases the shape
   recovery speed. To capture the experimental observations, a multi-branch
   one dimensional (1D) model is applied, where the modulus in the
   equilibrium branch is modeled to decrease with stretching deformation
   following a damage-like softening function. It is found that the loss in
   modulus due to softening consequently reduces the driving force for
   recovery and thus results in a slow recovery. Parametric studies further
   demonstrate that the discounted shape recovery speed will finally reach
   a saturated level when gradually increasing the programmed strain level
   in a shape memory cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present comparative micromechanical characterization of several

   and bulk material of the different lens. In addition, we have studied
   topography and mechanical properties of the lens surfaces, which come
   into direct contact with the surface of the eye and eyelid. AFM images
   show high contrast distribution maps for the adhesive and mechanical
   properties of the different microstructured regions such as pores,
   lamellae and different material inclusions within the lenses. Additional

   micromechanical properties from different regions within the lens

Abstract = {{This work aims to improve the performance of air-breathing microbial
   fuel cells (MFCs) through using hydrocarbon polymer based nanocomposite
   proton exchange membranes. Accordingly, nanocomposite membranes based on
   sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and montmorillonite (MMT)
   were investigated for such an application. Although the incorporation of
   MMT into SPEEK membranes resulted in reduced oxygen permeability as well
   as proton conductivity, but the overall selectivity was found to be
   improved. MFC tests revealed that using the optimized nanocomposite
   membrane (SPEEK-70/MMT-3 wt \%) results in a considerably higher open
   circuit voltage (OCV) compared to the corresponding neat membrane.
   Moreover, it was found that the SPEEK-70/MMT-3 wt\% membrane is able to
   provide about 40\% more power output than Nafion (R) 117. On the account
   of high proton conductivity, low oxygen permeability, high
   electrochemical performance, ease of preparation and low cost,
   hydrocarbon based nanocomposite PEMs could be considered as promising
   electrolytes to enhance the performance of MFCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigated simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography
   designs for purifying lanthanides (Ln) and actinides (An). SMB is a
   technique where chromatographic columns are arranged in a
   semi-closed-loop manner to separate feed into two product streams
   efficiently with minimal use of the eluent. Using neodymium (Nd) and
   samarium (Sm) as representative Ln elements and surrogates for minor
   actinides such as americium (Am) and curium (Cm), we investigated SMB
   designs with the Reillex HPQ.im resin. Using a chromatographic column
   packed with the resin, model parameters for the SMB design were obtained
   from the UV-VIS responses of pulse injections of the pure components.
   The mobile phase used was 0.5-3.0 M nitric acid. A mathematical model
   based optimization was used to theoretically predict the optimal
   purification rates for an equimolar mixture of the two components
   resulting in product purities of up to 99.5\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   alpha-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA), 4-fluorobenzoicacid (p-FBA) and

   chemical method. Their thermal stabilities were compared through
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and high temperature photoluminescence
   measurements. The results indicated that {[}Sm(p-FBA)(3)Phen](2)
   presented the best thermal stability, and the photoluminescence
   intensity could remain 50\% even after being heat-treated at 280 degrees
   C for 20 min. Not only the rigidity of the organic ligand and complexes
   structures, but also the coordinating ability between rare earth ions
   and ligand played a crucial role in the stability of the complexes. In
   this article, p-fluorobenzoicacid has been proven to be a promising
   ligand for the preparation of highly luminescent and stable rare earth

Abstract = {{Clinical medicine and public health would benefit from simplified
   acquisition of biological samples from patients that can be easily
   obtained at point of care, in the field, and by patients themselves.
   Microneedle patches are designed to serve this need by collecting dermal
   interstitial fluid containing biomarkers without the dangers, pain, or
   expertise needed to collect blood. This study presents novel methods to
   collect biomarker analytes from microneedle patches for analysis by
   integration into conventional analytical laboratory microtubes and
   microplates. Microneedle patches were made out of cross-linked hydrogel
   composed of poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid) and poly(ethylene
   glycol) prepared by micromolding. Microneedle patches were shown to
   swell with water up to 50-fold in volume, depending on degree of polymer
   cross-linking, and to collect interstitial fluid from the skin of rats.
   To collect analytes from microneedle patches, the patches were mounted
   within the cap of microcentrifuge tubes or formed the top of V-bottom
   multiwell microplates, and fluid was collected in the bottom of the
   tubes under gentle centrifugation. In another method, microneedle
   patches were attached to form the bottom of multiwell microplates,
   thereby enabling in situ analysis. The simplicity of biological sample
   acquisition using microneedle patches coupled with the simplicity of
   analyte collection from microneedles patches integrated into
   conventional analytical equipment could broaden the reach of future
   screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of biomarkers in healthcare and
   environmental/workplace settings.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Regional subpapillary myocardial hypokinesis may impair
   lateral reduction in the interpapillary muscle distance (IPMD) from
   diastole to systole, and adversely affect mitral valve geometry and
   tethering.
   OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of
   impaired lateral shortening in the interpapillary muscle distance on
   mitral valve geometry and function in ischemic heart disease.
   METHODS To quantify ventricular size/shape, regional myocardial
   contraction, lateral shortening of the IPMD, mitral valve geometry, and
   severity of mitral regurgitation, 67 patients with ischemic heart
   disease underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and a correlation
   analysis of measured parameters was performed. The impact of reduced
   IPMD shortening on mitral valve (dys) function was confirmed in swine
   and in a physiological computational mitral valve model.
   RESULTS Lateral shortening of the IPMD from diastole to systole was
   severely reduced in patients with moderate/severe ischemic mitral
   regurgitation (9.6 +/- 2.8 mm), but preserved in mild IMR (11.5 +/- 3.4
   mm). Left ventricular size and ejection fraction did not differ between
   the groups. In swine with subpapillary infarction and impaired IPMD,
   mitral regurgitation was evident within 1 week, compared to those pigs
   with a nonpapillary infarction and preserved IPMD. In the controlled
   computational valve model, IPMD had the maximal impact on regurgitation,
   and was exacerbated with additional annular dilation.
   CONCLUSIONS By using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in humans, we
   demonstrated that it is the impairment of lateral shortening between the
   papillary muscles, and not passive ventricular size, that governs the
   severity of mitral regurgitation. Loss of lateral shortening of IPMD
   tethers the leaflet edges and impairs their systolic closure, resulting
   in mitral regurgitation, even in small ventricles. Understanding the
   lateral dynamics of ventricular-valve interactions could aid the
   development of new repair techniques for ischemic mitral regurgitation.

Title = {{Biomechanics and Inflammation in Atherosclerotic Plaque Erosion and
   Plaque Rupture: Implications for Cardiovascular Events in Women}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Although plaque erosion causes approximately 40\% of all
   coronary thrombi and disproportionally affects women more than men, its
   mechanism is not well understood. The role of tissue mechanics in plaque
   rupture and regulation of mechanosensitive inflammatory proteins is well
   established, but their role in plaque erosion is unknown. Given obvious
   differences in morphology between plaque erosion and rupture, we
   hypothesized that inflammation in general as well as the association
   between local mechanical strain and inflammation known to exist in
   plaque rupture may not occur in plaque erosion. Therefore, our objective
   was to determine if similar mechanisms underlie plaque rupture and
   plaque erosion.
   Methods and Results: We studied a total of 74 human coronary plaque
   specimens obtained at autopsy. Using lesion-specific computer modeling
   of solid mechanics, we calculated the stress and strain distribution for
   each plaque and determined if there were any relationships with markers
   of inflammation. Consistent with previous studies, inflammatory markers
   were positively associated with increasing strain in specimens with
   rupture and thin-cap fibroatheromas. Conversely, overall staining for
   inflammatory markers and apoptosis were significantly lower in erosion,
   and there was no relationship with mechanical strain. Samples with
   plaque erosion most closely resembled those with the stable phenotype of
   thick-cap fibroatheromas.
   Conclusions: In contrast to classic plaque rupture, plaque erosion was
   not associated with markers of inflammation and mechanical strain. These
   data suggest that plaque erosion is a distinct pathophysiological
   process with a different etiology and therefore raises the possibility
   that a different therapeutic approach may be required to prevent plaque
   erosion.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to present adequate modeling solutions for
   squat and slender RC walls. ASCE41-13 (American Society of Civil
   Engineers) specifies that the aspect ratios of height to width for the
   RC walls affect the hysteresis response. Thus, this study performed
   non-linear analysis subjected to cyclic loading using two different
   macroscopic models: one of macroscopic models represents flexural
   failure of RC walls (Shear Wall Element model) and the other (General
   Wall Element model) reflects diagonal shear failure occurring in the web
   of RC walls. These analytical results were compared to previous
   experimental studies for a slender wall (> aspect ratio of 3.0) and a
   squat wall (= aspect ratio of 1.0). For the slender wall, the difference
   between the two macroscopic models was negligible, but the squat wall
   was significantly affected by parameters for shear behavior in the
   modeling method. For accurate performance evaluation of RC buildings
   with squat walls, it would be reasonable to use macroscopic models that
   give consideration to diagonal shear.}},

Abstract = {{Vinculin helps cells regulate and respond to mechanical forces. It is a
   scaffolding protein that tightly regulates its interactions with
   potential binding partners within adhesive structuresincluding focal
   adhesions that link the cell to the extracellular matrix and adherens
   junctions that link cells to each otherthat physically connect the
   force-generating actin cytoskeleton (CSK) with the extracellular
   environment. This tight control of binding partner interactionmediated
   by vinculin's autoinhibitory head-tail interactionallows vinculin to
   rapidly interact and detach in response to changes in the dynamic forces
   applied through the cell. In doing so, vinculin modulates the structural
   composition of focal adhesions and the cell's ability to generate
   traction forces and adhesion strength. Recent evidence suggests that
   vinculin plays a similar role in regulating the fate and function of
   cell-cell junctions, further underscoring the importance of this
   protein. Using our lab's recent work as a starting point, this
   commentary explores several outstanding questions regarding the nature
   of vinculin activation and its function within focal adhesions and

Abstract = {{Seaports are important drivers of regional economies, and many face
   seismic risks. This study examines whether and how North American
   seaports consider, have engaged in, or have the capacity to effectively
   plan, manage, and mitigate seismic risks. Of particular interest is the
   way in which the evolving public private governance arrangements in
   ports influence risk decision making. Results from a survey of North
   American seaports (N = 61) show that-contrary to expectations-port
   privatization influences seismic planning only indirectly through
   stakeholder influences on decisions, if at all, and ports identify
   optimizing economic development prospects as their primary strategic
   goal, rather than return on investment. Although seismic hazard is
   predictive of seismic planning, some higher-hazard ports report no plans
   to assess seismic vulnerability and report informal or no seismic
   mitigation plans. Further, higher-hazard ports are no more likely than
   lower-hazard ports to prioritize safety enhancements.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. This study tested the hypothesis that highly targeted
   intrastromal delivery of bevacizumab using coated microneedles allows
   dramatic dose sparing compared with subconjunctival and topical delivery
   for treatment of corneal neovascularization.
   METHODS. Stainless steel microneedles 400 mu m in length were coated
   with bevacizumab. A silk suture was placed in the cornea approximately 1
   mm from the limbus to induce corneal neovascularization in the eyes of
   New Zealand white rabbits that were divided into different groups:
   untreated, microneedle delivery, topical eye drop, and subconjunctival
   injection of bevacizumab. All drug treatments were initiated 4 days
   after suture placement and area of neovascularization was measured daily
   by digital photography for 18 days.
   RESULTS. Eyes treated once with 4.4 mu g bevacizumab using microneedles
   reduced neovascularization compared with untreated eyes by 44\% (day
   18). Eyes treated once with 2500 mu g bevacizumab using subconjunctival
   injection gave similar results to microneedle-treated eyes. Eyes treated
   once with 4.4 mu g subconjunctival bevacizumab showed no significant
   effect compared with untreated eyes. Eyes treated with 52,500 mu g
   bevacizumab by eye drops three times per day for 14 days reduced the
   neovascularization area compared with untreated eyes by 6\% (day 18),
   which was significantly less effective than the single microneedle
   treatment. Visual exam and histological analysis showed no observable
   effect of microneedle treatment on corneal transparency or
   microanatomical structure.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study shows that microneedles can target drug delivery
   to corneal stroma in a minimally invasive way and demonstrates effective
   suppression of corneal neovascularization after suture-induced injury
   using a much lower dose compared with conventional methods.}},

Title = {{Targeted Delivery of Antiglaucoma Drugs to the Supraciliary Space Using
   Microneedles}},
Journal = {{INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY \& VISUAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{7387-7397}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that highly targeted
   delivery of antiglaucoma drugs to the supraciliary space by using a
   hollow microneedle allows dramatic dose sparing of the drug compared to
   topical eye drops. The supraciliary space is the most anterior portion
   of the suprachoroidal space, located below the sclera and above the
   choroid and ciliary body.
   METHODS. A single, hollow 33-gauge microneedle, 700 to 800 mu m in
   length, was inserted into the sclera and used to infuse antiglaucoma
   drugs into the supraciliary space of New Zealand white rabbits (N = 3-6
   per group). Sulprostone, a prostaglandin analog, and brimonidine, an
   alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, were delivered via supraciliary and topical
   administration at various doses. The drugs were delivered unilaterally,
   and intraocular pressure (IOP) of both eyes was measured by rebound
   tonometry for 9 hours after injection to assess the pharmacodynamic
   responses. To assess safety of the supraciliary injection, IOP change
   immediately after intravitreal and supraciliary injection were compared.
   RESULTS. Supraciliary delivery of both sulprostone and brimonidine
   reduced IOP by as much as 3 mm Hg bilaterally in a dose-related
   response; comparison with topical administration at the conventional
   human dose showed approximately 100-fold dose sparing by supraciliary
   injection for both drugs. A safety study showed that the kinetics of IOP
   elevation immediately after supraciliary and intravitreal injection of
   placebo formulations were similar.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study introduced the use of targeted drug delivery to
   the supraciliary space by using a microneedle and demonstrated dramatic
   dose sparing of antiglaucoma therapeutic agents compared to topical eye
   drops. Targeted delivery in this way can increase safety by reducing
   side effects and could allow a single injection to contain enough drug
   for long-term sustained delivery.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{409-422}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Public transit agencies often struggle with service reliability issues;
   when a bus does not arrive on time, passengers become frustrated and may
   be less likely to choose transit for future trips. To address
   reliability issues, transit authorities have begun to provide real-time
   information (RTI) to riders via mobile and web-enabled devices. The
   objective of this research is to quantify the benefits of RTI provided
   to bus riders. The method used is a behavioral experiment with a
   before-after control group design in which RTI is only provided to the
   experimental group. Web-based surveys are used to measure behavior,
   feeling, and satisfaction changes of bus riders in Tampa, Florida over a
   study period of approximately three months.
   The results show that the primary benefits associated with providing RTI
   to passengers pertain to waiting at the bus stop. Analysis of
   ``usual{''} wait times revealed a significantly larger decrease (nearly
   2 min) for RTI users compared to the control group. Additionally, RTI
   users had significant decreases in levels of anxiety and frustration
   when waiting for the bus compared to the control group. Similarly, they
   had significant increases in levels of satisfaction with the time they
   spend waiting for the bus and how often the bus arrives at the stop on
   time. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that RTI
   significantly improves the passenger experience of waiting for the bus,
   which is notoriously one of the most disliked elements of transit trips.
   The frequency of bus trips and bus-to-bus transfers were also evaluated
   during the study period, but there were no significant differences
   between the experimental and control groups. This is not surprising
   since the majority of bus riders in Tampa are transit-dependent and lack
   other transportation alternatives.
   The primary contribution of this research is a comprehensive evaluation
   of the passenger benefits of RTI conducted in a controlled environment.
   Moreover, this research has immediate implications for public transit
   agencies - particularly those serving largely transit-dependent
   populations - facing pressure to improve service under tight budget
   constraints. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The 2011-2012 unrest of Santorini (Thera) volcano (Aegean Sea, Greece)
   was associated with microseismicity confined to the Kameni Line (KL), a
   major tectonovolcanic lineament, and has been regarded as a single
   magmatic episode, produced by a spherical source derived from inversion
   of GPS data. However, such a source is a few kilometers away from the KL
   and cannot explain observed microseismicity. For this reason, we divided
   the unrest episode into five periods based on the fluctuations of
   seismicity and deformation rates and investigated the connection between
   seismicity and two spherical magmatic point sources for each period.
   Based on a new inversion algorithm and consistent GPS data, we
   recognized during the volcano unrest episode an unstable pattern of
   intrusions correlating with both the KL and Columbo Line (CL), a second
   major tectonovolcanic lineament. Intrusions correlating with CL appear
   relatively persistent, aseismic, small, and shallow, which is consistent
   with marine geophysical evidence for arrested shallow dykes and geodetic
   evidence from a previous inflation episode. During the two periods of
   intense seismicity, sources close to the KL, explaining seismicity, were
   obtained. This unstable pattern of intrusions explains both the
   well-observed location and timing of seismicity as well as ground
   deformation and is consistent with results of an Okada-type inversion
   for a sill and a dyke. The stress interactions between the two sources
   agree with Coulomb failure stress models. Santorini appears to be
   affected by concurrent offset magma pulses, and only recent activity
   from a magma pulse below the KL produced microseismic swarms.}},

Abstract = {{A multistudy approach is presented that allows design thinking of
   complex systems to be studied by triangulating causal controlled lab
   findings with coded data from more complex products. A case study
   illustration of this approach is provided. During the conceptual design
   of engineering systems, designers face many cognitive challenges,
   including design fixation, errors in their mental models, and the sunk
   cost effect. These factors need to be mitigated for the generation of
   effective ideas. Understanding the effects of these challenges in a
   realistic and complex engineering system is especially difficult due to
   a variety of factors influencing the results. Studying the design of
   such systems in a controlled environment is extremely challenging
   because of the scale and complexity of such systems and the time needed
   to design the systems. Considering these challenges, a mixed-method
   approach is presented for studying the design thinking of complex
   engineering systems. This approach includes a controlled experiment with
   a simple system and a qualitative cognitive-artifacts study on more
   complex engineering systems followed by the triangulation of results.
   The triangulated results provide more generalizable information for
   complex system design thinking. This method combines the advantages of
   quantitative and qualitative study methods, making them more powerful
   while studying complex engineering systems. The proposed method is
   illustrated further using an illustrative study on the cognitive effects
   of physical models during the design of engineering systems.}},

Abstract = {{Flow cytometry is able to measure the expressions of multiple proteins
   simultaneously at the single-cell level. A flow cytometry experiment on
   one biological sample provides measurements of several protein markers
   on or inside a large number of individual cells in that sample. Analysis
   of such data often aims to identify subpopulations of cells with
   distinct phenotypes. Currently, the most widely used analytical approach
   in the flow cytometry community is manual gating on a sequence of nested
   biaxial plots, which is highly subjective, labor intensive, and not
   exhaustive. To address those issues, a number of methods have been
   developed to automate the gating analysis by clustering algorithms.
   However, completely removing the subjectivity can be quite challenging.
   This paper describes an alternative approach. Instead of automating the
   analysis, we develop novel visualizations to facilitate manual gating.
   The proposed method views single-cell data of one biological sample as a
   high-dimensional point cloud of cells, derives the skeleton of the
   cloud, and unfolds the skeleton to generate 2D visualizations. We
   demonstrate the utility of the proposed visualization using real data,
   and provide quantitative comparison to visualizations generated from
   principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling.}},

Abstract = {{Stability and sensitivity analyses of biological systems require the ad
   hoc writing of computer code, which is highly dependent on the
   particular model and burdensome for large systems. We propose a very
   accurate strategy to overcome this challenge. Its core concept is the
   conversion of the model into the format of biochemical systems theory
   (BST), which greatly facilitates the computation of sensitivities.
   First, the steady state of interest is determined by integrating the
   model equations toward the steady state and then using a Newton-Raphson
   method to fine-tune the result. The second step of conversion into the
   BST format requires several instances of numerical differentiation. The
   accuracy of this task is ensured by the use of a complex-variable Taylor
   scheme for all differentiation steps. The proposed strategy is
   implemented in a new software program, COSMOS, which automates the
   stability and sensitivity analysis of essentially arbitrary ODE models
   in a quick, yet highly accurate manner. The methods underlying the
   process are theoretically analyzed and illustrated with four
   representative examples: a simple metabolic reaction model; a model of
   aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis; a TCA-cycle model; and a
   modified TCA-cycle model. COSMOS has been deposited to
   https://github.com/BioprocessdesignLab/COSMOS.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic liquids are of potential interest in the processing of

   system of 1-methylimidazole (MIM) and 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium

   black liquor obtained from a kraft paper mill. Lignin
   ethanol-precipitated (LEP) and ethanol-soluble (LES) fractions were
   characterized via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and C-13- and
   P-31-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to determine
   structural characteristics and their relationship to polymer solubility
   in the system. Polymer integrity and solubility were optimal at -20\%
   lignin loading (w/w). Results showed that LEPs were generally of higher
   apparent molecular weight (Mw) and enriched with condensed/aliphatic
   ether linkages and aliphatic hydroxyls. The LESs had a lower apparent Mw
   and were enriched with carboxylic and phenolic groups. This newly gained
   knowledge on lignin fractionation and aggregation in the present solvent
   system provides future opportunities for tuning fractionation/extraction
   to suit a specific biomass-derived product, e.g., carbon fibers.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous paper, conceptual process design, simulation, and mass and
   energy balances were presented for an organosolv process with a hardwood
   feed of 2350 metric tons (MT) per day and ethanol, lignin, furfural, and
   acetic acid production rates of 459, 310, 6.6, and 30.3 MT/day,
   respectively. In this paper, the investment and operating costs of the
   process and the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) to make the process
   economically feasible were estimated. The total capital investment of
   the plant was approximately 720 million USD. Lignin price was found to
   affect the MESP considerably. With a base case lignin price of 450
   USD/MT, the MESP was approximately 3.1 USD per gallon (gal). Higher
   lignin price of 1000 USD/MT was required to equal the MESP with the
   December 2013 ethanol market price (2.0 USD/gal). In addition to lignin
   price, the MESP was found to be strongly affected by feedstock, enzyme,
   and investment costs. Variations in feedstock and investment costs
   affected the MESP by approximately 0.2 and 0.5 USD/gal, respectively.
   Changing the enzyme dosage and price from base case estimate of 5270
   USD/MT and 0.02 g/g cellulose to more conservative 3700 USD/MT and 0.06
   g/g cellulose, respectively, increased the MESP by 0.59 USD/gal.}},

Title = {{Individuals with transtibial limb loss use interlimb force asymmetries
   to maintain multi-directional reactive balance control}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1039-1047}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deficits in balance control are one of the most common and
   serious mobility challenges facing individuals with lower limb loss.
   Yet, dynamic postural balance control among individuals with lower limb
   loss remains poorly understood. Here we examined the kinematics and
   kinetics of dynamic balance in individuals with unilateral transtibial
   limb loss.
   Methods: Five individuals with unilateral transtibial limb loss, and
   five age- and gender-matched controls completed a series of randomly
   applied multi-directional support surface translations. Whole-body
   metrics, e.g. peak center-of-mass displacement and net
   center-of-pressure displacement were compared across cohorts. Stability
   margin was computed as the difference between peak center-of-pressure
   and center-of-mass displacement. Additionally, center-of-pressure and
   ground reaction force magnitude and direction were compared between the
   prosthetic, intact, and control legs.
   Findings: Peak center-of-mass displacement and stability margin did not
   differ between individuals with transtibial limb loss and controls for
   all perturbation directions except those loading only the prosthetic
   leg: in such cases the stability margin was actually larger than
   controls. Despite similar center-of-mass displacement, greater
   center-of-pressure displacement was observed in the intact leg during
   anterior-posterior perturbations, and under the prosthetic leg in
   medial-lateral perturbations. Further, in the prosthetic leg, ground
   reaction forces were smaller and spanned fewer directions.
   Interpretation: Deficits in balance control among individuals with
   transtibial limb loss may be due to their inability to use their
   prosthetic leg to generate forces that are equal in magnitude and
   direction to those of unimpaired adults. Targeting this force-generating
   deficit through technological or rehabilitation innovations may improve
   balance control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flush atmospheric data systems take measurements of the pressure
   distribution on the forebodies of vehicles and improve the estimate of
   freestream parameters during reconstruction. These systems have been
   present on many past entry vehicles, but design of the pressure
   transducer suites and the placement of the sensors on the vehicle
   forebody have largely relied on engineering judgment and heuristic
   techniques. This paper develops a flush atmospheric data system design
   methodology using Cramer-Rao lower-bound optimization to define the
   smallest theoretical variance possible from the estimation process.
   Application of this methodology yields Pareto frontiers of possible
   optimal configurations and identifies the number of ports that serve as
   the point of diminishing returns. The methodology is tested with a
   simulated Mars entry, descent, and landing trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion is a large damage for industry, infrastructure and transport
   equipments such as vehicle and freighter. If the energies in environment
   can be harvested into electricity for the prevention of corrosion, it
   will be very valuable. Here, we enhanced the property of triboelectric
   nanogenerator and designed a self-powered anticorrosion system to
   protect iron from corrosion. Nanostructures fabricated through a simple
   method and prior-charge injection into the space between the surface of
   the friction layers and the electrodes were used to greatly enhance the
   property of triboelectric nanogenerator. The charge density was
   increased by 48\% owing to the nanostructure and further increased by
   53\% owing to the prior-charge injection process. The output
   open-circuit voltage reached 1008 V, the short-circuit current density
   reached 32.1 mA/m(2) and the charge density reached 121 mu C/m(2). On
   the basis of this high performance TENG, we developed a self-powered
   anticorrosion system to successfully protect a piece of iron sheet
   soaked in saline water from corrosion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   98.3\% after 11,000 cycles of charge and discharge. Extremely small
   relaxation time constants of 1.9 ms in aqueous electrolyte and 4.8 ms in
   gelled electrolyte are achieved. Also the device shows great flexibility

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A practical self-powered velocity sensor based on the principles of a
   triboelectric generator for either rectified linear or rotary motion is
   presented. The effort represents the first successful attempt in
   integrating a triboelectric generator into a commercial digital circuit
   for the dual-mode speed sensing. Employing alternating Kapton-copper
   strips arranged in a spiral configuration wrapped on the inner and outer
   surfaces of two concentric cylinders, voltage assays for linear and
   rotary motions can be measured without the need for an external power
   source. The triboelectric generated output signals when integrated with
   a digital circuit and a microcontroller unit can be directly processed
   into remarkably stable, macro-scale output signals for measurements of
   (0.1-0.6) ms(-1)+0.5\% for linear velocities and (300-700) rpm+0.9\% for
   rotary velocities. We have also discussed the measuring sensitivities
   and limitations of our device in the paper. We believe our pioneering
   demonstration of the applied triboelectric technology will have a huge
   impact in the industrial commercialization of self-powered devices and
   sensors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Noble-metal nanocrystals are essential to applications in a variety of
   areas, including catalysis, electronics, and photonics. Despite the
   large number of reports, there still exists a gap between academic
   studies and industrial applications due to the lack of ability to
   produce the nanocrystals in large quantities while still maintaining the
   good uniformity and precise controls. Because the nucleation and growth
   of colloidal nanocrystals are highly sensitive to experimental
   conditions, it is impractical to scale up their production by simply
   increasing the reaction volume. Here we report a new and practical
   approach based on milliliter-sized droplet reactors to the scalable
   production of nanocrystals. The droplets of 0.25 mL in volume were
   produced as a continuous flow in a fluidic device assembled from
   commercially available components. As a proof of concept, we have
   synthesized Pd, Au, and Pd-M (M = Au, Pt, and Ag) nanocrystals with
   controlled sizes, shapes, compositions, and structures on a scale of
   1-10 g per hour (e.g., 3.6 g per hour for Pd cubes of 10 nm in edge
   length).}},

Abstract = {{The earliest molecular events in T-cell recognition have not yet been
   fully described, and the initial T-cell receptor (TCR)-triggering
   mechanism remains a subject of controversy. Here, using total internal
   reflection/Forster resonance energy transfer microscopy, we observe a
   two-stage interaction between TCR, CD8 and major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC)peptide. There is an early (within seconds) interaction
   between CD3 zeta and the coreceptor CD8 that is independent of the
   binding of CD8 to MHC, but that requires CD8 association with Lck. Later
   (several minutes) CD3 zeta-CD8 interactions require CD8-MHC binding. Lck
   can be found free or bound to the coreceptor. This work indicates that
   the initial TCR-triggering event is induced by free Lck.}},

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communications have been recently proposed as an
   effective way to increase both spectrum and energy efficiency for future
   cellular systems. In this paper, joint mode selection, channel
   assignment, and power control in D2D communications are addressed. We
   aim at maximizing the overall system throughput while guaranteeing the
   signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio of both D2D and cellular links.
   Three communication modes are considered for D2D users: cellular mode,
   dedicated mode, and reuse mode. The optimization problem could be
   decomposed into two subproblems: power control and joint mode selection
   and channel assignment. The joint mode selection and channel assignment
   problem is NP-hard, whose optimal solution can be found by the
   branch-and-bound method, but is very complicated. Therefore, we develop
   low-complexity algorithms according to the network load. Through
   comparing different algorithms under different network loads, proximity
   gain, hop gain, and reuse gain could be demonstrated in D2D
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate Drug Delivery Systems (PDDS) are therapeutic methods that
   use nanoparticles to achieve their healing effects at the exact time,
   concentration level of drug nanoparticles, and location in the body,
   while minimizing the effects on other healthy locations. The Molecular
   Communication (MC) paradigm, where the transmitted message is the drug
   injection process, the channel is the cardiovascular system, and the
   received message is the drug reception process, has been investigated as
   a tool to study nanoscale biological and medical systems in recent
   years. In this paper, the various noise effects that cause uncertainty
   in the cardiovascular system are analyzed, modeled, and evaluated from
   the information theory perspective. Analytical MC noises are presented
   to include all end-to-end noise effects, from the drug injection, to the
   absorption of drug nanoparticles by the diseased cells, in the presence
   of a time-varying and turbulent blood flow. The PDDS capacity is derived
   analytically including all these noise effects and the constraints on
   the drug injection. The proposed MC noise is validated by using the
   kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation technique. Analytical expressions of the
   noise and the capacity are derived, and MC is presented as a framework
   for the optimization of particulate drug delivery systems (PDDS).}},

Title = {{Comparing Multipollutant Emissions-Based Mobile Source Indicators to

Abstract = {{A variety of single pollutant and multipollutant metrics can be used to
   represent exposure to traffic pollutant mixtures and evaluate their
   health effects. Integrated mobile source indicators (IMSIs) that combine
   air quality concentration and emissions data have recently been
   developed and evaluated using data from Atlanta, Georgia. IMSIs were
   found to track trends in traffic-related pollutants and have similar or
   stronger associations with health outcomes. In the current work, we
   apply IMSIs for gasoline, diesel and total (gasoline + diesel) vehicles
   to two other cities (Denver, Colorado and Houston, Texas) with different
   emissions profiles as well as to a different dataset from Atlanta. We
   compare spatial and temporal variability of IMSIs to single-pollutant
   indicators (carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and elemental
   carbon (EC)) and multipollutant source apportionment factors produced by
   Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Across cities, PMF-derived and IMSI
   gasoline metrics were most strongly correlated with CO (r = 0.31-0.98),
   while multipollutant diesel metrics were most strongly correlated with
   EC (r = 0.80-0.98). NOx correlations with PMF factors varied across
   cities (r = 0.29-0.67), while correlations with IMSIs were relatively
   consistent (r = 0.61-0.94). In general, single-pollutant metrics were
   more correlated with IMSIs (r = 0.58-0.98) than with PMF-derived factors
   (r = 0.07-0.99). A spatial analysis indicated that IMSIs were more
   strongly correlated (r > 0.7) between two sites in each city than single
   pollutant and PMF factors. These findings provide confidence that IMSIs
   provide a transferable, simple approach to estimate mobile source air
   pollution in cities with differing topography and source profiles using
   readily available data.}},

Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Lymphatic Filariasis, a Neglected Tropical Disease, is caused by
   thread-like parasitic worms, including B. malayi, which migrate to the
   human lymphatic system following transmission. The parasites reside in
   collecting lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes for years, often resulting
   in lymphedema, elephantiasis or hydrocele. The mechanisms driving worm
   migration and retention within the lymphatics are currently unknown. We
   have developed an integrated in vitro imaging platform capable of
   quantifying B. malayi migration and behavior in a multicellular
   microenvironment relevant to the initial site of worm injection by
   incorporating the worm in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel in
   the presence of human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and
   human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The platform utilizes a motorized
   controllable microscope with CO2 and temperature regulation to allow for
   worm tracking experiments with high resolution over large length and
   time scales. Using post-acquisition algorithms, we quantified four
   parameters: 1) speed, 2) thrashing intensity, 3) percentage of time
   spent in a given cell region and 4) persistence ratio. We demonstrated
   the utility of our system by quantifying these parameters for L3 B.
   malayi in the presence of LECs and HDFs. Speed and thrashing increased
   in the presence of both cell types and were altered within minutes upon
   exposure to the anthelmintic drug, tetramisole. The worms displayed no
   targeted migration towards either cell type for the time course of this
   study (3 hours). When cells were not present in the chamber, worm
   thrashing correlated directly with worm speed. However, this correlation
   was lost in the presence of cells. The described platform provides the
   ability to further study B. malayi migration and behavior.}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Not only is hydrogen critical for current chemical and
   refining processes, it is also projected to be an important energy
   carrier for future green energy systems such as fuel cell vehicles
   Scientists have examined light metal hydrides for this purpose, which
   need to have both good thermodynamic properties and fast
   charging/discharging kinetics. The properties of hydrogen in metals are
   also important in the development of membranes for hydrogen
   purification. In this Account, we highlight our recent work aimed at the
   large scale screening of metal based systems with either favorable
   hydrogen capacities and thermodynamics for hydrogen storage in metal
   hydrides for use in onboard fuel cell vehicles or promising hydrogen
   permeabilities relative to pure Pd for hydrogen separation from high
   temperature mixed gas streams using dense metal membranes.
   Previously, chemists have found that the metal hydrides need to hit a
   stability sweet spot: if the compound is too stable, it will not release
   enough hydrogen under low temperatures; if the compound is too unstable,
   the reaction may not be reversible under practical conditions
   Fortunately, we can use DFT-based methods to assess this stability via
   prediction of thermodynamic properties, equilibrium reaction pathways,
   and phase diagrams for candidate metal hydride systems with reasonable
   accuracy using only proposed crystal structures and compositions as
   inputs. We have efficiently screened millions of mixtures of pure
   metals, metal hydrides, and alloys to identify promising reaction
   schemes via the grand canonical linear programming method.
   Pure Pd and Pd based membranes have ideal hydrogen selectivities over
   other gases but suffer shortcomings such as sensitivity to sulfur
   poisoning and hydrogen embrittlement. Using a combination of detailed
   DFT, Monte Carlo techniques, and simplified models, we are able to
   accurately predict hydrogen permeabilities of metal membranes and screen
   large libraries of candidate alloys, selections of which are described
   in this Account To further increase the number of membrane materials
   that can be studied with DFT, computational costs need to be reduced
   either through methods development to break bottlenecks in the
   performance prediction algorithm, particularly related to transition
   state identification, or through screening techniques that take
   advantage of correlations to bypass constraints.}},

Abstract = {{A novel amine dehydrogenase, F-AmDH, catalyzes the reversible reduction
   of prochiral ketones to chiral amines. However, many targeted
   hydrophobic substrates of F-AmDH show little to no solubility in an
   aqueous medium. The introduction of water-miscible organic solvents was
   unsuccessful because of AmDH deactivation. In a biphasic aqueousorganic
   system, F-AmDH, coupled with formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and
   hydrophilic co-factors are envisioned to remain in the aqueous phase
   while the hydrophobic substrate partitions between the phases. The
   advantages include a larger amount of total substrate present in the
   system, straightforward product removal, and reduced or negligible
   substrate and product inhibition. We succeeded in generating chiral
   amines from hydrophobic substrates that were previously unattainable
   because of the low solubility of the ketone substrate in aqueous medium.
   The partition coefficient played an important role in establishing
   optimal reaction conditions. Specific activity was found to be
   comparable between aqueous and biphasic reaction systems for substrates
   that showed some solubility. Thus, biphasic reaction conditions widen
   the range of substrates for the production of chiral amines using amine
   dehydrogenases.}},

Title = {{Dynamic CO2 Adsorption Performance of Internally Cooled Silica-Supported
   Poly(ethylenimine) Hollow Fiber Sorbents}},
Journal = {{AICHE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic adsorption behavior of CO2 under both nonisothermal and
   nearly isothermal conditions in silica supported poly(ethylenimine)
   (PEI) hollow fiber sorbents (Torlon (R)-S-PEI) is investigated in a
   rapid temperature swing adsorption (RTSA) process. A maximum CO2
   breakthrough capacity of 1.33 mmol/g-fiber (2.66 mmol/g-silica) is
   observed when the fibers are actively cooled by flowing cooling water in
   the fiber bores. Under dry CO2 adsorption conditions, heat released from
   the CO2-amine interaction increases the CO2 breakthrough capacity by
   reducing the severity of the diffusion resistance in the supported PEI.
   This internal resistance can also be alleviated by prehydrating the
   fiber sorbent with a humid N-2 feed. The CO2 breakthrough capacity of
   prehydrated fibers is adversely affected by the release of the
   adsorption enthalpy (unlike the dry fibers); however, active cooling of
   the fiber results in a constant CO2 breakthrough capacity even at high
   CO2 delivery rates (i.e., high adsorption enthalpy delivery rates). In
   full RTSA cycles, a purity of 50\% CO2 is achieved and the adsorption
   enthalpy recovery rate can reach similar to 72\%. Studies on the cyclic
   stability of uncooled fiber sorbents in the presence of SO2 and NO
   contaminants indicate that exposure to NO at 200 ppm over 120 cycles
   does not lead to a significant degradation of the sorbents, but SO2
   exposure at a similar high concentration of 200 ppm causes 60\% loss in
   CO2 breakthrough capacity after 120 cycles. A simple amine reinfusion
   technique is successfully demonstrated to recover the adsorption
   capacity in poisoned fiber sorbents after deactivation by exposure to
   impurities such SO2. (C) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Title = {{Axial pile response of bidirectional O-cell loading from modified

Abstract = {{The Osterberg cell (O-cell) type of bidirectional pile load testing is a
   modern full-scale proofing method in the realm of performance-based pile
   design. It is done at considerable cost, not possible on small-to
   medium-size projects. An economical approach of utilizing the flexible
   and approximate analytical solution proposed by Randolph has frequently
   been adopted in the past for evaluating pile settlements under static,
   unidirectional, top-down axial compression loading. To extend this
   solution for O-cell loadings, the following adaptations are warranted:
   (i) appropriate modifications to handle the loadings in two directions
   and (ii) development of a nonlinear stiffness reduction model, derived
   from the back-analysis of O-cell pile load tests. Accordingly, a
   modified analytical solution is presented for the two common cases of
   O-cell loading arrangements. Using these modified sets of solutions and
   a well-documented database of O-cell load tests on drilled shaft
   foundations from different sites, two stiffness reduction models have
   been developed. The shear wave velocity readings obtained from the
   hybrid geophysical-geotechnical seismic piezocone tests afford the
   evaluation of fundamental shear stiffness modulus (G(max)) profiles.
   These profiles together with the re-arranged modified solution were
   applied to the axial loads versus displacements (Q-w) from the database
   of load tests to back-calculate the applicable operational shear
   stiffness (G) values. Additional sensitivity analyses indicate that pile
   geometry and soil stiffness profile are the two most significant factors
   affecting the outcome of this solution. A comprehensive set of
   step-by-step example calculations is included to explain the procedure
   for implementing the solution.}},

Title = {{Redox processes inform multivariate transdifferentiation trajectories
   associated with TGF beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition}},
Journal = {{FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Phenotype reprogramming during transforming growth factor beta (TCF
   beta)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an extensive
   and dynamic process, orchestrated by the integration of biological
   signaling across multiple time scales. As part of the numerous
   transcriptional changes necessary for EMT, TGF beta-initiated Smad3
   signaling results in remodeling of the redox environment and decreased
   nucleophilic tone. Because Smad3 itself is susceptible to attenuated
   activity through antioxidants, the possibility of a positive feedback
   loop exists, albeit the time scales on which these mechanisms operate
   are quite different. We hypothesized that the decreased nucleophilic
   tone acquired during EMT promotes Smad3 signaling, enhancing acquisition
   and stabilization of the mesenchymal phenotype. Previous findings
   supporting such a mechanism were characterized independent of each
   other; we sought to investigate these relationships within a singular
   experimental context. In this study, we characterized multivariate
   representations of phenotype as they evolved over time, specifically
   measuring expression of epithelial/mesenchymal differentiation, redox
   regulators, and Smad transcription factors. In-cell Western (ICW) assays
   were developed to evaluate multivariate phenotype states as they
   developed during EMT. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted
   anticorrelations between phospho-Smad3 (pSmad3) and Smad2/Smad4, which
   reflected a compensatory up-regulation of Smad2 and Smad4 following
   cessation of TGF beta signaling. Measuring transcript expression
   following EMT, we identified down-regulation of numerous antioxidant
   genes concomitant with up-regulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and
   multiple mesenchymal phenotype markers. TGF beta treatment increased
   CM-H2DCF-DA oxidation, decreased H2O2 degradation rates, and increased
   glutathione redox potential. Our findings suggest that the decreased
   nucleophilic tone during EMT coincides with the acquisition of a
   mesenchymal phenotype over too long a time scale to enable enhanced
   Smad3 phosphorylation during initiation of EMT. We further challenged
   the mesenchymal phenotype following EMT through antioxidant and TGF beta
   inhibitor treatments, which failed to induce a mesenchymal-epithelial
   transition (MET). Our characterization of multivariate phenotype
   dynamics during EMT indicates that the decrease in nucleophilic tone
   occurs alongside EMT: however, maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype
   following EMT is independent of both the nascent redox state and the
   continuous TGF beta signaling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Compliant off-chip interconnects have both in-plane and out-of-plane
   compliance and are able to accommodate the differential deflection
   between the die and the substrate or between the substrate and the
   board, and thus can enhance overall reliability and life of a
   microelectronic system. A TriDelta compliant interconnect is being
   pursued at Georgia Tech as an alternate die-to-substrate or
   substrate-to-board interconnect. It is found that any geometry
   improvement that enhances the mechanical compliance will also adversely
   affect the electrical performance. Thus, the design of a compliant
   interconnect is a tradeoff between the mechanical and electrical
   performances. In this paper, we examine eight design variables to
   balance mechanical and electrical performance metrics of a TriDelta
   interconnect. These design variables are appropriately reduced to four
   and normalized. The method of normalization not only reduces the number
   of the design variables but also makes the response surfaces scalable
   with footprint size. The response surfaces are constructed for
   electrical resistance, inductance, and the von Mises strains using the
   central composite inscribed design points. The method of global
   criterion is used to scalarize this multiobjective optimization problem,
   and an optimization has been done using specified design and processing
   constraints as well as the ranges of the design variables. Based on the
   optimization results, it is seen that the TriDelta compliant
   interconnect geometry can be designed to meet all of the electrical,
   mechanical, and fabrication requirements. The developed methodology is
   applicable to a wide range of other compliant interconnects beyond what
   is presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the analysis and design of saturated
   silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)
   switches for millimeter-wave applications. A switch optimization
   procedure is developed based on detailed theoretical analysis and is
   then used to design multiple switch variants. The switches utilize IBM's
   90-nm 9HP technology, which features SiGe HBTs with peak f(T)/f(max) of
   300/350 GHz. Using a reverse-saturated configuration, a single-pole
   double-throw switch with a measured insertion loss of 1.05 dB and
   isolation of 22 dB is achieved at 94 GHz after de-embedding pad losses.
   The switch draws 5.2 mA from a 1.1-V supply, limiting power consumption
   to less than 6 mW. The switching speed is analyzed and the simulated
   turn-on and turn-off times are found to be less than 200 ps. A technique
   is also introduced to significantly increase the power-handling
   capabilities of saturated SiGe switches up to an input-referred 1-dB
   compression point of 22 dBm. Finally, the impact of RF stress on this
   novel configuration is investigated and initial measurements over a 48-h
   period show little performance degradation. These results demonstrate
   that SiGe-based switches may provide significant benefits to
   millimeter-wave systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of hybrid automatic repeat
   request (HARQ) with incremental redundancy over double Rayleigh
   channels, a common model for the fading amplitude of vehicle-to-vehicle
   communication systems. We investigate the performance of HARQ from an
   information theoretic perspective. Analytical expressions are derived
   for the epsilon-outage capacity, the average number of transmissions,
   and the average transmission rate of HARQ with incremental redundancy
   assuming a maximum number of HARQ rounds. Moreover, we evaluate the
   delay experienced by Poisson arriving packets for HARQ with incremental
   redundancy. We provide analytical expressions for the expected waiting
   time, the packet's sojourn time in the queue, the average consumed
   power, and the energy efficiency. In our study, the communication rate
   per HARQ round is adjusted to the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   such that a target outage probability is not exceeded. This setting
   conforms with communication systems in which a quality of service is
   expected regardless of the channel conditions. Our analysis underscores
   the importance of HARQ in improving the spectral efficiency and
   reliability of communication systems. We demonstrate as well that the
   explored HARQ scheme achieves full diversity. Additionally, we
   investigate the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper derives a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for
   generating resonant waves by two propagating time-harmonic plane waves.
   It is shown that in collinear mixing, a resonant wave can be generated
   either by a pair of longitudinal waves, in which case the resonant
   mixing wave is also a longitudinal wave, or by a pair of longitudinal
   and transverse waves, in which case the resonant wave is a transverse
   wave. In addition, the paper obtains closed-form analytical solutions to
   the resonant waves generated by two collinearly propagating sinusoidal
   pulses. The results show that amplitude of the resonant pulse is
   proportional to the mixing zone size, which is determined by the spatial
   lengths of the input pulses. Finally, numerical simulations based on the
   finite element method and experimental measurements using one-way mixing
   are conducted. It is shown that both numerical and experimental results
   agree well with the analytical solutions. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{We report a hybrid energy cell that can simultaneously or individually
   harvest wind, solar, and chemical energies to power some electronic
   devices. By utilizing the wind driven relative rotations between a
   polytetrafluoroethylene film and an etched Al film attached on two
   acrylic tubes, the fabricated triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can
   deliver an open-circuit voltage of about 90 V, a short-circuit current
   density of about 0.5 mA/m(2), and a maximum power density of 16 mW/m(2),
   which is capable of directly lighting up 20 blue light-emitting-diodes
   (LEDs). By integrating a TENG, a solar cell, and an electrochemical
   cell, a hybrid energy cell has been fabricated to simultaneously
   scavenge three different types of energies. As compared with the
   individual energy units, the hybrid energy cell exhibited much better
   performance in charging a capacitor. Moreover, we also demonstrated that
   the hybrid energies generated can be stored in a Li-ion battery for
   powering a commercial wind speed sensor and a temperature sensor. This
   work represents significant progress toward practical applications of
   hybrid energy cells, providing potential solutions for simultaneously
   scavenging wind, solar, and chemical energies.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of graphene-based nanomaterials has prompted the
   development of flexible nanocomposites for emerging applications in need
   of superior mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, and chemical

   the characteristics of both components if proper structural and
   interfacial organization is achieved. Here, we briefly introduce the
   material designs and basic interfacial interactions in the
   graphene-polymer nanocomposites and the corresponding theoretical models
   for predicting the mechanical performances of such nanocomposites. Then,
   we discuss various assembly techniques available for effectively
   incorporating the strong and flexible graphene-based components into
   polymer matrices by utilization of weak and strong interfacial
   interactions available in functionalized graphene sheets. We discuss
   mechanical performance and briefly summarize other physical (thermal,
   electrical, barrier, and optical) properties, which are controlled by
   processing conditions and interfacial interactions. Finally, we present
   a brief outlook of the developments in graphene-based polymer

Abstract = {{The goal of the structural health monitoring community has been to endow
   physical systems with a nervous system not unlike those commonly found
   in living organisms. Typically, the structural health monitoring
   community has attempted to do this by instrumenting structures with a
   variety of sensors and then applying various signal processing and
   classification procedures to the data in order to detect the presence of
   damage, the location of damage, the severity of damage, and to estimate
   the remaining useful life of the structure. This procedure has had some
   success, but we are still a long way from achieving the performance of
   nervous systems found in biology. This is primarily because contemporary
   classification algorithms do not have the performance required. In many
   cases, expert judgment is superior to automated classification. This
   work introduces a new paradigm. We propose interfacing the human nervous
   system to the distributed sensor network located on the structure and
   developing new techniques to enable human-machine cooperation. The
   results from the field of sensory substitution suggest this should be
   possible. This study investigates a vibro-haptic human-machine interface
   for structural health monitoring. The investigation was performed using
   a surrogate three-story structure. The structure features three
   nonlinearity-inducing bumpers to simulate damage. Accelerometers are
   placed on each floor to measure the response of the structure to a
   harmonic base excitation. The accelerometer measurements are
   preprocessed. The preprocessed data are then encoded as a vibro-tactile
   stimulus. Human subjects were then subjected to the vibro-tactile
   stimulus and asked to characterize the damage in the structure.}},

Abstract = {{Information from ex situ characterization can fall short in describing
   complex materials systems simultaneously exposed to multiple external
   stimuli. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to probe
   the local atomistic and electronic structure of specific elements in a
   La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) thin film cathode exposed to air
   contaminated with H2O and CO2 under operating conditions. While
   impedance spectroscopy showed that the polarization resistance of the
   LSCF cathode increased upon exposure to both contaminants at 750 degrees
   C, XAS near-edge and extended fine structure showed that the degree of
   oxidation for Fe and Co decreases with increasing temperature.
   Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy tracked the formation
   and removal of a carbonate species, a Co phase, and different oxygen
   moieties as functions of temperature and gas. The combined information
   provides insight into the fundamental mechanism by which H2O and CO2
   cause degradation in the cathode of solid oxide fuel cells.}},

Journal = {{CHEMSUSCHEM}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide-supported amine sorbents for CO2 capture are amongst the
   most rapidly developing classes of sorbent materials for CO2 capture.
   Herein, basic supports are used as hosts for amine sites through the
   grafting of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to the alumina surface under a
   variety of conditions, yielding the expected surface-grafted alkylamine
   groups, as demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy and Si-29 and C-13
   cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy.
   Grafting amine sites on the surface in the presence of water leads to a
   high density of amine sites on the surface whereas simultaneously
   creating a unique type of aluminum species on the surface, as
   demonstrated by both 1D and 2D Al-27 MAS NMR spectroscopy. The thus
   prepared sorbents result in higher CO2 adsorption capacities and amine
   efficiencies compared to sorbents prepared in the absence of water or
   similar amine loading sorbents prepared using silica supports. Insitu
   FTIR spectra of the sorbents exposed to CO2 at various pressures show no
   distinct difference in the nature of the adsorbed CO2 species on
   alumina- versus silica-supported amines, whereas water adsorption
   isotherms show that the improved performance of the amine-grafted
   alumina support is not a consequence of retained water on the more
   hydrophobic aminoalumina materials. The findings demonstrate that
   amine-grafted, basic alumina materials can be tuned to be more efficient
   than the corresponding silica-supported materials at comparable amine
   loadings, further demonstrating that the properties of amine sites can
   be tuned by controlling or adjusting the support surface properties.}},

Abstract = {{Metalorganic framework (MOF) materials are nanoporous crystals that have
   attracted intense interest in the fields of adsorption and catalysis.
   MOFs are interesting in part because of the concept of reticular
   synthesis, which allows families of isostructural crystals to be
   developed by varying ligand length and functionality. The predictability
   associated with MOF crystal structures is complicated in situations
   where ligand functionalization leads to new crystal structures. In this
   work, we show experimentally how the crystal structures of derivatives
   of HKUST-1 (Cu-BTC) vary for a set of six functionalized ligands:
   methyl, ethyl, methoxy, bromo, nitro, and acetamide. Our experiments
   indicate that synthesizing MOFs with these functionalized ligands leads
   to multiple distinct crystal structures. We further show that these
   structures can be rationalized computationally using density functional
   theory (DFT) and electron localization function (ELF) calculations. This
   analysis led to a simple design principle for predicting the structure
   using the bonding characteristics of the functional groups to BTC
   linkers. This heuristic, in combination with the more detailed
   calculations of the kind we have presented, will be useful in future
   efforts to predictively control the crystal structure of similar MOF
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed detection applications for a wireless sensor
   network (WSN) that has a limited time to collect and process local
   decisions to produce a global decision. When this time is not sufficient
   to collect decisions from all nodes in the network, a strategy is needed
   for collecting those with the highest reliability. This can be
   accomplished by incorporating a reliability-based splitting algorithm
   into the random access protocol of the WSN: the collection time is
   divided into frames and only nodes with a specified range of
   reliabilities compete for the channel using slotted ALOHA within each
   frame-nodes with the most reliable decisions attempt transmission in the
   first frame, nodes with the next most reliable set of decisions attempt
   in the next frame, etc. The detection error probability (DEP) of the
   proposed scheme is minimized, and the efficacy is maximized by
   determining the reliability intervals that define which nodes attempt to
   transmit in each frame. Intervals that maximize the channel throughput
   do not always minimize the DEP or maximize the efficacy. Because the
   scheme orders transmissions of the local decisions in approximately
   descending order of reliability but suffers collisions, it will offer
   better performance than a collision-free scheme with no reliability
   ordering when the time constraint prevents transmission of all local
   decisions. The transition point between the two schemes is found by
   deriving the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the proposed scheme
   relative to a TDMA-based scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a hybrid voltage/var control (VVC) architecture for
   distribution systems with a high PV penetration. The architecture
   consists of two control loops: coordinated normal control loop and
   uncoordinated transient cloud movement control loop. In the first loop,
   hourly dispatches are scheduled for on-load tap changer (OLTC),
   capacitor banks (CBs), and static var compensators (SVCs) based on
   forecasted load and PV power output so as to minimize power losses and
   voltage deviations. The second loop is triggered when large variations
   of PV power output caused by rapid cloud movement happen. All SVCs and
   CBs become self-controlled based on local voltage measurements with the
   single control objective to minimize voltage deviations. SVCs will
   operate firstly to flatten the voltage profile. If SVCs fail, CBs will
   switch to provide reactive power support. A time-adaptive delay is
   applied to each CB to avoid overcompensation. Case studies show the
   proposed method can optimize the system operation and is effective in
   voltage regulation with PV generators.}},

Abstract = {{Direct catalytic C-H bond functionalization is a key challenge in
   synthetic chemistry, with many popular C-H activation methodologies
   involving precious-metal catalysts. In recent years, iron catalysts have
   emerged as a possible alternative to the more common precious-metal
   catalysts, owing to its high abundance, low cost, and low toxicity.
   However, iron catalysts are plagued by two key factors: the ligand cost
   and the low turnover numbers (TONs) typically achieved. In this work,
   two approaches are presented to functionalize the popular
   N-1,N-2-dimethyl-N-1,N-2-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-ethane-1,2-diamine
   (BPMEN) ligand, so that it can be supported on porous silica or polymer
   resin supports. Four new catalysts are prepared and evaluated in an
   array of catalytic C-H functionalization reactions by using cyclohexane,
   cyclohexene, cyclooctane, adamantane, benzyl alcohol, and cumene with
   aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Catalyst recovery and recycling is
   demonstrated by using supported catalysts, which allows for a modest
   increase in the TON achieved with these catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based electronics have been considered as one of the most exciting
   technologies in the near future due to sustainability, low cost,
   mechanical flexibility, etc. Even though there have been numerous
   studies regarding this technology, there is not any available
   quantitative study on how paper electronics would minimize the impact on
   the environment. This work aims to give the first detailed analysis
   regarding this important question. To this end, we for the first time
   designed and prototyped paper-based multilayer printed circuit boards
   (P-PCBs), which show comparable functions to the currently available
   organic printed circuit boards (O-PCBs); yet the P-PCBs adopt a
   ``green{''} preparation process. A life cycle assessment study was
   performed to quantify the P-PCBs' environmental impacts, e.g.
   acidification potential, global warming potential, human toxic
   potential, ozone layer depletion potential, etc. Our current research
   reveals that the P-PCBs have about two magnitude lower impact on the
   environment than O-PCBs based on the results of the life cycle
   assessment, which suggests that the P-PCB technique is beneficial for
   the environment at the regional or global production level. The current
   study gives useful information and sheds light on the future
   technological directions for various paper based electronics studies.}},

Title = {{Effects of Input Shaping on Manual Control of Flexible and Time-Delayed
   Systems}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1284-1295}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective was to study the performance of a manual
   tracking task with system flexibility and time delays in the input
   channel and to examine the effects of input shaping the human operator's
   commands.
   Background: It has long been known that low-frequency, lightly damped
   vibration hinders performance of a manually controlled system. Recently,
   input shaping has been shown to improve the performance of such systems
   in a compensatory-display tracking task. It is unknown if similar
   improvements are seen with pursuit-display tasks, or how the improvement
   changes when time delays are added to the system.
   Method: A total of 18 novice participants performed a pursuit-view
   tracking experiment with a spring-centered joystick. Controlled elements
   included an integrator, an integrator with a lightly damped flexible
   mode, and an input-shaped integrator with a flexible mode. The input to
   these controlled elements was delayed between 0 and 1 s. Tracking
   performance was quantified by root mean square tracking error, and
   subjective difficulty was quantified by ratings on a Cooper-Harper
   scale.
   Results: Performance was best with the undelayed integrator. Both time
   delay and flexibility degraded performance. Input shaping improved
   control of the flexible element, with a diminishing benefit as the time
   delay increased. Tracking error and subjective rating were significantly
   related. Some operators used a pulsive control strategy.
   Conclusion: Input shaping can improve the performance of a manually
   controlled system with flexibility, even when time delays are present.
   Application: This study is useful to designers of human-controlled
   systems, especially those with problematic flexibility and/or time
   delays.}},

Title = {{Robust Optimization for Transmission Expansion Planning: Minimax Cost

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3069-3077}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to the long planning horizon, transmission expansion planning is
   typically subjected to a lot of uncertainties including load growth,
   renewable energy penetration, policy changes, etc. In addition,
   deregulation of the power industry and pressure from climate change
   introduced new sources of uncertainties on the generation side of the
   system. Generation expansion and retirement become highly uncertain as
   well. Some of the uncertainties do not have probability distributions,
   making it difficult to use stochastic programming. Techniques like
   robust optimization that do not require a probability distribution
   became desirable. To address these challenges, we study two optimization
   criteria for the transmission expansion planning problem under the
   robust optimization paradigm, where the maximum cost and maximum regret
   of the expansion plan over all uncertainties are minimized,
   respectively. With these models, our objective is to make planning
   decisions that are robust against all scenarios. We use a two-layer
   algorithm to solve the resulting tri-level optimization problems. Then,
   in our case studies, we compare the performance of the minimax cost
   approach and the minimax regret approach under different
   characterizations of uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the potential of a range camera in
   construction material sorting applications. By utilizing the depth
   information from a time-of-flight (TOF) camera, we identify and classify
   objects placed on a conveyor belt. The motivation stems from the fact
   that object manipulation and identification are two primary problems
   associated with automated handling and sorting of material objects
   moving on a conveyor belt. Such a problem may arise in the construction
   industry for handling objects such as formwork when it is returned to
   the distribution facility. We present algorithms and experimental
   results using the depth information from a TOF range camera for two
   distinct tasks: (1) object attribute measurement and (2) object
   identification. Experiments and results for both tasks indicate a
   potential benefit for the use of TOF range cameras in construction
   automation and robotic arm tasks as they relate, for example, to sorting
   applications in the construction-formwork business.}},

Abstract = {{Air traffic management aims at ensuring safe and efficient movement of
   aircraft in the airspace. With the predicted growth of air
   transportation, providing traffic flow managers with the tools to
   support decision-making is essential. These tools should aid in
   accommodating the air traffic throughput increase while limiting
   controller workload and ensuring high safety levels. The objective of
   this paper is to present a methodology to model and simulate traffic in
   a given portion of the airspace from data under nominal and perturbed
   conditions. A new framework for en route traffic flow management and
   airspace health monitoring is developed. It is based on a data-driven
   approach for air traffic flow modeling using historical data. This
   large-scale three-dimensional flow network provides valuable insight on
   airspace complexity. A linear programming formulation for optimizing en
   route air traffic is proposed. It takes into account a controller task
   load model based on flow geometry, in order to estimate airspace
   capacity. To analyze airspace degradation, weather blockage maps based
   on vertically integrated liquid are incorporated in the model,
   representing weather perturbations on the same dataset used to compute
   the flows. Comparing the weather blockages and the network model of the
   airspace provides means of quantifying airspace degradation. The impact
   of the perturbations is then examined. The results of the simulations
   are compared with the data from these specific days, to identify the
   advantages and drawbacks of the present model. The methodology presented
   is scalable and adaptable to various types of airspaces, traffic loads,
   and uncertainty levels. This work is contributing to a better data-based
   understanding of traffic congestion, rerouting options depending on
   origin and destination pairs, how traffic patterns influence the
   controller task load, and how the size and location of weather cells
   impact air traffic operations.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the electrically conductive vacuum chamber wall in the
   completion of the discharge circuit of a Hall effect thruster is
   experimentally investigated. The Aerojet Rocketdyne T-140
   laboratory-model Hall effect thruster, operating at a discharge voltage
   of 300 V, a discharge current of 5.16 A, and an anode flow rate of 5.80
   mg/s, serves as a representative Hall effect thruster testbed. The
   nominal facility operating pressure during thruster firings is 4.9 x
   10(-6) torr, corrected for xenon. Two 0.91 x 0.91 m, square aluminum
   plates are placed adjacent to, but electrically isolated from, the walls
   of the stainless-steel vacuum chamber at two locations with respect to
   the center of the thruster exit plane: 4.3 m axially downstream along
   the thruster centerline and 2.3 m radially outward centered on the exit
   plane. The plates are configured in three distinct electrical
   configurations with corresponding measurements: 1) electrically grounded
   plates with measurements of currents to ground, 2) electrically isolated
   plates with measurements of floating voltages, and 3) isolated but
   electrically connected plates with measurements of the current conducted
   between them. The measurements are all taken simultaneously, with the
   discharge current oscillations of the thruster at a sampling frequency
   of 100 MHz. Measurements of the current conducted to ground in the
   electrically grounded configuration reveal that the axial and radial
   plates collect ion currents that are 13.6 and 10.7\% of the discharge
   current, respectively; the collected current is coupled to the discharge
   current oscillations but is smaller in magnitude and phase delayed. In
   the electrically connected-plate configuration, 5.5\% of the average
   discharge current is observed to flow from the axial plate to the radial
   plate, driven by a floating voltage difference of 7.6 V; this current is
   uncorrelated in time with the discharge current oscillations. These
   results indicate that the vacuum chamber conducts current and is a
   recombination site for a significant number of plume ions during Hall
   effect thruster operation.}},

   The procedure is novel because, in theory, it allows prediction of

   may find direct use in the analysis of thermodynamic cycles and the
   computations of flowfields requiring properties of combustion products.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the effect of jet-grouting on soil
   stiffness. Several homogenization techniques are tested at the scale of
   a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) to determine the stiffness of a
   mixture made of sand and grout. (1) The averaging method is employed to
   compute the mechanical stiffness of grouted soil under the assumption
   that internal stress is mostly supported by the soil skeleton. (2) A
   hollow sphere model is proposed to predict stiffness under the
   assumption that soil grains do not contribute to the mechanical
   resistance of cemented soil. (3) Eshleby's homogenization scheme is used
   to model cemented soil stiffness for a dilute distribution of grains
   embedded in grout. The hollow sphere model gives more flexibility in the
   description of soil fabric, but does not account for soil grain
   mechanical properties. Eshelby's technique is attractive, but more work
   is required to improve the representation of cemented soil fabric,
   especially the soil grain space distribution in the mixture of sand and
   grout. Settlements above a tunnel surrounded by two rows of jet-grouted
   columns are computed using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Numerical
   results for vertical displacements and stress are interpreted with
   Handy's arching theory.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider frequency assignment for orthogonal frequency

   framework for the mathematical modeling of the frequency assignment
   problem, which aims at suppressing multi-links interference and

   modern graph theory is utilized to recast the original frequency
   assignment problem and guide the solution from graph theory perspective.
   In addition, optimal position of relay stations in a hierarchical
   cluster based two-hop cellular networks is investigated, and proposes an
   efficient frequency assignment scheme based on the incidence coloring.
   System-level simulation results demonstrate that the frequency
   assignment scheme can effectively mitigate inter-cell interference and
   improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Compared with existing
   frequency assignment schemes, better coverage performance is obtained
   and throughput of cell-edge mobile stations is greatly improved.}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterial-mediated controlled release of soluble signaling molecules
   is a tissue engineering approach to spatially control processes of
   inflammation, microvascular remodeling and host cell recruitment, and to
   generate biochemical gradients in vivo. Lipid mediators, such as
   sphingosine 1-phosphate (SIP), are recognized for their essential roles
   in spatial guidance, signaling and highly regulated endogenous
   gradients. SIP and pharmacological analogs such as FTY720 are
   therapeutically attractive targets for their critical roles in the
   trafficking of cells between blood and tissue spaces, both
   physiologically and pathophysiologically. However, the interaction of
   locally delivered sphingolipids with the complex metabolic networks
   controlling the flux of lipid species in inflamed tissue has yet to be
   elucidated. In this study, complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches
   are investigated to identify relationships between polymer composition,
   drug release kinetics, SIP metabolic activity, signaling gradients and
   spatial positioning of circulating cells around poly(lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) biomaterials. Results demonstrate that biomaterial-based gradients
   of SIP are short-lived in the tissue due to degradation by SW lyase, an
   enzyme that irreversibly degrades intracellular SIP. On the other hand,
   in vivo gradients of the more stable compound, FTY720, enhance
   microvascular remodeling by selectively recruiting an anti-inflammatory
   subset of monocytes (SlP(3)(high)) to the biomaterial. Results highlight
   the need to better understand the endogenous balance of lipid
   import/export machinery and lipid kinase/phosphatase activity in order
   to design biomaterial products that spatially control the innate immune
   environment to maximize regenerative potential. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{A strain-sensing lyriform organ (HS-10) found on all of the legs of a
   Central American wandering spider (Cupiennius salei) detects courtship,
   prey and predator vibrations transmitted by the plant on which it sits.
   It has been suggested that the viscoelastic properties of a cuticular
   pad directly adjacent to the sensory organ contribute to the organ's
   pronounced high-pass characteristics. Here, we investigate the
   micromechanical properties of the cuticular pad biomaterial in search of
   a deeper understanding of its impact on the function of the vibration
   sensor. These properties are considered to be an effective adaptation
   for the selective detection of signals for frequencies >40 Hz. Using
   surface force spectroscopy mapping we determine the elastic modulus of
   the pad surface over a temperature range of 15-40 degrees C at various
   loading frequencies. In the glassy state, the elastic modulus was
   similar to 100 MPa, while in the rubbery state the elastic modulus
   decreased to 20 MPa. These data are analyzed according to the principle
   of time-temperature superposition to construct a master curve that
   relates mechanical properties, temperature and stimulus frequencies. By
   estimating the loss and storage moduli vs. temperature and frequency it
   was possible to make a direct comparison with electrophysiology
   experiments, and it was found that the dissipation of energy occurs
   within a frequency window whose position is controlled by environmental
   temperatures. (C) 2014 Acts Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for defining a coordinate system to
   parameterize a sampled Pareto frontier of a continuous multi-attribute
   design problem using a modified self-organizing map. By defining such a
   coordinate system, the design problem may be reformulated from y = f(x)
   to (y,x) = g(psi), where x is a vector of design variables, y is a
   vector of attributes, and psi is a vector of barycentric coordinates.
   Exploration of the design problem using psi as the independent variables
   has the following desirable properties: 1) Every vector psi corresponds
   to a Pareto efficient design, and every Pareto efficient design has a
   corresponding psi. 2) The number of psi coordinates is equal to the
   number of attributes, regardless of the number of design variables. 3)
   Each attribute y(i) has a corresponding coordinate psi(i) such that the
   sign of partial derivative y(i)/partial derivative psi(i) is positive if
   the objective is to maximize y(i) and negative if the objective is to
   minimize y(i) (i.e., the attributes improve monotonically as their
   corresponding coordinates increase). This approach, named the ``Pareto
   simplex self-organizing map{''} is easily implemented as a
   postprocessing step to sampling a Pareto frontier with multi-objective
   optimization. The construction of the coordinates and their use in
   design space exploration is demonstrated on a conceptual wing design
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the thermostability of an alkaline alpha-amylase from
   Alkalimonas amylolytica was significantly improved through
   structure-based rational and the introduction of multiple arginines
   (Arg) on the protein surface. Based on an analysis of the tertiary
   structure, seven residues (glutamine (Gln) 166, Gln 169, serine (Ser)
   270, lysine (Lys) 315, Gln 327, asparagine (Asn) 346, and Asn 423) were
   selected as engineering targets and individually replaced with arginine.
   Five of the seven single-mutated enzymes-S270R, K315R, Q327R, N346R, and
   N423R-showed enhanced thermostability. Multiple arginines were
   subsequently introduced on the protein surface, and the
   quintuple-mutated enzyme S270R/K315R/Q327R/N346R/N423R showed a 6.4-fold
   improvement in half-life at 60 and a 5.4 A degrees C increase in melting
   temperature (T (m)) compared with those of wild-type enzyme.
   Concomitantly, the optimal temperature, optimal pH, and catalytic
   efficiency of this mutated enzyme also improved. The mutated enzyme
   displayed a large shift in optimal pH from 9.5 to 11.0. In addition, the
   optimum temperature increased from 50 to 55 A degrees C, and the
   catalytic efficiency (k (cat)/K (m)) increased from 1.8 x 10(4) to 3.6 x
   10(4) L/(g A center dot min). The intramolecular interactions of mutated
   enzymes that contributed to increased thermostability were examined
   through comparative analysis of the model structures of wild-type and
   mutated enzymes. The thermostable mutated enzymes generated in this
   study have potential applications in the textile industry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new set of probabilistic joint shear strength
   models using the conventional multiple linear regression method, and
   advanced machine-learning methods of multivariate adaptive regression
   splines (MARS) and symbolic regression (SR). In order to achieve
   high-fidelity regression models with reduced model errors and bias, this
   study constructs extensive experimental databases for reinforced and
   unreinforced concrete joints by collecting existing beam-column joint
   subassemblage tests from multiple sources. Various influential
   parameters that affect joint shear strength such as material properties,
   design parameters, and joint configuration are investigated through
   tests of statistical significance. After performing a set of regression
   analyses, the comparison of simulation results indicates that MARS
   approach is the best estimation method. Moreover, the accuracy of
   analytical predictions of the derived MARS model is compared with that
   of existing joint shear strength relationships. The comparison results
   show that the proposed model is more accurate compared to existing
   relationships. This joint shear strength prediction model can be readily
   implemented into joint response models for evaluation of earthquake
   performance and inelastic responses of building frames. Copyright (c)

   Nineteen (19) patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy
   (CRT) received a cardiac MRI at 1.5T 1 week before treatment. Coronary
   vein images were acquired using a 3D, navigator- and ECG-gated,
   contrast-enhanced, inversion-recovery, fast low-angle shot (FLASH)
   sequence. X-ray venography was performed during the CRT procedure to
   image the coronary venous anatomy and the LV lead location. MRI coronary
   vein images were graded on a 0-3 scale (0 = nonexistent, 1 = poor, 2 =
   good, 3 = excellent). MRI and X-ray venogram images were also graded
   using a binary visible/not visible scheme to compare the visibility of
   the coronary veins.
   The mean visibility scores for the coronary sinus, the posterior
   interventricular, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, the left
   marginal vein, and the anterior interventricular were 3.0 +/- 0.2, 2.3
   +/- 0.7, 1.6 +/- 1.1, 1.9 +/- 0.8 and 2.4 +/- 0.9, respectively. When
   compared to X-ray venography, MRI was capable of visualizing 90 \% of
   veins and all of the veins used for LV lead implantation. The vein used
   for LV lead implantation had an average vein image quality score of 1.9

Abstract = {{PurposeThis work develops a compressive sensing approach for
   diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI.
   Theory and MethodsA phase-constrained low-rank (PCLR) approach was
   developed using the image coherence across the DW directions for
   efficient compressive DW MRI, while accounting for drastic phase changes
   across the DW directions, possibly as a result of eddy current, and
   rigid and nonrigid motions. In PCLR, a low-resolution phase estimation
   was used for removing phase inconsistency between DW directions. In our
   implementation, GRAPPA (generalized autocalibrating partial parallel
   acquisition) was incorporated for better phase estimation while allowing
   higher undersampling factor. An efficient and easy-to-implement image
   reconstruction algorithm, consisting mainly of partial Fourier update
   and singular value decomposition, was developed for solving PCLR.
   ResultsThe error measures based on diffusion-tensor-derived metrics and
   tractography indicated that PCLR, with its joint reconstruction of all
   DW images using the image coherence, outperformed the frame-independent
   reconstruction through zero-padding FFT. Furthermore, using GRAPPA for
   phase estimation, PCLR readily achieved a four-fold undersampling.
   ConclusionThe PCLR is developed and demonstrated for compressive DW MRI.
   A four-fold reduction in k-space sampling could be readily achieved
   without substantial degradation of reconstructed images and diffusion
   tensor measures, making it possible to significantly reduce the data
   acquisition in DW MRI and/or improve spatial and angular resolutions.

Abstract = {{The combustion-wave propagation of nickel-coated aluminum particles is
   studied theoretically for packing densities in the range of 10-100\% of
   the theoretical maximum density. Emphasis is placed on the effect of
   packing density on the burning properties. The energy conservation
   equation is solved numerically and the burning rate is determined by
   tracking the position of the flame front. Atomic diffusion coefficients
   and reaction rate of isolated nickel-coated aluminum particles are input
   parameters to the model. The burning behaviors and combustion wave
   structures are dictated by the heat transfer from the flame zone to the
   unburned region. Five different models for the effective thermal
   conductivity of the mixture are employed. The impact of radiation heat
   transfer is also assessed. As a specific example, the case with a
   particle size of 79 mu m is considered in detail. The burning rate
   remains nearly constant (<1 cm/s) up to a packing density of 60\%, and
   then increases sharply toward the maximum value of 11.55 cm/s at a
   density of 100\%. The Maxwell-Eucken-Bruggeman model of thermal
   conductivity offers the most accurate predictions of the burning rate
   for all loading densities. (c) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published

Abstract = {{The massive cracking of silicon thin film electrodes in lithium ion
   batteries is associated with the colossal volume changes that occur
   during lithiation and delithiation cycles. However, the underlying
   cracking mechanism or even whether fracture initiates during lithiation
   or delithiation is still unknown. Here, we model the stress generation
   in amorphous silicon thin films during lithium insertion, fully
   accounting for the effects of finite strains, plastic flow, and
   pressure-gradients on the diffusion of lithium. Our finite element
   analyses demonstrate that the fracture of lithiated silicon films occurs
   by a sequential cracking mechanism which is distinct from fracture
   induced by residual tension in conventional thin films. During
   early-stage lithiation, the expansion of the lithium-silicon subsurface
   layer bends the film near the edges, and generates a high tensile stress
   zone at a critical distance away within the lithium-free silicon.
   Fracture initiates at this high tension zone and creates new film edges,
   which in turn bend and generate high tensile stresses a further critical
   distance away. Under repeated lithiation and delithiation cycles, this
   sequential cracking mechanism creates silicon islands of uniform
   diameter, which scales with the film thickness. The predicted island
   sizes, as well as the abrupt mitigation of fracture below a critical
   film thickness due to the diminishing tensile stress zone, is
   quantitatively in good agreement with experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) alloys offer great potential for
   high-efficiency photovoltaics, yet theoretical promise has not been
   experimentally demonstrated. Several major challenges remain including
   polarization effects, suitable p-type doping, improved surface
   passivation, and growth of thick, high-quality InGaN layers. In this
   paper, we present numerical simulations of InGaN p-i-n single-junction
   solar cells to provide guidelines for performance improvement through
   optimization of device structures given achievable material
   characteristics. The performance of both InGaN/GaN heterojunction
   devices that are presently achievable and InGaN homojunction solar cells
   that should be feasible in the future are investigated through the
   calculation of characteristic parameters: short-circuit current density,
   open-circuit voltage, and conversion efficiency. These simulations study
   the effect of indium content, thickness, and background doping of the
   unintentionally-doped InGaN absorbing layer on the performance of both
   InGaN solar-cell designs. While the maximum efficiency of a p-i-n
   InGaN/GaN heterojunction solar cell with low indium composition is
   11.3\%, the conversion efficiency of heterojunction devices with high
   indium composition needed for longer wavelength absorption drastically
   reduces because of polarization effects. Above an indium composition of
   45\%, the modeled heterojunction devices do not operate as solar cells.
   Using presently achievable values of minority carrier lifetime and
   surface recombination velocity, the maximum efficiency of InGaN
   single-homojunction solar cells with optimized parameters is 17\%, which
   is significantly smaller than the theoretical maximum energy-conversion
   efficiency for single-junction cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The effect of conditional inactivation of beta 1 integrins using twist 2
   Cre, Osterix Cre and osteocalcin Cre lines on skeletal phenotype}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{131-141}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Skeletal development and growth are complex processes regulated by
   multiple microenvironmental cues, including integrin-ECM interactions.
   The beta 1 sub-family of integrins is the largest integrin sub-family
   and constitutes the main integrin binding partners of collagen I, the
   major ECM component of bone. As complete beta 1 integrin knockout
   results in embryonic lethality, studies of beta 1 integrin function in
   vivo rely on tissue-specific gene deletions. While multiple in vitro
   studies indicate that beta 1 integrins are crucial regulators of
   osteogenesis and mineralization, in vivo osteoblast-specific
   perturbations of beta 1 integrins have resulted in mild and sometimes
   contradictory skeletal phenotypes. To further investigate the role of
   beta 1 integrins on skeletal phenotype, we used the Twist2-Cre,
   Osterix-Cre and osteocalcin-Cre lines to generate conditional beta 1
   integrin deletions, where Cre is expressed primarily in mesenchymal
   condensation, pre-osteoblast, and mature osteoblast lineage cells
   respectively within these lines. Mice with Twist2-specific beta 1
   integrin disruption were smaller, had impaired skeletal development,
   especially in the craniofacial and vertebral tissues at E19.5, and did
   not survive beyond birth. Osterix-specific beta 1 integrin deficiency
   resulted in viable mice which were normal at birth but displayed early
   defects in calvarial ossification, incisor eruption and growth as well
   as femoral bone mineral density, structure, and mechanical properties.
   Although these defects persisted into adulthood, they became milder with
   age. Finally, a lack of beta 1 integrins in mature osteoblasts and
   osteocytes resulted in minor alterations to femur structure but had no
   effect on mineral density, biomechanics or fracture healing. Taken
   together, our data indicate that beta 1 integrin expression in early
   mesenchymal condensations play an important role in skeletal
   ossification, while beta 1 integrin-ECM interactions in pre-osteoblast,
   odontoblast- and hypertrophic chondryocyte-lineage cells regulate
   incisor eruption and perinatal bone formation in both intramembranously
   and endochondrally formed bones in young, rapidly growing mice. In
   contrast, the osteocalcin-specific beta 1 integrin deletion had only
   minor effects on skeletal phenotype. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Children may have differing susceptibility to ambient air
   pollution concentrations depending on various background characteristics
   of the children.
   Methods: Using emergency department (ED) data linked with birth records
   from Atlanta, Georgia, we identified ED visits for asthma or wheeze
   among children 2 to 16 years of age from 1 January 2002 through 30 June
   2010 (n = 109,758). We stratified by preterm delivery, term low birth
   weight, maternal race, Medicaid status, maternal education, maternal
   smoking, delivery method, and history of a bronchiolitis ED visit.
   Population-weighted daily average concentrations were calculated for
   1-hour maximum carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide; 8-hour maximum
   ozone; and 24-hour average particulate matter less than 10 microns in
   diameter, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5),
   and the PM2.5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon,
   and organic carbon, using measurements from stationary monitors. Poisson
   time-series models were used to estimate rate ratios for associations
   between 3-day moving average pollutant concentrations and daily ED visit
   counts and to investigate effect-measure modification by the
   stratification factors.
   Results: Associations between pollutant concentrations and asthma
   exacerbations were larger among children born preterm and among children
   born to African American mothers. Stratification by race and preterm
   status together suggested that both factors affected susceptibility. The
   largest estimated effect size (for an interquartile range increase in
   pollution) was observed for ozone among preterm births to African
   American mothers: rate ratio = 1.138 (95\% confidence interval =
   1.077-1.203). In contrast, the rate ratio for the ozone association
   among full-term births to mothers of other races was 1.025
   (0.970-1.083).
   Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that children vary in their
   susceptibility to ambient air pollutants.}},

Title = {{Exploring Automated Text Classification to Improve Keyword Corpus Search
   Results for Bioinspired Design}},

Abstract = {{Bioinspired design is the adaptation of methods, strategies, or
   principles found in nature to solve engineering problems. One formalized
   approach to bioinspired solution seeking is the abstraction of the
   engineering problem into a functional need and then seeking solutions to
   this function using a keyword type search method on text based
   biological knowledge. These function keyword search approaches have
   shown potential for success, but as with many text based search methods,
   they produce a large number of results, many of little relevance to the
   problem in question. In this paper, we develop a method to train a
   computer to identify text passages more likely to suggest a solution to
   a human designer. The work presented examines the possibility of
   filtering biological keyword search results by using text mining
   algorithms to automatically identify which results are likely to be
   useful to a designer. The text mining algorithms are trained on a pair
   of surveys administered to human subjects to empirically identify a
   large number of sentences that are, or are not, helpful for idea
   generation. We develop and evaluate three text classification
   algorithms, namely, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, a k nearest neighbors
   (kNN) classifier, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Of
   these methods, the NB classifier generally had the best performance.
   Based on the analysis of 60 word stems, a NB classifier's precision is
   0.87, recall is 0.52, and F score is 0.65. We find that word stem
   features that describe a physical action or process are correlated with
   helpful sentences. Similarly, we find biological jargon feature words
   are correlated with unhelpful sentences.}},

Title = {{Identifying Trends in Analogy Usage for Innovation: A Cross-Sectional
   Product Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Design-by-analogy, including bioinspired design, is a powerful tool for
   innovation. Engineers need better tools to enhance ideation. To support
   tool creation, an exploratory cross-sectional empirical product study of
   70 analogy-inspired products is conducted to report trends and
   associations among factors in the analogy-inspired design process,
   giving a general account of real-world practices. Products are randomly
   sampled from three technology magazines and a bioinspired design
   database. Seven variables are developed and used to classify each
   example according to design team composition, analogy mapping approach,
   analogies used, and design outcomes. Results do not suggest significant
   differences between problem-driven approaches, which start from a design
   problem and find solutions in analogous domains, and solution-driven
   approaches, which begin with knowledge in an analog domain and find
   design problems to solve. For instance, results suggest that both
   approaches yield products at about the same frequency, and both yield
   products with improved performance at statistically indistinguishable
   rates-thus, neither approach can be concluded to be advantageous over
   the other for improving product performance at this time. Overall, few
   associations are detected between design outcome variables and other
   variables, thus precluding recommendations for how to compose design
   teams, what approaches to promote, and what number and source of
   analogies to support in order to achieve the outcomes measured in this
   study.}},

Title = {{Oxygen at Nanomolar Levels Reversibly Suppresses Process Rates and Gene
   Expression in Anammox and Denitrification in the Oxygen Minimum Zone off
   Northern Chile}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A major percentage (20 to 40\%) of global marine fixed-nitrogen loss
   occurs in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Concentrations of O-2 and the
   sensitivity of the anaerobic N-2-producing processes of anammox and
   denitrification determine where this loss occurs. We studied
   experimentally how O-2 at nanomolar levels affects anammox and
   denitrification rates and the transcription of nitrogen cycle genes in
   the anoxic OMZ off Chile. Rates of anammox and denitrification were
   reversibly suppressed, most likely at the enzyme level. Fifty percent
   inhibition of N-2 and N2O production by denitrification was achieved at
   205 and 297 nM O-2, respectively, whereas anammox was 50\% inhibited at
   886 nM O-2. Coupled metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that
   transcripts encoding nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), nitrite reductase
   (nirS), and nitric oxide reductase (norB) decreased in relative
   abundance above 200 nM O-2. This O-2 concentration did not suppress the
   transcription of other dissimilatory nitrogen cycle genes, including
   nitrate reductase (narG), hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo), and nitrite
   reductase (nirK). However, taxonomic characterization of transcripts
   suggested inhibition of narG transcription in gammaproteobacteria,
   whereas the transcription of anammox narG, whose gene product is likely
   used to oxidatively replenish electrons for carbon fixation, was not
   inhibited. The taxonomic composition of transcripts differed among
   denitrification enzymes, suggesting that distinct groups of
   microorganisms mediate different steps of denitrification. Sulfide
   addition (1 mu M) did not affect anammox or O-2 inhibition kinetics but
   strongly stimulated N2O production by denitrification. These results
   identify new O-2 thresholds for delimiting marine nitrogen loss and
   highlight the utility of integrating biogeochemical and
   metatranscriptomic analyses.
   IMPORTANCE The removal of fixed nitrogen via anammox and denitrification
   associated with low O-2 concentrations in oceanic oxygen minimum zones
   (OMZ) is a major sink in oceanic N budgets, yet the sensitivity and
   dynamics of these processes with respect to O-2 are poorly known. The
   present study elucidated how nanomolar O-2 concentrations affected
   nitrogen removal rates and expression of key nitrogen cycle genes in
   water from the eastern South Pacific OMZ, applying state-of-the-art N-15
   techniques and metatranscriptomics. Rates of both denitrification and
   anammox responded rapidly and reversibly to changes in O-2, but
   denitrification was more O-2 sensitive than anammox. The transcription
   of key nitrogen cycle genes did not respond as clearly to O-2, although
   expression of some of these genes decreased. Quantifying O-2 sensitivity
   of these processes is essential for predicting through which pathways
   and in which environments, from wastewater treatment to the open oceans,
   nitrogen removal may occur.}},

Abstract = {{Wnt5a and 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 are important regulators of endochondral
   ossification. In osteoblasts and growth plate chondrocytes, 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 initiates rapid effects via its membrane-associated
   receptor protein disulfide isomerase A3 (Pdia3) in caveolae, activating
   phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2))-activating protein (PLAA),
   calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and PLA(2),
   resulting in protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Wnt5a initiates its
   calcium-dependent effects via intracellular calcium release, activating
   PKC and CaMKII. We investigated the requirement for components of the
   Pdia3 receptor complex in Wnt5a calcium-dependent signaling. We
   determined that Wnt5a signals through a CaMKII/PLA(2)/PGE(2)/PKC
   cascade. Silencing or blocking Pdia3, PLAA, or vitamin D receptor (VDR),
   and inhibition of calmodulin (CaM), CaMKII, or PLA(2) inhibited
   Wnt5a-induced PKC activity. Wnt5a activated PKC in caveolin-l-silenced
   cells, but methyl-beta-cyclodextrin reduced its stimulatory effect. 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 reduced stimulatory effects of Wnt5a on PKC in a
   dose-dependent manner. In contrast, Wnt5a had a biphasic effect on 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated PKC activation; 50 ng/ml Wnt5a caused a
   2-fold increase in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated PKC but higher Wnt5a
   concentrations reduced 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated PKC activation.
   Western blots showed that Wnt receptors Frizzled2 (FZD2) and Frizzled5
   (FZD5), and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) were
   localized to caveolae. Blocking ROR2, but not FZD2 or FZD5, abolished
   the stimulatory effects of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 on PKC and CaMKII 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 membrane receptor complex components (Pdia3, PLAA,
   caveolin-1, CaM) interacted with Wnt5a receptors/co-receptors (ROR2,
   FZD2, FZD5) in immunoprecipitation studies, interactions that changed
   with either 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 or Wnt5a treatment. This study
   demonstrates that 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 and Wnt5a mediate their effects
   via similar receptor components and suggests that these pathways may
   interact. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{17 beta-Estradiol can promote the growth and development of several
   estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers. The effects are rapid
   and non-genomic, suggesting that a membrane-associated ER is involved.
   ER alpha 36 has been shown to mediate rapid, non-genomic,
   membrane-associated effects of 17 beta-estradiol in several cancer cell
   lines, including triple negative HCC38 breast cancer cells. Moreover,
   the effect is anti-apoptotic. The aim of this study was to determine if
   ER alpha 36 mediates this anti-apoptotic effect, and to elucidate the
   mechanism involved. Taxol was used to induce apoptosis in HCC38 cells,
   and the effect of 17 beta-estradiol pre-treatment was determined.
   Antibodies to ER alpha 36, signal pathway inhibitors, ER alpha 36
   deletion mutants, and ER alpha 36-silencing were used prior to these
   treatments to determine the role of ER alpha 36 in these effects and to
   determine which signaling molecules were involved. We found that the
   anti-apoptotic effect of 17 beta-estradiol in HCC38 breast cancer cells
   is in fact mediated by membrane-associated ER alpha 36. We also showed
   that this signaling occurs through a pathway that requires PLD, LPA, and
   PI3K; Gets and calcium signaling may also be involved. In addition,
   dynamic palmitoylation is required for the membrane-associated effect of
   17 beta-estradiol. Exon 9 of ER alpha 36, a unique exon to ER alpha 36
   not found in other identified splice variants of ER alpha with
   previously unknown function, is necessary for these effects. This study
   provides a working model for a mechanism by which estradiol promotes
   anti-apoptosis through membrane-associated ER alpha 36, suggesting that
   ER alpha 36 may be a potential membrane target for drug design against
   breast cancer, particularly triple negative breast cancer. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Carbide-derived carbons with embedded Fe nanoparticles are synthesized
   by partial chlorination of iron carbide at 600 degrees C. Interestingly,
   the residual Fe studied by X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy show
   the extraction process does not follow a layer-by-layer extraction
   process, as proposed in the literature for the chlorination of other
   carbides. Instead, a large percentage of iron carbide converts to iron
   (II) and iron (III) chloride nanoparticles, which remain trapped within
   the resulting nanoporous carbon framework. Further reductive treatment
   can be used to produce dispersed Fe nanoparticles with an average
   particle diameter approaching 10 nm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We applied shape modeling and principal component analysis (PCA) to
   discover glenoid bone structural relationships relevant to improving
   glenoid prosthesis features, fixation, and instrumentation. Knowledge of
   external bone morphology guides prosthesis shape and positioning, while
   internal bone morphology and bone density influence fixation. CT-based
   modeling defined nonarthritic glenoid subchondral bone surface and
   internal structure. First and second principal shape components were
   related to size and density. Reproducible structural parameters and
   glenoid feature relationships were discovered. Subchondral bone surface
   was approximated by a circle inferiorly and a triangle superiorly with
   the circle's center at a reproducible point along a superior-inferior
   line. Glenoid vault's maximum depth was at the circle's center, and the
   highest bone density was in posterior glenoid. Glenoid subchondral bone
   surface version varied from superior to inferior, but not by sex or
   side. Male subchondral bone surfaces were larger and more retroverted.
   Even if subchondral bone surfaces are deformed by arthritis, glenoid
   morphology can be identified by extra-articular landmarks, permitting
   location of the glenoid center and scapular orientation (glenoid
   version). Knowledge obtained from this study directs design of novel
   prosthesis features and instrumentation for use without pre-op CT or
   computer aided surgery. (c) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Title = {{A fission collision separation method for efficient incident flux
   response expansion coefficient generation}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{264-269}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A new fission collision (generation) separation method has been
   developed for generating incident flux response expansion coefficients
   and implemented into the hybrid stochastic/deterministic coarse mesh
   transport (COMET) method for whole core criticality (eigenvalue)
   calculations. During the stochastic pre-computation of the response
   library, all coefficients associated with each fission neutron
   generation are tallied separately. This enables COMET to directly
   calculate the eigenvalue (k) dependent response coefficients on-the-fly
   as a superposition of contributions from the nth fission neutron
   generation scaled by the factor (1/k)(n). The new method is as accurate
   as or more accurate and significantly more efficient than the existing
   response methods, regardless of whether the fission source is treated
   explicitly or implicitly as in COMET. The method also removes the
   eigenvalue range restriction on the response library.
   The 3D C5G7 benchmark problem was used to test the accuracy and
   efficiency of the new response coefficient generation method at both
   lattice (local) and core (global) levels. For lattice calculations, the
   response coefficients computed by the new method were compared with
   those computed by the direct Monte Carlo method. It was found that the
   truncation errors of the fission neutron separation method at expansion
   order 3 are much lower than the stochastic uncertainties of the response
   coefficients and consequently can be ignored. The average truncation
   errors of the new method ranged from 0\% to 0.004\% and 0\% to 0.08\%
   for the surface-to-surface and fission density response coefficients,
   respectively. For core level calculations, the COMET whole-core
   solutions based on the response coefficient libraries generated by the
   new method and the interpolation method were compared With direct
   (reference) Monte Carlo calculations using the MCNP code. It was found
   that the error in the eigenvalues predicted by COMET based on the new
   method is within 11-26 pcm for three core configurations with and
   without control rods. These eigenvalue results are about 15 pcm more
   accurate than those based on the interpolation method, although still
   within the overall uncertainty. The corresponding assembly and pin
   fission densities are almost identical for the two methods. These
   comparisons indicate that the new method is as accurate as or slightly
   more accurate than the interpolation method, depending on the comparison
   parameter. The new method was found to be about 5 times faster than the
   interpolation method for the generation of the response function
   library. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Abstraction from demonstration for efficient reinforcement learning in

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{216}},
Pages = {{103-128}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning (RL) and learning from demonstration (LID) are
   two popular families of algorithms for learning policies for sequential
   decision problems, but they are often ineffective in high-dimensional
   domains unless provided with either a great deal of problem-specific
   domain information or a carefully crafted representation of the state
   and dynamics of the world. We introduce new approaches inspired by these
   two techniques, which we broadly call abstraction from demonstration.
   Our first algorithm, state abstraction from demonstration (AM), uses a
   small set of human demonstrations of the task the agent must learn to
   determine a state-space abstraction. Our second algorithm, abstraction
   and decomposition from demonstration (ADA), is additionally able to
   determine a task decomposition from the demonstrations. These
   abstractions allow RL to scale up to higher-complexity domains, and
   offer much better performance than LfD with orders of magnitude fewer
   demonstrations. Using a set of videogame-like domains, we demonstrate
   that using abstraction from demonstration can obtain up to exponential
   speed-ups in table-based representations, and polynomial speed-ups when
   compared with function approximation-based RL algorithms such as fitted
   Q-learning and LSPI. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ReO3-type materials are of interest for their potential low or negative
   thermal expansion. Many metal trifluorides MF3 adopt the cubic form of
   this structure at elevated temperatures, which rhombohedrally distorts
   upon cooling. The rhombohedral form displays strong positive volume
   thermal expansion, but cubic MF3 display much lower and sometimes
   negative thermal expansion. The expansion behavior of alpha-AlF3 was
   characterized via synchrotron powder diffraction between 323 and 1177 K.
   alpha-AlF3 is rhombohedral at ambient conditions and displays strongly
   anisotropic thermal expansion. The volume coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE), alpha(v), at 500 K is similar to 86 ppm K-1, but the
   linear CTE along the c-axis, alpha(c), is close to zero. alpha-AlF3
   becomes cubic on heating to similar to 713 K and continues to show

Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{126-131}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The new quantitative approach to elastohydrodynamic lubrication requires
   a description of the steady shear dependent viscosity for calculations
   of film thickness and friction. This property can be obtained from
   measurements in pressurized thin-film Couette viscometers. However,
   frequency dependent viscosity can be obtained from a torsionally
   vibrating quartz crystal viscometer at high pressure or a relatively
   simple ambient pressure measurement with a shear impedance spectrometer.
   Here it is Shown for squalane and for a cyclic hydrocarbon and for a
   diester that both the steady shear dependent viscosity and the frequency
   dependent viscosity obey time-temperature-pressure superposition with
   the simplest shifting rule over the range of conditions investigated.
   Flow curves shift along a constant steady stress path or a constant
   complex modulus path. The Cox-Merz rule has been confirmed only for
   squalane and then only near the transition. The EHL friction for
   squalane at low pressure may be predicted with fair accuracy from the
   frequency dependent viscosity measured at ambient pressure. It appears
   that the Cox-Merz rule only applies to low-molecular-weight liquids when
   the molecule is composed of a long chain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   confirms that the average size of nanoparticles is about 10-15 nm and
   the perfect crystalline structure is confirmed by high magnification TEM
   and electron diffraction pattern. The maximum saturation magnetization
   of 85.93 emu/g is obtained when x=0.2, which decreases gradually with
   further increase in Zn ratio. After adding center dot OH sensitive

Abstract = {{A human-systems perspective is a fruitful approach to understanding home
   health care because it emphasizes major individual components of the
   system persons, equipment/technology, tasks, and environments as well as
   the interaction between these components. The goal of this research was
   to apply a human-system perspective to consider the capabilities and
   limitations of the persons, in relation to the demands of the tasks and
   equipment/technology in home health care. Identification of challenges
   and mismatches between the person(s) capabilities and the demands of
   providing care provide guidance for human factors interventions. A
   qualitative study was conducted with 8 home health Certified Nursing
   Assistants and 8 home health Registered Nurses interviewed about
   challenges they encounter in their jobs. A systematic categorization of
   the challenges the care providers reported was conducted and human
   factors recommendations were proposed in response, to improve home
   health. The challenges inform a human-systems model of home health care.

Abstract = {{Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) are apex predators in
   the Pearl River Estuary waters (PRE) of China. PCBs, DDTs and other
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (e.g., HCHs, HCB, mirex and dieldrin)
   were analysed in blubber samples of 45 dolphins and 10 prey fishes of S.
   chinensis collected from 2004 to 2013 in the PRE region to investigate
   the bioaccumulation and potential biomagnification of persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs). DDTs were the most abundant residue in the dolphins,
   with an average of 62700 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww), followed by PCBs
   (average: 1790 ng g(-1) ww) and other OCPs including Sigma HCHs, mirex,
   endrin, Sigma chlordanes, HCB, dieldrin, aldrin, heptachlor, and
   pentachlorobenzene. The concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in male dolphins
   significantly increased with age and length. In contrast, female
   dolphins did not show obvious bioaccumulation trends with age and body
   length, possibly due to the lactational and parturitional transfer of
   these compounds. Compared with the POP residues in the prey fishes, the
   concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, and HCHs in the dolphin blubber increased
   by factors of 99, 212, and 5, respectively, whereas the residue levels
   of the other OCPs increased 2-185 times, indicating a potentially
   significant biomagnification in the top predators. The potential
   biomagnification factors calculated for most POPs were significantly
   higher than those in the cetacean species from other regions. (C) 2014

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{112-119}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The relative volumes and the viscosities of four Diesel fuels have been
   measured experimentally to pressures up to 350 MPa and temperatures to
   160 degrees C. The experimental liquids were an extra low viscosity
   reference fuel, an ethanol based blend, neat biodiesel and 20\%
   biodiesel. The Tait and Murnaghan equations of state represented the
   pressure-volume-temperature response equally well. The improved Yasutomi
   model for supercooling liquids, which accurately represents the
   temperature and pressure dependence of the viscosity of lubricating
   oils, did not fit the data well except for neat biodiesel. Surprisingly,
   the Doolittle free-volume equation was accurate only for the low
   viscosity reference fuel. The reason for the correlation difficulties
   may be illuminated by the behavior of the thermodynamic scaling of the
   viscosities. The Stickel analysis of the normalized Ashurst-Hoover
   parameter indicates that, for all liquids except the reference fuel, the
   measured viscosities lie across the transition in the response of
   viscosity to temperature and pressure. Consequently, only the
   comprehensive normalized Ashurst-Hoover scaling model successfully fits
   all data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High accuracy and low cost are challenging requirements for localization
   in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The radio interferometric
   positioning system (RIPS) proposed in {[}1] aims to meet both
   requirements at the same time. However, it is vulnerable to channel
   fading, and suffers from the noise aggravation due to the square
   operation. In this paper, we propose a dual-tone radio interferometric
   positioning system(DRIPS) using undersampling techniques, named uDRIPS.
   Our proposed methodology is immune to flat fading effects, and avoids
   the amplification of measurement noise by directly undersampling the
   received signal. Furthermore, the time-of-arrival (TOA) information is
   extracted from the phases of the received dual-tone signals in the
   uDRIPS. As a result, it is able to localize an asynchronous target with
   the help of synchronous anchors (nodes with known positions). Moreover,
   we investigate the integer ambiguity problem due to phase wrapping, and
   develop a localization algorithm to estimate the unknowns alternatively.
   Simulation results corroborate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{17-30}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the experimental characterization of polymer matrix and
   polymer based carbon fiber reinforced composite laminate by employing a
   whole field non-contact digital image correlation (DIC) technique is
   presented. The properties are evaluated based on full field data
   obtained from DIC measurements by performing a series of tests as per
   ASTM standards. The evaluated properties are compared with the results
   obtained from conventional testing and analytical models and they are
   found to closely match. Further, sensitivity of DIC parameters on
   material properties is investigated and their optimum value is
   identified. It is found that the subset size has more influence on
   material properties as compared to step size and their predicted optimum
   value for the case of both matrix and composite material is found
   consistent with each other. The aspect ratio of region of interest (ROI)
   chosen for correlation should be the same as that of camera resolution
   aspect ratio for better correlation. Also, an open cutout panel made of
   the same composite laminate is taken into consideration to demonstrate
   the sensitivity of DIC parameters on predicting complex strain field
   surrounding the hole. It is observed that the strain field surrounding
   the hole is much more sensitive to step size rather than subset size.
   Lower step size produced highly pixilated strain field, showing
   sensitivity of local strain at the expense of computational time in
   addition with random scattered noisy pattern whereas higher step size
   mitigates the noisy pattern at the expense of losing the details present
   in data and even alters the natural trend of strain field leading to
   erroneous maximum strain locations. The subset size variation mainly
   presents a smoothing effect, eliminating noise from strain field while
   maintaining the details in the data without altering their natural
   trend. However, the increase in subset size significantly reduces the
   strain data at hole edge due to discontinuity in correlation. Also, the
   DIC results are compared with FEA prediction to ascertain the suitable
   value of DIC parameters towards better accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the human perception capabilities for haptic
   interaction with remote environments. The perception capabilities are
   compared for two well-known control methods with two kinds of haptic
   cues. Analytical and psychophysical methods are used to analyze the
   performance. The first control method aims at maximizing the
   transparency of the remote interactions (i.e., transparency-based
   method), whereas the second one aims at maximizing the detection and
   discrimination abilities of the human operator (i.e., perception-based
   method). For each of these two control methods, two kinds of haptic cues
   are studied, which use position and force cues from remote environments.
   Hybrid matrix formulation is employed, and it is analyzed in the
   frequency domain for these studies. Psychophysical experiments are then
   conducted for human-centered evaluation and comparison of the control
   methods. Analytical and experimental results clearly show that the
   perception-based method, when compared with the transparency-based
   method, enhances the human operator's perceptual capabilities of remote
   environments irrespective of force cues. For each of the two control
   methods, the force cues always contribute more to the increase in
   perceptual sensitivity when compared with the case of position cues.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we define the Range LCP problem as follows. Preprocess a

   query: Given {[}i, j], O < i <= j <= n, compute max(l,ke{[}i..j])
   LCP(S-l, S-k), where LCP(S-l, S-k) is the length of the longest common
   prefix of the suffixes of S starting at locations t and k. This is a
   natural generalization of the classical LCP problem. We provide
   algorithms with the following complexities:
   1. Preprocessing Time: O(|S|), Space: O(|5|), Query Time: O(|j - i| log
   logn).
   2. Preprocessing Time: none, space: O(|j - i| log |j - i|), Query Time:
   O (|j - i| log |j - i|). However, the query just gives the pairs with
   the longest LCP, not the LCP itself.
   3. Preprocessing Time: O(|S| log(2) |S|), Space: O(|S| log(1+epsilon)
   |S|) for arbitrary small constant epsilon, Query Time: O(log log |S|).

Abstract = {{With the development of chromium tolerant electrode materials, the
   evaluation of the chromium deposition and poisoning on electrolyte is
   critical significance for the commercial and widespread application of
   solid oxide fuel cell stacks (SOFCs). The Cr deposition and poisoning on
   BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta(BZCY) proton conducting electrolyte are
   initially studied, in order to understand and develop the compatibility
   for proton conducting SOFC (H-SOFCs). The XRD results imply that Cr2O3
   is not chemically compatible with BZCY and BaCrO4 is formed at high
   temperature above 600 degrees C. To simulate the Cr volatilization from
   interconnect and poisoning on BZCY surface, the BZCY bar sample is
   heat-treated in the presence of Cr2O3 at 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C,
   and 800 degrees C for 50 h. It is clear that Cr deposition occurs even
   at 600 C by SEM examination. The XPS results indicate the chemical
   deposition of BaCrO4 and physical deposition of Cr2O3 on BZCY surface at
   600 degrees C but only chemical deposition at 700 degrees C and 800
   degrees C. The content of Cr deposition increases with the increase of
   poisoning temperature. Moreover, the proton conductivity of BZCY after
   Cr deposition reduces after Cr deposition, indicating the Cr poisoning
   effect of the electrochemical performance of BZCY electrolyte. Copyright

Abstract = {{Combination chemotherapy with multiple drugs has been widely applied to
   cancer treatment owing to enhanced efficacy and reduced drug resistance.
   For drug combination experiment analysis, response surface modeling has
   been commonly adopted. In this paper, we introduce a Hill-based global
   response surface model and provide an application of the model to a
   512-run drug combination experiment with three chemicals, namely AG490,
   U0126, and indirubin-3'-monoxime (I-3-M), on lung cancer cells. The
   results demonstrate generally improved goodness of fit of our model from
   the traditional polynomial model, as well as the original Hill model on
   the basis of fixedratio drug combinations. We identify different
   dose-effect patterns between normal and cancer cells on the basis of our
   model, which indicates the potential effectiveness of the drug
   combination in cancer treatment. Meanwhile, drug interactions are
   analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The distinct interaction
   patterns between U0126 and I-3-M on two types of cells uncovered by the
   model could be a further indicator of the efficacy of the drug
   combination. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Matching experimental and theoretical approaches have often been
   fruitful in the investigation of complex biological processes. Here we
   develop a novel non-conventional model for the denitrification of waste
   water. Earlier models of the denitrification process were compiled by
   the International Association on Water Quality group. The Activated
   Sludge Models 1-3, which are the most frequently used all over the
   world, are presently not adapted towards the integration of both nitrous
   and nitric oxide emissions during the denitrification process. In the
   present work, a Generalized Mass Action model, based on Biochemical
   Systems Theory, was designed to simulate the nitrate reduction observed
   in specific experimental conditions. The model was implemented and
   analysed with the software package PLAS. Data from a representative
   experiment were chosen (T-10 degrees C, pH-7, C/N-3, with acetate as
   carbon source) to simulate greenhouse NO and N2O gas emissions, in order
   to test hypotheses about the corresponding bacterial metabolic pathways.
   The results show that the reduction of nitrate and nitrite is
   kinetically limiting and that nitrate reduction is limited by diffusion
   and support that distinct microbial subpopulations are involved in the
   denitrification pathway, which has consequences for NO emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a layered semiconducting material with a
   tunable bandgap that is promising for the next generation
   nanoelectronics as a substitute for graphene or silicon. Despite recent
   progress, the synthesis of high-quality and highly uniform MoS2 on a
   large scale is still a challenge. In this work, a temperature-dependent
   synthesis study of large-area MoS2 by direct sulfurization of evaporated
   Mo thin films on SiO2 is presented. A variety of physical
   characterization techniques is employed to investigate the structural
   quality of the material. The film quality is shown to be similar to
   geological MoS2, if synthesized at sufficiently high temperatures (1050
   degrees C). In addition, a highly uniform growth of trilayer MoS2 with
   an unprecedented uniformity of +/- 0.07 nm over a large area (> 10
   cm(2)) is achieved. These films are used to fabricate field-effect
   transistors following a straightforward wafer-scale UV lithography
   process. The intrinsic field-effect mobility is estimated to be about
   6.5 +/- 2.2 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and compared to previous studies. These
   results represent a significant step towards application of MoS2 in
   nanoelectronics and sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Unimolecular coreshell and hollow polymer nanoparticles with
   well-defined dimensions were crafted using spherical coreshell star-like
   diblock copolymers as templates. Monodisperse and structurally stable
   star-like diblock copolymers composed of inner degradable core blocks
   and outer photo-cross-linkable shell blocks were synthesized via a
   combination of two living polymerization techniques, namely,
   coordinationinsertion ring opening polymerization (ROP) followed by
   reversible additionfragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT).
   Subsequently, uniform unimolecular coreshell nanoparticles were
   successfully produced by photo-cross-linking the shell blocks of
   star-like diblock copolymers. The core diameter and shell thickness of
   nanoparticles are determined by molecular weights of inner core block
   and outer shell block, respectively, thereby rendering nanoparticles
   with tunable structural characteristics. The cross-linking density of
   nanoparticles can be readily controlled by varying the exposure time of
   star-like diblock copolymer templates to UV illumination. The selective
   degradation of inner core blocks yielded hollow polymer nanoparticles
   which retained structural integrity. The dye encapsulation and release
   studies revealed that unimolecular coreshell nanoparticles may be
   exploited as a new class of nanocarriers and promising drug

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Molecular surveys are revealing diverse eukaryotic assemblages in
   oxygen-limited ocean waters. These communities may play pivotal
   ecological roles through autotrophy, feeding, and a wide range of
   symbiotic associations with prokaryotes. We used 18S rRNA gene
   sequencing to provide the first snapshot of pelagic microeukaryotic
   community structure in two cellular size fractions (0.2-1.6 mu m, > 1.6
   mu m) from seven depths through the anoxic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off
   northern Chile. Sequencing of > 154,000 amplicons revealed contrasting
   patterns of phylogenetic diversity across size fractions and depths.
   Protist and total eukaryote diversity in the > 1.6 mu m fraction peaked
   at the chlorophyll maximum in the upper photic zone before declining by
   similar to 50\% in the OMZ. In contrast, diversity in the 0.2-1.6 mu m
   fraction, though also elevated in the upper photo zone, increased
   four-fold from the lower oxycline to a maximum at the anoxic OMZ core.
   Dinoflagellates of the Dinophyceae and endosymbiotic Syndiniales clades
   dominated the protist assemblage at all depths (similar to 40-70\% of
   sequences). Other protist groups varied with depth, with the anoxic zone
   community of the larger size fraction enriched in euglenozoan
   flagellates and acantharean radiolarians (up to 18 and 40\% of all
   sequences, respectively). The OMZ 0.2-1.6 mu m fraction was dominated
   (11-99\%) by Syndiniales, which exhibited depth-specific variation in
   composition and total richness despite uniform oxygen conditions.
   Metazoan sequences, though confined primarily to the 1.6 mu m fraction
   above the OMZ, were also detected within the anoxic zone where groups
   such as copepods increased in abundance relative to the oxycline and
   upper OMZ. These data, compared to those from other low-oxygen sites,
   reveal variation in OMZ microeukaryote composition, helping to identify
   clades with potential adaptations to oxygen-depletion.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen grains have the potential to be effective plant-based
   biorenewable reinforcing fillers for polymers due to their high
   mechanical strength, chemical stability, and unique micro- and
   nano-structured surfaces. Pollen polymer composites could form the basis
   for a new class of light-weight, high strength sustainable materials if
   compatible polymer filler systems can be engineered. The exine shell of
   pollen, composed of sporopollenin, offers opportunities for surface
   functionalization to provide for compatibility between the pollen and
   the polymer matrix, but this idea has been previously unexplored. We
   present the first demonstration of surface functionalization of
   sporopollenin to enable, incorporation of pollen as a reinforcing
   filler, using ragweed pollen in poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc). Composites
   prepared with `as received', untreated ragweed pollen displayed
   interfacial voids, degraded mechanical properties, and a decreased glass
   transition width with increased pollen loading, relative to neat PVAc.
   Composites prepared with pollen treated via an acid base surface
   preparation displayed improved interfacial morphology and increasing
   modulus with pollen loading (29\% increase). Interfacial adhesion was
   optimal for pollen functionalized with vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS),
   followed by in situ free radical polymerization of PVAc. In situ
   polymerization of functionalized pollen resulted in simultaneous
   stiffening and strengthening of composites (80\% increase in tensile
   strength). Films containing treated and functionalized pollen also
   displayed a wider glass transition regions in the presence of pollen
   filler relative to neat PVAc.}},

Title = {{The genome of the intracellular bacterium of the coastal bivalve,
   Solemya velum: a blueprint for thriving in and out of symbiosis}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Symbioses between chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine
   invertebrates are rare examples of living systems that are virtually
   independent of photosynthetic primary production. These associations
   have evolved multiple times in marine habitats, such as deep-sea
   hydrothermal vents and reducing sediments, characterized by steep
   gradients of oxygen and reduced chemicals. Due to difficulties
   associated with maintaining these symbioses in the laboratory and
   culturing the symbiotic bacteria, studies of chemosynthetic symbioses
   rely heavily on culture independent methods. The symbiosis between the
   coastal bivalve, Solemya velum, and its intracellular symbiont is a
   model for chemosynthetic symbioses given its accessibility in intertidal
   environments and the ability to maintain it under laboratory conditions.
   To better understand this symbiosis, the genome of the S. velum
   endosymbiont was sequenced.
   Results: Relative to the genomes of obligate symbiotic bacteria, which
   commonly undergo erosion and reduction, the S. velum symbiont genome was
   large (2.7 Mb), GC-rich (51\%), and contained a large number (78) of
   mobile genetic elements. Comparative genomics identified sets of genes
   specific to the chemosynthetic lifestyle and necessary to sustain the
   symbiosis. In addition, a number of inferred metabolic pathways and
   cellular processes, including heterotrophy, branched electron transport,
   and motility, suggested that besides the ability to function as an
   endosymbiont, the bacterium may have the capacity to live outside the
   host.
   Conclusions: The physiological dexterity indicated by the genome
   substantially improves our understanding of the genetic and metabolic
   capabilities of the S. velum symbiont and the breadth of niches the
   partners may inhabit during their lifecycle.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we have revisited the charge-transfer crystal system
   peryleneTCNQ and found that this complex can crystallize with a 2:1
   stoichiometric ratio in addition to the 1:1 and 3:1 stoichiometries
   previously observed. The vibrational and electronic properties of these
   peryleneTCNQ charge-transfer crystals have been investigated by means of
   Raman scattering measurements and density functional theory
   calculations. Electrical measurements were also performed by preparing
   organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) from the crystals. The Raman
   spectra in the low-frequency range (below 200 cm(1)) are found to be
   unique to the specific crystal structure and can therefore be used to
   determine the stoichiometry. The Raman data and the X-ray diffraction
   measurements indicate that at room temperature the amount of charge
   transferred to the TCNQ molecule is less than 0.2e for all three
   compounds, and is nearly the same in P1T1 and P2T1 but is slightly
   larger in P3T1. The electronic structure calculations suggest good
   intrinsic charge transport properties for both holes and electrons in
   P1T1 and P2T1 and only for holes in P3T1. Ambipolar charge transport
   characteristics were found for P2T1 and hole and electron charge
   transport characteristics were found in P3T1 and P1T1, respectively.}},

Title = {{Piezoelectricity of single-atomic-layer MoS2 for energy conversion and

Abstract = {{The piezoelectric characteristics of nanowires, thin films and bulk
   crystals have been closely studied for potential applications in
   sensors, transducers, energy conversion and electronics(1-3). With their
   high crystallinity and ability to withstand enormous strain(4-6),
   two-dimensional materials are of great interest as high-performance
   piezoelectric materials. Monolayer MoS2 is predicted to be strongly
   piezoelectric, an effect that disappears in the bulk owing to the
   opposite orientations of adjacent atomic layers(7,8). Here we report the
   first experimental study of the piezoelectric properties of
   two-dimensional MoS2 and show that cyclic stretching and releasing of
   thin MoS2 flakes with an odd number of atomic layers produces
   oscillating piezoelectric voltage and current outputs, whereas no output
   is observed for flakes with an even number of layers. A single monolayer
   flake strained by 0.53\% generates a peak output of 15 mV and 20 pA,
   corresponding to a power density of 2 mW m(-2) and a 5.08\%
   mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency. In agreement with
   theoretical predictions, the output increases with decreasing thickness
   and reverses sign when the strain direction is rotated by 90 degrees.
   Transport measurements show a strong piezotronic effect in single-layer
   MoS2, but not in bilayer and bulk MoS2. The coupling between
   piezoelectricity and semiconducting properties in two-dimensional
   nanomaterials may enable the development of applications in powering
   nanodevices, adaptive bioprobes and tunable/stretchable
   electronics/optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotwinned microstructures are of significant interest due to their
   high strength and enhanced thermal stability, attributed to the presence
   of a dense network of coherent twin interfaces. Propensity for twinning
   during deformation is known to increase at low temperature and/or
   high-strain-rate. In this study, we use high-strain-rate (\~{}10(3
   )s(-1)) shear deformation in cutting over a range of strains (gamma
   \~{}1-5) and temperatures (cryogenic to ambient) to engineer a variety
   of microstructures in three face-centred cubic (FCC) metals - copper,
   brass and aluminium. The microstructures include
   nanocrystalline-equiaxed and densely (nano) twinned types of
   controllable domain size. The effects of low-temperature deformation and
   stacking fault energy on the resulting microstructure, hardening, stored
   energy and associated recrystallization kinetics are established. For
   copper, the nanotwinned microstructures are found to be thermally more
   stable and stronger than the equiaxed counterparts comprised of random
   high-angle grain boundaries. This enhanced effect of nanotwins on
   microstructure stability is, however, not observed in brass, while
   aluminium did not show any indications of twinning over the investigated
   range of deformation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and organic/water separation properties of
   mesoporous silica membranes, supported on low-cost and scalable
   polymeric (polyamide-imide) hollow fibers, and modified by
   trimethylsilylation with hexamethyldisilazane. Thin (similar to 1 mu m)
   defect-free membranes are prepared, with high room-temperature gas
   permeances (e.g., 20 000 GPU for N2). The membrane morphology is
   characterized by multiple techniques, including SEM, TEM, XRD, and
   FT-ATR spectroscopy. Silylation leads to capping of the surface silanol
   groups in the mesopores with trimethylsilyl groups, and does not affect
   the integrity of the mesoporous silica structure and the underlying
   hollow fiber. The silylated membranes are evaluated for pervaporative
   separation of ethanol (EtOH), methylethyl ketone (MEK), ethyl acetate
   (EA), iso-butanol (i-BuOH), and n-butanol (n-BuOH) from their dilute (5
   wt \%) aqueous solutions. The membranes show separation factors in the
   range of 4-90 and high organic fluxes in the range of 0.18-2.15 kg m(-2)
   h(-1) at 303 K. The intrinsic selectivities (organic/water permeability
   ratios) of the silylated membranes at 303 K are 0.33 (EtOH/water), 0.5
   (MEK/water), 0.25 (EA/water), 1.25 (i-BuOH/water), and 1.67
   (n-BuOH/water) respectively, in comparison to 0.05, 0.015, 0.005, 0.08,
   and 0.14 for the unmodified membranes. The silylated membranes allow
   upgradation of water/organics feeds to permeate streams with
   considerably higher organics content. The selective and high-flux
   separation is attributed to both the organophilic nature of the modified
   mesopores and the large effective pore size. Comparison with other
   organics/water separation membranes reveals that the present membranes
   show promise due to high flux, use of scalable and low-cost supports,
   and good separation factors that can be further enhanced by tailoring
   the mesopore silylation chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrated magnesium silicate (Mg3Si4O10(OH)(2)), commonly known as talc,
   is a direct carbonation agent. In this study, we investigated the
   utility of the carbonation reaction for CO2 adsorption. To gain insight
   into talc carbonation, we performed CO2
   temperature-programmed-desorption and dynamic flow system experiments.
   Structural modifications proved that CO2 adsorption occurred on the
   surface of the talc adsorbents to form carbonates. We achieved stable
   carbonation activities of talc by varying the temperature. In addition,
   the reaction kinetic model of talc carbonation based on the changes of
   CO2 concentration was developed. From the observation that the
   activation energy of talc-based carbonation using the Arrhenius equation
   is 51.4 +/- 4.8 kJ/mol, it is inferred that the chemical reaction is a
   rate-determining step for talc sequestration, based on relatively high
   activation energy.}},

Abstract = {{A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was integrated with flat sheet membrane
   bioreactor (MBR) and studied for electricity generation, membrane
   fouling mitigation and artificial wastewater treatment. The cell
   potential was similar to 0.2 V with 100 Omega external load during
   closed circuit operation. Batch tests identified that the sludge
   properties and aeration in cathodic chamber were the main affecting
   factors on electricity generation. Integration of microbial fuel cell
   can significantly alleviate membrane fouling, under closed circuit
   condition, membrane filtration lasted 21 days - 27 days and under the
   open circuit condition it lasted only 13 days - 15 days, before the
   transmembrane pressure (TMP) reached 0.03 MPa. The calculated
   electrostatic repulsion force between membrane surface and membrane
   foulant was about 2.5 x 10(-14) N in this integrated reactor. The
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus and offensive
   smell could be effectively removed by the sequential anaerobic-aerobic
   treatment system. The effluent pH was neutral and turbidity was very

Abstract = {{Combined reaction separation processes are a widely explored method to
   produce hydrogen from endothermic steam reforming of hydrocarbon
   feedstock at a reduced reaction temperature and with fewer unit
   operation steps, both of which are key requirements for energy
   efficient, distributed hydrogen production. This work introduces a new
   class of variable volume batch reactors for production of hydrogen from
   catalytic steam reforming of methane that operates in a cycle similar to
   that of an internal combustion engine. It incorporates a CO2 adsorbent
   and a selectively permeable hydrogen membrane for in situ removal of the
   two major products of the reversible steam methane reforming reaction.
   Thermodynamic analysis is employed to define an envelope of ideal
   reactor performance and to explore the tradeoff between thermal
   efficiency and hydrogen yield density with respect to critical operating
   parameters, including sorbent mass, steam to methane ratio and fraction
   of product gas recycled. Particular attention is paid to contrasting the
   variable volume batch-membrane reactor approach to a conventional fixed
   bed reaction separation approach. The results indicates that the
   proposed reactor is a viable option for low temperature distributed
   production of hydrogen from methane, the primary component of natural
   gas feedstock, motivating a detailed study of reaction/adsorption
   kinetics and heat/mass transfer effects. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen

Title = {{Pyroelectric-field driven defects diffusion along c-axis in ZnO
   nanobelts under high-energy electron beam irradiation}},

Abstract = {{When ZnO nanobelts are exposed to a high-dose electron probe of several
   nanometers to hundred nanometers in diameter inside a transmission
   electron microscope, due to the radiolysis effect, part of oxygen atoms
   will be ejected into the vacuum and leaving a Zn-ion rich surface with a
   pit appearance at both the electron-entrance and electron-exit surfaces.
   At the same time, a temperature distribution is created around the
   electron probe due to local beam heating effect, which generates a
   unidirectional pyroelectric field. This pyroelectric field is strong
   enough to drive Zn ions moving along its positive c-axis direction as
   interstitial ions. In the first case, for the ZnO nanobelts with c-axis
   lie in their large surfaces, defects due to the aggregation of Zn
   interstitial ions will be formed at some distances of 30-50 nm
   approximately along the c-axis direction from the electron beam
   illuminated area. Alternatively, for the ZnO nanobelts with +/-(0001)
   planes as their large surfaces, the incident electron beam is along its
   c-axis and the generated pyroelectric field will drive the interstitial
   Zn-ions to aggregate at the Zn terminated (0001) surface where the local
   electrical potential is the lowest. Such electron beam induced damage in
   ZnO nanostructures is suggested as a result of Zn ion diffusion driven
   by the temperature gradient induced pyroelectric field along c-axis. Our
   study shows a radiation damage caused by electron beam in transmission
   electron microscopy, especially when the electron energy is high. (C)

Abstract = {{The structure, phase stability, and mechanical properties of ternary
   alloys of the Zr-Ta-N system are investigated by combining thin-film
   growth and ab initio calculations. Zr1-xTaxN films with 0 <= x <= 1 were
   deposited by reactive magnetron cosputtering in Ar + N-2 plasma
   discharge and their structural properties characterized by x-ray
   diffraction. We considered both ordered and disordered alloys, using
   supercells and special quasirandom structure approaches, to account for
   different possible metal atom distributions on the cation sublattice.
   Density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation
   was employed to calculate the electronic structure as well as predict
   the evolution of the lattice parameter and key mechanical properties,
   including single-crystal elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic
   moduli, of ternary Zr1-xTaxN compounds with cubic rocksalt structure.
   These calculated values are compared with experimental data from
   thin-film measurements using Brillouin light scattering and
   nanoindentation tests. We also study the validity of Vegard's empirical
   rule and the effect of growth-dependent stresses on the lattice
   parameter. The thermal stability of these Zr1-xTaxN films is also
   studied, based on their structural and mechanical response upon vacuum
   annealing at 850 degrees C for 3 h. Our findings demonstrate that
   Zr1-xTaxN alloys with Ta fraction 0.51 <= x <= 0.78 exhibit enhanced
   toughness, while retaining high hardness similar to 30 GPa, as a result
   of increased valence electron concentration and phase stability tuning.
   Calculations performed for disordered or ordered structures both lead to
   the same conclusion regarding the mechanical behavior of these nitride
   alloys, in agreement with recent literature findings {[}H. Kindlund, D.

Title = {{Impact of exact exchange in the description of the electronic structure
   of organic charge-transfer molecular crystals}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{We evaluate the impact that the amount of nonlocal Hartree-Fock (\%HF)
   exchange included in a hybrid density functional has on the microscopic
   parameters (transfer integrals, band gaps, bandwidths, and effective
   masses) describing charge transport in high-mobility organic crystals.
   We consider both crystals based on a single molecule, such as pentacene,
   and crystals based on mixed-stack charge-transfer systems, such as
   dibenzo-TTF-TCNQ. In the pentacene crystal, the band gap decreases and
   the effective masses increase linearly with an increase in the amount of
   \%HF exchange. In contrast, in the charge-transfer crystals, while the
   band gap increases linearly, the effective masses vary only slightly
   with an increase in \%HF exchange. We show that the superexchange nature
   of the electronic couplings in charge-transfer systems is responsible
   for this peculiar evolution of the effective masses. We compare the
   density functional theory results with results obtained within the
   G(0)W(0) approximation as a way of benchmarking the optimal amount of
   \%HF exchange needed in a given functional.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how biological systems transduce dynamic, soluble chemical
   cues into physiological processes requires robust experimental tools for
   generating diverse temporal chemical patterns. The advent of
   microfluidics has seen the development of platforms for rapid fluid
   exchange allowing ease of changes in the cellular microenvironment and
   precise cell handling. Rapid exchange is important for exposing systems
   to temporally varying signals. However, direct coupling of macroscale
   fluid flow with microstructures is potentially problematic due to the
   high shear stresses that inevitably add confounding mechanical
   perturbation effects to the biological system of interest. Here, we have
   devised a method of translating fast and precise macroscale flows to
   microscale flows using a monolithically integrated perforated membrane.
   We integrated a high-density cell trap array for nonadherent cells that
   are challenging to handle under flow conditions with a soluble chemical
   signal generator module. The platform enables fast and repeatable
   switching of stimulus and buffer at low shear stresses for quantitative
   live, single-cell fluorescent studies. This modular design allows facile
   integration of any cell-handling chip design with any chemical delivery
   module. We demonstrate the utility of this device by characterizing
   heterogeneity of oscillatory response for cells exposed to alternating
   Ca(2+) waveforms at various periodicities. This platform enables the
   analysis of cell responses to chemical perturbations at a single-cell
   resolution that is necessary in understanding signal transduction
   pathways.}},

Title = {{Cultured Human Bone Marrow-Derived CD31(+) Cells Are Effective for
   Cardiac and Vascular Repair Through Enhanced Angiogenic, Adhesion, and
   Anti-Inflammatory Effects}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Cell therapy for cardiovascular disease has been limited by
   low engraftment of administered cells and modest therapeutic effects.
   Bone marrow (BM) -derived CD31(+) cells are a promising cell source
   owing to their high angiovasculogenic and paracrine activities.
   OBJECTIVES This study sought to identify culture conditions that could
   augment the cell adhesion, angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory activities
   of BM-derived CD31(+) cells, and to determine whether these cultured
   CD31(+) cells are effective for cardiac and vascular repair.
   METHODS CD31(+) cells were isolated from human BM by magnetic-activated
   cell sorting and cultured for 10 days under hematopoietic stem cell,
   mesenchymal stem cell, or endothelial cell culture conditions. These
   cells were characterized by adhesion, angiogenesis, and inflammatory
   assays. The best of the cultured cells were implanted into myocardial
   infarction (MI) and hindlimb ischemia (HLI) models to determine
   therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms.
   RESULTS The CD31(+) cells cultured in endothelial cell medium
   (EC-CD31(+) cells) showed the highest adhesion and angiogenic activities
   and lowest inflammatory properties in vitro compared with uncultured or
   other cultured CD31(+) cells. When implanted into mouse MI or HLI
   models, EC-CD31(+) cells improved cardiac function and repaired limb
   ischemia to a greater extent than uncultured CD31(+) cells.
   Histologically, injected EC-CD31(+) cells exhibited higher retention,
   neovascularization, and cardiomyocyte proliferation. Importantly, cell
   retention and endothelial transdifferentiation was sustained up to 1
   year.
   CONCLUSIONS Short-term cultured EC-CD31(+) cells have higher cell
   engraftment, vessel-formation, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and
   anti-inflammatory potential, are highly effective for both cardiac and
   peripheral vascular repair, and enhance survival of mice with heart
   failure. These cultured CD31(+) cells may be a promising source for
   treating ischemic cardiovascular diseases. (C) 2014 by the American

Abstract = {{The sol-gel process and electrospinning were used to fabricate a series
   of silica/Nafion electrospun hybrid products with no aggregation of the
   inorganic component. The excellent flexibility of the as-obtained

   demonstrated and compared with the brittleness of pure electrospun
   silica membrane. The difference in wettability between the electrospun
   silica/Nafion hybrid product and bulk aqueous sal could be caused by the
   molecular orientation of Nafion during the electrospinning process. The
   hydrophobic behaviour, improved mechanical performance and good thermal
   stability made the silica/Nafion hybrid membrane a good candidate for
   oil water separation. One-dimensional periodic structures still formed
   in silica/Nafion hybrid products with a lower Nafion content, although

Title = {{Understanding pop-ins in spherical nanoindentation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Pop-ins, or sudden displacement-bursts at constant load in a
   nanoindentation test, are typically attributed to the difficulty of
   setting up potent dislocation sources in the very small indentation
   zones in these experiments. Such displacement (and strain) bursts would
   intuitively indicate a sharp drop in stress during the pop-in event
   itself. However, spherical indentation stress-strain curves routinely
   exhibit a high and stable indentation stress value during the pop-in,
   and the indentation stresses decrease only after a further finite amount
   of additional indentation displacement has been applied. In order to
   understand this discrepancy, we utilize a combination of interrupted
   spherical indentation tests along with depth profiling of the residual
   indentation surfaces using in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) to
   study pop-ins. The AFM surface profile maps show that there is an
   asymmetric profile change over a limited region around the indentation
   contact area for a single pop-in; the asymmetry disappears upon further
   loading beyond the pop-in. A plausible sequence of physical processes
   (related to metal plasticity) occurring underneath the indenter during
   and immediately after the occurrence of the pop-in is proposed to
   explain these observations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Polymethine dyes in dilute solutions show many of the electronic and
   optical properties required for all-optical switching applications.
   However, in the form of thin films, their aggregation and interactions
   with counterions do generally strongly limit their utility. Here, we
   present a theoretical approach combining molecular-dynamics simulations
   and quantum-chemical calculations to describe the bulk molecular packing
   of streptocyanines (taken as representative of simple polymethines) with
   counterions of different hardness (Cl and BPh4 ) and understand the
   impact on the optical properties. The accuracy of the force field we use
   is verified by reproducing experimental crystal parameters as well as
   the configurations of polymethine/counterion complexes obtained from
   electronic-structure calculations. The aggregation characteristics can
   be understood in terms of both polymethinecounterion and
   polymethinepolymethine interactions. The counterions are found to
   localize near one end of the streptocyanine backbones, and the
   streptocyanines form a broad range of aggregates with significant
   electronic couplings between neighboring molecules. As a consequence,
   the linear and nonlinear optical properties are substantially modified
   in the bulk. By providing an understanding of the relationship between
   the molecular interactions and the bulk optical properties, our results
   point to a clear strategy for designing polymethine and counterion
   molecular structures and optimizing the materials properties for
   all-optical switching applications.}},

Abstract = {{Several key enabling techniques are introduced for next-generation
   wireless communication systems. Small-cell and cloud-RAN systems have
   been considered as promising solutions to meet the capacity demand of
   the future wireless access networks. In addition, utilization of high
   radio frequency (e.g., millimeter-wave band) is another dimension to
   expand the spectrum to enhance the throughput. From the network
   perspective, a high capacity, low latency, and reliable
   backhaul/fronthaul network is important to support the advanced wireless
   access techniques. Therefore, microwave-photonics techniques can play an
   important role in the integrated optical-wireless access systems for
   next-generation wireless communications. In this paper, we first review
   several key features and enabling techniques for next-generation 5G
   wireless communications. Then, we introduce a multiservice small-cell
   wireless access architecture based on microwave-photonics technologies
   (cloud radio-over-fiber networks). By combining small-cell cloud-RAN
   concept with multiband delivery capability in an integrated
   optical-wireless access system, the proposed architecture can realize
   high-speed multiservice data transmission in a simplified and flexible
   way. An in-building cloud radio-over-fiber testbed was demonstrated with
   real-time WiMAX traffic. Two different approaches of delivering
   conventional services and future-proof high-data-rate millimeter-wave
   services in a converged platform are also analyzed and summarized.}},

Abstract = {{A new reactive separation process concept termed solid-phase reactive
   separation system (SPRSS) is proposed which integrates the progressing
   batch reactor (PBR) and simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography
   processes. The key idea of this new process is that both PBR and SMB
   employ similar principles of the movement of the liquid feed to imitate
   the countercurrent movement of solid and liquid phases. This concept may
   be applied to the reactive separation system that involves solid
   reactants. In this work, SPRSS is applied to the production of sugar
   from cellulosic materials which contain different amounts of cellulose
   and hemicellulose in which the kinetics of each hydrolysis reaction path
   are different. SPRSS enables the variation of these reaction parameters
   within the reactor system to hydrolyze different portions of the
   biomass, which allows more flexible acid catalyst concentration
   profiles. The overarching goal is to improve the total sugar yield and
   concentration while minimizing the sugar decomposition reaction and
   undesired product formation. An optimization strategy using a
   superstructure formulation is applied to find the optimal process design
   of SPRSS using a continuous moving-bed model. The optimal results show a
   potential improvement of the sugar yield as well as less byproduct
   formation by changing the acid concentration using the SPRSS
   configuration design. The effect of different kinetic parameters is
   investigated, which could significantly affect the performance of SPRSS.
   Several observations of the values of these kinetic parameters which
   could further enhance the advantages of SPRSS design are demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Extracting single-crystal elastic constants from polycrystalline samples

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new approach for the extraction of single-crystal
   elastic stiffness parameters from polycrystalline samples using
   spherical nanoindentation and orientation measurements combined with
   finite-element (FE) simulations. The first task of this new approach
   involves capturing efficiently the functional dependence of the
   indentation modulus on the lattice orientation at the indentation site
   and the unknown single-crystal elastic constants. This step is
   accomplished by probing the function of interest using a suitably
   constructed FE model of spherical indentation, and establishing a
   compact spectral representation of the desired function using the
   discrete values obtained from the simulations. Note that this function
   needs to be established only once for a selected crystal lattice
   symmetry. In the second step of the approach presented here, the unknown
   single-crystal elastic constants for a selected phase are estimated
   through a regression technique that provides the best match between
   spherical nanoindentation measurements obtained on differently oriented
   grains of that phase in a polycrystalline sample (measured by
   orientation imaging) and the function established in the first step. The
   accuracy and viability of the proposed approach are demonstrated for an
   as-cast cubic polycrystalline Fe-3\% Si sample. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) pleiotropy is largely due to
   their nonselective inhibition of various cellular HDAC isoforms.
   Connecting inhibition of a specific isoform to biological responses

   The contribution of classes I and II HDACs to the antileishmanial
   activity of HDACi was investigated using the amastigote and promastigote
   forms of Leishmania donovani. We observed that the antileishmanial
   activities of HDACi are largely due to the inhibition of HDAC6-like
   activity. This observation could facilitate the development of HDACi as
   antileishmanial agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides experimental results of bond tests for concrete
   confined by FRP wire jackets and investigates bond behavior. The used
   FRP wire jackets are newly introduced and found to be more effective in
   wrapping around concrete members than conventional FRP sheet jackets.
   Bond-slip tests were conducted by push-out tests using concrete
   cylinders with an embedded rebar at the center of the cylinders. Two
   parameters of concrete strength and amount of confinement were chosen.
   Bond strength and radial strain of concrete are discussed with the
   stiffness ratio of confinement. A method to estimate the increment of
   bond strength due to confinement is suggested. The bond strength of
   confined concrete shows a logarithmic relationship to the stiffness
   ratio of confinement and, thus, there is a limit on how to increase the
   bond strength by external confinement. It is found that radial strain at
   bond strength or the corresponding lateral confining pressure is a
   critical factor to increase bond strength. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We present an Augmented Lagrangian formulation and its real-space
   implementation for non-periodic Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory
   (OF-DFT) calculations. In particular, we rewrite the constrained
   minimization problem of OF-DFT as a sequence of minimization problems
   without any constraint, thereby making it amenable to powerful
   unconstrained optimization algorithms. Further, we develop a parallel
   implementation of this approach for the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker
   (TFW) kinetic energy functional in the framework of higher-order
   finite-differences and the conjugate gradient method. With this
   implementation, we establish that the Augmented Lagrangian approach is
   highly competitive compared to the penalty and Lagrange multiplier
   methods. Additionally, we show that higher-order finite-differences
   represent a computationally efficient discretization for performing
   OF-DFT simulations. Overall, we demonstrate that the proposed
   formulation and implementation are both efficient and robust by studying
   selected examples, including systems consisting of thousands of atoms.
   We validate the accuracy of the computed energies and forces by
   comparing them with those obtained by existing plane-wave methods. (C)

Title = {{Effect of lignin content on changes occurring in poplar cellulose
   ultrastructure during dilute acid pretreatment}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Obtaining a better understanding of the complex mechanisms
   occurring during lignocellulosic deconstruction is critical to the
   continued growth of renewable biofuel production. A key step in
   bioethanol production is thermochemical pretreatment to reduce plant
   cell wall recalcitrance for downstream processes. Previous studies of
   dilute acid pretreatment (DAP) have shown significant changes in
   cellulose ultrastructure that occur during pretreatment, but there is
   still a substantial knowledge gap with respect to the influence of
   lignin on these cellulose ultrastructural changes. This study was
   designed to assess how the presence of lignin influences DAP-induced
   changes in cellulose ultrastructure, which might ultimately have large
   implications with respect to enzymatic deconstruction efforts.
   Results: Native, untreated hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x Populus
   deltoids) samples and a partially delignified poplar sample (facilitated
   by acidic sodium chlorite pulping) were separately pretreated with
   dilute sulfuric acid (0.10 M) at 160 degrees C for 15 minutes and 35
   minutes, respectively. Following extensive characterization, the
   partially delignified biomass displayed more significant changes in
   cellulose ultrastructure following DAP than the native untreated
   biomass. With respect to the native untreated poplar, delignified poplar
   after DAP (in which approximately 40\% lignin removal occurred)
   experienced: increased cellulose accessibility indicated by increased
   Simons' stain (orange dye) adsorption from 21.8 to 72.5 mg/g, decreased
   cellulose weight-average degree of polymerization (DPw) from 3087 to 294
   units, and increased cellulose crystallite size from 2.9 to 4.2 nm.
   These changes following DAP ultimately increased enzymatic sugar yield
   from 10 to 80\%.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results indicate a strong influence of lignin
   content on cellulose ultrastructural changes occurring during DAP. With
   the reduction of lignin content during DAP, the enlargement of cellulose
   microfibril dimensions and crystallite size becomes more apparent.
   Further, this enlargement of cellulose microfibril dimensions is
   attributed to specific processes, including the co-crystallization of
   crystalline cellulose driven by irreversible inter-chain hydrogen
   bonding (similar to hornification) and/or cellulose annealing that
   converts amorphous cellulose to paracrystalline and crystalline
   cellulose. Essentially, lignin acts as a barrier to prevent cellulose
   crystallinity increase and cellulose fibril coalescence during DAP.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Abstract = {{The combination of low elasticity modulus, anisotropy, and
   responsiveness to external fields drives the rich variety of
   experimentally observed pattern formation in nematic liquid crystals
   under capillary confinement. External fields of interest in technology
   and fundamental physics are flow fields, electromagnetic fields, and
   surface fields due to confinement. In this paper we present theoretical
   and simulation studies of the pattern formation of nematic liquid
   crystal disclination loops under capillary confinement including
   branching processes from a m = +1 disclination line to two m = +1/2
   disclination curves that describe the postnucleation and growth regime
   of the textural transformation from radial to planar polar textures. The
   early postnucleation and growth of emerging disclination loops in
   cylindrical capillaries are characterized using analytical and
   computational methods based on the nematic elastica that takes into
   account line tension and line bending stiffness. Using subdiffusive
   growth and constant loop anisotropy, we found that the solution to the
   nematic elastica is a cusped elliptical geometry characterized by
   exponential curvature variations. The scaling laws that govern the loop
   growth reflect the tension to bending elasticity balance and reveal that
   the loop dilation rate depends on the curvature and normal velocity of
   the disclination. The line energy growth is accommodated by the decrease
   in branch-point curvature. These findings contribute to the evolving
   understanding of textural transformations in nematic liquid crystals
   under confinement using the nematic elastic methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen has been widely considered a clean fuel of the future, with the
   highest mass based energy density of known fuels. Water gas shift (WGS)
   and steam reforming (SR) are the major reactions used for hydrogen
   production, and improved catalysts are essential to the future of the
   WGS and SR processes. Much progress in the different aspects of these
   fields has been made recently, which includes approaches to preparation
   and characterization, doping and promotion, as well as evaluation of
   catalysts, especially nanocatalysts. Significant improvements have been
   realized in increasing the stability of the catalysts, the overall
   conversion of raw materials, and the hydrogen production selectivity.
   This review aims to introduce these hydrogen production processes, to
   present developments in these areas, and discusses recent improvements
   that have made noteworthy impacts. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Improved production of alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG) by a Bacillus

Abstract = {{We previously developed a novel one-step biotransformation process for
   the production of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) from L-glutamic acid by
   a Bacillus subtilis whole-cell biocatalyst expressing an L-amino acid
   deaminase (pm1) of Proteus mirabilis. However, the biotransformation
   efficiency of this process was low owing to low substrate specificity
   and high alpha-KG degradation. In this study, we further improved
   alpha-KG production by protein engineering P. mirabilis pm1 and deleting
   the B. subtilis alpha-KG degradation pathway. We first performed three
   rounds of error-prone polymerase chain reaction and identified mutations
   at six sites (F110, A255, E349, R228, T249, and I352) that influence
   catalytic efficiency. We then performed site-saturation mutagenesis at
   these sites, and the mutant F110I/A255T/E349D/R228C/T249S/I352A
   increased the biotransformation ratio of L-glutamic acid from 31\% to
   83.25\% and the alpha-KG titer from 4.65 g/L to 10.08 g/L. Next, the
   reaction kinetics and biochemical properties of the mutant were
   analyzed. The Michaelis constant for L-glutamic acid decreased from
   49.21 mM to 23.58 mM, and the maximum rate of alpha-KG production
   increased from 22.82 mu M min(-1) to 56.7 mu M min(-1). Finally, the
   sucA gene, encoding alpha-ketodehydrogenase, was deleted to reduce
   alpha-KG degradation, increasing the alpha-KG titer from 10.08 g/L to
   12.21 g/L. Protein engineering of P. mirabilis pm1 and deletion of the
   alpha-KG degradation pathway in B. subtilis improved alpha-KG production
   over that of previously developed processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Limbless organisms such as snakes can navigate nearly all terrain. In
   particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes)
   operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that
   induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and
   pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline
   angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their
   body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical
   robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close
   to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments
   demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing
   incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how
   sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular
   media.}},

Abstract = {{The band structures of semiconductor photocatalysts fundamentally
   determine the photocatalytic activity and the H-2 production from the
   visible-light-driven water-splitting reaction. We synthesize a suite of
   multicomponent sulfide photocatalysts, (CuAg)(x)In2xZn2(1-2x)S2 (0x0.5),
   with tunable band gaps and small crystallite sizes to produce H-2 using
   visible-light irradiation. The band gap of the photocatalysts decreases
   from 3.47eV to 1.51eV with the increasing x value. The
   (CuAg)(0.15)In0.3Zn1.4S2 (x=0.15) photocatalyst yielded the highest
   photocatalytic activity for H-2 production owing to the broad
   visible-light absorption range and suitable conduction band potential.
   Under the optimized reaction conditions, the highest H-2 production rate
   is 230 mu molm(-2)h(-1) with a visible-light irradiation of 2.7x10(-5)
   einstein cm(-2)s(-1), and the quantum yield reaches 12.8\% at 420 +/-
   5nm within 24h. Furthermore, the photocatalytic H-2 production is shown
   to strongly depend on their band structures, which vary with the
   elemental ratios and could be analyzed by the Nernst relation. Copyright

Abstract = {{A compact optically controlled ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with
   reconfigurable band-notched characteristics is investigated for
   cognitive radio (CR) applications. The rejection mechanism is realised

   controlling photoconductive switches to change the effective length of
   the folded slot. A prototype with an overall size of 25 x 25 x 0.8 mm(3)

   results, the proposed antenna exhibits good radiation behaviour and
   operates in a wide band with the performance of switchable band
   rejection of the wireless local area network (WLAN) 2.4 GHz (2.2-2.9

   the Si substrate in EMaCE. The 3D geometry of the etching profile was
   effectively controlled by the bias in a real-time manner. The reported
   method successfully fabricated an array of over 10 000 vertical holes
   with diameters of 28 mu m on 1 cm(2) silicon chips at a rate of up to 11
   mu m/min. The sidewall roughness was kept below 50 nm, and a high aspect
   ratio of over 10:1 was achieved. The 3D geometry could be attenuated by
   the variable applied bias in real time. Vertical deep etching was
   realized on (100)-, (111)-Si, and polycrystalline Si substrates. Complex
   features with lateral dimensions of 0.8-500 mu m were also fabricated
   with submicron accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{A new membrane-based triboelectric sensor (M-TES) is presented as a
   self-powered pressure change sensor. It generates a voltage induced by
   surface triboelectric charges in response to an air pressure change.
   Extremely high detection resolutions of 0.34 Pa and 0.16 Pa are achieved
   when the air pressure increases and decreases in a small region away
   from the ambient standard atmosphere pressure, respectively, indicating
   an excellent sensitivity. By integrating the M-TES with a signal
   processing unit, we demonstrate practical applications of the device in
   sensing footsteps, respirations, and heartbeat, which suggests
   widespread use of the M-TES in fields of security surveillance, chemical
   engineering, geography research, environment monitoring, and personal
   healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{As platelets aggregate and activate at the site of vascular injury to
   stem bleeding, they are subjected to a myriad of biochemical and
   biophysical signals and cues. As clot formation ensues, platelets
   interact with polymerizing fibrin scaffolds, exposing platelets to a
   large range of mechanical microenvironments. Here, we show for the first
   time (to our knowledge) that platelets, which are anucleate cellular
   fragments, sense microenvironmental mechanical properties, such as
   substrate stiffness, and transduce those cues into differential
   biological signals. Specifically, as platelets mechanosense the
   stiffness of the underlying fibrin/fibrinogen substrate, increasing
   substrate stiffness leads to increased platelet adhesion and spreading.
   Importantly, adhesion on stiffer substrates also leads to higher levels
   of platelet activation, as measured by integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3)
   activation, a-granule secretion, and procoagulant activity.
   Mechanistically, we determined that Rac1 and actomyosin activity mediate
   substrate stiffness-dependent platelet adhesion, spreading, and
   activation to different degrees. This capability of platelets to
   mechanosense microenvironmental cues in a growing thrombus or hemostatic
   plug and then mechanotransduce those cues into differential levels of
   platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation provides biophysical
   insight into the underlying mechanisms of platelet aggregation and
   platelet activation heterogeneity during thrombus formation.}},

   rehabilitation robots}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Physical interactions between patients and therapists during
   rehabilitation have served as motivation for the design of
   rehabilitation robots, yet we lack a fundamental understanding of the
   principles governing such human-human interactions (HHI). Here we review
   the literature and pose important open questions regarding sensorimotor
   interaction during HHI that could facilitate the design of human-robot
   interactions (HRI) and haptic interfaces for rehabilitation. Based on
   the goals of physical rehabilitation, three subcategories of
   sensorimotor interaction are identified: sensorimotor collaboration,
   sensorimotor assistance, and sensorimotor education. Prior research has
   focused primarily on sensorimotor collaboration and is generally limited
   to relatively constrained visuomotor tasks. Moreover, the mechanisms by
   which performance improvements are achieved during sensorimotor
   cooperation with haptic interaction remains unknown. We propose that the
   effects of role assignment, motor redundancy, and skill level in
   sensorimotor cooperation should be explicitly studied. Additionally, the
   importance of haptic interactions may be better revealed in tasks that
   do not require visual feedback. Finally, cooperative motor tasks that
   allow for motor improvement during solo performance to be examined may
   be particularly relevant for rehabilitation robotics. Identifying
   principles that guide human-human sensorimotor interactions may lead to
   the development of robots that can physically interact with humans in
   more intuitive and biologically inspired ways, thereby enhancing
   rehabilitation outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Optically pumped deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lasing with low threshold was
   demonstrated from AlGaN-based multiple-quantum-well (MQW)
   heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. The epitaxial layers were
   grown pseudomorphically by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on
   (0001) sapphire substrates. Stimulated emission was observed at
   wavelengths of 256 nm and 249 nm with thresholds of 61 kW/cm(2) and 95
   kW/cm(2) at room temperature, respectively. The thresholds are
   comparable to the reported state-of-the-art AlGaN-based MQW DUV lasers
   grown on bulk AlN substrates emitting at 266 nm. These low thresholds
   are attributed to the optimization of active region and waveguide layer
   as well as the use of high-quality AlN/sapphire templates. The
   stimulated emission above threshold was dominated by transverse-electric
   polarization. This work demonstrates the potential candidacy of sapphire
   substrates for DUV diode lasers. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Heat engines utilizing the Stirling cycle may run on low temperature
   differentials with the capacity to function at high efficiency due to
   their near-reversible operation. However, current approaches to building
   Stirling engines are laborious and costly. Typically the components are
   assembled by hand and additional components require a corresponding
   increase in manufacturing complexity, akin to electronics before the
   integrated circuit. We present a simple and integrated approach to
   fabricating Stirling engines with precisely designed cylinders. We
   utilize computer aided design and one-step, planar machining to form all
   components of the engine. The engine utilizes liquid pistons and
   displacers to harness useful work from heat absorption and rejection. As
   a proof of principle of the integrated design, a two-cylinder engine is
   produced and characterized and liquid pumping is demonstrated. (c) 2014

   different stimulated transition modes and the photoexciting pulse.
   Analysis of the final states shows that we can only obtain some
   electron-hole binding states by an external optical excitation for the
   molecule, which includes exciton, biexciton, and high-energy exciton. We
   have calculated their yields and find that they are determined by the
   optical excitation energy. In addition, based on the experimental
   observations, we separately investigate the effect of the optical
   excitation intensity on the yields of biexciton and high-energy exciton.
   The calculated results are consistent with the corresponding
   experimental speculations. Finally, by setting the molecule lying in an
   exciton or a biexciton, we focus on the stimulated emission process
   between their generated intragap states. Effects of the optical
   excitation energy and intensity on them are separately analyzed. These
   results might be of great importance for further improving the optical
   applications of polymers, especially for optimizing the polymer
   photovoltaic and laser properties.}},

Abstract = {{Mn1-xZnxFe2O4 (x = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) nanoparticles with a mean size of
   about 20 nm were synthesized using a mechanochemistry approach, which
   combined ultrasonic irradiation and ball milling processing.
   Experimental results showed that no post-calcination was required for
   the synthesis of manganese-zinc ferrite nanoparticles with perfect
   crystalline lattice and excellent magnetic properties. In order to
   investigate the coupling effect of ultrasonic irradiation and mechanical
   forces, several comparative experiments were carried out including ball
   milling with ultrasonic irradiation, ball milling without ultrasonic
   irradiation, and ultrasonic irradiation without ball milling. The
   relative content of OH radicals in the aqueous solution was tested and
   compared at different times during these processes. Results indicated
   that simultaneous operation of ultrasonic wave and mechanical ball
   milling significantly accelerated the chemical reaction. In addition,
   electrochemical methods were used to measure the relative conductivity
   of the solutions at different times. It can be inferred from the
   measurements that the solution reactivity was the highest during the
   ultrasonic wave-assisted ball milling process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Abstract = {{Pd-Au alloys are known to undergo lattice rearrangement in the presence
   of H and exhibit short range order (SRO). Pd-Au alloys also have
   favorable H permeabilities making them suitable membrane materials for
   hydrogen separation. In this work a method to study the influence of H
   induced lattice rearrangement on the H permeability of Pd96Au4 and
   Pd85Au15 was developed. We used cluster expansion methods in combination
   with density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations to predict
   the extent of ordering induced in the alloys due to hydrogen at various
   pressures and temperatures. Our calculations predict that H-induced
   ordering leads to an increase in H solubility and permeability in
   comparison to alloys that have not been hydrogen heat treated, in
   agreement with previous experimental results. At 600 K and 1 atm H-2,
   the permeability is found to increase by a factor of 5.4 (2.6) in
   Pd96Au4 (Pd85Au15) after hydrogen heat treatment (HHT). At higher
   temperatures, the influence of H-induced ordering is smaller. (C) 2014

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},

Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{1-30}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm
   that separates the network control plane from the data forwarding plane
   with the promise to dramatically improve network resource utilization,
   simplify network management, reduce operating cost, and promote
   innovation and evolution. Although traffic engineering techniques have
   been widely exploited in the past and current data networks, such as ATM
   networks and IP/MPLS networks, to optimize the performance of
   communication networks by dynamically analyzing, predicting, and
   regulating the behavior of the transmitted data, the unique features of
   SDN require new traffic engineering techniques that exploit the global
   network view, status, and flow patterns/characteristics available for
   better traffic control and management. This paper surveys the
   state-of-the-art in traffic engineering for SDNs, and mainly focuses on
   four thrusts including flow management, fault tolerance, topology
   update, and traffic analysis/characterization. In addition, some
   existing and representative traffic engineering tools from both industry
   and academia are explained. Moreover, open research issues for the
   realization of SDN traffic engineering solutions are discussed in

Abstract = {{The Gaussian process (GP) model provides a powerful methodology for
   calibrating a computer model in the presence of model uncertainties.
   However, if the data contain systematic experimental errors, then the GP

   the computer model closer to the data by making minimal changes to it.
   This is achieved by applying a lasso-based variable selection on the

   examples and simulations are presented to demonstrate the advantages of

Journal = {{MACHINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{547-564}},

Abstract = {{Residual stress is one of the critical characteristics for assessing the
   qualities and functionalities of machined products in light of its
   direct effect on endurance limit, distortion, and corrosion resistance.
   Primary factors responsible for residual stresses distribution include
   mechanical effects, thermal effects, microstructure evolutions, and a
   combination of these mechanisms. This study investigates the effects of
   minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) on machining force, temperature and
   residual stress through a physics-based modeling method. Both the
   lubrication and cooling effects caused by MQL air-oil mixture contribute
   to changes in friction due to boundary lubrication as well as variations
   in the thermal stress due to heat loss. The modified Oxley's model is
   employed to predict the cutting force and temperature directly from
   cutting conditions. The predicted cutting force and temperature are then
   coupled into a thermal-mechanical model which incorporates the kinematic
   hardening and strain compatibility to predict the machining-induced
   residual stress under lubricated conditions. The proposed analytical
   method is experimentally verified by orthogonal cutting tests for AISI
   4130 alloy steel in the context of forces, temperatures, and residual
   stresses.}},

   Within this research, we assume that the number of components is

   component discovery under the assumed model. We focus on two aspects.
   One is sensitivity analysis referring to the ability of separating
   regression components from noise. The second is resolution analysis
   referring to the ability of de-mixing components that have similar
   location parameters. We use a wavelet transformation that allows to zoom
   in at different levels of details in the observed data. We further apply
   these theoretical insights to provide a road map on how to detect
   components in more realistic settings such as a two-dimensional nuclear

Abstract = {{Multinomial selection is concerned with selecting the most probable
   (best) multinomial alternative. The alternatives compete in a number of
   independent trials. In each trial, each alternative wins with an unknown
   probability specific to that alternative. A long-standing research goal
   has been to find a procedure that minimizes the expected number of
   trials subject to a lower bound on the probability of correct selection
   (P(CS)). Numerous procedures have been proposed over the past 55 years,
   all of them suboptimal, for the version where the number of trials is
   bounded. We achieve the goal in the following sense: For a given
   multinomial probability vector, lower bound on P(CS), and upper bound on
   trials, we use linear programming (LP) to construct a procedure that is
   guaranteed to minimize the expected number of trials. This optimal
   procedure may necessarily be randomized. We also present a mixed-integer
   linear program (MIP) that produces an optimal deterministic procedure.
   In our computational studies, the MIP always outperforms previously

Abstract = {{The prediction of temperature-dependent fatigue deformation and damage
   in directionally solidified and single-crystal nickel-base superalloy
   components used in the hot section of gas turbine engines requires a
   constitutive model that accounts for the crystal orientation in addition
   to the changing deformation mechanisms and rate dependencies from room
   temperature to extremes of the use temperature (e.g., 1050 degrees C).
   Crystal viscoplasticity (CVP) models are ideal for accounting for all of
   these dependencies. However, as the models become more physically
   realistic in capturing the true cyclic deformation mechanisms, increases
   the requirements to achieve an accurate model calibration. As a result,
   CVP models have yet to become viable for life analysis in industry. To
   make CVP models an industry relevant tool, the calibration times must be
   reduced. This paper explores methods to reduce the calibration time.
   First, a series of special calibration experiments are conceived and
   conducted on each relevant orientation and microstructure. Second, a set
   of parameterization protocols are used to minimize parameter
   interdependencies that reduce the amount of iteration required during
   the calibration. These experimental and calibration protocols are
   exercised using the CVP model of Shenoy et al. (2005, ``Thermomechanical
   Fatigue Behavior of a Directionally Solidified Ni-Base Superalloy,{''}

Abstract = {{The crystallographic orientation or anisotropy is one of the main
   microstructural attributes strongly affecting the mechanical properties
   of materials. It is also an influential parameter to be considered
   during the manufacturing process especially for ultra-precision
   machining since it affects part quality, tool performance, and process
   productivity through material properties. In this study, a prediction
   toolset constituted of a Viscoplastic Self-Consistent model and
   machining process mechanics model is used to predict the texture
   evolution on the machined surface. The VPSC (Viscoplastic
   Self-Consistent) methodology which uses the mechanisms of slip and
   twinning that are active in single crystals of arbitrary symmetry was
   used. For this, an analytical model for the process mechanics is derived
   to understand the forces and stresses generated by the cutting tool at
   each workpiece point, then the strain and strain rate to capture the
   rate at which the material is deforming and finally the crystallographic
   orientations under various machining conditions. Experiments were
   performed on the orthogonal cutting of aluminum alloy AA-7075-T651 and
   the texture results were compared to model predictions. (C) 2014 The

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an improved stochastic process model for the
   selection of categorical variables, such as airfoils and materials, in
   rotorcraft design. This process leverages trends in typical rotorcraft
   conceptual design objectives that are similar across different
   categories. Also, this paper extends the use of efficient global
   optimization (EGO) algorithms, which intelligently search design spaces,
   to the previously proposed stochastic process thereby enabling the use
   of more computationally intensive tools earlier in the design process.
   To optimize the EGO infill criterion, a genetic algorithm is developed
   that is capable of searching domains with categorical variables. The
   proposed stochastic process model is successfully tested against
   traditional independent surrogates when approximating the engine shaft
   horsepower of the UH-60A with a choice of airfoils. Finally, a test to
   optimize the UH-60A engine shaft horsepower at two flight conditions
   demonstrates that the proposed extension of the EGO algorithm is more
   efficient at finding the Pareto fronts than the current
   state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a simulation framework and engine created to
   address several concerns in the design of multiagent concepts of
   operation, focused on the construct of ``work.{''} This framework
   incorporates the capabilities of several approaches, including cognitive
   work analysis, system-level modeling, and agent-based simulation. The
   framework promotes consistent, systematic models of the collective work
   performed by any number of agents within a concept of operation. As a
   side benefit, the ability to simulate work models also provides a
   mechanism to validate that the description of a concept of operation
   provides a complete and accurate representation of the agents'
   collective activities and of the work environment they act upon. The
   framework defines several computational structures: ``actions
   ``describing work processes, ``resources ``describing the state of the
   environment, ``decision actions{''} for strategy selection, and
   ``functions{''} allowing compositional modeling at multiple levels of
   abstractions. Timing constructs ensure correct temporal semantics, even
   with a wide variety of computational models, including discrete event
   forms and integration of continuous dynamics. Actions can be allocated
   during run time to agents that then execute them. Representative results
   from a study of function allocation between a flight crew and an
   autoflight system illustrate the insight provided by these models and
   their simulation.}},

Abstract = {{As detailed in the companion paper (Pritchett, A. R., Feigh, K. M., Kim,

   Information Systems (to be published)), simulation frameworks such as ``
   work models that compute{''} predict the complex, heterogeneous dynamics
   of concepts of operation that include physical components, humans, and
   automated agents. Work is modeled as a separate construct, and agent
   models are called during run time to execute actions from the work model
   when they are required. Thus, this paper applies the thought experiment
   in the form of the following question: What capabilities can be built
   into a generic agent model that has no internal knowledge of the task or
   actions to perform? These agent models are ``generic{''} in that they
   can be called at run time to operate on any work model. One capability
   in these generic agent models is task management, including prioritizing
   some actions such that others are interrupted, delayed, and perhaps
   ultimately forgotten. Further capabilities include anticipation of
   upcoming actions and maintaining an internal representation of those
   aspects of the work environment that they act upon. In addition, this
   paper discusses how a work model may provide several strategies from

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are widely used to document
   the on- and off-site trajectories of construction equipment. Before
   analyzing the collected data for better understanding and improving
   construction operations, the data need to be freed from outliers.
   Eliminating outliers is challenging. While manually identifying outliers
   is a time-consuming and error-prone process, automatic filtering is
   exposed to false positives errors, which can lead to eliminating
   accurate trajectory segments. This paper addresses this issue by
   proposing a hybrid filtering method, which integrates experts'
   decisions. The decisions are operationalized as parameters to search for
   next outliers and are based on visualization of sensor readings and the
   human-generated notes that describe specifics of the construction
   project A specialized open-source software prototype was developed and
   applied by the authors to illustrate the proposed approach. The software
   was utilized to filter outliers in sensor readings collected during
   earthmoving and asphalt paving projects that involved five different
   types of common construction equipment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Results of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of flow, transport
   processes and pathogen inactivation in contact tanks are presented. The
   three-dimensional numerical simulations are first validated using data
   from a previously completed laboratory experiment and velocity and
   conservative tracer transport data are available for comparison. The
   good agreement between CFD and experimental data confirms that the model
   reproduces accurately hydrodynamics and tracer transport processes. The
   analysis of the results reveals that the flow in the tank features
   extensive three-dimensionality, which is attributed to the current inlet
   configuration. Pathogen inactivation simulations show that complex flow
   in the tank affects the disinfection performance negatively. The
   potential for tank optimisation is examined by way of additional
   simulations featuring varying inlet designs, where it is shown that
   optimisation of inlet condition enhances the performance of the tank in
   terms of pathogen inactivation level for the same disinfectant dosage or
   the possibility of disinfectant dosage reduction towards reduced
   disinfection by product production.}},

Abstract = {{Early detection of malignant lesions could improve both survival and
   quality of life of cancer patients. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has
   emerged as a powerful tool for noninvasive cancer detection and
   diagnosis, with the advantage of avoiding tissue biopsy and providing
   diagnostic signatures without the need of a contrast agent in real time.
   We developed a spectral-spatial classification method to distinguish
   cancer from normal tissue on hyperspectral images. We acquire
   hyperspectral reflectance images from 450 to 900 nm with a 2-nm
   increment from tumor-bearing mice. In our animal experiments, the HSI
   and classification method achieved a sensitivity of 93.7\% and a
   specificity of 91.3\%. The preliminary study demonstrated that HSI has
   the potential to be applied in vivo for noninvasive detection of tumors.

Abstract = {{One of the most critical challenges to full integration of unmanned
   aircraft systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) is the
   requirement to comply with CFR 14 Part 91.113 to ``see and avoid{''}
   other aircraft. Various attempts have been made to develop systems to
   ``sense and avoid{''} other aircraft so UAS can comply with the intent
   of the regulation. This article proposes a framework to develop
   effectiveness requirements for any SAA system by linking UAS
   characteristics and operating environments to midair collision risk
   quantified by a fatality rate. The framework consists of a target level
   of safety (TLS) approach using an event tree format. Safety has been
   identified as the most important consideration in the UAS integration
   process. While safety can be defined in many ways, the authors propose
   using a fatality rate metric that follows other statistics used in the
   industry. This metric allows for the use of a TLS approach to the
   development of SAA requirements for system certification. Failure to
   adequately link system requirements to safety could result in the
   implementation of SAA systems that either do not adequately mitigate the
   risk associated with UAS operations or are overdesigned, resulting in
   increased cost and complexity. This article demonstrates the use of the
   proposed framework to develop specific SAA effectiveness standards based
   on UAS weight and airspace class combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) disrupts motor control
   and limits the ability to coordinate muscles for overground walking.
   Inappropriate muscle activity has been proposed as a source of
   clinically observed walking deficits after iSCI. We hypothesized that
   persons with iSCI exhibit lower locomotor complexity compared to
   able-body (AB) controls as reflected by fewer motor modules, as well as,
   altered module composition and activation.
   Methods: Eight persons with iSCI and eight age-matched AB controls
   walked overground at prescribed cadences. Electromyograms of fourteen
   single leg muscles were recorded. Non-negative matrix factorization was
   used to identify the composition and activation of motor modules, which
   represent groups of consistently co-activated muscles that accounted for
   90\% of variability in muscle activity.
   Results: Motor module number, composition, and activation were
   significantly altered in persons with iSCI as compared to AB controls
   during overground walking at self-selected cadences. However, there was
   no significant difference in module number between persons with iSCI and
   AB controls when cadence and assistive device were matched.
   Conclusions: Muscle coordination during overground walking is impaired
   after chronic iSCI.
   Significance: Our results are indicative of neuromuscular constraints on
   muscle coordination after iSCI. Altered muscle coordination contributes
   to person-specific gait deficits during overground walking. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The heavy tailed (HT) traffic from wireless users, caused by the
   emerging Internet and multimedia applications, introduces a HT
   interference region within which network users will experience unbounded
   delay with infinite mean and/or variance. Specifically, it is proven
   that, if the network traffic of primary networks (e. g., cellular and
   Wi-Fi networks) is heavy tail distributed, there always exists a
   critical density lambda(p) such that, if the density of primary users is
   larger than lambda(p), the secondary network users (e. g., sensor
   devices and cognitive radio users) can experience unbounded end-to-end
   delay with infinite variance even though there exists feasible routing
   paths along the network users. To counter this problem, the mobility of
   network users is utilized to achieve delay-bounded connectivity, which
   simultaneously ensures the existence of routing paths and the finiteness
   of the delay variance along these paths. In particular, it is shown that
   there exists a critical threshold on the maximum radius that the
   secondary user can reach, above which delay-bounded connectivity is
   achievable in the secondary networks. In this case, the end-to-end
   latency of secondary users is shown to be asymptotically linear in the
   Euclidean distance between the transmitter and receiver.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present the simulation results of phonon properties,
   including phonon dispersion relations, group velocities, phonon
   relaxation time and mode-specific thermal conductivity, of
   low-dimensional crystals using the newly developed concurrent
   atomistic-continuum (CAC) method. With significantly less number of
   degrees of freedoms than all-atom molecular dynamics, the CAC method
   predicts the phonon properties of one-dimensional (1D) polyatomic
   crystals at finite temperatures with the full anharmonicity of the
   atomic interactions being incorporated. Complete phonon branches of
   polyatomic crystals are obtained by CAC through the phonon spectral
   energy density analysis. It is shown that CAC allows medium to
   long-wavelength phonon transport from atomic to coarsely meshed finite
   element region without the need of special numerical treatment. The
   frequency-dependent phonon group velocities are explicitly measured in
   the simulation. Sub-THz phonon lifetimes in 100 -mm-long polyatomic
   chains containing 400 million of atoms are predicted. Analysis of the
   phonon mode-specific thermal conductivity shows that the medium to
   long-wavelength acoustic phonons are contributing to the majority of the
   heat transport in 1D crystal, suggesting that the long-wavelength
   phonons effectively act as thermal carriers in 1D system. This work
   provides a possible explanation for the anomalous heat transport
   observed in low-dimensional materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate spatial-frequency opportunistic
   transmission in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal

   uses a nullspace of the primary link to opportunistically transmit its
   own data without generating interference to the primary link. In a
   scenario where cooperation between primary and secondary links is
   allowed, we formulate a throughput maximization problem to determine the
   optimal nullspace that can be released by the primary link to maximize
   the throughput of the secondary link without violating its own
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Three nullspace releasing
   algorithms are proposed, called exhaustive-search (ESA),
   small-eigenvalue (SEA), and best-throughput (BTA) algorithms. From the
   numerical results, the BTA has lower computational complexity than the
   ESA and provides higher throughput than the SEA, thus offering a good
   compromise between implementation complexity and achievable throughput.}},

Abstract = {{A wideband (8-18 GHz) built-in test receiver in silicon-germanium
   technology is presented. The receiver chain consists of a low-noise
   amplifier (LNA), an image-reject mixer, on-chip automatic gain control
   ring oscillator sources that are used to provide test signals of a
   predefined amplitude, and control circuitry in the form of
   digital-to-analog converters and data registers. Both the LNA and the
   mixer circuit blocks incorporate tuning knobs to enable tuning of RF
   metrics to ensure consistent performance and mitigate the negative
   effects of process, voltage, and temperature variations, aging, and
   damage from extreme environments such as ionizing radiation. A maximum
   post-healed gain greater than 30 dB, an image rejection ratio exceeding
   30 dB, output third-order intercept point greater than 8 dBm, and noise
   figure less than 9 dB are obtained in measurement. An automated healing
   algorithm was developed and shown to be effective at improving the
   overall performance of the receiver. The receiver was fabricated in an
   0.18-mu m SiGe BiCMOS process with a peak f(T) of 150 GHz, and consumes
   240-260 mA from a 4-V supply.}},

Abstract = {{The authors report the synthesis of ZnO nanorods on flexible and
   transparent mica substrates. The coupled use of polyethylenimine and
   ammonium hydroxide provided a direct method for growing vertically
   well-aligned ZnO nanorods with a high aspect ratio. Using mica as a
   substrate material enabled thermal annealing processes, which improved
   the structural and optical properties of ZnO nanorods with uniform
   surface coverage and excellent adhesion, increased transmittance of
   indium tin oxide (ITO)/mica (52\%), and decreased sheet resistance of
   ITO/mica (80\%). We have fabricated ZnO nanorod-based dye-sensitized
   solar cells (DSSCs) and piezoelectric nanogenerators (NGs) and
   investigated their annealing effects on the device performances.
   Specifically, the thermal treatment at 500 degrees C for 30 min
   increased the energy conversion efficiencies of DSSCs by 53\%.
   Furthermore, we observed a three-fold increase in the NG's output
   voltage and output current density through this thermal annealing
   process. As shown below, mica, which can function under extremes of
   temperature, is useful as a substrate for flexible and transparent
   electronics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{121-127}},

Abstract = {{Effectively harvesting ambient energy is a key approach for realizing
   self-powered systems for portable electronics, wireless sensing,
   implanted devices, security and so on. It is generally desired that
   adding a power harvester should not add much weight, volume or
   additional components to the electronics. In this work, a
   cover-sheet-based (CS) triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is developed
   based on the protection structure of an electronics, such as a smart
   phone, for generating power for mobile electronics through conversion of
   mechanical energy. It consists of a slider and two stators. Each stator
   comprises of two complementary micrograting electrodes. At a sliding
   velocity 1 m s(-1), the CS-TENG produces an output current of 88.8 mu A,
   and a voltage of 2372 V. As a thin cover for mobile electronics, under
   the hand motions, the CS-TENG can light up household light bulbs or
   directly driving a mobile temperature meter without the use of a
   battery. In addition, springs are added to make the CS-TENG suitable for
   scavenging vibration energy from body motion. This study immediately
   opens the applications of TENG for conventional sensor systems. (C) 2014

Title = {{Hybrid triboelectric nanogenerator for harvesting water wave energy and
   as a self-powered distress signal emitter}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a hybrid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been
   developed for simultaneously harvesting the electrostatic energy and
   mechanical impact energy from water wave. It is comprised of two parts:
   an interfacial electrification enabled TENG (IE-TENG) and an
   impact-TENG. The IE-TENG, composed of a fluorinated ethylene propylene
   thin film and an array of electrodes underneath, is used to harvest
   electrostatic energy arising from the water-solid interface. The
   impact-TENG, constructed with nanostructured polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE) thin films and elastic wavy electrodes, is used to scavenge the
   mechanical impact energy from water wave. Under water waves propagating
   at a speed of 0.5 m/s, the short-circuit current of the IE-TENG and
   impact-TENG can reach 5.1 mu A and 4.3 mu A, respectively, which is able
   to drive nearly 50 LEDs simultaneously. Considering that natural water
   bodies may contain minerals and salt, the influence of NaCl
   concentration on the electric output of device has been investigated.
   Moreover, the hybrid TENG was developed as a self-powered distress
   signals emitter that may be used for life saving in water landing or
   swimming in evening. Considering the scalability of this technology,
   this work demonstrates the great potential of TENG in areas of
   hydropower harvesting, environmental monitoring and maritime search and
   rescue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon-based solar cell is by far the most established solar cell
   technology. The surface of a Si solar cell is usually covered by a layer
   of transparent material to protect the device from environmental
   damages/corrosions. Here, we replaced this protection layer by a
   transparent triboelectric nanogeneartor (TENG), for simultaneously or
   individually harvesting solar and raindrop energy when either or both of
   them are available in our living environment. The TENG is made of a
   specially processed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film, an indium tin
   oxide (ITO) and a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layer. Under solar
   light irradiation (12 W/m(2)) in a rainy day, the fabricated
   high-efficiency solar cell provides an open-circuit (V) of 0.43 V and
   short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of 4.2 A/m(2). And the TENG
   designed for collection of raindrop energy gives an AC V-OC of 30 V and
   (J(SC)) of 4.2 mA/m(2) when impacted by water drops at a dripping rate
   of 0.116 ml/s. In rainy days, the performance of solar cell decreased
   greatly, while TENG can be a good compensation as for green energy
   harvesting. From these results, we can see that the hybrid cell formed
   by a solar cell and a water-drop TENG have great potential for
   simultaneously/individually harvesting both solar energy and raindrop
   electrostatic energy under different weather conditions, especially in
   raining season. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We report self-powered velocity and trajectory tracking sensor (VTTS)
   array for detecting object motion, velocity, acceleration and trajectory
   based on single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator. The VTTS was
   fabricated by a cost-effective and simple-designed grid, which obtained
   the electric signals by the charge transition between the electrodes and
   the ground according to the electrostatic induction of objects. A
   self-powered VTTS arrays (9 x 9 pixels) with low-node mode was prepared
   and realized the real-time tracking of position, velocity, acceleration
   and trajectory for a moving object by visual observation. Using the
   simply electrode weave technique, a high-resolution VTTS with 41 x 41
   pixels on an active size of 1 x 1 cm(2) was obtained and it only needs
   the 41+41=82 output ports. The device can detect a tiny displacement and
   trajectory for the high resolution of 250 pi. This work may provide a
   innovate design for preparing VTTS with ultrahigh pixels and low-cost.

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a combined theoretical and numerical analysis is
   performed to study the internal and external flowfields of a liquid
   swirl injector. The effect of ambient pressure on the injector dynamics
   is explored systematically over a range of 150 atm. An increase in the
   ambient pressure increases the liquid film thickness, but decreases the
   spreading angle. This phenomenon can be attributed to the modification
   of the velocity profiles within the liquid film near the gas-liquid
   interface due to the alteration of the gas-phase shear stresses with
   pressure. The friction force at the interface plays a minor role. The
   generation and existence of stationary waves in the injector nozzle is
   also considered. At a higher ambient pressure, the pressure drop across
   the liquid sheet downstream of the injector exit increases, thereby
   suppressing the spreading of the liquid sheet. This in turn increases
   the thickness of the liquid sheet, and subsequently increases the
   breakup length at higher pressure. A semi-empirical model is developed
   to relate the velocity and pressure distributions near the surface of
   the liquid sheet. Good agreement is achieved between the measured and
   predicted shape and spreading angle of the liquid sheet. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a polymer
   electrolyte fuel cell requires the use of a catalyst based on Pt, one of
   the most expensive metals on the earth. A number of strategies,
   including optimization of shape or facet, formation of alloys with other
   metals, and incorporation of a different metal into the core, have been
   investigated to enhance the activity of a Pt-based catalyst and thus
   reduce the loading of Pt. This article reports the synthesis and
   characterization of Pd@Pt-Ni core-shell octahedra with high activity
   toward ORR. The octahedra with an edge length of 8 nm were obtained by
   directly depositing thin, conformal shells of a Pt-Ni alloy on Pd
   octahedra of 6 nm in edge length. The key to the success of this
   synthesis is the use of an amphiphilic solvent to ensure good
   compatibility between the solvents typically used for the syntheses of
   Pd and Pt-Ni nanocrystals. The core-shell structure was confirmed by a
   number of techniques, including scanning transmission electron
   microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping, in situ X-ray
   diffraction under H2 and He, and electrochemical measurements. Relative
   to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst, the Pd@Pt-Ni/C catalyst showed
   mass and specific ORR activities enhanced by 12.5- and 14-fold,
   respectively. The formation of a core-shell structure helped increase
   the electroactive surface area in terms of Pt and thus the mass
   activity. During an accelerated durability test, the mass activity of
   the Pd@Pt-Ni/C catalyst only dropped by 1.7\% after 10?000 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{In the past years, scientists have shown that development of a power
   suit is no longer a dream by integrating the piezoelectric nanogenerator
   (PENG) or triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with commercial carbon
   fiber cloth. However, there is still no design applying those two kinds
   of NG together to collect the mechanical energy more efficiently. In
   this paper, we demonstrate a fiber-based hybrid nanogenerator (FBHNG)
   composed of TENG and PENG to collect the mechanical energy in the
   environment. The FBHNG is three-dimensional and can harvest the energy
   from all directions. The TENG is positioned in the core and covered with
   PENG as a coaxial core/shell structure. The PENG design here not only
   enhances the collection efficiency of mechanical energy by a single
   carbon fiber but also generates electric output when the TENG is not
   working. We also show the potential that the FBHNG can be weaved into a
   smart cloth to harvest the mechanical energy from human motions and act
   as a self-powered strain sensor. The instantaneous output power density
   of TENG and PENG can achieve 42.6 and 10.2 mW/m(2), respectively. And
   the rectified output of FBHNG has been applied to charge the commercial
   capacitor and drive light-emitting diodes, which are also designed as a
   self-powered alert system.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in arterial regions exposed to
   disturbed flow, in part, due to alterations in gene expression.
   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding genes that
   post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by targeting messenger
   RNA transcripts. Emerging evidence indicates that alteration of flow
   conditions regulate expression of miRNAs in endothelial cells both in
   vitro and in vivo. These flow-sensitive miRNAs, known as mechano-miRs,
   regulate endothelial gene expression and can regulate endothelial
   dysfunction and atherosclerosis. MiRNAs such as, miR-10a, miR-9a,
   miR-23b, miR-17-92, miR-21, miR-663, miR-92a, miR-143/145, miR-101,
   miR-126, miR-712, miR-205, and miR-155, have been identified as
   mechano-miRs. Many of these miRNAs were initially identified as flow
   sensitive in vitro and were later found to play a critical role in
   endothelial function and atherosclerosis in vivo through either
   gain-of-function or loss-of-function approaches. The key signaling
   pathways that are targeted by these mechano-miRs include the endothelial
   cell cycle, inflammation, apoptosis, and nitric oxide signaling.
   Furthermore, we have recently shown that the miR-712/205 family, which
   is upregulated by disturbed flow, contributes to endothelial
   inflammation and vascular hyperpermeability by targeting tissue
   inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, which regulates metalloproteinases and
   a disintegrin and metalloproteinases. The mechano-miRs that are
   implicated in atherosclerosis are termed as mechanosensitive athero-miRs
   and are potential therapeutic targets to prevent or treat
   atherosclerosis. This review summarizes the current knowledge of
   mechanosensitive athero-miRs and their role in vascular biology and
   atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{In the search for improved coverage and capacity, cellular networks are
   currently undergoing a major transformation. A thoroughly planned
   architecture comprised of macrocells served by large-coverage expensive
   base stations (BSs) is evolving toward a muchmore heterogeneous
   architecture where the macrocell network is underlaid by one or several
   tiers of small cells deployed in an irregular and unplanned fashion
   using universal frequency reuse. Major challenges of this new scenario
   are the problems of intercell interference (ICI) and cell association.
   In this paper, these two problems are tackled in a novel way by
   analyzing and exploiting the inherent spatial cross-tier coverage
   correlation due to the cochannel ICI for a two-tier network. A
   mathematical framework for the representation of the two-tier coverage
   maps and their correlation is developed based on the spatial statistical
   properties of the signal quality measurements reported by the users to
   the base station. Several semivariogram-based estimation models are
   applied and cross-validated. Furthermore, a closed-form expression for
   the cross-tier coverage correlation function depending only on the
   estimator's parameters is obtained. In addition, a practical application
   of this framework is proposed. Cross-tier correlation information is
   exploited in the design of a new cell association policy based on
   cell-specific biasing for small cells. Numerical results show that the
   mathematical framework can provide accurate representations of the
   coverage fields and their correlation. Moreover, the performance of our
   proposed correlation-aware cell association policy is shown to be
   promising enough to encourage further research in this direction.}},

   cell adhesion}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical stimuli profoundly alter cell fate, yet the mechanisms
   underlying mechanotransduction remain obscure because of a lack of
   methods for molecular force imaging. Here to address this need, we
   develop a new class of molecular tension probes that function as a
   switch to generate a 20- to 30-fold increase in fluorescence upon
   experiencing a threshold piconewton force. The probes employ immobilized
   DNA hairpins with tunable force response thresholds, ligands and
   fluorescence reporters. Quantitative imaging reveals that integrin
   tension is highly dynamic and increases with an increasing integrin
   density during adhesion formation. Mixtures of fluorophore-encoded
   probes show integrin mechanical preference for cyclized RGD over linear
   RGD peptides. Multiplexed probes with variable guanine-cytosine content
   within their hairpins reveal integrin preference for the more stable
   probes at the leading tip of growing adhesions near the cell edge.
   DNA-based tension probes are among the most sensitive optical force
   reporters to date, overcoming the force and spatial resolution
   limitations of traction force microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The stress history profile in soils is evaluated on the basis of paired
   shear wave velocity measurements in different propagation directions
   (vertical and horizontal) with both waves horizontally polarised.
   Specifically, using a specially compiled database of sites with
   well-defined stress histories, the level of prestress, or
   overconsolidation difference (OCD = sigma'(p) - sigma'(vo)), relates
   directly to the ratio of shear moduli (G(0),(HH)/G(0,VH)) as measured by
   field geophysical testing. The G0, VH profile is obtained from standard
   downhole tests using a horizontal surface source and either a cased
   borehole or direct-push technology, such as seismic cone or seismic
   dilatometer, whereas the G(0,HH) profile is determined from a crosshole
   array using a torsional or rotary source at the same elevation as the
   geophones. In soil formations that are mechanically prestressed, the OCD
   is constant and permits the calculation of the profile of
   preconsolidation stress (sigma'(p)) with depth and corresponding
   overconsolidation ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-locked loops (PLLs) serve as core building blocks for
   communication systems and are often used to synthesize IO clocks for
   data synchronization and frequency sources for RF conversion. Testing of
   PLL loop performance is consequently important for guaranteeing the
   reliability of the underlying communication systems. In this paper, a
   low cost testing method based on loop triggering and use of built-in
   analog sensors (small number of transistors) to accurately predict
   phase-locked loop dynamic parameters is proposed. The sensor responses
   show strong statistical correlation with the PLL parameters being
   tested. Accordingly, supervised learning is applied to predict the
   required PLL parameters from the observed sensor response after
   ``training{''}. In order to verify analog sensor testing in PLL loop
   response evaluation, an off-the-shelf PLL and a PLL on printed circuit
   board (PCB) are tested using this method. The results are analyzed and
   shown with high correlation to loop parameters. Parameters including
   charge pump current, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) gain,
   bandwidth, phase margin, and locking time are predicted accurately to
   prove the viability of the proposed test method.}},

Abstract = {{Ozonation of oxalate in aqueous phase was performed with a commercial
   activated carbon (AC) in this work. The effect of AC dosage and solution
   pH on the contribution of hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) in bulk
   solution and oxidation on the AC surface to the removal of oxalate was
   studied. We found that the removal of oxalate was reduced by tert-butyl
   alcohol (tBA) with low dosages of AC, while it was hardly affected by
   tBA when the AC dosage was greater than 0.3 g/L. tBA also inhibited
   ozone decomposition when the AC dosage was no more than 0.05 g/L, but it
   did not work when the AC dosage was no less than 0.1 g/L. These
   observations indicate that HO center dot in bulk solution and oxidation
   on the AC surface both contribute to the removal of oxalate. HO center
   dot oxidation in bulk solution is significant when the dosage of AC is
   low, whereas surface oxidation is dominant when the dosage of AC is
   high. The oxalate removal decreased with increasing pH of the solution
   with an AC dosage of 0.5 g/L. The degradation of oxalate occurs mainly
   through surface oxidation in acid and neutral solution, but through HO
   center dot oxidation in basic bulk solution. A mechanism involving both
   HO center dot oxidation in bulk solution and surface oxidation was
   proposed for AC enhanced ozonation of oxalate. (C) 2014 The Research

Abstract = {{Lanthanide separation by simulated moving-bed chromatography was studied
   as a model system for separating lanthanide fission products and minor
   actinides from used nuclear fuels. The simulated moving-bed system was
   modeled for a tertiary pyridine anion-exchange resin supported on silica
   particles as the stationary phase and a mixture of methanol and 1M
   nitric acid as the mobile phase. Pulse injection tests using a single
   packed column were used to obtain chromatographic parameters for
   mathematical modeling of the simulated moving-bed system. Higher
   concentrations of methanol improved the separation, but the
   chromatograms showed evidence of nonlinearity of the isotherms. The
   mathematical model of the simulated moving-bed process predicted a
   production rate of purified samarium and neodymium at 118 g solute/L
   resin/day and a purity of 99.5\%. The optimal methanol ratio for the
   production rate for various product purities was determined from the
   model. The excellent separation of Nd and Sm suggests that the simulated
   moving-bed system could be applied to the separation of minor actinides
   such as americium and curium.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the bifurcations between dynamical states originating in
   the nonlinear dynamics of an external-cavity semiconductor laser at
   constant current can be detected by its terminal voltage V. We
   experimentally vary the intensity fed back into the gain medium by the

   optical intensity-based bifurcation diagram. It is shown using
   computational results based upon the Lang-Kobayashi model that whereas
   optical intensity accesses the dynamical-state variable vertical bar E
   vertical bar, V is related to population-inversion carrier density N.
   The change in feedback strength affects N and thereby the quasi-Fermi
   energy level difference at the p-i-n junction band-gap of the gain
   medium. The change in the quasi-Fermi energy-level thereby changes the
   terminal voltage V. Thus V is shown to provide information on the change
   in the dynamical-state variable N, which complements the more
   conventionally probed optical intensity. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Title = {{Exploring HVAC system sizing under uncertainty}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{243-252}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In current practice, HVAC systems are sized based on standardized
   procedures that were mostly developed by ASHRAE. The standard approach
   only implicitly deals with uncertainty in peak system demand through the
   selection of an appropriate design day and the choice of a safety
   factor. Although this method works satisfactorily in most cases, it
   offers no support to a system designer who wants to track the risk
   associated with an undersized system. The opposite, i.e. avoiding that
   the system is needlessly oversized deserves even more attention given
   the fact that current practice of ``defensive sizing{''} leads to
   oversized systems which leads to wasted capital investment and systems
   that operate far away from the optimum efficiency loads. This paper
   explores a new framework to guide the use of uncertainty analysis (UA)
   and sensitivity analysis (SA) in HVAC system sizing. UA will replace the
   safety factor with quantified margins based on comprehensive
   quantification of different sources of uncertainty. A
   probabilistic-based SA is then used to identify the important individual
   factors or groups of factors that contribute to uncertainty, providing
   means of risk management by applying better quality assurance methods or
   negotiating performance contracts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this modeling study, steam gasification of carbonaceous materials is
   examined in a hybrid solar/autothermal process designed to continuously
   produce synthesis gas. The process operates in three modes: (1) steam
   gasification where the necessary process heat to drive the chemical
   reaction is derived from concentrated solar irradiation, (2) autothermal
   steam gasification where pure oxygen is used to combust a portion of the
   carbonaceous feedstock for process heat, i.e., oxy-combustion, and (3) a
   combined mode during periods of low direct-normal solar irradiation
   where process heat is derived from a combination of solar irradiation
   and oxy-combustion. The resulting syngas can be continuously converted
   to liquid fuels via FischerTropsch or other catalytic processes.
   Equilibrium compositions for different reaction stoichiometric ratios of
   steam, O-2, and a carbonaceous material are examined over a 3001900 K
   temperature range using Gibbs free energy minimization. The process is
   then analyzed in a simplified finite-volume model using hourly
   direct-normal solar irradiation data, coupling chemical flows;
   conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer; and a dynamic
   feed-forward control system. Seasonal comparisons of the chemical solar
   energy storage from the solar gasification due to a calorific upgrade of
   the carbonaceous feedstock, process efficiency, and reduced
   anthropogenic CO2 emissions are discussed. Model cold gas (upgrade)
   ratios of 1.2 and solar-to-fuel efficiencies of 39\% were achieved
   during complete solar operation, while a cold gas efficiency of 87\% was
   maintained during autothermal operation. This indicates the successful
   storage of solar energy while producing a continuous stream of synthesis
   gas.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Extensive measurements of the centimeter-wavelength opacity of ammonia
   have been conducted under simulated deep jovian conditions using an
   ultra-high-pressure measurement system built at Georgia Tech. Over 1000
   measurements of the opacity of ammonia have been conducted in the 5-20
   cm wavelength range under simulated jovian conditions (pressures ranging
   from 0.05 to 99 bars, temperatures from 330 to 500 K) in a
   hydrogen-helium atmosphere. These and previous measurements conducted by
   Hanley et al. (Hanley et al. {[}2009]. Icarus, 202, 316-355) and Devaraj
   et al. (Devaraj et al. {[}2011]. Icarus, 212, 224-235) have been used to
   empirically derive a consistent ammonia opacity model for the 2 mm-20 cm
   wavelength range under the pressure and temperature conditions
   characteristic of the middle and deep jovian atmosphere. This model can
   be used reliably in the millimeter-wavelength range up to 3 bars of
   pressure and temperatures up to 300 K and in the centimeter-wavelength
   range up to 100 bars of pressure and temperatures up to 500 K. In
   addition, over 800 measurements of the 5-20 cm wavelength opacity of
   ammonia pressure-broadened by water vapor, hydrogen and helium have been
   conducted under simulated deep jovian conditions for the first time to
   study the influence of water vapor on the ammonia absorption spectrum.
   Based on these measurements, a new model has been developed. These
   laboratory data and the model show that water vapor has a measurable
   effect on the opacity of ammonia under jovian conditions. The laboratory
   study and the models will help to improve our understanding of
   centimeter-wavelength absorption by ammonia in the jovian planets in
   general, and specifically, will improve retrievals of ammonia and water
   vapor from the Juno microwave radiometer (MWR) at Jupiter. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Predictions of residual stress-induced deformations on thin aerospace
   parts are still among the most challenging and relevant problems in
   engineering applications. In this paper, a new methodology based on
   analytical modeling of machining mechanics is introduced in order to
   predict thin plate deflection induced by residual stresses given
   material attributes, process configurations, and parameters. The model
   uses an elasto-plastic constitutive behavior algorithm to predict the
   plastic stress, strain, and thus residual stresses. A relaxation
   procedure is applied upon residual stresses in order to quantify the
   elastic deflection when the plate is unloaded from cutting forces.
   Experimental validations are presented on multi-pass milling of
   aerospace grade aluminum alloy Al7050-T7451. The newly developed
   analytical model shows promise to predict the residual stresses and the
   thin plate deflection profile under various cutting conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores enrichment to the method of Multiple Scales, in
   some cases extending its applicability to periodic solutions of
   harmonically forced, strongly nonlinear systems. The enrichment follows
   from an introduced homotopy parameter in the system governing equation,
   which transitions it from linear to nonlinear behavior as the value
   varies from zero to one. This same parameter serves as a perturbation
   quantity in both the asymptotic expansion and the multiple time scales
   assumed solution form. Two prototypical nonlinear systems are explored.
   The first considered is a classical forced Duffing oscillator for which
   periodic solutions near primary resonance are analyzed, and their
   stability is assessed, as the strengths of the cubic term, the forcing,
   and a system scaling factor are increased. The second is a classical
   forced van der Pol oscillator for which quasiperiodic and subharmonic
   solutions are analyzed. For both systems, comparisons are made between
   solutions generated using (a) the enriched Multiple Scales approach, (b)
   the conventional Multiple Scales approach, and (c) numerical
   simulations. For the Duffing system, important qualitative and
   quantitative differences are noted between solutions predicted by the
   enriched and conventional Multiple Scales. For the van der Pol system,
   increased solution flexibility is noted with the enriched Multiple
   Scales approach, including the ability to seek subharmonic (and
   superharmonic) solutions not necessarily close to the linear natural
   frequency. In both nonlinear systems, comparisons to numerical
   simulations show strong agreement with results from the enriched
   technique, and for the Duffing case in particular, even when the system
   is strongly nonlinear.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerase-delta-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) interacts with NADPH
   oxidase 4 (Nox4) and regulates migration; however, the precise
   underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the role of
   Poldip2 in focal adhesion turnover, as well as traction force generation
   and polarization. Poldip2 overexpression (AdPoldip2) in vascular smooth
   muscle cells (VSMCs) impairs PDGF-induced migration and induces a
   characteristic phenotype of long cytoplasmic extensions. AdPoldip2 also
   prevents the decrease in spreading and increased aspect ratio observed
   in response to PDGF and slightly impairs cell contraction. Moreover,
   AdPoldip2 blocks focal adhesion dissolution and sustains H2O2 levels in
   focal adhesions, whereas Poldip2 knockdown (siPoldip2) significantly
   decreases the number of focal adhesions. RhoA activity is unchanged when
   focal adhesion dissolution is stimulated in control cells but increases
   in AdPoldip2-treated cells. Inhibition of RhoA blocks Poldip2-mediated
   attenuation of focal adhesion dissolution, and overexpression of RhoA or
   focal adhesion kinase (FAK) reverses the loss of focal adhesions induced
   by siPoldip2, indicating that RhoA and FAK mediate the effect of Poldip2
   on focal adhesions. Nox4 silencing prevents focal adhesion stabilization
   by AdPoldip2 and induces a phenotype similar to siPoldip2, suggesting a
   role for Nox4 in Poldip2-induced focal adhesion stability. As a
   consequence of impaired focal adhesion turnover, PDGF-treated AdPoldip2
   cells are unable to reduce and polarize traction forces, a necessary
   first step in migration. These results implicate Poldip2 in VSMC
   migration via regulation of focal adhesion turnover and traction force
   generation in a Nox4/RhoA/FAK-dependent manner.}},

Title = {{Intraoperative Near-Infrared Imaging Can Identify Pulmonary Nodules}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1223-1230}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background. Over 80,000 people undergo pulmonary resection for a lung
   nodule in the United States each year. Small nodules are frequently
   missed or difficult to find despite preoperative imaging. We
   hypothesized that near-infrared (NIR) imaging technology could be used
   to identify and locate lung nodules during surgery.
   Methods. We enrolled 18 patients who were diagnosed with a pulmonary
   nodule that required resection. All patients had a fine-cut 1-mm
   computed tomography scan preoperatively. The patients were given
   systemic 5 mg/kg indocyanine green and then underwent an open
   thoracotomy 24 hours later. The NIR imaging was used to identify the
   primary nodule and search for additional nodules that were not found by
   visual inspection or manual palpation of the ipsilateral lung.
   Results. Manual palpation and visual inspection identified all 18
   primary pulmonary nodules and no additional lesions. Intraoperative NIR
   imaging detected 16 out of the 18 primary nodules. The NIR imaging also
   identified 5 additional subcentimeter nodules; 3 metastatic
   adenocarcinomas and 2 metastatic sarcomas. This technology could
   identify nodules as small as 0.2 cm and as deep as 1.3 cm from the
   pleural surface. This approach discovered 3 nodules that were in
   different lobes than the primary tumor. Nodule fluorescence was
   independent of size, metabolic activity, histology, tumor grade and
   vascularity.
   Conclusions. This is the first-in-human demonstration of identifying
   pulmonary nodules during thoracic surgery with NIR imaging without a
   priori knowledge of their location or existence. The NIR imaging can
   detect pulmonary nodules during lung resections that are poorly
   visualized on computed tomography and difficult to discriminate on
   finger palpation. (C) 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Computational methods that characterize the thermodynamic properties of
   metal hydrides that operate at high temperatures, i.e., T > 800 K, are
   desirable for a variety of applications, including nuclear fuels and
   energy storage. Ternary hydrides tend to be less thermodynamically
   stable than the strongest binary hydride that forms from the metals. In
   this paper we use first-principles methods based on density functional
   theory, phonon calculations, and grand potential minimization to predict
   the isobaric phase diagram for 0 K <= T <= 2000 K for the ThZrH element
   space, which is of interest given that ThZr2Hx ternary hydrides have
   been reported with an enhanced stability relative to the binary
   hydrides. We compute free energies including vibrational contributions
   for Th, Zr, ThH2, Th4H15, ZrH2, ThZr2, ThZr2H6, and ThZr2H7. We develop
   a cluster analysis method that efficiently computes the configurational
   entropy for ThZr2H6 interstitial hydride and conclude that the
   configurational entropy is not a major driver for the enhanced stability
   of ThZr2H6 relative to the binary hydrides. Density functional theory
   (DFT) predicted thermodynamic stabilities for the hydride phases are in
   reasonable agreement with experimental values. ThZr2H6 is stabilized by
   finite temperature vibrational effects, and ThZr2H7 is not predicted to
   be stable at any studied temperature or pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we introduced an effective atom-pairwise partition of the
   many-body symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) interaction energy
   decomposition, producing a method known as atomic SAPT (A-SAPT)
   {[}Parrish, R. M.; Sherrill, C. D. J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 141, 04411.5].
   A-SAPT provides ab initio atom-pair potentials for force field
   development and also automatic visualizations of the spatial
   contributions of noncovalent interactions, but often has difficulty
   producing chemically useful partitions of the electrostatic energy, due
   to the buildup of oscillating partial charges on adjacent functional
   groups. In this work, we substitute chemical functional groups in place
   of atoms as the relevant local quasiparticles in the partition,
   resulting in a functional-group-pairwise partition denoted as
   functional-group SAPT (F-SAPT). F-SAPT assigns integral sets of local
   occupied electronic orbitals and protons to chemical functional groups
   and linking sigma bonds. Link-bond contributions can be further assigned
   to chemical functional groups to simplify the analysis. This approach
   yields a SAPT partition between pairs of functional groups with integral
   charge (usually neutral), preventing oscillations in the electrostatic
   partition. F-SAPT qualitatively matches chemical intuition and the
   cut-and-cap fragmentation technique but additionally yields the
   quantitative many-body SAPT interaction energy. The conceptual
   simplicity, chemical utility, and computational efficiency of F-SAPT is
   demonstrated in the context of phenol dimer, proflavine(+)-DNA
   intercalation, and a cucurbituril host guest inclusion complex.}},

Abstract = {{Microstencils have been utilized in biomedical engineering to pattern
   cell cultures, engineer tissues, and pattern conductive materials in
   microelectronics for the measurement of bioelectric activity. However,
   fabricating these microstencils can be considerably time consuming,
   expensive, and cleanroom processing or laser micromachining intensive.
   We present micro-fabrication strategies for producing stencils rapidly
   and cost effectively, with minimal use of cleanroom facilities, ideal
   for prototyping or applications where microfabrication costs need to be
   conserved. The process utilizes 3-D-printed templates as master
   structures from, which polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstencils are
   molded. The entire process, from concept to completed stencil, requires
   approximately one day; however, the majority of this time is budgeted
   for PDMS curing cycles, so it requires only similar to 1-2 person hours
   to complete. These microstencils were used to pattern metal traces
   similar to 160-1000-mu m wide, on three commonly used BioMEMS substrate
   materials-to pattern rat cortical neuronal cell cultures with radii
   between similar to 300 and 1000 mu m-and to pattern organic materials.
   With the advancement of 3-D-printing technologies, we anticipate that
   our presented processes will improve in resolution and gain a greater
   cost advantage over traditional microstencilling methods. {[}2014-0019]}},

   superalloy used as disk rotor material for gas turbine engines. Disk
   rotors manufactured from this superalloy are precipitation hardened to
   maintain high strength and fatigue resistance at temperatures greater
   than 60\% of the alloy melting temperature. SANS and electrical
   resistivity are both useful nondestructive techniques that are sensitive
   to the evolving precipitate phase, gamma', in the superalloy. SANS
   measurements were taken for both ex-situ and in-situ heat treatment of
   the superalloy at 998 K (725 degrees C). Electrical resistivity
   measurements were taken for samples given ex-situ heat treatment, and
   the data were compared to quantitative microstructural information
   obtained from in-situ SANS. The electrical resistivity was found to be
   especially sensitive to the precipitate volume fraction, showing inverse
   power-law dependence. Both SANS and electrical resistivity may be used
   in the future to monitor the progression in the strengthening
   precipitate phases in superalloys due to heat treatment or thermal
   exposure during service.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided waves, called lamb waves in plates, are a promising
   tool for in-situ monitoring of metallic structures. It is well known
   that varying environmental conditions such as temperature and loads
   significantly change guided wave signals and can thus obscure the
   detection of damage. However, applied tensile loads open cracks and can
   enhance their detectability. Previous research by the authors
   demonstrated a load-differential technique for detection and
   localization of fatigue cracks in simple structures that leveraged the
   effect of loading on crack opening. Here, load-enhanced concepts are
   combined with minimum variance imaging to characterize scatterers in
   structures with complex geometries. First, minimum variance images of
   cracks and benign scatterers were generated by incorporating assumed
   scattering patterns. Then, orientation curves were obtained by plotting
   the peak amplitude of preselected regions in the images as a function of
   the assumed orientation angle of the scatterers. The discrimination of
   cracks from several types of benign scatterers was accomplished by
   identifying characteristic patterns in the orientation curves. The
   efficacy of the proposed technique was demonstrated using data from
   fatigue tests performed on aluminum plate specimens with bonded
   doublers, multiple fastener holes and installed fasteners. It is shown
   that the load-enhanced techniques can discriminate cracks from drilled
   holes and fastener tightness variations, and that the approximate
   orientation of cracks can be estimated.}},

Title = {{Improving x-ray fluorescence signal for benchtop polychromatic cone-beam
   x-ray fluorescence computed tomography by incident x-ray spectrum
   optimization: A Monte Carlo study}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop an accurate and comprehensive Monte Carlo (MC) model
   of an experimental benchtop polychromatic cone-beam x-ray fluorescence
   computed tomography (XFCT) setup and apply this MC model to optimize
   incident x-ray spectrum for improving production/detection of x-ray
   fluorescence photons from gold nanoparticles (GNPs).
   Methods: A detailed MC model, based on an experimental XFCT system, was
   created using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code. The
   model was validated by comparing MC results including x-ray fluorescence
   (XRF) and scatter photon spectra with measured data obtained under
   identical conditions using 105 kVp cone-beam x-rays filtered by either 1
   mm of lead (Pb) or 0.9 mm of tin (Sn). After validation, the model was
   used to investigate the effects of additional filtration of the incident
   beam with Pb and Sn. Supplementary incident x-ray spectra, representing
   heavier filtration (Pb: 2 and 3 mm; Sn: 1, 2, and 3 mm) were
   computationally generated and used with the model to obtain XRF/scatter
   spectra. Quasimonochromatic incident x-ray spectra (81, 85, 90, 95, and
   100 keV with 10 keV full width at half maximum) were also investigated
   to determine the ideal energy for distinguishing gold XRF signal from
   the scatter background. Fluorescence signal-to-dose ratio (FSDR) and
   fluorescence-normalized scan time (FNST) were used as metrics to assess
   results.
   Results: Calculated XRF/scatter spectra for 1-mm Pb and 0.9-mm Sn
   filters matched (r >= 0.996) experimental measurements. Calculated
   spectra representing additional filtration for both filter materials
   showed that the spectral hardening improved the FSDR at the expense of
   requiring a much longer FNST. In general, using Sn instead of Pb, at a
   given filter thickness, allowed an increase of up to 20\% in FSDR, more
   prominent gold XRF peaks, and up to an order of magnitude decrease in
   FNST. Simulations using quasimonochromatic spectra suggested that
   increasing source x-ray energy, in the investigated range of 81-100 keV,
   increased the FSDR up to a factor of 20, compared to 1 mm Pb, and
   further facilitated separation of gold XRF peaks from the scatter
   background.
   Conclusions: A detailed MC model of an experimental benchtop XFCT system
   has been developed and validated. In exemplary calculations to
   illustrate the usefulness of this model, it was shown that potential use
   of quasimonochromatic spectra or judicious choice of filter
   material/thickness to tailor the spectrum of a polychromatic x-ray
   source can significantly improve the performance of benchtop XFCT, while
   considering trade-offs between FSDR and FNST. As demonstrated, the
   current MC model is a reliable and powerful computational tool that can
   greatly expedite the further development of a benchtop XFCT system for
   routine preclinical molecular imaging with GNPs and other metal probes.

Title = {{Design of an Yb-169 source optimized for gold nanoparticle-aided
   radiation therapy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To find an optimum design of a new high-dose rate ytterbium
   (Yb)-169 brachytherapy source that would maximize the dose enhancement
   during gold nanoparticle-aided radiation therapy (GNRT), while meeting
   practical constraints for manufacturing a clinically relevant
   brachytherapy source.
   Methods: Four different Yb-169 source designs were considered in this
   investigation. The first three source models had a single encapsulation
   made of one of the following materials: aluminum, titanium, and
   stainless steel. The last source model adopted a dual encapsulation
   design with an inner aluminum capsule surrounding the Yb-core and an
   outer titanium capsule. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Monte
   Carlo N-Particle code version 5 (MCNP5) were conducted initially to
   investigate the spectral changes caused by these four source designs and
   the associated variations in macroscopic dose enhancement across the
   tumor loaded with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) at 0.7\% by weight.
   Subsequent MC simulations were performed using the EGSnrc and NOREC
   codes to determine the secondary electron spectra and microscopic dose
   enhancement as a result of irradiating the GNP-loaded tumor with the
   MCNP-calculated source spectra.
   Results: Effects of the source filter design were apparent in the
   current MC results. The intensity-weighted average energy of the Yb-169
   source varied from 108.9 to 122.9 keV, as the source encapsulation
   material changed from aluminum to stainless steel. Accordingly, the
   macroscopic dose enhancement calculated at 1 cm away from the source
   changed from 51.0\% to 45.3\%. The sources encapsulated by titanium and
   aluminum/titanium combination showed similar levels of dose enhancement,
   49.3\% at 1 cm, and average energies of 113.0 and 112.3 keV,
   respectively. While the secondary electron spectra due to the
   investigated source designs appeared to look similar in general, some
   differences were noted especially in the low energy region (<50 keV) of
   the spectra suggesting the dependence of the photoelectron yield on the
   atomic number of source filter material, consistent with the macroscopic
   dose enhancement results. A similar trend was also shown in the
   so-called microscopic dose enhancement factor, for example, resulting in
   the maximum values of 138 and 119 for the titanium- and the stainless
   steel-encapsulated Yb-169 sources, respectively.
   Conclusions: The current results consistently show that the dose
   enhancement achievable from the Yb-169 source is closely related with
   the atomic number (Z) of source encapsulation material. While the
   observed range of improvement in the dose enhancement may be considered
   moderate after factoring all uncertainties in the MC results, the
   current study provides a reasonable support for the encapsulation of the
   Yb-core with lower-Z materials than stainless steel, for GNRT
   applications. Overall, the titanium capsule design can be favored over
   the aluminum or dual aluminum/titanium capsule designs, due to its
   superior structural integrity and improved safety during manufacturing
   and clinical use. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Understanding user choices and patterns regarding social network
   services (SNSs) is crucial for companies wanting to communicate with
   potential customers through this medium. This study suggests an
   empirical model that analyzes the effects of user characteristics, such
   as the main objectives, SNS and internet usage patterns, and
   socioeconomic background, on the choice of SNSs and their usage. We
   consider that a user may use multiple SNSs and estimate the consumer
   utility function with the multivariate probit model among four
   representative SNSs: Cyworld, Twitter, Facebook, and Me2day. The
   empirical analysis shows that user characteristics differ in terms of
   SNS and internet access times, devices generally used to access the
   SNS(s), main objectives of using the SNS(s), installation of SNS
   application(s) on smartphones, most frequently used portal site, and
   socioeconomic factors. We conclude that companies can utilize different
   SNSs as their communication channel with potential consumers, depending
   on their underlying purpose. For instance, companies that want to
   conduct target marketing may use Facebook, while those wanting to
   disseminate product-related information quickly are better off using
   Twitter. In addition, we find differences in the synergetic effect
   between portal services and SNSs for companies providing both services

Abstract = {{Over the last 2 years a global assessment of stem cell engineering (SCE)
   was conducted with the sponsorship of the National Science Foundation,
   the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The purpose was to
   gather information on the worldwide status and trends in SCE, that is,
   the involvement of engineers and engineering approaches in the stem cell
   field, both in basic research and in the translation of research into
   clinical applications and commercial products. The study was facilitated
   and managed by the World Technology Evaluation Center. The process
   involved site visits in both Asia and Europe, and it also included
   several different workshops. From this assessment, the panel concluded
   that there needs to be an increased role for engineers and the
   engineering approach. This will provide a foundation for the generation
   of new markets and future economic growth. To do this will require an
   increased investment in engineering, applied research, and
   commercialization as it relates to stem cell research and technology. It
   also will require programs that support interdisciplinary teams, new
   innovative mechanisms for academic-industry partnerships, and unique
   translational models. In addition, the global community would benefit
   from forming strategic partnerships between countries that can leverage
   existing and emerging strengths in different institutions. To implement

Abstract = {{We report on an excellent anode-supported H+-SOFC material system using
   a triple conducting (H+/O2-/e(-)) oxide (TCO) as a cathode material for
   H+-SOFCs. Generally, mixed ionic (O2-) and electronic conductors (MIECs)
   have been selected as the cathode material of H+-SOFCs. In an H+-SOFC
   system, however, MIEC cathodes limit the electrochemically active sites
   to the interface between the proton conducting electrolyte and the
   cathode. New approaches to the tailoring of cathode materials for
   H+-SOFCs should therefore be considered. TCOs can effectively extend the
   electrochemically active sites from the interface between the cathode
   and the electrolyte to the entire surface of the cathode. The
   electrochemical performance of NBSCF/BZCYYb/BZCYYb-NiO shows excellent
   long term stability for 500h at 1023K with high power density of
   1.61Wcm(-2).}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the vertical self-organized growth of thin-film SrTiO3
   (STO) nanotube arrays (NTAs) on SiO2 substrate. The surface morphology
   and crystal orientation of the grains at the exterior wall of the
   backbone TiO2 nanotube arrays were found to play an important role in
   the growth rate as well as the final morphology of the STO NTAs. A
   formation mechanism is proposed that involves nucleation of StTiO(3)
   nanocubes through a semitopochemical route followed by a self-assembly
   process resulting from the Ostwald-ripening-assisted oriented attachment
   of SrTiO3 nanocubes. It was shown that under appropriate reaction
   kinetics that nanotube architecture of the overall template can be
   maintained to form STO NTAs. The application of this novel platform
   enables a controlled and efficient mass fabrication of STO NTAs on
   widely used inexpensive silicon substrates, which can potentially lead
   to full integration with electronics in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{The comment by Nunes suggests a welcome refinement to an approximation
   made in the original paper. We show here that Nunes' refinement is
   identical to a modified effective thermal conductivity, k(eff) = k(1 +
   gamma ZT), where k is the thermal conductivity, ZT is the usual material
   figure of merit, and gamma is in the range 0.4-0.5. This form of k(eff)
   was already identified in Section 3.3 of our original paper as an option
   to improve the accuracy of the calculations and is itself an
   approximation to the more sophisticated k(eff) analysis of Baranowski,
   Snyder, and Toberer {[}J. Appl. Phys. 113, 204904 (2013)]. As noted by
   Nunes and ourselves, the main downside of such refinements is that they
   complicate the universality of the main result, the universal cost
   surface in Fig. 2 of the original paper. The simplified results in the
   original manuscript are justified and reasonable for ZT similar to 1 or
   less, for physical insight, scaling, and rapid screening. For the best
   accuracy in real systems, exact numerical solutions of the coupled cost
   and power equations are most appropriate, examples of which we have
   recently published for 30 bulk and thin film materials in Renewable
   Sustainable Energy Rev., 32, 313-327, 2014.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two methods used in 3-D IC placement that
   efficiently exploit the die-to-die thermal coupling in the stack. First,
   through-silicon vias (TSVs) are spread on each die to reduce the local
   power density and vertically aligned across dies simultaneously to
   increase thermal conductivity to the heatsink. Second, we move
   high-power logic cells to the location that has higher conductivity to
   the heatsink while moving TSVs in the upper dies so that high-power
   cells are vertically overlapping below the TSVs. These methods are
   employed in a force-directed 3-D placement successfully and outperform
   several state-of-the-art placers published in recent literature. We
   obtain 3-D placement results with shorter routed wirelength at similar
   temperature. We also obtain 3-D placement results with lower
   temperatures at similar routed wirelengths.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The small-strain shear modulus depends on stress in uncemented soils. In
   effect, the shear-wave velocity, which is often used to calculate shear
   stiffness, follows a power equation with the mean effective stress in
   the polarization plane V-s = alpha(sigma(m)'/1 kPa)(beta), where the
   alpha factor is the velocity at 1 kPa, and the beta exponent captures
   the velocity sensitivity to the state of stress. The small-strain shear
   stiffness, or velocity, is a constant-fabric measurement at a given
   state of stress. However, parameters alpha and beta are determined by
   fitting the power equation to velocity measurements conducted at
   different effective stress levels, so changes in both contact stiffness
   and soil fabric are inherently involved. Therefore, the alpha and beta
   parameters should be linked to soil compressibility CC. Compiled
   experimental results show that the a factor decreases and the b exponent
   increases as soil compressibility CC increases, and there is a robust
   inverse relationship between alpha and beta for all sediments: beta
   approximate to 0: 73-0: 27 log{[}alpha/(m/s)]. Velocity data for a
   jointed rock mass show similar trends, including a power-type
   stress-dependent velocity and inverse correlation between alpha and
   beta; however, the alpha-beta trend for jointed rocks plots above the
   trend for soils. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Fontan hemodynamics from 100 patient-specific cardiac magnetic resonance

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study sought to quantify average hemodynamic metrics of
   the Fontan connection as reference for future investigations, compare
   connection types (intra-atrial vs extracardiac), and identify functional
   correlates using computational fluid dynamics in a large
   patient-specific cohort. Fontan hemodynamics, particularly power losses,
   are hypothesized to vary considerably among patients with a single
   ventricle and adversely affect systemic hemodynamics and ventricular
   function if suboptimal.
   Methods: Fontan connection models were created from cardiac magnetic
   resonance scans for 100 patients. Phase velocity cardiac magnetic
   resonance in the aorta, vena cavae, and pulmonary arteries was used to
   prescribe patient-specific time-averaged flow boundary conditions for
   computational fluid dynamics with a customized, validated solver.
   Comparison with 4-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance velocity data
   from selected patients was used to provide additional verification of
   simulations. Indexed Fontan power loss, connection resistance, and
   hepatic flow distribution were quantified and correlated with systemic
   patient characteristics.
   Results: Indexed power loss varied by 2 orders of magnitude, whereas, on
   average, Fontan resistance was 15\% to 20\% of published values of
   pulmonary vascular resistance in single ventricles. A significant
   inverse relationship was observed between indexed power loss and both
   systemic venous flow and cardiac index. Comparison by connection type
   showed no differences between intra-atrial and extracardiac connections.
   Instead, the least efficient connections revealed adverse consequences
   from localized Fontan pathway stenosis.
   Conclusions: Fontan power loss varies from patient to patient, and
   elevated levels are correlated with lower systemic flow and cardiac
   index. Fontan connection type does not influence hemodynamic efficiency,
   but an undersized or stenosed Fontan pathway or pulmonary arteries can
   be highly dissipative.}},

Title = {{Mitral valve annuloplasty and anterior leaflet augmentation for
   functional ischemic mitral regurgitation: Quantitative comparison of
   coaptation and subvalvular tethering}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Although restrictive mitral annuloplasty (RMA) has been the
   preferred surgical treatment of functional ischemic mitral regurgitation
   (FIMR), some patients with severely dilated left ventricles will
   experience recurrent mitral regurgitation (MR). Consequently, new
   surgical strategies have been entertained to compensate for severely
   dilated ventricles by maximizing coaptation and reducing subvalvular
   tethering. Anterior leaflet augmentation (ALA) with mitral annuloplasty
   has been theorized to meet these goals. We compared the mechanistic
   effects of RMA and adjunct ALA in the setting of FIMR.
   Methods: Mitral valves were mounted in a clinically relevant left heart
   simulator. The tested conditions included control, FIMR, RMA, and
   true-size annuloplasty with either a small or large ALA. The A2-P2
   leaflet coaptation length, MR, and strut and intermediary chordal forces
   were quantified. All repairs alleviated the MR. The coaptation length
   was significantly increased from FIMR to RMA, small ALA, and large ALA
   (P < .001). Between repairs, a large ALA created the greatest length of
   coaptation (P < .05). Tethering forces from the posteromedial strut
   chordae were reduced from the FIMR condition by all repairs (P < .001).
   Only a large ALA reduced the intermediate chordal tethering from the
   FIMR condition (P < .05).
   Conclusions: A large ALA procedure created the greatest coaptation and
   reduced chordal tethering. Although all repairs abolished MR acutely,
   the repairs that create the greatest coaptation might conceivably
   produce a more robust and lasting repair in the chronic stage. A
   clinical need still exists to best identify which patients with altered
   mitral valve geometries would most benefit from an adjunct procedure or
   RMA alone.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate how the different processing methods
   cryopreservation and dehydration affect the structural integrity and
   biological composition of key signalling molecules within amniotic
   membrane and umbilical cord tissues.
   Method: We directly compared cryopreserved amniotic membrane (AM) and
   umbilical cord (UC) tissues with dehydrated amniotic membrane/chorion
   (dHACM) tissue using biochemical and functional assays including
   histological and histochemical staining, BCA,agarose gel
   electrophoresis, western blot, ELISA, and proliferation and cell death
   assays.
   Results: Cryopreservation retains the native architecture of the AM/UC
   extracellular matrix and maintains the quantity and activity of key
   biological signals present in fresh AM/UC, including high molecular
   weight hyaluronic acid, heavy chain-HA complex, and pentraxin 3. In
   contrast, dehydrated tissues were structurally compromised and almost
   completely lacked these crucial components.
   Conclusion: The results presented here indicate that cryopreservation
   better preserves the structural and biological signaling molecules of
   foetal tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular beacons (MBs) are dual-labeled oligonucleotides that fluoresce
   only in the presence of complementary mRNA. The use of MBs to target
   specific mRNAs allows sorting of specific cells from a mixed cell

   available surface markers or selectable metabolic characteristics, the
   MB-based method enables the isolation of a wide variety of cells. For
   example, the ability to purify specific cell types derived from
   pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is important for basic research and
   therapeutics. In addition to providing a general protocol for MB design,
   validation and nucleofection into cells, we describe how to isolate a
   specific cell population from differentiating PSCs. By using this
   protocol, we have successfully isolated cardiomyocytes differentiated
   from mouse or human PSCs (hPSCs) with similar to 97\% purity, as
   confirmed by electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. After designing
   MBs, their ordering and validation requires 2 weeks, and the isolation

Abstract = {{Most smart projectile control systems generate lateral control forces to
   guide the round to a target. Experience has shown that under the right
   combination of body orientation, translational velocity, and angular
   velocity, relatively low lateral control force inputs can induce
   instability of the round. To solve this problem, an additional control
   logic layer is appended to a nominal impact point flight control law to
   protect it from instability in these infrequent, but consequential
   situations. To highlight the newly developed control logic, a smart
   155mm spin-stabilized projectile equipped with a rotating paddle control
   mechanism is considered. For this example configuration, cross range
   maneuvering occasionally induces instability. Simulation results, using
   both rigid and multi-body nonlinear flight dynamics models, indicate
   that the addition of the instability protection layer in the control
   logic prevents projectile instability while not substantially altering
   target impact statistics. The nature of this protector design lends
   itself well to the use of a GPU to perform the calculations, greatly
   decreasing the computation time needed.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a real-time vision-based algorithm has been developed and
   implemented on a flying robot, in order to detect and identify a light
   beacon in the presence of excessive colored noise and interference.
   Starting from very basic and simple image analysis techniques including
   color histograms, filtering techniques, and color space analyses,
   typical pixel-based characteristics or a model of the light beacon has
   been progressively established. It has been found that not only are
   various color space-based characteristics significant, but also the
   relationships between various channels across different color spaces are
   of great consequence, in a beacon detection problem, specifically
   referring to a blue light-emitting diode. A block-based search algorithm
   comprising of multiple thresholds and linear confidence level
   calculation has been implemented to search established model
   characteristics in real-time video image data. During implementation,
   once excessive noise was encountered during flight tests, a simple and
   low cost noise and interference filter was developed. This filter very
   effectively handled all noise encountered in real time. The proposed
   work was successfully implemented and utilized on GeorgiaTech's
   participating aircraft for the International Aerial Robotics Competition
   by Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International for detection
   of a blue light-emitting diode problem. Major contributions of this work
   include establishing a multiple threshold search and detection algorithm
   based on not only various color channels but also their relationships
   and handling of as much as 40\% noisy or interfered video data with
   successful practical implementation and demonstration of proposed
   approach.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical strain as a trigger for pore formation in Schlemm's canal
   endothelial cells}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{224-235}},

Abstract = {{The bulk of aqueous humor passing through the conventional outflow
   pathway must cross the inner wall endothelium of Schlemm's canal (SC),
   likely through micron-sized transendothelial pores. SC pore density is
   reduced in glaucoma, possibly contributing to obstructed aqueous humor
   outflow and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Little is known about
   the mechanisms of pore formation; however, pores are often observed near
   dome-like cellular outpouchings known as giant vacuoles (GVs) where
   significant biomechanical strain acts on SC cells. We hypothesize that
   biomechanical strain triggers pore formation in SC cells. To test this
   hypothesis, primary human SC cells were isolated from three
   non-glaucomatous donors (aged 34, 44 and 68), and seeded on
   collagen-coated elastic membranes held within a membrane stretching
   device. Membranes were then exposed to 0\%, 10\% or 20\% equibiaxial
   strain, and the cells were aldehyde-fixed 5 min after the onset of
   strain. Each membrane contained 3-4 separate monolayers of SC cells as
   replicates (N = 34 total monolayers), and pores were assessed by
   scanning electron microscopy in 12 randomly selected regions (similar to
   65,000 mu m(2) per monolayer). Pores were identified and counted by four
   independent masked observers. Pore density increased with strain in all
   three cell lines (p < 0.010), increasing from 87 +/- 36 pores/mm(2) at
   0\% strain to 342 +/- 71 at 10\% strain; two of the three cell lines
   showed no additional increase in pore density beyond 10\% strain.
   Transcellular ``I-pores{''} and paracellular ``B-pores{''} both
   increased with strain (p < 0.038), however B-pores represented the
   majority (76\%) of pores. Pore diameter, in contrast, appeared
   unaffected by strain (p = 0.25), having a mean diameter of 0.40 mu m for
   I-pores (N = 79 pores) and 0.67 mu m for B-pores (N = 350 pores). Pore
   formation appears to be a mechanosensitive process that is triggered by
   biomechanical strain, suggesting that SC cells have the ability to
   modulate local pore density and filtration characteristics of the inner
   wall endothelium based on local biomechanical cues. The molecular
   mechanisms of pore formation and how they become altered in glaucoma may
   be studied in vitro using stretched SC cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Anemia, or low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, afflicts 2
   billion people worldwide. Currently, Hgb levels are typically measured
   from blood samples using hematology analyzers, which are housed in
   hospitals, clinics, or commercial laboratories and require skilled
   technicians to operate. A reliable, inexpensive point-of-care (POC) Hgb
   test would enable cost-effective anemia screening and chronically anemic
   patients to self-monitor their disease. We present a rapid, stand-alone,
   and disposable POC anemia test that, via a single drop of blood, outputs
   color-based visual results that correlate with Hgb levels.
   METHODS. We tested blood from 238 pediatric and adult patients with
   anemia of varying degrees and etiologies and compared hematology
   analyzer Hgb levels with POC Hgb levels, which were estimated via visual
   interpretation using a color scale and an optional smartphone app for
   automated analysis.
   RESULTS. POC Hgb levels correlated with hematology analyzer Hgb levels
   (r = 0.864 and r = 0.856 for visual interpretation and smartphone app,
   respectively), and both POC test methods yielded comparable sensitivity
   and specificity for detecting any anemia (n = 178) (<11 g/dl)
   (sensitivity: 90.2\% and 91.1\%, specificity: 83.7\% and 79.2\%,
   respectively) and severe anemia (n = 10) (<7 g/dl) (sensitivity: 90.0\%
   and 100\%, specificity: 94.6\% and 93.9\%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this POC
   color-based diagnostic test for self-screening/self-monitoring of
   anemia.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the design space of centimeter-scale micro wind
   turbines to power wireless sensors through an experimentally validated
   modeling and simulation environment. A stochastic optimizer is used to
   obtain a functional relationship between the minimum wind velocity
   required to find a feasible design and multiple constraints relevant to
   turbine designers, such as the maximum turbine radius, electrical power
   required, minimum voltage required and available generators. This
   relationship is created from an optimization formulation that uses
   knowledge from the underlying physics and previous optimizations. It is
   shown that the design space of micro wind turbines is significantly
   different than large wind turbines due to the low Reynolds number
   regime. Also, a strong coupling exists between the choice of generator
   and optimal wind turbine geometry to minimize the wind required to meet
   the requirements. Smaller generators are more appropriate for micro wind
   turbines only if a constraint is applied on the maximum radius of the
   turbine and if no minimum voltage is required for a fixed power output.}},

Abstract = {{A lotus leaf was used as a template to fabricate superhydrophobic
   biomorphic ZnO on a carbon substrate (ZnO/C). First, a carbon substrate
   with the microstructure of a leaf surface was obtained by sintering a

   immersing this carbon substrate into a Zn(NO3)(2) solution and
   sintering. Finally, the hydrophobicity of the surfaces of the products
   thus obtained was investigated. This ZnO/C material exhibited excellent
   superhydrophobicity and low adhesion after it was modified with fluorine
   silane. The water contact angle of the resulting product was 162
   degrees, which exceeds that of the lotus leaf (157 degrees) and is much
   higher than that of smooth carbon covered with the same fluorine silane
   (114 degrees). Moreover, this surface displayed a stable
   superhydrophobic performance even after exposure to ambient air for
   several months. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling tidal distortion in the Ogeechee Estuary}},
Journal = {{OCEAN MODELLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{60-69}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A 3D numerical model is used to simulate the distortion of tidal
   hydrodynamics in the Ogeechee Estuary, GA. The Ogeechee, like many
   estuaries found in the Southeastern US, consists of shallow channel
   networks and extensive intertidal storage in the form of wetlands. Such
   features are known to induce non-linear overtide generation and
   significant tidal distortion, otherwise known as tidal stage asymmetry.
   Simulations are run with varying parameters to assess their effects on
   modeling tidal distortion for the Ogeechee Estuary: bottom friction
   coefficients, enhanced wetland friction coefficients, and tidal flat
   elevations. To succinctly quantify the degree of distortion across the
   domain, the statistical parameters of skewness and asymmetry are
   calculated for time series of water surface heights and channel volume
   fluxes. The intertidal storage causes the peak flood flux to occur later
   and the peak ebb flux to occur earlier, thereby resulting in positive
   asymmetry for the volume flux for the full estuary. However, ebb
   dominance is a localized feature and varies throughout the estuary.
   Increasing the intertidal storage by lowering wetland elevation enhances
   the effects on high tide and volume flux magnitudes, decreasing the
   ebb-dominance and volume flux asymmetry typically associated with
   intertidal storage thereby indicating the importance of the wetland
   elevation over the total storage volume. Increased channel bottom
   friction reduces ebb-dominance by extending the duration of the falling
   tide. More interestingly, increased wetland friction reduces the
   influence of wetland intertidal storage on tidal distortion. The model
   suggests an increase in wetland friction does little to dampen wave
   propagation at high tide but rather impedes the lateral flooding of
   wetlands, reducing ebb dominance. Tidal flat elevation has the largest
   impact on distortion for the Ogeechee Estuary whereas enhanced wetland
   and bottom frictional influences on distortion are small, albeit not
   insignificant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report on ion-implanted, high-efficiency n-type silicon
   solar cells fabricated on large area pseudosquare Czochralski wafers.
   The sputtering of aluminum (Al) via physical vapor deposition (PVD) in
   combination with a laser-patterned dielectric stack was used on the rear
   side to produce front junction cells with an implanted boron emitter and
   a phosphorus back surface field. Front and back surface passivation was
   achieved by thin thermally grown oxide during the implant anneal. Both
   front and back oxides were capped with SiNx, followed by screen-printed
   metal grid formation on the front side. An ultraviolet laser was used to
   selectively ablate the SiO2/SiNx passivation stack on the back to form
   the pattern for metal-Si contact. The laser pulse energy had to be
   optimized to fully open the SiO2/SiNx passivation layers, without
   inducing appreciable damage or defects on the surface of the n(+) back

   for less than 3min after PVD Al provided an excellent charge collecting
   contact on the back. In order to obtain high fill factor of similar to
   80\%, an in situ plasma etching in an inert ambient prior to PVD was
   found to be essential for etching the native oxide formed in the rear
   vias during the front contact firing. Finally, through optimization of
   the size and pitch of the rear point contacts, an efficiency of 20.7\%
   was achieved for the large area n-type passivated emitter, rear totally

Abstract = {{A hydraulic pressure energy harvester (HPEH) device, which utilizes a
   housing in order to isolate a piezoelectric stack from the hydraulic
   fluid via a mechanical interface, generates power by converting the
   dynamic pressure within the system into electricity. Energy harvester
   prototypes were designed for generating low-power electricity from
   pressure ripples. These devices generate low-power electricity from
   off-resonance dynamic pressure excitation. The power produced per volume
   of piezoelectric material is analyzed to increase the power density;
   this is accomplished through evaluating piezoelectric stack
   characteristics, adding an inductor to the system circuit, and solving
   for optimal loading in order to achieve maximum power output. The
   prototype device utilizes a piezoelectric stack with high overall
   capacitance, which allows for inductance matching without using an
   active circuit. This work presents an electromechanical model and the
   experimental results of the HPEH devices using a parallel connection of
   inductive and resistive loads as the energy harvesting circuit. A
   non-ideal inductive load case is also considered and successfully
   modeled by accounting for the parasitic resistance of the inductive
   load. Various HPEH prototypes are fabricated, modeled, and compared in
   terms of their normalized power density levels, and milli-Watt level
   average power generation is demonstrated. The highest power density is
   reported for the single-crystal HPEH prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Autograft treatment of large bone defects and fracture non-unions is
   complicated by limited tissue availability and donor site morbidity.
   Polymeric biomaterials such as alginate hydrogels provide an attractive
   tissue engineering alternative due to their biocompatibility,
   injectability, and tunable degradation rates. Irradiated RGD-alginate
   hydrogels have been used to deliver proteins such as bone morphogenetic
   protein-2 (BMP-2), to promote bone regeneration and restoration of
   function in a critically sized rat femoral defect model. However, slow
   degradation of irradiated alginate hydrogels may impede integration and
   remodeling of the regenerated bone to its native architecture. Oxidation
   of alginate has been used to promote degradation of alginate matrices.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of alginate
   oxidation on BMP-2 release and bone regeneration. We hypothesized that
   oxidized-irradiated alginate hydrogels would elicit an accelerated
   release of BMP-2, but degrade faster in vivo, facilitating the formation
   of higher quality, more mature bone compared to irradiated alginate.
   Indeed, oxidation of irradiated alginate did accelerate in vitro BMP-2
   release. Notably, the BMP-2 retained within both constructs was
   bioactive at 26 days, as observed by induction of alkaline phosphatase
   activity and positive Alizarin Red S staining of MC3T3-E1 cells. From
   the in vivo study, robust bone regeneration was observed in both groups
   through 12 weeks by radiography, micro-computed tomography analyses, and
   biomechanical testing. Bone mineral density was significantly greater
   for the oxidized-irradiated alginate group at 8 weeks. Histological
   analyses of bone defects revealed enhanced degradation of
   oxidized-irradiated alginate and suggested the presence of more mature
   bone after 12 weeks of healing. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Title = {{Identifying the crystal graveyards remaining after large silicic

Abstract = {{The formation of crystal-poor high-silica rhyolite via extraction of
   interstitial melt from an upper crustal mush predicts the complementary
   formation of large amounts of (typically unerupted) silicic cumulates.
   However, identification of these cumulates remains controversial. One
   hindrance to our ability to identify them is a lack of clear predictions
   for complementary chemical signatures between extracted melts and their
   residues. To address this discrepancy, we present a generalized
   geochemical model tracking the evolution of trace elements in a magma
   reservoir concurrently experiencing crystallization and extraction of
   interstitial melt. Our method uses a numerical solution rather than
   analytical, thereby allowing for various dependencies between
   crystallinity, partition coefficients for variably compatible and/or
   incompatible elements, and melt extraction efficiency. Results reveal
   unambiguous fractionation signatures for the extracted melts, while
   those signatures are muted for their cumulate counterparts. Our model is
   first applied to a well-constrained example (Searchlight pluton, USA),
   and provides a good fit to geochemical data. We then extrapolate our
   results to understanding the relationship between volcanic and plutonic
   silicic suites on a global scale. Utilizing the NAVDAT database to
   identify crystal accumulation or depletion signatures for each suite, we
   suggest that many large granitoids are indeed silicic cumulates,
   although their crystal accumulation signature is expected to be subtle.

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications
   refers to the idea equipping cellular base stations (BSs) with a very
   large number of antennas, and has been shown to potentially allow for
   orders of magnitude improvement in spectral and energy efficiency using
   relatively simple (linear) processing. In this paper, we present a
   comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research on the topic, which
   has recently attracted considerable attention. We begin with an
   information theoretic analysis to illustrate the conjectured advantages
   of massive MIMO, and then we address implementation issues related to
   channel estimation, detection and precoding schemes. We particularly
   focus on the potential impact of pilot contamination caused by the use
   of non-orthogonal pilot sequences by users in adjacent cells. We also
   analyze the energy efficiency achieved by massive MIMO systems, and
   demonstrate how the degrees of freedom provided by massive MIMO systems
   enable efficient single-carrier transmission. Finally, the challenges
   and opportunities associated with implementing massive MIMO in future
   wireless communications systems are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an algorithm to detect cardiac quiescence within a heartbeat
   using nonlinear filtering and boundary detection techniques in
   echocardiography images. The motivation for detection of these quiescent
   phases is to provide improved cardiac gating to obtain
   motion-artifact-free images of the heart at cardiac computed tomography
   (CT). Currently, cardiac gating is provided through electrocardiography
   (ECG), which does not provide information about the instantaneous
   mechanical state of the heart. Our goal is to test if information about
   the actual mechanical motion of the heart obtained from B-mode
   echocardiographic data could potentially be used for gating purposes.
   The nonlinear filtering algorithm presented involves anisotropic
   diffusion to smoothen the homogeneous regions of the B-mode images while
   preserving image edges that represent myocardial boundaries. Following
   this, we detect the boundary of a particular region of interest (ROI)
   using a thresholding step. The positional changes of this ROI are then
   observed for quiescent phases over multiple cardiac cycles using the
   ECG's R-R interval. In a pilot study, seven subjects were imaged in the
   apical, four-chamber view, and quiescence of the interventricular septum
   was primarily observed in the diastolic region of the ECG signal.
   However, the position and length of quiescence vary across multiple
   heartbeats for the same individual and for different individuals as
   well. The center of quiescence for the seven patients ranged from 51 to
   84 \% and did not show a trend with heart rates, which ranged from 54 to
   83 beats per minute. The gating intervals based on such analysis of
   echocardiographic signals could potentially optimize cardiac CT gating.}},

Abstract = {{The instrumented tracking and telemetry ship with a ship-borne satellite
   antenna (SSA) is the critical device to ensure high quality of space
   exploration work. To effectively detect mechanical anomalies that can
   lead to unexpected downtime of the SSA, an ensemble multiwavelet (EM) is
   presented for identifying the anomaly related incipient-signatures
   within the measured dynamic signals. Rather than using a predetermined
   basis as in a conventional multiwavelet, an EM optimizes the matching
   basis which satisfactorily adapts to the anomaly related
   incipient-signatures. The construction technique of an EM is based on
   the conjunction of a two-scale similarity transform (TST) and lifting
   scheme (LS). For the technique above, the TST improves the regularity by
   increasing the approximation order of multiscaling functions, while
   subsequently the LS enhances the smoothness and localizability via
   utilizing the vanishing moment of multiwavelet functions. Moreover,
   combining the Hilbert transform with EM decomposition, we identify the
   incipient-signatures induced by the mechanical anomalies from the
   measured dynamic signals. A numerical simulation and two successful
   applications of diagnosis cases (a planetary gearbox and a roller
   bearing) demonstrate that the proposed technique is capable of dealing
   with the challenging incipient-signature identification task even though
   spectral complexity, as well as the strong amplitude/frequency
   modulation effect, is present in the dynamic signals.}},

Abstract = {{Marine phytoplankton blooms are annual spring events that sustain active
   and diverse bloom-associated bacterial populations. Blooms vary
   considerably in terms of eukaryotic species composition and
   environmental conditions, but a limited number of heterotrophic
   bacterial lineages-primarily members of the Flavobacteriia,
   Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria-dominate these communities.
   In this Review, we discuss the central role that these bacteria have in
   transforming phytoplankton-derived organic matter and thus in
   biogeochemical nutrient cycling. On the basis of selected field and
   laboratory-based studies of flavobacteria and roseobacters, distinct
   metabolic strategies are emerging for these archetypal
   phytoplankton-associated taxa, which provide insights into the
   underlying mechanisms that dictate their behaviours during blooms.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can help the realization of low-cost
   power grid automation systems where multi-functional sensor nodes can be
   used to monitor the critical parameters of smart grid components. The
   WSN-based smart grid applications include but not limited to load
   control, power system monitoring and control, fault diagnostics, power
   fraud detection, demand response, and distribution automation. However,
   the design and implementation of WSNs are constrained by energy
   resources. Sensor nodes have limited battery energy supply and
   accordingly, power aware communication protocols have been developed in
   order to address the energy consumption and prolong their lifetime. In
   this paper, the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes has been analyzed
   under different smart grid radio propagation environments, such as 500
   kV substation, main power control room, and underground network
   transformer vaults. In particular, the effects of smart grid channel
   characteristics and radio parameters, such as path loss, shadowing,
   frame length and distance, on a wireless sensor node lifetime have been
   evaluated. Overall, the main objective of this paper is to help network
   designers quantifying the impact of the smart grid propagation
   environment and sensor radio characteristics on node lifetime in harsh
   smart grid environments.}},

Journal = {{ACTA GEOTECHNICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{847-867}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A thermodynamic framework is proposed to couple the effect of mechanical
   stress and temperature on crack opening and closure in rocks. The model
   is based on continuum damage mechanics, with damage defined as the
   second-order crack density tensor. The free energy of the damaged rock
   is expressed as a function of deformation, temperature, and damage. The
   damage criterion captures mode I crack propagation, the reduction in
   toughness due to heating, and the increase in energy release rate with
   cumulated damage. Crack closure is modeled through unilateral effects
   produced on rock stiffness. The model was calibrated and verified
   against published experimental data. Thermo-mechanical crack opening
   (resp. closure) was studied by simulating a triaxial compression test
   (resp. uniaxial extension test), including a thermal loading phase. The
   degradation of stiffness due to tensile stress and recovery of stiffness
   induced by both mechanical and thermo-mechanical unilateral effects are
   well captured. The thermo-mechanical energy release rate increases with
   thermal dilation and also decreases with ambient temperature. It was
   observed that there is a temperature threshold, below which the rock
   behaves elastically. A parametric study also showed that the model can
   capture hardening and softening during thermo-mechanical closure (for
   specific sets of parameters). These numerical observations may guide the
   choice of rock material used in geotechnical design, especially for
   nuclear waste disposals or compressed-air storage facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are disinfectants widely used in a variety
   of clinical and environmental settings to prevent microbial infections,
   and they are frequently detected in nontarget environments, such as
   aquatic and engineered biological systems, even at toxic levels.
   Therefore, microbial degradation of BACs has important ramifications for
   alleviating disinfectant toxicity in nontarget environments as well as
   compromising disinfectant efficacy in target environments. However, how
   natural microbial communities respond to BAC exposure and what genes
   underlie BAC biodegradation remain elusive. Our previous metagenomic
   analysis of a river sediment microbial community revealed that BAC
   exposure selected for a low-diversity community, dominated by several
   members of the Pseudomonas genus that quickly degraded BACs. To
   elucidate the genetic determinants of BAC degradation, we conducted
   time-series metatranscriptomic analysis of this microbial community
   during a complete feeding cycle with BACs as the sole carbon and energy
   source under aerobic conditions. Metatranscriptomic profiles revealed a
   candidate gene for BAC dealkylation, the first step in BAC
   biodegradation that results in a product 500 times less toxic.
   Subsequent biochemical assays and isolate characterization verified that
   the putative amine oxidase gene product was functionally capable of
   initiating BAC degradation. Our analysis also revealed cooperative
   interactions among community members to alleviate BAC toxicity, such as
   the further degradation of BAC dealkylation by-products by organisms not
   encoding amine oxidase. Collectively, our results advance the
   understanding of BAC aerobic biodegradation and provide genetic
   biomarkers to assess the critical first step of this process in
   nontarget environments.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft automation designers are faced with the challenge to develop
   and improve automation such that it is transparent to the pilots using
   it. To identify problems that may arise between pilots and automation,
   methods are needed that can uncover potential problems with automation
   early in the design process. In this paper, simulation and model
   checking are combined and their respective advantages leveraged to find
   problematic human-automation interaction using methods that would be
   available early in the design process. A particular problem of interest
   is automation surprises, which describe events when pilots are surprised
   by the actions of the automation. The Tarom flight 381 incident
   involving the former Airbus automatic speed protection logic, leading to
   an automation surprise, is used as a common case study. Results of this
   case study indicate that both methods identified the automation surprise
   found in the Tarom flight 381 incident, and that the simulation
   identified additional automation surprises associated with that flight
   logic. The work shows that the methods can be symbiotically combined,
   and the joint method is suitable to identify problematic
   human-automation interaction such as automation surprise.}},

   nanoferrite showed the saturation magnetization reached 84.91emu/g when
   the x was 0.7 and the largest magnetic loss tangent at the frequency of
   2.45 GHz. Microwave absorbing properties of these composites were
   studied at the frequency range of 2-18 GHz. Two microwave reflection
   loss peaks appeared for all the spinel ferrite. When x was 0.5, the
   minimum reflection loss appeared at the highest frequency. When x was
   0.7, these two minimum reflection loss peaks, -17.36 and -48.13 dB, were
   calculated with the -10 dB bandwidth at the frequency ranges of

Abstract = {{The use of multicomponent scaffolds for cell implantation has
   necessitated sophisticated techniques for tracking of cell survival in
   vivo. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) has emerged as a noninvasive tool for
   evaluating the therapeutic potential of cell-based tissue engineering
   strategies. However, the ability to use BLI measurements to
   longitudinally assess large 3D cellular constructs in vivo and the
   effects of potential confounding factors are poorly understood. In this
   study, luciferase-expressing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were
   delivered subcutaneously within agarose and RGD-functionalized alginate
   hydrogel vehicles to investigate the impact of construct composition and
   tissue formation on BLI signal. Results showed that alginate constructs
   exhibited twofold greater BLI counts than agarose constructs at
   comparable hMSC doses. However, each hydrogel type produced a linear
   correlation between BLI counts and live cell number, indicating that
   within a given material, relative differences in cell number could be
   accurately assessed at early time points. The survival efficiency of
   delivered hMSCs was highest for the lower cell doses embedded within
   alginate matrix. BLI signal remained predictive of live cell number
   through 1 week in vivo, although the strength of correlation decreased
   over time. Irrespective of hydrogel type or initial hMSC seeding dose,
   all constructs demonstrated a degree of vascularization and development
   of a fibrotic capsule after 1 week. Formation of tissue within and
   adjacent to the constructs was accompanied by an attenuation of BLI
   signal during the initial period of the image acquisition time-frame. In
   alginate constructs only, greater vessel volume led to a delayed rise in
   BLI signal following luciferin delivery. This study identified vascular
   and fibrotic tissue ingrowth as potential confounding variables for
   longitudinal BLI studies. Further investigation into the complexities of
   noninvasive BLI data acquisition from multicomponent constructs,
   following implantation and subsequent tissue formation, is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Unique anatomic locations and physiologic functions predispose different
   arteries to varying mechanical responses and pathologies. However, the
   underlying causes of these mechanical differences are not well
   understood. The objective of this study was to first identify structural
   differences in the arterial matrix that would account for the mechanical
   differences between healthy femoral and carotid arteries and second to
   utilize these structural observations to perform a microstructurally
   motivated constitutive analysis. Femoral and carotid arteries were
   subjected to cylindrical biaxial loading and their microstructure was
   quantified using two-photon microscopy. The femoral arteries were found
   to be less compliant than the carotid arteries at physiologic loads,
   consistent with previous studies, despite similar extracellular
   compositions of collagen and elastin (). The femoral arteries exhibited
   significantly less circumferential dispersion of collagen fibers (),
   despite a similar mean fiber alignment direction as the carotid
   arteries. Elastin transmural distribution, in vivo axial stretch, and
   opening angles were also found to be distinctly different between the
   arteries. Lastly, we modeled the arteries' mechanical behaviors using a
   microstructural-based, distributed collagen fiber constitutive model.
   With this approach, the material parameters of the model were solved
   using the experimental microstructural observations. The findings of
   this study support an important role for microstructural organization in
   arterial stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel technique to permanently tune a frequency

   The stiffness changes are applied to the vicinity of the supporting post
   at the base of a hemispherical resonator, a region, which has not been
   previously studied for this purpose. Our numerical studies show the
   four-nodal point elliptical wineglass modes are highly sensitive to
   strain modifications around the post. The algorithm is developed and
   proven effective through finite element method simulations in COMSOL,

Abstract = {{Strategies for the transition of municipal sludge anaerobic digestion
   from mesophilic to thermophilic were assessed and the long-term
   stability and performance of thermophilic digesters operated at a solids
   retention time of 30 days were evaluated. Transition from 36 degrees C
   to 53.3 degrees C at a rate of 3 degrees C/day resulted in fluctuation
   of the daily gas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production.
   Steady-state was reached within 35 days from the onset of temperature
   increase. Transitions from either 36 or 53.3 degrees C to 60 degrees C
   resulted in relatively stable daily gas production, but VFAs remained at
   very high levels (in excess of 5000 mg COD/L) and methane production was
   lower than that of the mesophilic reactor. It was concluded that in
   order to achieve high VS and COD destruction and methane production, the
   temperature of continuous-flow, suspended growth digesters fed with
   mixed municipal sludge should be kept below 60 degrees C. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Imprecision, incompleteness and dynamic exist in a wide range of network
   applications. It is difficult to decide the uncertainty relationship
   among nodes since traditional models are not meaningful in uncertain

   uncertainty is always intractable. In this paper, we study how to
   capture uncertainty in networks by transforming a series of snapshots of
   a network to an uncertain graph. A novel sampling scheme is also
   proposed which enables the development of efficient algorithms to
   measure uncertainty in networks. Considering the practical aspects of
   neighborhood relationship in real networks, a framework is introduced to
   transform an uncertain network into a deterministic weighted network
   where the weights on edges can be measured by Jaccard-like index. The
   comprehensive experimental evaluation results on real data demonstrate
   the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Light activated polymers (LAPs) are a class of contemporary materials
   that when irradiated with light respond with mechanical deformation.
   Among the different molecular mechanisms of photoactuation, here we
   study radical induced bond exchange reactions (BERs) that alter
   macromolecular chains through an addition-fragmentation process where a
   free chain whose active end group attaches then breaks a network chain.
   Thus the BER yields a polymer with a covalently adaptable network. When
   a LAP sample is loaded, the macroscopic consequence of BERs is stress
   relaxation and plastic deformation. Furthermore, if light penetration
   through the sample is nonuniform, resulting in nonuniform stress
   relaxation, the sample will deform after unloading in order to achieve
   equilibrium. In the past, this light activation mechanism was modeled as
   a phase evolution process where chain addition-fragmentation process was
   considered as a phase transformation between stressed phases and
   newly-born phases that are undeformed and stress free at birth. Such a
   modeling scheme describes the underlying physics with reasonable
   fidelity but is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a
   new approach where the BER induced macromolecular network alteration is
   modeled as a viscoplastic deformation process, based on the observation
   that stress relaxation due to light irradiation is a time-dependent
   process similar to that in viscoelastic solids with an irrecoverable
   deformation after light irradiation. This modeling concept is further
   translated into a finite deformation photomechanical constitutive model.
   The theological representation of this model is a photoviscoplastic
   element placed in series with a standard linear solid model in
   viscoelasticity. A two-step iterative implicit scheme is developed for
   time integration of the two time-dependent elements. We carry out a
   series of experiments to determine material parameters in our model as
   well as to validate the performance of the model in complex geometrical
   and loading configurations. The comparison between the finite element
   simulations and experiments shows that the model can accurately capture
   the response of the LAP under a wide range of coupled photo-mechanical
   loading conditions, such as light induced stress relaxation, creep in
   tension, and bending. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of the
   model by simulating a series of examples that exhibit complex
   three-dimensional, time-dependent photodeformation, including
   photoorigami, photoforming, and photobulge tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   lithiation-induced phase transformation, morphological evolution, stress
   generation and fracture in crystalline silicon nanowires (c-SiNWs). The
   model couples lithium (Li) diffusion with elasto-plastic deformation in
   a three-dimensional (3D) setting. Several key features observed from
   recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies are incorporated
   into the model, including the sharp interface between the lithiated
   amorphous shell and unlithiated crystalline core, crystallographic
   orientation dependent Li-Si reaction rate, and large-strain plasticity.
   Our simulation results demonstrate that the model faithfully predicts
   the anisotropic swelling of lithiated SiNWs observed from previous
   experimental studies. Stress analysis from the finite-deformation model
   reveals that the SiNWs are prone to surface fracture at the angular
   sites where two adjacent \{110\} facets intersect, consistent with
   previous experimental observations. The mechanistic understanding of the
   morphological evolution and stress generation sheds light on the design
   of failure-resistant nanostructured electrodes. Our model offers a
   framework for the study of the chemo-mechanical degradation in
   high-capacity electrode materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A multilayered barrier structure was fabricated by chemical vapor
   deposition of parylene and subsequent plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition of SiOx or SiNx. The barrier performance against water vapor
   ingress was significantly improved by annealing the parylene layer
   before the deposition of either SiOx or SiNx. The mechanism of this
   enhancement was investigated using atomic force microscopy, Raman
   spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The surface roughness of the
   parylene before the deposition of either SiOx or SiNx was found to
   correlate closely with the barrier performance of the multilayered
   structures. In addition, removing absorbed water vapor in the film by
   annealing results in a lower water vapor transmission rate in the
   transient region and a longer lag time. Annealing the parylene leads to
   a large decrease in the effective water vapor transmission rate, which
   reaches 7.2 +/- 3.0 x 10(-6)g/m(2)/day. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Air-coupled detection of nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves in
   concrete-Application to microcracking detection}},
Journal = {{NDT \& E INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{64-70}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new technique for the application of the second
   harmonic generation (SHG) in Rayleigh surface waves to nondestructively
   quantify microstructural changes and microcracks in heterogeneous
   cement-based materials (mortar and concrete). The effect of shrinkage
   reducing admixture (SRA), as it influences microcrack formation in these
   materials, is considered as an example. A 50 kHz wedge transmitter and a
   100 kHz air-coupled receiver are implemented for the generation and
   detection of nonlinear Rayleigh waves; the non-contact receiver has the
   advantage of eliminating the inconsistencies associated with coupling
   and can be used for inspections of in-service concrete components. The
   experimental results show that the SEA plays a crucial role in reducing
   shrinkage microcracks and the addition of the SRA to cement-based
   materials influences the material nonlinearity. These results
   demonstrate that the proposed SHG technique is capable of evaluating the
   relative nonlinearity parameter, beta(re) and can be a reliable method
   to characterize microstructural changes in cement-based materials. (C)

   extracellular force exertion during mesenchymal stem cell
   differentiation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties within the cell are regulated by the
   organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is linked to the
   extracellular environment through focal adhesion proteins that transmit
   force. Chemical and mechanical stimuli alter the organization of
   cytoskeletal actin, which results in changes in cell shape, adhesion,
   and differentiation. By combining particle-tracking microrheology and
   traction force cytometry, we can monitor the mechanical properties of
   the actin meshwork and determine how changes in the intracellular
   network contribute to force generation. In this study, we investigated
   the effects of chemical (differentiation factors) and mechanical
   (substrate rigidity) stimuli important in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
   differentiation on the intracellular mechanics and traction stress
   generation. We found the presence of adipogenic factors resulted in
   stiffening of the actin meshwork regardless of substrate rigidity. In
   contrast, these factors increased traction stresses on hard substrates,
   which was associated with increased expression of contractility genes.
   Furthermore, MSCs cultured on hard substrates expressed both adipogenic
   and osteogenic markers indicative of mixed differentiation. On hard
   substrates, heterogeneity in the local elastic modulus-traction stress
   correlation was also increased in response to adipogenic factors,
   indicating that these mechanical properties may be reflective of
   differences in the level of MSC differentiation. These results suggest
   intracellular rheology and traction stress generation are spatially
   regulated and contribute insight into how single cell mechanical forces
   contribute to MSC differentiation.}},

Title = {{Stability of functionalized activated carbon in hot liquid water}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{143-154}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Acidity and stability of activated carbon-based solid acid catalysts for
   aqueous-phase reactions are investigated. Carbon is acidified with
   liquid and gas phase methods, using nitric and sulfuric acid, hydrogen
   peroxide and calcination in air at 300 and 400 degrees C. Modified
   carbons are characterized by nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), point of zero charge (PZC) measurements, Boehm
   titration, temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS),
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Stability of acid functional
   groups under typical reaction conditions for biomass conversion is
   investigated by exposing carbons to hydrothermal treatment (i.e. hot
   liquid water). Special attention was devoted to elucidating the effect
   of the temperature (150-225 degrees C) and time of exposure (0-24 h) on
   the hydrothermal stability of different surface functional groups.
   Carbon modification by sulfuric acid generates strong acid sites in
   higher concentration, compared to carbon modified by nitric acid,
   calcination and hydrogen peroxide. In contrast to the other treatments,
   calcination at 400 degrees C increases carbon basicity. Although the
   concentrations of all surface acid sites decrease upon the hydrothermal
   treatment, this effect is not uniform. Stability of acid sites with
   different strengths and their chemical nature are dependent on the
   modification method. Strong acid sites formed by sulfuric acid treatment
   show a much higher stability than those formed by the other
   acidification procedures. The H2SO4-treated material retains ca. 40\% of
   strong acid sites even after exposure to hot liquid water at 200 degrees
   C for more than 4 h. Only such strong acid sites remain on the carbon
   surface after exposure to hot liquid water at 225 degrees C. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An improved, high strength, carbon fiber derived from islands-in-a-sea
   bi-component gel spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-carbon nanotube (CNT)
   precursor fibers containing 1 wt\% mixture of single, double, and few
   walled CNTs was developed. Microscale experiments with properly designed
   MEMS tools provided the mechanical properties of individual, 1-mu m
   diameter carbon filaments, which were isolated from bundles of 407
   fibers. The statistics of the mechanical strength were described well by
   the cumulative Weibull probability density function that resulted in
   characteristic strength of 6.2 GPa and a Weibull modulus of 4.5, while
   the highest tensile strength and Young's modulus values were 7.3 GPa and
   318 GPa, respectively. At the lower end of the spectrum, the strength
   values correlated well with predictions based on an effective flaw size
   obtained from fracture cross-sections. On the other hand, the failure
   cross-sections of the high strength carbon fibers contained a large
   number of long and oriented CNTs but no discernible flaws. The high
   interfacial strength between the CNTs and the surrounding carbon
   resulted in fracture and telescopic pull-out of the CNTs, which was
   corroborated by individual CNT pull-out experiments with MEMS tools
   inside an SEM, and in situ fiber failure observations of telescopic
   pull-out of CNTs inside a TEM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A new hybrid diffusion-transport homogenization method has been
   developed by extending the consistent spatial homogenization (CSH)
   transport method to include diffusion theory. As in the CSH method, an
   ``auxiliary cross section{''} term is introduced into the source term,
   making the resulting homogenized diffusion equation consistent with its
   heterogeneous counterpart. The method then utilizes an on-the-fly
   re-homogenization in transport theory at the assembly level in order to
   correct for core environment effects on the homogenized cross sections
   and the auxiliary cross section. The method has been derived in general
   geometry and tested in a 1-D boiling water reactor (BWR) core benchmark
   problem for both controlled and uncontrolled configurations. The method
   has been shown to converge to the reference solution with less than
   1.7\% average flux error in less than one third the computational time
   as the CSH method - 6 to 8 times faster than fine-mesh transport. (C)

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles have been extensively studied for their catalytic
   activity both theoretically and experimentally. The moire pattern formed
   by graphene supported on single crystal substrates creates a useful
   environment where the properties of Au nanoclusters can be studied,
   provided the structure and evolution of these clusters can be
   controlled. We used a genetic algorithm combined with DFT calculations
   to predict the lowest energy structures of a Au-8 cluster on
   graphene/Ru(0001). The most stable cluster forms a double-layer Au wall
   structure for Au-8 in the fcc region of the moire pattern, where the
   Au-8 cluster is most strongly adsorbed. Further calculations give
   estimates for the net diffusion barrier of Au-8 as an intact cluster on
   the surface. Our results are consistent with the Au island structure
   experimentally observed on graphene/Ru(0001), and support the hypothesis
   that Au clusters aggregate through Oswald ripening with Au dimers being
   the most important diffusing species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Increasing energy demand and growth of wind generation have
   significantly increased the stress on the electric grid. The low
   investment in transmission infrastructure necessitates adoption of
   methods for efficient use of existing resources. Power converter-based
   FACTS devices, capable of dynamic power-flow control, have been the
   preferred solution to maximize utilization of existing infrastructure,
   but implementation of traditional FACTS solutions at transmission level
   voltages is complex and cost prohibitive. This paper proposes a power
   router (PR) for dynamic power-flow control in a meshed network. The
   proposed PR is realized by augmenting a transformer with a fractionally
   rated back-to-back converter. The main advantages of the proposed
   converter are the fractional converter rating and reduced low-frequency
   transformer requirement compared to the traditional FACTS solutions.
   This paper outlines the proposed PR topology, control range, controller
   design and demonstrates the functionality through simulation and
   experimental results.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5204-5217}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a fast and generalized space vector pulse width
   modulation (SVPWM) scheme for any multilevel inverter. The SVPWM scheme
   generates all the available switching states and switching sequences
   based on two simple and general mappings, and calculates the duty cycles
   simply as if for a two-level SVPWM, thus independent of the level number
   of the inverter. Because the switching states, duty cycles, and
   switching sequences are all obtained by simple calculation in the
   proposed SVPWM scheme, no lookup table is needed and the scheme is
   computationally fast. The generalized method of generating the switching
   states (first mapping), calculating the duty cycles, and determining the
   switching sequence (second mapping) is described in this paper. The
   scheme is suitable for any reference vector with any modulation index,
   and can be conveniently extended to meet specific requirements, such as
   symmetric switching sequences. Compared with prior methods, the SVPWM
   scheme proposed in this paper provides two more degrees of freedom,
   i.e., the adjustable switching sequences and duty cycles, thus offering
   significant flexibility for optimizing the performance of multilevel
   inverters. The influence of redundant switching sequences in the output
   phase voltage of inverters is demonstrated for a nine-level inverter.
   This paper also thoroughly compares the proposed SVPWM scheme with prior
   methods. Both simulation and experimental results are given.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental problems and supply of clean and economical energy is
   grand global challenges. Direct decomposition of nitrogen oxides (NOx)
   is the most ideal and effective approach for NOx removal by catalysis,
   which has the great potential to alleviate the air pollution. On the
   other hand, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are one of the cleanest, most
   efficient chemical-to-electrical energy conversion systems. Here we
   reported a new electrochemical system to combine the traditional
   catalyst for direct decomposition of NOx with an electric generation
   process through a SOFC. By nano-sized La0.4Ba0.6Mn0.8Mg0.2O3-delta
   (LBMM), an effective catalyst widely used for NOx decomposition,
   adopting an anode-support SOFC configuration, which consisted with the
   conventional NiO-samarium doped ceria (SDC) anode, and thin film SDC
   electrolyte, we demonstrated that complete decomposition of NO, and a
   peak power density of 25 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C when Ar containing
   5\% NO and 5\% O-2 was fed to the cathode and 10\% H-2 was used the
   fuel. The effect of the ratio between NO and O-2 was found to be
   critical for the NO conversion and SOFC performance. The dependence of
   temperature and gas composition on NO conversion was also investigated.

Abstract = {{Motivated by the need to develop a real-time computation method for
   simultaneous real-time visualization and force/torque feedback for
   manipulating of compliant mechanisms, this paper presents a general
   formulation of a reduced-order discrete state space model and its
   solution as a function of path lengths for a three-dimensional (3-D)
   curvature-based beam model (CBM). Unlike a compliant beam model where
   the boundary value problem is solved using a shooting method, the
   state-space representation decouples the 13th order CBM into two sets of
   reduced-order ordinary differential equations; the first solves for the
   orientation and moment whereas the second describes the deformed beam
   shape. Thus, it enables parallel computation of the deformed shape from
   the solutions to the orientation and moments. As illustrative examples,
   the state-space formulation and real-time computation method have been
   applied to analyze two flexure-based mobile-sensing node (FMN) designs.
   The new design, which overcomes several kinematic limitations and
   practical implementation problems commonly encountered in FMN navigation
   in tight 3-D space, permits bending and twisting of the compliant beam
   in 3-D space. The discrete linear CBM for the two FMN designs has been
   validated experimentally as well as verified by comparing computed
   results against published data and simulations using multishooting
   method and finite-element analysis.}},

   It is imperative, therefore, that models and algorithms designed to
   achieve these objectives be verified before they are validated and
   implemented on-board an aircraft. This paper develops a verification
   approach that builds upon concepts from system analysis, specification
   definition, system modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations. The approach
   is implemented in a hierarchical structure at various levels from
   component to system safety. Salient features of the proposed methodology
   are illustrated through its application to a spacecraft propulsion
   system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel advanced cooling technique for electric machines, which is
   termed the direct winding heat exchanger (DWHX), is presented. This
   technique uses a microfeature enhanced heat exchanger that is inserted
   between the stator winding bundles. The DWHX is innovative, with the
   capability of generating large heat transfer coefficients, i.e., similar
   to 30 000 W/m(2) . K, due to the small channel size and microfeatures.
   This cooling technique significantly reduces the thermal resistance from
   the stator windings to the ambient. The cooling technique is explained
   in detail, and an initial DWHX technology demonstrator electric machine
   is presented. The technology demonstrator is shown to be capable of
   steady current densities in excess of 24.7 A/mm(2) and transient current
   densities in excess of 40 A/mm(2) for class F insulation.}},

Title = {{Statistical methods for interpolating missing meteorological data for
   use in building simulation}},
Journal = {{BUILDING SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{455-465}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Building performance simulation is increasingly used to aid in decision
   making about the design, construction, retrofit, operation, and
   maintenance of new and existing buildings. Such simulations require a
   complete set of meteorological data sampled at regular intervals. A data
   file with even a single missing measurement value becomes useless for
   simulation. Unfortunately, it is extremely rare to find such a perfect
   body of data. Measurement errors and sensor failure are frequent
   occurrences in meteorological data collection and are among a host of
   reasons for missing measurement values. To overcome this problem,
   simulation users may rely on Typical Meteorological Years (TMYs) instead
   of actual historical data, or they may apply an existing interpolation
   method to fill the gaps in historical data. Historical data is often
   preferable, since TMYs fail to account for atypical weather conditions.
   Clearly, this could lead to poor decision making when the decision
   outcomes are strongly affected by the occurrence of atypical conditions.
   This paper presents several methods for statistical interpolation
   between discrete weather-data points. A normalization procedure is first
   used to transform meteorological data into a set of Gaussian-distributed
   sample data. Next, a vector autoregressive model is calibrated using the
   normalized site-specific meteorological data, and is then used to
   determine the most likely value for one or more missing data points.
   Variations of the model are described to address specific combinations
   of missing data, and the methods are validated for several cities in the
   USA. Results show that the normalization procedure is the most important
   contributor towards a significant improvement in accuracy relative to
   other interpolation methods.}},

Title = {{Disturbed Flow Enhances Inflammatory Signaling and Atherogenesis by
   Increasing Thioredoxin-1 Level in Endothelial Cell Nuclei}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Oxidative stress occurs with disturbed blood flow,
   inflammation and cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet freeradical
   scavenging antioxidants have shown limited benefit in human CVD.
   Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is a thiol antioxidant protecting against
   non-radical oxidants by controlling protein thiol/disulfide status; Trx1
   translocates from cytoplasm to cell nuclei due to stress signaling,
   facilitates DNA binding of transcription factors, e.g., NF-kB, and
   potentiates inflammatory signaling. Whether increased nuclear Trx1
   contributes to proatherogenic signaling is unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In vitro and in vivo atherogenic models
   were used to test for nuclear translocation of Trx1 and associated
   proinflammatory signaling. Disturbed flow by oscillatory shear stress
   stimulated Trx1 nuclear translocation in endothelial cells. Elevation of
   nuclear Trx1 in endothelial cells and transgenic (Tg) mice potentiated
   disturbed flow-stimulated proinflammatory signaling including NF-kappa B
   activation and increased expression of cell adhesion molecules and
   cytokines. Tg mice with increased nuclear Trx1 had increased carotid
   wall thickening due to disturbed flow but no significant differences in
   serum lipids or weight gain compared to wild type mice. Redox proteomics
   data of carotid arteries showed that disturbed flow stimulated protein
   thiol oxidation, and oxidation was higher in Tg mice than wild type
   mice.
   Conclusions/Significance: Translocation of Trx1 from cytoplasm to cell
   nuclei plays an important role in disturbed flowstimulated
   proatherogenesis with greater cytoplasmic protein oxidation and an
   enhanced nuclear transcription factor activity. The results suggest that
   pharmacologic interventions to inhibit nuclear translocation of Trx1 may
   provide a new approach to prevent inflammatory diseases or progression.}},

Abstract = {{Biopharmaceuticals are making increasing impact on medicine, including
   treatment of indications in the eye. Macromolecular drugs are typically
   given by physician-administered invasive delivery methods, because
   non-invasive ocular delivery methods, such as eye drops, and systemic
   delivery, have low bioavailability and/or poor ocular targeting. There
   is a need to improve delivery of biopharmaceuticals to enable
   less-invasive delivery routes, less-frequent dosing through
   controlled-release drug delivery and improved drug targeting within the
   eye to increase efficacy and reduce side effects. This review discusses
   the barriers to drug delivery via various ophthalmic routes of
   administration in the context of macromolecule delivery and discusses
   efforts to develop controlled-release systems for delivery of
   biopharmaceuticals to the eye. The growing number of macromolecular
   therapies in the eye needs improved drug delivery methods that increase
   drug efficacy, safety and patient compliance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A two-and-a-half-dimensional (2.5D) platform for enabling silicon
   nano-photonics and dense electrical interconnections between interposers
   in a tile-like configuration is presented. Three 20 x 20 mm silicon
   interposer tiles are assembled directly on an FR4 printed wiring board

   interposer tiles. Accurate alignment of interposer tiles to bridges, an
   important metric in enabling highly efficient optical coupling, is
   provided using positive self-alignment structures (PSASs). It is
   demonstrated that by using PSAS on two silicon substrates, sub-micron
   alignment between substrates is possible; in the cascaded configuration
   involving FR4, < 5 mu m alignment accuracy is obtained. In addition,
   electrical interconnection via a bridge using mechanically flexible
   interconnects (MFIs) is demonstrated, which made non-bonding
   interconnections from one interposer tile to another via a silicon
   bridge, allowing silicon bridges as well as the interposer tiles to be

Abstract = {{Yttrium and indium co-doped barium zirconate is investigated to develop
   a chemically stable and sintering active proton conductor for solid
   oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). BaZr0.8Y0.2-xInxO3-
   possesses a pure cubic perovskite structure. The sintering activity of
   BaZr0.8Y0.2-xInxO3-
   increases significantly with In concentration. BaZr0.8Y0.15In0.05O3-
   (BZYI5) exhibits the highest total electrical conductivity among the
   sintered oxides. BZYI5 also retains high chemical stability against CO2,
   vapor, and reduction of H-2. The good sintering activity, high
   conductivity, and chemical stability of BZYI5 facilitate the fabrication
   of durable SOFCs based on a highly conductive BZYI5 electrolyte film by
   cost-effective ceramic processes. Fully dense BZYI5 electrolyte film is
   successfully prepared on the anode substrate by a facile drop-coating
   technique followed by co-firing at 1400 degrees C for 5 h in air. The
   BZYI5 film exhibits one of the highest conductivity among the
   BaZrO3-based electrolyte films with various sintering aids. BZYI5-based
   single cells output very encouraging and by far the highest peak power
   density for BaZrO3-based proton-conducting SOFCs, reaching as high as
   379 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. The results demonstrate that Y and In
   co-doping is an effective strategy for exploring sintering active and
   chemically stable BaZrO3-based proton conductors for high performance
   proton-conducting SOFCs.}},

Title = {{Important Roles of Enthalpic and Entropic Contributions to CO2 Capture

Abstract = {{The measurement of isosteric heats of adsorption of silica supported
   amine materials in the low pressure range (0-0.1 bar) is critical for
   understanding the interactions between CO2 and amine sites at low
   coverage and hence to the development of efficient amine adsorbents for
   CO2 capture from flue gas and ambient air. Heats of adsorption for an
   array of silica-supported amine materials are experimentally measured at
   low coverage using a Calvet calorimeter equipped with a customized
   dosing manifold. In a series of 3-aminopropyl-functionalized silica
   materials, higher amine densities resulted in higher isosteric heats of
   adsorption, clearly showing that the density/proximity of amine sites
   can influence the amine efficiency of adsorbents. In a series of
   materials with fixed amine loading but different amine types, strongly
   basic primary and secondary amine materials are shown to have
   essentially identical heats of adsorption near 90 kJ/mol. However, the
   adsorption uptakes vary substantially as a function of CO2 partial
   pressure for different primary and secondary amines, demonstrating that
   entropic contributions to adsorption may play a key role in adsorption
   at secondary amine sites, making adsorption at these sites less
   efficient at the low coverages that are important to the direct capture
   of CO2 from ambient air. Thus, while primary amines are confirmed to be
   the most effective amine types for CO2 capture from ambient air, this is
   not due to enhanced enthalpic contributions associated with primary
   amines over secondary amines, but may be due to unfavorable entropic
   factors associated with organization of the second alkyl chain on the
   secondary amine during CO2 adsorption. Given this hypothesis, favorable
   entropic factors may be the main reason primary amine based adsorbents
   are more effective under air capture conditions.}},

Title = {{A `frozen electric-field' approach to simulate repetitively pulsed
   nanosecond plasma discharges and ignition of hydrogen-air mixtures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{38}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{High-fidelity modelling of nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges
   (NRPDs) is burdened by the multiple time and length scales and large
   chemistry mechanisms involved, which prohibit detailed analyses and
   parametric studies. In the present work, we propose a `frozen
   electric-field' modelling approach to expedite the NRPD simulations
   without adverse effects on the solution accuracy. First, a burst of
   nanosecond voltage pulses is simulated self-consistently until the
   discharge reaches a stationary state. The calculated spatial
   distributions and temporal evolution of the electric field, electron
   density and electron energy during the last pulse are then stored in a
   library and the electrical characteristics of subsequent pulses are
   frozen at these values. This strategy allows the timestep for numerical
   integration to be increased by four orders of magnitude (from 10(-13) to
   10(-9) s), thereby significantly improving the computational efficiency
   of the process. Reduced calculations of a burst of 50 discharge pulses
   show good agreement with the predictions from a complete plasma model
   (electrical characteristics calculated during each pulse). The error in
   species densities is less than 20\% at the centre of the discharge
   volume and about 30\% near the boundaries. The deviations in
   temperature, however, are much lower, at 5\% in the entire domain. The
   model predictions are in excellent agreement with measured ignition
   delay times and temperatures in H-2-air mixtures subject to dielectric
   barrier NRPD over a pressure range of 54-144 Torr with equivalence
   ratios of 0.7-1.2. The OH density increases with pressure and triggers
   low-temperature fuel oxidation, which leads to rapid temperature rise
   and ignition. The ignition delay decreases by a factor of 2, with an
   increase in pressure from 54 to 144 Torr. In contrast, an increase in
   the H-2-air equivalence ratio from 0.7 to 1.2 marginally decreases the
   ignition delay by about 20\%. This behaviour is attributed to the
   insensitivity of OH production rates to the variation in the equivalence
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical energy storage devices will play a critical role for
   efficient storage and reliable on-demand supply to portable electronics,
   electric and/or plug-in-electric vehicles that entail rapid
   charging/discharging with long cycle life. The design and assembly of
   nanoscale materials is critical for developing high performance
   mesoporous electrodes for energy storage devices that can be scaled-up
   for manufacturing. To address the challenge of nanostructured electrode
   development, this work reports a layer-by-layer (LbL) fabrication
   technique based on electrostatic self-assembly coupled with vacuum
   assisted filtration. By combining electrostatic interactions with vacuum
   force, thick electrodes (4-50 mu m) of electroactive polyaniline (PANi)
   nanofibers and oxygen functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT)
   are assembled in tens of minutes. The electronic conductivity and
   mechanical stability are further improved through controlled heat
   treatment of these electrodes that shows high surface area with
   interpenetrating networks of nanofibers and nanotubes. Electrochemical
   measurements reveal high specific capacity of 147 mAh/g originating from
   the MWNTs and redox active PANi nanofibers that store charges through
   both electrical double layer and faradaic mechanism with excellent
   charge/discharge stability over 10,000 cycles. The precise control over
   the electrode thickness and rapid assembly from this VA-LbL technique
   show promise for the development of binder-free mesoporous electrodes
   for next generation electrochemical energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Increased flow resistance is responsible for the elevated intraocular
   pressure characteristic of glaucoma, but the cause of this resistance
   increase is not known. We tested the hypothesis that altered
   biomechanical behavior of Schlemm's canal (SC) cells contributes to this
   dysfunction. We used atomic force microscopy, optical magnetic twisting
   cytometry, and a unique cell perfusion apparatus to examine cultured
   endothelial cells isolated from the inner wall of SC of healthy and
   glaucomatous human eyes. Here we establish the existence of a reduced
   tendency for pore formation in the glaucomatous SC cell-likely
   accounting for increased outflow resistance-that positively correlates
   with elevated subcortical cell stiffness, along with an enhanced
   sensitivity to the mechanical microenvironment including altered
   expression of several key genes, particularly connective tissue growth
   factor. Rather than being seen as a simple mechanical barrier to
   filtration, the endothelium of SC is seen instead as a dynamic material
   whose response to mechanical strain leads to pore formation and thereby
   modulates the resistance to aqueous humor outflow. In the glaucomatous
   eye, this process becomes impaired. Together, these observations support
   the idea of SC cell stiffness-and its biomechanical effects on pore
   formation-as a therapeutic target in glaucoma.}},

   small-scale flow features, but pediatric flows are associated with
   higher fluid shear stresses. Platelet damage in the pediatric cases is
   higher than in adult flow, highlighting thrombus complication dangers of
   pediatric BMHV flows. This does not necessarily suggest clinically
   important differences in thromboembolic potential. Highly damaged
   platelets in pediatric flows are primarily found far downstream of the
   valve, as there is less flow recirculation in pediatric flows. In
   addition, damage levels are well below expected thresholds for platelet
   activation. The extent of differences here documented between the
   pediatric and adult cases is of concern, demanding particular attention
   when pediatric valves are designed and manufactured. However, the
   differences between the pediatric and adult cases are not such that
   development of pediatric sized valves is untenable. This study may push
   for eventual approval of prosthetic valves resized for the pediatric
   population. Further studies will be necessary to determine the validity
   and potential thrombotic and clinical implications of these findings.

Title = {{An artificial neural network approach to automatic speech processing}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},

Abstract = {{An artificial neural network (ANN) is a powerful mathematical framework
   used to either model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or
   find patterns in data. It is based on an interconnected group of
   artificial neurons, and it employs a connectionist approach to
   computation when processing information. ANNs have been successfully
   used for a great variety of applications, such as decision making,
   quantum chemistry, radar systems, face identification, gesture
   recognition, handwritten text recognition, medical diagnosis, financial
   applications, robotics, data mining, and e-spam filtering. In the speech
   community, neural architectures have been used since the beginning of
   the 1980s, and ANNs have been proven useful to accomplish several speech
   processing tasks, e.g., to extract linguistically motivated features, to
   perform speech detection, and to generate local scores to be used for
   different goals. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in
   the use of ANNs for speech applications due to a major advance made in
   pre-training the weights in deep neural networks (DNNs). It seems that a
   new trend to move the speech technology forward through the use of NNs
   has begun, and it can therefore be instructive to review key ANN
   applications to automatic speech processing. In this paper, several
   ANN-based applications for speech processing will be presented, ranging
   from speech attribute extraction to phoneme estimation and/or
   classification. Furthermore, it will be shown that ANNs play a key role
   in several important speech applications, such as large vocabulary
   continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) and automatic language
   recognition. The goal of the paper is to summarize chief ANN approaches
   to speech processing using the experience gathered in the last seven
   years in our laboratories. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cysteamine-modified hyaluronic acid (HA) polymer was employed to
   coat quantum dots (QDs) through a convenient one-step reverse micelle
   method, with the final QDs hydrodynamic size of around 22.6 nm. TheHA
   coating renders the QDs with very good stability in PBS for more than
   140 days and resistant to large pH range of 2-12. Besides, the HA-coated
   QDs also show excellent fluorescence stability in BSA-containing cell
   culture medium. In addition, the cell culture assay indicates no
   significant cytotoxicity for MD-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and its
   targeting ability to cancer receptor CD44 has been demonstrated on two
   breast cancer cell lines. The targeting mechanism was further proved by
   the HA competition experiment. This work has established a new approach
   to help solve the stability and toxicity problems of QDs, and moreover
   render the QDs cancer targeting property. The current results indicate
   that the HA polymer-coated QDs hold the potential application for both
   in vitro and in vivo cancer imaging researches.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we extend the simulated moving bed reactor (SMBR) mode
   of operation to the production of propylene glycol methyl ether acetate
   (DOWANOL (TM) PMA glycol ether) through the esterification of
   1-methoxy-2-propanol (DOWANOL (TM) PM glycol ether) and acetic acid
   using AMBERLYST (TM) 15 as a catalyst and adsorbent. In addition, for
   the first time, we integrate the concept of modulation of the feed
   concentration (ModiCon) to SMBR operation. The performance of the
   conventional (constant feed) and ModiCon operation modes of SMBR are
   analyzed and compared. The SMBR processes are designed using a model
   based on a multi-objective optimization approach, where a transport
   dispersive model with a linear driving force for the adsorption rate has
   been used for modeling the SMBR system. The adsorption equilibrium and
   kinetics parameters are estimated from the batch and single column
   injection experiments by the inverse method. The multiple objectives are
   to maximize the production rate of DOWANOL (TM) PMA glycol ether,
   maximize the conversion of the esterification reaction and minimize the
   consumption of DOWANOL (TM) PM glycol ether which also acts as the
   desorbent in the chromatographic separation. It is shown that ModiCon
   achieves a higher productivity by 12-36\% over the conventional
   operation with higher product purity and recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Pages = {{1941-1950}},

Abstract = {{Sphingolipids are a class of lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid
   bases that can be produced de novo through the reaction of palmitate and
   serine and further metabolized through the activity of various enzymes
   to produce intermediates with diverse roles in cellular processes and
   signal transduction. One of these intermediates, sphingosine 1-phosphate
   (S1P), is stored at high concentrations (1 mu M) in red blood cells
   (RBCs) and directs a wide array of cellular processes mediated by 5
   known G-protein coupled receptors (S1P(1)-S1P(5)). In this study, we
   show that RBC membrane alterations in sickle cell disease enhance the
   activation acid sphingomyelinase by 13\%, resulting in increased
   production and storage of sphingosine (2.6-fold) and S1P (3.5-fold). We
   also show that acid sphingomyelinase enhances RBC-derived microparticle
   (MP) generation. These MPs are internalized by myeloid cells and promote
   proinflammatory cytokine secretion and endothelial cell adhesion,
   suggesting that potential crosstalk between circulating inflammatory
   cells and MPs may contribute to the inflammation-rooted pathogenesis of
   the disease. Treatment with amitriptyline reduces MP generation in vitro
   and in vivo and might be used to mitigate inflammatory processes in
   sickle cell disease.}},

Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Cichlid fishes are famous for large, diverse and replicated adaptive
   radiations in the Great Lakes of East Africa. To understand themolecular
   mechanisms underlying cichlid phenotypic diversity, we sequenced the
   genomes and transcriptomes of five lineages of African cichlids: the
   Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an ancestral lineage with low
   diversity; and four members of the East African lineage: Neolamprologus
   brichardi/pulcher (older radiation, Lake Tanganyika), Metriaclima zebra
   (recent radiation, Lake Malawi), Pundamilia nyererei (very recent
   radiation, Lake Victoria), and Astatotilapia burtoni (riverine species
   around Lake Tanganyika). We found an excess of gene duplications in the
   East African lineage compared to tilapia and other teleosts, an
   abundance of non-coding element divergence, accelerated coding sequence
   evolution, expression divergence associated with transposable element
   insertions, and regulation by novel microRNAs. In addition, we analysed
   sequence data from sixty individuals representing six closely related
   species from Lake Victoria, and show genome-wide diversifying selection
   on coding and regulatory variants, some of which were recruited from
   ancient polymorphisms. We conclude that a number of molecular mechanisms
   shaped East African cichlid genomes, and that amassing of standing
   variation during periods of relaxed purifying selection may have been
   important in facilitating subsequent evolutionary diversification.}},

   Epithelial Cell Mechanoactivation of Transforming Growth Factor Beta}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Dysfunctional pulmonary homeostasis and repair, including diseases such
   as pulmonary fibrosis (PF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD), and tumorigenesis have been increasing over the past decade, a
   fact that heavily implicates environmental influences. Several
   investigations have suggested that in response to increased transforming
   growth factor beta (TGF beta) signaling, the alveolar type II (ATII)
   epithelial cell undergoes phenotypic changes that may contribute to the
   complex pathobiology of PF. We have previously demonstrated that
   increased tissue stiffness associated with PF is a potent extracellular
   matrix (ECM) signal for epithelial cell activation of TGF beta. The work
   reported here explores the relationship between tissue stiffness and
   exposure to environmental stimuli in the activation of TGF beta. We
   hypothesized that exposure of ATII cells to fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) will result in enhanced cell contractility, TGF beta activation,
   and subsequent changes to ATII cell phenotype. ATII cells were cultured
   on increasingly stiff substrates with or without addition of PM2.5.
   Exposure to PM2.5 resulted in increased activation of TGF beta,
   increased cell contractility, and elongation of ATII cells. Most
   notably, on 8 kPa substrates, a stiffness greater than normal but less
   than established fibrotic lung, addition of PM2.5 resulted in increased
   cortical cell stiffness, enhanced actin staining and cell elongation; a
   result not seen in the absence of PM2.5. Our work suggests that PM2.5
   exposure additionally enhances the existing interaction between ECM
   stiffness and TGF beta that has been previously reported. Furthermore,
   we show that this additional enhancement is likely a consequence of
   intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to increased TGF
   beta signaling events. These results highlight the importance of both
   the micromechanical and biochemical environment in lung disease
   initiation and suggest that individuals in early stages of lung
   remodeling during fibrosis may be more susceptible than healthy
   individuals when exposed to environmental injury adjuvants.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a computer-based first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo
   (CF-KMC) model to predict degradation mechanisms and fates of
   intermediates and byproducts produced from the degradation of
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide
   (UV/H2O2). The CF-KMC model is composed of a reaction pathway generator,
   a reaction rate constant estimator, and a KMC solver. The KMC solver is
   able to solve the predicted pathways successfully without solving
   ordinary differential equations. The predicted time-dependent profiles
   of averaged molecular weight, and polydispersitivity index (i.e., the
   ratio of the weight-averaged molecular weight to the number-averaged
   molecular weight) for the PEG degradation were validated with
   experimental observations. These predictions are consistent with the
   experimental data. The model provided detailed and quantitative insights
   into the time evolutions of molecular weight distribution and
   concentration profiles of low molecular weight products and functional
   groups. Our approach may be useful to predict the fates of degradation
   products for a wide range of complicated organic contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary microbial monitoring of aquifers relies on groundwater
   samples to enumerate nonattached cells of interest. One-dimensional
   column studies quantified the distribution of bacterial cells in solid
   and the aqueous phases as a function of microbial species, growth
   substrate availability and porous medium (i.e., Appling soil versus
   Federal Fine Ottawa sand with 0.75\% and 0.01\% {[}w/w] organic carbon,
   respectively). Without supplied growth substrates, effluent from columns
   inoculated with the tetrachloroethene- (PCE-) to-ethene-dechlorinating
   bacterial consortium BDI-SZ containing Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc)
   strains and Geobacter lovleyi strain SZ (GeoSZ), or inoculated with
   Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain W (AdehalW), captured 94-96, 81-99,
   and 73-84\% of the Dhc, GeoSZ, and AdehalW cells, respectively. Cell
   retention was organism-specific and increased in the order Dhc < GeoSZ <
   AdehalW. When amended with 10 mM lactate and 0.11 mM PCE, aqueous
   samples accounted for 1.3-27 and 0.02-22\% of the total Dhc and GeoSZ
   biomass, respectively. In Appling soil, up to three orders-of-magnitude
   more cells were associated with the solid phase, and attachment rate
   coefficients (katt) were consistently greater compared to Federal Fine
   sand. Cell-solid interaction energies ranged from -2.5 to 787 kT and
   were consistent with organism-specific deposition behavior, where GeoSZ
   and AdehalW exhibited greater attachment than Dhc cells. The observed
   disparities in microbial cell distributions between the aqueous and
   solid phases imply that groundwater analysis can underestimate the total
   cell abundance in the aquifer by orders-of-magnitude under conditions of
   growth and in porous media with elevated organic carbon content. The
   implications of these findings for monitoring chlorinated solvent sites
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The innovations of science often point to ideas and behaviors that must
   spread and take root in communities to have impact. Ideas, practices,
   and behaviors need to go from accepted truths on the part of a few
   scientists to commonplace beliefs and norms in the minds of the many.
   Moving from scientific discoveries to public good requires social
   influence. We introduce a structured influence process (SIP) framework
   to explain how social networks (i. e., the structure of social
   influence) and human social motives (i. e., the process of social
   influence wherein one person's attitudes and behaviors affect another's)
   are used collectively to enact social influence within a community. The
   SIP framework advances the science of scientific communication by
   positing social influence events that consider both the ``who{''} and
   the ``how{''} of social influence. This framework synthesizes core ideas
   from two bodies of research on social influence. The first is network
   research on social influence structures, which identifies who are the
   opinion leaders and who among their network of peers shapes their
   attitudes and behaviors. The second is research on social influence
   processes in psychology, which explores how human social motives such as
   the need for accuracy or the need for affiliation stimulate behavior
   change. We illustrate the practical implications of the SIP framework by
   applying it to the case of reducing neonatal mortality in India.}},

Abstract = {{Eleven persistent organic pollutant (POP) compounds including Sigma
   PCBs, Sigma DDTs, Sigma HCHs, aldrin, mirex, endrin, Sigma CHLs,

   stranded on the western coast of the Pearl River Estuary in China during
   2007-2013. For most parameters of POPs measured, melon tissues contained
   the highest mean concentrations with the exception of aldrin, which was
   higher in the kidney and liver tissues. The concentrations of PCBs,
   DDTs, heptachlor and endrin in the melon tissue exhibited significant
   correlations with body length, whereas PCBs and heptachlor also
   displayed significant regression with age. Our studies showed hepatic
   concentrations of Sigma DDTs, Sigma HCHs and mirex in S. chinensis were
   generally higher than those found in cetaceans from other geographic
   locations. The high levels of POP residues in the testis of one male
   dolphin suggested an increasing risk of infertility in the species. (C)

Abstract = {{Non-invasive assessment of ventilatory control stability or loop gain
   (which is a key contributor in a number of sleep-related breathing
   disorders) has proven to be cumbersome. We present a novel multivariate
   autoregressive model that we hypothesize will enable us to make
   time-varying measurements of loop gain using nothing more than
   spontaneous fluctuations in ventilation and CO2. The model is adaptive
   to changes in the feedback control loop and therefore can account for
   system non-stationarities (e.g. changes in sleep state) and it is
   resistant to artifacts by using a signal quality measure. We tested this
   method by assessing its ability to detect a known increase in loop gain
   induced by proportional assist ventilation (PAV). Subjects were studied
   during sleep while breathing on continuous positive airway pressure
   (CPAP) alone (to stabilize the airway) or on CPAP + PAV. We show that
   the method tracked the PAV-induced increase in loop gain, demonstrating
   its time-varying capabilities, and it remained accurate in the face of
   measurement related artifacts. The model was able to detect a
   statistically significant increase in loop gain from 0.14 +/- 10 on CPAP
   alone to 0.21 +/- 0.13 on CPAP + PAV (p < 0.05). Furthermore, our method
   correctly detected that the PAV-induced increase in loop gain was
   predominantly driven by an increase in controller gain. Taken together,
   these data provide compelling evidence for the validity of this
   technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Cell-based insulin therapies can potentially improve glycemic
   regulation in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Enteroendocrine cells
   engineered to secrete recombinant insulin have exhibited glycemic
   efficacy, but have been primarily studied as uncontrollable growth
   systems in immune incompetent mice. Furthermore, reports suggest that
   suboptimal insulin secretion remains a barrier to expanded application.
   Methods Genetic and tissue engineering strategies were applied to
   improve recombinant insulin secretion from intestinal L-cells on both a
   per-cell and per-graft basis. Transduction of insulin-expressing GLUTag
   L-cells with lentivirus carrying an additional human insulin
   gene-enhanced secretion twofold. We infected cells with lentivirus
   expressing a luciferase reporter gene to track cell survival in vivo. To
   provide a growth-controlled and immune protective environment without
   affecting secretory capacity, cells were microencapsulated in barium
   alginate. Approximately 9x10(7) microencapsulated cells were injected
   intraperitoneally in immune competent streptozotocin-induced diabetic
   mice for therapeutic efficacy evaluation.
   Results Graft insulin secretion was increased to 16 to 24 mU insulin per
   day. Transient normoglycemia was achieved in treated mice two days after
   transplantation, and endogenous insulin was sufficient to sustain body
   weights of treated mice receiving minimal supplementation.
   Conclusion Glycemic efficacy of a bioartificial pancreas based on
   insulin-secreting enteroendocrine cells is insufficient as a standalone
   therapy, despite enhancement of graft insulin secretion capacity.
   Supplemental strategies to alleviate secretion limitations should be
   pursued.}},

Abstract = {{Air quality forecasts generated with chemical transport models can
   provide valuable information about the potential impacts of fires on
   pollutant levels. However, significant uncertainties are associated with
   fire-related emission estimates as well as their distribution on gridded
   modeling domains. In this study, we explore the sensitivity of fine
   particulate matter concentrations predicted by a regional-scale air
   quality model to the spatial and temporal allocation of fire emissions.
   The assessment was completed by simulating a fire-related smoke episode
   in which air quality throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area was
   affected on February 28, 2007. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to
   evaluate the significance of emission distribution among the model's
   vertical layers, along the horizontal plane, and into hourly inputs.
   Predicted PM2.5 concentrations were highly sensitive to emission
   injection altitude relative to planetary boundary layer height.
   Simulations were also responsive to the horizontal allocation of fire
   emissions and their distribution into single or multiple grid cells.
   Additionally, modeled concentrations were greatly sensitive to the
   temporal distribution of fire-related emissions. The analyses
   demonstrate that, in addition to adequate estimates of emitted mass,
   successfully modeling the impacts of fires on air quality depends on an
   accurate spatiotemporal allocation of emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   design optimization of high-performance structures}},
Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Structural optimization using gradient-based methods is a powerful
   design technique that is well suited for the design of high-performance
   structures. However, the ever-increasing complexity of finite-element
   models and design formulations results in a bottleneck in the
   computation of the gradients required for the design optimization.
   Furthermore, in light of current high-performance computing trends, any
   methods intended to address this bottleneck must efficiently utilize
   parallel computing resources. Therefore, there is a need for solution
   and gradient evaluation methods that scale well with the number of
   design variables, constraints, and processors. We address this need by
   developing an integrated parallel finite-element analysis tool for
   gradient-based design optimization that is designed to use specialized
   parallel solution methods to solve large-scale high-fidelity structural
   optimization problems with thousands of design variables, millions of
   state variables, and hundreds of load cases. We describe the most
   relevant details of the parallel algorithms used within the tool. We
   present consistent constraint formulations and aggregation techniques
   for both material failure and buckling constraints. To demonstrate both
   the solution and functional accuracy, we compare our results to an exact
   solution of a pressure-loaded cylinder made with either isotropic or
   orthotropic material. To demonstrate the parallel solution and gradient
   evaluation performance, we perform a structural analysis and gradient
   evaluation for a large transport aircraft wing with over 5.44 million
   unknowns. The results show near-ideal scalability of the structural
   solution and gradient computation with the number of design variables,
   constraints, and processors, which makes this framework well suited for
   large-scale high-fidelity structural design optimization. (C) 2014

Pages = {{219-223}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{The hydroxyl radical (OH) is a key oxidant involved in the removal of
   air pollutants and greenhouse gases from the atmosphere(1-3). The ratio
   of Northern Hemispheric to Southern Hemispheric (NH/SH) OH concentration
   is important for our understanding of emission estimates of atmospheric
   species such as nitrogen oxides and methane(4-6). It remains poorly
   constrained, however, with a range of estimates from 0.85 to 1.4 (refs
   4,7-10). Here we determine the NH/SH ratio of OH with the help of methyl
   chloroform data (a proxy for OH concentrations) and an atmospheric
   transport model that accurately describes interhemispheric transport and
   modelled emissions. We find that for the years 2004-2011 the model
   predicts an annual mean NH-SH gradient of methyl chloroform that is a
   tight linear function of the modelled NH/SH ratio in annual mean OH. We
   estimate a NH/SH OH ratio of 0.97 +/- 0.12 during this time period by
   optimizing global total emissions and mean OH abundance to fit methyl
   chloroform data from two surface-measurement networks and aircraft
   campaigns(11-13). Our findings suggest that top-down emission estimates
   of reactive species such as nitrogen oxides in key emitting countries in
   the NH that are based on a NH/SH OH ratio larger than 1 may be
   overestimated.}},

Abstract = {{In this Feature Article, we discussed the experimental and modeling
   methods and analyzed the limitations of the surface probing of
   nanomechanical properties of polymeric and biological materials in
   static and dynamic regimes with atomic force microscopy (AFM), which are
   widely utilized currently. To facilitate such measurements with
   minimized ambiguities, in this study we present a combined method to
   evaluate the viscoelastic properties of compliant polymeric materials.
   We collected forcedistance data in the static regime for a benchmark
   polymer material (poly(n-butyl methacrylate)) with an easily accessible
   glass-transition temperature (about 25 degrees C) at different loading
   rates and different temperatures across the glassy state,
   glass-transition region, and rubbery state. For this analysis, we
   exploited a Johnson-modified Sneddons approach in a combination with the
   standard linear solid model. Critical experimental steps suggested for
   robust probing are (i) the use of a tip with a well-characterized
   parabolic shape, (ii) probing in a liquid environment in order to reduce
   jump-in phenomenon, and (iii) minute indentations to ensure the absence
   of plastic deformation. Whereas the standard Sneddons model generates
   quantitatively adequate elastic modulus values below and above the glass
   transition, this traditional approach can significantly underestimate
   actual modulus values in the vicinity of the glass-transition region (15
   degrees C above or below T-g), with major deviations occurring at the
   loss tangent peak. The analysis of the experimental data with Sneddons
   model for the elastic region (glassy and rubbery states) and Johnsons
   model for the viscoelastic region allowed for the restoration of the
   universal master curve and the evaluation of the storage modulus, loss
   modulus, loss tangent, relaxation times, and activation energies of the
   polymer surface across the glass-transition region and at relevant
   loading rates.}},

Abstract = {{The geometrical formulation of continuum mechanics provides us with a
   powerful approach to understand and solve problems in anelasticity where
   an elastic deformation is combined with a non-elastic component arising
   from defects, thermal stresses, growth effects or other effects leading
   to residual stresses. The central idea is to assume that the material
   manifold, prescribing the reference configuration for a body, has an
   intrinsic, non-Euclidean, geometrical structure. Residual stresses then
   naturally arise when this configuration is mapped into Euclidean space.
   Here, we consider the problem of discombinations (a new term that we
   introduce in this paper), that is, a combined distribution of fields of
   dislocations, disclinations and point defects. Given a discombination,
   we compute the geometrical characteristics of the material manifold
   (curvature, torsion, non-metricity), its Cartan's moving frames and
   structural equations. This identification provides a powerful algorithm
   to solve semi-inverse problems with non-elastic components. As an
   example, we calculate the residual stress field of a cylindrically
   symmetric distribution of discombinations in an infinite circular
   cylindrical bar made of an incompressible hyperelastic isotropic elastic
   solid.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent, flexible and highly efficient power sources are essential
   components of mobile electronics and optoelectronic devices. Here, based
   on the first generation of the transparent triboelectric nano-generator
   (TENG), we demonstrate a simple and innovative design that can
   simultaneously improve the output performance and transmittance of the
   TENG. The improved TENG gives a maximum output up to 200 V and 7 mu A at
   a current density of similar to 0.78 mu A cm(-2). The TENG shows a high
   transmittance of similar to 78\%. To deeply understand the nature of the
   triboelectric effect, we investigated the influence of the UV-ozone
   treatment, surface properties, and surrounding environment on the output
   performance. Integrating the characterization results, we conclude that
   the tribocharge generation of the PDMS surface is probably due to the
   bond breaking of Si-O-Si groups, and is closely related to the surface
   properties and surrounding environment.}},

Title = {{Robust multicomponent IR-to-concentration model regression}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{77-90}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Infrared absorbance measurements can be made in situ and rapidly.
   Calibrating these measurements to give solution compositions can
   therefore yield a powerful tool for process monitoring and control. In
   many applications it is desirable to monitor the concentrations of
   multiple components in a complex solution under varying process
   conditions (which may introduce error in the absorbance measurements).
   Establishing a model that is capable of accurately predicting the
   concentrations of multiple components from infrared absorbance
   measurements that may be corrupted by error requires a carefully
   designed calibration procedure-a key part of which is model regression.
   In this article, a number of commonly used multivariate regression
   techniques are examined in the context of developing a model for
   simultaneously predicting the concentrations of four solutes from noisy
   infrared absorbance measurements. In addition, a tailored support vector
   regression algorithm-designed to produce a robust (measurement
   error-insensitive) calibration model-is developed, tested, and compared
   against these established regression algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Dry-jet wet-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PAN/carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   precursor fibers coated by spin finishes were characterized using the
   solid-state H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Series of fiber
   samples were prepared upon thermal treatment at different temperatures
   (room temperature to 180 degrees C). Using the Hahn echo sequence,
   relatively mobile components were identified and the effect of the heat
   treatment on those components was studied. It was observed that the
   mobile components are mainly the spin finishes. Heat treatment caused
   loss of one of the spin finishes (Type B) to a great extent (similar to
   80\%), whereas the other two spin finishes (Type A and Type C) were more
   stable. Additional information regarding the change in molecular
   mobility due to heat treatment was obtained by the spin-lattice
   relaxation time (T-1) analysis. It was found that the presence of CNT
   affects the T-1 relaxation time of the polymer in the composite fiber,
   however, that of relatively mobile components remains unaffected. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding the crystal-size dependence of both guest adsorption and
   structural transitions of nanoporous solids is crucial to the
   development of these materials. We find that nano-sized metal organic
   framework (MOF) crystals have significantly different guest adsorption
   properties compared to the bulk material. A new methodology is developed
   to simulate the adsorption and transition behavior of entire MOF
   nanoparticles. Our simulations predict that the transition pressure
   significantly increases with decreasing particle size, in agreement with
   crystal-size-dependent experimental measurements of the N-2-ZIF-8
   system. We also propose a simple core shell model to examine this effect
   on length scales that are inaccessible to simulations and again find
   good agreement with experiments. This study is the first to examine
   particle size effects on structural transitions in ZIFs and provides a
   thermodynamic framework for understanding the underlying mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the economic impact of a new biorefinery on
   an established timberlands system. This paper proposes that a single
   level model does not adequately represent the interactions in the supply
   chain. The timberlands system has two major decision makers: harvesters
   and manufacturers. Bilevel models are two-level turn-based models with
   each level representing a decision maker. The two levels are
   interconnected, but neither has control over the decisions of the other.
   The leader makes an initial decision, and the follower reacts; the
   leader can anticipate the follower's reaction. To demonstrate the value
   of this more complex representation, a single period bilevel and a
   single period single level model were formulated for a representative
   case study. The separation of objective functions in the bilevel problem
   yielded decisions different from those of the single level formulation.
   It was concluded that the bilevel model may more accurately represent
   the real system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Towards Practical Application of Paper based Printed Circuits:
   Capillarity Effectively Enhances Conductivity of the Thermoplastic
   Electrically Conductive Adhesives}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Direct printing nanoparticle-based conductive inks onto paper substrates
   has encountered difficulties e.g. the nanoparticles are prone to
   penetrate into the pores of the paper and become partially segmented,
   and the necessary low-temperature-sintering process is harmful to the
   dimension-stability of paper. Here we prototyped the paper-based circuit
   substrate in combination with printed thermoplastic electrically
   conductive adhesives (ECA), which takes the advantage of the capillarity
   of paper and thus both the conductivity and mechanical robustness of the
   printed circuits were drastically improved without sintering process.
   For instance, the electrical resistivity of the ECA specimen on a pulp
   paper (6 x 10(-5)Omega.cm, with 50 wt\% loading of Ag) was only 14\% of
   that on PET film than that on PET film. This improvement has been found
   directly related to the sizing degree of paper, in agreement with the
   effective medium approximation simulation results in this work. The
   thermoplastic nature also enables excellent mechanical strength of the
   printed ECA to resist repeated folding. Considering the generality of
   the process and the wide acceptance of ECA technique in the modern
   electronic packages, this method may find vast applications in e.g.
   circuit boards, capacitive touch pads, and radio frequency
   identification antennas, which have been prototyped in the manuscript.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive exfoliated graphite nanoplatelet (GNP) /
   polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposite films were fabricated using a
   two-step, scalable melt compounding process. The effect of the polymer's
   physical properties, such as crystallinity, on the mechanical and
   electrical properties of the composites were determined. The
   crystallization characteristics of PLAwere altered significantly by
   altering the cooling rate during compression molding of the films. The
   crystallinity and crystal structure were investigated using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and
   polarized optical microscopy (POM). The mechanical and electrical
   properties were also examined as a function of PLA's crystallinity
   dictated by the cooling rate during compression molding. The electrical
   conductivity was examined using impedance spectroscopy. For the same GNP
   content, the crystallinity increases by similar to 40 \% and electrical
   conductivity increases by similar to 3 orders of magnitude with
   decreased cooling rate indicating a strong correlation between polymer
   physical properties and electrical conductivity of the polymer
   composites. This mechanism can be utilized to tailor the electrical
   conductivity of a given filler/polymer system by tuning the physical
   properties of the polymer, without altering the fillers' characteristics
   or the processing method, which is the common approach used.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen transport in amorphous poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) was studied
   at various temperatures using complementary permeation and
   pressure-decay sorption techniques. A significant reduction in oxygen
   permeability of similar to 11x was observed at 35 degrees C for PEF
   compared to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and is attributed
   primarily to reduction in chain segment mobility for PEF resulting from
   a hindrance of furan ring flipping. A custom-built high accuracy
   sorption system allowed determination of temperature-dependent so-called
   dual-mode parameters that have not been reported for oxygen in any
   polyester. Energetic parameters, i.e. the enthalpy of sorption and
   activation energies of diffusion and permeation, were measured for
   oxygen in PEF and discussed in the context of PET and related
   polyesters. The current work presents the first detailed study of
   penetrant transport in PEF, which demonstrates the impressive
   performance enhancements of PEF compared to PET. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   Mechanical Heart Valves at Different Implantation Angles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEART VALVE DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{642-650}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: The effects of the implantation angle
   of bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs) on the sinus region and
   downstream flow profiles were investigated. Three-dimensional numerical
   simulations of BMHVs were performed under physiologic pulsatile flow
   conditions. The study aim was to examine how the flow fields of
   different aortic sinus shapes and the downstream aortic arch geometry
   would be affected by implantation angle.
   Methods: Two geometric models of sinus were investigated: a simplified
   axisymmetric sinus; and a three-sinus aortic root model, with two
   different downstream geometries, namely a straight pipe and a simplified
   curved aortic arch. A 29 mm St. Jude Medical BMHV geometric model was
   used and positioned at four different angles (0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60
   degrees and 90 degrees).
   Results: The simulation results showed variation in downstream flow
   profiles at different implantation angles. Generally, at position Z = 1D
   along the centerline (where Z refers to the axis normal to the x-y plane
   and D is the inlet diameter), the triple-jet structures were observed
   with a slight shift of the center jet for three-sinus aortic cases.
   Apparent differences were observed at position Z = 2D and 4D, such as
   higher velocity profiles at the inner arch wall. The flow field
   downstream of the valve implanted at 0 degrees (anatomic position)
   showed the smallest overall asymmetry at peak systole, while the flow
   field downstream of the valve implanted at 90 degrees (anti-anatomic
   position) exhibited high regions of recirculation.
   Conclusion: Valve orientation was found not to affect the shear stress
   distribution significantly in the downstream aorta, and this was in
   agreement with the findings of earlier studies.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation modeling has traditionally relied on historical signals to
   estimate the behavior of the underlying degradation process. Many models
   assume that these historical signals are acquired under the same
   environmental conditions and can be observed along the entire lifespan
   of a component. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and present a
   more general statistical framework for modeling degradation signals that
   may have been collected under different types of environmental
   conditions. In addition, we consider applications where the historical
   signals are not necessarily observed continuously, that is, historical
   signals are sparse or fragmented. We consider the case where historical
   degradation signals are collected under known environmental states and
   another case where the environmental conditions are unknown during the
   acquisition of these historical data. For the first case, we use a
   classification algorithm to identify the environmental state of the
   units operating in the field. In the second case, a clustering step is
   required for clustering the historical degradation signals. The proposed
   model can provide accurate predictions of the lifetime or residual life
   distributions of engineering components that are still operated in the
   field. This is demonstrated by using simulated degradation signals as
   well as vibration-based degradation signals acquired from a rotating
   machinery setup.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, numerous experimental and numerical efforts
   have examined physical phenomena in plasma discharge devices. The
   physical mechanisms that govern the anomalous electron diffusion from
   the cathode to the anode in the Hall Effect Thruster (HET) are not fully

   understanding and gain insight into the effect of the anomalous electron
   diffusion in the HET. To this end, numerical solutions are compared with
   various experimental HET performance measurements and the effects of
   anomalous electron diffusion are analyzed. The relationships between the
   anomalous electron diffusion and important parameters of the HET are

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a digital phase demodulation technique for
   resonant MEMS gyroscopes. The proposed method converts the
   amplitude-modulated Coriolis signal of the gyroscope into a digital
   phase-modulated output by utilizing the quadrature component of the
   sense signal. The rate information is extracted from the digital
   phase-modulated output using an XOR gate as a digital multiplier.
   Besides offering more robustness to low-frequency amplitude noise
   sources due to its phase-based operation, the proposed scheme enables
   direct time-domain digitization of the gyroscope signal at carrier
   frequency to avoid additional noise folding by the down-conversion
   multiplier in conventional amplitude demodulation. In addition, due to
   its digital nature, the proposed phase-based scheme offers better design
   scalability for deep-submicrometer CMOS implementations. As a proof of
   concept, the proposed phase demodulation architecture is interfaced with
   a low-bias-drift mode-matched tuning fork gyroscope. A scale factor of
   240 mV/degrees/s with sub-0.001 degrees/s detectable rate is measured.
   The complete system exhibits a low bias instability of 0.55 degrees/h
   and an angle random walk of 0.12 degrees/root h.}},

Abstract = {{As ac-to-ac power conversion becomes increasingly important in
   applications such as grid power control and motor control, demand for a
   plug-and-play converter has increased. Traditional
   voltage-source-inverter-based ac-to-ac power converters such as the
   back-to-back converter require dc-link capacitors that limit their
   reliability or significantly increase their size and cost. This paper
   examines a plug-and-play concept for achieving ac-to-ac power conversion
   via the direct-ac/ac power electronic building block (AC-PEBB). The
   AC-PEBB is a compact self-contained cell requiring no intermediate
   energy storage. It can be used in a variety of ac/ac power electronic
   applications such as matrix converters and controllable network
   transformers. This paper details the design of an 800-V 100-A AC-PEBB
   prototype to be used in a 13-kV 1-MVA application. Successful test
   results using several AC-PEBBs in a variety of configurations are
   demonstrated at up to 11 kV and 600 kVA.}},

   provides methods for scaling and coordinating multiple generator/capture
   systems, and supports 6.25 ns timestamp resolution with clock drift and
   phase coordination maintained by GPS input. Additionally, our approach
   has demonstrated lower-cost than comparable commercial systems while
   achieving comparable levels of precision and accuracy; all within an

Abstract = {{An optimal feedback policy is designed for a stochastic colloidal
   assembly process using dynamic programming. Actuator-parameterized
   Langevin equations describe the system dynamics of an electric-field
   mediated assembly process, and are used to construct a discrete-state
   Markov chain model for input to the Markov decision process (MDP)
   framework. The state of the system is based on an order parameter
   representing the overall system configuration, as it transitions from a
   fluid to a crystalline state. The MDP-based optimal control policy is
   computed for both the finite-and infinite-horizon cases, with design
   goals based on maximizing crystallinity. Simulations show that the
   proposed MDP-based policies are able to drive the system rapidly to the
   desired high-crystallinity state, or to reach a desired tradeoff between
   high crystallinity and low control effort.}},

Abstract = {{3-D integrated circuits (3-D ICs) are expected to have shorter
   wirelength, better performance, and less power consumption than 2-D ICs.
   These benefits come from die stacking and use of through-silicon vias
   (TSVs) fabricated for interconnections across dies. However, the use of
   TSVs has several negative impacts such as area and capacitance overhead.
   To predict the quality of 3-D ICs more accurately, TSV-aware 3-D
   wirelength distribution models considering the negative impacts were
   developed. In this paper, we apply an optimal buffer insertion algorithm
   to the TSV-aware 3-D wirelength distribution models and present various
   prediction results on wirelength, delay, and power consumption of 3-D
   ICs. We also apply the framework to 2-D and 3-D ICs built with various

Abstract = {{An application is said to be soft real-time if it is able to tolerate
   occasional violations of its timing constraints. The overall CPU
   utilization of a soft real-time system can be improved by exploiting the
   relaxed nature of its timing constraints. One possible approach is by
   adapting CPU-budgets in reservation-based schedulers. Reservation-based
   schedulers allow parts of the system and groups of tasks to be isolated
   from one another. By making the reservations adaptive, resources such as
   CPU can be allocated to tasks based on current usage rather than
   worst-case usage, which can help to improve the overall utilization of
   CPU time committed to tasks. This paper presents an adaptive budget
   allocation algorithm where the allocated budget is adapted at
   reservation-period boundaries based on predictions of future CPU usage.
   This approach differs from previous algorithms where adaptations are
   performed on job completion. Simulation results show that adaptations at
   reservation-period boundaries allow for a faster response time. Results
   from experiments performed on a prototype demonstrate the robustness and
   effectiveness of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Before fast, inexpensive digital electronics became commonplace, analog
   techniques dominated the field of music synthesis. Over time, much of
   the art has moved to the digital domain, which allows for greater
   flexibility than traditional analog systems. Many enthusiasts still
   argue that the ``warmth{''} of analog systems is difficult to recreate
   digitally. Recent developments concerning Field-Programmable Analog
   Arrays may permit the creation of analog synthesizers that enjoy the
   ease of rapid reconfigurability previously associated only with digital
   synthesizers, allowing musicians to characterize individual circuit
   elements and try different topologies. This paper presents an
   implementation of a particularly famous voltage-controlled filter
   design, namely, the transistor ladder filter. The original formulation,
   which was based on BJTs, readily maps to MOSFETs operating in the
   subthreshold region. The implementation is aided by the use of
   high-level software design tools in Simulink.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cancer cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium is a critical step of
   tumour metastasis. Endothelial surface molecule Thy-1 (CD90) is
   implicated in the metastatic process through its interactions with
   integrins and syndecans. However, how Thy-1 supports cell-cell adhesion
   in a dynamic mechanical environment is not known. Here we show that
   Thy-1 supports beta(1) integrin- and syndecan-4 (Syn4)-mediated
   contractility-dependent mechanosignalling of melanoma cells. At the
   single-molecule level, Thy-1 is capable of independently binding
   alpha(5)beta(1) integrin and syndecan-4 (Syn4) receptors. However, in
   the presence of both alpha(5)beta(1) and Syn4, the two receptors bind
   cooperatively to Thy-1, to form a trimolecular complex. This
   trimolecular complex displays a unique phenomenon we coin `dynamic
   catch', characterized by abrupt bond stiffening followed by the
   formation of catch bonds, where force prolongs the bond lifetime. Thus,
   we reveal a new class of trimolecular interactions where force
   strengthens the synergistic binding of two co-receptors and modulates
   downstream mechanosignalling.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a dynamic traveling salesman problem (TSP) with stochastic

   which the cost of a decision is known only probabilistically beforehand

   formulate this as a dynamic program (DP) and compare it to static
   counterparts to demonstrate the advantage of the dynamic paradigm over
   an a priori approach. We then apply approximate linear programming (ALP)
   to overcome the DP's curse of dimensionality, obtain a semi-infinite
   linear programming lower bound, and discuss its tractability. We also
   analyze a rollout version of the price-directed policy implied by our
   ALP and derive worst-case guarantees for its performance. Our
   computational study demonstrates the quality of a heuristically modified
   rollout policy using a computationally effective a posteriori bound.}},

Abstract = {{Electric double layer capacitors, also called supercapacitors,
   ultracapacitors, and electrochemical capacitors, are gaining increasing
   popularity in high power energy storage applications. Novel carbon
   materials with high surface area, high electrical conductivity, as well
   as a range of shapes, sizes and pore size distributions are being
   constantly developed and tested as potential supercapacitor electrodes.
   This article provides an overview of the electrochemical studies on
   activated carbon, carbide derived carbon, zeolite-templated carbon,
   carbon aerogel, carbon nanotube, onion-like carbon, and graphene. We
   discuss the key performance advantages and limitations of various
   nanostructured carbon materials and provide an overview of the current
   understanding of the structure-property relationships related to the
   transport and adsorption of electrolyte ions on their surfaces, specific
   and volumetric capacitance, self-discharge, cycle life, electrolyte
   stability, and others. We discuss the impact of microstructural defects,
   pore size distribution, pore tortuosity, chemistry and functional groups
   on the carbon surface, nanoscale curvature, and carbon-electrolyte
   interfacial energy. Finally, we review state-of-the art commercial large
   scale applications of supercapacitors, including their use in smart

Title = {{Analysis of thermomechanical response of polycrystalline HMX under
   impact loading through mesoscale simulations}},
Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the response of polycrystalline HMX
   (Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7- tetrazocine) under impact loading
   through a 3-dimensional mesoscale model that explicitly accounts for
   anisotropic elasticity, crystalline plasticity, and heat conduction.
   This model is used to quantify the variability in temperature and stress
   fields due to random distributions of the orientations of crystalline
   grains in HMX under the loading scenarios considered. The simulations
   carried out concern the response of fully dense HMX polycrystalline
   ensembles under impact loading at imposed boundary velocities from 50 to
   400 m/s. The polycrystalline ensemble studied consists of a
   geometrically arranged distribution of bi-modally sized and shaped
   grains. To quantify the effect of crystalline slip, two models with
   different numbers of available slip systems are used, reflecting
   differing characterizations of the slip systems of the HMX molecular
   crystal in the literature. The effects of microstructure and anisotropy
   on the distribution of heating and stress evolution are investigated.
   The results obtained indicate that crystalline response anisotropy at
   the microstructure level plays an important role in influencing both the
   overall response and the localization of stress and temperature. The
   overall longitudinal stress is up to 16\% higher and the average
   temperature rise is only half in the material with fewer potential slip
   systems compared to those in the material with more available slip
   systems. Local stresses can be as high as twice the average stresses.
   The results show that crystalline anisotropy induces significant
   heterogeneities in both mechanical and thermal fields that previously
   have been neglected in the analyses of the behavior of HMX-based
   energetic materials. (C) 2014 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Connectivity refers to the problem that the initial information flow
   between a group of agents is required to be preserved for all time in
   order to achieve a given set of system-level objectives. This technical
   note focuses on a new connectivity control architecture for networked
   multiagent systems based on hybrid protocols. Specifically, for a group
   of agents subject to Delta-disk proximity graphs, we consider the
   consensus problem while preserving connectedness with a priori given
   bounds on the control inputs. The bounds on the control inputs are shown
   neither to depend on potential functions nor system states. Instead the
   bounds are user selected continuous functions. Using the proposed
   framework, we show that the maximum distance among neighboring agents
   strictly decreases, and hence, the connectivity problem is solved while
   satisfying the consensus objective. Illustrative numerical examples are
   provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed bounded hybrid
   connectivity control architecture.}},

Abstract = {{An Si spin interconnect for all-spin logic (ASL) is analyzed by a
   comprehensive physical model, including spin injection, spin transport,
   and stochastic magnetization dynamics. It is shown that the spin current
   density and spin polarization of the current can be improved by changing

   Furthermore, with the help of an electric field, spin information can
   preserve and propagate between magnets in a highly doped
   micrometer-scale Si channel. Different from metallic ASL, instead of the
   short spin relaxation length, the main constraint of an Si spin
   interconnect is the high bias voltage required to minimize the
   energy-delay product (EDP). The minimum EDP and corresponding bias
   voltage can be reduced significantly by downscaling the nanomagnet. This
   improvement in the magnetic response allows Si to provide a compatible

Abstract = {{We present two decomposition algorithms for single product deep-sea
   maritime inventory routing problems (MIRPs) that possess a core
   substructure common in many real-world applications. The problem
   involves routing vessels, each belonging to a particular vessel class,
   between loading and discharging ports, each belonging to a particular
   region. Our algorithms iteratively solve a MIRP by zooming out and then
   zooming in on the problem. Specifically, in the ``zoomed out{''} phase,
   we solve a first-stage master problem in which aggregate information
   about regions and vessel classes is used to route vessels between
   regions, while only implicitly considering inventory and capacity
   requirements, berth limits, and other side constraints. In the ``zoomed
   in{''} phase, we solve a series of second-stage subproblems, one for
   each region, in which individual vessels are routed through each region
   and load and discharge quantities are determined. Computational
   experience shows that an integrated approach that combines these two
   algorithms is vastly superior to solving the problem directly with a
   commercial mixed-integer programming solver.}},

Title = {{Framework for Work-Space Planning Using Four-Dimensional BIM in
   Construction Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Each participant in a building construction project requires a dedicated
   work space in which to execute their activities. In this environment,
   inappropriate work-space planning in a construction site causes
   work-space problems, which results in a loss of productivity, safety
   hazards, and issues of poor quality. Therefore, the work space should be
   considered one of the most important resources and constraints to manage
   at a construction site. However, current construction planning
   techniques have proven to be insufficient for work-space planning
   because they do not account for the spatial feature of each activity. To
   establish a formalized work-space planning process, therefore, this
   paper categorizes work space by its function and movability and suggests
   a framework for a work-space planning process that contains five phases,
   including 4D building information model (BIM) generation, work-space
   requirement identification, work-space occupation representation,
   work-space problem identification, and work-space problem resolution.
   The proposed framework in this paper can improve the accuracy of
   work-space status representation and work-space problem identification
   by introducing the work-space occupation concept and the integrated
   work-space planning process that considers characteristics of activity,
   work space, and construction plan. In addition, this paper aims to
   ameliorate the work-space planning process through path analysis and a
   formalized work-space problem resolution process. To validate the
   proposed approach, a case project was tested. The result shows the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework on improving the
   work-space planning process. Based on the result of this study, a
   project manager will be able to prevent possible work-space problems and
   their negative effects on project performance by devising a pertinent
   work-space plan during the preconstruction phase. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Technologies to harvest electrical energy from wind have vast potentials
   because wind is one of the cleanest and most sustainable energy sources
   that nature provides. Here we propose a flutter-driven triboelectric
   generator that uses contact electrification caused by the self-sustained
   oscillation of flags. We study the coupled interaction between a
   fluttering flexible flag and a rigid plate. In doing so, we find three
   distinct contact modes: single, double and chaotic. The flutter-driven
   triboelectric generator having small dimensions of 7.5 x 5cm at wind
   speed of 15 ms(-1) exhibits high-electrical performances: an
   instantaneous output voltage of 200V and a current of 60 mu A with a
   high frequency of 158 Hz, giving an average power density of
   approximately 0.86mW. The flutter-driven triboelectric generation is a
   promising technology to drive electric devices in the outdoor
   environments in a sustainable manner.}},

Abstract = {{Rotating blades on helicopters experience reverse flow under high
   advance ratio conditions. Here, reverse flow is characterized by the
   flow traveling from the sharp trailing edge to the blunt leading edge.
   Uncertainty in the blade aerodynamic loads under these conditions has
   been a limitation during the design of high-speed rotorcraft. In this
   work, we hypothesize that the reverse flow over a yawed blade includes
   phenomena similar to the formation of a leading edge vortex on
   sharp-edged delta wings. Low-speed wind tunnel experiments are reported
   on a scaled version of a rotor blade in regular and reverse flow over a
   large range of yaw and moderate ranges of angle of attack. Force
   measurements indicate a deviation from yawed-wing expectations at high
   yaw angles. Surface flow visualization via tufts shows the existence of
   an attached span-wise vortex on the wing.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of Au tetrahedra in high purity and with
   tunable, well-controlled sizes via seed-mediated growth. The success of
   this synthesis relies on the use of single-crystal, spherical Au
   nanocrystals as the seeds and manipulation of the reaction kinetics to
   induce an unsymmetrical growth pattern for the seeds. In particular, the
   dropwise addition of a precursor solution with a syringe pump, assisted
   by cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and bromide at appropriate
   concentrations, was found to be critical to the formation of Au
   tetrahedra in high purity. Their sizes could be readily tuned in the
   range of 30-60 nm by simply varying the amount of precursor added to the
   reaction solution. The current strategy not only enables the synthesis
   of Au tetrahedra with tunable and controlled sizes but also provides a
   facile and versatile approach to reducing the symmetry of nanocrystals
   made of a face-centered cubic lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Several engineering systems, such as aircraft structures, are composed
   of load-bearing thin plates that undergo vibrations and employ wireless
   health, usage, and condition monitoring components, which can be made
   self-powered using vibrational energy harvesting technologies.
   Integrated piezoelectric patches can be implemented for enabling
   self-powered sensors in the neighborhood of plate-based structures. In
   this work, coupled electroelastic modeling and experimental validations
   of broadband energy harvesting from structurally integrated
   piezoelectric patches on a rectangular thin plate are presented. A
   distributed-parameter electroelastic model for multiple patch-based
   energy harvesters attached on a thin plate is developed. Closed-form
   structural and electrical response expressions are derived for multiple
   vibration modes of a fully clamped thin plate for the series and
   parallel connection configurations of multiple patch-based energy
   harvesters. Experimental and analytical case studies are then compared
   for validating the analytical models of structurally integrated multiple
   patch-based energy harvesters. It is shown that analytical
   electroelastic frequency response functions exhibit very good agreement
   with the experimental frequency response function measurements for the
   series and parallel connection cases. In addition to offering an
   effective interface for energy harvesting from two-dimensional thin
   structures, series and parallel multiple patch-based energy harvester
   configurations yield effective broadband energy harvesting by combining
   the electrical outputs of harvester patches for multiple vibration
   modes.}},

Abstract = {{The use of energy harvesting to provide power to low-power electronic
   devices has the potential to create autonomous, self-powered
   electronics. This article presents the investigation of a novel material
   for vibration-based energy harvesting. Piezoelectret foam, a lead-free,
   polymer-based electret material exhibiting piezoelectric-like
   properties, is investigated for low-power energy generation. An overview
   of the fabrication and operation of piezoelectret foams is first given.
   Mechanical testing is then performed, where anisotropy in the principal
   length directions is found along with Young's moduli between 0.5 and 1
   GPa and tensile strengths from 35 to 70 MPa. Dynamic electromechanical
   characterization is performed in order to measure the piezoelectric
   d(33) coefficient of the foam over a wide frequency range. The d33
   coefficient is found to be relatively constant at around 175 pC/N from
   10 Hz to 1 kHz. Finally, the foam is evaluated as an energy harvesting
   material by first developing an electromechanical model to predict the
   voltage response during excitation, then performing dynamic
   experimentation to measure the voltage frequency response with
   comparisons to modeling predictions for a set of electrical loads, and
   finally conducting energy harvesting experimentation in which the foam
   is used to charge a capacitor. Harmonic excitation of a pre-tensioned
   15.2 cm x 15.2 cm sample at 60 Hz and displacement of +/- 73 mu m yields
   an average power of 6.0 mu W delivered to a 1 mF storage capacitor. The
   capacitor is charged to 4.67 V in 30 min, proving the ability of
   piezoelectret foam to supply power to small electronic components.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables comprehensive scans of
   entire transcriptomes, but best practices for analyzing RNA-seq data
   have not been fully defined, particularly for data collected with
   multiple sequencing platforms or at multiple sites. Here we used
   standardized RNA samples with built-in controls to examine sources of
   error in large-scale RNA-seq studies and their impact on the detection
   of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Analysis of variations in
   guanine-cytosine content, gene coverage, sequencing error rate and
   insert size allowed identification of decreased reproducibility across
   sites. Moreover, commonly used methods for normalization (cqn, EDASeq,
   RUV2, sva, PEER) varied in their ability to remove these systematic
   biases, depending on sample complexity and initial data quality.
   Normalization methods that combine data from genes across sites are
   strongly recommended to identify and remove site-specific effects and
   can substantially improve RNA-seq studies.}},

Abstract = {{We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC)
   project, coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Examining
   Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at
   multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in
   controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for junction
   discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to
   microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics.
   At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions,
   with >80\% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative
   expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if
   specific-filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not
   provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are
   observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement
   performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and
   variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC
   data sets, comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique
   resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) greatly expands the potential
   for genomics discoveries, but the wide variety of platforms, protocols
   and performance capabilitites has created the need for comprehensive
   reference data. Here we describe the Association of Biomolecular
   Resource Facilities next-generation sequencing (ABRF-NGS) study on
   RNA-seq. We carried out replicate experiments across 15 laboratory sites
   using reference RNA standards to test four protocols (poly-A-selected,
   ribo-depleted, size-selected and degraded) on five sequencing platforms
   (Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies PGM and Proton, Pacific Biosciences
   RS and Roche 454). The results show high intraplatform (Spearman rank R
   > 0.86) and inter-platform (R > 0.83) concordance for expression
   measures across the deep-count platforms, but highly variable efficiency
   and cost for splice junction and variant detection between all
   platforms. For intact RNA, gene expression profiles from rRNA-depletion
   and poly-A enrichment are similar. In addition, rRNA depletion enables
   effective analysis of degraded RNA samples. This study provides a broad
   foundation for cross-platform standardization, evaluation and
   improvement of RNA-seq.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel Microgrid (MG) planning methodology to
   decide optimal locations, sizes and mix of dispatchable and intermittent
   distributed generators (DGs). The long-term costs in the proposed
   planning model include investment, operation and maintenance (O\&M),
   fuel and emission costs of DGs while the revenue includes payment by MG
   loads and utility grid. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer
   program (MIP) considering the probabilistic nature of DG outputs and
   load consumption, wherein the costs are minimized and profits are
   maximized. The model is transformed to be a two-stage robust
   optimization problem. A column and constraint generation (CCG) framework
   is used to solve the problem. Compared with conventional MG planning
   approaches, the proposed model is more practical in that it fully
   considers the system uncertainties and only requires a deterministic
   uncertainty set, rather than a probability distribution of uncertain
   data which is difficult to obtain. Case studies of a MG with wind
   turbines, photovoltaic generators (PVs) and microturbines (MTs)
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based voltage/var

   optimal tap positions of on-load tap changer and switch statuses of

   used constant-power load model, the exponential load model is used to
   capture the various load behaviors in this paper. Different customer
   types such as industrial, residential, and commercial loads are also
   considered. The uncertainties of model prediction errors are taken into
   account in the proposed model. A scenario reduction technique is applied
   to enhance a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the
   computational burden. The MPC-based VVO problem is formulated as a
   mixed-integer nonlinear program with reduced scenarios. Case studies
   show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D geometrical propagation model that includes both stationary and

   3-D parametric reference model for narrow-band MIMO V-to-V multipath
   fading channels is developed. From the reference model, the
   corresponding space-time correlation function (ST-CF) and space-Doppler
   power spectral density (SD-PSD) are derived for a 3-D nonisotropic
   scattering environment. Finally, the theoretical results are compared
   with measured data in an urban surface street and Interstate highway
   road surfaces. The close agreement between the analytically and
   empirically obtained channel statistics confirms the utility of the

Abstract = {{Although adaptive control theory offers mathematical tools to achieve
   required system performance without excessive dependence on modeling,
   its application to safety-critical systems can be limited by the
   presence of unmodeled dynamics. This paper examines the robustness to
   unmodeled dynamics of a recently developed derivative-free adaptive
   control law. In contrast to derivative-based adaptive laws, it is shown,
   using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, that robustness to unmodeled
   dynamics is improved by increasing the adaptation gain. This is
   accomplished by including a bias term in the set of basis functions
   employed by the adaptive control law. It is shown that derivative-based
   adaptive laws do not offer the same advantage. Examples are presented
   that compare these two forms of adaptation in the context of sensitivity
   to unmodeled dynamics.}},

   arrays thus present a ``plasmonic library{''} of locally noncoupling
   plasmonic particles of different sizes, which can serve as a platform
   for future combinatorial screening of size effects. The structures were
   prepared by substrate assembly of
   gold-core/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-shell particles and subsequent
   post-modification. Coupling of the localized surface plasmon resonance
   (LSPR) could be avoided since the polymer shell separates the
   encapsulated gold cores. To produce a particle array with a broad range
   of well-defined but laterally distinguishable particle sizes, the
   substrate was dip-coated in a growth solution, which resulted in an
   overgrowth of the gold cores controlled by the local exposure time. The
   kinetics was quantitatively analyzed and found to be diffusion rate
   controlled, allowing for precise tuning of particle size by adjusting
   the withdrawal speed. We determined the kinetics of the overgrowth
   process, investigated the LSPRs along the gradient by UV-vis extinction
   spectroscopy, and compared the spectroscopic results to the predictions
   from Mie theory, indicating the absence of local interparticle coupling.
   We finally discuss potential applications of these substrate-supported
   plasmonic particle libraries and perspectives toward extending the
   concept from size to composition variation and screening of plasmonic
   coupling effects.}},

Abstract = {{Excitation of surface plasmon polaritons helps to increase the
   near-field heat flux by orders of magnitude beyond the limit governed by
   Stefan-Boltzmann law. However, the photon tunneling probability is
   rather low, except for modes satisfying the resonance condition of
   surface plasmon polaritons. Broadband hyperbolic metamaterials can
   broaden the frequency region for the enhancement of near-field heat
   transfer, but can hardly maintain a high tunneling probability for large
   wavevectors since no resonances are excited to overcome the inherent
   exponential decay. In this letter, perfect photon tunneling with
   near-unity probability across broad frequency and k-space region is
   demonstrated based on the hybridization of graphene plasmons and
   hyperbolic modes. As a result, the near-field heat transfer coefficient
   between doped-silicon-nanowire hyperbolic metamaterials can be further
   improved several fold when covered by a graphene sheet, approaching to a
   theoretical limit.}},

   dose levels needed to support multi-Mrad exploration missions such as

   extreme total dose. The nFETs exhibit significantly reduced shallow

   BiCMOS processes. Both nFETs and pFETs show negligible transconductance

Abstract = {{This paper investigates iterative channel estimation (ICE) for

   antennas. To improve performance of channel estimation, we exploit the
   soft information of unknown data symbols on both the expected transmit
   antenna and the interfering transmit antenna. Maximum a posteriori
   (MAP)-based ICE is derived and is implemented using the fixed-point
   iteration (FPI). For an OFDM system with multiple transmit antennas, the
   proposed MAP-based ICE suggests a harmonic-average-based soft symbol on
   the expected transmit antenna while an arithmetic-average-based soft
   symbol on the interfering transmit antennas. Similar to an OFDM system
   with a single transmit antenna, MAP-based ICE can achieve the Cramer-Rao
   bound (CRB) within only one iteration, when the signal-to-noise ratio

Abstract = {{The majority of land use-travel behaviour studies only considers the
   direct influence of spatial characteristics on daily travel behaviour.
   However, this framework should be expanded. A first step is to explore
   the complex interdependencies of long-term lifestyle decisions,
   medium-term decisions about residential location and car ownership, and
   the underlying residential and travel attitudes. Travel behaviour should
   be considered within a hierarchy of decisions while considering the
   motivational background of these decisions. Using data from an Internet
   survey completed by +1800 respondents in Flanders, Belgium, this paper
   defines car ownership somewhat more broadly as car availability. Results
   of a structural equation model indicate a significant direct effect of
   the residential neighbourhood on car availability. However, effects are
   small compared to the influence of other variables such as stage of life
   and travel (mode) attitude, the latter referring to travel-related
   selfselection. Moreover, one should keep in mind that residential
   attitudes remain important in the initial selection of the residential
   neighbourhood and its spatial characteristics, indicating the need to
   control for residential self-selection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Validating ENSO Teleconnections on Southeastern US Winter Hydrology}},
Journal = {{EARTH INTERACTIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the authors contrast four century-long meteorological
   datasets comprising of two sets of observations {[}Climate Research Unit
   (CRU) and Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model
   (PRISM)] and two atmospheric reanalyses {[}Twentieth Century Reanalysis
   (20CR) and Florida Climate Institute-Florida State University
   Land-Atmosphere Regional Reanalysis version 1.0 (FLAReS1.0)] to diagnose
   the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forced variations on the
   streamflow in 28 watersheds spread across the southeastern United States
   (SEUS). The datasets are used to force three different lumped
   (calibrated) hydrological models with precipitation from these four
   sources of century-long datasets separately to obtain the median
   prediction from 1800 (=3 models x 600 simulations per model per
   watershed per season) multimodel estimates of seasonal mean streamflow
   across the 28 watersheds in the SEUS for each winter season from 1906 to
   2005. The authors then compare and contrast the mean streamflow and its
   variability estimates from all three of the century-long climate
   forcings. The multimodel strategy of simulating the seasonal mean
   streamflow is to reduce the hydrological model uncertainty. The authors
   focus on the boreal winter season when ENSO influence on the SEUS
   climate variations is well known.
   The authors find that the atmospheric reanalysis over the SEUS is able
   to reasonably capture the ENSO teleconnections as depicted in the CRU
   and PRISM precipitation datasets. Even the observed decadal modulation
   of this teleconnection by Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is
   broadly captured. The streamflow in the 28 watersheds also show similar
   consistency across the four datasets in that the positive correlations
   of the boreal winter Nino-3.4 SST anomalies with corresponding anomalies
   of streamflow, the associated shift in the probability density function
   of the streamflow with the change in phase of ENSO, and the decadal
   modulation of the ENSO teleconnection by the AMO are sustained in the
   streamflow simulations forced by all four climate datasets (CRU, PRISM,
   20CR, and FLAReS1.0). However, the ENSO signal in the streamflow is
   consistently much stronger in the southern watersheds (over Florida) of
   the SEUS across all four climate datasets. During the negative phase of
   the AMO, however, there is a clear shift of the ENSO teleconnections
   with streamflow, with winter streamflows in northern watersheds (over
   the Carolinas) exhibiting much stronger correlations with the ENSO
   Nino-3.4 index relative to the southern watersheds of the SEUS. This
   study clearly indicates that the proposed methodology using FLAReS1.0
   serves as a viable alternative to reconstruct twentieth-century SEUS
   seasonal winter hydrology that captures the interannual variations of
   ENSO and associated decadal variations forced by the AMO. However, it is
   found that the FLAReS1.0 forced streamflow is far from adequate in
   simulating the streamflow dynamics of the watershed over the SEUS at a
   daily time scale.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method for tracking structures (e.g., ventricles and
   myocardium) in cardiac images (e.g., magnetic resonance) by propagating
   forward in time a previous estimate of the structures using a new
   physically motivated motion estimation scheme. Our method estimates
   motion by regularizing only within structures so that differing motions
   among different structures are not mixed. It simultaneously satisfies
   the physical constraints at the interface between a fluid and a medium
   that the normal component of the fluid's motion must match the normal
   component of the medium's motion and the No-Slip condition, which states
   that the tangential velocity approaches zero near the interface. We show
   that these conditions lead to partial differential equations with Robin
   boundary conditions at the interface, which couple the motion between
   structures. We show that propagating a segmentation across frames using
   our motion estimation scheme leads to more accurate segmentation than
   traditional motion estimation that does not use physical constraints.
   Our method is suited to interactive segmentation, prominently used in
   commercial applications for cardiac analysis, where segmentation
   propagation is used to predict a segmentation in the next frame. We show
   that our method leads to more accurate predictions than a popular and
   recent interactive method used in cardiac segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{A new inventory model that considers both cost and emission functions is
   proposed for environments where temperature-controlled items need to be
   stored at a certain, non-ambient temperature and to do so modular
   temperature-control units are used. Transportation unit capacity and
   storage unit capacity are considered, which results in non-linear,
   non-continuous cost and emissions functions. A set of exact algorithms
   are developed to find the optimal order quantity based on cost and
   emission function minimization, and the mathematical proof of the
   optimality of the solutions are presented. Using a variety of parameter
   ratios, a set of experiments are run to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed model compared to the current models in the literature and to
   provide managerial insights into the cold item inventory problem.
   Optimum order quantity for cost function optimization and emission
   function optimization are compared against each other and the tradeoff

   Capable of Heterotrophic Nitrification-Aerobic Denitrification}},

Abstract = {{The simultaneous removal of phenol and ammonium using heterotrophic
   nitrifying-denitrifying bacterium Serratia sp. LJ(-1) was investigated.
   The maximum removal rates of ammonium nitrogen and phenol were 1.08 +/-
   0.05 and 2.14 +/- 0.08 mg L-1 h(-1), respectively. The ammonium
   oxidation had much higher tolerance to phenol toxicity than that of the
   autotrophic nitrifying bacteria. The increase in phenol concentration
   led to an increase in ammonium oxidation rate under the phenol
   concentration of 600 mg L-1. The increase in ammonium concentration
   caused an increase in phenol biodegradation rate under the ammonium
   nitrogen concentration of 150 mg L-1. Maximum rates of phenol
   biodegradation and total nitrogen removal in the treatments with
   nitrification metabolite (nitrate or nitrite) as the sole nitrogen
   source were more than 30 \% lower than those of the treatment with
   ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. Ammonium was removed through
   nitrification and subsequent aerobic denitrification while phenol was
   biodegraded through the ortho-cleavage pathway and subsequently
   mineralized. Since phenol often coexists with nitrogen pollutants, these
   findings have significant environmental implications in terms of the
   simultaneous removal of these contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate predictions of the aeroelastic response of a rotorcraft are
   essential to minimize weight and estimate the fatigue life of
   rotary-wing aircraft components. Aeroelastic analyses are characterized
   by strong couplings between the aerodynamic loads and the structural
   response and are very time-consuming, in particular when
   computational-fluid-dynamics predictions of airloads are coupled with
   computational-structural-dynamics models. Simple aerodynamic models do
   not predict the response of the system with sufficient accuracy. A novel
   combined numerical and experimental algorithm, the load confluence
   algorithm, is developed to iteratively correct the numerical model of
   the external loads from minimal experimental data to best represent the
   experimental response. Aerodynamic loads are modeled with a simple
   approach, such as the lifting-line theory. The proposed algorithm uses
   the measured strains as inputs to a strain mapping algorithm, which then
   predicts force and moment corrections using a modal approach. These
   corrections are added to the lifting-line forces and moments to obtain a
   close correlation between measured and computed strains. This paper
   analyzes the influence of user-defined parameters on the convergence of
   the proposed approach. Results for three different steady forward-flight
   conditions of the UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter demonstrate the ability
   of the algorithm to accurately predict the flapwise, edgewise, and
   torsional internal moments along the blade with an accuracy that is
   comparable with detailed computational-fluid-dynamics analyses with a
   much reduced computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{Image blurring is a problem encountered when pressure-sensitive paint is
   applied to rotating surfaces such as rotorcraft blades. The issue is
   particularly problematic near the leading and trailing edges of the
   blade; these are the regions where the impact of blurring is the most
   significant, yet they also contain the most valuable pressure
   information. Recent work has developed image-deblurring techniques based
   on deconvolution of the image with a point-spread function based on the
   known lifetime decay of pressure-sensitive paint and the rotation speed
   of the blade. This deblurring technique is effective in recovering
   information at the blade edges when the amount of blurring is not too
   high. However, the existing deblurring algorithm assumes rectilinear
   motion and uniform distribution of luminophore lifetime (i.e., constant
   pressure distribution). The objective of this work is to relax the
   rectilinear assumption by allowing for rotational blur and to assess the
   impact of strong pressure gradients on the resulting deblurred pressure
   distribution. The new deblurring scheme is evaluated by experiments on a
   spinning disk with a known pressure field and a corotating, grazing
   nitrogen jet. The sensitivity of the deblurred results to various input
   parameters is evaluated, and recommendations for further algorithm
   development are provided.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, grass, agricultural, and forest
   residues, are potential resources for the production of bioethanol. The
   current biochemical process of converting biomass to bioethanol
   typically consists of three main steps: pretreatment, enzymatic
   hydrolysis, and fermentation. For this process, pretreatment is probably
   the most crucial step since it has a large impact on the efficiency of
   the overall bioconversion. The aim of pretreatment is to disrupt
   recalcitrant structures of cellulosic biomass to make cellulose more
   accessible to the enzymes that convert carbohydrate polymers into
   fermentable sugars. This paper reviews several leading acidic, neutral,
   and alkaline pretreatments technologies. Different pretreatment methods,
   including dilute acid pretreatment (DAP), steam explosion pretreatment
   (SEP), organosolv, liquid hot water (LHW), ammonia fiber expansion
   (AFEX), soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA), sodium hydroxide/lime
   pretreatments, and ozonolysis are intensively introduced and discussed.
   In this minireview, the key points are focused on the structural changes
   primarily in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin during the above
   leading pretreatment technologies.}},

Abstract = {{A set of agricultural suppliers with low demands can save on long-haul

   economies of scale by aiming to ship larger quantities. We
   experimentally compare the heuristic's performance against other simple
   policies, a rolling horizon algorithm, and a stochastic dynamic
   programming model. Our numerical results demonstrate that the heuristic
   provides solutions that are near the lower bound provided by the dynamic
   programming model, and that the benefits of consolidating depend on the
   size of the suppliers' demand. We also propose a proportional cost
   allocation rule that encourages the suppliers to cooperate with each

Title = {{Cryogenic thermal system analysis for orbital propellant depot}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{35-46}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{In any manned mission architecture, upwards of seventy percent of all
   payload delivered to orbit is propellant, and propellant mass fraction
   dominates almost all transportation segments of any mission requiring a
   heavy lift launch system like the Saturn V. To mitigate this, the use of
   an orbital propellant depot has been extensively studied. In this paper,
   a thermal model of an orbital propellant depot is used to examine the
   effects of passive and active thermal management strategies. Results
   show that an all passive thermal management strategy results in
   significant boil-off for both hydrogen and oxygen. At current launch
   vehicle prices, these boil-offs equate to millions of dollars lost per
   month. Zero boil-off of propellant is achievable with the use of active
   cryocoolers; however, the cooling power required to produce
   zero-boil-off is an order of magnitude higher than current
   state-of-the-art cryocoolers. This study shows a zero-boil-off
   cryocooler minimum power requirement of 80-100 W at 80 K for liquid
   oxygen, and 100-120 W at 20 K for liquid hydrogen for a representative
   Near-Earth Object mission. Research and development effort is required
   to improve the state-of-the-arts in-space cryogenic thermal management.

Journal = {{BRACHYTHERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively observe and
   analyze the long-term treatment outcomes for a total of 952 esophageal
   cancer patients who were treated with Cf-252 neutron brachytherapy (NBT)
   in combination with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: From November 2001 to March 2012, 952 patients
   with esophageal cancer underwent NBT in combination with EBRT. The
   patient numbers distributed over various cancer Stages I, HA, JIB, III,
   and IVA were 9, 290, 51, 579, and 23, respectively. The total radiation
   dose to the reference point via NBT was 8-25 Gy-eq in three to five
   fractions with one fraction/week. The total dose via EBRT was 40-60 Gy
   delivered over a period of 5-6 weeks with normal fractionation.
   RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 20.3 months. The 1-, 3-,
   and 5-year survival rates were 67.1\%, 36.3\%, and 26.6\%, respectively.
   These results compare favorably with the results obtained from
   conventional high-dose rate in combinatioh with EBRT. Although a
   majority of the patients (860 or 90.3\%) developed Grades 1 and 2
   esophagitis during treatment, the symptoms were effectively relieved
   after the application of antacid and surface anesthesia.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical data show that NBT in combination with EBRT
   produced favorable local control and long-term survival rates for
   patients with esophageal cancer and that the side effects are tolerable.
   As such, we conclude that this dual-modality method is an effective and
   safe way for treating esophageal cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {{Background: Because ambient air pollution exposure occurs as mixtures,
   consideration of joint effects of multiple pollutants may advance our
   understanding of the health effects of air pollution.
   Methods: We assessed the joint effect of air pollutants on pediatric
   asthma emergency department visits in Atlanta during 1998-2004. We
   selected combinations of pollutants that were representative of oxidant
   gases and secondary, traffic, power plant, and criteria pollutants,
   constructed using combinations of criteria pollutants and fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5) components. Joint effects were assessed using
   multipollutant Poisson generalized linear models controlling for time
   trends, meteorology, and daily nonasthma upper respiratory emergency
   department visit counts. Rate ratios (RRs) were calculated for the
   combined effect of an interquartile range increment in each pollutant's
   concentration.
   Results: Increases in all of the selected pollutant combinations were
   associated with increases in warm-season pediatric asthma emergency
   department visits (eg, joint-effect RR = 1.13 {[}95\% confidence
   interval = 1.06-1.21] for criteria pollutants, including ozone, carbon
   monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and PM2.5). Cold-season
   joint effects from models without nonlinear effects were generally
   weaker than warm-season effects. Joint-effect estimates from
   multipollutant models were often smaller than estimates based on
   single-pollutant models, due to control for confounding. Compared with
   models without interactions, joint-effect estimates from models
   including first-order pollutant interactions were largely similar. There
   was evidence of nonlinear cold-season effects.
   Conclusions: Our analyses illustrate how consideration of joint effects
   can add to our understanding of health effects of multipollutant
   exposures and also illustrate some of the complexities involved in
   calculating and interpreting joint effects of multiple pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a time-varying stochastic technique to assess
   conservation voltage reduction (CVR) effects based on load modeling. A
   time-varying exponential load model is developed to represent voltage
   dependences of loads. The recursive least square (RLS) method is applied
   to identify model parameters in a recursive way. CVR factors can be
   calculated using the identified model parameters. The time-varying
   stochastic model for CVR effects can then be constructed by the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. The proposed CVR assessment method is
   applied to one-year measurement data from a utility company. The
   calculated CVR factors are verified by a Euclidian distance-based
   comparison method. Stochastic models of CVR effects in each time window
   are constructed. Compared with previous efforts on assessing CVR
   effects, the proposed method does not require control groups or
   assumptions of linear relationships between the load and its impact
   factors. The probabilistic nature of CVR effects is also fully
   considered.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BANKING \& FINANCE}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the Basel II capital ratio, Basel III requires banks to
   respect additional ratios, such as leverage ratio, liquidity coverage
   ratio and net stable funding ratio. Banks are required to be compliant
   with all four constraints simultaneously. Our article provides a
   framework for banks to help their search for an optimal transition from
   Basel II to Basel III. Recognizing that banks' return and the four
   constraints are of linear type, this search can be formulated as a
   linear program and solved by standard software. Incorporating
   uncertainty on future defaults, risk weights and withdrawals and
   formulating the problem as a Chance constrained model does not only
   yield optimal transition strategies but also determines the internal
   thresholds for the Basel III-ratios. Our approach needs two standard
   inputs from controlling: profit margins per product and non-financial
   adjustment costs to expand or cut back business. The adjustment cost can
   be used to calibrate the model to the current business mix. This
   calibration can be done by bank outsiders and allows the model to be
   used in impact studies to replace ad hoc strategies. To highlight its
   practicality, we apply our model to a typical German bank with a
   business mix that complies with Basel II, but not with the Basel III-,
   capital-, leverage- and net stable funding-ratio. Assuming that its
   business model is optimal under Basel II, we find that this bank would
   achieve compliance restructuring its funding side by replacing interbank
   funding by capital and retail deposits. Additional uncertainty would
   amplify the magnitude of the changes, but would still affect the same
   positions. These findings are robust against alternative margin
   definitions and adjustment cost levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents the new power dissipation model of individual
   switching device in a high-level modular multilevel converter (MMC),
   which can be mostly used in voltage sourced converter (VSC) based
   high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system and flexible AC transmission
   system (FACTS). Also, the voltage balancing method based on sorting
   algorithm is newly proposed to advance the M MC functionalities by
   effectively adjusting switching variations of the sub-module (SM). The
   proposed power dissipation model does not fully calculate the average
   power dissipation for numerous switching devices in an arm module.
   Instead, it estimates the power dissipation of every switching element
   based on the inherent operational principle of SM in MMC. In other
   words, the power dissipation is computed in every single switching event
   by using the polynomial curve fitting model with minimum computational
   efforts and high accuracy, which are required to manage the large number
   of SMs. After estimating the value of power dissipation, the thermal
   condition of every switching element is considered in the case of
   external disturbance. Then, the arm modeling for high-level MMC and its
   control scheme is implemented with the electromagnetic transient
   simulation program. Finally, the case study for applying to the MMC
   based HVDC system is carried out to select the appropriate
   insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module in a steady-state, as
   well as to estimate the proper thermal condition of every switching
   element in a transient state.}},

Abstract = {{It is essential for electronics reliability to develop effective
   methodologies to detect hidden solder joint defects. Active infrared
   thermography is an alternative to X-ray detection methodologies. The
   limits of active infrared thermography to detect solder ball defects on
   plastic ball grid arrays (PBGA) components (missing, open, cracked, and
   head on pillow defects) are investigated here. A FEM was used to
   simulate the thermal phenomena during the infrared thermography
   inspection of a PBGA component. The FEM was proven to be temporal and
   spatial grids size independent. The average temperature difference
   (Delta T) amid regions with and without defects was used as a
   detectability indicator. Defects detectability was found to decrease as
   the number of blocking objects increases. Missing solder balls were
   barely detected when blocked by the substrate and moulding compound with
   detectability numbers close to 1 degrees C. Head on pillow and cracked
   defects were impossible to detect with a maximum Delta T - 0.6 degrees
   C. Open solder balls were not detected below two objects with a maximum
   Delta T = 0.3 degrees C. These results clearly suggest that infrared
   thermography can be effectively used to detect hidden missing and open
   solder ball defects on PBGA components composed by a substrate and a
   die.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic packaged devices are becoming increasingly smaller in size
   and higher in density while requiring higher performance and superior
   reliability. Warpage is one of the crucial factors for the
   thermomechanical reliability of electronic packages and warpage control
   becomes a more crucial process during the printed wiring board (PWB)
   fabrication and package assembly processes. This requirement
   necessitates more accurate methods of measuring warpage. The fringe
   projection methods are recent trends for measuring the warpage of chip
   packages, PWBs, and PWB assemblies (PWBAs) because of their noncontact,
   full-field, and high-resolution measurement capabilities. This paper
   presents a comparison of two fringe projection methods: laser fringe
   projection (LFP) (projection moire) and digital fringe projection (DFP).
   Experimental results show that digital fringe projection has higher
   practical resolution, and better accuracy and precision than laser
   fringe projection.}},

Abstract = {{Power dissipated by modern microprocessors is a function of time and
   continuously changes with the workload, giving rise to temporal hotspots
   of local areas with very high power dissipation. A hybrid cooling scheme
   has been proposed, which combines solid-state cooling to remove the
   dynamically changing hotspots in real time while addressing the
   steady-state background power dissipation using liquid cooling in
   embedded microchannels. In this paper, we have investigated the
   transient behavior of the hybrid scheme through experiments as well as
   computational modeling. Infrared microscopy, equipped with transient
   detector, was used to study the transient cooling behavior when a power
   spike is produced by a microfabricated heater, emulating a hot spot. The
   results indicate that solid-state superlattice cooling (SLC) offers an
   extremely fast transient response, having time constant of the order of
   few tens of microseconds which matches with dynamics of microprocessor
   power dissipation. The effect of various geometric and operating
   conditions on the transient behavior of the hybrid scheme has been
   assessed to provide an insight and guidelines for optimal design and
   operation of the proposed hybrid cooling scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Prosthetic heart valves have been widely used to replace diseased or
   defective native heart valves. Flow through bileaflet mechanical heart
   valves (BMHVs) have previously demonstrated complex phenomena in the
   vicinity of the valve owing to the presence of two rigid leaflets. This
   study aims to accurately capture the complex flow dynamics for pulsatile
   flow through a 23 mm St Jude Medical (SJM) Regent (TM) BMHV. The
   lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to simulate pulsatile flow
   through the valve with the inclusion of reverse leakage flow at very
   high spatiotemporal resolution that can capture fine details in the
   pulsatile BMHV flow field. For higher-Reynolds-number flows, this high
   spatiotemporal resolution captures features that have not been observed
   in previous coarse resolution studies. In addition, the simulations are
   able to capture with detail the features of leaflet closing and the
   asymmetric b-datum leakage jet during mid-diastole. Novel flow physics
   are visualized and discussed along with quantification of turbulent
   features of this flow, which is made possible by this parallelized
   numerical method.}},

   Fly Ash Slurry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recent stability issues in ash ponds have highlighted the importance of
   estimation of in situ void ratio or water content of disposed fly ash to
   assess the field performance and stability of these disposal units. One
   standard prohibits the use of fly ash with carbon content greater than
   6\% in concrete, making low-cost methods of quantifying the carbon
   content of fly ash attractive, especially for applications that might
   consider mining and reuse of previously disposed fly ash. In this study,
   electrical conductivity/resistivity measurements were used to measure
   the in situ carbon content and void ratio of fly ash, with the ultimate
   goal of quantifying the level of unburned carbon in the material.
   Because unburned carbon particles are electrically conductive, the
   resulting media conductivity is a function of carbon content, allowing
   determination of the carbon content of fly ash as well as the void
   ratio, or water content, of the soil matrix. The authors found that the
   measured electrical conductivity generally increased with an increase in
   carbon content, and the dependency of carbon particle conduction on
   applied stress increased with an increase in carbon content owing to the
   increased number of direct contacts between electrically conductive
   unburned carbon particles. In addition, this study evaluated the effect
   of pore-water conductivity on media conductivity and carbon particle
   conduction. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the validity of the local effective medium theory
   (EMT) in predicting the near-field radiative heat transfer between

   fluctuational electrodynamics using the Green's function formulation.
   The cutoff wave vectors for surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and
   hyperbolic modes are evaluated. Combining the Bloch theory with the

Abstract = {{The control of vibrating structures using piezoelectric elements
   attached to simple control circuits, known as shunts, is a widely
   studied field. Many different shunt circuits have been researched that
   have been shown to obtain effective performance in both narrow and
   broadband frequency ranges. Yet, the choice for the exact parameters of
   the circuit elements for these vibration-suppressing shunts can be found
   by various methods. In this study, a new method of selecting the circuit
   parameters of a negative capacitance shunt is presented. The method
   predicts the magnitude of the strain-induced voltage caused by the
   vibrating substrate computed from a single voltage measurement.
   Therefore, minimizing the strain-induced voltage will mean that the
   deflection of the structure is also minimized. The tuning theory is
   confirmed experimentally, which validates that it is possible to
   experimentally obtain the shunt parameters that produce maximum control
   through measurement of the shunt response. The suppression ability of
   the shunt is also compared to the maximum power dissipated. It is found
   that at high frequency, the parameters that cause maximum power
   dissipated obtain maximum suppression, but there is no correlation
   between maximum power dissipated and maximum suppression at low
   frequency.}},

Abstract = {{A facile method for the surface modification of high-voltage and

   In order to prepare polypyrrole (PPy) coating LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2
   material, the facile chemical polymerization method uses Fe(III)
   tosylate as oxidant and ethanol as solvent to avoid the side reaction
   with solvent. TEM depicts that LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 serves as hard
   template and the nanoscale PPy layer grows along the surface of
   LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 during the synthesis process. Because of flocculent
   and nanofiber coating layer, much improved rate performance, high
   temperature cycling, as well as high voltage performance are obtained.
   Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic
   (EIS) results demonstrate that the PPy coating layer effectively
   alleviates the side reactions between liquid electrolytes and
   LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 surface that are highly unstable at high temperature

Abstract = {{In this paper, molecular dynamic simulation was used to study the effect
   of water on the equilibrated structure and mechanical properties of
   cross-linked hydrogel at multiple scales. The hydrogel consisted of
   Polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) as epoxy and the
   Jeffamine, poly-oxy-alkylene-amines, as curing agent. The results for
   systems with various water contents indicated that the cross-links were
   more hydrophilic within the hydrogel structure. Effects of cross-linking
   on the transport properties were also investigated by computing
   diffusion coefficients of water molecules. A new Coarse-Grained (CG)
   scheme for hydrogels is proposed, and validated by comparing the
   transport properties with the all-atom method, demonstrating the
   capability of the model to capture the correct dynamic evolution of the
   system. The all-atom model of the hydrogel was mapped to the CG model
   using the MARTINI force field. This method resulted in a more realistic
   representation of the stiffness of the system, compared to the previous
   experimental studies in the literature. The variation of the stiffness
   of the hydrogel as a function of the water content showed that 40\%
   water content is the optimal value for mechanical performance of the

Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{81-84}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{``Damage{''} in Continuum Mechanics is an internal variable used at the
   scale of a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) to model the decrease
   of stiffness due to the nucleation and propagation of crack tips in the
   bulk. Moreover, irreversible deformation can result from specific
   distributions of crack displacement vectors. This communication presents
   a work in progress on the thermodynamic consistency of Continuum Damage
   Mechanics (CDM) for quasi-brittle materials such as rock or concrete, in
   which ``damage{''} actually lumps two effects: cohesive damage (i.e.
   propagation of crack tips) and adhesive damage (i.e. separation of crack
   faces). It is shown that state-of-the-art CDM models lumping cohesive
   and adhesive damage into the same internal variable are based on
   contradicting thermodynamic assumptions, and that the ambivalent
   definition of damage requires the use of generalized stress variables in
   a CDM framework. Corresponding work-conjugates of damage and
   crack-induced deformation are expressed for a general CDM model. Future
   work will investigate the conditions in which a hyper-elastic framework
   can be used in CDM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The protein structure prediction problem continues to elude scientists.
   Despite the introduction of many method modest gains were made over the
   last decade for certain classes of prediction targets. To address this
   challenge, a social. media based worldwide collaborative effort, named
   WeFold, was undertaken by 13 labs. During the collaboration, the
   laboratories were simultaneously competing with each other. Here, we
   present the first attempt at ``coopetition{''} in scientific research
   applied to the protein structure prediction and refinement problems. The
   coopetition was possible by allowing e participating labs to contribute
   different components of their protein structure prediction pipelines and
   create new hybrid pipelines that they tested during CASP10. This
   manuscript describes both successes and areas needing improvement as
   identified throughout the first WeFold experiment and discusses the
   efforts that are underway to advance this initiative. A footprint of all
   contributions and structures are publicly accessible at
   http://www.wefold.org.}},

Abstract = {{Protein crystallization is dependent upon and sensitive to, the
   interamolecular contacts that assist in ordering proteins into a
   three-dimensional lattice. Here we used protein engineering and
   mutagenesis to affect the crystallization of single chain antibody
   fragments (scFvs) that recognize the EE epitope (EYMPME) with high
   affinity. These hypercrystallizable scFvs are under ones. Guided by
   analyses of intermolecular crystal lattice contacts, two
   second-generation anti-EE scFvs were produced, which from the parent
   scFv framework remained unchanged through the processes of protein with
   installed EE tags. Surprisingly, although noncomplementarity determining
   region (CDR) lattice residues from the parent scFv framework remained
   unchanged through the processes of protein engineering and rational
   design, crystal lattices of the derivative scFvs differ. Comparison of
   energy calculations and the experimentally-determined lattice
   interactions for this basis set provides insight into the complexity of
   the forces driving crystal lattice choice and demonstrates the
   availability of multiple well-ordered surface features in our scFvs
   capable of forming versatile crystal contacts.}},

Title = {{Active origami by 4D printing}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in three dimensional (3D) printing technology that allow
   multiple materials to be printed within each layer enable the creation
   of materials and components with precisely controlled heterogeneous
   microstructures. In addition, active materials, such as shape memory
   polymers, can be printed to create an active microstructure within a
   solid. These active materials can subsequently be activated in a
   controlled manner to change the shape or configuration of the solid in
   response to an environmental stimulus. This has been termed 4D printing,
   with the 4th dimension being the time-dependent shape change after the
   printing. In this paper, we advance the 4D printing concept to the
   design and fabrication of active origami, where a flat sheet
   automatically folds into a complicated 3D component. Here we print
   active composites with shape memory polymer fibers precisely printed in
   an elastomeric matrix and use them as intelligent active hinges to
   enable origami folding patterns. We develop a theoretical model to
   provide guidance in selecting design parameters such as fiber
   dimensions, hinge length, and programming strains and temperature. Using
   the model, we design and fabricate several active origami components
   that assemble from flat polymer sheets, including a box, a pyramid, and
   two origami airplanes. In addition, we directly print a 3D box with
   active composite hinges and program it to assume a temporary flat shape
   that subsequently recovers to the 3D box shape on demand.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Through-process texture evolution was investigated in Fe-2.8 wt.\% Si
   sheets cold-rolled directly from twin-roll cast strip. A strong cube
   texture (\{0 0 1\}(1 0 0)) is successfully developed after
   high-temperature annealing. According to micro-texture analysis, the
   enhanced cube texture is primarily the result of the frequency advantage
   of cube recrystallized grains, especially in large grain size ranges,
   suggesting the dominant role of the oriented nucleation mechanism. Two
   main types of nucleation sites for cube grains are identified: cube
   deformation bands in the interior and near the grain boundary of lambda
   (from \{0 0 1\} (2 1 0) to \{1 1 4\} (8 4 1)-\{1 1 3\} (6 3 1)) deformed
   regions, and shear bands in \{1 1 1\}(1 1 0) deformed matrices. The
   initial casting texture tends to produce more cube deformation bands and
   cube shear bands compared with conventional processes. Moreover, the
   selected processing parameters are favorable for making various
   nucleation sites work effectively at a very early stage of
   recrystallization. The results obtained in the present study can provide
   an efficient way for cube texture control in body-centered cubic alloys.

Abstract = {{The combustion of aluminum particle, liquid water, and hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2) mixtures is studied theoretically for a pressure range of 1-20
   MPa and particle sizes between 3 and 70 mu m. The oxidizer-to-fuel (O/F)
   weight ratio is varied in the range of 1.00-1.67, and four different
   H2O2 concentrations of 0\%, 30\%, 60\%, and 90\% are considered. A
   multi-zone flame model is developed to determine the burning behaviors
   and combustion-wave structures by solving the energy equation in each
   zone and enforcing the temperature and heat-flux continuities at the
   interfacial boundaries. The entrainment of particles is taken into
   account. Key parameters that dictate the burning properties of mixtures
   are found to be the thermal diffusivity, flame temperature, particle
   burning time, ignition temperature, and entrainment index of particles.
   When the pressure increases from 1 to 20 MPa, the flame thickness
   decreases by a factor of two. The ensuing enhancement of conductive heat
   flux to the unburned mixture thus increases the burning rate, which
   exhibits a pressure dependence of the form r(b) = ap(m). The exponent,
   m, depends on reaction kinetics and convective motion of particles.
   Transition from diffusion to kinetically-controlled conditions causes
   the pressure exponent to increase from 0.35 at 70 mu m to 1.04 at 3 mu
   m. The addition of hydrogen peroxide has a positive effect on the
   burning properties. The burning rate is nearly doubled when the
   concentration of hydrogen peroxide increases from 0 to 90\%. For the
   conditions encountered in this study, the following correlation for the
   burning rate is developed: r(b){[}cm/s] = 4.97(p{[}MPa])(0.37)(d(p){[}mu
   m])(-0.85)(O/F)(-0.54) exp (0.0066C(H2O2)). (C) 2014 The Combustion

Title = {{Effect of Hinge Gap Width of a St. Jude Medical Bileaflet Mechanical
   Heart Valve on Blood Damage Potential-An In Vitro Micro Particle Image
   Velocimetry Study}},

Abstract = {{The hinge regions of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve (BMHV) can
   cause blood element damage due to nonphysiological shear stress levels
   and regions of flow stasis. Recently, a micro particle image velocimetry
   (mu PIV) system was developed to study whole flow fields within BMHV
   hinge regions with enhanced spatial resolution under steady leakage flow
   conditions. However, global velocity maps under pulsatile conditions are
   still necessary to fully understand the blood damage potential of these
   valves. The current study hypothesized that the hinge gap width will
   affect flow fields in the hinge region. Accordingly, the blood damage
   potential of three St. Jude Medical (SJM) BMHVs with different hinge gap
   widths was investigated under pulsatile flow conditions, using a mu PIV
   system. The results demonstrated that the hinge gap width had a
   significant influence during the leakage flow phase in terms of washout
   and shear stress characteristics. During the leakage flow, the largest
   hinge gap generated the highest Reynolds shear stress (RSS) magnitudes
   (similar to 1000 N/m(2)) among the three valves at the ventricular side
   of the hinge. At this location, all three valves indicated viscous shear
   stresses (VSS) greater than 30 N/m(2). The smallest hinge gap exhibited
   the lowest level of shear stress values, but had the poorest washout
   flow characteristics among the three valves, demonstrating propensity
   for flow stasis and associated activated platelet accumulation
   potential. The results from this study indicate that the hinge is a
   critical component of the BMHV design, which needs to be optimized to
   find the appropriate balance between reduction in fluid shear stresses
   and enhanced washout during leakage flow, to ensure minimal thrombotic
   complications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a hybrid control framework for addressing
   multiagent formation control protocols for general nonlinear dynamical
   systems using hybrid stabilization of sets. The proposed framework
   develops a novel class of fixed-order, energy-based hybrid controllers
   as a means for achieving cooperative control formations, which can
   include flocking, cyclic pursuit, rendezvous, and consensus control of
   multiagent systems. These dynamic controllers combine a logical
   switching architecture with the continuous system dynamics to guarantee
   that a system generalized energy function whose zero level set
   characterizes a specified system formation is strictly decreasing across
   switchings. The proposed approach addresses general nonlinear dynamical
   systems and is not limited to systems involving single and double
   integrator dynamics for consensus and formation control or unicycle
   models for cyclic pursuit. Finally, several numerical examples involving
   flocking, rendezvous, consensus, and circular formation protocols for
   standard system formation models are provided to demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Guided wave imaging with a distributed array of inexpensive transducers
   offers a fast and cost-efficient means for damage detection and
   localization in plate-like structures such as aircraft and spacecraft
   skins. As such, this technology is a natural choice for inclusion in
   condition-based maintenance and integrated structural health management
   programs. One of the implementation challenges results from the complex
   interaction of propagating ultrasonic waves with both the interrogation
   structure and potential defects or damage. For example, a guided
   ultrasonic wave interacts with a surface or sub-surface defect
   differently depending on the angle of incidence, defect size and
   orientation, excitation frequency, and guided wave mode. However, this
   complex interaction also provides a mechanism for guided wave imaging
   algorithms to perform damage characterization in addition to damage
   detection and localization. Damage characterization provides a mechanism
   to help discriminate actual damage (e.g. fatigue cracks) from benign
   changes, and can be used with crack propagation models to estimate
   remaining life. This work proposes the use of minimum variance imaging
   to perform damage detection, localization, and characterization.
   Scattering assumptions used to perform damage characterization are
   obtained through both analytical and finite element models. Experimental
   data from an in situ distributed array are used to demonstrate
   feasibility of this approach using a through-hole and two
   through-thickness notches of different orientations to simulate damage
   in an aluminum plate.}},

Abstract = {{The energy losses of a silicon lateral rotary micro-resonator operating

   damping (the dominant energy loss source), unlike the analytical model
   capturing as little as 50\% of the experimental values. The results
   showed that a significant portion of energy losses are associated with
   the complex three-dimensional path lines near the micro-resonator's

Abstract = {{In multiple operational scenarios, explosive charges are used to
   neutralize confined or unconfined stores of bacterial spores. The spore
   destruction is achieved by post-detonation combustion and mixing of hot
   detonation product gases with the ambient flow and spore clouds. In this
   work, blast wave interaction with bacterial spore clouds and the effect
   of post-detonation combustion on spore neutralization are investigated
   using numerical simulations. Spherical explosive charges (radius, = 5.9
   cm) comprising of nitromethane are modeled in the vicinity of a spore
   cloud, and the spore kill in the post-detonation flow is quantified. The
   effect of the mass of the spores and the initial distance, , of the
   spore cloud from the explosive charge on the percentage of spores
   neutralized is investigated. When the spores are initially placed within
   a distance of 3.0, within 0.1 ms after detonation of the charge, all the
   spores are neutralized by the blast wave and the hot detonation product
   gases. In contrast, almost all the spores survived the explosion when is
   greater than 8.0. The percentage of intact spores varied from 0 to 100
   for 3.0 8.0 with spore neutralization dependent on time spent by the
