Abstract = {{Cathepsins are powerful proteases, once referred to as the lysosomal
   cysteine proteases, that have been implicated in breast cancer invasion
   and metastasis, but pharmaceutical inhibitors have suffered failures in
   clinical trials due to adverse side effects. Scientific advancement from
   lysosomotropic to cell impermeable cathepsin inhibitors have improved
   efficacy in treating disease, but off-target effects have still been
   problematic, motivating a need to better understand cellular feedback
   and responses to treatment with cathepsin inhibitors. To address this
   need, we investigated effects of E-64 and cystatin C, two broad spectrum
   cathepsin inhibitors, on cathepsin levels intra- and extracellularly in
   MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cathepsins S and L had opposing
   responses to both E-64 and cystatin C inhibitor treatments with
   paradoxically elevated amounts of active cathepsin S, but decreased
   amounts of active cathepsin L, as determined by multiplex cathepsin
   zymography. This indicated cellular feedback to selectively sustain the
   amounts of active cathepsin S even in the presence of inhibitors with
   subnanomolar inhibitory constant values. These differences were
   identified in cellular locations of cathepsins L and S, trafficking for
   secretion, co-localization with endocytosed inhibitors, and longer
   protein turnover time for cathepsin S compared to cathepsin L Together,
   this work demonstrates that previously underappreciated cellular
   compensation and compartmentalization mechanisms may sustain elevated
   amounts of some active cathepsins while diminishing others after
   inhibitor treatment. This can confound predictions based solely on
   inhibitor kinetics, and must be better understood to effectively deploy
   therapies and dosing strategies that target cathepsins to prevent cancer
   progression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Advent of 2.5/3Dimensional (2.5/3D) integration using through-silicon
   vias (TSVs) enables the formation of high signal bandwidth, fine pitch,
   and short-distance interconnections in stacked dies but the new package
   configuration poses technical challenges in package assembly process. To
   pace industry demands, a new alternative, Thermal Compression Bonding
   (TCB), to the conventional Flip Chip on Board (FCOB) process has been
   being developed for the 3D stacking. Among process materials, epoxy flux
   (or no-flow underfill) draws high attention again due to its technical
   advantages in both TCB and mass reflow process. The conventional mass
   reflow with epoxy flux could provide outstanding benefits to 2.5D
   package assembly process. The new Low Cost High Throughput Flip Chip
   Assembly process is one such process requiring fewer processing steps,
   lower cycle times, and lower cost. In this new process, underfill is
   dispensed prior to chip placement, and solder reflow and underfill cure
   occur simultaneously. This reduces the cycle time required for
   manufacture; however, the presence of a viscous underfill affects the
   chips' capacity for self-alignment. In a companion study, self-alignment
   for a flip chip undergoing rectilinear translation was analyzed. This
   paper applies an equivalent analysis process to a flip chip undergoing
   rotation in the presence of a viscous underfill. Details of the modeling
   process are presented along with parametric studies and contrasted
   against pure translation case. Conditions and process parameters which
   are more conducive to realignment and those hampering realignment are
   presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a full-reference image quality estimator based on
   color, structure, and visual system characteristics denoted as CSV. In
   contrast to the majority of existing methods, we quantify perceptual
   color degradations rather than absolute pixel-wise changes. We use the
   CIEDE2000, color difference formulation to quantify low-level color
   degradations and the Earth Mover's Distance between color name
   probability vectors to measure significant color degradations. In
   addition to the perceptual color difference, CSV also contains
   structural and perceptual differences. Structural feature maps are
   obtained by mean subtraction and divisive normalization, and perceptual
   feature maps are obtained from contrast sensitivity formulations of
   retinal ganglion cells. The proposed quality estimator CSV is tested on
   the LIVE, the Multiply Distorted LIVE, and the TID 2013 databases, and
   it is always among the top two performing quality estimators in terms of
   at least ranking, monotonic behavior or linearity. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the most widely studied conducting metal
   oxide and serves as the best candidate for proof-of-concept experiments
   in the field of surface plasmon resonance and studies of electric field
   confinement and manipulation. ITO is chemically stable and relatively
   easy to sputter. In this report, arrays of ITO nanostructures were
   produced using nanosphere lithography, which was originally developed
   for plasmonic applications involving noble metals. However, the
   experiments presented here show that patterned ITO with similar size and
   shape to noble metals has an observed extinction that corresponds to the
   epsilon-near-zero mode. The carrier density of ITO nanostructure can be
   controlled by the postdeposition annealing process. Thus, one can prove
   that the optical signals on the surface are those of the ITO
   nanostructure by reversible on/off switching of the capacitive plasmon
   resonance by annealing the surfaces successively in forming gas
   (N-2/H-2) and in air. Thus, using conducting metal oxides confident of
   the electric field is possible not only along the z-axis perpendicular
   to the thin film but within the plane of the film as well.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient multi-machine cooperation and network dynamics still remain
   open that jeopardize great applications in large-scale
   machine-to-machine (M2M) networks. Among all possible machine
   cooperation controls, to synchronize tremendous machines in a
   timing-efficient brings one of the greatest challenge and serves as the
   foundation for any other network control policies. In this paper, we
   propose a linear-time synchronization protocol in large M2M networks.
   Specifically, a closed-form of synchronization rate is provided by
   developing the statistical bounds of the second smallest eigenvalue of
   the graph Laplacian matrix. These bounds enable the efficient control of
   network dynamics, facilitating the timing synchronization in networks.
   Through a practical study in Metropolis, simulation results confirm our
   theoretical analysis and provide effective selection of wireless
   technologies, including Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular systems, with
   respect to the deployed density of machines. Therefore, this paper
   successfully demonstrates a practical timing synchronization, to make a
   breakthrough of network dynamic control in real-world machine systems,

Title = {{Municipal solid waste and dung cake burning: discoloring the Taj Mahal
   and human health impacts in Agra}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Taj Mahal-an iconic World Heritage monument built of white
   marble-has become discolored with time, due, in part, to high levels of
   particulate matter (PM) soiling its surface (Bergin et al 2015 Environ.
   Sci. Technol. 49 808-812). Such discoloration has required extensive and
   costly treatment (2015 Two Hundred Sixty Second Report on Effects of
   Pollution on Taj Parliament of India Rajya Sabha, New Delhi) and despite
   previous interventions to reduce pollution in its vicinity, the haze and
   darkening persists (Bergin et al 2015 Environ. Sci. Technol. 49 808-812;
   2015 Two Hundred Sixty Second Report on Effects of Pollution on Taj
   Parliament of India Rajya Sabha, New Delhi). PM responsible for the
   soiling has been attributed to a variety of sources including industrial
   emissions, vehicular exhaust and biomass burning, but the contribution
   of the emissions from the burning of open municipal solid waste (MSW)
   may also play an important role. A recent source apportionment study of
   fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at the Taj Mahal showed biomass burning
   emissions, which would include MSW emissions, accounted for nearly 40\%
   of organic matter (OM)-a component of PM-deposition to its surface
   (Bergin et al 2015 Environ. Sci. Technol. 49 808-812); dung cake
   burning, used extensively for cooking in the region, was the suggested
   culprit and banned within the city limits (2015 Two Hundred Sixty Second
   Report on Effects of Pollution on Taj Parliament of India Rajya Sabha,
   New Delhi), although the burning of MSW, a ubiquitous practice in the
   area (Nagpure et al 2015 Environ. Sci. Technol. 49 12904-12), may play a
   more important role in local air quality. Using spatially detailed
   emission estimates and air quality modeling, we find that open MSW
   burning leads to about 150 (+/- 130) mgm(-2) yr(-1) of PM2.5 being
   deposited to the surface of the Taj Mahal compared to about 12 (+/- 3.2)
   mgm(-2) yr(-1) from dung cake burning. Those two sources, combined, also
   lead to an estimated 713 (377-1050) premature mortalities in Agra each
   year, dominated by waste burning in socioeconomically lower status
   neighborhoods. An effectiveMSWmanagement strategy would reduce soiling
   of the Taj Mahal, improve human health, and have additional aesthetic
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The control problem for a mechanical system to follow a constraint is
   formulated. The uncertainty is considered in both the system dynamics
   and constraint. It is bounded, and the knowledge of the bound only lies
   within a fuzzy set. We propose an adaptive robust control for the
   mechanical system for approximate constraint-following. Both the
   mechanical system model and control scheme are deterministic and not
   IF-THEN heuristic rules-based. An optimal design problem using the fuzzy
   description of the uncertainty is proposed. We prove that the global
   solution to the resulting optimization problem always exists and is
   unique. Under the control, the performance of the mechanical system is
   both deterministically guaranteed and fuzzily optimized.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the demand for more radio spectrum resources, mobile operators
   are looking to exploit the unlicensed spectrum as a complement to the
   licensed spectrum. LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U), also referred to as
   licensed-assisted access by the third generation partnership project, is
   an extension of the LTE standard operating on the unlicensed spectrum.
   To realize LTE-U, its coexistence with Wi-Fi systems is the main
   challenge and must be addressed. In this paper, a listen-beforetalk
   access mechanism featuring an adaptive distributed control function
   protocol is adopted for the small base stations (SBSs), whereby the
   backoff window size is adaptively adjusted according to the available
   licensed spectrum bandwidth and the Wi-Fi traffic load to satisfy the
   quality-of-service requirements of small cell users and minimize the
   collision probability of Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, both licensed and
   unlicensed spectrum bands are jointly allocated to optimize spectrum
   efficiency. An admission control mechanism is further developed for the
   SBS to limit collision withWi-Fi traffic. Extensive simulation results
   show that the proposed schemes achieve fair and harmonious coexistence
   between LTE-U small cells and the surrounding Wi-Fi service sets and
   substantially outperform baseline non-adaptive channel access mechanisms
   in the unlicensed spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{A newly developed coupled neutronic thermal-hydraulic method for
   prismatic high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) is presented with
   accompanying results for several prismatic core configurations and
   numerical sensitivity studies. The principal advantage of the new method
   is the determination of coupled, whole-core temperature and pin power
   distributions with reduced computational effort over other available
   codes. The coarse-mesh radiation transport method (COMET), which relies
   solely on radiation transport, is the component of the new method used
   to compute neutronic parameters. A three-dimensional unit-cell based
   thermal fluids solver is used to compute steady-state thermal-hydraulic
   parameters. For both component methods, no geometric approximations or
   averaging schemes are necessary. Convergence of the neutronic and
   thermal-hydraulic components and the coupled method is discussed, and
   coupled analyses are presented. The calculation of whole-core solutions
   allows for unique insights not possible with limited domain tools such
   as computational fluid dynamics. Results from one such unique study,
   near-critical control rod movements, are presented in this paper.
   Comparisons between coupled and uncoupled analyses are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Passivity analysis provides a convenient measure to assess the stability
   of haptic systems interacting with virtual environments. Passivity
   analysis of haptic sampled-data systems coupled with virtual
   environments requires knowledge of parameters of the employed
   environment model. Kelvin-Voigt models have been popularly used to
   describe viscoelastic behavior of soft tissues being simulated in a
   virtual environment. This paper employs a standard linear solid model
   that has been recently shown to be better suited to represent the
   behavior of the actual soft tissues, and provides passivity analysis of
   the haptic systems interacting with virtual viscoelastic soft tissues
   based on the standard linear solid model. The analysis results in a new
   criterion for design and control of passive haptic interfaces. The
   effect of the employed discretization method on passivity is also
   discussed. Experimental results show that the new passivity criterion is
   less conservative. This criterion increases the domain of soft-tissue
   environments that can be interacted with passively by the haptic
   interface.}},

Title = {{Measuring the Benefit of Offering Auxiliary Services: Do Bag-Checkers
   Differ in Their Sensitivities to Airline Itinerary Attributes?}},
Journal = {{PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{When firms evaluate their service system design choices, there is
   typically more uncertainty surrounding the value that a particular
   auxiliary service provides than there is on the cost of providing that
   service. To help inform this decision, we propose an approach where we
   compare the relative value of the segment of passengers who use an
   auxiliary service to the relative value of the segment that does not use
   it. We demonstrate this approach for a typical auxiliary service common
   to the airline industry. In 2008, most US airlines implemented checked
   baggage fee policies to decrease their costs by reducing the number of
   customer service agents needed in the check-in and baggage handling
   processes. The success of this change has led to a current debate at
   many of these airlines on whether to make further staffing cuts in these
   areas, essentially making it even less attractive for passengers to
   check their baggage. Our proposed methodology helps answer whether
   passengers who continue to check bags in today's baggage-fee era are
   more or less valuable than passengers who do not check bags. We explore
   this question empirically by examining, through a stated preference
   survey, if a history of checking or not checking bags can be used to
   segment passengers based on how their itinerary choices are influenced
   by common airline service attributes (on-time performance, itinerary
   time, number of connections, airfare, and schedule delay). Contrary to
   the opinions of some top airline executives, we find that the passengers
   who continue to check bags at airlines that charge baggage fees are
   generally less sensitive to differences in three of these important
   service attributes and are less likely to switch airlines when a
   competing airline improves its offerings along these dimensions. Thus,
   airlines that charge for checked bags should consider improving the
   customer experience for their bag-checking passengers, as they represent
   a potentially more valuable segment class to the airline.}},

Title = {{Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Mimicking the

Abstract = {{In vitro bone regeneration strategies that prime mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) with chondrogenic factors, to mimic aspects of the endochondral
   ossification process, have been shown to promote mineralization and
   vascularization by MSCs both in vitro and when implanted in vivo.
   However, these approaches required the use of osteogenic supplements,
   namely dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and -glycerophosphate, none of
   which are endogenous mediators of bone formation in vivo. Rather MSCs,
   endothelial progenitor cells, and chondrocytes all reside in proximity
   within the cartilage template and might paracrineally regulate
   osteogenic differentiation. Thus, this study tests the hypothesis that
   an in vitro bone regeneration approach that mimics the cellular niche
   existing during endochondral ossification, through coculture of MSCs,
   endothelial cells, and chondrocytes, will obviate the need for
   extraneous osteogenic supplements and provide an alternative strategy to
   elicit osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and mineral production. The
   specific objectives of this study were to (1) mimic the cellular niche
   existing during endochondral ossification and (2) investigate whether
   osteogenic differentiation could be induced without the use of any
   external growth factors. To test the hypothesis, we evaluated the
   mineralization and vessel formation potential of (a) a novel methodology
   involving both chondrogenic priming and the coculture of human umbilical
   vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and MSCs compared with (b) chondrogenic
   priming of MSCs alone, (c) addition of HUVECs to chondrogenically primed
   MSC aggregates, (d-f) the same experimental groups cultured in the
   presence of osteogenic supplements and (g) a noncoculture group cultured
   in the presence of osteogenic growth factors alone. Biochemical (DNA,
   alkaline phosphatase {[}ALP], calcium, CD31(+), vascular endothelial
   growth factor {[}VEGF]), histological (alcian blue, alizarin red), and
   immunohistological (CD31(+)) analyses were conducted to investigate
   osteogenic differentiation and vascularization at various time points
   (1, 2, and 3 weeks). The coculture methodology enhanced both
   osteogenesis and vasculogenesis compared with osteogenic differentiation
   alone, whereas osteogenic supplements inhibited the osteogenesis and
   vascularization (ALP, calcium, and VEGF) induced through coculture
   alone. Taken together, these results suggest that chondrogenic and
   vascular priming can obviate the need for osteogenic supplements to
   induce osteogenesis of human MSCs in vitro, while allowing for the
   formation of rudimentary vessels.}},

Title = {{Self-Assembled Materials Made from Functional Recombinant Proteins}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Proteins are potent molecules that can be used as therapeutics, sensors,
   and biocatalysts with many advantages over small-molecule counterparts
   due to the specificity of their activity based on their amino acid
   sequence and folded three-dimensional structure. However, they also have
   significant limitations in their stability, localization, and recovery
   when used in soluble form. These opportunities and challenges have
   motivated the creation of materials from such functional proteins in
   order to protect and present them in a way that enhances their function.
   We have designed functional recombinant fusion proteins capable of
   self-assembling into materials with unique structures that maintain or
   improve the functionality of the protein. Fusion of either a functional
   protein or an assembly domain to a leucine zipper domain makes the
   materials design strategy modular, based on the high affinity between
   leucine zippers. The self-assembly domains, including elastin-like
   polypeptides (ELPs) and defined-sequence random coil polypeptides, can
   be fused with a leucine zipper motif in order to promote assembly of the
   fusion proteins into larger structures upon specific stimuli such as
   temperature and ionic strength. Fusion of other functional domains with
   the counterpart leucine zipper motif endows the self-assembled materials
   with protein-specific functions such as fluorescence or catalytic
   activity. In this Account, we describe several examples of materials
   assembled from functional fusion proteins as well as the structural
   characterization, functionality, and understanding of the assembly
   Mechanism. The first example is zipper fusion proteins containing ELPs
   that assemble into particles when introduced to a model extracellular
   matrix and subsequently disassemble over time to release the functional
   protein for drug delivery applications. Under different conditions, the
   same fusion proteins can self assemble into hollow vesicles. The
   vesicles display a functional protein on the surface and can also carry
   protein, small-molecule, or nanoparticle cargo in the vesicle lumen. To
   create a material with a more complex hierarchical structure, we
   combined calcium phosphate with zipper fusion proteins containing random
   coil polypeptides to produce hybrid protein inorganic supraparticles
   with high surface area and porous structure. The use of a functional
   enzyme created supraparticles with the ability to degrade inflammatory
   cytokines.
   Our characterization of these protein materials revealed that the
   molecular interactions are complex because of the large size of the
   protein building blocks, their folded structures, and the number of
   potential interactions including hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic
   interactions, van der Waals forces, and specific affinity-based
   interactions. It is difficult or even impossible to predict the
   structures a priori. However, once the basic assembly principles are
   understood, there is opportunity to tune the material properties, such
   as size, through control of the self-assembly conditions. Our future
   efforts on the fundamental side will focus on identifying the phase
   space of self-assembly of these fusion proteins and additional
   experimental levers with which to control and tune the resulting
   materials. On the application side, we are investigating an array of
   different functional proteins to expand the use of these structures in
   both therapeutic protein delivery and biocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry of n- and p-type thermoelectric elements (TE) in terms of
   the cross-sectional area and length were optimized to yield either
   maximum thermal conversion efficiency eta(th,max) or maximum power

   temperature-dependent material properties and independent thermal and
   electrical contact resistances that are a function of the contact area
   per TE leg. Additionally, eta(th,max) and P-o,P-max were quantified by
   simultaneously optimizing the TE geometry and varying the hot-side fluid
   temperature, cold- and hot-side heat exchanger effective area and heat
   transfer coefficients using a complete one-dimensional thermal
   resistance network model. Optimized compared to non-optimized
   geometries, excluding contact resistances, achieve a maximum 10.4\%
   increase in P-o,P-max and 3.2\% increase in eta(th,max) for conditions
   studied. Optimized compared to non-optimized geometries, taking into
   account independent thermal and electrical contact resistances, exhibit
   a 29\% increase in volumetric power density and 12\% increase in
   volumetric efficiency in comparison to non-optimized cases. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Public investment in river restoration through environmental watering
   has increased substantially in recent years. To sustain public support
   for such investment, management of environmental water must achieve the
   best possible outcomes in a transparent and defensible manner. The
   current management of environmental water relies on the ability of
   managers to estimate the impacts of their decisions under complex
   scenarios, often with multiple interdependent decisions that span over
   different spatial and temporal scales. Optimization modeling has been
   widely used in other forms of conservation management and an increasing
   body of literature documents the development of optimization models that
   could be used to improve environmental water decisions. This paper
   reviews this disparate research, showing that there are a range of
   different questions addressed using this modeling approach and that the
   representation of environmental outcomes varies. Future work must focus
   on improved adoption through engagement with end users and stakeholders
   during model development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water surface microlayer (SML), as the interface between water and the

   those of underlying water. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate
   the SML enrichment of nanoparticles (NPs) by using silver nano particles
   (AgNPs) as a model via indoor experiments. The occurrence of SML
   enrichment of AgNPs was confirmed by the increased concentration of NPs
   in the SML relative to that in the bulk phase, and the in situ recording
   of the enhanced Raman spectroscopy intensity of a probe adsorbed on
   AgNPs in the SML. The significant enrichment of NPs is strongly
   influenced by environmentally relevant factors such as the solution pH,
   ionic strength, and natural organic matter. Additionally, the SML
   enrichment factor was estimated to be 14.6-26.5 for AgNPs in natural
   waters. Our findings indicate that NPs are inclined to accumulate in the

Abstract = {{Transportation networks constitute a critical infrastructure enabling
   the transfers of passengers and goods, with a significant impact on the
   economy at different scales. Transportation modes are coupled and
   interdependent. The frequent occurrence of perturbations on one or
   several modes disrupts passengers' entire journeys, directly and through
   ripple effects. Collaborative decision-making has shown significant
   benefits at the airport level, both in the U.S. and in Europe. This
   paper examines how it could be extended to the multimodal network level,
   discusses the supporting evidence, and provides recommendations for
   implementation. A case study on the disruption management following the
   Asiana Crash at San Francisco International Airport is presented. The
   crash led to a large number of flight diversions to many airports, such
   as Oakland, Los Angeles, but also Seattle for instance, disrupting the
   journeys of thousands of passengers. Passenger reaccommodation varied
   greatly from airline to airline and airport to airport. First, a
   passenger-centric reaccommodation scheme is developed to balance costs
   and delays, for each diversion airport. Second, assuming better
   information sharing and collaborative decision-making, we show that
   there was enough capacity at the neighboring airports, Oakland and San
   Jose, to accommodate most of the diverted flights and reoptimize the
   allocation of flight diversions to the Bay Area airports. Based on this
   case study, recommendations for the adoption of multimodal CDM are
   elaborated. This paper paves the way for further data-driven research
   for increased resilience of passenger door-to-door journeys.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Accurate diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity is
   central to proper treatment. Although numerous approaches exist, an
   accurate, gold-standard clinical technique remains elusive. The authors
   previously reported on the initial development and demonstration of the
   automated three-dimensional (3D) field optimization method (FOM)
   algorithm, which exploits 3D color Doppler ultrasound imaging and builds
   on existing MR quantification techniques. The aim of the present study
   was to extensively validate 3D FOM in terms of accuracy, ease of use,
   and repeatability.
   Methods: Three-dimensional FOM was applied to five explanted ovine
   mitral valves in a left heart simulator, which were systematically
   perturbed to yield a total of 29 unique regurgitant geometries.
   Three-dimensional FOM was compared with a gold-standard flow probe, as
   well as the most clinically prevalent MR volume quantification
   technique, the two-dimensional (2D) proximal isovelocity surface area
   (PISA) method.
   Results: Overall, 3D FOM overestimated and 2D PISA underestimated MR
   volume, but 3D FOM error had smaller magnitude (5.2 6 +/- 9.9 mL) than
   2D PISA error (-6.9 6 +/- 7.7 mL). Two-dimensional PISA remained
   superior in diagnosis for round orifices and especially mild MR, as
   predicted by ultrasound physics theory. For slit-type orifices and
   severe MR, 3D FOM showed significant improvement over 2D PISA.
   Three-dimensional FOM processing was technically simpler and
   significantly faster than 2D PISA and required fewer ultrasound
   acquisitions. Three-dimensional FOM did not show significant interuser
   variability, whereas 2D PISA did.
   Conclusions: Three-dimensional FOM may provide increased clinical value
   compared with 2D PISA because of increased accuracy in the case of
   complex or severe regurgitant orifices as well as its greater
   repeatability and simpler work flow.}},

Abstract = {{Operation time of implantable electronic devices is largely constrained
   by the lifetime of batteries, which have to be replaced periodically by
   surgical procedures once: exhausted; causing physical and mental
   suffering to, patients and increasing healthcare costs. Besides the
   efficient scavenging of the mechanical energy of internal organs, this
   study proposes a self-powered, flexible, and one stop implantable
   triboelectric active sensor (iTEAS) that can provide continuous
   monitoring of multiple physiological and pathological signs. As
   demonstrated in human-scale animals, theldevice can-monitor heart rates,
   reaching an accuracy of similar to 99\%. Cardiac arrhythmias such as
   atrial fibrillation. and ventricular premature contraction can be
   detected in real-time. Furthermore, a novel method of monitoring
   respiratory rates and phases is established by analyzing, variations of
   the output peaks of the iTEAS. Blood pressure can be independently
   estimated and the velocity of blood flow calculated with the aid of a
   separate arteriaPpressure catheter. With the core shell packaging
   strategy,anonitoring functionality remains excellent during 72 h after
   closure of the chests The in vivo biocompatibility of the device is
   examined after 2 weeks of implantation, proving suitability for
   practical use. As a multifunctional biomedical monitor that is exempt
   from needing an external power supply, the proposed iTFAS holds great
   potential in the future of the healthcare industry.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering the elemental composition of metal nano crystals offers an
   effective strategy for the development of catalysts Or electrocatalysts
   with greatly enhanced activity. Herein, we report the synthesis of
   Pt-Ag, alloy nanocages with an outer edge length of 18 nm and a wall
   thickness of about 3 nm. Such nanocages with a composition of Pt19Ag81
   could be readily prepared in one step through the galvanic replacement
   reaction between Ag nanocubes and a Pt(II) precursor. After 10 090
   cycles of potential cycling in the range of 0.60-1.0 V as in an
   accelerated durability test, the composition of the nanocages changed to
   Pt56Ag44, together with a specific activity of 1.23 mA cm(-2) toward
   oxygen reduction, which was 3.3 times that of a state-of-the-art
   commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.37 mA cm(-2)) prior to durability testing.
   Density functional theory calculations attributed the increased activity
   to the stabilization of the transition state for breaking the O-O bond
   in molecular oxygen. Even after 30 000 cycles of potential cycling) the
   Mass activity of the nanocages only dropped from 0.64 to 0.33 A
   mg(Pt)(-1), which was still about two times that of the pristine Pt/C
   catalyst (0.19 A mg(Pt)(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{Volcanic eruptions are at their most deadly when pyroclastic density
   currents sweep across landscapes to devastate everything in their
   path(1,2). The internal dynamics underpinning these hazards cannot be
   directly observed(3). Here we present a quantitative view inside
   pyroclastic density currentsby synthesizing their natural flow behaviour
   in large-scale experiments. The experiments trace flow dynamics from
   initiation to deposition, and can explain the sequence and evolution of
   real-world deposits. We show that, inside pyroclastic density currents,
   the long-hypothesized non-turbulent underflow and fully turbulent
   ash-cloud regions(4,5) are linked through a hitherto unrecognized middle
   zone of intermediate turbulence and concentration. Bounded by abrupt
   jumps in turbulence, the middle zone couples underflow and ash-cloud
   regions kinematically. Inside this zone, strong feedback between gas and
   particle phases leads to the formation of mesoscale turbulence clusters.
   These extremely fast-settling dendritic structures dictate the internal
   stratification and evolution of pyroclastic density currents and allow
   the underflows to grow significantly during runout. Our experiments
   reveal how the underflow and ash-cloud regions are dynamically
   related-insights that are relevant to the forecasting of pyroclastic
   density current behaviour in volcanic hazard models.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{866+}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous materials are used for both structural and functional
   applications(1-5). An amorphous solid usually forms under driven
   conditions such as melt quenching(4), irradiation(6), shock loading(7-9)
   or severe mechanical deformation(10). Such extreme conditions impose
   significant challenges on the direct observation of the amorphization
   process. Various experimental techniques have been used to detect how
   the amorphous phases form, including synchrotron X-ray diffraction(11),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM)(12) and Raman spectroscopy(13),
   but a dynamic, atomistic characterization has remained elusive. Here, by
   using in situ high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), we show the dynamic
   amorphization process in silicon nanocrystals during mechanical
   straining on the atomic scale. We find that shear-driven amorphization
   occurs in a dominant shear band starting with the diamond-cubic (dc) to
   diamond-hexagonal (dh) phase transition and then proceeds by dislocation
   nucleation and accumulation in the newly formed dh-Si phase. This
   process leads to the formation of an amorphous Si (a-Si) band, embedded
   with dh-Si nanodomains. The amorphization of dc-Si via an intermediate
   dh-Si phase is a previously unknown pathway of solid-state
   amorphization.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-inspired hydrodynamic thrust generation using smart materials has
   received growing attention over the past few years to enable improved
   maneuverability and agility, small form factor, reduced power
   consumption, and ease of fabrication in next-generation aquatic
   swimmers. In order to develop a high-fidelity model to predict the
   electrohydroelastic dynamics of macro-fiber composite (MFC)
   piezoelectric structures, in this work, mixing rules-based (i.e. rule of
   mixtures) electroelastic mechanics formulation is coupled with the
   global electroelastic dynamics based on the Euler-Bernoulli kinematics
   and nonlinear fluid loading based on Morison's semi-empirical model. The
   focus is placed on the dynamic actuation problem for the first two
   bending vibration modes under geometrically and materially linear,
   hydrodynamically nonlinear behavior. The electroelastic and dielectric
   properties of a representative volume element (piezoelectric fiber and
   epoxy matrix) between two subsequent interdigitated electrodes are
   correlated to homogenized parameters of MFC bimorphs and validated for a
   set of MFCs that have the same overhang length but different widths.
   Following this process of electroelastic model development and
   validation, underwater actuation experiments are conducted for different
   length-to-width aspect ratios (L/b) in quiescent water, and the
   empirical drag and inertia coefficients are extracted from Morison's
   equation to establish the electrohydroelastic model. The repeatability
   of these empirical coefficients is demonstrated for experiments
   conducted using aluminum cantilevers of different aspect ratios with a
   focus on the first two bending modes. The convergence of the nonlinear
   electrohydroelastic Euler-Bernoulli-Morison model to its
   hydrodynamically linear counterpart for increased L/b values is also
   reported. The proposed model, its harmonic balance analysis, and
   experimental results can be used not only for underwater piezoelectric
   actuation, but also for sensing and energy harvesting problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optimal energy dissipation control algorithm is
   applied into a semi-active suspension-type tuned mass damper (SA-STMD)
   to suppress excessive vibration by means of variable pendulum length.
   The SA-STMD mechanism consists of a mass block, a suspension rope, and a
   movable fulcrum that can be a short tube driven by a linear motor to
   vertically move along the suspension rope. As the fulcrum goes up, the
   pendulum length is extended, resulting in a smaller stiffness of the
   SA-STMD, and vice versa. Accordingly, the restoring force in the SA-STMD
   can be adjusted by varying the fulcrum positions. In the case where the
   energy dissipation ability by the original STMDs is insufficient, the
   movable fulcrum in the SA-STMD system can compensate the STMDs for
   stiffness according to the proposed optimal energy dissipation control
   algorithm to provide controllable restoring forces. The controllable
   restoring forces are designed to act as viscous dampers that can make up
   for the lack of energy dissipation capacity. The numerical results from
   the time domain and frequency domain analyses show that the proposed
   approach utilizing the optimal energy dissipation control algorithm to
   adjust the pendulum length can induce controllable restoring forces with
   a butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop, supplying a sufficient energy
   dissipation capacity to reduce responses to the unexpectedly large
   external vibration. Another potential benefit is cost reduction because
   of use of a less number of conventional viscous dampers in the STMD
   system. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{A comparative life-cycle energy and emissions analysis for intercity
   passenger transportation in the US by aviation, intercity bus, and

Abstract = {{Intercity passenger trips constitute a significant source of energy
   consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and criteria pollutant emissions.
   The most commonly used city-to-city modes in the United States include
   aircraft, intercity bus, and automobile. This study applies
   state-of-the-practice models to assess life-cycle fuel consumption and
   pollutant emissions for intercity trips via aircraft, intercity bus, and
   automobile. The analyses compare the fuel and emissions impacts of
   different travel mode scenarios for intercity trips ranging from 200 to
   1600 km. Because these modes operate differently with respect to engine
   technology, fuel type, and vehicle capacity, the modeling techniques and
   modeling boundaries vary significantly across modes. For aviation
   systems, much of the energy and emissions are associated with auxiliary
   equipment activities, infrastructure power supply, and terminal
   activities, in addition to the vehicle operations between origin
   destination. Furthermore, one should not ignore the embodied energy and
   initial emissions from the manufacturing of the vehicles, and the
   construction of airports, bus stations, highways and parking lots.
   Passenger loading factors and travel distances also significantly
   influence fuel and emissions results on a per-traveler basis. The
   results show intercity bus is generally the most fuel-efficient mode and
   produced the lowest per-passenger-trip emissions for the entire range of
   trip distances examined. Aviation is not a fuel-efficient mode for short
   trips (<500 km), primarily due to the large energy impacts associated
   with takeoff and landing, and to some extent from the emissions of
   ground support equipment associated with any trip distance. However,
   aviation is more energy efficient and produces less emissions
   per-passenger-trip than low-occupancy automobiles for trip distances
   longer than 700-800 km. This study will help inform policy makers and
   transportation system operators about how differently each intercity
   system perform across all activities, and provides a basis for future
   policies designed to encourage mode shifts by range of service. The
   estimation procedures used in this study can serve as a reference for
   future analyses of transportation scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{With today's environmental concerns and the diminishing supply of the
   world's petroleum-based chemicals and materials, much focus has been
   directed toward alternative sources. Woody biomass presents a promising
   option due to its sheer abundance, renewability, and biodegradability.
   Lignin, a highly irregular polyphenolic compound, is one of the major
   chemical constituents of woody biomass and is the second most abundant
   biopolymer on Earth, surpassed only by cellulose. The pulp and paper and
   cellulosic ethanol industries produce lignin on the scale of millions of
   tons each year as a by-product. Traditionally, lignin has been viewed as
   a waste material and burned as an inefficient fuel. However, in recent
   decades, research has focused on more economical ways to convert lignin
   into value-added commodities, such as biofuels, biomaterials, and
   biochemicals, thus developing and strengthening the concept of fully
   integrated biorefineries. Owing to the phenolic structure of lignin, it
   is possible to enzymatically graft molecules onto its surface using
   laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) to create
   exciting novel biomaterials. These environmentally friendly enzymes use
   oxygen as their only co-substrate and produce water as their sole
   by-product, and have thus found great industrial application. This
   mini-review highlights recent advances in the field of
   laccase-facilitated functionalization of lignin as well as promising
   future directions for lignin-based polymers.}},

Abstract = {{A well-designed, efficient, one-step assembly strategy is implemented in
   this work by constructing a confined nanospace to manufacture an
   approximately 120 nm thick inorganic upconversion (UC) nanofilm with
   highly (101) oriented and morphology-controllable crystal grains, as
   well as transparent and robust characteristics. The morphology and
   distribution density of crystal grains of the film can be tuned by
   varying space heights and precursor concentrations. The confined space
   incubates a stable growing environment for crystal grains to decrease
   crystal defects and grow bigger. Therefore, there are high populations
   of doped Tm ions and high efficiencies of radiation transitions to
   realize multiphotons ultraviolet (UV) (monitoring range: 300-400 nm)
   emissions under laser excitation with a wide power range. Quantum yields
   of the film in the UV region are 4.7 and 16.1 times higher than those of
   UC nanoparticles synthesized by the typical thermal decomposition method
   and hydrothermal method, respectively. The UV-enhanced UC film is
   demonstrated to have the ability to serve as a medium to realize
   near-infrared induced undersurface photochemical reactions, which may
   inspire broad applications, such as UC three-dimensional printing.}},

   (AD) techniques previously used for accurately detecting the phase
   variations of reflected signals of continuous wave radars to UWB pulse
   radars as well. These detection techniques reduce the impact of the
   interfering harmonic signals, thus improving the SNR of the detected
   vital sign signals. To further enhance the accuracy of the HR
   estimation, a recently developed state-space method has been
   successfully combined with CSD and AD techniques and over 10 dB
   improvements in SNR is demonstrated. The implementation of these various
   detection techniques has been experimentally investigated and full error
   and SNR analysis of the HR detection are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic force modeling can quantitatively describe the force with
   amplitude-frequency characteristic and facilitate understanding of the
   influence of grinding parameters on dynamic performance. This research
   attempts to build up dynamic grinding force models through empirical
   approaches. In the paper, the related parameters in the empirical model
   are studied based on the fact that the dynamic grinding force is due to
   the dynamic change of depth of cut and the dynamic model of grinding
   process developed in previous studies. Then grinding force model is
   established using the process parameters like wheel speed, feed rate,
   and dynamic change of depth of cut. At last, the coefficients are
   determined experimentally and the models are verified at specified
   conditions. The grinding parameters, the dynamic process of the
   grinding, and the machine tool conditions are taken into account in the
   paper. The empirical model developed in this paper can be used to
   predict the variation of the dynamic grinding force during process. This
   model can also be used to guide the selection of grinding conditions and
   to develop the machine tool for dynamic performance optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving energy sustainability has imposed a great challenge to improve
   fuel efficient vehicles. Tires, to overcome the rolling resistance, are
   responsible for a rather large fraction of energy consumed by vehicles,
   and a 10\% reduction in the rolling resistance corresponds to a 2\%
   decline in the fuel consumption, which, for instance, would save 1-2
   billion gallon of fuel per year consumed by the entire passenger vehicle
   fleet in the United States. From the materials' perspective, the key
   bottleneck to lower the rolling resistance of tires lies in designing a
   novel kind of advanced elastomeric polymer nanocomposites tailored for
   tire tread, with remarkably low dynamic hysteresis loss (DHL). Here we
   show that, a nano particle chemically end-linking elastomer network,
   with nanoparticles (NPs) acting as netpoints to chemically connect the
   dual end-groups of each polymer chain to form a network, exhibits
   excellent static and dynamic mechanical properties of super-low DHL. The
   DHL is reduced for similar to 50\% compared to silica NPs filled
   elastomer that is conventionally used for tire tread. By taking
   advantage of a library of other nanomaterials such as functionalized
   carbon nanotube and graphene, our approach provides a versatile
   framework to fabricate the fuel-saving tires, opening up valuable
   opportunities for large-scale industrial applications of these
   nanomaterials in the tire industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mixed transition metal oxides with hierarchical, porous structures,
   constructed from interconnected nano-building blocks, are considered
   promising positive electrodes for high-performance hybrid
   supercapacitors. Here we report our findings in design, fabrication, and
   characterization of 3D hierarchical, porous quaternary
   zinc-nickel-aluminum-cobalt oxide (ZNACO) architectures assembled from
   well aligned nanosheets grown directly on nickel foam using a facile and
   scalable chemical bath deposition process followed by calcination. When
   tested as a binder-free electrode in a 3-electrode configuration, the
   ZNACO display high specific capacity (839.2 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and
   outstanding rate capability (similar to 82\% capacity retention from 1 A
   g(-1) to 20 A g(-1)), superior to those of binary-component NiCo2O4 and
   ZnCo2O4 as well as single-component Co3O4 electrode. More remarkably, a
   hybrid supercapacitor consisting of an as-fabricated ZNACO positive
   electrode and an activated carbon negative electrode exhibits a high
   energy density of 72.4 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 533 W kg(-1)
   while maintaining excellent cycling stability (similar to 90\%
   capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1)), demonstrating
   a promising potential for development of high-performance hybrid
   supercapacitors. Further, the unique electrode architecture is also
   applicable to other electrochemical systems such as batteries, fuel
   cells, and membrane reactors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Separation control of the three-dimensional flow over the aft segment of
   a NASA Rotor-Body-Interaction (ROBIN) rotorcraft fuselage is
   investigated in wind-tunnel experiments using arrays of miniature
   combustion-based actuators. Successive pulsed actuation is effected by
   momentary jets each having a characteristic time scaleO{[}1 ms] that is
   an order of magnitude shorter than the convective time scale of the
   flow. The actuators are placed upstream of the transition ramp between
   the ROBIN's fuselage and the tail boom. The jet-induced interactions
   with the massively separated crossflow over the ramp and their effects
   on the global aerodynamic forces and moments are investigated using
   high-resolution particle image velocimetry that is acquired phase-locked
   to the actuation waveform in conjunction with simultaneous force and
   moment measurements using an onboard load cell. The present
   investigations show that symmetric actuation about the model's
   centerline can significantly mitigate separation, lead to a reduction in
   drag and lift, and alter the pitchingmoment. Asymmetric actuation, and
   consequently nonuniform attachment, can induce significant side forces
   as well as roll and yaw moments that may be exploited for steering and
   improved flight maneuverability.}},

   optimum results were obtained at pH 4-5 and 110 degrees C. One of the
   dyes showed a colour yield as good as that of a commercial disperse dye
   and good build-up on poly(lactic acid) fabric. All of the dyes could be
   alkali cleared owing to ionisation of the dye under mild alkaline

Abstract = {{In this paper, we systematically evaluate the variation in the reversal
   delay of a nanomagnet driven by a longitudinal spin current under the
   influence of thermal noise. We then use the results to evaluate the
   performance of an all-spin-logic (ASL) circuit. First, we review and
   expand on the physics of previously published analytical models on
   stochastic nanomagnet switching. The limits of previously established
   models are defined, and it is shown that these models are valid for
   nanomagnet reversal times <200 ps. Second, the insight obtained from
   previous models allows us to represent the probability density function
   (pdf) of the nanomagnet switching delay using the double exponential
   function of the Frechet distribution. The pdf of a single nanomagnet is
   extended to more complex nanomagnet circuit configurations. It is shown
   that the delay-variation penalty incurred by nanomagnets arranged in
   parallel configuration is dwarfed by the average delay increase for
   nanomagnets arranged in a series configuration. Finally, we demonstrate
   the impact of device-level performance variation on the circuit behavior
   using ASL logic gates. While the analysis presented in this paper uses
   an ASL-AND gate as the prototype switching circuit in the spin domain,
   the physical concepts are generic and can be extended to any complex
   spin-based circuit.}},

Abstract = {{The dc-dc modular multilevel converter (MMC), which originated from the
   ac-dc MMC, is an attractive converter topology for the interconnection
   of medium-/high-voltage dc grids. This paper presents design
   considerations for the dc-dc MMC to achieve high efficiency with reduced
   component sizes. A steady-state mathematical model of the dc-dc MMC in
   the phasor domain is developed. Based on the developed model, a design
   approach is proposed to size the components and to select the operating
   frequency of the converter to satisfy a set of design constraints while
   achieving high efficiency. The design approach includes sizing the arm
   inductor, submodule capacitor, and phase filtering inductor along with
   selection of the ac operating frequency of the converter. The accuracy
   of the developed model and the effectiveness of the design approach are
   validated based on the simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software
   environment. The analysis and developments of this paper can be used as
   a guideline for designing the dc-dc MMC.}},

Abstract = {{The effective preconsolidation stress (sigma'(p)) of clay is classically
   determined from one-dimensional consolidation tests on undisturbed
   samples but a first-order approximate value can be estimated from its
   plasticity and water content characteristics. In this paper, initially a
   twofold simple empirical model for predicting sigma'(p) that bifurcates
   at an overconsolidation ratio (OCR) of 3 is developed, and then its
   validity and generality are evaluated using an external (independent)
   validation data set that includes 500 records from 50 different sites.
   The proposed model is accompanied by a discriminant function that uses
   water content and plasticity characteristics to separate soils with OCR
   < 3 (contractive) versus soils with OCR >= 3 (dilative). The results of
   applying the new and existing simple empirical models to the validation
   data set indicate that the predictive capability of the new model is
   quite superior to prior existing approaches that have unacceptable

Abstract = {{A key element for achieving sustainable manufacturing systems is
   efficient and effective resource use. This potentially can be achieved
   by encouraging symbiotic thinking among multiple manufacturers and
   industrial actors and establish resource flow structures that are
   analogous to material flows in natural ecosystems. In this paper,
   ecological principles used by ecologists for understanding food web (FW)
   structures are discussed which can provide new insight for improving
   closed-loop manufacturing networks. Quantitative ecological metrics for
   measuring the performance of natural ecosystems are employed.
   Specifically, cyclicity, which is used by ecologists to measure the
   presence and strength of the internal cycling of materials and energy in
   a system, is discussed. To test applicability, groupings of symbiotic
   eco-industrial parks (EIP) were made in terms of the level of internal
   cycling in the network structure (high, medium, basic, and none) based
   on the metric cyclicity. None of the industrial systems analyzed matched
   the average values and amounts of cycling seen in biological ecosystems.
   Having detritus actors, i.e., active recyclers, is a key element for
   achieving more complex cycling behavior. Higher cyclicity values also
   correspond to higher amounts of indirect cycling and pathway
   proliferation rate, i.e., the rate that the number of paths increases as
   path length increases. In FWs, when significant cycling is present,
   indirect flows dominate direct flows. The application of these
   principles has the potential for novel insights in the context of
   closed-loop manufacturing systems and sustainable manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Neonatal hippocampal lesions in monkeys impairs normal performance on
   both relational and working memory tasks, suggesting that the early
   lesions have impacted the normal development of prefrontal-hippocampal
   functional interactions necessary for normal performance on these tasks.
   Given that working memory processes engage distributed neuronal networks
   associated with the prefrontal cortex, it is critical to explore the
   integrity of distributed neural networks of dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (dIPFC) following neonatal hippocampal lesions in monkeys. We
   used resting-state functional MRI to assess functional connectivity of
   dIPFC networks in monkeys with neonatal neurotoxic hippocampal lesion
   (Neo-Hibo, n = 4) and sham-operated control animals (Neo-C, n = 4).
   Significant differences in the patterns of dIPFC functional networks
   were found between Groups Neo-Hibo and Neo-C. The within-group maps and
   the between-group comparisons yielded a highly coherent picture showing
   altered interactions of core regions of the working memory network
   (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex) as well as the
   dorsal (fundus of superior temporal area and superior temporal cortex)
   and ventral (V4 and infero-temporal cortex) visual processing areas in
   animals with Neo-Hibo lesions. Correlations between functional
   connectivity changes and working memory impairment in the same animals
   were found only between the dIPFC and visual cortical areas (V4 and
   infero-temporal cortex). Thus, the impact of the neonatal hippocampal
   lesions extends to multiple cortical areas interconnected with the
   dlPFC. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{62-74}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Co-fired fly ash, derived from the co-combustion of coal and biomass, is
   examined as a potential precursor for geopolymers. Compared to a coal
   fly ash, two co-fired fly ashes have a lower vitreous content and higher
   carbon content, primarily due to differing combustion processing
   variables. As a result, binders produced with these co-fired fly ashes
   have reduced reaction potential. Nevertheless, compressive strengths are
   generally highest for all ashes activated with solutions with a molar
   ratio of SiO2/(Na2O + K2O) = 1, and these mixes reach the highest extent
   of reaction among those studied. Activation with sodium hydroxide
   solution forms zeolitic phases for all ashes. The thermal and
   dilatometric behavior of the coal and co-fired fly ash geopolymers is
   similar between equivalent mix designs. These results indicate that
   co-fired fly ashes can be viably used to form alkali-activated
   geopolymers, which is a new beneficial end-use for these emerging waste
   materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-physics approach for the assessment of alkali silica reaction
   (ASR) generates new foundational understanding of the nature of the
   reaction, which ultimately can be used for the development of techniques
   and tools for the assessment and monitoring of existing concrete
   structures. The approach combines two nondestructive evaluation
   techniques: (1) nonlinear acoustic measurements, which are sensitive to
   microcracking; and (2) microwave materials characterization
   measurements, which are sensitive to moisture including the transition
   of water from its free state in the pore solution to a bound state
   within accumulating ASR gel. Comparison with assessment of expansion and
   damage rating index obtained from petrographic analysis on standard
   mortar bars shows a correlation between all of the measures.
   Specifically, a strong correlation is found between the cumulative
   average nonlinearity parameter and expansion, and there is also
   agreement of the microwave measurements with the damage rating index.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we first present a comprehensive study of the unique
   thermal behavior in monolithic 3-D integrated circuits (ICs) in contrast
   to through silicon via-based 3-D ICs. In particular, we study the impact
   of the thin interlayer dielectric between the device tiers on vertical
   thermal coupling. We then study and compare the impact of different
   application-based package structures on the thermal behavior of
   monolithic 3-D ICs. With these unique properties and behavior, we
   develop a fast and accurate compact full-chip thermal analysis model
   based on nonlinear regression technique which adapts to the package
   structure during development and hence considers it during temperature
   evaluation. Our model is extremely fast and highly accurate with an
   error of less than 5\%. This model is incorporated into a thermal-aware
   3-D-floorplanner that runs without significant runtime overhead. We use
   the floorplanner with our package-aware thermal model and observe up to
   22\% reduction in the maximum temperature with insignificant area and
   performance overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Congestion is a major issue in transportation sector. As professionals
   in the transportation field are increasingly exploring new solutions to
   alleviate traffic congestion, interest in the use of on-line simulation
   as a tool for estimating metrics of the traffic network for use in
   real-time operations has grown. The goal of the on-line simulation is to
   provide traffic information to facilitate more informed travel decisions
   and enable improved active traffic management. Performance estimation of
   arterials is a particularly challenging problem because it includes
   complexities not present in highways. The results of a sequence of
   experiments are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of a dynamic,
   data-driven, simulation-based system for estimating arterial performance
   measures in real-time. The envisioned system is comprised of a
   microscopic traffic simulation model driven by point sensor data. The
   conceptual framework of the system is presented, highlighting its key
   components. Four iterative applications of the framework are then
   presented, including a proof of concept experiment, two field tests and,
   a pseudo-field test involving origin-destination pairs from the Federal
   Highway Administration (FHWA) next generation simulation dataset. The
   results of the four applications demonstrate the feasibility of
   employing point sensor data to drive a microscopic traffic simulation
   and estimate arterial performance measures in real-time.}},

Title = {{A numerical study of turbulence under temporally evolving axisymmetric
   contraction and subsequent relaxation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{805}},
Pages = {{460-493}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations using up to 40963 grid points on a
   deforming domain have been used to study the response of initially
   isotropic turbulence to a period of spatially uniform axisymmetric
   contraction (with one extensional and two equally compressive
   directions) and subsequent relaxation. A time-dependent strain rate is
   formulated to closely correspond to the downstream evolution in the wind
   tunnel experiments of Ayyalasomayajula \& Warhaft (J. Fluid Mech., vol.
   566, 2006, pp. 273-307), with a smoothly varying 4 : 1 contraction
   ratio. The application of strain leads to anisotropy in both the large
   scales and the small scales, in a manner where nonlinear effects not
   considered in rapid-distortion theory play an important role. Upon
   termination of strain, the small scales quickly return to isotropy while
   a residual level of anisotropy appears to persist at the large scales.
   The simulations are shown to reproduce many key findings from
   experiments, including distinctive changes in the form of the
   one-dimensional spectra in the extensional direction that arise at
   sufficiently high Reynolds number, during both the straining and
   relaxation periods. Scale-dependent measures of anisotropy are presented
   in terms of one-dimensional spectra and axisymmetric versions of the
   energy spectrum. To explain the observed changes in spectral shapes,
   various terms in the spectral evolution equation representing rapid
   pressure strain, slow pressure strain, production, nonlinear transfer
   and viscous dissipation are computed, showing that nonlinear effects
   take a dominant role when a wide range of scales exists. In particular,
   the `double-peak' spectral form observed in experiments at high Reynolds
   number is found to be a consequence of the small scales relaxing towards
   isotropy much faster than the large scales. A comparison of results
   obtained from computational domains of varying sizes and grid
   resolutions show that the numerical findings are robust.}},

Abstract = {{Chord length distributions (CLDs) and lineal path functions (LPFs) have
   been successfully utilized in prior literature as measures of the size
   and shape distributions of the important microscale constituents in the
   material system. Typically, these functions are parameterized only by
   line lengths, and thus calculated and derived independent of the angular
   orientation of the chord or line segment. We describe in this paper
   computationally efficient methods for estimating chord length
   distributions and lineal path functions for 2D (two dimensional) and 3D
   microstructure images defined on any number of arbitrary chord
   orientations. These so called fully angularly resolved distributions can
   be computed for over 1000 orientations on large microstructure images
   (5003 voxels) in minutes on modest hardware. We present these methods as
   new tools for characterizing microstructures in a statistically
   meaningful way.}},

   increased expression of chondrocyte markers and decreased secretion of
   angiogenic factors VEGF-A and FGF2 in comparison to MSCs cultured on
   tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) at one week. MSCs grown on shark ECM
   gels had decreased type-1 collagen mRNA as compared to all other groups.
   Degradation products of the cartilage ECM gels and soluble factors
   released by the matrices increased chondrogenic and decreased angiogenic
   mRNA levels, indicating that the processed ECM retains biochemically
   active proteins that can stimulate chondrogenic differentiation. In
   conclusion, this work supports the use of cartilage matrix-derived
   hydrogels for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and cartilage tissue
   engineering. Longer-term studies and positive controls will be needed to
   support these results to definitively demonstrate stimulation of
   chondrocyte differentiation, and particularly to verify that
   calcification without endochondral ossification does not occur as it
   does in shark cartilage.
   Statement of Significance
   The objectives of this study were to determine if shark and pig
   cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels can stimulate
   chondrocytic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) without
   exogenous growth factors and to determine if the soluble factors
   retained by these ECM hydrogels are responsible for this induction.
   Sharks are an especially interesting model for cartilage regeneration
   because their entire skeleton is composed of cartilage and they do not
   undergo endochondral ossification. Culturing human MSCs on porcine and
   shark cartilage ECM gels directly, with ECM gel conditioned media, or
   degradation products increased mRNA levels of chondrogenic factors while
   decreasing angiogenic factors. These studies indicate that xenogeneic
   cartilage ECMs have potential as biodegradable scaffolds capable of
   stimulating chondrogenesis while preventing angiogenesis for
   regenerative medicine applications and that ECM species selection can
   yield differential effects. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{The salt concentration gradually increases at the soil free surface when
   the evaporation rate exceeds the diffusive counter transport.
   Eventually, salt precipitates and crystals form a porous sodium chloride
   crust with a porosity of 0.43 +/- 0.14. After detaching from soils, the
   salt crust still experiences water condensation and salt deliquescence
   at the bottom, brine transport across the crust driven by the humidity
   gradient, and continued air-side precipitation. This transport mechanism
   allows salt crust migration away from the soil surface at a rate of 5 mu
   m/h forming salt domes above soil surfaces. The surface characteristics
   of mineral substrates and the evaporation rate affect the morphology and
   the crystal size of precipitated salt. In particular, substrate
   hydrophobicity and low evaporation rate suppress salt spreading.}},

Title = {{Thermal analysis of near-isothermal compressed gas energy storage system}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{948-960}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Due to the increasing generation capacity of intermittent renewable
   electricity sources and an electrical grid ill-equipped to handle the
   mismatch between electricity generation and use, the need for advanced
   energy storage technologies will continue to grow. Currently,
   pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage are
   used for grid-scale energy storage, and batteries are used at smaller
   scales. However, prospects for expansion of these technologies suffer
   from geographic limitations (pumped storage hydroelectricity and
   compressed air energy storage), low roundtrip efficiency (compressed air
   energy storage), and high cost (batteries). Furthermore, pumped-storage
   hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage are challenging to
   scale-down, while batteries are challenging to scale-up. In 2015, a
   novel compressed gas energy storage prototype system was developed at
   Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In this paper, a near-isothermal
   modification to the system is proposed. In common with compressed air
   energy storage, the novel storage technology described in this paper is
   based on air compression/expansion. However, several novel features lead
   to near-isothermal processes, higher efficiency, greater system
   scalability, and the ability to site a system anywhere. The enabling
   features are utilization of hydraulic machines for
   expansion/compression, above-ground pressure vessels as the storage
   medium, spray cooling/heating, and waste-heat utilization. The base
   configuration of the novel storage system was introduced in a previous
   paper. This paper describes the results obtained from a transient,
   analytical, physics-based thermodynamic system model used for the system
   design and evaluation of three design configurations (including base
   configuration). The system model captures real gas effects and all loss
   mechanisms. The model demonstrates an energy storage roundtrip
   efficiency of 82\% and energy density of 3.59 MJ/m(3). Experimental
   evaluation of system performance and detailed cost analysis will be
   presented in future publications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Recycling combustion ash for sustainable cement production: A critical
   review with data-mining and time-series predictive models}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Combustion is a complex process that produces energy as the goal and
   ashes as by-products. The ash of coal, biomass. and solid waste
   combustion can be used as pozzolans in blended cement due to the
   similarity of their physiochemical properties to conventional pozzolans
   (e.g. silica fume). This strategy effectively recycles pozzolanic-active
   combustion ash and replaces a significant proportion of Portland cement,
   which potentially reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cement
   production.. However, cement producers wishing to substitute
   pozzolanic-active ash for conventional pozzolans lack information on the
   pozzolanic activity (PA) of ash from diverse combustible materials. A
   data-mining model that can extract key information for predicting the PA
   of combustion ash is envisioned as a screening tool to assess the
   pozzolanic potential of candidate combustible materials prior to
   experimental work. Hence, the objectives of this chapter are, 1) to
   critically review the recent research progress in using various
   combustion ashes as pozzolans, including the mechanism of the pozzolanic
   reaction, sources of eligible materials, and methods of PA improvement,
   2) to create a data-mining artificial neural network (ANN) model for PA
   prediction built upon data reported in the scientific literature from
   1998 to 2015, and 3) to describe the effect of cement curing period on
   PA, based on a time series model. The ANN and time-series models
   developed in this study can accurately forecast the PA of combustion
   ashes during 3-90 d curing (R-2 = 0.8479-0.9914). We recommend these
   screening tools as rapid indicators of the pozzolanic potential of
   combustion ash prior to undertaking strength tests and other
   experimental testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we estimate perceived image quality using sparse
   representations obtained from generic image databases through an
   unsupervised learning approach. A color space transformation, amean
   subtraction, and a whitening operation are used to enhance
   descriptiveness of images by reducing spatial redundancy; a linear
   decoder is used to obtain sparse representations; and a thresholding
   stage is used to formulate suppression mechanisms in a visual system. A
   linear decoder is trained with 7 GB worth of data, which corresponds to
   100 000 8 x 8 image patches randomly obtained from nearly 1000 images in
   the ImageNet 2013 database. A patch-wise training approach is preferred
   to maintain local information. The proposed quality estimator UNIQUE is
   tested on the LIVE, the Multiply Distorted LIVE, and the TID 2013
   databases and compared with 13 quality estimators. Experimental results
   show that UNIQUE is generally a top performing quality estimator in
   terms of accuracy, consistency, linearity, and monotonic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical review of ejector technology for chiller
   applications, combining an understanding of ejector fluid flow
   fundamentals with cycle applications. An ejector is a passive
   momentum-transfer device that requires no external mechanical input or
   moving parts. The progression of studies on ejectors from the early
   1940s to the present from analytical and numerical modeling to
   visualization studies of the ejector itself is discussed. Included is an
   assessment of the most recent computational models. Suggestions for
   future research include improved computational modeling of shock
   phenomena and the effects of two-phase flow in ejectors. Application of
   ejectors in chillers is also reviewed, with an emphasis on the basic
   ejector-based chiller cycle and the development of passive systems that
   require zero mechanical input for operation. Important connections are
   made between ejector component- and system-level studies that would
   together lead to improved overall system performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Design principles are created to codify and formalize design knowledge
   so that innovative, archival practices may be communicated and used to
   advance design science and solve future design problems, especially the
   pinnacle, wicked, and grand-challenge problems that face the world and
   cross-cutting markets. Principles are part of a family of knowledge
   explication, which also include guidelines, heuristics, rules of thumb,
   and strategic constructs. Definitions of a range of explications are
   explored from a number of seminal papers. Based on this analysis, the
   authors pose formalized definitions for the three most prevalent terms
   in the literature-principles, guidelines, and heuristics-and draw more
   definitive distinctions between the terms. Current research methods and
   practices with design principles are categorized and characterized. We
   further explore research methodologies, validation approaches, semantic
   principle composition through computational analysis, and a proposed
   formal approach to articulating principles. In analyzing the methodology
   for discovering, deriving, formulating, and validating design
   principles, the goal is to understand and advance the theoretical basis
   of design, the foundations of new tools and techniques, and the complex
   systems of the future. Suggestions for the future of design principles
   research methodology for added rigor and repeatability are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Three eutectic salts from a system of halide salts NaCl-KCl-ZnCl2 were

   presented here for the three candidate eutectic salts, including melting
   point, heat of fusion, heat capacity, vapor pressure, viscosity,
   density, and thermal conductivity. Data-fitted equations are provided
   for all the measured properties for convenience in engineering
   application. It is concluded that the three eutectic salts can satisfy

Title = {{A Fractional Calculus Model of Viscoelastic Stator Supports Coupled With
   Elastic Rotor-Stator Rub}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRIBOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Rotating machinery is inherently susceptible to costly and dangerous
   faults. One such commonly encountered fault is undesirable dynamic
   contact between the rotor and stator (i.e., rotor-stator rub). The
   forces generated during rotor-stator rub are fundamentally tribological,
   as they are generated by contact and friction and result in wear. These
   forces are typically found by assuming linear elastic contact and dry
   Coulomb friction at the rotor-stator interface, where the normal force
   is a linear function of the interference. For the first time, this work
   incorporates viscoelasticity into the stator support and investigates
   its influence on the global dynamics of rotor-stator rub. The
   viscoelastic stator supports are modeled using fractional calculus, an
   approach which adeptly and robustly characterizes the viscoelasticity.
   Specifically, a fractional derivative order of one-half is employed to
   generate an analytic time-domain form of viscoelastic impedance. This
   approach directly assimilates viscoelasticity into the system dynamics,
   since the rotor equations of motion are integrated numerically in the
   time-domain. The coupled rotor-stator dynamic model incorporating
   viscoelastic supports is solved numerically to explore the influence of
   viscoelasticity. This model provides a framework for analysis of dynamic
   systems where viscoelasticity is included.}},

Title = {{Rough Surface Contact of Curved Conformal Surfaces: An Application to
   Rotor-Stator Rub}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRIBOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Rotating machines and associated triboelements are ubiquitous in
   industrial society, playing a central role in power generation,
   transportation, and manufacturing. Unfortunately, these systems are
   susceptible to undesirable contact (i.e., rub) between the rotor and
   stator, which is both costly and dangerous. These adverse effects can be
   alleviated by properly applying accurate real-time diagnostics. The
   first step toward accurate diagnostics is developing rotor-stator rub
   models which appropriately emulate reality. Previous rotor-stator rub
   models disavow the contact physics by reducing the problem to a single
   esoteric linear contact stiffness occurring only at the point of maximum
   rotor radial deflection. Further, the contact stiffness is typically
   chosen arbitrarily, and as such provides no additional insight into the
   contacting surfaces. Here, a novel rotor-stator rub model is developed
   by treating the strongly conformal curved surfaces according to their
   actual nature: a collection of stochastically distributed asperities.
   Such an approach is advantageous in that it relies on real surface
   measurements to quantify the contact force rather than a heuristic
   choice of linear contact stiffness. Specifically, the elastoplastic
   Jackson-Green (JG) rough surface contact model is used to obtain the
   quasistatic contact force versus rotor radial deflection; differences
   and similarities in contact force between the linear elastic contact
   model (LECM) and JG model are discussed. Furthermore, the linear elastic
   model's point contact assumption is assessed and found to be inaccurate
   for systems with small clearances. Finally, to aid in computational
   efficiency in future rotordynamic simulation, a simple exponential curve
   fit is proposed to approximate the JG force-displacement relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammation and altered glutamate metabolism are two pathways
   implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Interestingly, these
   pathways may be linked given that administration of inflammatory
   cytokines such as interferon-a to otherwise nondepressed controls
   increased glutamate in the basal ganglia and dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex (dACC) as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
   Whether increased inflammation is associated with increased glutamate
   among patients with major depression is unknown. Accordingly, we
   conducted a cross-sectional study of 50 medication-free, depressed
   outpatients using single-voxel MRS, to measure absolute glutamate
   concentrations in basal ganglia and dACC. Multivoxel chemical shift
   imaging (CSI) was used to explore creatine-normalized measures of other
   metabolites in basal ganglia. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   inflammatory markers were assessed along with anhedonia and psychomotor
   speed. Increased log plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly
   associated with increased log left basal ganglia glutamate controlling
   for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking status and depression
   severity. In turn, log left basal ganglia glutamate was associated with
   anhedonia and psychomotor slowing measured by the finger-tapping test,
   simple reaction time task and the Digit Symbol Substitution Task. Plasma
   CRP was not associated with dACC glutamate. Plasma and CSF CRP were also
   associated with CSI measures of basal ganglia glutamate and the glial
   marker myoinositol. These data indicate that increased inflammation in
   major depression may lead to increased glutamate in the basal ganglia in
   association with glial dysfunction and suggest that therapeutic
   strategies targeting glutamate may be preferentially effective in
   depressed patients with increased inflammation as measured by CRP.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is associated with alterations in corticostriatal reward
   circuitry. One pathophysiological pathway that may drive these changes
   is inflammation. Biomarkers of inflammation (for example, cytokines and
   C-reactive protein (CRP)) are reliably elevated in depressed patients.
   Moreover, administration of inflammatory stimuli reduces neural activity
   and dopamine release in reward-related brain regions in association with
   reduced motivation and anhedonia. Accordingly, we examined whether
   increased inflammation in depression affects corticostriatal reward
   circuitry to lead to deficits in motivation and goal-directed motor
   behavior. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was
   conducted on 48 medically stable, unmedicated outpatients with major
   depression. Whole-brain, voxel-wise functional connectivity was examined
   as a function of CRP using seeds for subdivisions of the ventral and
   dorsal striatum associated with motivation and motor control. Increased
   CRP was associated with decreased connectivity between ventral striatum
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (corrected P < 0.05), which
   in turn correlated with increased anhedonia (R = -0.47, P = 0.001).
   Increased CRP similarly predicted decreased dorsal striatal to vmPFC and
   presupplementary motor area connectivity, which correlated with
   decreased motor speed (R = 0.31 to 0.45, P < 0.05) and increased
   psychomotor slowing (R = -0.35, P = 0.015). Of note, mediation analyses
   revealed that these effects of CRP on connectivity mediated significant
   relationships between CRP and anhedonia and motor slowing. Finally,
   connectivity between striatum and vmPFC was associated with increased
   plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist (R =
   -0.33 to -0.36, P < 0.05). These findings suggest that decreased
   corticostriatal connectivity may serve as a target for anti-inflammatory
   or pro-dopaminergic treatment strategies to improve motivational and
   motor deficits in patients with increased inflammation, including
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising cell source for
   regenerative medicine, but their derivatives need to be rigorously
   evaluated for residual stem cells to prevent teratoma formation. Here,
   we report the development of novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS)-based assays that can detect trace numbers of undifferentiated
   hPSCs in mixed cell populations in a highly specific, ultra sensitive,
   and time-efficient manner. By targeting stem cell surface markers SSEA-5
   and TRA-1-60 individually or simultaneously, these SERS assays were able
   to identify as few as I stem cell in 106 cells, a sensitivity (0.0001\%)
   which was 2000 to 15,000-fold higher than that of flow cytometry assays.
   Using the SERS assay, we demonstrate that the aggregation of hPSC-based
   cardiomyocyte differentiation cultures into 3D spheres significantly
   reduced SSEA-5+ and TRA-1-60+ cells compared with parallel 2D cultures.
   Thus, SERS may provide a powerful new technology for quality control of
   hPSC-derived products for preclinical and clinical applications. (C)

Title = {{Assessing impacts of a learning-cycle-based module on students'
   conceptual sustainability knowledge using concept maps and surveys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{As engineers will be the designers of projects that will have lasting
   economic, environmental, and social impacts, it is important to ensure
   that students are equipped with the necessary conceptual knowledge to
   engage in sustainable design. Reforms in engineering education are
   needed to ensure that sustain ability content is included in
   undergraduate curricula. In addition, previous work has demonstrated
   that beyond curricular content, innovative pedagogical approaches are
   also important for enhancing student learning. The goal of this work was
   to examine the impacts of a learning-cycle-based sustainability module
   on students' conceptual understanding of sustainability. The module was
   integrated into a senior-level, civil and environmental engineering
   capstone design course at a large, research-intensive university in the
   southeastern United States. Concept maps and student self-report surveys
   were used to compare learning gains for students in the modified design
   course (intervention cohort) to those in the traditional design course
   (control cohort). Concept map results indicated that improvements in
   knowledge depth, breadth, and interconnectedness were significantly
   greater for the intervention, as compared to the control cohort.
   Furthermore, while both cohorts initially over-emphasized the
   environmental dimension of sustainability, only those students in the
   intervention cohort demonstrated a more balanced understanding of
   sustainability at the end of the course. Survey results did not show the
   significant learning gains seen in concept maps, but it is expected that
   students' survey responses were biased by their negative perceptions of
   the module itself at the end of the semester. Future module
   implementations, which can be adapted for a variety of engineering and
   even non-engineering disciplines, should ensure more complete
   integration into the target course to improve student perceptions of the
   learning experience. Overall, this study provides
   theoretically-grounded, empirically-tested learning materials and
   assessment methods than can be adapted in other engineering courses. (C)

Abstract = {{We study the problem of scheduling maintenance on arcs of a capacitated
   network so as to maximize the total flow from a source node to a sink
   node over a set of time periods. Maintenance on an arc shuts down the
   arc for the duration of the period in which its maintenance is
   scheduled, making its capacity zero for that period. A set of arcs is
   designated to have maintenance during the planning period, which will
   require each to be shut down for exactly one time period. In general
   this problem is known to be NP-hard, and several special instance
   classes have been studied. Here we propose an additional constraint
   which limits the number of maintenance jobs per time period, and we
   study the impact of this on the complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent emphasis on the pilot scale production of cellulosic
   nanomaterials has increased interest in the effective use of these
   materials as reinforcements for polymer composites. An important,
   enabling step to realizing the potential of cellulosic nanomaterials in
   their applications is the materials processing of CNC/polymer composites
   through multiple routes, i.e. melt, solution, and aqueous processing
   methods. Therefore, the objective of this research is to characterize
   the viscoelastic behavior of aqueous nanocomposite suspensions
   containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and a water-soluble polymer,
   poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Specifically, small amplitude oscillatory
   shear measurements were performed on neat PVA solutions and CNC-loaded
   PVA suspensions. The experimental results indicated that the methods
   used in this study were able to produce high-quality nanocomposite
   suspensions at high CNC loadings, up to 67 wt\% with respect to PVA.
   Additionally, the structure achieved in the nanocomposite suspensions
   was understood through component attributes and interactions. At CNC
   loadings near and less than the percolation threshold, a polymer
   mediated CNC network was present. At loadings well above the percolation
   threshold, a CNC network was present, indicated by limited molecular
   weight dependence of the storage modulus. Overall, these results provide
   increased fundamental understanding of CNC/PVA suspensions that can be
   leveraged to develop advanced aqueous processing methods for these
   materials.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{43-59}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper models concrete's resistance to cyclic freeze/thaw using the
   solution of the poromechanical problem, which describes the freezing of
   an individual air void surrounded by hydrated cement paste. This enables
   calculation of the pore pressures and the volume of water expelled into
   the air void upon freezing. The model was applied to concrete specimens
   with entrained air voids with polydispersity in size, and subjected to
   water absorption, thereby simulating a cyclic freeze/thaw laboratory
   test. The mean and maximum pore pressures obtained by the simulation
   were compared to a series of experimental tests per ASTM C666, and
   results suggest the model may be used to predict satisfactory durability
   in the laboratory test. This framework may be useful tool to study the
   effects of porespace and entrained air void size distribution on
   concrete's freeze/thaw durability. Furthermore, it allows for a
   theoretical basis for assessing the entrained air void system
   parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   generally rely on the presence of high contrast in thermal conductivity
   between constituent materials. Even though this might result in
   topological configurations that are optimal according to some desired
   thermal metric, the resulting systems might be impractical from a
   mechanical standpoint: high contrast in thermal conductivity generally
   translates into disparate ranges of thermal expansion, which in turn may
   lead to mechanical failure. In this paper, we focus on the combination
   of multi-scale modeling and topology optimization techniques for the
   design of polycrystalline single-material systems with enhanced thermal
   transport properties. Spatial variation of the length-dependent thermal
   conductivity is achieved by grading the characteristic grain size of the
   microstructure. We adopt a multi-scale approach to compute the
   attainable range of thermal conductivity due to grain-size effect, given
   maximum and minimum grain sizes and an operating temperature range.
   Then, we utilize an adaptive topology optimization technique to obtain
   an optimal grain size distribution, while accounting for manufacturing
   constraints. Through a series of specific examples, we demonstrate the
   extent to which thermal transport properties can be optimized without
   resorting to the adoption of multi-material systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this two-part study, a comprehensive investigation of the
   condensation of pure and zeotropic mixtures of ammonia and ammonia/water
   is conducted and improved models for condensation are developed. In Part
   I, condensation heat transfer experiments were conducted on ammonia and
   ammonia/water mixtures. Data for pure ammonia were obtained for varying
   tube diameters (0.98 < D < 2.16 mm), mass fluxes (75 < G < 225 kg m(2)
   s(-1)), and saturation conditions (30 < T-sat < 60 degrees C).
   Experiments on zeotropic ammonia/water mixtures were conducted for
   multiple tube diameters (0.98 < D < 2.16 mm), mass fluxes (50 < G < 200
   kg m(-2) s(-1)), and bulk ammonia mass fractions (x(bulk) = 0.8, 0.9 and
   >0.96). For zeotropic mixtures, the apparent heat transfer coefficient
   showed a different trend from the pure ammonia heat transfer
   coefficient, with strong degradation observed in quality ranges with
   large temperature glides. At low quality ranges (i.e., low temperature
   glides and smaller mixture effects), the pure ammonia heat transfer
   coefficient and zeotropic mixture apparent heat transfer coefficient
   were in good agreement. In Part II of this study, a new model for
   predicting condensation heat transfer for pure ammonia in mini- and
   microchannels is introduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A continuum model is developed for hexagonal lattices, composed of a set
   of masses connected by linear axial and angular springs, with
   nonlinearity arising solely from geometric effects. For a set of lattice
   parameters, these lattices exhibit complex deformation patterns under
   uniform loading conditions due to instabilities. A continuum model
   accounting for these instabilities is developed from explicit
   expressions of the potential energy functional of a unit cell. This
   functional is non-convex, it captures the bistable nature of the
   lattice, and is used to derive its effective constitutive behavior.
   Finite element simulations of continuum medium illustrate the formation
   of microstructural patterns with discontinuous displacement gradients,
   similar to the features observed in nonlinear elasticity and finite
   deformation plasticity. A comparison of discrete lattice simulations and
   finite element analysis under general loading conditions illustrates
   that the continuum model captures the effective behavior due to
   instabilities within the lattice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many experimental biological techniques utilize hollow glass needles
   called micropipettes to perform fluid extraction, cell manipulation, and
   electrophysiological recordings. For electrophysiological recordings,
   micropipettes are typically fabricated immediately before use using a
   ``pipette puller{''}, which uses open-loop control to heat a hollow
   glass capillary while applying a tensile load. Variability between
   manufactured micropipettes requires a highly trained operator to
   qualitatively inspect each micropipette; typically this is achieved by
   viewing the pipette under 40-100x magnification in order to ensure that
   the tip has the correct shape (e.g., outer diameter, cone angle, taper
   length). Since laboratories may use hundreds of micropipettes per week,
   significant time demands are associated with micropipette inspection.
   Here, we have automated the measurement of micropipette tip outer
   diameter and cone angle using optical microscopy. The process features
   repeatable constraint of the micropipette, quickly and automatically
   moving the micropipette to bring its tip into the field of view,
   focusing on the tip, and computing tip outer diameter and cone angle
   measurements from the acquired images by applying a series of image
   processing algorithms. As implemented on a custom automated microscope,
   these methods achieved, with 95\% confidence, +/- 0.38 mu m
   repeatability in outer diameter measurement and +/- 5.45 degrees
   repeatability in cone angle measurement, comparable to a trained human
   operator. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing optical pipette
   measurements with measurements obtained using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM); optical outer diameter measurements differed from SEM
   by 0.35 +/- 0.36 mu m and optical cone angle measurements differed from
   SEM by -0.23 +/- 232. The algorithms we developed are adaptable to most
   commercial automated microscopes and provide a skill-free route to
   rapid, quantitative measurement of pipette tip geometry with high
   resolution, accuracy, and repeatability. Further, these methods are an
   important step toward a closed-loop, fully-automated micropipette
   fabrication system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{N-Halogenated amines or `halamines' have attracted recent attention as
   potential biocides for materials and surface coatings application.
   Facile N-chlorination of the hindered amine light stabiliser (HALS)
   Tinuvin (R) 770, bis-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl), sebacate, was
   achieved by reaction with sodium dichloroisocyanurate. The chlorinated
   product was incorporated into a polyester-based paint formulated for
   coil coating, applied to test panels and subjected to high temperature
   curing conditions characteristic of the coil coating process (55 s at
   262 degrees C). Rapid detection of N-chlorinated Tinuvin (R) 770 in the
   cured coating was confirmed, using liquid extraction surface
   analysis-mass spectrometry, by the characteristic fragmentation patterns
   of the halamines observed upon collision-induced dissociation.
   Antimicrobial activity of the coating was determined by testing against
   the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus Cladosporium sp.,
   two organisms that are known to colonise both internal and external
   surfaces in building and cladding applications. The activity of HALS and
   halamine containing coatings were compared against a commercial product
   containing an antimicrobial additive as well as control surfaces without
   additives. Significant activity against the bacterium, but not against
   the fungus was demonstrated for the parent HALS and halamine containing
   coatings. The possibility of regeneration of the halamines was also
   tested and confirmed by mass spectrometry, post-chlorination of samples
   showed no significant differences in activity between corresponding
   pairs of samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to develop seismic fragility curves
   for deteriorating highway bridges by uniquely accounting for realistic
   pitting corrosion deterioration and time-dependent capacity
   distributions for reinforced concrete columns under chloride attacks.
   The proposed framework offers distinct improvements over
   state-of-the-art procedures for fragility assessment of degrading
   bridges which typically assume simplified uniform corrosion
   deterioration model and pristine limit state capacities. Depending on
   the time in service life and deterioration mechanism, this study finds
   that capacity limit states for deteriorating bridge columns follow
   either lognormal distribution or generalized extreme value distributions
   (particularly for pitting corrosion). Impact of column degradation
   mechanism on seismic response and fragility of bridge components and
   system is assessed using nonlinear time history analysis of
   three-dimensional finite element bridge models reflecting the
   uncertainties across structural modeling parameters, deterioration
   parameters and ground motion. Comparisons are drawn between the proposed
   methodology and traditional approaches to develop aging bridge fragility
   curves. Results indicate considerable underestimations of system level
   fragility across different damage states using the traditional approach
   compared to the proposed realistic pitting model for chloride induced
   corrosion. Time-dependent predictive functions are provided to
   interpolate logistic regression coefficients for continuous seismic
   reliability evaluation along the service life with reasonable accuracy.

Abstract = {{The bowing of edge dislocations from a row of collinear obstacles in Al
   is studied using concurrent atomistic-continuum simulations of
   submicron-sized realizations containing up to 238 million atoms. Results
   show that (1) as the number of adjacent bowed-out dislocation segments
   increases, the critical dislocation depinning stress approaches that for
   an infinite array of obstacles and (2) for the unstable overall
   semi-elliptic dislocation configuration, the presence of intermediate
   obstacles reduces the dislocation half-loop height, but doesn't affect
   the critical shear stress. Our work highlights the significance of the
   effects of adjacent bowed-out segments on cooperative dislocation
   bow-out. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multiaxis machining (e.g., milling) of large aerospace structures is
   typically carried out using large monument scale expensive computer
   numerical control (CNC) machine tools. In contrast, multiple
   degree-of-freedom-articulated robotic arm-based machining has several
   potential advantages over CNC machine tools, owing to its flexibility
   (reconfigurability) and lower cost. However, its application is limited
   by its much lower stiffness and accuracy compared with a CNC machine
   tool. This paper presents a new method that combines wireless force
   sensing with a mechanistic model of the milling process to increase the
   accuracy of robotic milling while preserving its flexibility.
   Articulated-arm robotic milling experiments are conducted to validate
   the concept. Experimental results show significant improvement (>70\%)
   in the dimensional accuracy of simple geometric features machined using
   the new method.}},

Abstract = {{GaN p-i-n ultraviolet avalanche photodiodes (UV-APDs) were fabricated
   from epitaxial structures grown on low-dislocation-density free-standing
   GaN substrates to form 4x4 UV-APD arrays with a device size of 75x75 mu
   m(2). The devices in the UV-APD array showed a uniform and reliable
   distribution of breakdown voltage (V-BR) and leakage current density.
   The average VBR of the 16 devices in one of the UV-APD arrays was 96 +/-
   0.6 V, and the average dark current density (J(R\_Dark)) and
   photocurrent density (J(R\_Photo)) were measured to be (6.5 +/- 1.8) x
   10(-7) and (5.7 +/- 1.1) x10(-6) A/cm(2) at the reverse bias voltage of
   V-R = 48 V (50\% of the average onset point of V-BR), respectively. The
   reliable device performance was confirmed by performing multiple reverse
   bias I-V scans for the selected devices in the UV-APD array. We also
   observed the significantly enhanced spectral responsivity from the 142
   to 5485 mA/W due to the strong carrier impact ionization at high reverse

Abstract = {{We report high-responsivity GaN/InGaN heterojunction phototransistors
   (HPTs) grown on sapphire substrates. Under the ultraviolet (UV) photon
   illumination from the front side of the wafer, an HPT shows broad
   photoresponse spectrum with the short-wavelength cutoff wavelength well
   beyond lambda = 280 nm, and the UV-to-visible-band rejection ratio is >8
   x 10(3). The responsivity (R-lambda) of HPT is greater than 8 A/W at
   lambda = 373 nm, and is greater than 3 A/W at lambda = 280 nm as the
   device is biased at V-CE = 10 V. As the HPT is biased at the near
   breakdown voltage (V-CE > 35 V), the responsivity performance was
   enhanced due to the carrier multiplication, resulting in R-lambda > 100
   A/W at V-CE = 40 V for P-opt = 1.73 mu W/cm(2) at lambda = 373 nm. These
   results demonstrate that GaN/InGaN HPTs can achieve low light detection

   planning: Automated scaffolding-related safety hazard identification and
   prevention in BIM}},

Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{128-142}},

Abstract = {{Construction remains as a hazardous industry that can expose
   construction workers to fatal accidents and illnesses. With recent
   advances in BIM technology, project information in BIM can be analyzed
   in the early design and planning stages to address potential safety
   issues. However, despite the impact on safety and productivity of the
   entire construction project, temporary structures, such as formwork and
   scaffolds, are often omitted from drawings or BIM. In practice, it is
   challenging to consider temporary structures in current manual jobsite
   safety analysis which is time-consuming and error-prone. As a result, in
   construction plans, potential safety hazards related to temporary
   structures are unknowingly created which need to be identified and
   prevented during the construction phases. Focusing on scaffolds, this
   research integrates temporary structures into automated safety checking
   approach using BIM. A safety planning platform was created to simulate
   and visualize spatial movements of work crews using scaffolding.
   Computational algorithms in the platform automatically identify safety
   hazards related to activities working on scaffolding and preventive
   measures can be prepared before the construction begins. The algorithms
   were implemented in a commercially available BIM software as a plug-in
   and validated with a real-world construction project The results show
   that the algorithms could identify safety hazards that were not noticed
   by project managers participating in the case study project The
   simulated results are visualized in the developed safety planning
   platform to potentially facilitate early safety communications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to explore the potential use of Polyamide 6
   nanocomposite reinforced with nanocrystalline (nc) Fe20Ni80 alloy
   (Fe20Ni80/PA6 PNC) in electromagnetic applications and provide
   understanding of how the alloy particle geometry is controlling the
   nanocomposite's physical properties. Thermomechanical rigidity,
   room-temperature soft magnetic performance and thermal soft magnetic
   stability of Fe20Ni80/PA6 PNCs based on spherical-sea urchin alloy
   particles (UMB2-SU) and necklace-like alloy chains (UMB2-NC) have been
   investigated. Both PNCs have considerably superior bulk properties
   compared to neat PA6 and UMB2-SU exhibits the most remarkable overall
   performance. Morphological observations disclose two relevant phenomena:
   i) improved dispersion and distribution of the SU alloy particles than
   the NC ones within PA6 matrix, leading to stronger filler-matrix
   interfacial interactions within the UMB2-SU as compared to the UMB2-NC
   and ii) presence of constraint polymer regions in between alloy segments
   within the UMB2-SU that provide secondary reinforcing and soft magnetic
   mechanisms. Such phenomena along with the lower alloy crystallite size
   and PA6 gamma-crystal type content within the UMB2-SU than in the
   UMB2-NC, are considered the main responsible factors for the distinctive
   performance of UMB2-SU. Overall, compared to various ferromagnetic
   nanocrystalline metallic materials, the research proposes the SU nc
   Fe20Ni80 alloy as a valuable nanofiller in polymers for electromagnetic

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{268-276}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A novel method for the optimization of the microstructure of a two-phase
   solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC)
   cathode is presented. Two-point correlation functions (TPCFs) are used
   to manipulate the microstructure. At first, using an appropriate
   function, such as a decaying exponential multiplied by a sinusoidal
   function, initial full-set TPCFs are created. Based on the created
   TPCFs, a phase recovery algorithm is used, as a construction tool, to
   realize the three-dimensional (3D) porous microstructure of the SOFC.
   The reconstructed microstructures are evaluated based on the
   contribution of the geometrical attributes, such as tortuosity of the
   solid-phase and the active interfacial area, minimizing the cathode
   characteristic impedance. Shooting for a minimum solid-phase tortuosity
   and maximum active interfacial area of solid- and void-phase for a fixed
   volume fraction, a series of optimization simulations are carried out
   using two independent variables of autocovariance function as the design
   variables. Using this approach, it is possible to create very thick (or
   thin) pathways in the solid and void phases with small (or large)
   tortuosity and low (or high) interfacial area of the solid- void by
   applying various TPCF sets. By comparing the present results with some
   of the experimental ones reported in the literature, it is shown that
   the optimization process presented here can be used as a robust tool to
   design optimal microstructure with improved tortuosity and interfacial
   area for SOFCs and other similar bicontinuous applications. (C) 2016

Title = {{Model-based design and experimental validation of simulated moving bed

Abstract = {{This work proposes a practical and systematic model-based approach to
   identify the optimal operating conditions for a simulated moving bed
   reactor (SMBR). The SMBR operation is applied to an industrial case
   study for the continuous production of a solvent, propylene glycol
   methyl ether acetate (DOWANOL (TM) PMA), which is produced through an
   acid-catalyzed esterification reaction of 1-methoxy-2-propanol and
   acetic acid.
   The model-based approach is demonstrated by lab-scale SMBR experiments.
   A multi-objective optimization problem was formulated for developing an
   SMBR process to maximize the production rate of PMA and the conversion
   of the esterification reaction simultaneously. In this study, this
   optimization problem is solved using the epsilon-constrained method and
   a Pareto plot is presented. The solutions that corresponded to three
   different values of conversion, 70\%, 80\%, and 85\%, are experimentally
   validated. The SMBR model that was developed from batch kinetic and
   single column chromatography experiments demonstrates reasonable
   agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the SMBR
   experimental data was used to correct the parameters in the model. A
   validation study at a higher conversion of 95\% demonstrates improved
   predictability of the corrected parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{CPTu-based enhanced UniCone method for pile capacity}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{21-34}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{The UniCone direct piezocone method by Eslami and Fellenius (1997) for
   evaluating the axial capacity of pile foundations is reviewed and
   improved means of evaluating the soil resistance factors are
   recommended. This method uses all three piezocone penetration test
   (CPTu) readings in a soil behavioral type (SBT) classification chart and
   provides estimations of axial pile capacity for a wide variety of pile
   types installed in different assortments of geomaterials. In this paper,
   the earlier method is improved using a dataset of 153 pile load tests
   and CPTu soundings from 52 worldwide sites. An alternative soil
   classification system using the CPT material index is used to provide
   improved correlations of higher reliability via continuous functions for
   estimating the side and base capacity components of driven and jacked
   piles, and drilled shafts. An analysis is also included to test the
   performance of the newly proposed design formulations. Finally, a
   simplified flowchart is presented for convenient application of the
   enhanced expressions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive chromatography using an anion exchange resin is proposed for a
   transesterification reaction of propylene glycol methyl ether (DOWANOL
   (TM) PM) with ethyl acetate to produce propylene glycol methyl ether
   acetate (DOWANOL (TM) PMA). This reaction is studied in batch and
   chromatographic reactors catalyzed by an anion exchange resin. Several
   anion exchange resins are tested and compared based on the performance
   of resin as an adsorbent and a catalyst. A chromatographic column is
   packed with a selected catalyst, AMBERLITE (TM) IRA904, and both
   reaction and chromatographic elution are studied at different
   temperatures and feed concentrations. The resulting chromatograms are
   fitted to a mathematical model to obtain adsorption equilibrium and
   reaction kinetic parameters by the inverse method. Compared to
   esterification investigated in a previous study, transesterification has
   advantages such as a higher conversion at lower temperature and easy
   removal of the byproduct which may lead to higher productivity.
   Deactivation of anion exchange resins is observed and potential
   solutions are suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we investigate the feasibility of using a liquid plasma spray
   process as a novel method for the cost-effective fabrication of a
   nanonetwork of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and
   Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (GDC) composite as a high-performance cathode for
   intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. A suspension containing
   well-dispersed nanosized GDC particles in an LSCF precursor solution is
   designed as the feedstock. The effects of GDC concentration in the
   suspension on the phase composition, microstructure, and electrochemical
   performance of the resulting cathode are studied. When the GDC
   concentration increases to 15 g L-1, the nanosized GDC particles
   distribute uniformly and continuously on the LSCF backbone to form a
   porous network structure. The electrochemical studies further indicate
   that the cathode polarization decreased with the increase in GDC
   concentration from 0 g L-1 to 15 g L-1, whereas a further increase in
   the GDC concentration increases the cathode polarization instead. At 600
   and 750 degrees C, the cathode prepared using 15 g L-1 GDC concentration
   exhibits an impressive area-specific polarization resistance (R-p) of
   0.1 Omega cm(2) and 0.009 Omega cm(2), respectively. Finally, the R-p of
   the optimal cathode almost does not change after the isothermal dwelling
   at 650 degrees C for 350 h. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first IceCube search for a signal of dark matter
   annihilations in the Milky Way using all-flavour neutrino-induced
   particle cascades. The analysis focuses on the DeepCore sub-detector of
   IceCube, and uses the surrounding IceCube strings as a veto region in
   order to select starting events in the DeepCore volume. We use 329
   live-days of data from IceCube operating in its 86-string configuration
   during 2011-2012. No neutrino excess is found, the final result being
   compatible with the background-only hypothesis. From this null result,
   we derive upper limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation
   cross-section, , for dark matter candidate masses ranging from 30 GeV up
   to 10 TeV, assuming both a cuspy and a flat-cored dark matter halo
   profile. For dark matter masses between 200 GeV and 10 TeV, the results
   improve on all previous IceCube results on , reaching a level of 10 cm
   s, depending on the annihilation channel assumed, for a cusped NFW
   profile. The analysis demonstrates that all-flavour searches are
   competitive with muon channel searches despite the intrinsically worse
   angular resolution of cascades compared to muon tracks in IceCube.}},

Abstract = {{Propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) separations are performed on a large scale
   by energy-intensive distillation processes. Membranes based on
   metalorganic framework (MOF) molecular sieves, such as zeolitic
   imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), offer the potential to perform these
   separations at considerably lower cost. However, the fabrication of
   scalable ZIF-8 membranes with high performance at elevated pressures and
   temperatures is challenging. We report the fabrication of high-quality
   ZIF-8 hollow fiber membranes in engineered polymeric hollow fibers via
   the interfacial microfluidic membrane processing (IMMP) technique.
   Control of fiber microstructure, as well as optimization of IMMP
   conditions, allow us to achieve a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 180 (at
   1 bar and 25 degrees C), which remains high (60) at 120 degrees C.
   Furthermore, high-pressure operation of these membranes was
   investigated. Detailed permeation measurements indicate excellent
   suppression of defects at higher pressures up to 9.5 bar, allowing a
   C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 90 at 9.5 bar. The membranes also display
   a 4-fold increase in flux at 9.5 bar as compared to operation at 1 bar.
   The long-term stability of the ZIF-8 hollow fiber membranes is
   demonstrated by continuous operation over a month without loss of C3H6
   permeance or selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of recent work has demonstrated that the thermal
   conductivity of polymers can be improved dramatically through the
   alignment of polymer chains in the direction of heat transfer. Most of
   the polymeric samples exhibit high conductivity in either the axial
   direction of a fiber or in the in-plane direction of a thin film, while
   the most useful direction for thermal management is often the
   cross-plane direction of a film. Here we show poly(3-methylthiophene)
   brushes grafted from phosphonic acid monolayers using surface initiated
   polymerization can exhibit through-plane thermal conductivity greater
   than 2 Wi(m K), a 6-fold increase compared to spin-coated
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) samples. The thickness of these films (1040 nm)
   is somewhat less than that required in most applications, but the method
   demonstrates a route toward higher thermal conductivity in covalently
   grafted, aligned polymer films.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving structurally well-defined catalytic species requires a
   fundamental understanding of surface chemistry. Detailed structural
   characterization of the catalyst binding sites in situ, such as single
   site catalysts on silica supports, is technically challenging or even
   unattainable. Octadecyltrioxysilane (OTOS) monolayers formed from
   octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) at the air-liquid interface after
   hydrolysis and condensation at low pH were chosen as a model system of
   surface binding sites in silica-supported Zn2+ catalysts. We
   characterize the system by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, X-ray
   reflectivity (XR), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XFS). Previous
   X-ray and infrared surface studies of OTMS/OTOS films at the airliquid
   interface proposed the formation of polymer OTOS structures. According
   to our analysis, polymer formation is inconsistent with the X-ray
   observations and structural properties of siloxanes; it is energetically
   unfavorable and thus highly unlikely. We suggest an alternative
   mechanism of hydrolysis/condensation in OTMS leading to the formation of
   structurally allowed cyclic trimers with the six-membered siloxane
   rings, which explain well both the X-ray and infrared results. XR and
   XFS consistently demonstrate that tetrahedral {[}Zn(NH3)(4)](2+) ions
   bind to hydroxyl groups of the film at a stoichiometric ratio of OTOS:Zn
   similar to 2:1. The high binding affinity of zinc ions to OTOS trimers
   suggests that the six-membered siloxane rings are binding locations for
   single site Zn/SiO2 catalysts. Our results show that OTOS monolayers may
   serve as a platform for studying silica surface chemistry or
   hydroxyl-mediated reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving mastery over the synthesis of metal nanocrystals has emerged
   as one of the foremost scientific endeavors in recent years. This
   intense interest stems from the fact that the composition, size, and
   shape of nanocrystals not only define their overall physicochemical
   properties but also determine their effectiveness in technologically
   important applications. Our aim is to present a comprehensive review of
   recent research activities on bimetallic nanocrystals. We begin with a
   brief introduction to the architectural diversity of bimetallic
   nanocrystals, followed by discussion of the various synthetic techniques
   necessary for controlling the elemental ratio and spatial arrangement.
   We have selected key examples from the literature that exemplify
   critical concepts and place a special emphasis on mechanistic
   understanding. We then discuss the composition-dependent properties of
   bimetallic nanocrystals in terms of catalysis, optics, and magnetism and
   conclude the Review by highlighting applications that have been enabled
   and/or enhanced by precisely controlling the synthesis of bimetallic
   nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes with high energy density
   and excellent cycling stability is still a great challenge. A carbon
   aerogel, possessing a hierarchical porous structure, high specific
   surface area and electrical conductivity, is an ideal backbone to
   support transition metal oxides and bring hope to prepare electrodes
   with high energy density and excellent cycling stability. Therefore,
   NiCo2S4 nanotube array/carbon aerogel and NiCo2O4 nanoneedle
   array/carbon aerogel hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials were
   synthesized by assembling Ni-Co precursor needle arrays on the surface
   of the channel walls of hierarchical porous carbon aerogels derived from
   chitosan in this study. The 1D nanostructures grow on the channel
   surface of the carbon aerogel vertically and tightly, contributing to
   the enhanced electrochemical performance with ultrahigh energy density.
   The energy density of NiCo2S4 nanotube array/carbon aerogel and NiCo2O4
   nanoneedle array/carbon aerogel hybrid asymmetric supercapacitors can
   reach up to 55.3 Wh kg(-1) and 47.5 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 400
   W kg(-1), respectively. These asymmetric devices also displayed
   excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of about 96.6\%
   and 92\% over 5000 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconducting organic-inorganic nanocomposites comprising the
   conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in intimate contact
   with CdSe nanocrystals were crafted by exploiting rationally designed
   P3HT-grafted cadmium precursors (i.e., Cd-P3HT complexes). The
   bifunctional ligand 4-bromobenzyl phosphonic acid (BPA-Br) that
   possesses two terminal functional groups at each end was employed,
   enabling the coordination of BPA-Br with Cd first to yield Cd-phosphonic
   acid complexes (Cd-BPA-Br) followed by the subsequent substitution of
   the bromide moiety into the azide (N-3) group to form N-3-functionalized
   Cd-phosphonic acid complexes (Cd-BPA-N-3). Cd-P3HT complexes were then
   synthesized via a click reaction between Cd-BPA-N-3 and
   ethynyl-terminated P3HT (P3HT-u). The success of the click reaction was
   confirmed by spectroscopic measurements. The morphology of CdSe
   nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dot and multi-branched) in P3HT-CdSe
   nanocrystal nanocomposites can be altered by tuning the concentration of
   Cd-P3HT complexes and the addition of excess Cd-BPA-Br (i.e., Cd-P3HT
   solely for the synthesis of CdSe quantum dots, and Cd-P3HT and Cd-BPA-Br
   at the ratio Cd-P3HT : Cd-BPA-Br = 1 : 1 for the synthesis of
   multi-branched CdSe nanocrystals). The photophysical properties of the
   resulting P3HT-CdSe nanocomposites were examined via absorption and
   photoluminescence studies. In comparison with P3HT-u, the significant
   emission quenching of nanocomposites suggested the efficient charge
   transfer at the P3HT/CdSe interface. It is noteworthy that the
   implementation of judiciously synthesized Cd-P3HT complexes as
   precursors rendered the in situ synthesis of P3HT-CdSe nanocrystal
   nanocomposites, dispensing with the need for the use of insulating
   aliphatic ligands and tedious ligand exchange procedures for the
   preparation of functional polymertethered nanocrystals.}},

Title = {{Enhanced formation of isoprene-derived organic aerosol in sulfur-rich

Abstract = {{We investigate the effects of anthropogenic sulfate on secondary organic
   aerosol (SOA) formation from biogenic isoprene through airborne
   measurements in the southeastern United States as part of the Southeast
   Nexus (SENEX) field campaign. In a flight over Georgia, organic aerosol
   (OA) is enhanced downwind of the Harllee Branch power plant but not the
   Scherer power plant. We find that the OA enhancement is likely caused by
   the rapid reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) in the
   sulfate-rich plume of Harllee Branch, which was emitting at least 3
   times more sulfur dioxide (SO2) than Scherer, and more aerosol sulfate
   was produced downwind. The contrast in the evolution of isoprene-derived
   OA concentration between two power plants with different SO2 emissions
   provides an opportunity to investigate the magnitude and mechanisms of
   particle sulfate on isoprene-derived OA formation. We estimate that 1 mu
   gsm(-3) reduction of sulfate would decrease the isoprene-derived OA by
   0.230.08 mu gsm(-3). Based on a parameterization of the IEPOX
   heterogeneous reactions, we find that the effects of sulfate on
   isoprene-derived OA formation in the power plant plume arises from
   enhanced particle surface area and particle acidity, which increases
   both IEPOX uptake to particles and subsequent aqueous-phase reactions,
   respectively. The observed relationships between isoprene-OA, sulfate,
   particle pH, and particle water in previous field studies are explained
   using these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetite (Fe3O4) was used as a model high capacity metal oxide active
   material to demonstrate advantages derived from consideration of both
   electron and ion transport in the design of composite battery
   electrodes. The conjugated polymer, poly{[}3-(potassium-4-butanoate)
   thiophene] (PPBT), was introduced as a binder component, while
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) was coated onto the surface of Fe3O4
   nanoparticles. The introduction of PEG reduced aggregate size, enabled
   effective dispersion of the active materials and facilitated ionic
   conduction. As a binder for the composite electrode, PPBT underwent
   electrochemical doping which enabled the formation of effective
   electrical bridges between the carbon and Fe3O4 components, allowing for
   more efficient electron transport. Additionally, the PPBT carboxylic
   moieties effect a porous structure, and stable electrode performance.
   The methodical consideration of both enhanced electron and ion transport
   by introducing a carboxylated PPBT binder and PEG surface treatment
   leads to effectively reduced electrode resistance, which improved cycle
   life performance and rate capabilities.}},

Title = {{The effect of contouring on fatigue resistance of three types of
   fracture fixation plates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Metallic reconstruction plates used for fracture
   stabilization typically require intraoperative contouring for
   patient-specific anatomical fit. Despite this, characterization of plate
   mechanical properties after contouring has previously been limited. The
   objective of this study was to assess whether contouring affects fatigue
   resistance for three types of Stryker seven-hole stainless steel (SS)
   316LVM fracture fixation plates. The hypothesis was that for each plate
   type, more contouring repetitions would result in lower fatigue
   resistance.
   Methods: Plates were contoured using a bench-top plate bender to +/- 20
   degrees either 0x, 3x, 6x, or 9x (n = 5 per group) and tested in the
   straight configuration. Cyclic four-point bending was applied in an
   incremental stepwise staircase approach (one step = 100,000 cycles, 10
   Hz) until failure (defined as brittle fracture or plastic deformation of
   10 degrees permanent bend). Moment-cycle product (MCP) was computed as
   the summation of maximum moment x number of cycles and used as the
   primary measure of fatigue resistance.
   Results: No significant differences in fatigue resistance were detected
   between contouring groups for Basic Fragment Set (BFS) Reconstruction
   Plates. Significantly lower fatigue resistance was measured for 9x
   contoured Matta Pelvic System (MPS) Straight Plates compared to 0x
   contoured plates (p = 0.023). MPS Flex Plates contoured 3x had greater
   fatigue resistance than 0x contoured (p = 0.031) and 9x contoured plates
   (p = 0.032).
   Conclusions: This work provides fatigue resistance-based evidence that
   clinicians should avoid high repetitions of contouring for MPS Straight
   Plates. Meanwhile, BFS Reconstruction Plates and MPS Flex Plates are not
   negatively affected by contouring. These results allow for improved
   intraoperative decisions about using or discarding plates after multiple
   contouring repetitions.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in molecular pathology have changed the landscape of oncology.
   The ability to interrogate tissue samples for oncogene amplification,
   driver mutations, and other molecular alterations provides clinicians
   with an enormous level of detail about their patient's cancer. In some
   cases, this information informs treatment decisions, especially those
   related to targeted anti-cancer therapies. However, in terms of
   immune-based therapies, it is less clear how to use such information.
   Likewise, despite studies demonstrating the pivotal role of neoantigens
   in predicting responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade, it is not
   known if the expression of neoantigens impacts the response to targeted
   therapies despite a growing recognition of their diverse effects on
   immunity. To realize the promise of `personalized medicine', it will be
   important to develop a more integrated understanding of the
   relationships between oncogenic events and processes governing
   anti-tumor immunity. One area of investigation to explore such
   relationships centers on defining how ErbB/HER activation and signal
   transduction influences antigen processing and presentation.}},

Abstract = {{Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) have been functionalized using nitric
   acid. The functionalized MWNTs (f-MWNT) form stable dispersions in
   butanol, while as received nanotubes do not. The f-MWNTs/butanol
   dispersion was added with polypropylene (PP) or maleic anhydride grafted
   polypropylene (MA-g-PP) in xylene solution to form PP/f-MWNT and
   MA-g-PP/f-MWNT master batches, respectively. Both PP and MA-g-PP formed
   coatings on f-MWNTs, where the polymer coating thickness was 4-5 nm.
   Both PP and MA-g-PP exhibited non-covalently bonded interactions with
   f-MWNTs, and the evidence of these interactions was obtained using FTIR
   spectroscopy. The interfacial polymers (PP or MA-g-PP) in the master
   batches exhibited about 20 degrees C higher thermal decomposition
   temperature and greater chemical resistance in xylene than the bulk
   matrix polymer (PP or MA-g-PP). The PP/f-MWNT and MA-g-PP/f-MWNT master
   batches, as well as pristine MWNTs (p-MWNT) were melt blended with PP
   and injection molded nanocomposite samples were prepared from the melt
   blends. Studies regarding crystallization, rheology, and mechanical
   behavior all showed distinct differences in the nanocomposites
   performance when processed with MWNT5 via the two master-batch
   approaches, and from pristine nanotubes. Both master batches resulted in
   much better MWNT dispersions than was achieved using p-MWNTs. Mechanical
   properties of the three types of injection molded samples at 0.1 wt\%
   MWNT have been determined and compared. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{High impact strength polypropylene containing carbon nanotubes}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{259-274}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Polypropylene (PP)/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite studies have been
   extensively reported in the literature. Most of this previous work has
   been carried out by dispersing CNTs in PP matrix via melt processing,
   while only limited studies have been carried out where CNT dispersion in
   PP was achieved by solution processing. Here we report the melt
   processing of PP/multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) nanocomposites after
   achieving functionalized MWNT (f-MWNT) dispersion in PP, and in maleic
   anhydride-g-PP (MA-g-PP) master batches using a butanol/xylene solvent
   mixture. For comparison, melt mixing of PP with pristine MWNTs (p-MWNTs)
   without functionalization was also carried out. The three types of
   nanocomposites (from PP/f-MWNT and MA-g-PP/f-MWNT master batches and
   from p-MWNT) were prepared using micro-compounding, followed by
   injection molding. In each case, the weight percent of MWNTs in the
   injection molded samples was 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1
   wt\%. Tensile properties, impact strength, and heat deflection
   temperatures of the composites have been studied. Mechanical property
   improvements were observed at concentrations as low as 0.001 wt\% CNT
   loading. For example, at 0.001 wt\% CNT, a statistically significant
   increase in modulus was observed using PP/f-MWNT master batch. At 1 wt\%
   CNT loading, impact strength increased by 152\% in samples prepared from
   PP/f-MWNT master batch, as compared to the control PP containing no
   CNTs. This is the highest percentage increase in impact strength
   reported to date for the homopolymer PP/CNT or for any other
   thermoplastic/CNT system, at 1 wt\% CNT. This increase has been achieved
   while maintaining excellent ductility and high strain to failure of
   113\%. By comparison, the strain to failure at the same CNT
   concentration of 1 wt\% was 12.5\% and 19.9\% for p-MWNT based and
   MA-g-PP/f-MWNT based nano composites, respectively. The changes in
   mechanical properties have been discussed in terms of crystallization
   behavior, structure, and morphology of the nanocomposites. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Secure multiparty computation (SMC) offers a technique to preserve
   functionality and data privacy in mobile applications. Current protocols
   that make this costly cryptographic construction feasible on mobile
   devices securely outsource the bulk of the computation to a cloud
   provider. However, these outsourcing techniques are built on specific
   secure computation assumptions and tools, and applying new SMC ideas to
   the outsourced setting requires the protocols to be completely rebuilt
   and proven secure. In this work, we develop a generic technique for
   lifting any secure two-party computation protocol into an outsourced
   two-party SMC protocol. By augmenting the function being evaluated with
   auxiliary consistency checks and input values, we can create an
   outsourced protocol with low overhead cost. Our implementation and
   evaluation show that in the best case our outsourcing additions execute
   within the confidence intervals of two servers running the same
   computation and consume approximately the same bandwidth. In addition,
   the mobile device itself uses minimal bandwidth over a single round of
   communication. This work demonstrates that efficient outsourcing is
   possible with any underlying SMC scheme and provides an outsourcing
   protocol that is efficient and directly applicable to current and future
   SMC techniques. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are used industrially and
   commercially at increasingly high levels. While toxicity is addressed
   prior to use, it is also important to consider the cellular response to
   these nanoparticles at subcytotoxic concentrations. We used PCR arrays
   to screen for changes to 84 different oxidative stress-related genes in
   response to the incubation of cells with TiO2 nanoparticles. We found
   that expression of four members of the peroxiredoxin family of
   antioxidant enzymes was altered in response to the TiO2 nanoparticles.
   The oxidative stress response was specific to TiO2 nanoparticles;
   polystyrene nanoparticles did not alter the expression of the
   peroxiredoxins. In addition, serum proteins adsorbed on the surface of
   the TiO2 nanoparticles had a protective effect. In the absence of serum
   proteins, TiO2 nanoparticles were cytotoxic at the same concentrations.
   These experiments demonstrate that protein TiO2 nanoparticle complexes
   lead to a unique oxidative stress response in cells. More broadly, these
   experiments point to the importance of examining the cellular response
   to nanoparticles at low concentrations that do not lead to cytotoxicity
   but may cause more subtle cellular changes}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a systematic study of how Au atoms nucleate and
   grow on Pd icosahedral seeds with a multiply twinned structure. By
   manipulating the reduction kinetics, we obtained Pd-Au bimetallic
   nanocrystals with two distinct shapes and structures. Specifically,
   Pd@Au core shell icosahedra were formed when a relatively fast reduction
   rate was used for the HAuCl4 precursor. At a slow reduction rate, in
   contrast, the nucleation and growth of Au atoms were mainly confined to
   one of the vertices of a Pd icosahedral seed, resulting in the formation
   of a Au icosahedron by sharing five adjacent faces with the Pd seed. The
   same growth pattern was observed for Pd icosahedral seeds with both
   sizes of 32 and 20 mu. We have also investigated the effects of other
   kinetic parameters, including the concentration of reducing agent and
   reaction temperature, on the growth pathway undertaken by the Au atoms.
   We believe that the mechanistic insights obtained from this study can be
   extended to other systems, including the involvement of different metals
   and/or seeds with different morphologies.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional dual-energy CT (DECT) reconstruction requires two fullsize
   projection datasets with two different energy spectra. In this study, we
   propose an iterative algorithm to enable a new data acquisition scheme
   which requires one full scan and a second sparse-view scan for potential
   reduction in imaging dose and engineering cost of DECT. A bilateral
   filter is calculated as a similarity matrix from the first full-scan CT
   image to quantify the similarity between any two pixels, which is
   assumed unchanged on a second CT image since DECT scans are performed on
   the same object. The second CT image from reduced projections is
   reconstructed by an iterative algorithm which updates the image by
   minimizing the total variation of the difference between the image and
   its filtered image by the similarity matrix under data fidelity
   constraint. As the redundant structural information of the two CT images
   is contained in the similarity matrix for CT reconstruction, we refer to
   the algorithm as structure preserving iterative reconstruction (SPIR).
   The proposed method is evaluated on both digital and physical phantoms,
   and is compared with the filtered-backprojection (FBP) method, the
   conventional total-variation-regularization-based algorithm (TVR) and
   prior-image-constrained-compressed-sensing (PICCS). SPIR with a second
   10-view scan reduces the image noise STD by a factor of one order of
   magnitude with same spatial resolution as full-view FBP image. SPIR
   substantially improves over TVR on the reconstruction accuracy of a
   10-view scan by decreasing the reconstruction error from 6.18\% to
   1.33\%, and outperforms TVR at 50 and 20-view scans on spatial
   resolution with a higher frequency at the modulation transfer function
   value of 10\% by an average factor of 4. Compared with the 20-view scan
   PICCS result, the SPIR image has 7 times lower noise STD with similar
   spatial resolution. The electron density map obtained from the
   SPIR-based DECT images with a second 10-view scan has an average error
   of less than 1\%.}},

Abstract = {{The probabilistic ignition thresholds of pressed granular
   octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,2,3, 5-tetrazocine explosives with
   average grain sizes between 70 mu m and 220 mu m are computationally
   predicted. The prediction uses material microstructure and basic
   constituent properties and does not involve curve fitting with respect
   to or prior knowledge of the attributes being predicted. The specific
   thresholds predicted are James-type relations between the energy flux
   and energy fluence for given probabilities of ignition. Statistically
   similar microstructure sample sets are computationally generated and
   used based on the features of micrographs of materials used in actual
   experiments. The predicted thresholds are in general agreement with
   measurements from shock experiments in terms of trends. In particular,
   it is found that grain size significantly affects the ignition
   sensitivity of the materials, with smaller sizes leading to lower energy
   thresholds required for ignition. For example, 50\% ignition threshold
   of the material with an average grain size of 220 mu m is approximately
   1.4-1.6 times that of the material with an average grain size of 70 mu m
   in terms of energy fluence. The simulations account for the controlled
   loading of thin-flyer shock experiments with flyer velocities between
   1.5 and 4.0 km/s, constituent elasto-viscoplasticity, fracture,
   post-fracture contact and friction along interfaces, bulk inelastic
   heating, interfacial frictional heating, and heat conduction. The
   constitutive behavior of the materials is described using a finite
   deformation elasto-viscoplastic formulation and the Birch-Murnaghan
   equation of state. The ignition thresholds are determined via an
   explicit analysis of the size and temperature states of hotspots in the
   materials and a hotspot-based ignition criterion. The overall ignition
   threshold analysis and the microstructure-level hotspot analysis also
   lead to the definition of a macroscopic ignition parameter (J) and a
   microscopic ignition risk parameter (R) which are statistically related.
   The relationships between these parameters are established and
   delineated. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-loaded zeolitic membranes are promising candidates as catalytic
   membrane reactors. We report a one-step synthesis method to synthesize
   zeolite membranes containing metal nanodusters, that has advantages in
   comparison to multistep methods such as impregnation and ion exchange.
   Pure-silica MFI zeolite-Pt hybrid membranes were prepared by
   hydrothermal synthesis with addition of
   3-mercaptopropyt-trimethoxysilane (MPS) and a platinum precursor.
   Composition analysis and mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDX) reveal that Pt ions/clusters are uniformly distributed along the
   membrane cross-section. High-magnification scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (STEM) analysis shows that Pt metal dusters in the
   hybrid zeolite membrane have a diameter distribution in the range of
   0.5-2.0 nm. In contrast, a pure-silica MFI membrane synthesized from an
   MPS-free solution shows negligible incorporation of Pt metal dusters. To
   characterize the properties of the hybrid (zeolite/metal)' Membrane, it
   was used as a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) for high-temperature
   propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600 degrees C and 1 at-m. The results
   indicate that Pt metal dusters formed within the MFI zeolite membrane
   can serve as effective catalysts for high-temperature PDH reaction-along
   with H-2 removal via membrane permeation, thereby increasing both
   conversion and selectivity in relation to a conventional membrane
   reactor containing an equivalent amount of packed Pt catalyst in contact
   with an MFI membrane. The hybrid zeolite-Pt CMR also showed stable
   conversion and selectivity upon extended high-temperature operation (12
   h), indicating that encapsulation in the zeolite allowed thermal
   stabilization of the Pt nanodusters and reduced catalyst deactivation.}},

Abstract = {{Solution- shearing has attracted great interest for the fabrication of
   robust and reliable, highl3erformance organic electronic devices,,owing
   to applicability of the Method to large area and continuous fabrication,

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that stronger and more robust nacre-like laminated GO
   (graphene oxide)/SF (silk fibroin) nanocomposite membranes tan be
   obtained by selectively tailoring the interfacial interactions between
   ``bricks{''}-GO sheets and ``mortar{''}-silk interlayers via controlled
   water vapor annealing. This facial annealing process relaxes the
   secondary structure of silk backbones confined between flexible GO
   sheets. The increased mobility leads to a significant increase in
   ultimate strength (by up to 41\%), Young's modulus (up to 75\%) and
   toughness (up to 45\%). We suggest that local silk recrystallization is
   initiated in the proximity to GO surface by the hydrophobic surface
   regions serving as nucleation sites for beta-sheet domains formation and
   followed by SF assembly into nanofibrils. Strong hydrophobic-hydrophobic
   interactions between GO layers with SF nanofibrils result in enhanced
   shear strength of layered packing. This work presented here not only
   gives a better understanding of SF and GO interfacial interactions, but
   also provides insight on how to enhance the mechanical properties for
   the nacre-mimic nanocomposites by focusing on adjusting the delicate
   interactions between heterogeneous ``brick{''} and adaptive ``mortar{''}
   components with water/temperature annealing routines.}},

Abstract = {{A materials fabrication concept based on a fluid construction strategy
   to create three-dimensional (3D) ZnO@ZnS-Ag active nanostructures at
   arbitrary position within confined microchannels to form an integrated
   microfluidic surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) system is
   presented. The fluid-construction process allowed facile construction of
   the nanostructured substrates, which were shown to possess a substantial
   number of integrated hot spots that support SERS activity.
   Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis suggested that the 3D
   clustered geometry facilitated hot spot formation. High sensitivity and
   good recycle performance were demonstrated using 4-mercaptobenzoic acid
   (4-MBA) and a mixture of Rhodarnine 6G (R6G) and 4-MBA as target organic
   pollutants to evaluate the SERS microfluidic device performance. The 3D
   clustered nanostructures were also effective in the detection of a
   representative nerve agent and biomolecule. The results of this
   investigation provide a materials and process approach to the
   fabrication of requisite nanostructures for the online detection of
   organic pollutants, devices for real-time observation of environmental
   hazards, and personal-health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of hydrocarbon processes, catalytic or noncatalytic,
   involve the formation of carbon deposits, either on catalysts or on
   reactor (or engine/exhaust) surfaces. Therefore, researchers have
   developed a large array of catalysts to aid the combustion of these
   deposits. Recently, the mechanism of catalytic carbon oxidation and/or
   gasification has been the focus of research in an attempt to design
   better catalysts for carbon removal. With this approach, understanding
   the mechanism of formation of different types of carbon deposits is
   desired. Efforts undertaken for studying oxidation or gasification of
   various forms of carbon deposits are discussed in this review, along
   with the techniques used to study the mechanism of
   oxidation/gasification. The kinetics of catalyzed and noncatalytic
   carbon oxidation are described in detail. The effect of reactive gases
   such as NOx, water vapor, CO2, and SO2 on the gasification behavior of
   carbon deposits is also discussed. Reaction rates of
   oxidation/gasification of carbon under different operating conditions
   have been calculated, allowing for a comprehensive overview of carbon
   removal reactivity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: The rapidly evolving discipline of biological and biomedical
   engineering requires adaptive instructional approaches that teach
   students to target and solve multi-pronged and ill-structured problems
   at the cutting edge of scientific research. Here we present a modular
   approach to designing a lab-based course in the emerging field of
   biofabrication and biological design, leading to a final capstone design
   project that requires students to formulate and test a hypothesis using
   the scientific method.
   Results: Students were assessed on a range of metrics designed to
   evaluate the format of the course, the efficacy of the format for
   teaching new topics and concepts, and the depth of the contribution this
   course made to students training for biological engineering careers. The
   evaluation showed that the problem-based format of the course was well
   suited to teaching students how to use the scientific method to
   investigate and uncover the fundamental biological design rules that
   govern the field of biofabrication.
   Conclusions: We show that this approach is an efficient and effective
   method of translating emergent scientific principles from the lab bench
   to the classroom and training the next generation of biological and
   biomedical engineers for careers as researchers and industry
   practicians.}},

Abstract = {{We report a quantitative understanding of the reduction kinetics
   responsible for the formation of Pd-Pt bimetallic nanocrystals with two
   distinctive structures. The syntheses involve the use of KBr to
   manipulate the reaction kinetics by influencing the redox potentials of
   metal precursor ions via ligand exchange. In the absence of KBr, the
   ratio between the initial reduction rates of PdCl42- and PtCl42- was
   about 10.0, leading to the formation of Pd@Pt octahedra with a
   core-shell structure. In the presence of 63 mM KBr, the products became
   Pd-Pt alloy nanocrystals. In this case, the ratio between the initial
   reduction rates of the two precursors dropped to 2.4 because of ligand
   exchange and, thus, the formation of PdBr42- and PtBr42-. The alloy
   nanocrystals took a cubic shape owing to the selective capping effect of
   Br- ions toward the \{100\} facets. Relative to the alloy nanocubes, the
   Pd@Pt core-shell octahedra showed substantial enhancement in both
   catalytic activity and durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR). Specifically, the specific (1.51 mA cm(-2)) and mass (1.05 A
   mg(-1) (pt)) activities of the core-shell octahedra were enhanced by
   about four- and three-fold relative to the alloy nanocubes (0.39 mA
   cm(-2) and 0.34 A mg(-1) (pt), respectively). Even after 20000 cycles of
   accelerated durability test, the core-shell octahedra still exhibited a
   mass activity of 0.68 A mg(-1) (pt), twice that of a pristine commercial
   Pt/C catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Void fraction measurements are obtained using high-speed video for the
   condensation of R404A in tubes of diameter 0.508, 1.00, and 3.00mm.
   Experiments were conducted on refrigerant R404A throughout the entire
   condensation quality range (0.05-0.95) at varying mass fluxes (200-800kg
   m(-2) s(-1)) and saturation temperatures from 30 to 60 degrees C (which
   correspond to the reduced pressure range 0.38-0.77). These high
   pressures are representative of actual operation of air-conditioning and
   refrigeration equipment. The influence of saturation temperature on void
   fraction is most pronounced in the quality range 0.25-0.75. In addition,
   it was found that the influence of mass flux on void fraction was
   negligible for all saturation temperatures and tube diameters
   investigated. Three void fraction models from the literature are
   compared with the data. Of these, the Baroczy correlation predicted the
   data the best, with an overall absolute average deviation of 11.2\%. A
   new drift flux void fraction model is developed to predict void fraction
   for condensing flows in microchannels and compared with the R404A data
   and R134a void fraction data from Winkler etal. Overall, the model is
   able to predict 92.3\% of the R404A data and 81.6\% of all refrigerant
   data within 25\%.}},

Abstract = {{When anoxic polluted groundwater encounters the overlying vadose zone an
   oxic/anoxic interface is created, often near the capillary fringe.
   Biodegradation of volatile contaminants in the capillary fringe can
   prevent vapor migration. In contrast, the biodegradation of nonvolatile
   contaminants in the vadose zone has received comparatively little
   attention. Nonvolatile compounds do not cause vapor intrusion, but they
   still move with the groundwater and are major contaminants. Aniline (AN)
   and diphenylamine (DPA) are examples of toxic nonvolatile contaminants
   found often at dye and munitions manufacturing sites. In this study, we
   tested the hypothesis that bacteria can aerobically biodegrade AN and
   DPA in the capillary fringe and decrease the contaminant concentrations
   in the anoxic plume beneath the vadose zone. Laboratory multiport
   columns that represented the unsaturated zone were used to evaluate
   degradation of AN or DPA in contaminated water. The biodegradation
   fluxes of the contaminants were estimated to be 113 +/- 26 mg AN.m(-2).
   h(-1) and 76 +/- 18 mg DPA.m(-2).h(-1) in the presence of bacteria known
   to degrade AN and DPA. Oxygen and contaminant profiles along with
   enumeration of bacterial populations indicated that most of the
   biodegradation took place within the lower part of the capillary fringe.
   The results indicate that bacteria capable of contaminant biodegradation
   in the capillary fringe can create a sink for nonvolatile contaminants.}},

Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental understanding of the expansion kinetics of expandable
   polystyrene (EPS) is crucial for the design and optimization of
   processes for EPS-filled syntactic foams. In this study, a general
   formulation was developed to model EPS expansion. A semi-analytical
   solution was obtained on the basis of the case of a single bubble
   expansion in an infinite matrix. The dimensionless bubble radius and
   pressure were defined and found to be exponential functions of the
   dimensionless expansion time. The characteristic bubble expansion time
   was able to characterize the timescale of the expansion process. The
   semi-analytical solution could qualitatively predict the radial
   expansion of the EPS microsphere observed in a real-time experiment. To
   obtain an accurate prediction, a numerical solution was obtained to the
   model that coupled the nucleation and expansion of multiple bubbles in a
   finite matrix at various temperatures. The results show that the
   numerical solution was able to quantitatively predict the radial
   expansion of EPS. A parameter sensitivity study was performed to examine
   the effect of each parameter over the expansion process. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Spherical nanoindentation combined with electron back-scattered
   diffraction has been employed to characterize the grain-scale elastic
   and plastic anisotropy of single crystal alpha-Ti of two different
   compositions (in two different titanium alloys). Data analyses protocols
   needed to reliably extract the desired properties of interest are
   extended and demonstrated in this paper. Specifically, the grain-scale
   mechanical response is extracted in the form of indentation
   stress-strain curves for commercially pure (CP-Ti) alpha Ti and alloyed
   (Ti-64) titanium from measurements on polycrystalline samples. The
   results are compared with responses of single crystals and
   nanoindentation tests (hardness and modulus) from the literature, and
   the measured indentation moduli are validated using crystal-elastic
   finite element simulations. The results obtained in this study show that
   (i) it is possible to characterize reliably the elastic and plastic
   anisotropy of alpha-Ti (hcp) of varying alloying contents with spherical
   nano indentation stress-strain curves, (ii) the indentation modulus of
   alpha-Ti-64 is 5-10\% less than CP-Ti, and (iii) the indentation yield
   strength of alpha-Ti-64 is 50-80\% higher than CP-Ti. (C) 2016 Acta

   concentration range. Device modeling is performed to optimize several
   HEMT device parameters for sensing, and the experimental results show
   that the optimized sensor has improved performance compared with the
   previously reported HEMT sensors. The device shows significant no
   sensitivity for the first time in an HEMT device, with sensitivity up to
   7\% at 400 degrees C. In addition, high sensitivities of up to 17\% are
   reported for NO2, and NH3 is detected at concentrations as low as 150
   ppb.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites based on polyoxometalates (POMs) nanoconfined in
   microporous carbons have been synthesized and used as electrodes for
   supercapacitors. The addition of the pseudocapacitance from highly
   reversible redox reaction of POMs to the electric double-layer
   capacitance of carbon lead to an increase in specific capacitance of
   similar to 90\% at 1 mV s(-1). However, high solubility of POM in
   traditional aqueous electrolytes leads to rapid capacity fading. Here we
   demonstrate that the use of aqueous solutions of protic ionic liquids
   (P-IL) as electrolyte instead of aqueous sulfuric acid solutions offers
   an opportunity to significantly improve POM cycling stability. Virtually
   no degradation in capacitance was observed in POM-based positive
   electrode after 10,000 cycles in an asymmetric capacitor with P-IL
   aqueous electrolyte. As such, POM-based carbon composites may now
   present a viable solution for enhancing energy density of electrical
   double layer capacitors (EDLC) based on pure carbon electrodes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This research develops a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique to
   obtain images of two types of defects, delamination and debonding, in a
   thick laminate composite plate as a laboratory material system for wind
   turbine blades. The technique uses focused shear waves which are
   generated and detected by a set of noncontact, air-coupled ultrasonic
   transducers. The noncontact nature of the air-coupled method facilitates
   rapid scanning/inspection of large composite structures. Ray-tracing
   simulations are performed which visualize the focusing behavior of the
   focused shear waves in the specimen, from which the experimental
   parameters are determined. The proposed focused shear wave technique is
   compared with a Lamb-wave based technique, showing that the present
   technique is more appropriate for direct imaging of these defects. The
   obtained images of delamination and debonding defects agree well with
   the estimated defect locations and dimensions. This demonstrates the
   feasibility of further developing the present technique for specific
   field applications in wind turbine blades. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{ANCOVA-based grouping of bridge classes for seismic fragility assessment}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{379-394}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Fragility curves that can be applicable for vulnerability modeling of
   various configurations of structures, such as bridges, are required to
   facilitate regional seismic risk assessment. However, it is cumbersome
   and time-consuming to develop unique fragility curves for each structure
   across a regional portfolio. One strategy that has been adopted to
   address this challenge is to group bridges into classes with similar
   design or structural performance. Traditionally, this grouping has been
   performed based on a relatively subjective identification of
   sub-classes. However, such an identification leads to a number of bridge
   classes with unwarranted grouping. To overcome this limitation, a new
   grouping technique based on an analysis of covariance on probabilistic
   seismic demand models is suggested in this paper. The proposed analysis
   of covariance based grouping helps to identify important
   attribute-related parameters and to create distinct bridge sub-classes.
   The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper
   through case studies of four concrete box-girder bridges in California.
   This is the first systematic approach to sub-binning bridge classes for
   the regional risk assessment. The results suggest that the proposed
   grouping method significantly reduces bridge sub-classes from all
   possible sub-class combinations. The proposed method is relevant and can
   be applicable to other bridge types. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A high-order adaptive Cartesian cut-cell method for simulation of
   compressible viscous flow over immersed bodies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{321}},
Pages = {{342-368}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A new adaptive finite volume conservative cut-cell method that is
   third-order accurate for simulation of compressible viscous flows is
   presented. A high-order reconstruction approach using cell centered
   piecewise polynomial approximation of flow quantities, developed in the
   past for body-fitted grids, is now extended to the Cartesian based
   cut-cell method. It is shown that the presence of cut-cells of very low
   volume results in numerical oscillations in the flow solution near the
   embedded boundaries when standard small cell treatment techniques are
   employed. A novel cell clustering approach for polynomial reconstruction
   in the vicinity of the small cells is proposed and is shown to achieve
   smooth representation of flow field quantities and their derivatives on
   immersed interfaces. It is further shown through numerical examples that
   the proposed clustering method achieves the design order of accuracy and
   is fairly insensitive to the cluster size. Results are presented for
   canonical flow past a single cylinder and a sphere at different flow
   Reynolds numbers to verify the accuracy of the scheme. Investigations
   are then performed for flow over two staggered cylinders and the results
   are compared with prior data for the same configuration. All the
   simulations are carried out with both quadratic and cubic
   reconstruction, and the results indicate a clear improvement with the
   cubic reconstruction. The new cut-cell approach with cell clustering is
   able to predict accurate results even at relatively low resolutions. The
   ability of the high-order cut-cell method in handling sharp geometrical
   corners and narrow gaps is also demonstrated using various examples.
   Finally, three-dimensional flow interactions between a pair of spheres
   in cross flow is investigated using the proposed cut-cell scheme. The
   results are shown to be in excellent agreement with past studies, which
   employed body-fitted grids for studying this complex case. (C) 2016

   baseband-unit (BBU) pool to precisely estimate the channel quality and
   perform pre-equalization for multiple bands with high spectral
   efficiency. Bidirectional transmission experiments are conducted with

Abstract = {{Self-standing and flexible films worked as pseudocapacitor electrodes
   have been fabricated via a simple vacuum-filtration procedure to stack
   delta-MnO2@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite layer and pure CNT layer
   one by one with CNT layers ended. The lightweight CNTs layers served as
   both current collector and supporter, while the MnO2@CNTs composite
   layers with birnessite-type MnO2 worked as active layer and made the
   main contribution to the capacitance. At a low discharge current of 0.2
   A g(1), the layered films displayed a high areal capacitance of 0.293 F
   cm(2) with a mass of 1.97 mg cm(2) (specific capacitance of 149 F g(1))
   and thickness of only 16.5 mu m, and hence an volumetric capacitance of
   about 177.5 F cm(3). Moreover, the films also exhibited a good rate
   capability (only about 15\% fading for the capacitance when the
   discharge current increased to 5 A g(1) from 0.2 A g(1)), outstanding
   cycling stability (about 90\% of the initial capacitance was remained
   after 5,000 cycles) and high flexibility (almost no performance change
   when bended to different angles). In addition, the capacitance of the
   films increased proportionally with the stacked layers and the geometry
   area. E.g., when the stacked layers were three times many with a mass of
   6.18 mg cm(2), the areal capacitance of the films was increased to 0.764
   F cm(2) at 0.5 A g(1), indicating a high electronic conductivity. It is
   not overstated to say that the flexible and lightweight layered films
   emerged high potential for future practical applications as
   supercapacitor electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels usually suffer from lbw mechanical strength, which largely
   limit their application in many fields. In this Research Article, we
   prepared a dual physically cross-linked hydrogel composed of
   poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PAM-co-PAA) and poly(vinyl alcohol)
   (PVA) by simple two-steps methods of copolymerization and
   freezing/thawing. The hydrogen bond-associated entanglement of copolymer
   chains formed as cross-linking points to construct the first network.
   After being subjected to the freezing/thawing treatment, PVA crystalline
   domains were formed to serve as knots of the second network. The
   hydrogels were demonstrated to integrate strength and toughness (1230
   +/- 90 kPa and 1250 +/- 50 kJ/m(3)) by the introduction of second
   physically cross-linked network. Whats more, the hydrogels exhibited
   rapid recovery, excellent fatigue resistance, and self-healing property.
   The dynamic property of the dual physically cross-linked network
   contributes to the excellent energy dissipation and self-healing
   property. Therefore, this work provides a new route to understand the
   toughness mechanism of dual physically cross-linked hydrogels, hopefully
   promoting current hydrogel research and expanding their applications.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient removal of heat via thermal interface materials has become one
   of the most critical challenges in the development of modern
   microelectronic devices. However, traditional polymer composites present
   limited thermal conductivity even when highly loaded with highly
   thermally conductive fillers due to the lack of efficient heat transfer
   channels. In this work, vertically aligned and interconnected graphene
   networks are first used as the filler, which is prepared by a controlled
   three-step procedure: formation of graphene oxide liquid crystals,
   oriented freeze casting, and high temperature annealing reduction under
   Ar. The obtained composite, at an ultralow graphene loading of 0.92 vol
   \%, exhibits a high thermal conductivity (2.13 W m(-1) K-1) that is
   equivalent to a dramatic enhancement of 1231\% compared to the pure
   matrix. Furthermore, the composite also presents a much reduced
   coefficient of thermal expansion (similar to 37.4 ppm K-1) and increased
   glass transition temperature (135.4 degrees C). This strategy provides
   an insight for the design of high-performance composites with potential
   to be used in advanced electronic packaging.}},

Title = {{Relax: A Sterically Relaxed Donor-Acceptor Approach for Color Tuning in

Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{A family of five electrochromic polymers (ECPs) based on
   3,4-dioxythiophenes (XDOTs) (where X = ethylene (E) and propylene (Pro))
   or a 3,4-diacyclic-substituted dioxythiophene (AcDOT, Ac) as main chain
   donors coupled in a random fashion with the sterically relaxed (i.e.,
   low torsional energy barriers to planarity) donor-acceptor-donor unit
   BDOT-BTD-EDOT (EBE, BTD = 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) were synthesized using
   direct heteroarylation polymerization conditions. Designed as broadly
   light absorbing materials to improve overall contrast, ECPs were
   solution spray-cast into thin. films, and their electrochromic
   properties were measured and compared against the previously reported
   ECP-Black (random copolymer composed of ProDOT and BTD). These new
   polymers exhibit enhanced integrated contrasts across the visible region
   (380-780 nm, Delta\%T-int) larger than 45\%, the highest achieved being
   similar to 52\%, a substantial improvement over ECP-Black (Delta\%T-int
   = similar to 32\%). Increasing torsional strain of the main chain donor
   units moves the short wavelength peak to higher energy, allowing hue
   control. Increasing the composition of the EBE monomer in random
   copolymers yields more level and uniform absorption across the visible,
   reducing hue saturation and giving more muted colors relative to the
   normally vibrantly colored ECPs with no observable loss in contrast.
   Pro-Ac-0.65/EBE0.35 gave the highest integrated electrochromic contrast
   with color values (L{*}a{*}b{*} where L{*} indicates lightness, a{*}
   defines green and red, and b{*} defines blue and yellow hues, for
   negative and positive values, respectively); indicating improved color
   neutrality (45, 5, 3) when compared to ECP-Black (47, 3, -14).
   Two-component solution blends of Pro-Ac-0.65/EBE0.35 with the previously
   reported all donor polymer ProDOT(2)-EDOT in differing weight ratios
   were prepared and cast into films giving more aesthetically pleasing
   black-to-transmissive electrochromes, while maintaining a high
   integrated contrast at similar to 51\%. The use of EBE demonstrates the
   synthetic capability to improve the contrast of broadly absorbing ECPs
   for black or dark-to-transmissive applications in electrochromic window
   and display-type devices.}},

Abstract = {{Developing lightweight, flexible, foldable and sustainable power sources
   with simple transport and storage remains a challenge and an urgent need
   for the advancement of next-generation wearable electronics. Here, we
   report a micro-cable power textile for simultaneously harvesting energy
   from ambient sunshine and mechanical movement. Solar cells fabricated
   from lightweight polymer fibres into micro cables are then woven via a
   shuttle-flying process with fibre-based triboelectric nanogenerators to
   create a smart fabric. A single layer of such fabric is 320 mu m thick
   and can be integrated into various cloths, curtains, tents and so on.
   This hybrid power textile, fabricated with a size of 4 cm by 5 cm, was
   demonstrated to charge a 2 mF commercial capacitor up to 2V in 1 min
   under ambient sunlight in the presence of mechanical excitation, such as
   human motion and wind blowing. The textile could continuously power an
   electronic watch, directly charge a cell phone and drive water splitting

Abstract = {{Liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) patients differ in both
   pretreatment liver function (e.g. due to degree of cirrhosis and/or
   prior treatment) and radiosensitivity, leading to high variability in
   potential liver toxicity with similar doses. This work investigates
   three treatment planning optimization models that minimize risk of
   toxicity: two consider both voxel-based pretreatment liver function and
   local-function-based radiosensitivity with dose; one considers only
   dose. Each model optimizes different objective functions (varying in
   complexity of capturing the influence of dose on liver function) subject
   to the same dose constraints and are tested on 2D synthesized and 3D
   clinical cases. The normal-liver-based objective functions are the
   linearized equivalent uniform dose (lEUD) (conventional `lEUD model'),
   the so-called perfusion-weighted lEUD (fEUD) (proposed `fEUD model'),
   and post-treatment global liver function (GLF) (proposed `GLF model'),
   predicted by a new liver-perfusion-based dose-response model. The
   resulting lEUD, fEUD, and GLF plans delivering the same target lEUD are
   compared with respect to their post-treatment function and various
   dose-based metrics. Voxel-based portal venous liver perfusion, used as a
   measure of local function, is computed using DCE-MRI. In cases used in
   our experiments, the GLF plan preserves up to 4.6\%(7.5\%) more liver
   function than the fEUD (lEUD) plan does in 2D cases, and up to
   4.5\%(5.6\%) in 3D cases. The GLF and fEUD plans worsen in lEUD of
   functional liver on average by 1.0 Gy and 0.5 Gy in 2D and 3D cases,
   respectively. Liver perfusion information can be used during treatment
   planning to minimize the risk of toxicity by improving expected GLF; the
   degree of benefit varies with perfusion pattern. Although fEUD model
   optimization is computationally inexpensive and often achieves better
   GLF than lEUD model optimization does, the GLF model directly optimizes

Abstract = {{Carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, and
   carbon fibers can be used as fillers in amorphous polymers to improve
   their thermal properties. In this study, the effect of covalent bonding
   of CNT with poly(ether ketone) (PEK) on interfacial thermal interactions
   is investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.
   The number of covalent bonds between (20, 20) CNT and PEK is varied in
   the range of 0-80 (0\%-6.25\%), and the thermal boundary conductance is
   computed. The analysis reveals that covalent functionalization of CNT
   atoms can enhance the thermal boundary conductance by an order of
   magnitude compared to the non-functionalized CNT-PEK interface at a high
   degree of CNT functionalization. Besides strengthening the thermal
   coupling, covalent functionalization is also shown to modify the phonon
   spectra of CNT. The transient spectral energy analysis shows that the
   crosslinks cause faster energy exchange from CNT to PEK in different
   frequency bands. The oxygen atom of hydroxyl group of PEK contributes
   energy transfer in the low frequency band, while aromatic and carbonyl
   carbon atoms play a more significant role in high frequency bands. In
   addition, by analyzing the relaxation time of the spectral temperature
   of different frequency bands of CNT, it is revealed that with increasing
   number of bonds, both lower frequency vibrational modes and higher
   frequency modes efficiently couple across the CNT-PEK interface and
   contribute in thermal energy transfer from CNT to the matrix. Published

Abstract = {{Most of the models for simulating vapor intrusion accept the local
   equilibrium assumption for multiphase concentration distributions, that
   is, concentrations in solid, liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium.
   For simulating vapor transport with aerobic biodegradation controlled by
   counter diffusion processes, the local equilibrium assumption combined
   with dual-Monod kinetics and biomass decay may yield near-instantaneous
   behavior at steady state. The present research investigates how
   predicted concentration profiles and fluxes change as interphase mass
   transfer resistances are increased for vapor intrusion with aerobic
   biodegradation. Our modeling results indicate that the attenuation
   coefficients for cases with and without mass transfer limitations can be
   significantly different by orders of magnitude. Rate-limited mass
   transfer may lead to larger overlaps of contaminant vapor and oxygen
   concentrations, which cannot be simulated by instantaneous reaction
   models with local equilibrium mass transfer. In addition, the
   contaminant flux with rate-limited mass transfer is much smaller than
   that with local equilibrium mass transfer, indicating that local
   equilibrium mass transfer assumption may significantly overestimate the
   biodegradation rate and capacity for mitigating vapor intrusion through
   the unsaturated zone. Our results indicate a strong research need for
   field tests to examine the validity of local equilibrium mass transfer,
   a widely accepted assumption in modeling vapor intrusion.}},

Abstract = {{The in situ IR and Raman spectroscopy measurements were conducted to
   investigate lead poisoning on the CeO2-WO3 catalysts. The deactivation
   mechanisms were studied with respect to the changes of surface acidity,
   redox property, nitrate/nitrite adsorption behaviors, and key active
   sites (note that the results of structure activity relationship of
   CeO2-WO3 were based on our previous research). (1) Lewis acid sites
   originated from CeO2 and crystalline WO3, whereas Bronsted acid sites
   originated from Ce-2(WO4)(3). The poisoned catalysts exhibited a lower
   surface acidity than the fresh catalysts: the number of acid sites
   decreased, and their thermal stability weakened. (2) The reducibility of
   catalysts and the amount of active oxygen exhibited a smaller influence
   after poisoning because lead preferred to bond with surface WOx species
   rather than CeO2. (3) The quantity of active nitrate species decreased
   due to the lead coverage on the catalyst and the partial bridged-nitrate
   species induced by lead exhibited a low degree of activity at 200
   degrees C. (4) Crystalline WO3 and Ce-2(WO4)(3) originated from the
   transformation of polytungstate sites. These sites were the key active
   sites during the SCR process. The formation temperatures of
   polytungstate on the poisoned catalysts were higher than those on the
   fresh catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: HIV patients on highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
   have shown elevated incidence of dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy, and
   markers of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is beginning to emerge that
   implicates efavirenz (EFV) as a potential mediator of early on-set
   cardiovascular disease.
   Methods: Pediatric and adult HIV-infected HAART-naive, EFV-treated,
   nevirapine (NVP)-treated, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir
   (LPV/r)-treated subjects were recruited from Black Lion Hospital in
   Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid intima-media
   thickness (cIMT), carotid arterial stiffness, brachial artery
   flow-mediated dilation (FMD), body mass index, waist-to-hip
   circumference ratio, and skinfold thickness were measured. CD4+ cell
   count, fasting glucose, lipoprotein profiles and triglycerides were also
   determined. Results were segmented into pediatric (6-17 years of age),
   young adults (25-39 years old) and older adults (40-60 years old).
   Results: PWV was generally elevated in EFV- and LPV/r-treated subjects
   compared to NVP-treated subjects across age groups. cIMT was elevated in
   EFV- and LPV/r-treated compared to NVP-treated older adults and in
   EFV-treated compared to HAART-naive older adults. FMD was impaired in
   EFV- and LPV/r-treated compared to HAART-naive younger adults, in
   EFV-treated compared to NVP-treated young and older adults, and in
   LPV/r-treated compared to NVP-treated older adults. Differences in
   lipoprotein profiles and skinfold thickness with HAART regimen were
   observed in pediatric and young adults, but less so in older adults.
   Conclusions: Whereas LPV/r and other protease inhibitors have long been
   recognized as mediators of HIV/HAART-associated atherosclerosis, this
   report supports the emerging evidence that EFV may also mediate
   cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV on HAART. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Both environmental and economic factors have driven the development of
   recycling routes for the increasing amount of composite waste generated.
   This paper presents a new paradigm to fully recycle epoxy-based carbon
   fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. After immersing the
   composite in ethylene glycol (EG) and increasing the temperature, the
   epoxy matrix can be dissolved as the EG molecules participate in bond
   exchange reactions (BERs) within the covalent adaptable network (CAN),
   effectively breaking the long polymer chains into small segments. The
   clean carbon fibers can be then reclaimed with the same dimensions and
   mechanical properties as those of fresh ones. Both the dissolution rate
   and the minimum amount of EG required to fully dissolve the CAN are
   experimentally determined. Further heating the dissolved solution leads
   to repolymerization of the epoxy matrix, so a new generation of
   composite can be fabricated by using the recycled fiber and epoxy; in
   this way a closed-loop near 100\% recycling paradigm is realized. In
   addition, epoxy composites with surface damage are shown to be fully
   repaired. Both the recycled and the repaired composites exhibit the same

Abstract = {{While vanadium oxides have many attractive pseudocapacitive features for
   energy storage, their applications are severely limited by the poor
   electronic conductivity and low specific surface area. To overcome these
   limitations, a scalable, free-standing film electrode composed of
   intertwined V2O5 nanowires and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a blade
   coating process has been prepared. The unique architecture of this
   hybrid electrode greatly facilitates electronic transport along CNTs
   while maintaining rapid ion diffusion within V2O5 nanowires and fast
   electron transfer across the V2O5/CNTs interfaces. When tested in a
   neutral aqueous electrolyte, this hybrid film electrode demonstrates a
   volumetric capacitance of approximate to 460 F cm(-3). Moreover, a
   symmetric capacitor based on two identical film electrodes displays a
   wide operation voltage window of 1.6 V, delivering a volumetric energy
   density as high as 41 Wh L-1.}},

   composed of two colloidal particles separated by a small gap. This Focus
   Review discusses how colloidal stability can be strategically
   manipulated to induce dimerization, together with effective purification
   steps to further improve yields. We conclude the article by providing

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were deposited onto the monodispersed
   carboxylic polystyrene (CPS) spheres by an improved in situ reduction

   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. The surface enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) performances of the resulting uniform CPS/Ag hybrid
   particles were investigated using 4-aminobenzenethiol (4-ABT) as the
   probe molecule. The optimized CPS/Ag hybrid particles show high
   enhancement factor (EF) of 2.71x10(7), low limit of detection (LOD) of
   10(-10)m and good reproducibility with relative standard deviation (RSD)

Title = {{Patterns of Transcript Abundance of Eukaryotic Biogeochemically-Relevant
   Genes in the Amazon River Plume}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{The Amazon River has the largest discharge of all rivers on Earth, and
   its complex plume system fuels a wide array of biogeochemical processes,
   across a large area of the western tropical North Atlantic. The plume
   thus stimulates microbial processes affecting carbon sequestration and
   nutrient cycles at a global scale. Chromosomal gene expression patterns
   of the 2.0 to 156 mu m size-fraction eukaryotic microbial community were
   investigated in the Amazon River Plume, generating a robust dataset
   (more than 100 million mRNA sequences) that depicts the metabolic
   capabilities and interactions among the eukaryotic microbes. Combining
   classical oceanographic field measurements with metatranscriptomics
   yielded characterization of the hydrographic conditions simultaneous
   with a quantification of transcriptional activity and identity of the
   community. We highlight the patterns of eukaryotic gene expression for
   31 biogeochemically significant gene targets hypothesized to be valuable
   within forecasting models. An advantage to this targeted approach is
   that the database of reference sequences used to identify the target
   genes was selectively constructed and highly curated optimizing
   taxonomic coverage, throughput, and the accuracy of annotations. A
   coastal diatom bloom highly expressed nitrate transporters and carbonic
   anhydrase presumably to support high growth rates and enhance uptake of
   low levels of dissolved nitrate and CO2. Diatom-diazotroph association
   (DDA: diatoms with nitrogen fixing symbionts) blooms were common when
   surface salinity was mesohaline and dissolved nitrate concentrations
   were below detection, and hence did not show evidence of nitrate
   utilization, suggesting they relied on ammonium transporters to aquire
   recently fixed nitrogen. These DDA blooms in the outer plume had rapid
   turnover of the photosystem D1 protein presumably caused by
   photodegradation under increased light penetration in clearer waters,
   and increased expression of silicon transporters as silicon became
   limiting. Expression of these genes, including carbonic anhydrase and
   transporters for nitrate and phosphate, were found to reflect the
   physiological status and biogeochemistry of river plume environments.
   These relatively stable patterns of eukaryotic transcript abundance
   occurred over modest spatiotemporal scales, with similarity observed in
   sample duplicates collected up to 2.45 km in space and 120 minutes in
   time. These results confirm the use of metatranscriptomics as a valuable
   tool to understand and predict microbial community function.}},

   Triboelectrification-Induced Potential Oscillation}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A biocide-free antifouling method on wetted insulating surfaces, enabled
   by the oscillation of electric potential generated by an integrated
   triboelectric wave harvester (I-TEWH) is reported. Distinct from
   previous studies that reported antifouling on conducting surfaces by
   applying an additional power source, this method achieves antifouling on
   insulating surfaces with zero-power consumption. The electric potential
   in the vicinity of a protected surface oscillates in large amplitude as
   a result of periodically accumulated free electrons on an underlying
   electrode. The dynamic flow of the free electrons is driven by the
   I-TEWH that converts ambient wave energy by solid-liquid interface
   triboelectrification. As a consequence, the oscillating electric
   potential disturbs the inherent charge distribution on microbes due to
   electrostatic induction, preventing their initial adhesion onto the
   protected surface and thus prohibiting the subsequent formation of
   macroorganisms. Significant anti-adhesion efficiencies of as high as
   99.3\%, 99.1\%, and 96.0\% are achieved for negative-gram bacteria
   (Escherichia coli), positive-gram bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), and
   diatoms (bacillariophyceze), respectively, on a smooth surface. The
   antifouling efficiency on a roughened surface with micro/nanostructures
   can be further enhanced by another 75\%. This approach can be
   potentially utilized in coastal constructions, offshore facilities, and
   vessels that are either moving or stationary in port.}},

Title = {{Control traffic balancing in software defined networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{260-271}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{To promise on-line and adaptive traffic engineering in software defined
   networks (SDNs), the control messages, e.g., the first packet of every
   new flow and network traffic statistics, should be forwarded from
   software defined switches to the controller(s) in a fast and robust
   manner. As many signaling events and control plane operations are
   required in SDNs, they could easily generate a significant amount of
   control traffic that must be addressed together with the data traffic.
   However, the usage of in-band control channel imposes a great challenge
   into timely and reliable transmissions of control traffic, while
   out-band control is usually cost-prohibitive. To counter this, in this
   paper, the control traffic balancing problem is first formulated as a
   nonlinear optimization framework with an objective to find the optimal
   control traffic forwarding paths for each switch in such a way the
   average control traffic delay in the whole network is minimized. This
   problem is extremely critical in SDNs because the timely delivery of
   control traffic initiated by Openflow switches directly impacts the
   effectiveness of the routing strategies. Specifically, the fundamental
   mathematical structures of the formulated nonlinear problem and solution
   set are provided and accordingly, an efficient algorithm, called
   polynomial-time approximation algorithm (PTAA), is proposed to yield the
   fast convergence to a near optimal solution by employing the alternating
   direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, the optimal
   controller placement problem in in-band mode is examined, which aims to
   find the optimal switch location where the controller can be collocated
   by minimizing the control message delay. While it is not widely
   researched except quantitative or heuristic results, a simple and
   efficient algorithm is proposed to guarantee the optimum placement with
   regards of traffic statistics. Simulation results confirm that the
   proposed PTAA achieves considerable delay reduction, greatly
   facilitating controller's traffic engineering in large-scale SDNs. (C)

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Two donor polymers containing thiophene (T) and thienothiophene (TT) as
   the electron rich, and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the electron poor,
   moieties were synthesized and utilized in organic photovoltaic (OPV)
   devices. We appended n-decyl side chains onto the thiophenes directly
   adjacent to the di-hexyldecyl substituted DPP center core to ensure
   solubility of the resulting polymers. We observed the impact of active
   layer morphologies, as determined by grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray
   scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), on solar cell
   characteristics. Compared to devices fabricated with the
   thiophene-containing polymer P(T-DPP), devices with
   poly(thienothiophene-alt-diketopyrrolopyrrole), P(TT-DPP), exhibited
   higher average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.0\% and short
   circuit current (J(sc)) of 10.4 mA/cm(2). This higher performance is
   attributed to an improved charge transport and extraction as a result of
   a greater degree of intermixing in P(TT-DPP) and fullerene thin film.

Abstract = {{When a product is a complex dynamic system that interacts directly with
   a human, engineers must consider a wide range of possible motions and
   forces that the device could exert on the human. Such an analysis goes
   beyond a simple thought exercise and requires detailed knowledge about
   the system dynamics and the operating environment. This paper presents
   such an analysis of inverted-pendulum human transporters. The list of
   hazards is constructed by using knowledge of the dynamics and mechanical
   design obtained through simulation and experimentation. However, the
   dynamics are so complex that the list is augmented with hazards that are
   revealed by studying accident videos posted on the Internet. The
   severity of the hazards is estimated using an energy-based measurement
   of the hazard onset conditions as well as compounding factors from the
   mechanical design. In addition, experimental and simulation results of
   sample hazard conditions illustrate their danger and severity. The
   analysis reveals that inverted-pendulum human transporters have several
   hazards with unacceptable risk.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{In modeling and simulation, model-form uncertainty arises from the lack
   of knowledge and simplification during the modeling process and
   numerical treatment for ease of computation. Traditional uncertainty
   quantification (UQ) approaches are based on assumptions of stochasticity
   in real, reciprocal, or functional spaces to make them computationally
   tractable. This makes the prediction of important quantities of
   interest, such as rare events, difficult. In this paper, a new approach
   to capture model-form uncertainty is proposed. It is based on fractional
   calculus, and its flexibility allows us to model a family of
   non-Gaussian processes, which provides a more generic description of the
   physical world. A generalized fractional Fokker-Planck equation (fFPE)
   is used to describe the drift-diffusion processes under long-range
   correlations and memory effects. A new model-calibration approach based
   on the maximum mutual information is proposed to reduce model-form
   uncertainty, where an optimization procedure is taken.}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal oxide-based electrodes for lithium ion batteries have
   recently attracted much attention because of their high theoretical
   capacity. Here we report the electrochemical behavior of cobalt oxide
   nanorods as anodes, prepared by a template-free, one-step
   electrochemical deposition of cobalt nanorods, followed by an oxidation
   process. The as-deposited cobalt has a slightly convex columnar
   structure, and controlled thermal oxidation produces cobalt oxides of
   different Co/O ratios, while the original shape is largely preserved. As
   an anode in a rechargeable lithium battery, the Co/O ratio has a strong
   effect on initial capacity and cycling stability. In particular, the
   one-dimensional Co@CoxOy core shell structure obtained from a mild
   heat-treatment results in superior cycling stability.}},

Title = {{MEMS based nanomechanical testing method with independent electronic
   sensing of stress and strain}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{167-176}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We report significant improvements in the sensing scheme of a
   microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based nanomechanical tensile
   testing technique that has been previously demonstrated to allow direct
   microstructural observations inside a transmission electron microscope
   (TEM) at high magnifications while simultaneously measuring the stress
   and strain in the sample electronically. The particularity of the MEMS
   device is the presence of two capacitive sensors on either side of a
   specimen gap (across which nanostructures like nanowires and thin films
   can be manipulated and clamped), allowing independent measurement of
   applied load (stress) and crosshead displacement (strain). The
   improvement in the sensing technique lies in the independent, separate
   measurements of the signals from the two capacitive sensors (as opposed
   to the previous technique based on the differential measurement between
   the two sensors). The new technique (called technique 2 in this paper)
   provides independent electronic sensing of stress and strain without
   making any assumption about the material behavior and opens up the
   possibility of doing force controlled tests. The new sensing technique
   is demonstrated and compared to the previous one (called technique 1 in
   this paper) by performing ex-situ monotonic and stress relaxation tests
   on freestanding 100-nm-thick Au films. Important practical matters such
   as specimen clamping and signal drift are also discussed. (C) 2016

Title = {{Gradient plasticity in gradient nano-grained metals}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{213-219}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Gradient nano-grained (GNG) metals are a unique class of materials with
   spatial gradients in grain size, typically from the surface to the bulk.
   Here the gradient mechanical behavior in GNG copper is studied by a
   crystal plasticity finite element model that accounts for
   grain-size-dependent yield strengths. The associated finite element
   simulations reveal both the gradient stress and gradient plastic strain
   in the cross section of GNG copper subjected to axial tension. These
   spatial gradients arise due to progressive yielding of gradient grains
   under an overall uniform deformation. They stand in stark contrast to
   the widely studied strain gradient plasticity induced by imposing a
   non-uniform deformation such as torsion, bending, and indentation. Our
   work suggests a new material strengthening mechanism through the
   introduction of plastic strain gradients via gradient microstructures.

Abstract = {{Despite major advances in targeted drug therapy and radiation therapy,
   surgery remains the most effective treatment for most solid tumors. The
   single most important predictor of patient survival is a complete
   surgical resection of the primary tumor, draining lymph nodes, and
   metastatic lesions. Presently, however, 20\%-30\% of patients with head
   and neck cancer who undergo surgery still leave the operating room
   without complete resection because of missed lesions. Thus, major
   opportunities exist to develop advanced imaging tracers and
   intraoperative instrumentation that would allow surgeons to visualize
   microscopic tumors during surgery. The cell adhesion molecule integrin
   alpha v beta 3 is specifically expressed by tumor neovasculature and
   invading tumor cells, but not by quiescent vessels or normal cells. Here
   we report the combined use of an integrintargeting near-infrared tracer
   (RGD-IRDye800CW) and a handheld spectroscopic device, an integrated
   point spectroscopy with wide-field imaging system, for highly sensitive
   detection of integrin overexpression on infiltrating cancer cells. By
   using an orthotopic head and neck cancer animal model, we show that this
   tracerdevice combination allows intraoperative detection of not only
   invasive tumor margins but also metastatic lymph nodes. Correlated
   histological analysis further reveals that microscopic clusters of
   50-100 tumor cells can be detected intraoperatively with high
   sensitivity and specificity, raising new possibilities in guiding
   surgical resection of microscopic tumors and metastatic lymph nodes.}},

Abstract = {{The number of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the electric grid is growing
   at an unprecedented speed. This is rapidly transforming the ways in
   which the traditional distribution grid is being planned and operated. A
   problem faced by utilities is that, in many cases, the PV system
   installed does not correspond to the size or type filed with the
   installation permit, or simply the installation took place without a
   permit. In order to maintain grid reliability and safety, utilities must
   be able to detect and monitor all PV installations in their network.
   This paper proposes a data-driven approach for the detection,
   verification, and estimation of residential PV system installations. We
   use a change-point detection algorithm to screen out abnormal energy
   consumption behaviors including unauthorized PV installations. Then the
   existence of the unauthorized PV installation is further verified
   through a statistical inference known as permutation test with
   Spearman's rank coefficient. The proposed hypothesis test takes the
   customer's load profiles before and after the detected change-point as
   inputs, which are estimated through Gaussian kernel density method.
   Finally, the local cloud cover index is integrated with smart meter
   measurements to estimate the size of the PV system. The proposed method
   has been tested and validated with actual smart meter measurements under
   several scenarios.}},

   temporal, and spatial information to identify the event. To improve the
   accuracy of outage detection, we propose a supervised topic model with a
   heterogeneous information network. The proposed technique is tested with
   real tweets and outage cases. The numerical results demonstrate the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating simultaneously
   low-rank and row-wise sparse matrices from nested linear measurements,
   where the linear operator consists of the product of a linear operator W
   and a matrix Psi. Leveraging the nested structure of the measurement
   operator, we propose a computationally efficient two-stage algorithm for
   estimating the simultaneously structured target matrix. Assuming that W
   is a restricted isometry for low-rank matrices and Psi is a restricted
   isometry for row-wise sparse matrices, we establish an accuracy
   guarantee that holds uniformly for all sufficiently low-rank and
   row-wise sparse matrices with high probability. Furthermore, using
   standard tools from information theory, we establish a minimax lower
   bound for estimation of simultaneously low-rank and row-wise sparse
   matrices from linear measurements that need not be nested. The accuracy
   bounds established for the algorithm, that also serve as a minimax upper
   bound, differ from the derived minimax lower bound merely by a
   polylogarithmic factor of the dimensions. Therefore, the proposed
   algorithm is nearly minimax optimal. We also discuss some applications
   of the proposed observation model and evaluate our algorithm through
   numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{ability to predict how different individuals will respond to vaccination
   and to understand what best protects individuals from infection greatly
   facilitates developing next-generation vaccines. It facilitates both the
   rapid design and evaluation of new and emerging vaccines and identifies
   individuals unlikely to be protected by vaccine. We describe a
   general-purpose machine-learning framework, DAMIP, for discovering gene
   signatures that can predict vaccine immunity and efficacy. DAMIP is a
   multiple-group, concurrent classifier that offers unique features not
   present in other models: a nonlinear data transformation to manage the
   curse of dimensionality and noise; a reserved-judgment region that
   handles fuzzy entities; and constraints on the allowed percentage of
   misclassifications.
   Using DAMIP, implemented results for yellow fever demonstrated that, for
   the first time, a vaccine's ability to immunize a patient could be
   successfully predicted (with accuracy of greater than 90 percent) within
   one week after vaccination. A gene identified by DAMIP, EIF2AK4,
   decrypted a seven-decade-old mystery of vaccination. Results for flu
   vaccine demonstrated DAMIP's applicability to both live-attenuated and
   inactivated vaccines. Results in a malaria study enabled targeted
   delivery to individual patients.
   Our project's methods and findings permit highlighting and
   probabilistically prioritizing hypothesis design to enhance biological
   discovery. Moreover, they guide the rapid development of better vaccines
   to fight emerging infections, and improve monitoring for poor responses
   in the elderly, infants, or others with weakened immune systems. In
   addition, the project's work should help with universal flu-vaccine
   design.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The hypothesis that outdoor exposure might protect against
   myopia has generated much interest, although available data find only
   modest clinical efficacy. We tested the effect of outdoor rearing on
   form-deprivation myopia in chicks, a myopia model markedly inhibited by
   high-intensity indoor laboratory lighting.
   METHODS. Unilaterally goggled cohorts of White Leghorn chicks were
   maintained in a species-appropriate, outdoor rural setting during
   daylight hours to the extent permitted by weather. Control chicks were
   reared indoors with incandescent lighting. Besides ocular refraction and
   ultrasound, we determined dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
   (DOPAC) content in retina and vitreous and measured mRNA expression
   levels of selected clock and circadian rhythm-related genes in the
   retina/RPE.
   RESULTS. Myopia developed in the goggled eyes of all cohorts. Whereas
   outdoor rearing lessened myopia by 44\% at 4 days, a protective effect
   was no longer evident at 11 days. Outdoor rearing had no consistent
   effect on retinal or vitreous content of dopamine or DOPAC. Conforming
   to prior data on form-deprivation myopia, retina and vitreous levels of
   DOPAC were reduced in goggled eyes. Compared with contralateral eyes,
   the retinal expression of clock and circadian rhythm-related genes was
   modestly altered in myopic eyes of chicks reared indoors or outdoors.
   CONCLUSIONS. Outdoor rearing of chicks induces only a partial decrease
   of goggle-induced myopia that is not maintained, without evidence that
   retinal dopamine metabolism accounts for the partial myopia inhibition
   under these outdoor conditions. Although modest, alterations in retinal
   gene expression suggest that studying circadian signals might be
   informative for understanding refractive mechanisms.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The year 2015 marked the 25th anniversary of modern ultrafast optics,
   since the demonstration of the first Kerr lens modelocked Ti:sapphire
   laser in 1990 (Spence et al 1990 Conf. on Lasers and Electro-Optics,
   CLEO, pp 619-20) heralded an explosion of scientific and engineering
   innovation. The impact of this disruptive technology extended well
   beyond the previous discipline boundaries of lasers, reaching into
   biology labs, manufacturing facilities, and even consumer healthcare and
   electronics. In recognition of such a milestone, this roadmap on
   Ultrafast Optics draws together articles from some of the key opinion
   leaders in the field to provide a freeze-frame of the state-of-the-art,
   while also attempting to forecast the technical and scientific paradigms
   which will define the field over the next 25 years. While no roadmap can
   be fully comprehensive, the thirteen articles here reflect the most
   exciting technical opportunities presented at the current time in
   Ultrafast Optics. Several articles examine the future landscape for
   ultrafast light sources, from practical solid-state/fiber lasers and
   Raman microresonators to exotic attosecond extreme ultraviolet and
   possibly even zeptosecond x-ray pulses. Others address the control and
   measurement challenges, requiring radical approaches to harness
   nonlinear effects such as filamentation and parametric generation,
   coupled with the question of how to most accurately characterise the
   field of ultrafast pulses simultaneously in space and time. Applications
   of ultrafast sources in materials processing, spectroscopy and
   time-resolved chemistry are also discussed, highlighting the
   improvements in performance possible by using lasers of higher peak
   power and repetition rate, or by exploiting the phase stability of
   emerging new frequency comb sources.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoarchitected Cu-Si core-shell lattices were fabricated via two-photon
   lithography and tested as mechanically robust Li-ion battery electrodes
   which accommodate similar to 250\% Si volume expansion during
   lithiation. The superior mechanical performance of the nanolattice
   electrodes is directly observed using an in situ scanning electron
   microscope, which allows volume expansion and morphological changes to
   be imaged at multiple length scales, from single lattice beam to the
   architecture level, during electrochemical testing. Finite element
   modeling of lithiation-induced volume expansion in a core-shell
   structure reveals that geometry and plasticity mechanisms play a
   critical role in preventing damage in the nanolattice electrodes. The
   two-photon lithography-based fabrication method combined with
   computational modeling and in situ characterization capabilities would
   potentially enable the rational design and fast discovery of
   mechanically robust and kinetically agile electrode materials that
   independently optimize geometry, feature size, porosity, surface area,
   and chemical composition, as well as other functional devices in which

   High laminar shear stress (LS) found in straight lumen exerts
   athero-protective effects. Low or oscillatory shear stress (OS) present
   in regions of lesser curvature and arterial bifurcations predisposes
   arterial intima to atherosclerosis. Shear stress-regulated endothelial
   function plays an important role in the process of atherosclerosis. Most
   in vitro research studies focusing on the molecular mechanisms of
   endothelial function are performed in endothelial cells (ECs) under
   cultured static (ST) condition. Some findings, however, are not
   recapitulated in subsequent translational studies, mostly likely due to
   the missing biomechanical milieu. Here, we profiled the whole
   transcriptome of primary human coronary arterial endothelial cells
   (HCAECs) under different shear stress conditions with RNA sequencing.
   Among 16,313 well-expressed genes, we detected 8,177 that were
   differentially expressed in OS vs. LS conditions and 9,369 in ST vs. LS
   conditions. Notably, only 1,618 were differentially expressed in OS vs.
   ST conditions. Hierarchical clustering of ECs demonstrated a strong
   similarity between ECs under OS and ST conditions at the transcriptome
   level. Subsequent pairwise heat mapping and principal component analysis
   gave further weight to the similarity. At the individual gene level,
   expressional analysis of representative well-known genes as well as
   novel genes showed a comparable amount at mRNA and protein levels in ECs
   under ST and OS conditions. In conclusion, the present work compared the
   whole transcriptome of HCAECs under different shear stress conditions at
   the transcriptome level as well as at the individual gene level. We
   found that cultured ECs are significantly different from those under LS
   conditions. Thus using cells under ST conditions is unlikely to
   elucidate endothelial physiology. Given the revealed high similarities
   of the endothelial transcriptome under OS and ST conditions, it may be
   helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms of OS-induced
   endothelial dysfunction from static cultured endothelial studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose Segugio, a novel defense system that allows
   for efficiently tracking the occurrence of new malware-control domain
   names in very large ISP networks. Segugio passively monitors the DNS
   traffic to build a machine-domain bipartite graph representing who is
   querying what. After labeling nodes in this query behavior graph that
   are known to be either benign or malware-related, we propose a novel
   approach to accurately detect previously unknown malware-control
   domains.
   We implemented a proof-of-concept version of Segugio and deployed it in
   large ISP networks that serve millions of users. Our experimental
   results show that Segugio can track the occurrence of new
   malware-control domains with up to 94\% true positives (TPs) at less
   than 0.1\% false positives (FPs). In addition, we provide the following
   results: (1) we show that Segugio can also detect control domains
   related to new, previously unseen malware families, with 85\% TPs at
   0.1\% FPs; (2) Segugio's detection models learned on traffic from a
   given ISP network can be deployed into a different ISP network and still
   achieve very high detection accuracy; (3) new malware-control domains
   can be detected days or even weeks before they appear in a large
   commercial domain-name blacklist; (4) Segugio can be used to detect
   previously unknown malware-infected machines in ISP networks; and (5) we
   show that Segugio clearly outperforms domain-reputation systems based on
   Belief Propagation.}},

Abstract = {{The Georgia Institute of Technology Prox-1 mission will demonstrate

   Automated maneuver planning and execution uses a guidance algorithm

Abstract = {{Reuse of concrete debris as a component of structural concrete is
   important both economically and environmentally. In resource-poor
   regions, using construction debris may facilitate economic, rapid,
   material sourcing and debris disposal if it demonstrates adequate
   structural performance. To investigate the seismic resistance of
   structural elements with recycled concrete aggregate, this research
   performs quasi-static cyclic testing on four full-scale reinforced
   concrete columns-two containing natural aggregate and two containing
   recycled concrete aggregate-under both axial and lateral loads. For each
   aggregate source, reinforcement detailing in one column conformed to the
   seismic provisions in the International Building Code, while the
   detailing in the other column conformed to nonseismic design
   specifications. A pre-experimental numerical model for each column was
   created in OpenSees to predict the behavior of the column. Experimental
   and numerical results verify that seismically designed columns made of
   either natural aggregate concrete or recycled aggregate concrete show
   similar cyclic lateral behavior.}},

   were analyzed from 27 women who underwent four IRB approved NIRST/DBT
   exams that included fully and mildly compressed breast acquisitions in
   two projections-craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral-oblique (MLO)-and
   generated four data sets per patient (full and moderate compression in

   0.001), water (r = 0.62, p = 0.003), and lipid concentrations (r =
   -0.74, p < 0.001), but not oxygen saturation. CC and MLO views were
   correlated for individual subjects and demonstrated no statistically
   significant differences in grouped analysis. Comparison of compressed

   well-defined \{100\} facets on the nanocrystals and also increased
   batch-to-batch reproducibility without the use of a glove box or similar

Abstract = {{In this work we present a strain field mining methodology where the
   intensities and spatial distributions of strains in double lap strap
   epoxy (EA 9394) bonded joints are measured, analysed and correlated with
   bond strength. While the global behaviour of the bonded joints was
   linear elastic at room temperature, discrete regions of elevated
   (relative to the full field average) shear strains were observed. The
   size, spatial distribution and other features of these strain `hot
   spots' were described with a metric called the homogeneity index. This
   index captures the uniformity of the strain field with respect to
   regions of positive and negative strain at a specific stress level. The
   linearity of the progression of the homogeneity index and its magnitude
   was correlated with a joint's fracture strength and failure mode. The
   index was a robust predictor of double-lap strap bonded joint
   performance between 30\% and 90\% of a specimen's strength and can be
   used to improve joint design, manufacturing, quality assurance,
   maintenance and inspection.}},

Abstract = {{Although beta-blockers can be used to eliminate stress-induced
   ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic
   ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), this treatment is unsuccessful in
   similar to 25\% of cases. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
   cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from these patients have potential
   for use in investigating the phenomenon, but it remains unknown whether
   they can recapitulate patient-specific drug responses to beta-blockers.
   This study assessed whether the inadequacy of beta-blocker therapy in an
   individual can be observed in vitro using patient-derived CPVT iPSC-CMs.
   An individual with CPVT harboring a novel mutation in the type 2 cardiac
   ryanodine receptor (RyR2) was identified whose persistent ventricular
   arrhythmias during beta-blockade with nadolol were abolished during
   flecainide treatment. iPSC-CMs generated from this patient and two
   control individuals expressed comparable levels of
   excitation-contraction genes, but assessment of the sarcoplasmic
   reticulum Ca2+ leak and load relationship revealed intracellular Ca2+
   homeostasis was altered in the CPVT iPSC-CMs. beta-adrenergic
   stimulation potentiated spontaneous Ca2+ waves and unduly frequent,
   large and prolonged Ca2+ sparks in CPVT compared with control iPSC-CMs,
   validating the disease phenotype. Pursuant to the patient's in vivo
   responses, nadolol treatment during beta-adrenergic stimulation achieved
   negligible reduction of Ca2+ wave frequency and failed to rescue Ca2+
   spark defects in CPVT iPSC-CMs. In contrast, flecainide reduced both
   frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ waves and restored the frequency, width
   and duration of Ca2+ sparks to baseline levels. By recapitulating the
   improved response of an individual with CPVT to flecainide compared with
   beta-blocker therapy in vitro, these data provide newevidence that
   iPSC-CMs can capture basic components of patient-specific drug
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Currently used surgical techniques to reconstruct tissue defects after
   resection of musculoskeletal tumours are associated with high
   complication rates. This drives a strong demand for innovative
   therapeutic concepts that are able to improve the clinical outcomes of
   patients suffering from bone and soft tissue tumours. Tissue engineering
   and regenerative medicine (TE\&RM) provides a technology platform based
   on biochemical, molecular, cellular and biomaterials modules to
   selectively direct tissue healing processes for improved defect
   regeneration. At the same time, precautionary measures have to be taken
   when these instruments are used in cancer patients to prevent any
   promotion of tumour growth or metastatic spread. On the other hand,
   several innovative TE\&RM tools are being developed such as
   multi-functionalized biomaterials, drug-delivering nanomaterials or
   genetically engineered stem cells that per se have the potential to
   mediate anti-cancer effects, act synergistically with currently used
   chemotherapeutics and/or radiotherapy regimens and reduce their side
   effects. Recently, scientists became conscious that TE\&RM strategies
   may not only be utilized to advance contemporary tissue reconstruction
   techniques but also to develop personalized diagnostic tools and
   clinically relevant disease models for cancer patients. Eventually,
   prospective randomized clinical trials combined with comparative outcome
   analyses are a conditio sine qua non to shape the benefits of
   personalized regenerative therapies for the standardized management of
   patients with musculoskeletal tumours.}},

Abstract = {{Wall shear stress (WSS) has been investigated as a prognostic marker for
   the prospective identification of rapidly progressing coronary artery
   disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic lesions likely to gain high-risk
   (vulnerable) characteristics. The goal of this study was to compare
   biplane angiographic vs. intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) derived
   reconstructed coronary geometries to evaluate agreement in geometry,
   computed WSS, and association of WSS and CAD progression. Baseline and
   6-month follow-up angiographic and IVUS imaging data were collected in
   patients with non-obstructive CAD (n = 5). Three-dimensional (3D)
   reconstructions of the coronary arteries were generated with each
   technique, and patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models were
   constructed to compute baseline WSS values. Geometric comparisons were
   evaluated in arterial segments (n = 9), and hemodynamic data were
   evaluated in circumferential sections (n = 468). CAD progression was
   quantified from serial IVUS imaging data (n = 277), and included
   virtual-histology IVUS (VH-IVUS) derived changes in plaque composition.
   There was no significant difference in reconstructed coronary segment
   lengths and cross-sectional areas (CSA), however, IVUS derived
   geometries exhibited a significantly larger left main CSA than the
   angiographic reconstructions. Computed absolute time-averaged WSS
   (TAWSS(ABS)) values were significantly greater in the IVUS derived
   geometries, however, evaluations of relative TAWSS (TAWSS(REL)) values
   revealed improved agreement and differences within defined zones of
   equivalence. Associations between VH-IVUS defined CAD progression and
   angiographic or IVUS derived WSS exhibited poor agreement when examining
   TAWSS(ABS) data, but improved when evaluating the association with
   TAWSS(REL) data. We present data from a small cohort of patients
   highlighting strong agreement between angiographic and IVUS derived
   coronary geometries, however, limited agreement is observed between
   computed WSS values and associations of WSS with CAD progression.}},

Abstract = {{Sloping coastal aquifers in reality are ubiquitous and well documented.
   Steady state sharp-interface analytical solutions for describing
   seawater intrusion in sloping confined and unconfined coastal aquifers
   are developed based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation.
   Specifically, analytical solutions based on the constant-flux inland
   boundary condition are derived by solving the discharge equation for the
   interface zone with the continuity conditions of the head and flux
   applied at the interface between the freshwater zone and the interface
   zone. Analytical solutions for the constant-head inland boundary are
   then obtained by developing the relationship between the inland
   freshwater flux and hydraulic head and combining this relationship with
   the solutions of the constant-flux inland boundary. It is found that for
   the constant-flux inland boundary, the shape of the saltwater interface
   is independent of the geometry of the bottom confining layer for both
   aquifer types, despite that the geometry of the bottom confining layer
   determines the location of the interface tip. This is attributed to that
   the hydraulic head at the interface is identical to that of the coastal
   boundary, so the shape of the bed below the interface is irrelevant to
   the interface position. Moreover, developed analytical solutions with an
   empirical factor on the density factor are in good agreement with the
   results of variable-density flow numerical modeling. Analytical
   solutions developed in this study provide a powerful tool for assessment
   of seawater intrusion in sloping coastal aquifers as well as in coastal
   aquifers with a known freshwater flux but an arbitrary geometry of the
   bottom confining layer.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetic recording promises to increase areal density
   through the joint detection of multiple tracks of interest. This paper
   concerns the problem of joint detection of multiple tracks that are
   written asynchronously, meaning that neither the bit boundaries (phase)
   nor the bit rate (frequency) are aligned between neighboring tracks. We
   propose the rotating-target algorithm for jointly detecting multiple
   asynchronous tracks from one or more readback waveforms. The proposed
   approach is based on the joint Viterbi algorithm and a time-varying
   target that results when the asynchrony of the tracks is absorbed into
   the underlying target. Timing estimation for the tracks being detected
   is embedded inside the joint Viterbi detector using per-survivor
   processing. Performance results show that the proposed algorithm closely
   matches the performance of a fictitious system in which neighboring
   tracks are synchronous, and further that it significantly outperforms a
   previously reported detector that separately detects the two tracks.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillatory neurons integrate their synaptic inputs in fundamentally
   different ways than normally quiescent neurons. We show that the
   oscillation period of invertebrate endogenous pacemaker neurons wanders,
   producing random fluctuations in the inter-spike intervals (ISI) on a
   time scale of seconds to minutes, which decorrelates pairs of neurons in
   hybrid circuits constructed using the dynamic clamp. The autocorrelation
   of the ISI sequence remained high for many ISIs, but the autocorrelation
   of the Delta ISI series had on average a single nonzero value, which was
   negative at a lag of one interval. We reproduced these results using a
   simple integrate and fire (IF) model with a stochastic population of
   channels carrying an adaptation current with a stochastic component that
   was integrated with a slow time scale, suggesting that a similar
   population of channels underlies the observed wander in the period.
   Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, we found
   that a single integrator and a single moving average with a negative
   coefficient could simulate both the experimental data and the IF model.
   Feeding white noise into an integrator with a slow time constant is
   sufficient to produce the autocorrelation structure of the ISI series.
   Moreover, the moving average clearly accounted for the autocorrelation
   structure of the Delta ISI series and is biophysically implemented in
   the IF model using slow stochastic adaptation. The observed
   autocorrelation structure may be a neural signature of slow stochastic
   adaptation, and wander generated in this manner may be a general
   mechanism for limiting episodes of synchronized activity in the nervous
   system.}},

Title = {{Estimation of Directed Acyclic Graphs Through Two-Stage Adaptive Lasso

Abstract = {{Graphical models are a popular approach to find dependence and
   conditional independence relationships between gene expressions.
   Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a special class of directed,
   graphical models, where all the edges are directed edges and contain. no
   directed cycles. The DAGs are well known models for discovering causal
   relationships between genes in gene regulatory networks. However,
   estimating DAGs without assuming known ordering is challenging due to
   high dimensionality, the acyclic constraints, and the presence of
   equivalence class from observational data. To overcome these challenges,
   we propose a two stage adaptive Lasso approach, called NS-DIST, which
   performs neighborhood selection (NS) in stage 1, and then estimates DAGs
   by the discrete improving search with Tabu (DIST) algorithm within the
   selected neighborhood. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the method and its computational efficiency. Two
   real data examples are used to demonstrate the practical usage of our
   method for gene regulatory network inference. Supplementary materials
   for this article are available online.}},

Title = {{Fabrication and Microassembly of a mm-Sized Floating Probe for a
   Distributed Wireless Neural Interface}},
Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A new class of wireless neural interfaces is under development in the
   form of tens to hundreds of mm-sized untethered implants, distributed
   across the target brain region(s). Unlike traditional interfaces that
   are tethered to a centralized control unit and suffer from micromotions
   that may damage the surrounding neural tissue, the new free-floating
   wireless implantable neural recording (FF-WINeR) probes will be
   stand-alone, directly communicating with an external interrogator.
   Towards development of the FF-WINeR, in this paper we describe the
   micromachining, microassembly, and hermetic packaging of 1-mm(3) passive
   probes, each of which consists of a thinned micromachined silicon die
   with a centered O(diameter) 130 m through-hole, an O81 m sharpened
   tungsten electrode, a 7-turn gold wire-wound coil wrapped around the
   die, two 0201 surface mount capacitors on the die, and
   parylene-C/Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating. The fabricated passive
   probe is tested under a 3-coil inductive link to evaluate power transfer
   efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to a load (PDL) for feasibility
   assessment. The minimum PTE/PDL at 137 MHz were 0.76\%/240 W and
   0.6\%/191 W in the air and lamb head medium, respectively, with coil
   separation of 2.8 cm and 9 k receiver (Rx) loading. Six hermetically
   sealed probes went through wireless hermeticity testing, using a 2-coil
   inductive link under accelerated lifetime testing condition of 85
   degrees C, 1 atm, and 100\%RH. The mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of the
   probes at 37 degrees C is extrapolated to be 28.7 years, which is over
   their lifetime.}},

Title = {{A polyvalent inactivated rhinovirus vaccine is broadly immunogenic in

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{As the predominant aetiological agent of the common cold, human
   rhinovirus (HRV) is the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early
   studies showed that a monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be
   protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with
   protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged
   further vaccine efforts. Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing
   virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine may result in
   broad nAb responses. We show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus
   types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel
   (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and
   50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to
   sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major
   factor for potency or breadth of the response. Thus, we have generated a
   vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV
   types.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial resolution, spectral contrast and occlusion are three major
   bottlenecks for non-invasive inspection of complex samples with current
   imaging technologies. We exploit the sub-picosecond time resolution
   along with spectral resolution provided by terahertz time-domain
   spectroscopy to computationally extract occluding content from layers
   whose thicknesses are wavelength comparable. The method uses the
   statistics of the reflected terahertz electric field at subwavelength
   gaps to lock into each layer position and then uses a time-gated
   spectral kurtosis to tune to highest spectral contrast of the content on
   that specific layer. To demonstrate, occluding textual content was
   successfully extracted from a packed stack of paper pages down to nine
   pages without human supervision. The method provides over an order of
   magnitude enhancement in the signal contrast and can impact inspection
   of structural defects in wooden objects, plastic components, composites,

Abstract = {{Harvesting biomechanical energy is an important route for providing

   electrode, the TENG has desirable features including flexibility,
   stretchability, isotropy, weavability, water-resistance and a high
   surface charge density of 250 mu Cm-2. With only the energy extracted
   from walking or jogging by the TENG that is built in outsoles, wearable

Abstract = {{This work presents the uncertainty quantification, which includes
   parametric inference along with uncertainty propagation, for CO2
   adsorption in a hollow fiber sorbent, a complex dynamic chemical
   process. Parametric inference via Bayesian approach is performed using
   Sequential Monte Carlo, a completely parallel algorithm, and the
   predictions are obtained by propagating the posterior distribution
   through the model. The presence of residual variability in the observed
   data and model inadequacy often present a significant challenge in
   performing the parametric inference. In this work, residual variability
   in the observed data is handled by three different approaches: (a) by
   performing inference with isolated data sets, (b) by increasing the
   uncertainty in model parameters, and finally, (c) by using a model
   discrepancy term to account for the uncertainty. The pros and cons of
   each of the three approaches are illustrated along with the predicted
   distributions of CO2 breakthrough capacity for a scaled-up process. (C)

Journal = {{ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{283-297}},

Abstract = {{The ``setting-less{''} protection approach is an innovative protection
   scheme with increased dependability and security. This method is based
   on dynamic state estimation, which continuously extracts the operating
   condition of a protection zone from real-time measurements and the
   protection zone dynamic model. The dynamic state estimation computes the
   probability that the measurements fit the dynamic model of the
   protection zone within the measurement accuracy via the Chi-square test.
   The probability represents the goodness of fit of measurements to the
   dynamic model of the protection zone. We refer to it as the confidence
   level that the protection zone is healthy. High confidence levels imply
   that the protection zone operates normally, while low confidence levels
   indicate that internal abnormalities/faults may have occurred. Note that
   the proposed method does not require coordination with other protection
   schemes which sometimes compromise security and/or dependability. In
   this paper, the setting-less protection approach is described and
   applied to transformer protection. The feasibility of the setting-less
   transformer protection is verified with numerical experiments of several
   case studies (e.g., transformer energization, external faults, internal
   faults, and high impedance faults). The method has been verified in the
   laboratory and there are plans for field testing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel built-in tuning technique to compensate for
   process variability-induced imperfections in RF circuits is proposed.
   The yield improvement methodology proposed is a generic and
   self-contained tuning method that does not require a digital signal
   processor as in prior software-based methods or the use of a tester. The
   technique uses digital logic that can be synthesized on-chip along with
   the analog/RF tuning circuitry to performing self-tuning. An optimized
   digital bitstream ( stimulus) is used to stimulate the RF device, and
   the response of the device is downconverted to the low-frequency domain
   using a sensor. The resulting signal is mapped to a digital signature,
   in such a way that the Hamming distance between the observed and the
   reference signatures represents the degree by which the device
   specifications differ from the nominal specifications. A logic-driven
   algorithm is used to minimize this Hamming distance to optimize multiple
   RF specifications concurrently. The presented methodology incurs minimal
   area overhead, and the tuning time is in the order of milliseconds.
   Results obtained by tuning the power amplifier of a 2.4-GHz transmitter
   show up to 16\% yield improvement. To validate the proposed yield
   improvement concept on hardware, results obtained from experimentation
   on an industrial transmitter are presented.}},

   batteries}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{238-246}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We report on a simple and fast route to prepare lithium selenide (Li2Se)
   nanoparticles and show a versatile solution-based method to form uniform
   nanostructured carbon (C)-Li2Se composites with and without additional
   carbon shell. We systematically compare electrochemical performance
   characteristics of 50-100 nm high purity Li2Se nanoparticles with that
   of the C-Li2Se nanocomposites for rechargeable Li battery applications.
   While Li2Se nanopowder show high initial capacity, it suffers from
   active material loss and shuttle of dissolved polyselenides, resulting
   in low cycling stability and resistance growth, additionally aggravated
   by mechanical cathode degradation induced by repetitive volume changes
   during cycling. By embedding Li2Se nanoparticles into a conductive
   carbon matrix, mechanical stability of electrodes was greatly enhanced.
   More importantly, the dissolution and shuttle of polyselenides was
   suppressed significantly even for smaller (-20 nm) and thus more
   reactive Li2Se nanoparticles. As a result, C-Li2Se nanocomposite
   cathodes showed high rate capability and promising cycling stability
   with carbon-shell protected C-Li2Se showing virtually no degradation in
   100 cycles. When compared with somewhat similar lithium sulfide (Li2S)
   nanoparticles and C-Li2S electrodes, we observe lower over potential at
   different C-rates in case of Li2Se and C-Li2Se materials, which is
   advantageous for battery applications. Based on the postmortem analysis,
   significant Li dendrite growth observed in Li2Se/Li cells did not take
   place in C-Li2Se/Li and C-Li2Se@C/Li cells, suggesting that polyselenide
   shuttle may affect Li plating morphology. Beyond the organic
   electrolyte-based Li-Se batteries, all-solid Li-Se batteries based on
   the produced C-Li2Se nanocomposite cathode were built for the first time
   using conventional Li2S-P255 solid state electrolyte. These solid state
   cells showed very promising cycling stability, a single flat plateau and
   very small voltage hysteresis in the range of 0.1-0.4 V when tested at
   60 and 80 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The open circuit voltage of a conventional H-2-O-2 fuel cell is limited
   to 1.23 V under atmospheric pressure, which limits the efficiency of the
   system. Here, we reported a dual-electrolyte microfluidic fuel cell
   system (DEFC), which could stably deliver an open circuit voltage up to
   1.76 V at room temperature under atmospheric pressure, and a peak power
   density of 145 mW/cm(2), improved by 3 times compared with that in
   single electrolyte mode. When operated in the reverse mode, the
   microfluidic cell can be used for water electrolysis, demonstrating a
   water split voltage of 0.74 V and a round trip voltage efficiency of
   83.5\% at a current density of 100 mA/cm(2). The neutralization energy
   of the two electrolytes, which could be wasted as heat, can be directly
   utilized to produce electricity or split water with high efficiency.
   Given the DEFC's features of high open-circuit voltage, low water
   splitting voltage, and room temperature operation condition, the
   reported DEFCs technology presents a superior route for high efficiency
   energy conversion and storage system that could revolutionize the fields
   of large-scale energy storage and portable power systems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Mimicry of biomineralization is an attractive strategy to fabricate
   nanostructured hybrid materials. While biomineralization involves
   processes that organize hybrid clusters into complex structures with
   hierarchy, arrangement of artificial components in biomimetic approaches
   has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate self-assembly of
   hierarchically structured porous supraparticles from protein inorganic
   hybrid flower-shaped (FS) nanoparticle building blocks. In our strategy,
   the FS nanoparticles self-assemble via high valency interactions in
   combination with interfacial adsorption and compression. The flower-like
   shape directed robust assembly of the FS nanoparticles into chain-like
   clusters in solution, which were further assembled into spherical
   supraparticles during rotation of FS nanoparticle solution. Continuously
   expanding and contracting the air water interface during rotation
   catalyzed assembly of FS nanoparticle dusters, indicating that
   adsorption and compression of the building blocks at the interface were
   critical. The resulting supraparticles contain hierarchical pores which
   are translated from the structural characteristics of individual FS
   nanoparticle building blocks. The protein inorganic supraparticles are
   protein compatible, have large surface area, and provide specific
   affinity recognition for robust protein immobilization. A variety of
   functional proteins could be immobilized to the porous supraparticles,
   making it a general platform that could provide benefits for many
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks will be responsible for a majority of the fast
   growth in intelligent systems in the next decade. However, most of the
   wireless smart sensor nodes require an external power source such as a
   Li-ion battery, where the labor cost and environmental waste issues of
   replacing batteries have largely limited the practical applications.
   Instead of using a Li-ion battery, we report an ultrastable, highly
   efficient, and super hydrophobic-surface-based triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) to scavenge wind energy for sustainably powering a
   wireless smart temperature sensor node. There is no decrease in the
   output voltage and current of the TENG, after continuous working for
   about 14 h at a wind speed of 12 m/s. Through a power management
   circuit, the TENG can deliver a constant output voltage of 3.3 V and a
   pulsed output current of about 100 mA to achieve highly efficient energy
   storage in a capacitor. A wireless smart temperature sensor node can be
   sustainably powered by the TENG for sending the real-time temperature
   data to an iPhone under a working distance of 26 m, demonstrating the
   feasibility of the self-powered wireless smart sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{Silk fibroin adsorption at the heterogeneous hydrophobic-hydrophilic
   surface of graphene oxide (GO) with different degrees of oxidation is
   addressed experimentally and theoretically. Samples are prepared using
   various spin-assisted deposition conditions relevant to assembly of
   laminated nanocomposites from graphene-based components, and compared
   with silicon dioxide (SiO2) as a benchmark substrate. Secondary
   structure of silk backbones changes as a function of silk fibroin
   concentration, substrate chemical composition, and deposition dynamics
   are assessed and compared with molecular dynamic simulations. It is
   observed that protofibrils form at low concentrations while variance in
   the deposition speed has little effect on silk secondary structure and
   morphology. However, balance of nonbonded interactions between
   electrostatic and van der Waals contributions can lead to silk secondary
   structure retention on the GO surface. Molecular dynamics simulations of
   silk fibroin at different surfaces show that strong van der Waals
   interactions play a pivotal role in losing and disrupting secondary
   structure on graphene and SiO2 surfaces. Fine tuning silk fibroin
   structure on heterogeneous graphene-based surfaces paves the way toward
   development of biomolecular reinforcement for biopolymer-graphene
   laminated nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{Monensin (MON) and salinomycin (SAL), known as polyether ionophore
   antibiotics (IPAs), are extensively used in livestock industry and can
   enter the environment via animal manure and agricultural runoff.
   Although some studies have investigated the environmental fate and
   transformation of IPAs, the lack of information on IPAs' aqueous-phase
   chemical properties is a major hindrance for further in-depth research.
   This study was able to experimentally determine the acidity constants
   (pKa), metal-complex dissociation constants (K-diss), and intrinsic
   aqueous solubility of MON species, and some of these properties of SAL.
   The pK(a) value of MON was found to be 4.5, close to other aliphatic
   carboxylic acids and the predicted value by the computer program
   ChemAxon. The metal-complex dissociation constants of MON were estimated
   to be 0.058 and 0.573 with sodium ion (Na+) and potassium ion (K+),
   respectively. The K-diss value of SAL with sodium ion was found to be
   1.31. Compared to the previous values determined in organic solvents,
   the K-diss of MON in aqueous phase are several orders of magnitude
   higher but maintain the same relative selectivity toward metal ions (Na+
   versus K+). The determined pKa and K-diss values were also used to
   assess the aqueous solubility limits of different IPA species under
   different pH and metal ion concentrations. Results from this study
   provide more accurate information for the properties of IPAs. The
   obtained constants can be applied to predict the speciation of IPAs in
   various aquatic systems and help shed light on the environmental fate of
   IPAs.}},

Title = {{Experiments for Obtaining Cohesive-Zone Parameters for Copper-Mold
   Compound Interfacial Delamination}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Interfacial delamination due to mismatch of coefficient of thermal
   expansion is a prominent failure mechanism of multilayer microelectronic
   packaging. Current methods for investigating and preventing interfacial
   delamination rely heavily on interfacial fracture mechanics. Such
   techniques are effective but also limited because they rely on
   assumptions about existing cracked geometry. Cohesive-zone modeling is
   an alternative technique for modeling interfacial delamination that is
   capable of simulating both crack initiation and crack propagation. This
   paper presents a methodology for developing a cohesive-zone model for an
   interface between the copper leadframe and the epoxy molding compound
   (EMC). Through experiments, the interfacial strength is characterized
   quantitatively, and load versus displacement data are collected for each
   experiment. By mimicking these results with a cohesive-zone model,
   mixed-mode cohesive-zone parameters are obtained. The fully defined
   mixed-mode cohesive-zone model can be used to simulate interfacial
   delamination between the copper leadframe and the EMC in any
   microelectronic package that contains such an interface. Furthermore,
   the procedure demonstrated here may be employed to characterize a
   cohesive-zone model for other interfaces in microelectronic packages.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by behaviors of schools of fish seeking darker (shaded) regions
   in environments, this paper proposes a distributed source seeking
   strategy for a mobile sensor network. The strategy allows each sensing
   agent to take instantaneous measurements of the field and collectively
   move against the direction of spatial gradient, without explicitly
   estimating the gradient. For each agent, one portion of its velocity is
   designed to be proportional to its measurement of the field, and another
   portion of its velocity is devoted to keep a formation with other
   agents. This strategy generates a speeding-up and slowing-down (SUSD)
   behavior that is very similar to what has been observed in schools of
   fish. Convergence analysis of this SUSD strategy shows that the moving
   direction of the agent formation will be aligned with the opposite
   gradient direction so that the formation moves toward a local minimum of
   the field, which is referred to as the source of the field. The SUSD
   strategy is also robust to deterministic disturbances and stochastic
   noise, which is rigorously justified by proving that the resulting
   closed-loop system is input-to-state stable and noise-to-state stable.
   Both simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate
   the SUSD strategy.}},

   developed based on the relationship among different orders of moments.
   Compared with the existing algorithms, the estimator, which exploits the

Abstract = {{Particle pH is a critical but poorly constrained quantity that affects
   many aerosol processes and properties, including aerosol composition,
   concentrations, and toxicity. We assess PM1 pH as a function of
   geographical location and altitude, focusing on the northeastern U.S.,
   based on aircraft measurements from the Wintertime Investigation of
   Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity campaign (1 February to 15 March
   2015). Particle pH and water were predicted with the ISORROPIA-II
   thermodynamic model and validated by comparing predicted to observed
   partitioning of inorganic nitrate between the gas and particle phases.
   Good agreement was found for relative humidity (RH) above 40\%; at lower
   RH observed particle nitrate was higher than predicted, possibly due to
   organic-inorganic phase separations or nitrate measurement uncertainties
   associated with low concentrations (nitrate<1 mu gm(-3)). Including
   refractory ions in the pH calculations did not improve model
   predictions, suggesting they were externally mixed with PM1 sulfate,
   nitrate, and ammonium. Sample line volatilization artifacts were found
   to be minimal. Overall, particle pH for altitudes up to 5000m ranged
   between -0.51 and 1.9 (10th and 90th percentiles) with a study mean of
   0.770.96, similar to those reported for the southeastern U.S. and
   eastern Mediterranean. This expansive aircraft data set is used to
   investigate causes in variability in pH and pH-dependent aerosol
   components, such as PM1 nitrate, over a wide range of temperatures (-21
   to 19 degrees C), RH (20 to 95\%), inorganic gas, and particle
   concentrations and also provides further evidence that particles with
   low pH are ubiquitous.}},

Abstract = {{Bluff bodies may assume arbitrary attitudes in a flow, causing
   aerodynamic loads that are sensitive to attitude. The Continuous
   rotation technique obtains 6-component loads on bluff bodies with
   1-degree azimuth resolution about selected axes at a rate of 1
   revolution per minute. The load coefficient variation is Fourier
   transformed and the resulting complex series is truncated in order to
   obtain rapidly computable, analytical formulae. The method is applied to
   bluff body shapes including cylinders, a cuboid, a flat plate and a
   porous box. A cylinder whose length is equal to its diameter, is used to
   show that rate effects, hysteresis, vortex shedding and other unsteady
   aerodynamic phenomena are negligible below 10 revolutions per minute.
   Approaches to generalize the aerodynamic loads on yawed finite cylinders
   of various aspect ratio are studied. The reasons for differences in
   aerodynamic load behavior between 2 cylinder models, are analyzed. To
   complement experiments, the ROTCFD unsteady Navier Stokes code is used
   to perform diagnostic computations. Methods to generalize the
   predictions are explored. Maps of the leading coefficients of the
   Fourier series of each load component over the aspect ratios space, are
   interpolated. The interpolation varies sharply for aspect ratios between
   0.5 to 1. The variation is more gradual beyond aspect ratio 2. By aspect
   ratio 4, a `high aspect ratio' limit appears to be reached.}},

Abstract = {{Knee-joint sounds could potentially be used to noninvasively probe the
   physical and/or physiological changes in the knee associated with
   rehabilitation following acute injury. In this paper, a system and
   methods for investigating the consistency of knee-joint sounds during
   complex motions in silent and loud background settings are presented.
   The wearable hardware component of the system consists of a
   microelectromechanical systems microphone and inertial rate sensors
   interfaced with a field programmable gate array-based real-time
   processor to capture knee-joint sound and angle information during three
   types of motion: flexion-extension (FE), sit-to-stand (SS), and walking
   (W) tasks. The data were post-processed to extract high-frequency and
   short-duration joint sounds (clicks) with particular waveform
   signatures. Such clicks were extracted in the presence of three
   different sources of interference: background, stepping, and rubbing
   noise. A histogram-vector (V) over right arrow (n) was generated from
   the clicks in a motion-cycle n, where the bin range was 10 degrees. The
   Euclidean distance between a vector and the arithmetic mean (V) over
   right arrow (av) of all vectors in a recording normalized by the (V)
   over right arrow (av) is used as a consistency metric d(n). Measurements
   from eight healthy subjects performing FE, SS, and W show that the mean
   (of mean) consistency metric for all subjects during SS (mu{[}mu(d(n))]=
   0.72 in silent, 0.85 in loud) is smaller compared with the FE
   (mu{[}mu(d(n))]= 1.02 in silent, 0.95 in loud) and W (mu{[}mu(d(n))]=
   0.94 in silent, 0.97 in loud) exercises, thereby implying more
   consistent click-generation during SS compared with the FE and W.
   Knee-joint sounds from one subject performing FE during five consecutive
   work-days (mu{[}mu(d(n)) = 0.72) and five different times of a day
   (mu{[}mu(d(n)) = 0.73) suggests high consistency of the clicks on
   different days and throughout a day. This work represents the first
   time, to the best of our knowledge, that joint sound consistency has
   been quantified in ambulatory subjects performing every-day activities
   (e.g., SS, walking). Moreover, it is demonstrated that noise inherent
   with joint-sound recordings during complex motions in uncontrolled
   settings does not prevent joint-sound-features from being detected
   successfully.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the massive parallel computing capability and outstanding image
   and signal processing performance, cellular neural network (CNN) is one
   promising type of non-Boolean computing system that can outperform the
   traditional digital logic computation and mitigate the physical scaling
   limit of the conventional CMOS technology. The CNN was originally
   implemented by VLSI analog technologies with operational amplifiers and
   operational transconductance amplifiers as neurons and synapses,
   respectively, which are power and area consuming. In this paper, we
   propose a hybrid structure to implement the CNN with magnetic components
   and CMOS peripherals with a complete driving and sensing circuitry. In
   addition, we propose a digitally programmable magnetic synapse that can
   achieve both positive and negative values of the templates. After
   rigorous performance analyses and comparisons, optimal energy is
   achieved based on various design parameters, including the driving
   voltage and the CMOS driving size. At a comparable footprint area and
   operation speed, a spintronic CNN is projected to achieve about one
   order of magnitude energy reduction per operation compared to its CMOS
   counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{Small cell deployment in heterogeneous networks, whereby small cell base
   stations (SBS) are deployed alongside traditional macro-cell base
   stations, is a proven solution for enhancing spatial frequency reuse
   across licensed spectrum in long-term evolution (LTE) networks. In order
   to mitigate the shortage of licensed spectrum resources,
   licensed-assisted access (LAA) has been introduced to allow LTE SBSs to
   share the unlicensed channel with WiFi nodes. As such, a complex yet
   interesting optimization problem results from the joint utilization of
   licensed and unlicensed spectrum resources by the SBSs to meet the
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of small cell users (SUEs). In
   this paper, we highlight the fundamental tradeoff induced by the SBSs
   between the amount of co-channel interference (CI) resulting from the
   reuse of licensed spectrum resources and the collision probability (CP)
   imposed on the coexisting WiFi nodes due to the sharing of unlicensed
   spectrum resources in such a coexisting LTE LAA-WiFi heterogeneous
   network deployment. We find that this fundamental tradeoff can be
   analyzed by developing a power allocation rule with double water-filling
   lines and the complete set of Pareto optimal solution can be achieved by
   the weighted Tchebycheff method. Our simulation results show that the
   proposed joint resource allocation algorithm can achieve a flexible and
   suitable tradeoff between the licensed spectrum CI and the WiFi CP
   according to the QoS requirements of SUEs in LTE LAA networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of tomographic area mapping using radio
   frequency measurements gathered by a network of mobile nodes. Termed
   radio tomographic imaging, the technique has shown potential for object
   tracking, imaging static obstacles, and even through-wall imaging. Our
   approach addresses substantial issues for the practical implementation
   of such a system, namely, the mitigation of multipath signal effects and
   the characterization of a large number of uncalibrated network links. We
   propose a system that utilizes ultrawideband direct path signal strength
   measurements as a means of reducing the effects of the multipath fading.
   Furthermore, we address the estimation of unknown path loss and link
   bias parameters online through the framework of a linear mixed effects
   model. This permits the estimation of a static area map without a
   prohibitive calibration of these parameters prior to deployment, which
   is crucial in a network that may contain hundreds of links. Our model is
   posed as a convex optimization problem using the elastic net for
   regularization. Bayesian performance bounds are derived and our method
   shows positive results in simulation. We then demonstrate the efficacy
   of our solution on real tomographic data gathered from our cognitive
   spectrum operations testbed.}},

Abstract = {{Curdlan is a commercial polysaccharide made by fermentation of
   Agrobacterium sp. Its anticipated expansion to larger volume markets
   demands improvement in its production efficiency. Metabolic engineering
   for strain improvement has so far been limited due to the lack of
   genetic tools. This research aimed to identify strong promoters and to
   engineer a strain that converts cellobiose efficiently to curdlan. Three
   strong promoters were identified and were used to install an
   energy-efficient cellobiose phosphorolysis mechanism in a
   curdlan-producing strain. The engineered strains were shown with
   enhanced ability to utilize cellobiose, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase
   in titer. The availability of metabolically engineered strain capable of
   producing beta-glucan from cellobiose paves the way for its production
   from cellulose. The identified native promoters from Agrobacterium open
   up opportunities for further metabolic engineering for improved
   production of curdlan and other products. The success shown here marks
   the first such metabolic engineering effort in this microbe.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulating drugs in nanoparticles (NPs) provide some advantages over
   free drugs; for example the probability of distribution in off-target
   tissues decreases and drugs remain safe from environment degrading
   factors. Upon entering the bioenvironment, NPs establish a number of
   interactions with their surroundings based on their physicochemical
   properties. Here we demonstrate how the size-surface charge interplay of
   chitosan NPs affects the protein corona formation and endocytosis
   pathway in the HeLa cells at non-toxic concentrations. Generally, large
   NPs (102 and 161 nm) with low surface charge (+6.7 and +3.6 mV)
   exhibited weaker tendency for endocytosis compared with smaller ones (63
   and 83 nm with 10 and 9.3 mV surface charge, respectively). This is
   mainly because the interactions of larger NPs with the plasma membrane
   were too weak to release enough free energy required for cellular
   internalization. Furthermore, we tested the upright and inverted cell
   culture configurations to better understand the impact of the
   sedimentation and diffusion velocities of NPs on the resulting cellular
   uptake pattern in both serum free and serum containing culture medias.
   Considering the different particokinetics, the amount of internalized
   NPs in upright and inverted positions differed in all cases by a factor
   of approximately three (for 161 nm particles), or less for smaller ones.
   Ultimately, our results offer a paradigm for analyzing the biobehavior
   of NPs under the precise control of their physicochemical
   characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As more advanced and diverse semiconductor products are demanded, each
   product requires more processing steps, and the product mix changes

   which requires the transfer of wafer lots from one line to another.
   Lifters are machines for inter-line transfers, and they can quickly
   become a critical bottleneck of semiconductor manufacturing. We
   introduce an online assignment problem between lifters and inter-line
   transfers, which is motivated in unified automated material handling
   systems. We propose several solution methods to improve assignment
   efficiency and resolve inter-line transfer delays in material handling
   systems. When compared to the round robin method used currently, the

Abstract = {{Curved mating surfaces that exist in complex engine parts such as
   turbine blades play a critical role in part fitting and assembly and,
   thus, system performance. Control of precise surface metrology (e.g.,
   form error, surface roughness) during machining of such surfaces is
   highly challenging, especially when processing super alloys like
   hardened steels. This work aims to experimentally investigate surface
   metrology of a 12.70-mm-thick curved plate platform (with S-shaped
   sidewall) of AISI SS304 material during milling on a vertical three-axis
   milling machine with three different tool path strategies: ramp,
   contour, and peripheral. Experiments are performed to study surface
   location error (SLE) and roughness during upward and downward feeding of
   tool on both concave and convex sidewall surfaces at different spindle
   speed and feed combinations. SLE values that are estimated as undercut
   or overcut with respect to the desired surface are found to be minimum
   with ramp (15.05 mu m), followed by contour (18.63 mu m), and maximum
   with peripheral (24.12 mu m) milling paths. However, peripheral milling
   may be preferable in terms of surface roughness (improved about 40 \%)
   and overall machining time (six times faster than ramp milling). The
   findings are analyzed based on the associated cutting mechanics and
   cutting forces.}},

Abstract = {{AimsThere is emerging evidence that point-of-use (POU) water treatment
   can be effective in the improvement of microbial water quality and the
   decrease in diarrhoeal disease incidence in humanitarian emergencies.
   Coagulant/disinfection products (CDPs) have the distinct advantage of
   providing microbial quality improvement, turbidity reductions and a free
   chlorine residual (FCR). The laboratory treatment performance of a novel
   CDP, the Pureit((R))' sachet, has been evaluated under different water
   quality conditions.
   Methods and ResultsThe CDP performance was evaluated with regard to
   bacteriological humanitarian water quality objectives as well as the
   recent World Health Organization recommendations for evaluating POU
   water treatment options. At least 4 log(10) reductions of tested
   bacterial indicators for a highly protective' status were attained in
   the tested conditions. Treated waters were consistently below 10MPN per
   100ml with regard to final Escherichia coli concentrations (i.e. low
   risk') with majority of samples with no detectable E.coli (i.e. very low
   risk'). Attainment of the target FCR levels (at least 0<bold></bold>5
   and 0<bold></bold>2mgl(-1) after 0<bold></bold>5 and 24h respectively)
   was dependant on the test water matrix. FCRs are thought to have been
   affected by the product's formulation, which contains a quenching agent
   intended to reduce chlorinous tastes. Treated water turbidity levels
   were marginally above the nonhealth-based target of five nephelometric
   turbidity units, partially due to the filtration cloth employed.
   ConclusionsThis study has served to identify the performance envelopes
   of the CDP under challenging conditions. In particular, initial alkaline
   pHs negatively affected this product's performance with regard to
   bacterial log(10) reductions.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis CDP has the potential to attain
   humanitarian drinking water quality objectives when not operating under
   extreme conditions; consistently achieving E.coli log(10) reductions
   between 4<bold></bold>5 and 5<bold></bold>2 resulting in treated water
   with E.coli concentrations mostly below the <1MPN per 100ml target
   level.}},

Title = {{Modeling of In-Tube Condensation of Zeotropic Mixtures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Studies in the literature have shown that zeotropic mixture condensation
   rates are lower than those predicted using a pure-fluid approach. This
   has been attributed to the decrease in fluid temperature that occurs
   with zeotropic mixtures and to the development of concentration
   gradients in the vapor-phase that limit the condensation heat transfer.
   The decrease in the apparent heat transfer coefficient is not consistent
   across mass fluxes, tube diameters, fluid combinations, saturation
   pressures, and concentrations. Several modeling techniques exist, which
   allow engineers to model the decrease in heat transfer rates. This study
   provides guidelines on when the mass transfer effects can be neglected
   and when it is appropriate to apply established models in the
   literature. A condensation database containing fluid combinations of
   pairs of hydrocarbons, ammonia and water, and synthetic refrigerants
   across large changes in operating conditions, tube diameters, and
   concentrations is used to validate the approach. The proposed framework
   predicts that the Bell and Ghaly (1973, ``An Approximate Generalized
   Design Method for Multicomponent/Partial Condensers,{''} AIChE Symp.
   Ser., 69, pp. 72-79) approach is valid for mid-and high-reduced
   pressures, i.e., above 0.40, while explicitly accounting for mass
   transfer is necessary at lower reduced pressures, i.e., below 0.40,
   where the influence of the temperature glide in the Bell and Ghaly
   method is weighted too strongly.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear impairments of OFDM signals in 5G multi-radio access
   technology (multi-RAT) heterogeneous mobile fronthaul (MFH) networks are
   investigated. Although nonlinear subcarrier intermodulations (IMs) of
   OFDM signals have been studied extensively, inter-band interferences
   among multiple OFDM services in multi-RAT heterogeneous systems have not
   been evaluated yet. In this paper, for the first time as we know,
   inter-band IMs among subcarriers of multiband OFDM services in a
   multi-RAT heterogeneous MFH network are investigated. A millimeter wave
   MFH testbed is used to evaluate the nonlinear interferences among
   multiple OFDM services from various radio access technologies (RATs).
   Both theoretical analysis and experiments are carried out, and it is
   verified that inter-band IMs among different OFDM services actually play
   a more important role in the MFH performance degradation than the
   well-known intra-band IMs of each individual service. Finally,
   nonlinearity compensation of MFH networks is demonstrated by
   predistortion technique, and effective mitigation of both intra-and
   inter-band subcarrier IMs are realized.}},

   in Millimeter-Wave Radio-Over-Fiber Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{4178-4185}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We proposed to use the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme in
   60-GHz-millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber systems, exploiting the power
   domain of signals to enable multiuser access, and improve the
   performance with users under different channel conditions. A DSP-based
   successive interference cancellation scheme is implemented in the
   receiver to remove the interference from other users. By this NOMA
   scheme, the system optimizes the performance of all users as a whole
   group and dynamically allocates the power resources between different
   users, such that the reception quality and reliability of the user group
   is significantly improved compared with current orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access. To overcome the user number and
   security issue raised from NOMA, both orthogonal and NOMA are applied. A
   nonlinear conjugate gradient method is proposed in the power allocation
   updating process for fast convergence of the feedback system. With a
   centralized radio-over-fiber architecture, we enable the millimeter wave
   system with high-resource utilization rate and better approximation to
   end users with low cost. A 4-Gb/s downlink system serving three users
   using 60-GHz band is experimentally demonstrated and measured. The
   proposed scheme provides larger distance coverage, wider angle
   tolerance, and better shaded channel tolerance. Better reception quality
   and reliability are experimentally verified without reducing data rate
   or increasing transmission power.}},

Abstract = {{The present work combines numerical and experimental efforts to
   investigate the effect of nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges on the
   low-temperature oxidation of C2H4/O-2/Ar mixtures under reduced pressure
   conditions. The nonequilibrium plasma discharge is modeled using a
   one-dimensional framework, employing separate electron and neutral gas
   temperatures, and using a detailed plasma and combustion chemical
   kinetic mechanism. Good agreement is seen between the numerical and
   experimental results, and both results show that plasma enables
   low-temperature C2H4 oxidation. Compared to zero-dimensional modeling,
   the one-dimensional modeling significantly improves predictions,
   probably because it produces a more complete physical description
   (including sheath formation and accurate reduced electric field).
   Furthermore, the one- and zero-dimensional models show very different
   reaction pathways, using the same chemical kinetic mechanism and thus
   suggest different interpretations of the experimental results. Two
   kinetic mechanisms (HP-Mech and USC Mech-II) are examined in this study.
   The modeling results from HP-Mech agree better with the experimental
   results than those of USC Mech-II because USC Mech-II does not include
   the OH+C2H4=CH2CH2OH reaction pathway. The model shows that 75-77\% of
   the input pulse energy is consumed during the breakdown process in
   electron impact dissociation, excitation, and ionization reactions,
   which efficiently produce reactive radical species, fuel fragments, and
   excited species. The modeling results using HP-Mech reveal that
   reactions between O(D-1) and C2H4 generate 24\% of OH, 19\% of HCO, 60\%
   of CH3, 63\% of CH2, and 17\% of CH2O. These in turn significantly
   enhance hydrocarbon oxidation, since 83\% of CO comes from HCO and 53\%
   of CO2 comes from CH2 under the present low-temperature environment and
   short time scale.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemically induced mechanical degradation hinders the application
   of Si anodes in advanced lithium-ion batteries. Hollow structures and
   surface coatings have been often used to mitigate the degradation, of
   Si-based anodes. However, the structural change and degradation
   mechanism during lithiation/delithiation of hollow Si structures with
   coatings remain unclear. Here, we combine in situ TEM experiment and
   chemomechanical modeling tri-study the electrochemically induced
   swelling of amorphous-Si (a-Si) nanotubes with different thicknesses of
   surface SiOx layers. Surprisingly; we find that no inward expansion
   occurs at the inner surface during lithiation of a-Si nanotubes with
   native oxides. In contrast, inward expansion can be induced by
   increasing the thickness of SiOx on the outer surface, thus reducing the
   overall outward swelling of the lithiated nanotube. Moreover, both the
   sandwich lithiation mechanism and the two-stage lithiation process in a
   Si nanotubes remain unchanged with the-increasing thickness of surface
   coatings. Our chemomechanical Modeling reveals, the mechanical
   confinement effects in lithiated a-Si nanotubes with and without SiOx
   coatings: This work-not only provides insights into the degradation of
   nanotube anodes with surface coatings but also sheds light onto the
   optimal design of hollow anodes for high-performance lithium-ion

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanomaterials (CNs) are a new class of cellulose particles
   with properties and functionalities distinct from molecular cellulose
   and wood pulp, and as a result, they are being developed for
   applications that were once thought impossible for cellulosic materials.
   Momentum is growing in CN research and development, and
   commercialization in this field is happening because of the unique
   combination of characteristics (e.g., high mechanical properties,
   sustainability, and large-scale production potential) and utility across
   a broad spectrum of material applications (e.g. as an additive,
   self-sustaining structures, and template structures) that CNs offer.
   Despite the challenges typical for materials development, CN and near-CN
   production is ramping up with pilot scale to industry demonstration
   trials, and the first commercial products are starting to hit the
   marketplace. This review provides a broad overview of CNs and their
   capabilities that are enabling new application areas for cellulose-based
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Ageing inevitably leads to capacity degradation in a chiller plant.
   Hence in the life-cycle performance analysis of a chiller plant, ageing
   always represents a crucial consideration for designers. Ageing is
   normally quantified using maintenance factor. A conventional analysis
   recommends that the maintenance factor should be 0.01 for systems that
   undergo annual professional maintenance, and 0.02 for those that are
   seldom maintained. However, this recommendation is mainly based on a
   rule of thumb, and may not be accurate enough to describe the ageing for
   a given chiller plant. This research therefore proposes a method of
   identifying the chiller maintenance factor using a Bayesian Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo method, which can take account of the uncertainties that
   exist in the estimation of the ageing. Details of the identification
   will be provided by applying the proposed method to a real chiller
   plant, and results will be compared with that of the conventional
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Weapon-target assignment is a combinatorial optimization problem in
   which a set of weapons must selectively engage a set of targets. In its
   decentralized form, it is also an important problem in autonomous
   multi-agent robotics. In this work, decentralized methods are explored
   for a modified weapon-target assignment problem in which weapons seek to
   achieve a prespecified probability of kill on each target. Three novel
   cost functions are proposed that, in cases with low agent-to-target
   ratios, induce behaviors that may be preferable to the behaviors induced
   by classical cost functions. The performance of these proposed cost
   functions is explored in simulation of both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous engagement scenarios using airborne autonomous weapons.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cost functions achieve
   desired behaviors in cases with low agent-to-target ratios where
   efficient use of weapons is particularly important.}},

Abstract = {{An anomaly hypothesis testing technique using the minimum-fuel control
   distance metric is extended to incorporate non-Gaussian
   boundary-condition uncertainties and employ binary hypothesis testing.
   The adjusted control distance metric uses Gaussian-mixture models to
   model non-Gaussian boundary conditions, and binary hypothesis testing
   allows inclusion of anomaly detection thresholds and allowable error
   rates. An analogous framework accommodating Gaussian-mixture models and
   binary hypothesis testing is developed using Mahalanobis distance. Both
   algorithms are compared using simulated and empirical satellite maneuver
   data. The north-south station-keeping scenario shows control distance to
   be less sensitive with increased uncertainty than Mahalanobis distance
   but more consistent with respect to observation gap duration, a trend
   which is corroborated using available real-world data. The same
   consistency with respect to observation gap is observed in East-west
   station-keeping while also showing the control distance metric to be
   more sensitive for shorter observation gaps. In the non-Gaussian
   boundary-condition case, control distance outperforms Mahalanobis
   distance in both detection and computational complexity. A synergistic
   operational application of these methods is presented.}},

Title = {{Integrated Framework of Modified Accident Energy Release Model and

   Construction Collapse}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The Hangzhou subway construction collapse (HZSCC) is a serious accident
   that caused the most casualties in China's subway construction history.
   This disaster took place on November 15, 2008, causing 21 fatalities and
   24 injuries. Past analyses of the HZSCC were incomplete, and using
   traditional linear causation models made it difficult to grasp the
   nature of the HZSCC within its complex context of subway construction.
   This study aims to capture the full complexity of the HZSCC, on the
   basis of an integrated framework of a modified accident energy release
   model (MAERM) and network theory. Given that the energy release model
   has the advantage of revealing the nature of accident occurrence from an
   ontological perspective, it was adopted and was modified by employing
   the hierarchy of the causal influences model. The HZSCC causation
   analysis was conducted by identifying energy sources and analyzing
   invalidation of energy restraints. This accident is not isolated but
   rather a combination of 11 subaccidents. The multiple relationships
   among these subaccidents constitute an accident network within the
   process of the HZSCC. Commercially available software was employed to
   build the accident network and calculate corresponding topological
   parameters of average degree, average path length, diameter, clustering
   coefficient, and betweenness centrality. The concise and precise
   calculation of the topological parameters can benefit subaccidents
   propagation analysis in a broad sense and comprehension of the dynamic
   features of the HZSCC. The proposed framework has the potential for
   accident prediction, as the original accident can be regarded as a
   precursor event that could predict and prevent secondary and derivative
   accidents in an accident network.}},

Abstract = {{Routine mechanical characterization of asphalt concrete is performed
   under small-strain levels with on-specimen linear variable displacement
   transducers (LVDTs) as deformation measuring devices. An optical LVDT
   was conceptually proposed and evaluated in this study to serve as a
   viable noncontact alternative to physical LVDTs. The envisioned device
   consists of a pair of low-end low-resolution grayscale cameras, each
   monitoring a virtual gauge point, i.e.,a small untreated surface area of
   the tested specimen. The gauge length is the distance between the two
   virtual gauge points, and the sought-after information is their
   differential in-plane translation. Digital image correlation techniques
   were employed for the measurement, operated on the natural material
   texture without requiring speckle coating. As a first step toward
   evaluating the concept, the study explored both the precision and the
   accuracy that may be achieved with one low-resolution image sensor. A
   calibration scheme was also offered for introducing object-scale
   dimensions into the analysis. From this predevelopment study it is
   concluded that the envisioned optical LVDT is viable, rendering the idea
   worthy of consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Because scour has contributed to the collapse of a large number of
   bridges, many researchers have tried to find a general method of
   predicting scour to prevent the failure of bridge foundations. However,
   existing scour depth equations recommended by the Federal Highway
   Administration (FHWA) in the United States generally give excessively
   conservative estimates of the scour depth. One reason is that these
   equations are based primarily on idealized and simplified laboratory
   experiments in rectangular flumes. In addition to idealized and
   simplified laboratory experiments, another possible reason for scour
   depth overprediction is the current practice of adding separate
   estimates of contraction scour and local scour when in fact these
   processes occur simultaneously and interact. This study focuses
   specifically on the hydraulic modeling of local pier scour and
   contraction scour. Scaled field site was constructed in the Hydraulics
   Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology based on their Froude
   number similarity. We used several flow rates, including the 50- and
   100-year peak flood discharge and the 1998 historical flood discharge
   from field measurements provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
   and used them to compare scour measurements (contraction scour and local
   scour) in the laboratory and in the field. Based on the findings, a
   procedure for hydraulic modeling with scaled field geometry is
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for generation of nanoliter-volume, two-phase (compound)
   droplets with the ability to vary composition (i.e., encapsulant
   thickness) is presented. Thermocapillary-driven levitation of water
   droplets, a capability with potential for the improvement of
   lab-on-a-chip (LOC) processes, requires encapsulation by a secondary,
   less-volatile fluid that will also avoid the adverse effects of
   water-surface contamination on the driving surface motion. Key
   components of the closed system include the droplet generator actuated
   by a piezoelectric diaphragm, a pressure- control device, and a
   specialized nozzle for delivery of the encapsulating liquid.
   Experimental investigations demonstrate how system pressure variations
   allow composition changes, and voltage waveform input parameters
   regulate ejection dynamics, necessary for droplet capturing during the
   levitation process.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease that preferentially occurs
   in arterial regions exposed to d-flow can be used to indicate disturbed
   flow or disturbed blood flow. The mechanisms by which d-flow induces
   atherosclerosis involve changes in the transcriptome, methylome,
   proteome, and metabolome of multiple vascular cells, especially
   endothelial cells. Initially, we begin with the pathogenesis of
   atherosclerosis and the changes that occur at multiple levels owing to
   d-flow, especially in the endothelium. Also, there are a variety of
   strategies used for the global profiling of the genome, transcriptome,
   miRNA-ome, DNA methylome, and metabolome that are important to define
   the biological and pathophysiological mechanisms of endothelial
   dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Finally, systems biology can be used to
   integrate these omics' datasets, especially those that derive data based
   on a single animal model, in order to better understand the
   pathophysiology of atherosclerosis development in a holistic manner and
   how this integrative approach could be used to identify novel molecular
   diagnostics and therapeutic targets to prevent or treat atherosclerosis.

Abstract = {{A series of alumina-supported Fe-based catalysts is prepared via a dry
   impregnation method in the presence of a phosphorus source (phosphate
   salt) and then used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
   Specifically, supported catalysts with Fe:P molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1,
   and 3:1 are prepared and their chemical composition, textural
   properties, and redox properties are characterized with an array of
   techniques. In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation (PDH) of propane at 600
   degrees C and atmospheric pressure, the most active catalyst (Fe:P ratio
   of 3:1) exhibits 15\% propane conversion and >80\% C3H6 selectivity. The
   calculated activity is 9.9 mmol/(h g(Fe)) (mass basis) or 13 mu mol/(h
   m(2)) (surface area basis), with a corresponding TOF of 19 h(-1). During
   the initial stages of reaction under PDH conditions, the precatalyst is
   reduced and Fe(0) species are generated, eventually giving way to iron
   carbide species. During this induction period, significant carbon is
   incorporated into the catalyst and propylene selectivity is low. Only
   after the iron carbide phase appears do the reactivity and selectivity
   achieve steady-state conditions with high propylene selectivity and good
   activity. The addition of the phosphorus source in the precatalyst is
   found to be important in obtaining a catalyst with superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{The Pechini synthesis was used to prepare nickel aluminate catalysts
   with the compositions NiAl4O7, NiAl2O4, and Ni2Al2O5. The samples have
   been characterized by N-2 physisorption, temperature programmed
   reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XFS), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
   Characterization results indicate unique structural properties and
   excellent regeneration potential of nickel aluminates. Prepared samples
   were tested when unreduced and reduced prior to reaction for methane dry
   reforming and methane steam reforming reactivity. NiAl2O4 in the reduced
   and unreduced state as well as NiAl4O7 in the reduced state are active
   and stable for methane dry reforming due to the presence of 4-fold
   coordinated oxidized nickel. The limited amount of metallic nickel in
   these samples minimizes carbon deposition. On the other hand, the
   presence of metallic nickel is required for methane steam reforming.
   Ni2Al2O5 in the reduced and unreduced states and NiAl2O4 in the reduced
   state are found to be active for methane steam reforming due to the
   presence of sufficiently small nickel nanoparticles that catalyze the
   reaction without accumulating carbonaceous deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Converting lignocellulosics to simple sugars for second generation
   bioethanol is complicated due to biomass recalcitrance, and it requires
   a pretreatment stage prior to enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study,
   native, pretreated (acid and alkaline) and partially hydrolyzed poplar
   and switchgrass were characterized by using Simons' staining for
   cellulose accessibility, GPC for degree of polymerization (DP), and FTIR
   for chemical structure of plant cell wall. The susceptibility of the
   pretreated biomass to enzymatic hydrolysis could not be easily predicted
   from differences in cellulose DP and accessibility. During hydrolysis,
   the most significant DP reduction occurred at the very beginning of
   hydrolysis, and the DP began to decrease at a significantly slower rate
   after this initial period, suggesting an existence of a synergistic
   action of endo- and exoglucanases that contribute to the occurrence of a
   ``peeling off{''} mechanism. Cellulose accessibility was found to be
   increased at the beginning of hydrolysis, after reaching a maximum value
   then started to decrease. The fresh enzyme restart hydrolysis experiment
   along with the accessibility data indicated that the factors associated
   with the nature of enzyme such as irreversible nonspecific binding of
   cellulases by lignin and steric hindrance of enzymes should be
   responsible for the gradual slowing down of the reaction rate.}},

Abstract = {{The present work combines quantitative orientation imaging microscopy
   and in situ digital image correlation to identify heterogeneities in the
   coupled mechanics and microstructure evolution occurring in the deformed
   subsurface during transient shear-based surface generation. Subsurface
   microstructure exhibited heterogeneities in terms of thickness of the
   ultrafine-grained layer and recrystallization fraction as a function of
   position along the surface wavelength. It was observed that subsurface
   microstructure evolution followed accelerated recrystallization kinetics
   due to strain path changes occurring in the subsurface during transient
   surface generation. The magnitudes of these strain path changes and
   pre-straining of the deformed subsurface were observed to correlate well
   with changeS in the information entropy of the corresponding subsurface
   crystallographic textures. A phenomenological model for predicting the
   information entropy of the orientation distribution function based on
   strain path changes and strain history was formulated and validated for
   monotonic loading paths. The implications of this generalized framework
   for modeling and controlling subsurface microstructure in transient
   surface generation are briefly discussed. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Significance: Currently, calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is only
   treatable through surgical intervention because the specific mechanisms
   leading to the disease remain unclear. In this review, we explore the
   forces and structure of the valve, as well as the mechanosensors and
   downstream signaling in the valve endothelium known to contribute to
   inflammation and valve dysfunction. Recent Advances: While the valvular
   structure enables adaptation to dynamic hemodynamic forces, these are
   impaired during CAVD, resulting in pathological systemic changes.
   Mechanosensing mechanisms-proteins, sugars, and membrane structures-at
   the surface of the valve endothelial cell relay mechanical signals to
   the nucleus. As a result, a large number of mechanosensitive genes are
   transcribed to alter cellular phenotype and, ultimately, induce
   inflammation and CAVD. Transforming growth factor-beta signaling and
   Wnt/beta-catenin have been widely studied in this context. Importantly,
   NADPH oxidase and reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species
   signaling has increasingly been recognized to play a key role in the
   cellular response to mechanical stimuli. In addition, a number of
   valvular microRNAs are mechanosensitive and may regulate the progression
   of CAVD. Critical Issues: While numerous pathways have been described in
   the pathology of CAVD, no treatment options are available to avoid
   surgery for advanced stenosis and calcification of the aortic valve.
   More work must be focused on this issue to lead to successful therapies
   for the disease. Future Directions: Ultimately, a more complete
   understanding of the mechanisms within the aortic valve endothelium will
   lead us to future therapies important for treatment of CAVD without the
   risks involved with valve replacement or repair.}},

Abstract = {{A unit cell model is developed to capture the elasto-visco-plastic
   response of a long fibre composite using a 3-dimensional finite element
   model. Using a glass rubber model, the elasto-visco-plastic response of
   the matrix is analysed and the fibre is considered to deform
   elastically. A functionally graded interphase zone is defined in the
   region surrounding and encompassing a reinforcing fibre. The model
   subdivides the interphase zone into an infinite number of concentric
   rings where stress and strain compatibility is preserved. This model
   aims to improve on the computational efficiency of micromechanics models
   where the fibre and matrix are modeled as separate materials. The
   mechanics of the fibre deformation are governed by a transformation
   tensor for transversely isotropic materials based on Eshelby's method.
   The model is calibrated using experimental data for the transverse
   compression of a unidirectional composite: it is then validated using
   axial compression and shear data for quasi static strain rates. For
   moderate strain rate the model is also calibrated for one of the
   transverse strain rates then validated using the other strain rates and
   axial compression. The proposed unit cell model is capable of predicting
   the elasto-visco-plastic response of long fibre composites to a very
   high accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A facile one-step method is developed for the direct growth of Ni3S2
   nanoplates on a conductive nickel foam, which interwove together to form
   nest-like highly porous microstructure. When used as a binder-and
   conductive-agent-free electrode, the Ni3S2/Ni electrode demonstrates
   remarkable electrochemical performance with a superior cycling stability
   and a high rate capability, proving its potential applicability as a
   high performance anode for lithium ion batteries. The excellent
   electrochemical properties can be attributed to the 3-dimesional (3-D)
   structure of the Ni foam uniformly covered with a porous layer of Ni3S2
   nanoplates. This structure provides excellent electrical contact between
   the active material and the current collector, a large electroactive
   surface area as well as well-sustained electrode integrity. The Ni3S2/Ni
   electrode maintains a reversible capacity of 623 mAh g(-1) after 150
   cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g (-1), and delivers a high
   reversible capacity of 377 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1.5 A
   g(-1). The observed surplus capacity is found to originate from an
   interface storage process via a pseudocapacity-like storage mechanism.

Abstract = {{Objective: Airway resistance is the mechanical cause of most of the
   symptoms in obstructive pulmonary disease, and can be considered as the
   primary measure of disease severity. A low-cost and noninvasive method
   to measure the airway resistance that does not require patient effort
   could be of great benefit in evaluating the severity of lung diseases,
   especially in patient population that are unable to use spirometry, such
   as young children. Methods: The Vision-Based Passive Airway Resistance
   Estimation (VB-PARE) technology is a passive method to measure airway
   resistance noninvasively. The airway resistance is estimated from: 1)
   airflow extracted from processing depth data captured by a Microsoft
   Kinect, and 2) Pulsus Paradoxus extracted from a pulse oximeter
   (SpO(2)). Results: To verify the validity and accuracy of the VB-PARE,
   two phases of experiment were conducted. In Phase I, spontaneous
   breathing data was collected from 14 healthy participants with
   externally induced airway obstruction, and the accuracy of 76.2 +/-
   13.8\% was achieved in predicting three levels of obstruction severity.
   In Phase II, VB-PARE outputs were compared with the clinical results
   from 14 patients. VB-PARE estimated the tidal volume with an average
   error of 0.07 +/- 0.06 liter. Also, patients with airway obstruction
   were detected with 80\% accuracy. Conclusion: Using the information
   extracted from Kinect and SpO(2), here, we present a quantitative method
   to measure the severity of airway obstruction without requiring active
   patient involvement. Significance: The proposed VB-PARE system
   contributes to the state-of-art respiration monitoring methods by
   expanding the idea of passive and noninvasive airway resistance
   measurement.}},

Abstract = {{In order to ensure the reliable operation of the electric power grid,
   infrastructure with increasing levels of distributed generation
   deployment, various entities and subsystems (e.g., ISOs, distribution
   utilities, micro-grids) needs a higher level coordination. Such
   coordination requires a formal decentralized control and management
   architecture that creates mechanisms for the operation and planning of
   numerous entities. A key function in power system operations and
   planning is the determination of total transfer capability (TTC), or the
   maximum amount of power that can be transferred from a set of source
   points to a set of sink points. This paper develops an algorithm for the
   decentralized computation of TTC through the application of the domain
   decomposition method (DDM). DDM decouples the correlation among
   interconnected control areas by taking advantage of the Schur complement
   matrix to form the power transfer distribution factor matrix. The
   decentralized TTC evaluation requires sparse information exchange among
   control areas. It is efficient and fully parallelizable. We demonstrate
   the decentralized TTC evaluation method on the IEEE 118-bus test case.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid advances in sensing and computing technology, multiple
   sensors have been widely used to simultaneously monitor the health
   status of an operation unit. This creates a data-rich environment,
   enabling an unprecedented opportunity to make better understanding and
   inference about the current and future behavior of the unit in real
   time. Depending on specific task requirements, a unit is often required
   to run under multiple operational conditions, each of which may affect
   the degradation path of the unit differently. Thus, two fundamental
   challenges remain to be solved for effective degradation modeling and
   prognostic analysis: 1) how to leverage the dependent information among
   multiple sensor signals to better understand the health condition of the
   unit; and 2) how to model the effects of multiple conditions on the
   degradation characteristics of the unit. To address these two issues,
   this paper develops a data fusion methodology that integrates the
   information from multiple sensors to construct a health index when the
   monitored unit runs under multiple operational conditions. Our goal is
   that the developed health index provides a much better characterization
   of the health condition of the degraded unit, and, thus, leads to a
   better prediction of the remaining lifetime. Unlike other existing
   approaches, the developed data fusion model combines the fusion
   procedure and the degradation modeling under different operational
   conditions in a unified manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method
   is demonstrated in a case study, which involves a degradation dataset of
   aircraft gas turbine engines collected from 21 sensors under six
   different operational conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents SPSTS, an automated sequential procedure for
   computing point and Confidence-Interval (CI) estimators for the
   steady-state mean of a simulation-generated process subject to
   user-specified requirements for the CI coverage probability and relative
   half-length. SPSTS is the first sequential method based on Standardized
   Time Series (STS) area estimators of the steady-state variance parameter
   (i.e., the sum of covariances at all lags). Whereas its leading
   competitors rely on the method of batch means to remove bias due to the
   initial transient, estimate the variance parameter, and compute the CI,
   SPSTS relies on the signed areas corresponding to two orthonormal STS
   area variance estimators for these tasks. In successive stages of SPSTS,
   standard tests for normality and independence are applied to the signed
   areas to determine (i) the length of the warm-up period, and (ii) a
   batch size sufficient to ensure adequate convergence of the associated
   STS area variance estimators to their limiting chi-squared
   distributions. SPSTS's performance is compared experimentally with that
   of recent batch-means methods using selected test problems of varying
   degrees of difficulty. SPSTS performed comparatively well in terms of
   its average required sample size as well as the coverage and average
   half-length of the final CIs.}},

Abstract = {{With their high strain rate hardening capacity and good combination of
   strength and ductility, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels
   offer lightweight solutions for reinforcement components undergoing
   crash events. The TRIP effect correlates with stress-stimulated
   martensitic transformation from austenite, which depends on a myriad of
   kinematic ingredients, including three-dimensional plastic deformation,
   temperature change, strain-rate, and stress state. The complex
   interdependency of these kinematic ingredients requires stepwise and
   time iterative numerical analyses, especially when boundary-value
   problems are imposed. Typically engineering desired boundary value
   problems involve simulations designed to control energy absorption under
   complex crash scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate a new
   phenomenological framework for thermomechanical modeling of multi-phase
   TRIP steel that captures the evolution of phase transformation. The
   model was implemented into the user-defined subroutine of the explicit
   dynamic version of the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA.
   Simulations were performed on a top-hat crush tube made of an industrial
   multiphase TRIP 800 steel. The results were utilized within an
   optimization simulation framework to pinpoint composition windows, which
   maximize the energy absorption capacity. When not concerned about peak
   crush force, larger compositions of austenite (typically 70\%) will
   outperform all other compositions. However, lowering the austenite
   volume fraction with higher volume fractions of bainite (similar to
   80\%) with balanced ferrite could produce a top-hat crush rail with a
   superior crush force and efficiency compared to TRIP 800 steel without
   increasing the peak crush force. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Using Finite-Element Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},

Abstract = {{Covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers can rearrange their
   macromolecular network by bond exchange reactions (BERs), where an
   active unit attaches to and then replaces a unit in an existing bond and
   forms a new bond. When such macromolecular events occur on the
   interface, they can contribute to surface welding, self-healing, and
   recycling of thermosetting polymers. In this paper, we study the
   interfacial welding and failure of CANs involving both interfacial
   normal and shear stresses. To do this, we incorporate our recently
   developed multiscale model for surface welding of CANs with a cohesive
   zone modeling approach in finite-element method (FEM) simulation. The
   developed FEM paradigm involves a multiscale model predicting the
   interfacial chain density and fracture energy, which are transferred to
   a cohesive zone model to establish the surface traction-separation law.
   The simulations show good agreement with experimental results on the
   modulus and strength of welded samples. They also provide understanding
   of the interactions between surface welding and material malleability in
   determining the final mechanical properties of polymer structures. The
   developed FEM model can be applied to study other complex welding
   problems, such as polymer reprocessing with nonregular particle size and
   shape.}},

Title = {{Geometric Nonlinearity Effects in the Response of Sandwich Wide Panels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the literature, there are various simplifying assumptions adopted in
   the kinematic relations of the faces and the core when considering a
   geometrically nonlinear problem in sandwich structures. Most commonly,
   only one nonlinear term is included in the faces and the core
   nonlinearities are neglected. A critical assessment of these
   assumptions, as well as the effects of including the other nonlinear
   terms in the faces and the core, is the scope of this paper. The
   comprehensive investigation of all the nonlinear terms is accomplished
   by deriving and employing an advanced nonlinear high-order theory,
   namely, the recently developed ``extended high-order sandwich panel
   theory{''} (EHSAPT). This theory, which was derived as a linear theory,
   is first formulated in this paper in its full nonlinear version for the
   simpler one-dimensional case of sandwich wide panels/beams. Large
   displacements and moderate rotations are taken into account in both
   faces and core. In addition, a nonlinear EHSAPT-based finite element
   (FE) is developed. A series of simplified models with various nonlinear
   terms included are derived accordingly to check the validity of each of
   these assumptions. Two sandwich panel configurations, one with a
   ``soft{''} and one with a ``hard{''} core, loaded in three-point
   bending, are analyzed. The geometric nonlinearity effects and the
   relative merits of the corresponding simplifications are analyzed with
   these two numerical examples. In addition to a relative comparison among
   all these different assumptions, the results are also compared to the
   corresponding ones from a commercial FE code.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Generally, porous jump (PJ) model is used for rapid air flow simulations
   (without resolving the tile pore structure) through perforated floor
   tiles in data centers. The PJ model only specifies a step pressure loss
   across the tile surface, without any influence on the flow field.
   However, in reality, the downstream flow field is affected because of
   the momentum rise of air due to acceleration through the pores, and
   interaction of jets emerging from the pores. The momentum rise could be
   captured by either directly resolving the tile pore structure
   (geometrical resolution (GR) model) or simulated by specifying a
   momentum source above the tile surface (modified body force (MBF)
   model). Note that specification of momentum source obviates the need of
   resolving the tile pore geometry and, hence, requires considerably low
   computational effort. In previous investigations, the momentum source
   was imposed in a region above the tile surface whose width and length
   were same as the tile dimensions with a preselected height. This model
   showed improved prediction with the experimental data, as well as with
   the model resolving the tile pore geometry. In the present
   investigation, we present an analysis for obtaining the momentum source
   region dimensions and other associated input variables so that the MBF
   model can be applied for general cases. The results from this MBF model
   were compared with the GR model and good agreement was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Low cost sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable
   attentions for large scale electric energy storage (EES), owing to the
   nature abundance of sodium sources in the earth crust. Searching for
   appropriate anode materials is a hot topic and vital for developing high

   attracted many interests, as their sandwiched framework stacked up
   together by van der Waals force can facilitate the electrons
   transportation and reversible Na+ ions intercalation. Here, NbS2
   nanosheets with two-dimensional (2D) layered structure have been
   fabricated by a facile chemical exfoliation method and been utilized as
   the anode material for SIBs. The chemically exfoliated NbS2 (ce-NbS2)
   nanosheets deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 205 mAh g(-1)
   at 100 mA g(-1), exhibit high rate performance and excellent cycling
   stability. In situ X-ray diffraction test demonstrates that ce-NbS2
   nanosheets will not suffer any unwanted phase transformation upon
   soidation/desodiation, which make them promising to construct high

Title = {{Interfacial welding of dynamic covalent network polymers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{1-17}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic covalent network (or covalent adaptable network) polymers can
   rearrange their macromolecular chain network by bond exchange reactions
   (BERs) where an active unit replaces a unit in an existing bond to form
   a new bond. Such macromolecular events, when they occur in large
   amounts, can attribute to unusual properties that are not seen in
   conventional covalent network polymers, such as shape reforming and
   surface welding; the latter further enables the important attributes of
   material malleability and powder based reprocessing. In this paper, a
   multiscale modeling framework is developed to study the surface welding
   of thermally induced dynamic covalent network polymers. At the
   macromolecular network level, a lattice model is developed to describe
   the chain density evolution across the interface and its connection to
   bulk stress relaxation due to BERs. The chain density evolution rule is
   then fed into a continuum level interfacial model that takes into
   account surface roughness and applied pressure to predict the effective
   elastic modulus and interfacial fracture energy of welded polymers. The
   model yields particularly accessible results where the moduli and
   interfacial strength of the welded samples as a function of temperature
   and pressure can be predicted with four parameters, three of which can
   be measured directly. The model identifies the dependency of surface

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical works predict the ability of surface phonon
   polaritons to increase thermal conduction along nanoparticle chains, but
   measurement of this effect has proven elusive. Here we demonstrate a new
   approach to observe thermal conduction by surface phonon polaritons -
   packed beds of SiO2 nanoparticles. When we modify the interstitial
   material with adsorbed water or a coating of ethylene glycol, we
   experimentally resolve thermal conductivities as high as 1.5 and 18
   times the phonon value, respectively. Although existing models do not
   fully explain our results, we develop a new scaling relation that
   suggests thermal conduction is primarily dependent on the 3D density of
   states. An examination of classical heat transport mechanisms shows that
   these are unlikely sources for the observed thermal conductivities,
   suggesting that surface phonon polaritons play an observable role in
   SiO2 nanoparticle bed heat transfer properties.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The development of effective therapies for cartilage
   protection has been limited by a lack of efficient quantitative
   cartilage imaging modalities in pre-clinical in vivo models. Our
   objectives were twofold: first, to validate a new contrast-enhanced 3D
   imaging analysis technique, equilibrium partitioning of an ionic
   contrast agent-micro computed tomography (EPIC-mu CT), in a rat medial
   meniscal transection (MMT) osteoarthritis (OA) model; and second, to
   quantitatively assess the sensitivity of EPIC-mu CT to detect the
   effects of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi) therapy on
   cartilage degeneration.
   Methods: Rats underwent MMT surgery and tissues were harvested at 1, 2,
   and 3 weeks post-surgery or rats received an MMPi or vehicle treatment
   and tissues harvested 3 weeks post-surgery. Parameters of disease
   progression were evaluated using histopathology and EPIC-mu CT.
   Correlations and power analyses were performed to compare the
   techniques.
   Results: EPIC-mu CT was shown to provide simultaneous 3D quantification
   of multiple parameters, including cartilage degeneration and osteophyte
   formation. In MMT animals treated with MMPi, OA progression was
   attenuated, as measured by 3D parameters such as lesion volume and
   osteophyte size. A post-hoc power analysis showed that 3D parameters for
   EPIC-mu CT were more sensitive than 2D parameters requiring fewer
   animals to detect a therapeutic effect of MMPi. 2D parameters were
   comparable between EPIC-mu CT and histopathology.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that EPIC-mu CT has high sensitivity
   to provide 3D structural and compositional measurements of cartilage and
   bone in the joint. EPIC-mu CT can be used in combination with histology
   to provide a comprehensive analysis to screen new potential therapies.

Abstract = {{Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG) is a promising
   alternative continuous fetal monitoring method that has the potential to
   allow morphological analysis of the FECG. However, there are a number of
   challenges associated with the evaluation of morphological parameters
   from the NI-FECG, including low signal to noise ratio of the NI-FECG and
   methodological challenges for getting reference annotations and
   evaluating the accuracy of segmentation algorithms. This work aims to
   validate the measurement of the fetal QT interval in term laboring women
   using a NI-FECG electrocardiogram monitor. Fetal electrocardiogram data
   were recorded from 22 laboring women at term using the NI-FECG and an
   invasive fetal scalp electrode simultaneously. A total of 105 one-minute
   epochs were selected for analysis. Three pediatric electrophysiologists
   independently annotated individual waveforms and averaged waveforms from
   each epoch. The intervals measured on the averaged cycles taken from the
   NI-FECG and the fetal scalp electrode showed a close agreement; the root
   mean square error between all corresponding averaged NI-FECG and fetal
   scalp electrode beats was 13.6 ms, which is lower than the lowest adult
   root mean square error of 16.1 ms observed in related adult QT studies.
   These results provide evidence that NI-FECG technology enables accurate
   extraction of the fetal QT interval.}},

Abstract = {{To analyse wellbore stability phenomena when drilling through a
   transversely isotropic formation such as shale, a wellbore stability
   model is developed based on the coordinate transformation method and
   complex variable elasticity theory. In order to comprehensively consider
   the anisotropies in the transversely isotropic formation, the model
   includes the followings: 1. the elastic anisotropy due to the
   sedimentation effect and naturally developed fractures and 2. the
   strength anisotropy due to the poor cementation between bedding planes
   and natural fractures. The model is further generalized by accounting
   for an arbitrary wellbore trajectory under an arbitrary in situ stress
   orientation. Next, the model is used in a parametric study that includes
   factors such as elastic anisotropy, strength anisotropy, multiple weak
   planes, in situ stress anisotropy, and poroelastic anisotropy, all of
   which can have a great influence on wellbore stability. Finally, a
   correction for a frequently used failure criterion has been made to
   ensure that the newly developed model is comprehensive and accurate for
   wellbore stability analyses in highly heterogeneous formations.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution and emergence of technology domains remains
   a challenge, particularly so for potentially breakthrough technologies.
   Though it is well recognized that emergence of new fields is complex and
   uncertain, to make decisions amidst such uncertainty, one needs to
   mobilize various sources of intelligence to identify known-knowns and
   known-unknowns to be able to choose appropriate strategies and policies.
   This competitive technical intelligence cannot rely on simple trend
   analyses because breakthrough technologies have little past to inform
   such trends, and positing the directions of evolution is challenging.
   Neither do qualitative tools, embracing the complexities, provide all
   the solutions, since transparent and repeatable techniques need to be
   employed to create best practices and evaluate the intelligence that
   comes from such exercises. In this paper, we present a hybrid
   roadmapping technique that draws on a number of approaches and
   integrates them into a multi-level approach (individual activities,
   industry evolutions and broader global changes) that can be applied to
   breakthrough technologies. We describe this approach in deeper detail
   through a case study on dye-sensitized solar cells. Our contribution to
   this special issue is to showcase the technique as part of a family of
   approaches that are emerging around the world to inform strategy and
   policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Classical EHL Versus Quantitative EHL: A Perspective Part
   II-Super-Arrhenius Piezoviscosity, an Essential Component of
   Elastohydrodynamic Friction Missing from Classical EHL}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Ninety years of high-pressure measurements with many different types of
   viscometers have shown that faster-than-exponential (super-Arrhenius)
   pressure dependence of viscosity is universal for glass-forming liquids
   and, therefore, all typical liquid lubricants. Dielectric spectroscopy
   at elevated pressure also yields super-Arrhenius response in the
   dependence on pressure of the primary relaxation time. In contrast,
   classical elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) has gone to great lengths
   to ignore this phenomenon, including fictional accounts of the results
   of viscometry. As a result of this, classical EHL is unable to
   quantitatively account for one of the most important properties
   affecting friction at low sliding velocity, the low-shear viscosity.
   Differences in friction between similar liquids at low sliding velocity
   can be explained by their different inflection pressures. Some observed
   liquid response to shear stress at high pressure can be explained with
   the measured super-Arrhenius pressure dependence. It should be clear
   that, had classical EHL employed realistic pressure dependence of
   viscosity from its beginning, the field would have been in a better
   position today to solve engineering problems which involve the
   differences among molecular structures.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new behavioral modeling approach for magneto-static
   hysteresis is presented. Many accurate models are currently available,
   but none of them seems to be able to correctly reproduce all the
   possible B-H paths with low computational cost. By contrast, the
   approach proposed in this paper is based on simple functions, which do
   not require calculus to be involved, thus assuring a very good
   efficiency in the algorithm. In addition, the proposed method enables
   initial magnetization curves, symmetric loops, minor loops, normal
   curves, and reversal curves of any order to be reproduced, as
   demonstrated through the pertinent results provided in this paper. A
   model example based on the proposed modeling technique is also
   introduced and used as inductor core, in order to simulate an LR series
   circuit. Finally, the model ability to emulate hysteretic inductors is
   proved by the satisfactory agreement achieved when comparing the
   measured and simulated results.}},

Title = {{Influence of structural load-bearing scaffolds on mechanical load- and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{169-181}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A common design constraint in functional tissue engineering is that
   scaffolds intended for use in load-bearing sites possess similar
   mechanical properties to the replaced tissue. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that in vivo loading would enhance bone morphogenetic
   protein-2 (BMP-2)-mediated bone regeneration in the presence of a
   load-bearing PLDL scaffold, whose pores and central core were filled
   with BMP-2-releasing alginate hydrogel. First, we evaluated the effects
   of in vivo mechanical loading on bone regeneration in the structural
   scaffolds. Second, we compared scaffold-mediated bone regeneration,
   independent of mechanical loading, with alginate hydrogel constructs,
   without the structural scaffold, that have been shown previously to
   facilitate in vivo mechanical stimulation of bone formation.
   Contrary to our hypothesis, mechanical loading had no effect on bone
   formation, distribution, or biomechanical properties in structural
   scaffolds. Independent of loading, the structural scaffolds reduced bone
   formation compared to non-structural alginate, particularly in regions
   in which the scaffold was concentrated, resulting in impaired functional
   regeneration.
   This is attributable to a combination of stress shielding by the
   scaffold and inhibition of cellular infiltration and tissue ingrowth.
   Collectively, these data question the necessity of scaffold similarity
   to mature tissue at the time of implantation and emphasize development
   of an environment conducive to cellular activation of matrix production
   and ultimate functional regeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{New processing methods for shape-memory polymers allow for tailoring
   material properties for numerous applications. Shape-memory nonwovens
   have been previously electrospun, but melt blow processing has yet to be
   evaluated. In order to determine the process parameters affecting
   shape-memory behavior, this study examined the effect of air pressure
   and collector speed on the mechanical behavior and shape-recovery of
   shape-memory polyurethane nonwovens. Mechanical behavior was measured by
   dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile testing, and shape-recovery was
   measured by unconstrained and constrained recovery. Microstructure
   changes throughout the shape-memory cycle were also investigated by
   micro-computed tomography. It was found that increasing collector speed
   increases elastic modulus, ultimate strength and recovery stress of the
   nonwoven, but collector speed does not affect the failure strain or
   unconstrained recovery. Increasing air pressure decreases the failure
   strain and increases rubbery modulus and unconstrained recovery, but air
   pressure does not influence recovery stress. It was also found that
   during the shape-memory cycle, the connectivity density of the fibers
   upon recovery does not fully return to the initial values, accounting
   for the incomplete shape-recovery seen in shape memory nonwovens. With
   these parameter to property relationships identified, shape memory
   nonwovens can be more easily manufactured and tailored for specific
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterization of biomechanical properties of aged human and ovine

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{607-618}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The mitral Valve (MV) is a highly complex cardiac valve consisting of an
   annulus, anterior and posterior leaflets, chordae tendineae (chords) and
   two papillary muscles. The chordae tendineae mechanics play a pivotal
   role in proper MV function: the chords help maintain proper leaflet
   coaptation and rupture of the chordae tendineae due to disease or aging
   can lead to mitral valve insufficiency. Therefore, the aim of this study
   was to characterize the mechanical properties of aged human and ovine
   mitral chordae tendineae. The human and ovine chordal specimens were
   categorized by insertion location (i.e., marginal, basal and strut) and
   leaflet type (i.e., anterior and posterior). The results show that human
   and ovine chords of differing types vary largely in size but do not have
   significantly different elastic and failure properties. The excess
   fibrous tissue layers surrounding the central core of human chords added
   thickness to the chords but did not contribute to the overall strength
   of the chords. In general, the thinner marginal chords were stiffer than
   the thicker basal and strut chords, and the anterior chords were stiffer
   and weaker than the posterior chords. The human chords of all types were
   significantly stiffer than the corresponding ovine chords and exhibited
   much lower failure strains. These findings can be explained by the
   diminished crimp pattern of collagen fibers of the human mitral chords
   observed histologically. Moreover, the mechanical testing data was
   modeled with the nonlinear hyperelastic Ogden strain energy function to
   facilitate accurate computational modeling of the human MV. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Highly sensitive lyriform organs located on the legs of the wandering
   spider Cupiennius salei allow the spider to detect nanometer-scale
   strains in the exoskeleton resulting from locomotion or substrate
   vibrations. Morphological features of the lyriform organs result in
   their specialization and selective sensitivity to specific mechanical
   stimuli, which make them interesting for bioinspired strain sensors.
   Here we utilize atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy
   to probe nano-scale mechanical properties of the covering membrane of
   two lyriform organs found on Cupiennius salei: the vibration sensitive
   metatarsal lyriform organ (HS10) and the proprioreceptive tibial
   lyriform organ (HS8). Force distance curves (FDCs) obtained from AFM
   measurements displayed characteristic multi-layer structure behavior,
   with calculated elastic moduli ranging from 150 MPa to 500 MPa for
   different regions and indentation depths. In addition, we probed the
   lyriform organs with a large radius tip, which allowed for probing
   structural deformation by the application of high forces and large scale
   deformations without damaging the surface. The viscoelastic behavior of
   the sensor materials observed in this probing suggests mechanical
   relaxation times potentially playing a role in the time-dependent
   behavior of the lyriform organs.}},

Abstract = {{Rotenone is a classic inhibitor of Complex I of the electron transport
   chain which is common to all life. Algae are known to be
   rotenone-insensitive because in addition to Complex I they have
   alternative pathways for the oxidation of NADH(2). It is this
   differential sensitivity to rotenone that can be exploited to reduce
   many types of predators while not affecting biodiesel-producing algae. A
   universal tool like rotenone is needed to reduce predation in open ponds
   as predation is well known to limit cultivation to a few weeks in the
   warmer months. In this study, we tested the effect of rotenone on the
   mortality and reproduction of two marine algae strains, Nannochloropsis
   oculata and Tetraselmis suecica, and two marine rotifer strains,
   Brachionus manjavacas and Brachionus rotundiformis. The LC(50)s for the
   two rotifers ranged from 0.18 to 0.35 mu M while N. oculata was
   unaffected to at least 7.6 mu M. Rotifer reproduction was reduced at
   rotenone concentrations lower than those that caused mortality. Rotenone
   applications to produce 1 million gallons of biodiesel in one year are
   estimated to cost \$1684. This provides algae farmers an important and
   inexpensive tool to manage grazing predators in algae mass cultures and
   avoid pond crashes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the optimization of the coefficient of
   performance of an ejector based chiller through changes in the two-phase
   flow characteristics inside the ejector using wet R134a and dry R245fa
   fluids. Reducing the superheat at the motive nozzle inlet results in a
   12-13\% increase in COP with a 14-16 K drop in driving waste heat
   temperature. The roles of momentum transfer, heat transfer, and
   two-phase flow on performance are delineated. The change in COP appears
   to be a combination of the choice of fluid and the effect of phase
   change on momentum transfer effectiveness. Larger degrees of
   condensation reduce momentum transfer effectiveness; however, energy
   savings from reduced motive superheating compensates for the effect of
   condensation, and causes a net increase in COP. It is recommended that
   ejector-based chillers be operated such that the motive nozzle inlet is
   near saturation, and dry fluids like R245fa are used to improve
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient gradient-based optimization approach
   for reliability-based topology optimization of structures under
   uncertainties. Our objective is to find the optimized topology of
   structures with minimum weight which also satisfy certain reliability
   requirements. In the literature, those problems are primarily performed
   with approaches that use a first-order reliability method (FORM) to
   estimate the gradient of the probability of failure. However, these
   approaches may lead to deficient or even invalid results because the
   gradient of probabilistic constraints, calculated by first order
   approximation, might not be sufficiently accurate. To overcome this
   issue, a newly developed segmental multi-point linearization (SML)
   method is employed in the optimization approach for a more accurate
   estimation of the gradient of failure probability. Meanwhile, this
   implementation also improves the approximation of the probability
   evaluation at no extra cost. In general, adoption of the SML method
   leads to a more accurate and robust approach. Numerical examples show
   that the new approach, based on the SML method, is numerically stable
   and usually provides optimized structures that have more of the desired
   features than conventional FORM-based approaches. The present approach
   typically does not lead to a fully stressed design, and thus this
   feature will be verified by numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a full-space barrier method designed for
   stress-constrained mass minimization problems with discrete material
   options. The advantages of the full-space barrier method are twofold.
   First, in the full-space the stress constraints are provably concave,
   which facilitates the construction of convex subproblems within the
   optimization algorithm. Second, by using the full-space, it is no longer
   necessary to employ stress constraint aggregation techniques to reduce
   adjoint-gradient evaluation costs. The proposed optimization algorithm
   uses a Newton method where an approximate linearization of the KKT
   conditions is solved inexactly at each iteration using a preconditioned
   Krylov subspace method. Sparse constraints that arise in the discrete
   material parametrization are treated using a null-space method. Results
   of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated on a series of three topology
   and multimaterial optimization problems with selection between isotropic
   and orthotropic materials, as well as discrete ply-angle selection.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades research on travel mode choice has evolved from
   work that is informed by utility theory, examining the effects of
   objective determinants, to studies incorporating more subjective
   variables such as habits and attitudes. Recently, the way people
   perceive their travel has been analyzed with transportation-oriented
   scales of subjective well-being, and particularly the satisfaction with
   travel scale. However, studies analyzing the link between travel mode
   choice (i.e., decision utility) and travel satisfaction (i.e.,
   experienced utility) are limited. In this paper we will focus on the
   relation between mode choice and travel satisfaction for leisure trips
   (with travel-related attitudes and the built environment as explanatory
   variables) of study participants in urban and suburban neighborhoods in
   the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is shown that the built environment and
   travel-related attitudes-both important explanatory variables of travel
   mode choice-and mode choice itself affect travel satisfaction. Public
   transit users perceive their travel most negatively, while active travel
   results in the highest levels of travel satisfaction. Surprisingly,
   suburban dwellers perceive their travel more positively than urban
   dwellers, for all travel modes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to study the occurrence, fate, and
   seasonal variations of pharmaceuticals at two urban wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs) in India and compare the results with a similar study
   conducted in the United States. This is the first study of its kind in
   comparing occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater of two
   different countries with the same methodology and analytical techniques.
   Twelve most relevant pharmaceuticals were selected for seasonal
   monitoring at two Indian WWTPs based on the comprehensive survey and
   through literature review. The yearly average influent concentrations of
   total pharmaceuticals were found to be 537 +/- 5 mu g/L at WWTP-1 and
   353 +/- 9 mu g/L at WWTP-2. WWTP-2 exhibited comparatively higher
   removal efficiency of total pharmaceuticals (85\% versus 59\%, excluding
   monsoon season), possibly due to the cyclic activated sludge technology
   followed by chlorination employed at WWTP-2. Comparison with a similar
   study conducted in the United States revealed that concentration of most
   of the pharmaceuticals detected in the U.S. WWTPs were, on an average,
   more than 50\% lower. U.S. WWTPs also exhibited 10-30\% higher removal
   efficiencies for total pharmaceuticals. Our study results show that
   preliminary treatment and biological treatment alone are not adequate
   for complete removal of pharmaceuticals and polishing step and tertiary
   treatment is a necessity if higher removal of pharmaceuticals is desired
   in Indian WWTPs. Information obtained from this study will not only aid
   the local utilities but will also benefit understanding of global trends
   in usage of pharmaceuticals and their distribution in the environment.

Abstract = {{Fracture theory for normal strength concrete has thoroughly been studied
   over the past decades. Through indirect and direct tensile testing
   techniques, the post-peak softening response of conventional concrete
   has been established and utilized in analysis and design. However, for
   more recently developed concrete materials (e.g. fiber reinforced, high
   performance) under complex loading conditions, the required fracture
   properties to predict response are extremely limited. Considering this
   lack of knowledge, the objective of this research was to develop a
   uni-axial tensile testing technique to attain the post-peak softening
   response for ultra-high performance concrete for ultimate use in
   conjunction with an applied confining pressure system. Specifically,
   this research was conducted for implementation into an existing, large
   compression-only machine at the US Army Engineer Research and
   Development Center (ERDC). The new methodology enabled the existing
   testing frame to apply a stiffening force, while an external hydraulic
   plunger cylinder performed the tensile test. The scheme enables tensile
   testing under confining pressures in the compression-only machine.}},

Abstract = {{Steroid hormones regulate a wide variety of physiological and
   developmental functions. Traditional steroid hormone signaling acts
   through nuclear and cytosolic receptors, altering gene transcription and
   subsequently regulating cellular activity. This is particularly
   important in hormonally-responsive cancers, where therapies that target
   classical steroid hormone receptors have become clinical staples in the
   treatment and management of disease. Much progress has been made in the
   last decade in detecting novel receptors and elucidating their
   mechanisms, particularly their rapid signaling effects and subsequent
   impact on tumorigenesis. Many of these receptors are membrane-bound and
   lack DNA-binding sites, functionally separating them from their
   classical cytosolic receptor counterparts. Membrane-bound receptors have
   been implicated in a number of pathways that disrupt the cell cycle and
   impact tumorigenesis. Among these are pathways that involve
   phospholipase D, phospholipase C, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase. The
   crosstalk between these pathways has been shown to affect apoptosis and
   proliferation in cardiac cells, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes as well as
   cancer cells. This review focuses on rapid signaling by 17
   beta-estradiol and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 to examine the
   integrated actions of classical and rapid steroid signaling pathways
   both in contrast to each other and in concert with other rapid signaling
   pathways. This new approach lends insight into rapid signaling by
   steroid hormones and its potential for use in targeted drug therapies
   that maximize the benefits of traditional steroid hormone-directed
   therapies while mitigating their less desirable effects. (C) 2016

Title = {{Development and evaluation of a daily temporal interpolation model for

Abstract = {{The impacts of emissions sources on air quality in St. Louis, Missouri
   are assessed for use in acute health effects studies. However, like many
   locations in the United States, the speciated particulate matter (PM)
   measurements from regulatory monitoring networks in St. Louis are only
   available every third day. The power of studies investigating acute
   health effects of air pollution is reduced when using one-in-three day
   source impacts compared to daily source impacts. This paper presents a
   temporal interpolation model to estimate daily speciated PM2.5 mass
   concentrations and source impact estimates using one-in three day
   measurements. The model is used to interpolate 1-in-3 day source impact
   estimates and to interpolate the 1-in-3 day PM species concentrations
   prior to source apportionment (SA). Both approaches are compared and
   evaluated using two years (June 2001 May 2003) of daily data from the
   St. Louis Midwest Supersite (STL-SS). Data withholding is used to
   simulate a 1-in-3 day data set from the daily data to evaluate
   interpolated estimates. After evaluation using the STL-SS data, the
   model is used to estimate daily source impacts at another site
   approximately seven kilometers (7 km) northwest of the STL-SS (Blair);
   results between the sites are compared. For interpolated species
   concentrations, the model performs better for secondary species
   (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organic carbon) than for primary
   species (metals and elemental carbon), likely due to the greater spatial
   autocorrelation of secondary species. Pearson correlation (R) values for
   sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, and organic carbon ranged
   from 0.61 (elemental carbon, EC2) to 0.97 (sulfate). For trace metals,
   the R values ranged from 0.31 (Ba) to 0.81 (K). The interpolated source
   impact estimates also indicated a stronger correlation for secondary
   sources. Correlations of the secondary source impact estimates based on
   measurement data and interpolation data ranged from 0.68 to 0.97,
   whereas for primary source contribution estimates the correlations
   ranged from 0.042 to 0.95. Comparison of daily source impact estimates
   with source impacts from the interpolation models indicated that
   interpolation of source contributions was preferable over interpolating
   species concentrations then applying a SA model. This was based on
   better agreement in the predicted source impact concentrations and
   higher correlation with daily SA results. Overall, this study indicates
   that the temporal interpolation model produces results that may be used
   to estimate source impacts for health studies, though the additional
   uncertainty should be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Millennials, defined in this study as those born between 1979 and 2000,
   became the largest population segment in the United States in 2015.
   Compared to recent previous generations, they have been found to travel
   less, own fewer cars, have lower driver's licensure rates, and use
   alternative modes more. But to what extent will these differences in
   behaviour persist as millennials move through various phases of the
   lifecycle? To address this question, this paper presents the results of
   a longitudinal analysis of the 2003-2013 American Time Use Survey data
   series. In early adulthood, younger millennials (born 1988-1994) are
   found to spend significantly more time in-home than older millennials
   (born 1979-1985), which indicates that there are substantial differences
   in activity-time use patterns across generations in early adulthood.
   Older millennials are, however, showing activity-time use patterns
   similar to their prior generation counterparts as they age, although
   some differences - particularly in time spent as a car driver - persist.
   Millennials appear to exhibit a lag in adopting the activity patterns of
   predecessor generations due to delayed lifecycle milestones (e.g.
   completing their education, getting jobs, marrying, and having children)
   and lingering effects of the economic recession, suggesting that travel
   demand will resume growth in the future.}},

Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{227-236}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In granular assemblies such as soil, ballast, cementitious aggregates,
   food and medical products, particle fragmentation and crushing alter
   material properties. The goal of this research work is to better
   understand the microstructure parameters that control the triggering of
   fragmentation, and to predict how microstructure evolution consequent to
   crushing can actually enhance or reduce material properties. We focused
   on size and shielding effects, which respectively refer to the decrease
   of particle strength with increasing particle size, and to the increase
   of particle strength with the redistribution of stress towards
   hydrostatic stress conditions upon crushing of neighboring particles. We
   calibrated the parameters of a Distinct Element Method (DEM) cluster
   model of crushable particle so as to match the displacement and axial
   force obtained experimentally at the first particle fragmentation. In
   order to study the influence of the coordination number on particle
   crushing, we modeled the mechanical confinement effect of neighboring
   particles by placing rigid walls around the DEM cluster. In order to
   understand why larger particles have lower tensile strength, we studied
   size effects on the crushing process of clusters with and without
   internal flaws. We found that for clusters with a porosity ranging
   between 0\% and 30\%, tensile strength only depends on porosity and not
   on flaw size. Overall results show that particle strength depends: (1)
   linearly on particle coordination number; (2) quadratically on particle
   porosity. Theoretical and DEM modeling of particle crushing will advance
   the fundamental understanding of energy transfer in particulate media.

Abstract = {{The current study presents the effect of geometric parameters such as
   horizontal curvature, abutment skew, and column height on the seismic
   response and fragility of curved multi-frame concrete box girder bridges
   with in-span hinges. For this purpose, two as-built bridges with
   integral abutments (two- and three-frame) with typical configurations of
   this class of bridges in California are selected to create a detailed
   three-dimensional inelastic model for each bridge. The model is used to
   perform a set of nonlinear time history analyses for a ground motion
   suite to compute the fragility function of components and system.
   Moreover, multiple levels of each geometric parameter are determined to
   identify the effect of geometry. As-built bridge models are modified by
   varying one of each parameter and the modified models are repeatedly
   simulated for the seismic fragility assessment. Outcomes are used to
   examine the above parameters affecting seismic demands and fragility
   curves for this class of bridges. It is observed that most geometric
   parameters significantly affect fragilities for some components, but not
   all system fragilities; the column height is the most influence
   parameter affecting the system fragility while the horizontal curvature
   and abutment skew have a relatively minimal influence on the system
   fragility of this class of bridges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   between annular and intermittent flow and predict the applicable
   pressure drop based on a model that accounts for the effects of G, x,
   T-sat, D-h and AR. The model predicts 95\% of the data within +/- 25\%.
   The relative predominance of the two flow regimes predicted by the AFF
   is in agreement with findings of Coleman and Garimella (2000, 2003).
   Constant AFF lines may also be used as transition criteria for the
   application of intermittent or annular flow based models. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The bulk modulus of nanocrystalline, fluorite-structured samarium doped
   ceria, Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, has been investigated using synchrotron-based
   high-pressure X-ray diffraction technique. Experiments were carried out
   under both quasi-hydrostatic condition with silicon oil pressure
   transmitting medium (PTM) and nonhydrostatic conditions without PTM. The
   high pressure structural results indicate that the highly defected ionic
   conductor is stable up to 20 GPa and has a lower bulk modulus than what
   has been reported for undoped-CeO2. The isothermal bulk modulus of
   Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 is similar to 150-190 GPa compared to similar to 210-220
   GPa for CeO2. The collected data experimentally verifies the effect of
   Sm3+ dopant and oxygen vacancy defect formation on bulk modulus in doped
   CeO2. The effect of modulus on misfit dislocation formation and dopant
   ion segregation is discussed in relation to a fundamental understanding
   of the strain effect in this important family of fast ionic conductors,
   with potential application as oxygen vacancy conducting solid state
   electrolytes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent work we have proposed a theoretical framework for developing
   optimized scheduling policies for complex resource allocation systems
   (RAS). This framework relies heavily on the expression of the RAS
   dynamics in the modeling framework of the Generalized Stochastic Petri
   Nets (GSPNs), and the employment of this GSPN-based representation
   towards the establishment of a systematic trade-off between the
   representational economy of the target scheduling policies and their
   operational efficiency. In this paper, we enhance the representational
   economy of the target policies in the aforementioned framework by taking
   advantage of some notions of ``(non-)conflict{''} in the transitional
   dynamics of the underlying RAS-modeling GSPNs. A series of numerical
   experiments demonstrate that the representational gains resulting from
   the presented methodology can be very substantial.}},

   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and small-angle
   X-ray diffraction, respectively. Thereinto, the HFPDB-based PMO thin
   film with weight ratio of porogen to precursor (0.75:1) possesses
   excellent dielectric property (1.58@1 MHz of dielectric constants), high
   mechanical property (5.54 +/- 0.11 GPa of Young's modulus) and

Abstract = {{The results from an experimental investigation of condensing zeotropic
   mixtures of hydrocarbons inside horizontal tubes are presented. The
   trends in heat transfer coefficient with temperature glide, saturation
   pressure, concentration, mass flux, and quality and tube diameter are
   discussed with reference to the changing thermodynamic and physical
   phenomena across the condensing conditions. The modeling techniques most
   commonly used to account for the non-equilibrium conditions and changes
   in the bubble and dew point temperatures affecting the condensing heat
   transfer coefficient are assessed. The degradation in heat transfer
   coefficient due to mixture effects is most significant at large
   temperature glides and in the larger tube diameter, and is least
   significant at higher mass fluxes. The data are analyzed using the
   Silver Bell Ghaly approach as well as the Colburn and Drew framework.
   The study provides insight into the behavior of zeotropic mixtures
   during condensation. The conditions that results in the largest

Title = {{Inferring metabolic pathway activity levels from RNA-Seq data}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Assessing pathway activity levels is a plausible way to
   quantify metabolic differences between various conditions. This is
   usually inferred from microarray expression data. Wide availability of
   NGS technology has triggered a demand for bioinformatics tools capable
   of analyzing pathway activity directly from RNA-Seq data. In this paper
   we introduce XPathway, a set of tools that compares pathway activity
   analyzing mapping of contigs assembled from RNA-Seq reads to KEGG
   pathways. The XPathway analysis of pathway activity is based on
   expectation maximization and topological properties of pathway graphs.
   Results: XPathway tools have been applied to RNA-Seq data from the
   marine bryozoan Bugula neritina with and without its symbiotic bacterium
   ``Candidatus Endobugula sertula{''}. We successfully identified several
   metabolic pathways with differential activity levels. The expression of
   enzymes from the identified pathways has been further validated through
   quantitative PCR (qPCR).
   Conclusions: Our results show that XPathway is able to detect and
   quantify the metabolic difference in two samples. The software is
   implemented in C, Python and shell scripting and is capable of running
   on Linux/Unix platforms. The source code and installation instructions
   are available at http://alan.cs.gsu.edu/NGS/? q=content/xpathway.}},

Title = {{24R,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Protects against Articular Cartilage Damage
   following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Transection in Male Rats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) in humans is associated with low circulating
   25-hydroxyvitamin D3 {[}25(OH)D-3]. In vitamin D replete rats,
   radiolabeled 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 {[}24R,25(OH)(2)D-3] accumulates
   in articular cartilage following injection of {[}H-3]-25(OH)D-3.
   Previously, we showed that 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 blocks chondrocyte apoptosis
   via phospholipase D and p53, suggesting a role for 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 in
   maintaining cartilage health. We examined the ability of
   24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 to prevent degenerative changes in articular cartilage
   in an OA-like environment and the potential mechanisms involved. In
   vitro, rat articular chondrocytes were treated with IL-1 beta with and
   without 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 or 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 but
   not 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 blocked the effects of IL-1 beta in a
   dose-dependent manner, and its effect was partially mediated through the
   TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway. In vivo, unilateral anterior cruciate
   ligament transections were performed in immunocompetent rats followed by
   intra-articular injections of 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 or vehicle (t = 0, 7, 14,
   21 days). Tissues were harvested on day 28. Joints treated with vehicle
   had changes typical of OA whereas joints treated with 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3
   had less articular cartilage damage and levels of inflammatory
   mediators. These results indicate that 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 protects against
   OA, and suggest that it may be a therapeutic approach for preventing
   trauma-induced osteoarthritis.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{324}},

Abstract = {{While the coking resistance of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
   anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) toward hydrocarbon fuel can be
   improved by adding SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-x (SZY) as a proton conductor, the
   exact mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the surface chemistry
   of SZY is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy to clarify the
   coking resistance mechanism. Upon exposure to dry propane at 500 degrees
   C, the intensity of the Raman peaks corresponding to -CO3 species
   decreases with time, suggesting that the surface-located -CO3 groups are
   consumed through a reaction with deposited carbon or dry reforming of
   propane, which reduces the tendency of coking. These consumed -CO3
   groups can then be regenerated through a reaction between water vapor
   and deposited carbon. The presence of adsorbed water on SZY, which
   facilitates a carbon removal reaction and the steam reforming of
   propane, is confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The
   reactivity of the -CO3 groups and the adsorbed water on SZY thus
   contribute to removing deposited carbon, resulting in the improved
   coking resistance of Ni/YSZ-SZY anode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To develop novel nanomaterial for online detection and diagnosis of

   first-principle density functional theory (DFT) methods implemented in
   the DMol(3) package of Materials Studio. Three interaction models,
   single molecule, double identical molecules and double foreign molecules
   adsorption, have been studied to fully characterize the gas sensing
   mechanism under different situations. Simulation results reveal that
   Ni-SWCNTs have different sensitivity and selectivity to SO2 than SOF2
   and SO2F2. The conductivity of Ni-SWCNTs increases in the following
   order: SO2 > SOF2 after SO2 and SOF2 adsorption. Conversely, the
   adsorption of SO2F2 onto Ni-SWCNTs slightly decreases its conductivity.

Abstract = {{Maternal and neonatal tetanus claim tens of thousands lives every year
   in developing countries, but could be prevented by hygienic practices
   and improved immunization of pregnantwomen. This study tested the
   hypothesis that skin vaccination can overcome the immunologically
   transformed state of pregnancy and enhance protective immunity to
   tetanus in mothers and their newborns. To achieve this goal, we
   developed microneedle patches (MNPs) that efficiently delivered
   unadjuvanted tetanus toxoid to skin of pregnantmice and demonstrated
   that this route induced superior immune responses in female mice
   conferring 100\% survival to tetanus toxin challenge when compared to
   intramuscular vaccination. Mice born to MNP-vaccinated mothers showed
   detectable tetanus-specific IgG antibodies up to 12 weeks of age and
   complete protection to tetanus toxin challenge up at 6 weeks of age. In
   contrast, none of the 6-week old mice born to intramuscularly vaccinated
   mothers survived challenge. Although pregnant mice vaccinated with
   unadjuvanted tetanus toxoid had 30\% lower IgG and IgG1 titers than mice
   vaccinated intramuscularly with Alum (R)-adjuvanted tetanus toxoid
   vaccine, IgG2a titers and antibody affinity maturation were similar
   between these groups. We conclude that skin immunization with MNPs
   containing unadjuvanted tetanus toxoid can confer potent protective
   efficacy to mothers and their offspring using a delivery method well
   suited for expanding vaccination coverage in developing countries. (C)

Title = {{A split-optimization approach for obtaining multiple solutions in
   single-objective process parameter optimization}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{It can be observed from the experimental data of different processes
   that different process parameter combinations can lead to the same
   performance indicators, but during the optimization of process
   parameters, using current techniques, only one of these combinations can
   be found when a given objective function is specified. The combination
   of process parameters obtained after optimization may not always be
   applicable in actual production or may lead to undesired experimental
   conditions. In this paper, a split-optimization approach is proposed for
   obtaining multiple solutions in a single-objective process parameter
   optimization problem. This is accomplished by splitting the original
   search space into smaller sub-search spaces and using GA in each
   sub-search space to optimize the process parameters. Two different
   methods, i.e., cluster centers and hill and valley splitting strategy,
   were used to split the original search space, and their efficiency was
   measured against a method in which the original search space is split
   into equal smaller sub-search spaces. The proposed approach was used to
   obtain multiple optimal process parameter combinations for
   electrochemical micromachining. The result obtained from the case study
   showed that the cluster centers and hill and valley splitting strategies
   were more efficient in splitting the original search space than the
   method in which the original search space is divided into smaller equal
   sub-search spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical reactivity and ionic transport at the nanoscale are
   essential in many energy applications. In this study, time-resolved
   Kelvin probe force microscopy (tr-KPFM) is utilized for surface
   potential mapping of nanostructured ceria, in both space and time
   domains. The fundamental mechanisms of proton injection and transport
   are studied as a function of environmental conditions and the presence
   or absence of triple phase boundaries. Finite element modeling is used
   to extract physical parameters from the experimental data, allowing not
   only quantification of the observed processes, but also decoupling of
   their contributions to the measured signal. The constructed phase
   diagrams of the parameters demonstrate a thermally activated proton
   injection reaction at the triple phase boundary, and two transport
   processes that are responsible for the low-temperature proton
   conductivity of nanostructured ceria.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{We study longitudinal and transverse wave propagation in beams with
   elastic properties that are periodically varying in space and time.
   Spatiotemporal modulation of the elastic properties breaks mechanical
   reciprocity and induces one-way propagation. We follow an analytic
   approach to characterize the non-reciprocal behavior of the structures
   by analyzing the symmetry breaking of the dispersion spectrum, which
   results in the formation of directional band gaps and produces shifts of
   the first Brillouin zone limits. This approach allows us to relate
   position and width of the directional band gaps to the modulation
   parameters. Moreover, we identify the critical values of the modulation
   speed to maximize the non-reciprocal effect. We numerically verify the
   theoretical predictions by using a finite element model of the modulated
   beams to compute the transient response of the structure. We compute the
   two-dimensional Fourier transform of the collected displacement fields
   to calculate numerical band diagrams, showing excellent agreement
   between theoretical and numerical dispersion diagrams.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean waves are one of the most promising renewable energy sources for
   large-scope applications due to the abundant water resources on the
   earth. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology could provide a new
   strategy for water wave energy harvesting. In this work, we investigated
   the charging characteristics of utilizing a wavy-structured TENG to
   charge a capacitor under direct water wave impact and under enclosed
   ball collision, by combination of theoretical calculations and
   experimental studies. The analytical equations of the charging
   characteristics were theoretically derived for the two cases, and they
   were calculated for various load capacitances, cycle numbers, and
   structural parameters such as compression deformation depth and ball
   size or mass. Under the direct water wave impact, the stored energy and
   maximum energy storage efficiency were found to be controlled by
   deformation depth, while the stored energy and maximum efficiency can be
   optimized by the ball size under the enclosed ball collision. Finally,
   the theoretical results were well verified by the experimental tests.
   The present work could provide strategies for improving the charging
   performance of TENGs toward effective water wave energy harvesting and
   storage.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new strategy to enhance the catalytic durability of Pt-Ni
   octahedral nanocrystals in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by
   conformally depositing an ultrathin Pt shell on the surface. The Pt-Ni
   octahedra were synthesized according to a protocol reported previously
   and then employed directly as seeds for the conformal deposition of
   ultrathin Pt shells by introducing a Pt precursor dropwise at 200
   degrees C. The amount of Pt precursor was adjusted relative to the
   number of Pt-Ni octahedra involved to obtain Pt-Ni@Pt-1.5L octahedra of
   12nm in edge length for the systematic evaluation of their chemical
   stability and catalytic durability compared to Pt-Ni octahedra.
   Specifically, we compared the elemental compositions of the octahedra
   before and after treatment with acetic and sulfuric acids. We also
   examined their electrocatalytic stability toward the ORR through an
   accelerated durability test by using a rotating disk electrode method.
   Even after treatment with sulfuric acid for 24h, the Pt-Ni@Pt-1.5L
   octahedra maintained their original Ni content, whereas 11\% of the Ni
   was lost from the Pt-Ni octahedra. After 10000cycles of ORR, the mass
   activity of the Pt-Ni octahedra decreased by 75\%, whereas the
   Pt-Ni@Pt-1.5L octahedra only showed a 25\% reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Selectin-ligand interactions mediate tethering and rolling of
   circulating leukocytes on the vessel wall during inflammation. Extensive
   study has been devoted to elucidating the kinetic and mechanical
   constraints of receptor-ligand-interaction-mediated leukocyte adhesion,
   yet many questions remain unanswered. Here, we describe our design of an
   inverted flow chamber to compare adhesions of HL-60 cells to E-selectin
   in the upright and inverted orientations. This new, to our knowledge,
   design allowed us to evaluate the effect of gravity and to investigate
   the mechanisms of flow-enhanced adhesion. Cell rolling in the two
   orientations was qualitatively similar, and the quantitative differences
   can be explained by the effect of gravity, which promotes free-flowing
   cells to tether and detached cells to reattach to the surface in the
   upright orientation but prevents such attachment from happening in the
   inverted orientation. We characterized rolling stability by the lifetime
   of rolling adhesion and detachment of rolling cells, which could be
   easily measured in the inverted orientation, but not in the upright
   orientation because of the reattachment of transiently detached cells.
   Unlike the transient tether lifetime of E-selectin-ligand interaction,
   which exhibited triphasic slip-catch-slip bonds, the lifetime of rolling
   adhesion displayed a biphasic trend that first increased with the wall
   shear stress, reached a maximum at 0.4 dyn/cm(2), and then decreased
   gradually. We have developed a minimal mathematical model for the
   probability of rolling adhesion. Comparison of the theoretical
   predictions to data has provided model validation and allowed evaluation
   of the effective two-dimensional association on-rate, k(on), and the
   binding affinity, K-a, of the E-selectin-ligand interaction. k(on)
   increased with the wall shear stress from 0.1 to 0.7 dyn/cm(2). K-a
   first increased with the wall shear stress, reached a maximum at 0.4
   dyn/cm(2), and then decreased gradually. Our results provide insights
   into how the interplay between flow-dependent on-rate and off-rate of
   E-selectin-ligand bonds determine flow-enhanced cell rolling stability.}},

Abstract = {{Kinesin motor proteins transport intracellular cargoes throughout cells
   by hydrolyzing ATP and moving along microtubule tracks. Intramolecular
   autoinhibitory interactions have been shown for several kinesins in
   vitro; however, the physiological significance of autoinhibition remains
   poorly understood. Here, we identified four mutations in the stalk
   region and motor domain of the synaptic vesicle (SV) kinesin
   UNC-104/KIF1A that specifically disrupt autoinhibition. These mutations
   augment both microtubule and cargo vesicle binding in vitro. In vivo,
   these mutations cause excessive activation of UNC-104, leading to
   decreased synaptic density, smaller synapses, and ectopic localization
   of SVs in the dendrite. We also show that the SV-bound small GTPase
   ARL-8 activates UNC-104 by unlocking the autoinhibition. These results
   demonstrate that the autoinhibitory mechanism is used to regulate the
   distribution of transport cargoes and is important for synaptogenesis in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the dissociation mechanism of the C-N bond between
   carbazole and dibenzothiophene in carbazole-dibenzothiophene (Cz-DBT)
   positional isomers, selected as representative systems for blue host
   materials in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The C-N bond
   dissociation energies, calculated at the density functional theory
   level, are found to depend strongly on the charge states of the parental
   molecules. In particular, the anionic C-N bond dissociations resulting
   in a carbazole anion can have low dissociation energies (similar to 1.6
   eV) with respect to blue emission energy. These low values are
   attributed to the large electron affinity of the carbazole radical, a
   feature that importantly can be modulated via substitution. Substitution
   also impacts the energies of the first excited electronic states of the
   CzDBT molecules since these states have an intramolecular
   charge-transfer nature due to the spatially localized character of the
   frontier molecular orbitals within the carbazole moiety (for the HOMO)
   and the dibenzothiophene moiety (for the LUMO). The implications of
   these results must be considered when designing blue OLED hosts since
   these materials must combine chemical stability and high triplet energy.}},

Abstract = {{Photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins, PICUP, was extended
   to core shell silica-polypeptide composite particles to produce
   poly(colloid)s. Silica particles coated with poly(L-tyrosine),
   PTYR-SiO2, served as the monomer units. The PICUP reaction accomplished
   the formation of dityrosil linkages between the tyrosine units by
   illumination of photo-oxidizing ruthenium(II) bipyridyl catalyst under
   physiological conditions. The PICUP method was compared with an
   enzymatic route intermediated by horseradish peroxidase as catalyst. The
   PTYR-SiO2 particles feature high PTYR content in the shell, which
   facilitated the formation of heavily cross-linked but unstructured
   aggregates. After magnetic alignment of superparamagnetic
   PTYR-SiO2-cobalt composite particles, only the PICUP approach enabled
   the preparation of isolated chain-like poly(colloid)s. The cross linking
   products were confirmed by FTIR The native secondary structure of
   poly(L-tyrosine) is preserved in these poly(colloid)s. Because the PICUP
   reaction does not require the modification of the polypeptide structure,
   the cross-linked PTYR will retain its characteristic functions as a
   poly(amino acid). The PICUP method opens the door to a variety of
   PTYR-based poly(colloid) architectures.}},

Abstract = {{The mobility of defects such as dislocations controls the mechanical

   important for understanding fundamental deformation mechanisms. Here, we
   demonstrate a method of measuring local stresses and strains during
   continuous in situ deformation with a resolution of a few nanometers
   using nanodiffraction strain mapping. Our results demonstrate how large
   multidimensional data sets captured with high speed electron detectors
   can be analyzed in multiple ways after an in situ TEM experiment,
   opening the door for true multimodal analysis from a single electron
   scattering experiment. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   strong compressive strain experienced by Al0.04Ga0.96N favors 3D island

   interlayer upon the completion of AlN template layer properly managed
   the strain such that the Al0.30Ga0.70N/Al0.04Ga0.96N DBR was able to be
   grown with an atomically smooth surface morphology. Smooth surfaces and
   sharp interfaces were observed throughout the structure using high-angle

   indirect nature of current HO2 measurements introduces challenges in
   accurately measuring HO2; therefore a direct technique would help
   constrain HOx chemistry in the atmosphere. In this work we evaluate the
   feasibility of using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) and
   propose a direct HO2 detection scheme using bromide as a reagent ion.
   Ambient observations were made with a high-resolution time-of-flight
   chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-CIMS) in Atlanta over the
   month of June 2015 to demonstrate the capability of this direct
   measurement technique. Observations displayed expected diurnal profiles,
   reaching daytime median values of similar to 5 ppt between 2 and 3 p.m.
   local time. The HO2 diurnal profile was found to be influenced by
   morning-time vehicular NOx emissions and shows a slow decrease into the
   evening, likely from non-photolytic production, among other factors.
   Measurement sensitivities of approximately 5.1 +/- 1.0 cps ppt(-1) for a
   bromide ion (Br-79(-)) count rate of 10(6) cps were observed. The
   relatively low instrument background allowed for a 3 sigma lower
   detection limit of 0.7 ppt for a 1 min integration time. Mass spectra of
   ambient measurements showed the (BrHO2-)-Br-79 peak was the major
   component of the signal at nominal mass-to-charge 112, suggesting high
   selectivity for HO2 at this mass-to-charge. More importantly, this
   demonstrates that these measurements can be achieved using instruments
   with only unit mass resolution capability.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technological advances have opened unprecedented opportunities
   for large-scale sequencing and analysis of populations of pathogenic
   species in disease outbreaks, as well as for large-scale diversity
   studies aimed at expanding our knowledge across the whole domain of
   prokaryotes. To meet the challenge of timely interpretation of
   structure, function and meaning of this vast genetic information, a
   comprehensive approach to automatic genome annotation is critically
   needed. In collaboration with Georgia Tech, NCBI has developed a new
   approach to genome annotation that combines alignment based methods with
   methods of predicting protein-coding and RNA genes and other functional
   elements directly from sequence. A new gene finding tool, GeneMarkS+,
   uses the combined evidence of protein and RNA placement by homology as
   an initial map of annotation to generate and modify ab initio gene
   predictions across the whole genome. Thus, the new NCBI's Prokaryotic
   Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) relies more on sequence similarity
   when confident comparative data are available, while it relies more on
   statistical predictions in the absence of external evidence. The
   pipeline provides a framework for generation and analysis of annotation
   on the full breadth of prokaryotic taxonomy. For additional information
   on PGAP see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation prok/ and the
   NCBI Handbook, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK174280/.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the penetrant transport properties of water,
   oxygen, and carbon dioxide at 35 degrees C in poly(ethylene
   2,5-furanoate) (PEF) isothermally crystallized at 115 and 160 degrees C.
   Dual-mode analysis of the water sorption isotherms for the
   semicrystalline vs. amorphous PEF samples indicates that the Henry's law
   sorption parameter (k(D)) is reduced for the semicrystalline samples in
   direct proportion to the volume fraction crystallinity measured via both
   density and thermal methods. While the k(D) for water obeys the simple
   two-phase model of crystallinity, an unexpected large reduction in the
   Langmuir capacity constant (C-H') for the semicrystalline vs. amorphous
   samples resulted in an overall reduction in water sorption capacity
   greater than predicted by the two-phase model. Corroboration of this
   behavior for water is provided by independent oxygen and carbon dioxide
   permeation and sorption measurements, which also exhibit larger than
   expected reductions in solubility for the semicrystalline vs. amorphous
   samples. This study, which complements prior work, provides an initial
   look into the effect of crystallinity and morphology on the penetrant
   transport properties of PEF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafast energy and electron transfer (EnT and ET, respectively) are
   characterized in a light-harvesting assembly based on a pi-conjugated
   polymer (poly(fluorene)) functionalized with broadly absorbing pendant
   organic isoindigo (iI) chromophores using a combination of femtosecond
   transient absorption spectroscopy and large-scale computer simulation.
   Photoexcitation of the pi-conjugated polymer leads to near-unity The of
   the excitation through a combination of EnT and ET to the iI pendants.
   The excited pendants formed by EnT rapidly relax within 30 ps, whereas
   recombination of the charge-separated state formed following ET occurs
   within 1200 ps. A computer model of the excited-state, processes is
   developed by combining all-atom Molecular dynamics simulations, which
   provides a molecular-level view of the assembly structure, with a
   kinetic model that accounts for the multiple excited-state quenching
   pathways. Direct comparison of the simulations with experimental data
   reveals that the underlying structure has a dramatic effect on the
   partitioning between EnT and ET in the polymer assembly, where the
   distance and orientation of the pendants in relation to the backbone
   serve to direct the dominant quenching pathway.}},

Abstract = {{DNA molecules have been widely recognized as promising building blocks
   for constructing functional nanostructures with two main features, that
   is, self-assembly and rich chemical functionality. The intrinsic feature
   size of DNA makes it attractive for creating versatile nanostructures.
   Moreover, the ease of access to tune the surface of DNA by chemical
   functionalization offers numerous opportunities for many applications.
   Herein, a simple yet robust strategy is developed to yield the
   self-assembly of DNA by exploiting controlled evaporative assembly of
   DNA solution in a unique confined geometry. Intriguingly, depending on
   the concentration of DNA solution, highly aligned nanostructured
   fibrillar-like arrays and well-positioned concentric ring-like
   superstructures composed of DNAs are formed. Subsequently, the ring-like
   negatively charged DNA superstructures are employed as template to
   produce conductive organic nanowires on a silicon substrate by
   complexing with a positively charged conjugated polyelectrolyte
   poly{[}9,9-bis(6'-N,N,N-trimethylammoniumhexyl) fluorene dibromide]
   (PF2) through the strong electrostatic interaction. Finally, a
   monolithic integration of aligned arrays of DNA-templated PF2 nanowires
   to yield two DNA/PF2-based devices is demonstrated. It is envisioned
   that this strategy can be readily extended to pattern other biomolecules
   and may render a broad range of potential applications from the
   nucleotide sequence and hybridization as recognition events to
   transducing elements in chemical sensors.}},

   urbanizing areas in Malawi adopt to address the limitations of pit
   latrines, the most common method of disposing human excreta. A
   particular challenge is lack of space for constructing new latrines as
   population density increases: traditional practice has been to cap full
   pits and simply move to a new site, but increasing demands on space
   require new approaches to extend the service life of latrines. In this
   context, we collected data on sanitation technology choices from January
   to September 2013 through 48 in-depth interviews and a stated preference
   survey targeting 1,300 property owners from 27 low-income urban areas.
   Results showed that property owners with concern about space for
   replacing pit latrines were 1.8 times more likely to select pit emptying
   service over the construction of new pit latrines with a slab floor (p =
   0.02) but there was no significant association between concern about
   space for replacing pit latrines and intention to adopt locally
   promoted, novel sanitation technology known as ecological sanitation
   (ecosan). Property owners preferred to adapt existing, known technology
   by constructing replacement pit latrines on old pit latrine locations,
   reducing the frequency of replacing pit latrines, or via emptying pit
   latrines when full. This study highlights potential challenges to
   adoption of wholly new sanitation technologies, even when they present
   clear advantages to end users. To scale, alternative sanitation
   technologies for rapidly urbanising cities should offer clear
   advantages, be affordable, be easy to use when shared among multiple
   households, and their design should be informed by existing adaptation
   strategies and local knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{The biocatalytic synthesis of phenothiazones and related compounds has
   been achieved in an aqueous system under mild conditions facilitated by
   laccase oxidation. It was found that by coupling 2-aminothiophenol
   directly with 1,4-quinones, the product yields could be significantly
   increased compared to generating the 1,4-quinones in situ from the
   corresponding hydroquinones via laccase oxidation. However, laccase
   still proved to be pivotal for achieving highest product yields by
   catalyzing the final oxidation step. Furthermore, a difference in
   reactivity of aromatic and aliphatic amines toward 1,4-naphthoquinone is
   observed. This study provides a sustainable approach to the synthesis of
   a biologically important class of compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluated computational efficiency of finite element
   (FE) simulations when a numerical approximation method was used to
   obtain the tangent moduli. A fiber-reinforced hyperelastic material
   model for nearly incompressible soft tissues was implemented for 3D
   solid elements using both the approximation method and the closed-form
   analytical method, and validated by comparing the components of the
   tangent modulus tensor (also referred to as the material Jacobian)
   between the two methods. The computational efficiency of the
   approximation method was evaluated with different perturbation
   parameters and approximation schemes, and quantified by the number of
   iteration steps and CPU time required to complete these simulations.
   From the simulation results, it can be seen that the overall accuracy of
   the approximation method is improved by adopting the central difference
   approximation scheme compared to the forward Euler approximation scheme.
   For small-scale simulations with about 10,000 DOFs, the approximation
   schemes could reduce the CPU time substantially compared to the
   closed-form solution, due to the fact that fewer calculation steps are
   needed at each integration point. However, for a large-scale simulation
   with about 300,000 DOFs, the advantages of the approximation schemes
   diminish because the factorization of the stiffness matrix will dominate
   the solution time. Overall, as it is material model independent, the
   approximation method simplifies the FE implementation of a complex
   constitutive model with comparable accuracy and computational efficiency
   to the closed-form solution, which makes it attractive in FE simulations
   with complex material models.}},

Title = {{Calcium Dynamics of Ex Vivo Long-Term Cultured CD8(+) T Cells Are
   Regulated by Changes in Redox Metabolism}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{T cells reach a state of replicative senescence characterized by a
   decreased ability to proliferate and respond to foreign antigens.
   Calcium release associated with TCR engagement is widely used as a
   surrogate measure of T cell response. Using an ex vivo culture model
   that partially replicates features of organismal aging, we observe that
   while the amplitude of Ca2+ signaling does not change with time in
   culture, older T cells exhibit faster Ca2+ rise and a faster decay. Gene
   expression analysis of Ca2+ channels and pumps expressed in T cells by
   RT-qPCR identified overexpression of the plasma membrane CRAC channel
   subunit ORAI1 and PMCA in older T cells. To test whether overexpression
   of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel is sufficient to explain the kinetic
   information, we adapted a previously published computational model by
   Maurya and Subramaniam to include additional details on the
   store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) process to recapitulate Ca2+
   dynamics after T cell receptor stimulation. Simulations demonstrated
   that upregulation of ORAI1 and PMCA channels is not sufficient to
   explain the observed alterations in Ca2+ signaling. Instead, modeling
   analysis identified kinetic parameters associated with the IP3R and
   STIM1 channels as potential causes for alterations in Ca2+ dynamics
   associated with the long term ex vivo culturing protocol. Due to these
   proteins having known cysteine residues susceptible to oxidation, we
   subsequently investigated and observed transcriptional remodeling of
   metabolic enzymes, a shift to more oxidized redox couples, and
   post-translational thiol oxidation of STIM1. The model-directed findings
   from this study highlight changes in the cellular redox environment that
   may ultimately lead to altered T cell calcium dynamics during
   immunosenescence or organismal aging.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleation and propagation of dislocations and its consequence on
   the defect structure in silicon during nanometric cutting are not well

   new mechanism of crystal plasticity identified by a fully automated
   dislocation extraction algorithm in molecular dynamics simulations of
   nanometric cutting of silicon for different cutting planes/directions at
   a wide range of temperatures (300-1500 K). Alongside amorphization of
   silicon, our simulations revealed nanoscale stochastic nucleation of
   dislocations and stacking faults, which serve as mediators of
   microscopic plasticity during various contact loading operations and
   manufacturing processes of silicon. Of interest is that, irrespective of
   the cutting temperature, the stacking faults, which were not formed for
   either the (010){[}(1) over bar 00] or (in Viol crystal setups, were
   generated with three atomic layers in the (110){[}00 (1) over bar]

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Optimal steady-state dispatch of a stand-alone hybrid power system
   determines a fuel-minimizing distribution strategy while meeting a
   forecasted demand over six months to a year. Corresponding optimization
   models that integrate hybrid technologies such as batteries, diesel
   generators, and photovoltaics with system interoperability requirements
   are often large, nonconvex, nonlinear, mixed integer programming
   problems that are difficult to solve even using the most
   state-of-the-art algorithms. The rate-capacity effect of a battery
   causes capacity to vary nonlinearly with discharge current; omitting
   this effect simplifies the model, but leads to over-estimation of
   discharge capabilities. We present a physics-based set of integer-linear
   constraints to model batteries in a hybrid system for a steady-state
   dispatch optimization problem that minimizes fuel use. Starting with a
   nonlinear set of constraints, we empirically derive linearizations and
   then compare them to a commonly used set of constraints that assumes a
   constant voltage and neglects rate-capacity. Numerical results
   demonstrate that assuming a fixed voltage and capacity may lead to
   over-estimating discharge quantities by up to 16\% compared to our
   overestimations of less than 1\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effect of jet velocity in co-flow water cavitation jet peening}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{360}},
Pages = {{38-50}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Water cavitation jet peening (WCP) uses cavitation caused by the shear
   layer created by two concentric co-flowing jets with large velocity
   difference to introduce compressive residual stresses in the surface
   layers of metal components subjected to fatigue loading or a corrosive
   environment. Mass loss and surface alteration in WCP have been shown to
   be minimal compared to other mechanical surface enhancement techniques,
   such as shot peening (SP). This paper investigates the effect of
   concentric jet velocities in cavitation jet peening in a co-flow
   configuration on cavitation intensity and peening performance, which are
   characterized by accelerated erosion on Al 1100-O and Al 7075-T6 and a
   strip curvature test on Al 7075-T6. Accelerated erosion tests reveal
   that cavitation intensity and associated erosion (measured by mass loss)
   are greatly affected by the combination of the inner (V-in) and outer
   (V-out) jet velocities and the normalized standoff distance (s(n)). Two
   characteristic erosion patterns are found depending on the relative
   magnitudes of the jet velocities: one that is focused at the jet center
   (termed center regime) and another that is concentrated in the
   surrounding annular region (termed ring regime). Erosion tests on Al
   1100-0 and Al 7075-T6 give unexpectedly different results in terms of
   the maximum mass loss as a function of the jet velocities and standoff
   distance. When compared to strip curvature tests, it is found that the
   accelerated erosion tests on Al 1100-0 do not capture the influence of
   inner jet velocity V-in and imply misleading trends with regard to outer
   flow velocity V-out. Erosion and curvature tests on Al 7075-T6 are found
   to be in good agreement and therefore are believed to be better suited
   to identify the optimum process conditions in WCP. Notwithstanding the
   higher mass loss density values observed in the center regime, the
   resultant strip curvature is found to be higher in the ring regime for a
   higher inner jet velocity V-in potentially leading to higher and deeper
   compressive residual stresses. (C) 2016 Elseviet B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{323}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Porous metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have attracted
   much attention because their potential to dramatically reduce the cost
   while enhancing the robustness and manufacturability. In particular, 430
   ferritic steel (430L) is one of the popular choice for SOFC support
   because of its superior performance and low cost. In this study, we
   investigate the oxidation and diffusion behavior of the interface
   between a Ni-based anode and porous 430L support exposed to a humidified
   (3\% H2O) hydrogen atmosphere at 700 degrees C. The Ni-GDC
   (Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta) cermet anodes are deposited on the porous 430L
   support by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The effect of exposure
   time on the microstructure and phase structure of the anode and the
   supports is studied and the element diffusion across the support/anode
   interface is characterized. Results indicate that the main oxidation
   product of the 430L support is Cr2O3, and that Cr and Fe will diffuse to
   the anode and the diffusion thickness increases with the exposure time.
   The diffusion thickness of Cr and Fe reach about 5 and 2 gm,
   respectively, after 1000 h exposure. However, the element diffusion and
   oxidation has little influence on the area-specific resistance,
   indicating that the porous 430L steel and plasma sprayed Ni-GDC anode
   are promising for durable SOFCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding the thermodynamic stability and redox properties of oxygen
   functional groups on graphene is critical to systematically design
   stable graphene-based positive electrode materials with high potential
   for lithium-ion battery applications. In this work, we study the
   thermodynamic and redox properties of graphene functionalized with
   carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, and the evolution of these properties with
   the number, types and distribution of functional groups by employing the
   density functional theory method. It is found that the redox potential
   of the functionalized graphene is sensitive to the types, number, and
   distribution of oxygen functional groups. First, the carbonyl group
   induces higher redox potential than the hydroxyl group. Second, more
   carbonyl groups would result in higher redox potential. Lastly, the
   locally concentrated distribution of the carbonyl group is more
   beneficial to have higher redox potential compared to the uniformly
   dispersed distribution. In contrast, the distribution of the hydroxyl
   group does not affect the redox potential significantly. Thermodynamic
   investigation demonstrates that the incorporation of carbonyl groups at
   the edge of graphene is a promising strategy for designing
   thermodynamically stable positive electrode materials with high redox
   potentials.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the removal of red blood cells in Macaca mulatta during a
   Plasmodium coatneyi infection}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria is the most deadly parasitic disease in humans
   globally, and the long-time coexistence with malaria has left indelible
   marks in the human genome that are the causes of a variety of genetic
   disorders. Although anaemia is a common clinical complication of
   malaria, the root causes and mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of
   malarial anaemia are unclear and difficult to study in humans. Non-human
   primate (NHP) model systems enable the mechanistic study and
   quantification of underlying causative factors of malarial anaemia, and
   particularly the onset of severe anaemia.
   Methods: Data were obtained in the course of Plasmodium coatneyi
   infections of malaria-naive and semi-immune rhesus macaques (Macaca
   mulatta), whose red blood cells (RBCs) were labelled in situ with biotin
   at the time the infections were initiated. The data were used for a
   survival analysis that permitted, for the first time, an accurate
   estimation of the lifespan of erythrocytes in macaques. The data
   furthermore formed the basis for the development and parameterization of
   a recursive dynamic model of erythrocyte turnover, which was used for
   the quantification of RBC production and removal in each macaque.
   Results: The computational analysis demonstrated that the lifespan of
   erythrocytes in macaques is 98 +/- 21 days. The model also unambiguously
   showed that death due to senescence and parasitaemia is not sufficient
   to account for the extent of infection-induced anaemia. Specifically,
   the model permits, for the first time, the quantification of the
   different causes of RBC death, namely, normal senescence,
   age-independent random loss, parasitization, and bystander effects in
   uninfected cells. Such a dissection of the overall RBC removal process
   is hardly possible with experimental means alone. In the infected
   malaria-naive macaques, death of erythrocytes by normal physiological
   senescence processes accounts for 20 \% and parasitization for only 4
   \%, whereas bystander effects are associated with an astonishing 76 \%
   of total RBC losses. Model-based comparisons of alternative mechanisms
   involved in the bystander effect revealed that most of the losses are
   likely due to a process of removing uninfected RBCs of all age classes
   and only minimally due to an increased rate of senescence of the
   uninfected RBCs.
   Conclusions: A new malaria blood-stage model was developed for the
   analysis of data characterizing P. coatneyi infections of M. mulatta.
   The model used a discrete and recursive framework with age-structure
   that allowed the quantification of the most significant
   pathophysiological processes of RBC removal. The computational results
   revealed that the malarial anaemia caused by this parasite is mostly due
   to a loss of uninfected RBCs by an age-independent process. The
   biological identity and complete mechanism of this process is not fully
   understood and requires further investigation.}},

Title = {{The Rationality of Four Metrics of Network Robustness: A Viewpoint of
   Robust Growth of Generalized Meshes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{There are quite a number of different metrics of network robustness.
   This paper addresses the rationality of four metrics of network
   robustness (the algebraic connectivity, the effective resistance, the
   average edge betweenness, and the efficiency) by investigating the
   robust growth of generalized meshes (GMs). First, a heuristic growth
   algorithm (the Proximity-Growth algorithm) is proposed. The resulting
   proximity-optimal GMs are intuitively robust and hence are adopted as
   the benchmark. Then, a generalized mesh (GM) is grown up by stepwise
   optimizing a given measure of network robustness. The following findings
   are presented: (1) The algebraic connectivity-optimal GMs deviate
   quickly from the proximity-optimal GMs, yielding a number of less robust
   GMs. This hints that the rationality of the algebraic connectivity as a
   measure of network robustness is still in doubt. (2) The effective
   resistace-optimal GMs and the average edge betweenness-optimal GMs are
   in line with the proximity-optimal GMs. This partly justifies the two
   quantities as metrics of network robustness. (3) The efficiency-optimal
   GMs deviate gradually from the proximity-optimal GMs, yielding some less
   robust GMs. This suggests the limited utility of the efficiency as a
   measure of network robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Fullerenes are ubiquitous as electron-acceptor and electron-transport
   materials in organic solar cells. Recent synthetic strategies to improve
   the solubility and electronic characteristics of these molecules have
   translated into a tremendous increase in the variety of derivatives
   employed in these applications. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations to examine the impact of going from monoadducts to bis- and
   tris-adducts on the structural, cohesive, and packing characteristics of
   {[}6,6]-phenyl-C-60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and indene-C-60.
   The packing configurations obtained at the MD level then serve as input
   for density functional theory calculations that examine the solid-state
   energetic disorder (distribution of site energies) as a function of
   chemical substitution. The variations in structural and site-energy
   disorders reflect the fundamental materials differences among the
   derivatives and impact the performance of these materials in thin-film
   electronic devices.}},

Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Bacteria of the SAR11 clade constitute up to one half of all microbial
   cells in the oxygen-rich surface ocean. SAR11 bacteria are also abundant
   in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), where oxygen falls below detection and
   anaerobic microbes have vital roles in converting bioavailable nitrogen
   to N-2 gas. Anaerobic metabolism has not yet been observed in SAR11, and
   it remains unknown how these bacteria contribute to OMZ biogeochemical
   cycling. Here, genomic analysis of single cells from the world's largest
   OMZ revealed previously uncharacterized SAR11 lineages with adaptations
   for life without oxygen, including genes for respiratory nitrate
   reductases (Nar). SAR11 nar genes were experimentally verified to encode
   proteins catalysing the nitrite-producing first step of denitrification
   and constituted similar to 40\% of OMZ nar transcripts, with
   transcription peaking in the anoxic zone of maximum nitrate reduction
   activity. These results link SAR11 to pathways of ocean nitrogen loss,
   redefining the ecological niche of Earth's most abundant organismal
   group.}},

Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{30}},
Pages = {{4077-4085}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Nanocomposites (denoted RGO/ZnONRA) comprising reduced graphene oxide
   (RGO) draped over the surface of zinc oxide nanorod array (ZnONRA) were
   produced via a simple low-temperature route, dispensing with the need
   for hydrothermal growth, electrochemical deposition or other complex
   treatments. The amount of deposited RGO can be readily tuned by
   controlling the concentration of graphene oxide (GO). Interestingly, the
   addition of Sn2+ not only enables the reduction of GO, but also
   functions as a bridge that connects the resulting RGO and ZnONRA.
   Remarkably, the incorporation of RGO improves the visible-light
   absorption and reduces the bandgap of ZnO, thereby leading to the
   markedly improved visible-light photocatalytic performance. Moreover,
   RGO/ZnONRA nanocomposites exhibit a superior stability as a result of
   the surface protection of ZnONRA by RGO. The mechanism on the improved
   photocatalytic performance based on the cophotosensitizations under the
   visible-light irradiation has been proposed. This simple yet effective
   route to the RGO-decorated semiconductor nanocomposites renders the
   better visible-light utilization, which may offer great potential for
   use in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, solar cells,
   and optoelectronic materials and devices.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new class of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) open cell
   PU-PE foams produced by blocking the shape memory effect in the polymer.
   Contrary to classical NPR open cell thermoset and thermoplastic foams
   that return to their auxetic phase after reheating (and therefore limit
   their use in technological applications), this new class of cellular
   solids has a permanent negative Poisson's ratio behavior, generated
   through multiple shape memory (mSM) treatments that lead to a fixity of
   the topology of the cell foam. The mSM-NPR foams have Poisson's ratio
   values similar to the auxetic foams prior their return to the
   conventional phase, but compressive stress strain curves similar to the
   ones of conventional foams. The results show that by manipulating the
   shape memory effect in polymer microstructures it is possible to obtain
   new classes of materials with unusual deformation mechanisms.}},

   low transmission is predicted throughout the pseudogap, as is observed

Abstract = {{The influence of star-like architecture on phase behavior of star -like
   block copolymer under cylindrical confinement differs largely from the
   bulk (i.e., nonconfinement). A set of intriguing self-assembled
   morphologies and the corresponding phase diagrams of star-like (AB)(f)
   diblock copolymers with different numbers of arms f (i.e., f = 3, 9, 15,
   and 21) in four scenarios (phi(A) = 0.3 and V-0 > 0; phi(A) = 0.3 and
   V-0 < 0; phi(A) = 0.7 and V-0 > 0; and phi(A), = 0.7 and V-0 < 0 (where
   phi(A) is the volume fraction of A block) and V-0 < 0 and V-0 > 0
   represent that the pore wall of cylindrical confinement prefers the
   inner A block (i.e., A-preferential) and B block (i.e., B-preferential),
   respectively) were for the first time scrutinized by employing the
   pseudospectral method of self-consistent mean -field theory.
   Surprisingly, a new nanoscopic phase, that is,
   perforated-lamellae-on-cylinder (denoted PC), was observed in star -like
   (AB), diblock copolymer at ik = 0.3 and V-0 > 0. With a further increase
   in f, a single lamellae (denoted L1) was found to possess a larger phase
   region. Under the confinement of A -preferential wall (i.e., V-0 < 0) at
   phi(A) = 0.3, PC phase became metastable and its free energy increased
   as f increased. Quite intriguingly, when phi(A) = 0.7 and V0 > 0, where
   an inverted cylinder was formed in bulk, the PC phase became stable, and
   its free energy decreased as f increased, suggesting the propensity to
   form PC phase under this condition. Moreover, in stark contrast to the
   phase transition of C-1 L-1 -> PC (C-1, a single cylindrical microdmain)
   at OA = 0.3 and 170 > 0, when subjected to the A-preferential wall
   (phi(A) = 0.7), a different phase transition sequence (i.e., C-1 -> PC
   -> L1) was identified due to the formation of a double-layer structure.
   On the basis of our calculations, the influence of star-like
   architecture on (AB)/ diblock copolymer under the imposed cylindrical
   confinement, particularly the shift of the phase boundaries as a
   function off was thoroughly understood. These self-assembled
   nanostructures may hold the promise for applications as lithographic
   templates for nanowires, photonic crystals, and nanotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{Covalent adaptable networks (CANs; also known as dynamic covalent
   networks or vitrimers) are appealing for developing simple and efficient
   techniques for recycling thermosetting polymers. In this paper, ethylene
   glycol (EG) is used as a solvent to enable pressure-free surface
   welding, surface repair, and recycling of a malleable epoxy where the
   transesterification-type bond exchange reaction (BER) imparts a dynamic
   nature to the covalent network. At a high temperature, the EG molecules
   participate in the BER, leading to dissolution of the epoxy network. If
   the EG is allowed to evaporate, the dissolved epoxy can re-form into a
   solid. The effects of EG content, temperature, and catalyst
   concentration on EG-assisted BERs are investigated. It is found that the
   amount of EG can be adjusted to tune the solution/solid transformation:
   An excessive amount of EG is required to dissolve the epoxy; on the
   other hand, a shortage of EG can shift the reaction back to re-form the
   polymer. Furthermore, the catalyst concentration defines the point at
   which dissolution initiates, while the degradation rate depends on
   temperature. This new EGassisted method is further used for surface
   welding, surface damage repair, and powder-based reprocessing. The
   EG-assisted method does not require pressure and can achieve the
   properties of a fresh sample. It also provides potential opportunities
   to develop facile recycling techniques for thermosetting polymers.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{We present a new 4D printing approach that can create high resolution
   (up to a few microns), multimaterial shape memory polymer (SMP)
   architectures. The approach is based on high resolution projection
   microstereolithography (P mu SL) and uses a family of photo-curable
   methacrylate based copolymer networks. We designed the constituents and
   compositions to exhibit desired thermomechanical behavior (including
   rubbery modulus, glass transition temperature and failure strain which
   is more than 300\% and larger than any existing printable materials) to
   enable controlled shape memory behavior. We used a high resolution, high
   contrast digital micro display to ensure high resolution of photo-curing
   methacrylate based SMPs that requires higher exposure energy than more
   common acrylate based polymers. An automated material exchange process
   enables the manufacture of 3D composite architectures from multiple
   photo-curable SMPs. In order to understand the behavior of the 3D
   composite microarchitectures, we carry out high fidelity computational
   simulations of their complex nonlinear, time-dependent behavior and
   study important design considerations including local deformation, shape
   fixity and free recovery rate. Simulations are in good agreement with
   experiments for a series of single and multimaterial components and can
   be used to facilitate the design of SMP 3D structures.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the enhancement of structure-borne elastic wave energy
   harvesting, both numerically and experimentally, by exploiting a
   Gradient-Index Phononic Crystal Lens (GRIN-PCL) structure. The proposed
   GRIN-PCL is formed by an array of blind holes with different diameters
   on an aluminum plate, where the blind hole distribution is tailored to
   obtain a hyperbolic secant gradient profile of refractive index guided
   by finite-element simulations of the lowest asymmetric mode Lamb wave
   band diagrams. Under plane wave excitation from a line source,
   experimentally measured wave field validates the numerical simulation of
   wave focusing within the GRIN-PCL domain. A piezoelectric energy
   harvester disk located at the first focus of the GRIN-PCL yields an
   order of magnitude larger power output as compared to the baseline case
   of energy harvesting without the GRIN-PCL on the uniform plate

Title = {{Valve Type, Size, and Deployment Location Affect Hemodynamics in an In

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to optimize hemodynamic
   performance of valve-in-valve (VIV) according to transcatheter heart
   valve (THV) type (balloon vs. self-expandable), size, and deployment
   positions in an in vitro model.
   BACKGROUND VIV transcatheter aortic valve replacement is increasingly
   used for the treatment of patients with a failing surgical
   bioprosthesis. However, there is a paucity in understanding the THV
   hemodynamic performance in this setting.
   METHODS VIV transcatheter aortic valve replacement was simulated in a
   physiologic left heart simulator by deploying a 23-mm SAPIEN, 23-mm
   CoreValve, and 26-mm CoreValve within a 23-mm Edwards PERIMOUNT surgical
   bioprosthesis. Each THV was deployed into 5 different positions: normal
   (inflow of THV was juxtaposed with inflow of surgical bioprosthesis), -3
   and -6 mm subannular, and +3 and +6 mm supra-annular. At a heart rate of
   70 bpm and cardiac output of 5.0 l/min, mean transvalvular pressure
   gradients (TVPG), regurgitant fraction (RF), effective orifice area,
   pinwheeling index, and pullout forces were evaluated and compared
   between THVs.
   RESULTS Although all THV deployments resulted in hemodynamics that would
   have been consistent with Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 procedure
   success, we found significant differences between THV type, size, and
   deployment position. For a SAPIEN valve, hemodynamic performance
   improved with a supra-annular deployment, with the best performance
   observed at +6 mm. Compared with a normal position, +6 mm resulted in
   lower TVPG (9.31 +/- 0.22 mm Hg vs. 11.66 +/- 0.22 mm Hg; p < 0.01), RF
   (0.95 +/- 0.60\% vs. 1.27 +/- 0.66\%; p < 0.01), and PI (1.23 +/- 0.22\%
   vs. 3.46 +/- 0.18\%; p < 0.01), and higher effective orifice area (1.51
   +/- 0.08 cm(2) vs. 1.35 +/- 0.02 cm(2); p < 0.01) at the cost of lower
   pullout forces (5.54 +/- 0.20 N vs. 7.09 +/- 0.49 N; p < 0.01). For both
   CoreValve sizes, optimal deployment was observed at the normal position.
   The 26-mm CoreValve, when compared with the 23-mm CoreValve and 23-mm
   SAPIEN, had a lower TVPG (7.76 +/- 0.14 mm Hg vs. 10.27 +/- 0.18 mm Hg
   vs. 9.31 +/- 0.22 mm Hg; p < 0.01) and higher effective orifice area
   (1.66 +/- 0.05 cm(2) vs. 1.44 +/- 0.05 cm(2) vs. 1.51 +/- 0.08 cm(2); p
   < 0.01), RF (4.79 +/- 0.67\% vs. 1.98 +/- 0.36\% vs. 0.95 +/- 1.68\%; p
   < 0.01), PI (29.13 +/- 0.22\% vs. 6.57 +/- 0.14\% vs. 1.23 +/- 0.22\%; p
   < 0.01), and pullout forces (10.65 +/- 0.66 N vs. 5.35 +/- 0.18 N vs.
   5.54 +/- 0.20 N; p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS The optimal deployment location for VIV in a 23 PERIMOUNT
   surgical bioprosthesis was at a +6 mm supra-annular position for a 23-mm
   SAPIEN valve and at the normal position for both the 23-mm and 26-mm
   CoreValves. The 26-mm CoreValve had lower gradients, but higher RF and
   PI than the 23-mm CoreValve and the 23-mm SAPIEN. In their optimal
   positions, all valves resulted in hemodynamics consistent with the
   definitions of Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 procedural success.
   Long-term studies are needed to understand the clinical impact of these
   hemodynamic performance differences in patients who undergo VIV
   transcatheter aortic valve replacement. (C) 2016 by the American College

Abstract = {{The IceCube neutrino telescope at the South Pole has measured the
   atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum as a function of zenith angle and
   energy in the approximate 320 GeV to 20 TeV range, to search for the
   oscillation signatures of light sterile neutrinos. No evidence for
   anomalous nu(mu) or (nu) over bar (mu) disappearance is observed in
   either of two independently developed analyses, each using one year of
   atmospheric neutrino data. New exclusion limits are placed on the
   parameter space of the 3 + 1 model, in which muon antineutrinos
   experience a strong Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein-resonant oscillation.
   The exclusion limits extend to sin(2)2 theta(24) <= 0.02 at Delta m(2)
   similar to 0.3 eV(2) at the 90\% confidence level. The allowed region
   from global analysis of appearance experiments, including LSND and
   MiniBooNE, is excluded at approximately the 99\% confidence level for
   the global best-fit value of vertical bar U-e4 vertical bar(2).}},

Abstract = {{Inverted base pavements are flexible pavement structures built by
   placing a top quality compacted granular aggregate base between a rigid
   cement-treated base and a thin-asphalt surface layer. The proximity of
   the granular base to the load makes its behaviour critical to the
   pavement response. Three-dimensional finite-element simulations are
   conducted to assess the mechanical performance of different inverted
   base pavement structures, with emphasis placed on pavements that feature
   thin-asphalt surface layers. A nonlinear constitutive model captures the
   anisotropic stress-dependent stiffness of the granular base. Results
   show that the stress distribution within inverted base pavements is
   markedly different from that of conventional pavements due to the
   stiffness contrast between successive layers. Thin-asphalt layers deform
   more uniformly and experience lower tension than thick layers. However,
   in the presence of combined shear and vertical contact loads, the
   benefits of a membrane response in thin asphalt concrete layers may be
   overwhelmed by the increased tensile strain at the load edge. The
   transition from beam to membrane asphalt response depends on the
   relative stiffness between the asphalt layer and the aggregate base. In
   most cases, the transition takes place at an asphalt layer thickness
   between 25mm and 50mm.}},

Abstract = {{A facile, environmentally-friendly, low-cost, and scalable deposition
   process has been developed and automated to apply polyelectrolyte
   multilayers (PEMs) on flexible Kapton HN substrates. Two weak
   polyelectrolytes, poly(acrylic acid) and polyethylenimine, were
   deposited in an alternating, layer-by-layer fashion under controlled pH
   and ionic strength. Compared to strong polyelectrolytes, weak
   electrolytes can control the properties of the PEMs more systmatically
   and simply. To our knowledge, this work on surface modification of
   Kapton is not only the first to use only weak polyelectrolytes, but is
   also the first to take advantage of the surface properties of
   calcium-bearing additive particles present in Kapton HN. The resulting
   surface-modified Kapton HN substrate allowed for the inkjet printing of
   water-based graphene oxide (GO) inks and organic solvent-based inks with
   good adhesion and with desired printability. While the deposition of a
   single PEM layer on a Kapton substrate significantly reduced the water
   contact angle and allowed for the inkjet-printing of GO inks, the
   deposition of additional PEM layers was required to maintain the
   adhesion during post-printing chemical treatments. As a conceptual
   demonstration of the general applicability of this PEM surface
   modification approach, a flexible, robust, single-layered gas sensor
   prototype was fully inkjet printed with both water- and ethanol-based
   inks and tested for its sensitivity to diethyl ethylphosphonate (DEEP),
   a simulant for G-series nerve agents. The electrical conductivity and
   morphology of the sensor were found to be insensitive to repeated
   bending around a 1 cm radius.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a two-dimensional, axisymmetric channel with porous
   inserts attached to the walls is analyzed from the perspective of the
   first and second laws of thermodynamics. In this analysis, the flow is
   assumed to be fully developed with a constant heat flux imposed on the
   external surfaces of the walls, while heat could be internally generated
   by the fluid and solid phases. Using a Darcy-Brinkman model of momentum
   transport along with a two-equation thermal energy model, a convective
   model was developed to describe the thermal boundary conditions on the
   porous-fluid interface. The so-called Model A was employed on the walls
   of the channel and semi-analytical solutions were developed for the
   hydrodynamic, temperature, entropy generation fields and the Nusselt
   number, and an extensive parametric study was subsequently, conducted.
   The results indicated that the inclusion of exothermicity leads to
   significant modifications in the thermal and entropic behaviour of the
   system. In particular, through comparison with the recent literature, it
   was demonstrated that exothermicity can significantly impact the
   influence of the porous-fluid interface model upon the generation of
   both the local and total entropy within the system. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Efficient generation of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells
   is critical for their regenerative applications. Microgravity and 3D
   culture can profoundly modulate cell proliferation and survival. Here,
   we engineered microscale progenitor cardiac spheres from human
   pluripotent stem cells and exposed the spheres to simulated microgravity
   using a random positioning machine for 3 days during their
   differentiation to cardiomyocytes. This process resulted in the
   production of highly enriched cardiomyocytes (99\% purity) with high
   viability (90\%) and expected functional properties, with a 1.5 to
   4-fold higher yield of cardiomyocytes from each undifferentiated stem
   cell as compared with 3D-standard gravity culture. Increased induction,
   proliferation and viability of cardiac progenitors as well as
   up-regulation of genes associated with proliferation and survival at the
   early stage of differentiation were observed in the 3D culture under
   simulated microgravity. Therefore, a combination of 3D culture and
   simulated microgravity can be used to efficiently generate highly
   enriched cardiomyocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of electromagnetic generators (EMGs) and triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs) can increase the total energy conversion
   efficiency from one mechanical motion by connecting the two devices in
   parallel after using power management circuits. A critical issue is how
   to realize the integration of the EMG and TENG in the same current
   circuits. Here, a hybridized nanogenerator, including an EMG and a TENG
   with the same set of electrodes, has been utilized to simultaneously
   scavenge mechanical energy. The hybridized nanogenerator can deliver a
   high output current of about 3.8 mA and `a high output voltage of about
   245 V when the switch in the device circuit was turned on and off,
   respectively. A acceleration sensor can be achieved by using the
   hybridized nanogenerator, where the detection sensitivities are about
   143.2 V/(m/s(2)) for TENG and 291.7 mu A/(m/s(2)) for EMG. The
   fabricated hybridized nanogenerator may have practical use for
   scavenging mechanical energy and self-powered acceleration sensor
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo-like gallium nitride (GaN) microwires are synthesized via
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to fabricate piezotronic memristors.
   Defect boundary areas (DBAs) near the bamboo knots produce apparent
   switching between high and low resistance states upon sweeping of the
   magnitudes of the biased voltages across the GaN microwire-based devices
   at room temperature. Furthermore, by coupling the piezoelectric and
   semiconducting properties in the GaN microwire, the piezotronic effect
   is introduced to effectively modulate the SET voltages via
   strain-induced piezoelectric polarizations created at the DBA interface
   upon mechanical deformation. The experimental results indicate that the
   device remembered the most recent resistance states when the power is
   turned off, and the waveform is tunable because of the delayed switching
   effect. This work provides an alternative approach to the design and
   modification of memristors based on nanostructured piezoelectric
   semiconductors using the piezotronic effect.}},

Title = {{Joint training of DNNs by incorporating an explicit dereverberation
   structure for distant speech recognition}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{We explore joint training strategies of DNNs for simultaneous
   dereverberation and acoustic modeling to improve the performance of
   distant speech recognition. There are two key contributions. First, a
   new DNN structure incorporating both dereverberated and original
   reverberant features is shown to effectively improve recognition
   accuracy over the conventional one using only dereverberated features as
   the input. Second, in most of the simulated reverberant environments for
   training data collection and DNN-based dereverberation, the resource
   data and learning targets are high-quality clean speech. With our joint
   training strategy, we can relax this constraint by using large-scale
   diversified real close-talking data as the targets which are easy to be
   collected via many speech-enabled applications from mobile internet
   users, and find the scenario even more effective. Our experiments on a
   Mandarin speech recognition task with 2000-h training data show that the
   proposed framework achieves relative word error rate reductions of 9.7
   and 8.6 \% over the multi-condition training systems for the cases of
   single-channel and multi-channel with beamforming, respectively.
   Furthermore, significant gains are consistently observed over the
   pre-processing approach using simply DNN-based dereverberation.}},

Title = {{Library based x-ray scatter correction for dedicated cone beam breast CT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4529-4544}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The image quality of dedicated cone beam breast CT (CBBCT) is
   limited by substantial scatter contamination, resulting in cupping
   artifacts and contrast-loss in reconstructed images. Such effects
   obscure the visibility of soft-tissue lesions and calcifications, which
   hinders breast cancer detection and diagnosis. In this work, we propose
   a library-based software approach to suppress scatter on CBBCT images
   with high efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.
   Methods: The authors precompute a scatter library on simplified breast
   models with different sizes using the GEANT4-based Monte Carlo (MC)
   toolkit. The breast is approximated as a semiellipsoid with homogeneous
   glandular / adipose tissue mixture. For scatter correction on real
   clinical data, the authors estimate the breast size from a first-pass
   breast CT reconstruction and then select the corresponding scatter
   distribution from the library. The selected scatter distribution from
   simplified breast models is spatially translated to match the projection
   data from the clinical scan and is subtracted from the measured
   projection for effective scatter correction. The method performance was
   evaluated using 15 sets of patient data, with a wide range of breast
   sizes representing about 95\% of general population. Spatial
   nonuniformity (SNU) and contrast to signal deviation ratio (CDR) were
   used as metrics for evaluation.
   Results: Since the time-consuming MC simulation for library generation
   is precomputed, the authors' method efficiently corrects for scatter
   with minimal processing time. Furthermore, the authors find that a
   scatter library on a simple breast model with only one input parameter,
   i. e., the breast diameter, sufficiently guarantees improvements in SNU
   and CDR. For the 15 clinical datasets, the authors' method reduces the
   average SNU from 7.14\% to 2.47\% in coronal views and from 10.14\% to
   3.02\% in sagittal views. On average, the CDR is improved by a factor of
   1.49 in coronal views and 2.12 in sagittal views.
   Conclusions: The library-based scatter correction does not require
   increase in radiation dose or hardware modifications, and it improves
   over the existing methods on implementation simplicity and computational
   efficiency. As demonstrated through patient studies, the authors'
   approach is effective ;and stable, and is therefore clinically
   attractive for CBBCT imaging. (C) 2016 American Association of

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) grafted with fluorescent and

   spectroscopy and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR).
   Differential scanning calorimetry measurements suggested that the lower
   critical solution temperature of PNIPAM-grafted CNCs is close 32 degrees
   C. During polymerization, tuned fluorescence signatures were obtained by
   varying the dye dosages. At room temperature, the release amount of the
   loaded 5-FU was about 42\% at a pH of 2.1, while this value approached
   60\% at a pH of 7.4. Both the cumulative release amount and the release
   rate were greatly increased when the temperature was raised to 37
   degrees C. The novel PNIPAM-grafted CNCs with both fluorescence and

   complicated angular dynamics; caused by effects of fluid inertia
   (characterized by the particle Reynolds number Re-p) and particle
   inertia (characterized by the Stokes number St). Understanding this
   behavior can provide important fundamental knowledge of suspension flows
   with spheroidal particles. Up to now only qualitative analysis has been
   available at moderate Re-p. Rigorous analytical methods apply only to
   very small Re-p and numerical results lack accuracy due to the
   difficulty in treating the moving boundary of the particle. Here we show
   that the dynamics of the rotational motion of a prolate spheroidal
   particle in a linear shear flow can be quantitatively analyzed through
   the eigenvalues of the log-rolling particle (particle aligned with
   vorticity). This analysis provides an accurate description of stable
   rotational states in terms of Re-p, St, and particle aspect ratio
   (r(p)). Furthermore we find that the effect on the orientational
   dynamics from fluid inertia can be modeled with a Duffing-Van der Pol
   oscillator. This opens up the possibility of developing a reduced-order
   model that takes into account effects from both fluid and particle
   inertia.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the performance of rechargeable lithium (Li)-sulfur (S)
   batteries is one of most popular topics in a battery field because of
   their low cost and high specific energy. However, S experiences
   dissolution during its electrochemical reactions; hence, maintaining its
   initial capacity is challenging. Protecting the S cathode with a Li ion
   conducting layer that acts as a barrier for polysulfide transport is an
   attractive strategy, but formation of such protective layers typically
   involves significant effort and cost. Here, we report a facile route to
   form a conformal solid electrolyte layer on S cathodes in situ using a
   carbonate solvent. The chemically and mechanically stable and Li ion
   conducting protective layer is formed by inducing electrolyte reduction
   and polymerization reactions on the cathode surface. The layer serves as
   a polysulfide's barrier, successfully helping to retain S active
   material in the carbon pores. In addition, it helps to improve the
   performance of Li anodes.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid devices employing organic semiconductors interfaced with an
   aqueous solution represent a new frontier in bioelectronics and energy
   applications. Understanding of the energetics and photoinduced processes
   occurring at the organic/water interface is fundamental for further
   progress. Here, we investigate the interfacial electronic structure of
   poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) sandwiched between an indium tin oxide
   (ITO) electrode and a liquid water electrolyte. The aqueous solution is
   found to polarize the polymer outermost layers, which together with the
   polymer p-(photo) doping by dissolved oxygen localizes photogenerated
   electrons at the P3HT/water interface, while holes can be transferred to
   the ITO electrode. Under illumination, the polymer/water interface is
   negatively charged, attracting positive ions from the electrolyte
   solution and perturbing the ion distribution in the aqueous solution.
   The observed mechanism is of general character and could underlie the
   behavior of a variety of devices characterized by an organic/water
   interface, such as prosthetic devices for artificial vision and
   organic-based systems for photoelectrochemical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new water treatment system that couples (photo-)
   electrochemical catalysis (PEC or EC) in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was
   configured using a stainless-steel (SS) cathode coated with Fe-o/ TiO2.
   We examined the destruction of methylene blue (MB) and tetracycline.
   Fe-o/TiO2 was prepared using a chemical reduction-deposition method and
   coated onto an SS wire mesh (500 mesh) using a sol technique. The anode
   generates electricity using microbes (bio-anode). Connected via wire and
   ohmic resistance, the system requires a short reaction time and operates
   at a low cost by effectively removing 94\% MB (initial concentration 20
   mg.L-1) and 83\% TOC/TOC0 under visible light illumination (50 W; 1.99
   mW.cm(-2) for 120 min, MFC-PEC). The removal was similar even without
   light irradiation (MFC-EC). The E-Eo of the MFC-PEC system was
   approximately 0.675 kWh.m(-3).order(-1), whereas that of the MFC-EC
   system was zero. The system was able to remove 70\% COD in tetracycline
   solution (initial tetracycline concentration 100 mg.L-1) after 120 min
   of visible light illumination; without light, the removal was 15\%
   lower. The destruction of MB and tetracycline in both traditional
   photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis systems was notably low. The
   electron spin-resonance spectroscopy (ESR) study demonstrated that
   center dot OH was formed under visible light, and center dot O-2(-) was
   formed without light. The bio-electricity-activated O-2 and ROS
   (reactive oxidizing species) generation by Fe-o/TiO2 effectively
   degraded the pollutants. This cathodic degradation improved the
   electricity generation by accepting and consuming more electrons from
   the bio-anode. (C) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin

Abstract = {{Like all health care delivery systems, the U.S. Department of Defense
   Military Health System (MHS) strives to achieve top preventative care
   and population health outcomes for its members while operating at an
   efficient level and containing costs. The objective of this study is to
   understand the overall efficiency performance of military hospitals and
   investigate the relationship between efficiency and wellness. This study
   uses data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis to
   compare the efficiency of 128 military treatment facilities from the
   Army, Navy, and Air Force during the period of 2011 to 2013. Fixed
   effects panel regression is used to determine the association between
   the hospital efficiency and wellness scores. The results indicate that
   data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis efficiency
   scores are congruent in direction. Both results indicate that the
   majority of the MHS hospitals and clinics can potentially improve their
   productive efficiency by managing their input resources better. When
   comparing the performance of the three military branches of service,
   Army hospitals as a group outperformed their Navy and Air Force
   counterparts; thus, best practices from the Army should be shared across
   service components. The findings also suggest no statistically
   significant, positive association between efficiency and wellness over
   time in the MHS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a system of practical technologies to implement an
   illumination-robust, consumer grade biometric system based on face
   recognition to be used in the automotive market. Most current face
   recognition systems are compromised in accuracy by ambient illumination
   changes. Outdoor applications including vehicle personalization pose an
   especially challenging environment for face recognition. The point of
   this research is to investigate practical face recognition used for
   identity management in order to minimize algorithmic complexity while
   making the system robust to ambient illumination changes. First, a frame
   differencing method is presented with an active near-infrared
   illumination control that produces images independent of the ambient
   illumination. Second, an end-to-end face recognition system is presented
   including foreground/background segmentation, motion detection, face
   detection, motion interpolation, pose clustering and face recognition
   modules. It is shown that the frame differencing method makes the
   modules more robust to the ambient illumination variation. Vehicular
   application videos were taken in extremely challenging outdoor
   illumination and shadowing conditions and used to test each module.
   Finally, extensive test results of vehicular scenario are provided to
   evaluate the end-to-end systems(1).}},

Journal = {{NPG ASIA MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Although a wide variety of three-dimensional porous electrode
   architectures have been created for supercapacitors to markedly enhance
   the charge and mass transfer associated with cycling, their low
   volumetric energy densities limit applications in many energy storage
   systems. In this work, we report a unique electrode architecture
   consisting of Ni3S2 nanosheet-onto-Ni3S2-nanorods grown on nickel foam
   and prepared using a simple one-step hydrothermal method. When tested as
   an electrode for a supercapacitor (using a three-electrode
   configuration), this material exhibited excellent rate capability and
   cycling stability at high cycling rates. The obtainable capacitance
   decreased by <42\% as the current density was increased from 20 to 240
   mA cm(-2), and the capacity retained 89.3\% of its initial value after
   5000 cycles at a cycling rate of 120 mA cm(-2). Further, an asymmetric
   supercapacitor consisting of the Ni3S2 nanosheet-onto-Ni3S2-nanorods
   electrode and an activated carbon (AC) electrode displayed a volumetric
   energy density as high as similar to 1.96 mWh cm(-3), with the potential
   to bridge the performance gap between thin-film Li batteries and
   commercial AC//AC supercapacitors. The outstanding electrochemical
   performance is attributed to the good mechanical adhesion and electrical
   connection with the substrate, high contact area with the electrolyte
   and alleviated structural pulverization during the ion
   insertion/desertion process. It is predicted that the architectural
   Ni3S2-nanosheet-on-nanorods array prepared with this facile method
   offers great potential promise in large-scale energy storage device
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, vertical sectorization (VS) has been proposed for
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission in long term
   evolution advanced (LTE-A) downlink systems. In this paper, we will
   investigate MIMO transmission with VS for LTE-A systems. We first divide
   each cell into two sectors in vertical direction so that more users can
   be co-scheduled and more refined beams can be formed in each sector. We
   then address how to jointly optimize two tilt angles, user scheduling,
   and resource block allocation for a practical LTE-A system, and provide
   an efficient VS-based MIMO scheduling algorithm with low-complexity. The
   performance improvement of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by
   system level simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate how met need for accessibility and availability
   of primary care among nonelderly individuals in Georgia will be affected
   by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) over the next 10
   years.
   Methods. We used a stock-and-flow model to predict the number of
   available visits from 2013 to 2025, regression models to project needed
   visits, and an optimization model to estimate met need. The outputs of
   these models were used to estimate unmet need and the availability and
   accessibility of primary care.
   Results. Our findings showed that the number of primary care providers
   will increase by 9.2\% to 11.7\% by 2025 and that the number of needed
   visits will increase by 20\%. Under Medicaid expansion, the percentage
   of met need will increase from 67\% to 80\%. Accessibility will improve
   by 20\% under expansion, and availability will decrease by 13\% to 19\%
   under expansion.
   Conclusions. The ACAs' provisions will reduce unmet need and positively
   affect accessibility while reducing availability in some communities.
   Increased need because of a larger Medicaid population under Medicaid
   expansion will not be a significant burden on the privately insured
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), positive bias temperature
   instability (PBTI), and hot carrier injection (HCI) are leading
   reliability concerns for modern microprocessors. In this paper, a
   framework is proposed to analyze the impact of BTI (NBTI and PBTI) and
   HCI on state-of-art microprocessors and to estimate microprocessor
   lifetimes due to each wearout mechanism. Our methodology finds the
   detailed electrical stress and the temperature of each device within a
   microprocessor system running a variety of standard benchmarks.
   Combining the electrical stress profiles, thermal profiles, and
   device-level models, we perform timing analysis on the critical paths of
   a microprocessor using our methodology to characterize the
   microprocessor performance degradation due to BTI and HCI and to
   estimate the lifetime distribution of logic blocks. In addition, we
   study dc noise margins in conventional 6T SRAM cells as a function of
   BTI and HCI degradation to estimate memory lifetime distributions. The
   lifetimes of memory blocks are then combined with the lifetimes of logic
   blocks to provide an estimate of the system lifetime distribution.}},

Title = {{A thermodynamic analysis of forced convection through porous media using
   pore scale modeling}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{303-316}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The flow thorough porous media is analyzed from a thermodynamic
   perspective, with a particular focus on the entropy generation inside
   the porous media, using a pore scale modeling approach. A single
   representative elementary volume was utilized to reduce the CPU time.
   Periodic boundary conditions were employed for the vertical boundaries,
   by re-injecting the velocity and temperature profiles from the outlet to
   the inlet and iterating. The entropy generation was determined for both
   circular and square cross-sectional configurations, and the effects of
   different Reynolds numbers, assuming Darcy and Forchheimer regimes, were
   also taken into account. Three porosities were evaluated and discussed
   for each cross-sectional configuration, and streamlines, isothermal
   lines and the local entropy generation rate contours were determined and
   compared. The local entropy generation rate contours indicated that the
   highest entropy generation regions were close to the inlet for low
   Reynolds flows and near the central cylinder for high Reynolds flows.
   Increasing Reynolds number from 100 to 200 reveals disturbances in the
   dimensionless volume averaged entropy generation rate trend that may be
   due to a change in the fluid flow regime. According to Bejan number
   evaluation for both cross-section configurations, it is demonstrated
   that is mainly provoked by the heat transfer irreversibility. A
   performance evaluation criterion parameter was calculated for different
   case-studies. By this parameter, conditions for obtaining the least
   entropy generation and the highest Nusselt number could be achieved
   simultaneously. Indeed, this parameter utilizes both the first and the
   second laws of thermodynamics to present the best case-study. According
   to the performance evaluation criterion, it is indicated that the square
   cross-section configuration with 0 = 0.64 exhibits better thermal
   performance for low Reynolds number flows. A comparison between the
   equal porosity cases for two different cross-sectional configurations
   indicated that the square crosssection demonstrated a higher performance
   evaluation criterion than the circular cross-section, for a variety of
   different Reynolds numbers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its extremely high capacity, silicon (Si) is a potentially very
   useful anode material for lithium (Li) ion batteries. The key aim in the
   application of Si-based nanostructures to Li ion battery anodes is to

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{We have successfully synthesized novel, nickel-based, pillared
   DABCO-MOFs (DMOFs) of similar topologies - {[}Ni(L)(DABCO)(0.5)], where
   L is the functionalized BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) linker and
   DABCO is 1,4-diazabicyclo{[}2.2.2]-octane. The stability of DMOF-ADC
   ({[}Ni(9,10-anthracenedicarboxylic acid)(DABCO)(0.5)]) and DMOF-TM
   ({[}Ni(2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid)(DABC0)05]) in a
   humid environment was confirmed by surface area analysis on the
   water-exposed samples. When used as electrode materials, these DMOF
   capacitors exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. For example,
   a Ni-DMOF-ADC electrode showed specific capacitances of 552 and 438 F
   g(-1) at current densities of 1 and 20 A g(-1), respectively, while
   maintaining outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of >
   98\% after 16,000 cycles at current density of 10 A g(-1)) for
   MOF-derived materials based supercapacitors. The excellent
   electrochemical performance is attributed to the conversion of DMOFs to
   highly functionalized nickel hydroxide which inherited the high
   stability of DMOF-ADC and remained intact during charge-discharge
   process. Further, this work provides a general approach for the
   application of nickel-based pillared MOFs as relatively stable electrode
   in electrical energy storage. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow nanofibers of PrBa0.5Sr0.5CO2O5+delta (PBSC), created by an
   electrospinning process, are assembled into a three dimensional (3D)
   fibrous porous electrode, providing facile pathways for gas transport
   and excellent electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and,
   thus, greatly enhancing the rate of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), as
   confirmed by the small electrode polarization resistance and low
   activation energy. A simple geometric modeling suggests that an
   electrode with longer fibers tends to be more efficient in facilitating
   mass and charge transfer under the conditions studied. A solid oxide
   fuel cell based on this 3D fibrous cathode demonstrates a peak power
   density of 1.11 W cm(-2) at 550 degrees C when humidified H-2 was used
   as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The fibrous architecture also shows
   excellent stability under the operating conditions. Further and in
   particular, the high-performance hollow-fiber electrodes are also
   applicable to other energy storage and conversion systems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{High-efficiency rotation based energy harvesters require simultaneous
   scavenging of mechanical energy and rotation-induced wasted thermal
   energy. A hybridized nanogenerator is reported that has an
   electromagnetic generator (EMG), a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG),
   and a thermoelectric generator (ThEG) for simultaneously harvesting
   mechanical and thermal energies in one process. As driven by the
   relative rotation motions between two disks, all of the EMG, TENG and
   ThEG can deliver outputs due to the cooperative operation of
   electromagnetic, triboelectric, and thermoelectric effects. With
   increasing the working time of the hybridized nanogenerator, the output
   power of EMG can be kept in a stable value, and an obvious increase can
   be seen for the output power of ThEG, while the output power of TENG
   exhibited a dramatic decrease. By using the power management circuits,
   all of the EMG, TENG, and ThEG devices can deliver a constant output
   voltage of 5 V, where the hybridized nanogenerator can produce a pulsed
   output current peak of about 160 mA. Moreover, the hybridized
   nanogenerator has been successfully installed in a commercial bicycle to
   scavenge biomechanical energy for lighting up globe lights and charging
   up a cell phone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   perovskite solar cells}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are thought to be promising
   energy power suppliers because of their feasibility for high power
   conversion efficiency (PCE), light weight, and flexible architecture.
   The preparation of charge transporting layers at low temperature has
   been essential for high-performance and flexible PSCs. Recently,
   low-temperature-processed metal oxides have been a desirable material
   for charge transport and air stability for PSCs, instead of organic
   semiconductors. However, pristine metal oxides fabricated at low
   temperature have still precluded high performance of the device because
   of their low conductivity and large deviation in energy levels from the
   conduction band or valance band of the perovskite. Therefore, doping
   metals in the metal oxides has been considered as an effective method to
   endow suitable electrical properties. Herein, we developed a highly
   efficient electron transporting layer (ETL) comprising Li-doped SnO2
   (Li:SnO2) prepared at low temperature in solution. The doped Li in SnO2
   enhanced conductivity as well as induced a downward shift of the
   conduction band minimum of SnO2, which facilitated injection and
   transfer of electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite. The
   PCE was measured to be 18.2\% and 14.78\% for the rigid and flexible
   substrates, respectively. The high-performance and flexible PSCs could
   be potentially used as a wearable energy power source. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the development of wearable/flexible electronics, a formidable
   challenge is to integrate electronic components which were large in
   their original size into a flexible, thin, and arbitrary layout. As an
   in-dispensible component in electronics, commercial
   micro-supercapacitors are disadvantageous in their clumsy cuboid
   geometry and limited capacity, and are not promising for future
   applications. In comparison, film-like micro-supercapacitors are
   superior in miniaturized system integration since they can be folded to
   fit in restricted spaces while maintaining a high level of volumetric
   energy density. Here, we carried out a benchmark study of a
   state-of-the-art well-packaged thin film micro-supercapacitor toward
   commercial micro-supercapacitor and aluminum electrolyte capacitor. The
   micro-planar supercapacitor not only exhibits 3.75 times of a commercial
   micro-supercapacitor and 8785 times of an aluminum electrolytic
   capacitor in volumetric energy density under 1000 mV s(-1) scan rate,
   but can also be tailored into diversified shapes, rolled up, and plugged
   into tiny interstitial spaces inside a device. Such ultrathin (18 mu m)
   micro-supercapacitor component with high volumetric energy density (0.98
   mWh cm(-3) in LiCl-PVA gel, 5.7 mWh cm(-3) in ionic liquid), can be
   integrated into an electronic device system and shows a series of
   superior performance characteristics over current commercial benchmarks,
   which may find vast applications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{353-359}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Electroluminescent refrigeration, though theoretically proposed half a
   century ago, is rarely reported due to the requirement of extremely low
   nonidealities. Here, we theoretically show that by operating the device
   in the near-field regime with a vacuum gap down to 10 nm, photon
   tunneling through evanescent waves can increase the tolerance of
   non-intrinsic nonradiative recombination to 31.6\%. More importantly,
   the refrigeration rate may be enhanced by 2000-fold over the far-field
   scenario. In addition, the lowest achievable cooling temperature against
   the ambient condition of 300 K extends from 284.2 K to 270.6 K. A
   self-consisted model based on the fluctuation-dissipation theory
   combined with dyadic Green's function method is developed considering
   the effect of the chemical potential of photons on the energy of
   Planck's quantum oscillators. This work opens a route to greatly enhance
   electroluminescent refrigeration, while relieving the strict material's
   requirement, for solid-state noncontact thermal management. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Contact electrification between two different materials results in a
   potential difference when they are separated, which has been used as a
   driving force for energy conversion as a result of invention of
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Here, by coupling the
   triboelectricity with semiconductor, a new field of tribotronics has
   been proposed in 2014, which is about the devices fabricated using the
   electrostatic potential created by triboelectrification as a ``gate{''}
   voltage to tune/control electrical transport and transformation in
   semiconductors. Various tribotronic functional devices have been
   developed, such as tribotronic logic circuits, memory, LED and
   phototransistor, with a variety of materials, including silicon,
   flexible organic, MoS2, etc. As an extension of the proposed
   piezoelectric nanogenerator in 2006, piezotronics in 2007 and
   triboelectric nanogenerator in 2012, tribotronics is another original
   and novel field in the development of nano-energy and nano-electronics.
   The concepts and results presented in this review show promises for
   implementing novel micro/nano-electromechanical devices that may derive
   plenty of potentially important research interests and applications in
   sensing, energy harvesting, human-machine interfacing, MEMS/NEMS and
   active flexible/stretchable electronics in the near future. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The water retention curve and relative permeability are critical to
   predict gas and water production from hydrate-bearing sediments.
   However, values for key parameters that characterize gas and water flows
   during hydrate dissociation have not been identified due to experimental
   challenges. This study utilizes the combined techniques of micro-focus
   X-ray computed tomography (CT) and pore-network model simulation to
   identify proper values for those key parameters, such as gas entry
   pressure, residual water saturation, and curve fitting values. Hydrates
   with various saturation and morphology are realized in the pore-network
   that was extracted from micron-resolution CT images of sediments
   recovered from the hydrate deposit at the Mallik site, and then the
   processes of gas invasion, hydrate dissociation, gas expansion, and gas
   and water permeability are simulated. Results show that greater hydrate
   saturation in sediments lead to higher gas entry pressure, higher
   residual water saturation, and steeper water retention curve. An
   increase in hydrate saturation decreases gas permeability but has
   marginal effects on water permeability in sediments with uniformly
   distributed hydrate. Hydrate morphology has more significant impacts
   than hydrate saturation on relative permeability. Sediments with
   heterogeneously distributed hydrate tend to result in lower residual
   water saturation and higher gas and water permeability. In this sense,
   the Brooks-Corey model that uses two fitting parameters individually for
   gas and water permeability properly capture the effect of hydrate
   saturation and morphology on gas and water flows in hydrate-bearing
   sediments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method, called multicycle Q-modulation, which
   can be used in wireless power transmission (WPT) to modulate the quality
   factor (Q) of the receiver (Rx) coil and dynamically optimize the load
   impedance to maximize the power transfer efficiency (PTE) in two-coil
   links. A key advantage of the proposed method is that it can be easily
   implemented using off-the-shelf components without requiring fast
   switching at or above the carrier frequency, which is more suitable for
   integrated circuit design. Moreover, the proposed technique does not
   need any sophisticated synchronization between the power carrier and
   Q-modulation switching pulses. The multicycle Q-modulation is analyzed
   theoretically by a lumped circuit model, and verified in simulation and
   measurement using an off-the-shelf prototype. Automatic resonance tuning
   in the Rx, combined with multicycle Q-modulation helped maximizing PTE
   of the inductive link dynamically in the presence of environmental and
   loading variations, which can otherwise significantly degrade the PTE in
   multicoil settings. In the prototype conventional two-coil link, the
   proposed method increased the power amplifier plus inductive-link
   efficiency from 4.8\% to 16.5\% at (R-L = 1 kW, d(23) = 3 cm), and from
   23\% to 28.2\% at (R-L = 100 Omega, d(23) = 3 cm) after 11\% change in
   the resonance capacitance, while delivering 168.1 mW to the load (PDL).}},

Abstract = {{Process, Voltage, and Temperature variations together with transistor
   Aging (PVTA) can result in significant number of timing errors in Custom
   Instructions (CIs) manufactured at nano-scaled silicon nodes. The
   state-of-the-art approach to tackle this concern is to use guard-band.
   However, this policy can adversely decrease the performance gain
   obtained by CIs as the gap between worst-case delay and true delay due
   to PVTA variations is increased. This paper proposes a novel approximate
   CI selection technique to address this issue. This technique allows the
   applications which do not require perfect accuracy to experience a
   tolerable amount of timing errors imposed by PVTA variations in favor of
   significantly improving the performance of the extensible processor. To
   achieve this, the proposed CI selection technique not only considers
   those CIs which their PVTA-aware delay is less than the given timing
   constraint, but also it takes into account the approximate CIs (i.e.,
   those CIs that cannot strictly meet the timing constraint resulting in
   noisy/approximate computations). First, a timing analysis is performed
   to precisely compute the delay distribution of CIs in the presence of
   workload- and circuit-dependent PVTA variations. Then, based on the
   obtained distribution for each CI, a fault-map (i.e., timing error
   locations) is extracted. Using the fault-map, each circuit-level timing
   error is propagated to application-level to evaluate the
   quality/accuracy of the application output in the presence of
   PVTA-induced errors in approximate CIs. Finally, based on this
   cross-layer information, an optimal set of CIs is selected. This set
   results in maximum performance per silicon area under the given
   constraints on the power consumption and the errors which can be
   tolerated by the user. The simulations for various benchmark
   applications show that the proposed cross-layer technique results in up
   to 2.7x speedup increase compared to the existing techniques, which
   comes at the expense of 6\% more error. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The warehouse problem with deterministic production cost, selling
   prices, and demand was introduced in the 1950s and there is a renewed
   interest recently due to its applications in energy storage and
   arbitrage. In this paper, we consider two extensions of the warehouse
   problem and develop efficient computational algorithms for finding their
   optimal solutions. First, we consider a model where the firm can invest
   in capacity expansion projects for the warehouse while simultaneously
   making production and sales decisions in each period. We show that this
   problem can be solved with a computational complexity that is linear in
   the product of the length of the planning horizon and the number of
   capacity expansion projects. We then consider a problem in which the
   firm can invest to improve production cost efficiency while
   simultaneously making production and sales decisions in each period. The
   resulting optimization problem is non-convex with integer decision
   variables. We show that, under some mild conditions on the cost data,
   the problem can be solved in linear computational time. (c) 2016 Wiley

   four lambda/16 LC pi-networks for a lambda/4 transformer of WPDC,

   can achieve broadband operation and low insertion loss (IL) while saving
   Si die area. The measured results show a minimum IL of 0.45 dB at 10
   GHz. In addition, the IL lower than 1 dB, the isolation (ISO) better
   than 10 dB, and return losses (RL) higher than 10 dB are satisfied from
   5.2 GHz to 18.8 GHz, demonstrating the proposed scheme is applicable to
   wideband operation. The measured amplitude and phase error are within
   0.06 dB and 1.0 degree from DC to 20 GHz, respectively. The core chip
   size is 0.32 x 0.34 mm(2). To the authors' best knowledge, the proposed

Abstract = {{In real-time catheter-based 3-D ultrasound imaging applications,
   gathering data from the transducer arrays is difficult, as there is a
   restriction on cable count due to the diameter of the catheter. Although
   area and power hungry multiplexing circuits integrated at the catheter
   tip are used in some applications, these are unsuitable for use in small
   sized catheters for applications, such as intracardiac imaging.
   Furthermore, the length requirement for catheters and limited power
   available to on-chip cable drivers leads to limited signal strength at
   the receiver end. In this paper, an alternative approach using analog
   time-division multiplexing (TDM) is presented, which addresses the cable
   restrictions of ultrasound catheters. A novel digital demultiplexing
   technique is also described, which allows for a reduction in the number
   of analog signal processing stages required. The TDM and digital
   demultiplexing schemes are demonstrated for an intracardiac imaging
   system that would operate in the 4- to 11-MHz range. A TDM integrated
   circuit (IC) with an 8: 1 multiplexer is interfaced with a fast
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) through a microcoaxial catheter cable
   bundle, and processed with a field-programmable gate array
   register-transfer level simulation. Input signals to the TDM IC are
   recovered with -40-dB crosstalk between the channels on the same
   microcoax, showing the feasibility of this system for ultrasound imaging
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional amplitude and phase modulated pulse sequences for selective
   imaging of nonlinear tissue and ultrasound contrast agents are designed
   for piezoelectric transducers that behave linearly. Inherent
   nonlinearity of capacitive micro-machined ultrasonic transducers
   (CMUTs), especially during large-signal operation, renders these methods
   inapplicable. In this paper, we present different pulse sequences for
   nonlinear imaging that are valid for small-and large-signal CMUT
   operations. For small-signal operation, two-pulse amplitude and phase
   modulation methods for microbubble and tissue harmonic imaging are
   presented, where CMUT nonlinearity is compensated via subharmonic
   excitation. In the large-signal regime, using a nonlinear model, we
   first show that there is a simple linear relationship between the phases
   of each harmonic distortion component generated and the input drive
   signal. Based on this observation, we demonstrate a pulse sequence using
   N + 1 consecutive phase modulated transmit events to extract N harmonics
   of the nonlinear contrast agent echo content uncorrupted by CMUT
   nonlinearity. The proposed methods assume no a priori information about
   the transducer and, therefore, are applicable to any CMUT. The phase
   modulation method is also valid for piezoelectric transducers and
   systems with nonlinearities described by Taylor series where the same
   phase relationship between the input signal and the harmonic content is
   valid. The proof of principle experiments using a commercial contrast
   agent validates the phase modulated pulse sequences for CMUTs, operating
   in a highly nonlinear collapse-snapback mode and for piezoelectric
   transducers.}},

Abstract = {{Aromatic azo compounds are high-value chemicals extensively used as
   pigments, drugs, and food additives, but their production typically
   requires stoichiometric amounts of environmentally unfriendly metals or
   nitrites. There is an urgent need to develop a dual catalytic system
   capable of reducing nitroaromatics to aromatic amines, followed by their
   oxidation to azo compounds. Here we report such a dual catalyst based on
   Ag@Pd-Ag core-frame nanocubes for the stepwise conversion of
   4-nitrothiophenol to trans-4,4'-dimercaptoazobenzene under ambient
   conditions. Our in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy study
   reveals three sequential processes that include the Pd-catalyzed
   reduction of 4-nitrothiophenol to 4-aminothiophenol by hydrogen, a
   period during which the 4-aminothiophenol remain unchanged until all
   hydrogen has depleted, and the Ag-catalyzed oxidation of
   4-aminothiophenol to trans-4,4'-dimercaptoazobenzene by the O-2 from
   air. This work will lead to an environmentally friendly and sustainable
   approach to the production of aromatic azo compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate simulation of ejector flows has been challenging due to the
   difficulties in modeling two-phase supersonic flows of fluids other than
   air or steam at high temperature and pressure conditions. Such modeling
   is necessary for ejector optimization, but the models currently
   available have yet to be validated. A transparent ejector test section
   is designed, fabricated, and operated in an ejector-based chiller loop
   using R134a as the working fluid. Undistorted visual access allows for
   detailed shadowgraph visualization of the motive jet in the mixing
   section at various degrees of condensation. High-speed imaging is used
   with measured temperatures and pressures at the ejector inlets to
   validate available analytical and CFD models. It is found that the best
   modeling techniques assume that the motive flow exits the motive nozzle
   at full thermodynamic equilibrium, and that the k-epsilon RNG turbulence
   model in ANSYS FLUENT captures these equilibrium conditions
   sufficiently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) has been implicated in the
   prevention of excessive ocular elongation and myopia in various animal
   models. This study used retina-specific DA knockout mice to investigate
   the role of retinal DA in refractive development and susceptibility to
   experimental myopia.
   METHODS. Measurements of refractive error, corneal curvature, and ocular
   biometrics were obtained as a function of age for both untreated and
   form-deprived (FD) groups of retina-specific tyrosine hydroxylase
   knockout (rTHKO) and control (Ctrl) mice. Retinas from each group were
   analyzed by HPLC for levels of DA and its primary metabolite (DOPAC).
   RESULTS. Under normal visual conditions, rTHKO mice showed significantly
   myopic refractions (F(1,188) = 7.602, P < 0.001) and steeper corneas
   (main effect of genotype F(1,180) = 5.1, P < 0.01) at 4 and 6 weeks of
   age compared with Ctrl mice. Retina-specific THKO mice also had thinner
   corneas (main effect of genotype F(1,181) = 37.17, P < 0.001), thinner
   retinas (F(6,181) = 6.07, P < 0.001), and shorter axial lengths
   (F(6,181) = 3.78, P < 0.01) than Ctrl mice. Retina-specific THKO retinas
   contained less than 15\% of DA and DOPAC compared with Ctrl retinas, and
   the remaining DA had a significantly higher turnover, as indicated by
   DOPAC/DA ratios (Student's t-test, P < 0.05). Retina-specific THKO mice
   showed similar, yet more variable, responses to 6 weeks of FD compared
   with Ctrl mice.
   CONCLUSIONS. Diminished retinal DA induced spontaneous myopia in mice
   raised under laboratory conditions without form deprivation. The
   relative myopic shift in rTHKO mice may be explained by steeper corneas,
   an unexpected finding. The chronic loss of DA did not significantly
   alter the FD myopia response in rTHKO mice.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a perturbation approach for calculating
   amplitude-dependent Lamb wave dispersion in nonlinear plates. Nonlinear
   dispersion relationships are derived in closed form using a hyperelastic
   stress-strain constitutive relationship, the Green-Lagrange strain
   measure, and the partial wave technique integrated with a
   Lindstedt-Poincare perturbation approach. Solvability conditions are
   derived using an operator formalism with inner product projections
   applied against solutions to the adjoint problem. When applied to the
   first-and second-order problems, these solvability conditions lead to
   amplitude-dependent, nonlinear dispersion corrections for frequency as a
   function of wavenumber. Numerical simulations verify the predicted
   dispersion shifts for an example nonlinear plate. The analysis and
   identification of amplitude-dependent, nonlinear Lamb wave dispersion
   complements recent research focusing on higher harmonic generation and
   internally resonant waves, which require precise dispersion
   relationships for frequency-wavenumber matching. (C) 2016 Acoustical

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Growth factors (GFs) are powerful signaling molecules with the potential
   to drive regenerative strategies, including bone repair and
   vascularization. However, GFs are typically delivered in soluble format
   at supraphysiological doses because of rapid clearance and limited
   therapeutic impact. These high doses have serious side effects and are
   expensive. Although it is well established that GF interactions with
   extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin control GF
   presentation and activity, a translation-ready approach to unlocking GF
   potential has not been realized. We demonstrate a simple, robust, and
   controlledmaterial-based approach to enhance the activity of GFs during
   tissue healing. The underlyingmechanism is based on spontaneous
   fibrillar organization of fibronectin driven by adsorption onto the
   polymer poly(ethyl acrylate). Fibrillar fibronectin on this polymer, but
   not a globular conformation obtained on control polymers, promotes
   synergistic presentation of integrin-binding sites and bound bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which enhances mesenchymal stem cell
   osteogenesis in vitro and drives full regeneration of a nonhealing bone
   defect in vivo at low GF concentrations. This simple and translatable
   technology could unlock the full regenerative potential of GF therapies
   while improving safety and cost-effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and analysis of a passive body weight
   (BW)-support lower extremity exoskeleton (LEE) with compliant joints to

   decouples human gait into two phases, stance and swing, by a dual snap
   fit. The knee joint transfers the BW to the ground in the stance phases
   and is compliant to free the leg in the swing phases. Along with a leg
   dynamic model and a knee biomechanical model, the unmeasurable knee
   internal forces are simulated. The concept feasibility and dynamic
   models of the passive LEE design have been experimentally validated with
   measured plantar forces. The reduced knee forces confirm the
   effectiveness of the LEE in supporting human BW during walking and also
   provide a basis for computing the internal knee forces as a percentage
   of BW. Energy harvested from the hip spring reveals that the LEE can

Abstract = {{The method for the preparation of elemental silicon of sufficient purity
   for the fabrication of electronic devices is by first converting silicon
   oxide to silicon-hydrogen-chloride compounds, purifying the material as
   a fluid mixture, and then converting the product to solid silicon.
   During the purification process a mixture of dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2),
   trichlorosilane (SiHCl3), and tetrachlorosilane or silicon tetrachloride
   (SiCl4) are formed with each of the components in significant
   quantities. Models that describe the vapor liquid equilibrium behavior
   for the mixtures are required to design appropriate separation and
   purification processes. Pure fluid properties form the starting point
   for most mixture models, hence the importance of vapor pressures for the
   pure materials. In this work we report measurements of the vapor
   pressures for three of the most important fluids in the silicon
   production process, dichlorosilane, trichlorosilane, and
   tetrachlorosilane. Our results are compared with measurements reported
   previously. The instability of chlorosilanes complicates the
   experimental procedures because of the corrosive nature of the products
   formed, and in particular the potential for self-ignition upon exposure
   to moist air. The experimental procedures used to minimize the hazards
   and to avoid contamination of the fluids are described.}},

Abstract = {{The standard of care for glioblastoma (GBM) is maximal safe resection
   followed by radiation therapy with chemotherapy. Currently,
   contrast-enhanced MRI is used to define primary treatment volumes for
   surgery and radiation therapy. However, enhancement does not identify
   the tumor entirely, resulting in limited local control. Proton
   spectroscopic MRI (sMRI), a method reporting endogenous metabolism, may
   better define the tumor margin. Here, we develop a whole-brain sMRI
   pipeline and validate sMRI metrics with quantitative measures of tumor
   infiltration.
   Whole-brain sMRI metabolite maps were coregistered with surgical
   planning MRI and imported into a neuronavigation system to guide tissue
   sampling in GBM patients receiving 5-aminolevulinic acid
   fluorescence-guided surgery. Samples were collected from regions with
   metabolic abnormalities in a biopsy-like fashion before bulk resection.
   Tissue fluorescence was measured ex vivo using a hand-held spectrometer.
   Tissue samples were immunostained for Sox2 and analyzed to quantify the
   density of staining cells using a novel digital pathology image analysis
   tool. Correlations among sMRI markers, Sox2 density, and ex vivo
   fluorescence were evaluated.
   Spectroscopic MRI biomarkers exhibit significant correlations with
   Sox2-positive cell density and ex vivo fluorescence. The choline to
   N-acetylaspartate ratio showed significant associations with each
   quantitative marker (Pearson's rho = 0.82, P < .001 and rho = 0.36, P <
   .0001, respectively). Clinically, sMRI metabolic abnormalities predated
   contrast enhancement at sites of tumor recurrence and exhibited an
   inverse relationship with progression-free survival.
   As it identifies tumor infiltration and regions at high risk for
   recurrence, sMRI could complement conventional MRI to improve local
   control in GBM patients.}},

Abstract = {{Querying over encrypted data is gaining increasing popularity in
   cloud-based data hosting services. Security and efficiency are
   recognized as two important and yet conflicting requirements for
   querying over encrypted data. In this article, we propose an efficient
   private keyword search (EPKS) scheme that supports binary search and
   extend it to dynamic settings (called DEPKS) for inverted index-based
   encrypted data. First, we describe our approaches of constructing a
   searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) scheme that supports binary
   search. Second, we present a novel framework for EPKS and provide its
   formal security definitions in terms of plaintext privacy and predicate
   privacy by modifying Shen et al.' s security notions {[}Shen et al.
   2009]. Third, built on the proposed framework, we design an EPKS scheme
   whose complexity is logarithmic in the number of keywords. The scheme is
   based on the groups of prime order and enjoys strong notions of
   security, namely statistical plaintext privacy and statistical predicate
   privacy. Fourth, we extend the EPKS scheme to support dynamic keyword
   and document updates. The extended scheme not only maintains the
   properties of logarithmic-time search efficiency and plaintext privacy
   and predicate privacy but also has fewer rounds of communications for
   updates compared to existing dynamic search encryption schemes. We
   experimentally evaluate the proposed EPKS and DEPKS schemes and show
   that they are significantly more efficient in terms of both keyword
   search complexity and communication complexity than existing randomized
   SSE schemes.}},

Title = {{Electricity generation from corn cob char though a direct carbon solid

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{250-258}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a potential technology for utilizing
   biomass to generate electricity with high conversion efficiency and low
   pollution. Investigations on biomass integrated gasification SOFC system
   show that gasifier is one of the high cost factors which impede the
   practical application of such systems. Direct carbon solid oxide fuel
   cell (DC-SOFC) may provide a cost effective option for electricity
   generation from biomass because it can operate directly using biochar as
   the fuel so that the gasification process can be avoided. In this paper,
   the feasibility of using corn cob char as the fuel of a DC-SOFC to
   generate electricity is investigated. Electrolyte-supported SOFCs, with
   yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte, cermet of silver
   and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) as the anode and the cathode, are
   prepared and tested with fixed bed corn cob char as fuel and static
   ambient air as oxidant. The maximum power output of a DC-SOFC operated
   on pure corn cob char is 204 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and it achieves
   270 mW cm(-2) when Fe of 5\% mass fraction, as a catalyst of the
   Boudouard reaction, is loaded on the corn cob char. The discharging time
   of the cell with 0.5 g corn cob char operated at a constant current of
   0.1 A lasts 17 h, representing a fuel conversion of 38\%. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
   spectrometer (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy have been applied to
   characterize the char-based fuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{While there is considerable interest in zinc oxide nanomaterials for
   optoelectronics research, one weakness of the material is the difficulty
   in producing p-type zinc oxide. This can be attributed to a number of
   factors such as acceptor instability, donor compensation during growth,
   and the formation of deep acceptors. Recently, it was discovered that
   antimony is a stable p-type dopant in hydrothermally grown ZnO
   nanowires, and this method has been modified to produce ultra-long
   nanowires and homojunction thin films. In order to broaden the
   applicability of this new material, it is important to investigate how
   it interacts with other semiconducting nanomaterials. In this work we
   demonstrate a solution grown p-ZnO/n-Si nanowire heterojunction. After
   investigating its basic materials properties, we show its applicability
   as an photodetector with responsivity as high as 1.02 A/W at 442 nm, an
   order of magnitude higher than similar nanostructures based on n-type
   ZnO and p-type Si. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In device-to-device (D2D) communications, channel state information
   (CSI) is exploited to manage the interference between D2D users and
   regular cellular users (CUs) and improve system performance. However,
   obtaining the accurate CSI is usually difficult and causes high
   overhead, particularly when the links are not connected to the base
   station (BS), such as the links between regular CUs and D2D receivers
   (CU-D links). In this paper, we investigate the signaling overhead and
   performance tradeoff in D2D communications with channel uncertainty. To
   limit interference to regular CUs, we only allow the resource of a CU to
   be reused by, at most, one D2D pair. We also assume that only partial
   CSI of the CU-D links is available at the BS and develop two different
   strategies to deal with the channel uncertainty, namely, probabilistic
   and partial feedback schemes. We first derive a probability-based
   resource-allocation scheme by utilizing channel statistical
   characteristics to maximize the overall throughput of the CUs and
   admissible D2D pairs while guaranteeing their quality of service (QoS)
   in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and outage
   probability, respectively. Then, we propose an efficient feedback scheme
   to reduce the overhead of CSI feedback while providing near-optimal
   performance. In addition, we propose a combined scheme to take
   advantages of both probabilistic and partial feedback schemes. It is
   shown by simulation that there exists an optimal threshold of the outage
   probability for probabilistic scheme while the partial feedback scheme
   is robust to the channel models. Furthermore, the combined scheme
   outperforms the probabilistic and the partial feedback schemes in terms
   of overall throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Multistream carrier aggregation (MSCA) is a promising technique to boost
   data rates by enabling users to connect with multiple base stations

   association and resource allocation for MSCA systems to achieve energy
   efficiency (EE) balance among different BSs. We aim at maximizing the
   weighted summation of EE values for different BSs, which is modeled as a
   nonconvex combinatorial sum-of-ratios optimization problem. To develop
   an upper bound algorithm, we first relax the combinatorial variables and
   then transform the problem into a series of convex optimization problems
   by the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. We also propose a
   low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which divides the original
   optimization problem into two steps: user association and channel
   allocation, as well as power allocation. Numerical results show that the
   proposed algorithms can achieve flexible EE tradeoff among BSs, and the
   EE can be significantly improved with MSCA.}},

Abstract = {{With device-to-device (D2D) communications, a user terminal can be used
   as a relay node to support multi-hop transmission, so that cell-edge or
   deeply faded users can obtain a better connective experience. In this
   paper, we investigate energy-efficient mobile association in D2D-enabled
   heterogeneous networks. We consider joint access point selection, mode
   switching, D2D relay node (DRN) selection, and power control to maximize
   the energy efficiency (EE) of uplink transmission while guaranteeing the
   quality-of-service requirement of users. The optimization problem can be
   decomposed into three subproblems: access point selection, power
   control, and joint mode switching and DRN selection. The joint mode
   switching and DRN selection problem is a 0-1 integer optimization
   problem, whose optimal solution can be found by the brute-force
   searching method that is complexity-prohibitive when the number of DRNs
   is large. To reduce the complexity involved in computation, channel
   estimation, and feedback, we develop a distance-based mobile association
   (DMA) algorithm, which only operates based on the location information
   of users and DRNs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DMA
   algorithm can achieve a good tradeoff between the EE and the complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent data indicates that DJ-1 plays a role in the cellular response to
   stress. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms
   mediating the actions of DJ-1 in the heart following myocardial
   ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In response to I/R injury, DJ-1 KO
   mice displayed increased areas of infarction and worsened left
   ventricular function when compared to WT mice, confirming a protective
   role for DJ-1 in the heart. In an effort to evaluate the potential
   mechanism(s) responsible for the increased injury in DJ-1 KO mice, we
   focused on SUMOylation, a post-translational modification process that
   regulates various aspects of protein function. DJ-1 KO hearts after I/R
   injury were found to display enhanced accumulation of SUMO-1 modified
   proteins and reduced SUMO-2/3 modified proteins. Further analysis,
   revealed that the protein expression of the deSUMOylation enzyme SENP1
   was reduced, whereas the expression of SENP5 was enhanced in DJ-1 KO
   hearts after I/R injury. Finally, DJ-1 KO hearts were found to display
   enhanced SUMO-1 modification of dynamin-related protein 1, excessive
   mitochondrial fission, and dysfunctional mitochondria. Our data
   demonstrates that the activation of DJ-1 in response to myocardial I/R
   injury protects the heart by regulating the SUMOylation status of Drp1
   and attenuating excessive mitochondrial fission. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized in situ
   under white light at room temperature using aqueous silk fibroin (SF)
   obtained from Bombyxmori silk. The UV-visible spectroscopy revealed the
   formation of AgNPs by showing a typical surface Plasmon resonance (SPR)
   band at 422 nm from the UV-visible spectra. The transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) images show that the formed nanoparticles were
   spherical in shape with smooth surfaces. The particle diameter was
   around 35-40 nm. Further the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms
   the nanocrystalline phase of silver with face centered cubic (FCC)
   crystal structure. The biogenic silver nanoparticles exhibited
   significant antibacterial activity against human bacterial pathogens
   Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and
   Escherichia coli.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enables many applications such as
   smart grid, vehicular safety, and health care among many others. To
   achieve ubiquitous data transportation among objects and the surrounding
   environment, deploying spectrum sharing M2M communications with existing
   wireless networks is a must. A general large-scale cognitive M2M network
   (CM2MN), adopting cognitive radio technology, consists of multiradio
   systems, the primary system (PS), and secondary system(s) with
   tremendous cooperative cognitive machines, under heterogeneous wireless
   architecture. For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
   nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless
   fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level
   do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service
   (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for
   such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we
   propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative
   relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multipleoutput (MIMO)
   communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network
   coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first
   proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on
   the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS
   control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the
   session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with
   PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial
   multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end
   throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution,
   the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are
   obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing
   in large CM2MNs.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the Materials Genome Initiative is to substantially reduce
   the time and cost of materials design and deployment. Achieving this
   goal requires taking advantage of the recent advances in data and
   information sciences. This critical need has impelled the emergence of a
   new discipline, called materials data science and informatics. This
   emerging new discipline not only has to address the core
   scientific/technological challenges related to datafication of materials
   science and engineering, but also, a number of equally important
   challenges around data-driven transformation of the current culture,
   practices, and workflows employed for materials innovation. A
   comprehensive effort that addresses both of these aspects in a
   synergistic manner is likely to succeed in realizing the vision of
   scaled-up materials innovation. Key toolsets needed for the successful
   adoption of materials data science and informatics in materials
   innovation are identified and discussed in this article. Prototypical
   examples of emerging novel toolsets and their functionality are
   described along with select case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the critical depth for ductile-mode grinding of
   brittle materials is important to grinding process optimization and
   quality control. The traditional models for predicting the critical
   depth are mainly concerned with the material properties without
   considering the operation parameters. This article presents a new
   critical energy model for brittle-ductile transition by considering the
   strain rate effect brought by the grinding wheel speed and chip
   thickness. The experiments will be conducted through a high-speed
   diamond grinder on reaction-sintered silicon carbide materials under
   different grinding speed and chip thickness. Through detailed analysis
   of the strain rate effect on the dynamic fracture toughness, a new
   fracture toughness model will be established based on the
   Johnson-Holmquist material model (JH-2) and calibrated through
   experiments based on the indentation fracture mechanics. Then, the new
   critical model for brittle-ductile transition will be established by
   introducing the dynamic facture toughness model considering the wheel
   speed and chip thickness. According to scanning electron microscope
   observations, the results show that ductile-mode grinding can be
   obtained through a combination of higher grinding speed and smaller chip
   thickness. Moreover, the critical value for ductile grinding of brittle
   materials can be improved through the elevation of the grinding speed or
   reduction in the chip thickness.}},

Abstract = {{We report high-performance self-aligned MoS2 field-effect transistors
   (FETs) with enhanced photoresponsivity by the piezo-phototronic effect.
   The FETs are fabricated based on monolayer MoS2 with a piezoelectric GaN
   nanowire (NW) as the local gate, and a self-aligned process is employed
   to define the source/drain electrodes. The fabrication method allows the
   preservation of the intrinsic property of MoS2 and suppresses the
   scattering center density in the MoS2/GaN interface, which results in
   high electrical and photoelectric performances. MoS2 FETs with channel
   lengths of similar to 200 nm have been fabricated with a small
   subthreshold slope of 64 mV/dec. The photoresponsivity is 443.3 A.W-1,
   with a fast response and recovery time of similar to 5ms under 550 nm
   light illumination. When strain is introduced into the GaN NW, the
   photoresponsivity is further enhanced to 734.5 A.W-1 and maintains
   consistent response and recovery time, which is comparable with that of
   the mechanical exfoliation of MoS2 transistors. The approach presented
   here opens an avenue to high-performance top-gated piezo-enhanced MoS2
   photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of Internet of Things and the related sensor
   technology requires sustainable power sources for their continuous
   operation. Scavenging and utilizing the ambient environmental energy
   could be a superior solution. Here, we report a self powered helmet for
   emergency, which was powered by the energy converted from ambient
   mechanical vibration via a hybridized nanogenerator that consists of a
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an electromagnetic generator
   (EMG). Integrating with transformers and rectifiers, the hybridized
   nanogenerator can deliver a power density up to 167.22 W/m(3), which was
   demonstrated to light up 1000 commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
   instantaneously. By wearing the developed safety helmet, equipped with
   rationally designed hybridized nanogenerator, the harvested vibration
   energy from natural human motion is also capable of powering a wireless
   pedometer for real-time transmitting data reporting to a personal cell
   phone. Without adding much extra weight to a commercial one, the
   developed wearing helmet can be a superior sustainable power source for
   explorers, engineers, mine-workers under well, as well as and
   disaster-relief workers, especially in remote areas. This work not only
   presents a significant step toward energy harvesting from human
   biomechanical movement, but also greatly expands the applicability of
   TENGs as power sources for self-sustained electronics.}},

   The Ag nanowires took a penta-twinned structure, and they could be
   obtained rapidly (<35 min) and in high morphology purity (>85\% of the
   as-obtained solid product) under atmospheric pressure. The key to the
   success of this synthesis is to restrain the nanowires from lateral
   growth by employing both Br ions and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) with a high
   molecular weight of 1 300 000 g/mol to cap the \{100\} side faces,
   together with the use of a syringe pump to slowly introduce AgNO3 into
   the reaction solution. By optimizing the ratios between the capping
   agents and AgNO3, we were able to slow down the reduction kinetics and
   effectively direct the Ag nanowires to grow along the longitudinal
   direction only. The nanowires showed great mechanical flexibility and
   could be bent with acute angles without breaking. Because of their small
   diameters, the transverse localized surface plasmon resonance peak of
   the Ag nanowires could be pushed down to the ultraviolet region, below
   400 nm, making them ideal conductive elements for the fabrication of
   touch screens, solar cells, and smart windows.}},

Abstract = {{The drastic expansion of consumer electronics (like personal computers,
   touch pads, smart phones, etc.) creates many human-machine interfaces
   and multiple types of interactions between human and electronics.
   Considering the high frequency of such operations in our daily life, an
   extraordinary amount of biomechanical energy from typing or pressing
   buttons is available. In this study, we have demonstrated a highly
   flexible tribo electric nanogenerator (TENG) solely made from
   elastomeric materials as a cover on a conventional keyboard to harvest
   biomechanical energy from typing. A dual-mode working mechanism is
   established with a high transferred charge density of similar to 140 mu
   C/m(2) due to both structural and material innovations. We have also
   carried out fundamental investigations of its performance dependence on
   various structural factors for optimizing the electric output in
   practice. The fully packaged keyboard shaped TENG is further integrated
   with a horn-like polypyrrole-based super capacitor as a self-powered
   system. Typing in normal speed for 1 h, similar to 8 X 10(-4) J
   electricity could be stored, which is capable of driving an electronic
   thermometer/hydrometer. Our keyboard performs outstanding long-term
   stability, water resistance, as well as insensitivity to surface
   conditions, and the last feature makes it useful to research the typing
   behaviors of different people.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of Au-based cubic nanoboxes as small as 20
   nm for the outer edge length, together with well-defined openings at the
   corners and walls fewer than 10 atomic layers (or <2 nm) in thickness.
   The success relies on the selective formation of Ag2O at the corners of
   Ag nanocubes, followed by the conformal deposition of Au on the side
   faces in a layer-by-layer fashion. When six atomic layers of Au are
   formed on the side faces to generate Ag@Au-6L core shell nanocubes, we
   can selectively remove the Ag2O patches at the corner sites using a weak
   acid, making it possible to further remove the Ag core by H2O2 etching
   without breaking the ultrathin Au shell. This synthetic approach works
   well for Ag nanocubes of 38 and 18 nm in edge length, and the wall
   thickness of the nanoboxes can be controlled down to 2 nm. The resultant
   Au nanoboxes exhibit strong plasmonic absorption in the near-infrared
   region, consistent with computational simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid and gas flow sensors are important components of the micro total
   analysis systems (ETAS) for modern analytical sciences. In this paper,
   we proposed a self powered triboelectric microfluidic sensor (TMS) by
   utilizing the signals produced from the droplet/bubble via the capillary
   and the triboelectrification effects on the liquid/ solid interface for
   real-time liquid and gas flow detection. By alternating capillary with
   different diameters, the sensor's detecting range and sensitivity can be
   adjusted. Both the relationship between the droplet/bubble and capillary
   size, and the output signal of the sensor are systematically studied. By
   demonstrating the monitoring of the transfusion process for a patient
   and the gas flow produced from an injector, it shows that TMS has a
   great potential in building a self powered micro total analysis system.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Annuloplasty ring dehiscence is a well described mode of
   mitral valve repair failure. Defining the mechanisms underlying
   dehiscence may facilitate its prevention.
   Methods. Factors that govern suture dehiscence were examined with an
   ovine model. After undersized ring annuloplasty in live animals (n = 5),
   cyclic force (FC) that acts on sutures during cardiac contraction was
   measured with custom transducers. FC was measured at ten suture
   positions, throughout cardiac cycles with peak left ventricular pressure
   (LVPmax) of 100, 125, and 150 mm Hg. Suture pullout testing was
   conducted on explanted mitral annuli (n = 12) to determine suture
   holding strength at each position. Finally, relative collagen density
   differences at suture sites around the annulus were assessed by
   two-photon excitation fluoroscopy.
   Results. Anterior F-C exceeded posterior F-C at each LVPmax (eg, 2.8 +/-
   1.3 N versus 1.8 +/- 1.2 N at LVPmax = 125 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Anterior
   holding strength exceeded posterior holding strength (6.4 +/- 3.6 N
   versus 3.9 +/- 1.6 N, p < 0.0001). On the basis of F-C at LVPmax of 150
   mm Hg, margin of safety before suture pullout was vastly higher between
   the trigones (exclusive) versus elsewhere (4.8 +/- 0.9N versus 1.9 +/-
   0.5N, p < 0.001). Margin of safety exhibited strong correlation to
   collagen density (R-2 = 0.947).
   Conclusions. Despite lower cyclic loading on posterior sutures, the
   weaker posterior mitral annular tissue creates higher risk of
   dehiscence, apparently because of reduced collagen content. Sutures
   placed atop the trigones are less secure than predicted, because of a
   combination of reduced collagen and higher overall rigidity in this
   region. These findings highlight the inter-trigonal tissue as the
   superior anchor and have implications on the design and implantation
   techniques for next-generation mitral prostheses. (C) 2016 by The

Abstract = {{The grating coupling efficiencies for interlayer connection (overlaid
   chips) were previously calculated using the new rigorous coupled-wave
   analysis equivalent-index-slab (RCWA-EIS) method. The chip-to-chip
   coupling efficiencies were determined for rectangular-groove (binary)
   gratings. In the present work, the search algorithms used in the
   RCWA-EIS method are optimized giving rise to improved definition of
   equivalent indices. Further, the versatility of the RCWA-EIS method is
   demonstrated by extending it to (nonbinary) parallelogramic gratings,
   sawtooth gratings, and volume gratings. The finite-difference
   time-domain method is used to verify the results. This demonstrates the
   flexibility of the RCWA-EIS method in analyzing arbitrary 1D gratings.

Abstract = {{Background: Various approaches to calling single-nucleotide variants
   (SNVs) or insertion-or-deletion (indel) mutations have been developed
   based on next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, most of them are
   dedicated to a particular type of mutation, e.g. germline SNVs in normal
   cells, somatic SNVs in cancer/tumor cells, or indels only. In the
   literature, efficient and integrated callers for both germline and
   somatic SNVs/indels have not yet been extensively investigated.
   Results: We present SNVSniffer, an efficient and integrated caller
   identifying both germline and somatic SNVs/indels from NGS data. In this
   algorithm, we propose the use of Bayesian probabilistic models to
   identify SNVs and investigate a multiple ungapped alignment approach to
   call indels. For germline variant calling, we model allele counts per
   site to follow a multinomial conditional distribution. For somatic
   variant calling, we rely on paired tumor-normal pairs from identical
   individuals and introduce a hybrid subtraction and joint sample analysis
   approach by modeling tumor-normal allele counts per site to follow a
   joint multinomial conditional distribution. A comprehensive performance
   evaluation has been conducted using a diversity of variant calling
   benchmarks. For germline variant calling, SNVSniffer demonstrates highly
   competitive accuracy with superior speed in comparison with the
   state-of-the-art FaSD, GATK and SAMtools. For somatic variant calling,
   our algorithm achieves comparable or even better accuracy, at fast
   speed, than the leading VarScan2, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2 and
   MuTect.
   Conclusions: SNVSniffers demonstrates the feasibility to develop
   integrated solutions to fast and efficient identification of germline
   and somatic variants. Nonetheless, accurate discovery of genetic
   variations is critical yet challenging, and still requires substantially
   more research efforts being devoted. SNVSniffer and synthetic samples
   are publicly available at http://snvsniffer.sourceforge.net.}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative decision making (CDM) has been used as an essential
   paradigm to increase the efficiency of air traffic flow management
   (ATFM), including takeoff or landing operations at airports. Air traffic
   control (ATC) services and airlines have been involved in the current
   CDM, but airport management service, an important stakeholder, has not
   been involved yet, generally. This paper proposes a new CDM model, which
   is named satisficing CDM, that is based on the satisficing game theory.
   This model includes three main entities (ATC, airlines, and airport
   management) in ATFM. The complete set of functions (preference,
   rejectability, and selectability) is established for each of the
   entities. Because the delay due to ground or air holding potentially
   alters the takeoff or the landing order of a flight, the sequence of
   takeoff and landing is determined through the satisficing negotiation
   process. To demonstrate the utility of the developed intelligent system,
   experiments are run with real air traffic in the terminal area of Sao
   Paulo. The experimental results show the importance and effectiveness of
   including airport management services in CDM. The sequences of takeoff
   and landing determined by the proposed model mostly meet the preferences
   of the three stakeholders in the given real traffic scenarios.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Abstract = {{We derive the John-Sclavounos equations, describing the motion of a
   fluid particle on the sea surface, from first principles using
   Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms applied to the motion of a
   frictionless particle constrained on an unsteady surface. This framework
   leads to a number of new insights into the particle kinematics. The main
   result is that vorticity generated on a stress-free surface vanishes at
   a wave crest when the horizontal particle velocity equals the crest
   propagation speed, which is the kinematic criterion for wave breaking.
   If this holds for the largest crest, then the symplectic two-form
   associated with the Hamiltonian dynamics reduces instantaneously to that
   associated with the motion of a particle in free flight, as if the
   surface did not exist. Further, exploiting the conservation of the
   Hamiltonian function for steady surfaces and travelling waves, we show
   that particle velocities remain bounded at all times, ruling out the
   possibility of the finite-time blowup of solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneous palladium-catalyzed Suzuki reactions between model
   aryl bromides (4-bronwanisole, bromoaniline, 4-amino-2-bromopyridine,
   and 2-bromopyridine) and phenylboronic acid have been successfully
   conducted in water with no added ligand at the 100 mL scale using 20-40
   mmol of aryl bromide. The product yields associated with these
   substrates were optimized, and key reaction parameters affecting the
   yields were identified. The results clearly indicate that the reaction
   parameters necessary to achieve high yields are substrate-dependent. In
   addition, it is demonstrated that aqueous Suzuki reactions of substrates
   containing basic nitrogen centers can produce quantitative yields of
   desired products in the absence of added ligand.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{High false alarm rates in the ICU decrease quality of care by slowing
   staff response times while increasing patient delirium through noise
   pollution. The 2015 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge provides
   a set of 1250 multi-parameter ICU data segments associated with critical
   arrhythmia alarms, and challenges the general research community to
   address the issue of false alarm suppression using all available
   signals. Each data segment was 5 minutes long ( for real time analysis),
   ending at the time of the alarm. For retrospective analysis, we provided
   a further 30 seconds of data after the alarm was triggered.
   A total of 750 data segments were made available for training and 500
   were held back for testing. Each alarm was reviewed by expert
   annotators, at least two of whom agreed that the alarm was either true
   or false. Challenge participants were invited to submit a complete,
   working algorithm to distinguish true from false alarms, and received a
   score based on their program's performance on the hidden test set. This
   score was based on the percentage of alarms correct, but with a penalty
   that weights the suppression of true alarms five times more heavily than
   acceptance of false alarms.
   We provided three example entries based on well-known, open source
   signal processing algorithms, to serve as a basis for comparison and as
   a starting point for participants to develop their own code. A total of
   38 teams submitted a total of 215 entries in this year's Challenge.
   This editorial reviews the background issues for this challenge, the
   design of the challenge itself, the key achievements, and the follow-up
   research generated as a result of the Challenge, published in the
   concurrent special issue of Physiological Measurement. Additionally we
   make some recommendations for future changes in the field of patient
   monitoring as a result of the Challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The hemicellulose xylan, which has immunomodulatory effects, has been
   combined with chitosan to form a composite hydrogel to improve the
   healing of bone fractures. This thermally responsive and injectable
   hydrogel, which is liquid at room temperature and gels at physiological
   temperature, improves the response of animal host tissue compared with
   similar pure chitosan hydrogels in tissue engineering models. The
   composite hydrogel was placed in a subcutaneous model where the
   composite hydrogel is replaced by host tissue within 1 week, much
   earlier than chitosan hydrogels. A tibia fracture model in mice showed
   that the composite encourages major remodeling of the fracture callus in
   less than 4 weeks. A non-union fracture model in rat femurs was used to
   demonstrate that the composite hydrogel allows bone regeneration and
   healing of defects that with no treatment are unhealed after 6 weeks.
   These results suggest that the xylan/chitosan composite hydrogel is a
   suitable bone graft substitute able to aid in the repair of large bone
   defects. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{953-960}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: To increase detection of mislabeled medical
   imaging studies, evidence shows it may be useful to include patient
   photographs during interpretation. This study examined how inclusion of
   photographs impacts visual search.
   Materials and Methods: Ten radiologists participated. Average age was
   43.00 years and average years Board-certified was 9.70, with 2
   residents, 1 general, 2 abdominal, 4 cardiothoracic, and 1 pediatric
   radiologist. They viewed 21 portable chest radiographs with and without
   a simultaneously acquired photograph of the patient while visual search
   was recorded. Their task was to note placement of lines and tubes.
   Results: Presence of the photograph reduced the number of fixations
   (chest radiograph only mean 98.68; chest with photograph present 80.81;
   photograph 10.59; p < 0.0001) and total dwell (chest radiograph only
   mean 30.84 seconds; chest radiograph with photograph present 25.68;
   photograph 3.93; p < 0.0001) on the chest radiograph as a result of
   periodically looking at the photograph. Overall viewing time did not
   increase with addition of the photograph because time not spent on the
   radiograph was spent on the photograph. On average, readers scanned from
   the radiograph to the photographs about four times during search. Men
   and non-cardiothoracic radiologists spent significantly more time
   scanning all the images, including the photographs. Average preference
   for having photographs was 6.10 on a 0-10 scale, and neck and chest were
   preferred as areas to include in the photograph.
   Conclusion: Photographs may help with certain image interpretation tasks
   and may help personalize the reading experience for radiologists without
   increasing interpretation time.}},

Abstract = {{One in six men will develop prostate cancer in his lifetime. Early
   detection and accurate diagnosis of the disease can improve cancer
   survival and reduce treatment costs. Recently, imaging of prostate.
   cancer has greatly advanced since the introduction of multiparametric
   magnetic, resonance imaging (mp-MRI). Mp-MRI, consists of T2-weighted
   sequences combined with functional sequences including dynamic
   contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy imaging. Because of the big data and variations in imaging
   sequences, detection can be affected by multiple factors such as
   observer variability and visibility and complexity of the lesions. To
   improve quantitative assessment of the disease, various computer-aided
   detection systems have been designed to help radiologists in their
   clinical practice. This review paper presents an overview of literatures
   on computer-aided detection of prostate cancer with mp-MRI, which
   include the technology and its applications. The aim of the survey is
   threefold: an introduction for those new to the field, an overview for
   those working in the field, and a reference for those searching for

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a gradient-based method, along with the design
   concept, characteristics, and operating range of a magnetic tensor
   sensor (MTS), for locating and identifying a ferrous/magnetic object in
   the presence of geomagnetic field. This method characterizes the
   magnetic moment M and position vector R of a ferrous/magnetic object in
   terms of two scalar parameters (an orientation-insensitive P and a
   distance-insensitive.) derived from the measured magnetic tensor data.
   These scalar parameters offer an excellent alternative to the
   traditional (M and R) in characterizing a magnetic object with an
   arbitrary shape for some applications when the dipole model is a poor
   approximation. With a prototype MTS that has been developed and
   experimentally validated, the effectiveness and accuracy of the
   gradient-based method are demonstrated with two different types of
   compact objects. The first object is a uniformly magnetized cylindrical
   permanent magnet, commonly used as an engineered landmark for machine
   applications, where the interest is to accurately determine M and/or R.
   The second object is an example of a general ferrous object with a
   non-uniform shape to illustrate the detection and approximate
   localization of a ferrous object for applications such as visually
   impaired assistance.}},

Abstract = {{A novel predictive generator out-of-step protection and transient
   stability monitoring scheme is presented. It is based on real-time
   dynamic monitoring of the system, enabled by a distributed dynamic state
   estimator (DSE). DSE utilizes local synchronized and nonsynchronized
   measurements and provides the evolution of the system's dynamic state at
   rates of 60 times/s. The real-time dynamic model is then utilized to
   evaluate the system's energy function based on Lyapunov's direct method,
   estimate the stability barrier, and characterize its stability. The two
   major components of the scheme are: 1) the calculation of the system's
   center of oscillations and 2) the derivation in real time of an
   equivalent, reduced size model used for the calculation of the generator
   stability barrier and its stability characterization. It is shown that
   the major advantage of the proposed scheme, compared with legacy
   generator impedance relay-based out-of-step protection, is that the
   out-of-step condition is predicted before its occurrence and the
   generator can be tripped much faster than the traditional scheme. The
   theoretical background of the scheme and application on an actual system
   are presented. The proposed scheme characterizes very accurate potential
   generator instability and predicts generator loss of synchronism before
   its occurrence, before the generator slips a pole.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostics, drug delivery, and other biomedical industries rely on
   cross-linking ligands to microbead surfaces. Microbead functionalization
   requires multiple steps of liquid exchange, incubation, and mixing,
   which are laborious and time intensive. Although automated systems
   exist, they are expensive and cumbersome, limiting their routine use in
   biomedical laboratories. We present a small, bench-top robotic system
   that automates microparticle functionalization and streamlines sample
   preparation. The robot uses a programmable microcontroller to regulate
   liquid exchange, incubation, and mixing functions. Filters with a pore
   diameter smaller than the minimum bead diameter are used to prevent bead
   loss during liquid exchange. The robot uses three liquid reagents and
   processes up to 10(7) microbeads per batch. The effectiveness of
   microbead functionalization was compared with a manual covalent coupling
   process and evaluated via flow cytometry and fluorescent imaging. The
   mean percentages of successfully functionalized beads were 91\% and 92\%
   for the robot and manual methods, respectively, with less than 5\% bead
   loss. Although the two methods share similar qualities, the automated
   approach required approximately 10 min of active labor, compared with 3
   h for the manual approach. These results suggest that a low-cost,
   automated microbead functionalization system can streamline sample
   preparation with minimal operator intervention.}},

   result of interaction with the reactant molecules when the nanoparticles

   second-generation nanoclusters is manifested by a decrease of the

Abstract = {{Nanocages have received considerable attention in recent years for
   catalytic applications owing to their high utilization efficiency of
   atoms and well-defined facets. Here we report, for the first time, the
   synthesis of Ru cubic nanocages with ultrathin walls, in which the atoms
   are crystallized in a face-centered cubic (fcc) rather than hexagonal
   close-packed (hcp) structure. The key to the success of this synthesis
   is to ensure layer-by-layer deposition of Ru atoms on the surface of Pd
   cubic seeds by controlling the reaction temperature and the injection
   rate of a Ru(III) precursor. By selectively etching away the Pd from the
   Pd@Ru core-shell nanocubes, we obtain Ru nanocages with an average wall
   thickness of 1.1 nm or about six atomic layers. Most importantly, the Ru
   nanocages adopt an fcc crystal structure rather than the hcp structure
   observed in bulk Ru. The synthesis has been successfully applied to Pd
   cubic seeds with different edge lengths in the range of 618 nm, with
   smaller seeds being more favorable for the formation of Ru shells with a
   flat, smooth surface due to shorter distance for the surface diffusion
   of the Ru adatoms. Self-consistent density functional theory
   calculations indicate that these unique fcc-structured Ru nanocages
   might possess promising catalytic properties for ammonia synthesis
   compared to hcp Ru(0001), on the basis of strengthened binding of atomic
   N and substantially reduced activation energies for N-2 dissociation,
   which is the rate determining step for ammonia synthesis on hcp Ru
   catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We present the framework for wearable joint rehabilitation
   assessment following musculoskeletal injury. We propose a multimodal
   sensing (i.e., contact based and airborne measurement of joint acoustic
   emission) system for at-home monitoring. Methods: We used three types of
   microphones-electret, MEMS, and piezoelectric film microphones-to obtain
   joint sounds in healthy collegiate athletes during unloaded
   flexion/extension, and we evaluated the robustness of each microphone's
   measurements via: 1) signal quality and 2) within-day consistency.
   Results: First, airmicrophones acquired higher quality signals than
   contact microphones (signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio of 11.7 and
   12.4 dB for electret and MEMS, respectively, versus 8.4 dB for
   piezoelectric). Furthermore, air microphones measured similar acoustic
   signatures on the skin and 5 cm off the skin (similar to 4.5x smaller
   amplitude). Second, the main acoustic event during repetitivemotions
   occurred at consistent joint angles (intra-class correlation coefficient
   ICC(1, 1)=0.94 and ICC(1, k)=0.99). Additionally, we found that this
   angular location was similar between right and left legs, with asymmetry
   observed in only a few individuals. Conclusion: We recommend using air
   microphones for wearable joint sound sensing; for practical
   implementation of contact microphones in a wearable device, interface
   noise must be reduced. Importantly, we show that airborne signals can be
   measured consistently and that healthy left and right knees often
   produce a similar pattern in acoustic emissions. Significance: These
   proposed methods have the potential for enabling knee joint acoustics
   measurement outside the clinic/lab and permitting long-term monitoring
   of knee health for patients rehabilitating an acute knee joint injury.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present correlated logistic (CorrLog) model for
   multilabel image classification. CorrLog extends conventional logistic
   regression model into multilabel cases, via explicitly modeling the
   pairwise correlation between labels. In addition, we propose to learn
   the model parameters of CorrLog with elastic net regularization, which
   helps exploit the sparsity in feature selection and label correlations
   and thus further boost the performance of multilabel classification.
   CorrLog can be efficiently learned, though approximately, by regularized
   maximum pseudo likelihood estimation, and it enjoys a satisfying
   generalization bound that is independent of the number of labels.
   CorrLog performs competitively for multilabel image classification on
   benchmark data sets MULAN scene, MIT outdoor scene, PASCAL VOC 2007, and
   PASCAL VOC 2012, compared with the state-of-the-art multilabel

Abstract = {{A direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) is an all-solid-state
   electricity generation device that operates directly with solid carbon
   as fuel, without any liquid medium and feeding gas. Tubular
   electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), with
   silver-gadolinium doped ceria (Ag-GDC) as both anode and cathode
   materials, are fabricated and operated directly with activated carbon as
   fuel. The kinetics of the DC-SOFCs is carried out through analyzing the
   correlations of the cell reaction rates to the emitting rates of CO and
   CO2. It turns out that higher operating current corresponds to higher
   rates of consuming and producing CO, through electrochemical oxidation
   at the anode and the Boudouard reaction at the carbon fuel,
   respectively. The rate of consuming CO can be maintained constant by
   controlling the operating current while the rate of producing CO
   decreases with time because of carbon consumption. When the CO producing
   rate becomes smaller than the CO consuming rate, the operation will be
   terminated. Compared to the rates of the chemical reactions, the
   diffusion rates of CO and CO2 are so fast that their impeding effect on
   the cell performance can be neglected.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are one of the most promising solutions
   for smart grid applications due to advantages, such as their low-cost,
   different functionalities, and successful adoption to smart grid
   environments. However, providing quality of service (QoS) requirements
   of smart grid applications with WSNs is difficult because of the power
   constraints of sensor nodes and harsh smart grid channel conditions,
   such as RF interference, noise, multi-path fading and node contentions.
   To address these communication challenges, in this paper
   link-quality-aware routing algorithm (LQ-CMST) as well as the priority
   and channel-aware multi-channel (PCA-MC) scheduling algorithm have been
   proposed for smart grid applications. Furthermore, the effect of
   different modulation and encoding schemes on the performance of the
   proposed algorithms has been evaluated under harsh smart grid channel
   conditions. Comparative performance evaluations through extensive
   simulations show that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce
   communication delay and the choice of encoding and modulation schemes is
   critical to meet the requirements of envisioned smart grid applications.

Abstract = {{Mobile video chat apps offer users an approachable way to communicate
   with others. As high-speed 4G networks are being deployed worldwide, the
   number of mobile video chat app users increases. However, video chatting
   on mobile devices brings users financial concerns, since streaming video
   demands high bandwidth and can use up a large amount of data in dozens
   of minutes. Lowering the bandwidth usage of mobile video chats is
   challenging since video quality may be compromised. In this paper, we
   attempt to tame this challenge. Technically, we propose a context-aware
   frame rate adaption framework, named low-bandwidth video chat (LBVC). It
   follows a sender-receiver cooperative principle that smartly handles the
   tradeoff between lowering bandwidth usage and maintaining video quality.
   We implement LBVC by modifying an open-source app-Linphone-and evaluate
   it with both objective experiments and subjective studies.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of smart grids has posed great challenges to traditional
   power system control given the multitude of new risk factors. This paper
   proposes an online supplementary learning controller (OSLC) design
   method to compensate the traditional power system controllers for coping
   with the dynamic power grid. The proposed OSLC is a supplementary
   controller based on approximate dynamic programming, which works
   alongside an existing power system controller. By introducing an
   action-dependent cost function as the optimization objective, the
   proposed OSLC is a nonidentifier-based method to provide an online
   optimal control adaptively as measurement data become available. The
   online learning of the OSLC enjoys the policy-search efficiency during
   policy iteration and the data efficiency of the least squares method.
   For the proposed OSLC, the stability of the controlled system during
   learning, the monotonic nature of the performance measure of the
   iterative supplementary controller, and the convergence of the iterative
   supplementary controller are proved. Furthermore, the efficacy of the
   proposed OSLC is demonstrated in a challenging power system frequency
   control problem in the presence of high penetration of wind generation.}},

Abstract = {{Viral product design involves sophisticated interactions between product
   portfolio planning and viral marketing. However, social network effects
   are mainly considered in marketing-related activities, and there is
   still limited investigation of the interplay between product design and
   viral marketing. In the context of social networks, it is important to
   jointly leverage both viral product attributes and viral influence
   attributes for product adoption maximization and product line
   performance optimization. In order to deal with the joint optimization
   problem, this paper presents a systematic formulation of a bilevel
   decision-making strategy for viral product design based on the
   Stackelberg game theory. The product adoption maximization problem with
   viral influence and product attributes is modeled as the leader and the
   product portfolio optimization problem with product attributes is
   modeled as the follower. The interaction and coupling of these two
   optimization problems are addressed with a coordinate-wise optimization
   strategy, in which adoption maximization is tackled with an improved
   greedy algorithm and a hybrid Taguchi genetic algorithm. A case study of
   Kindle Fire HD tablets demonstrates the feasibility and potential of the
   bilevel decision-making strategy for viral product design, which is
   advantageous over the existing viral marketing methods that only
   consider viral influence attributes.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the timescale of thrombotic occlusion in stenotic
   vessels may improve patient risk assessment for thrombotic events. In
   blood contacting devices, thrombosis predictions can lead to improved
   designs to minimize thrombotic risks. We have developed and validated a
   model of high shear thrombosis based on empirical correlations between
   thrombus growth and shear rate. A mathematical model was developed to
   predict the growth of thrombus based on the hemodynamic shear rate. The
   model predicts thrombus deposition based on initial geometric and fluid
   mechanic conditions, which are updated throughout the simulation to
   reflect the changing lumen dimensions. The model was validated by
   comparing predictions against actual thrombus growth in six separate in
   vitro experiments: stenotic glass capillary tubes (diameter = 345 A mu
   m) at three shear rates, the PFA-100(A (R)) system, two microfluidic
   channel dimensions (heights = 300 and 82 A mu m), and a stenotic aortic
   graft (diameter = 5.5 mm). Comparison of the predicted occlusion times
   to experimental results shows excellent agreement. The model is also
   applied to a clinical angiography image to illustrate the time course of
   thrombosis in a stenotic carotid artery after plaque cap rupture. Our
   model can accurately predict thrombotic occlusion time over a wide range
   of hemodynamic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the development of training for effective
   interaction with multi-level automation, i.e., a system that switches
   between functions and roles corresponding to different levels of
   automation. These interactions need to span not only the nominal
   procedures and skills expected of the operator, but also effective
   reasoning about when and whether the automation should be employed. This
   suggests framing the operator's tasks using Rasmussen's classical
   categorization of human behavior as skill based, rule based, or
   knowledge based (SRK), thereby providing appropriate insights into
   appropriate training objectives and methods. This paper uses the
   aircraft traffic alert and collision avoidance system as a case study,
   demonstrating the application of the SRK framework to develop pilot
   training. Comparison of pilot behavior with and without this modified
   training highlights the training's ability to improve interaction with
   the automation, leading to recommendations for broader application of
   the SRK framework in training development.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare the biological effects in vivo
   of hierarchical surface roughness on laser sintered
   titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) implants to those of
   conventionally machined implants on osteoblast response in vitro and
   osseointegration. Laser sintered disks were fabricated to have
   micro-/nano-roughness and wettability. Control disks were computer
   numerical control (CNC) milled and then polished to be smooth (CNC-M).
   Laser sintered disks were polished smooth (LST-M), grit blasted (LST-B),
   or blasted and acid etched (LST-BE). LST-BE implants or implants
   manufactured by CNC milling and grit blasted (CNC-B) were implanted in
   the femurs of male New Zealand white rabbits. Most osteoblast
   differentiation markers and local factors were enhanced on rough LST-B
   and LST-BE surfaces in comparison to smooth CNC-M or LST-M surfaces for
   MG63 and normal human osteoblast cells. To determine if LST-BE implants
   were osteogenic in vivo, we compared them to implant surfaces used
   clinically. LST-BE implants had a unique surface with combined
   micro-/nano-roughness and higher wettability than conventional CNC-B
   implants. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated a significant
   improvement in cortical bone-implant contact of LST-BE implants compared
   to CNC-B implants after 3 and 6 weeks. However, mechanical testing
   revealed no differences between implant pullout forces at those time
   points. LST surfaces enhanced osteoblast differentiation and production
   of local factors in vitro and improved the osseointegration process in
   vivo. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 104A:

Abstract = {{Experiments measuring the leakage rate through hole-pattern seals

   A more detailed investigation via large eddy simulations (LES) suggest
   that the switching from shear layer instability mode to a wake

   performs nearly optimally. The main insight of our work is that when the
   lead time is very large, such a significant amount of randomness is
   injected into the system between when an order for more inventory is
   placed and when the order is received, that ``being smart{''}
   algorithmically provides almost no benefit. Our main proof technique
   combines a novel coupling for suprema of random walks with arguments

   chemistry investment-cast substrates. Optical microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) investigations revealed the presence of
   dendritic microstructures that consisted of fine gamma' precipitates
   within the gamma matrix in the deposit region. Computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD)-based process modeling, statistical design of experiments
   (DoE), and microstructural characterization techniques were combined to
   produce metallurgically bonded single-crystal deposits of more than 500
   mu m height in a single pass along the entire length of the substrate. A
   customized quantitative metallography based image analysis technique was
   employed for automatic extraction of various deposit quality metrics
   from the digital cross-sectional micrographs. The processing parameters
   were varied, and optimal processing windows were identified to obtain
   good quality deposits. The results reported here represent one of the
   few successes obtained in producing single-crystal epitaxial deposits
   through a powder bed fusion-based metal AM process and thus demonstrate
   the potential of SLE to repair and manufacture single-crystal hot
   section components of gas turbine systems from nickel-based superalloy
   powders.}},

Abstract = {{The Monte Carlo N-Particle Version 5 (MCNP5) code system was used to
   create an MCmodel of the head of a Philips RT-250 unit and a 30 x 30 x
   30 cm(3) water phantom. For the x-ray machine head, thisMCmodel includes
   the vacuum region, beryllium window, collimators, inherent filters, and
   exterior steel housing. For increased computational efficiency of MC
   simulations, the primary x-ray spectrum from the target was
   pre-calculated using a well-validated analytical software package. The
   current hybrid MC model was tested for the three common kilovoltage
   x-ray beams available from the machine: 250 kVp (0.35 mm Cu), 125 kVp
   (0.1 mm Cu), and 75 kVp (0.1 mm Cu). Specifically, calculated
   percentage-depth-dose (PDD) values and x-ray spectra were compared with
   experimental data from film/ionization chamber and Compton-scatter
   spectrum measurements, respectively. A comparison between the calculated
   PDD and measured data for all three x-ray beams showed overall agreement
   within 3\%. The measured x-ray spectra were also compared with the MC
   results showing reasonable agreement between the two, in terms of the
   spectral shapes (or effects of filtration on the final spectra). In
   conclusion, despite its simplicity, the current hybrid MC model was
   capable of predicting the dosimetric and spectral characteristics of
   each beam from the RT-250 orthovoltage unit, demonstrating its
   applicability as a convenient and efficient computational tool for
   various preclinical and clinical applications.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the spatial distribution of multiple pollutants and

Journal = {{SPATIAL AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exposure metrics that identify spatial contrasts in
   multipollutant air quality are needed to better understand
   multipollutant geographies and health effects from air pollution. Our
   aim is to improve understanding of: (1) long-term spatial distributions
   of multiple pollutants; and (2) demographic characteristics of
   populations residing within areas of differing air quality.
   Methods: We obtained average concentrations for ten air pollutants (p =
   10) across a 12 km grid (n = 253) covering Atlanta, Georgia for
   2002-2008. We apply a self-organizing map (SOM) to our data to derive
   multipollutant patterns observed across our grid and classify locations
   under their most similar pattern (i.e, multipollutant spatial type
   (MST)). Finally, we geographically map classifications to delineate
   regions of similar multipollutant characteristics and characterize
   associated demographics.
   Results: We found six MSTs well describe our data, with profiles
   highlighting a range of combinations, from locations experiencing
   generally clean air to locations experiencing conditions that were
   relatively dirty. Mapping MSTs highlighted that downtown areas were
   dominated by primary pollution and that suburban areas experienced
   relatively higher levels of secondary pollution. Demographics show the
   largest proportion of the overall population resided in downtown
   locations experiencing higher levels of primary pollution. Moreover,
   higher proportions of nonwhites and children in poverty reside in these
   areas when compared to suburban populations that resided in areas
   exhibiting relatively lower pollution.
   Conclusion: Our approach reveals the nature and spatial distribution of
   differential pollutant combinations across urban environments and
   provides helpful insights for identifying spatial exposure and
   demographic contrasts for future health studies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{With real time resolved data of Particulate matter (PM) and chemical
   species, understanding the source patterns and chemical characteristics
   is critical to establish controlling of PM. In this work, PM2.5 and
   chemical species were measured by corresponding online instruments with
   1-h time resolution in Beijing. Multilinear Engine 2 (ME2) model was
   applied to explore the sources, and four sources (vehicle emission,
   crustal dust, secondary formation and coal combustion) were identified.
   To investigate the sensitivity of time resolution on the source
   contributions and chemical characteristics, ME2 was conducted with four
   time resolution runs (1-h, 2-h, 4-h, and 8-h). Crustal dust and coal
   combustion display large variation in the four time resolutions runs,
   with their contributions ranging from 6.7 to 10.4 mu g m(-3) and from
   6.4 to 12.2 mu g m(-3), respectively. The contributions of vehicle
   emission and secondary formation range from 7.5 to 10.5 and from 14.7 to
   16.7 mu g m(-3), respectively. The sensitivity analyses were conducted
   by principal component analysis-plot (PCA-plot), coefficient of
   divergence (CD), average absolute error (AAE) and correlation
   coefficients. For the four time resolution runs, the source
   contributions and profiles of crustal dust and coal combustion were more
   unstable than other source categories, possibly due to the lack of key
   markers of crustal dust and coal combustion (e.g. Si, Al). On the other
   hand, vehicle emission and crustal dust were more sensitive to time
   series of source contributions at different time resolutions. Findings
   in this study can improve our knowledge of source contributions and
   chemical characteristics at different time solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   metals}},

Abstract = {{In this work a couple stress continuum based elasto-viscoplastic fast
   Fourier transform model is developed with the intent to study the role
   of curvatures gradient of rotation on the local meso scale and effective
   macro scale mechanical response of nanocrystalline materials.
   Development of this model has led to the formulation of an extended
   periodic Lippmann Schwinger equation that accounts for couple stress
   equilibrium. In addition to the standard boundary conditions on strain
   rate and Cauchy stresses, the model allows imposing non-standard couple
   stress and curvature rate boundary conditions. Application to
   representative nanocrystalline microstructures reveals that elastic and
   plastic curvatures accommodate a part of the local and macroscopic
   Cauchy stresses. Next, grain boundary interfaces are characterized using
   curvatures that are representative of their structure and defect
   content. Depending on the magnitude and distribution of these
   curvatures, local stresses in the grain boundary neighborhood are
   generated that activate slip systems besides those fulfilling the Schmid
   criterion. Generation of both polar dislocations and disclinations as a
   possible plasticity mechanism in nanocrystalline materials is explored.
   At the macro scale, this results in a strain rate dependent
   ``softening{''} or the inverse Hall-Petch effect. The modeling framework
   naturally captures this grain size effect without any ad hoc
   assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   shells: two-dimensional elastic bodies whose reference shape is not
   necessarily flat. More generally, morphoelastic shells are elastic
   shells that can remodel and grow in time. These idealized objects are
   suitable models for many physical, engineering, and biological systems.
   Here, we formulate a general geometric theory of nonlinear morphoelastic
   shells that describes both the evolution of the body shape, viewed as an
   orientable surface, as well as its intrinsic material properties such as
   its reference curvatures. In this geometric theory, bulk growth is
   modeled using an evolving referential configuration for the shell, the
   so-called material manifold. Geometric quantities attached to the
   surface, such as the first and second fundamental forms, are obtained
   from the metric of the three-dimensional body and its evolution. The
   governing dynamical equations for the body are obtained from variational
   consideration by assuming that both fundamental forms on the material
   manifold are dynamical variables in a Lagrangian field theory. In the
   case where growth can be modeled by a Rayleigh potential, we also obtain
   the governing equations for growth in the form of kinetic equations
   coupling the evolution of the first and the second fundamental forms
   with the state of stress of the shell. We apply these ideas to obtain
   stress-free growth fields of a planar sheet, the time evolution of a
   morphoelastic circular cylindrical shell subject to time-dependent
   internal pressure, and the residual stress of a morphoelastic planar
   circular shell.}},

Abstract = {{Coagulation is a feasible process to reclaim municipal wastewater,
   however, the role of coagulation in removing effluent organic matter
   (EfOM) from underutilized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has not
   been fully explored. We identified the characteristics of the EfOM from
   a typical underutilized WWTP (i.e., the ratio of actual capacity to
   design capacity is 50\%-70\%), and investigated the performance of
   coagulation on suspended solids (SS) and dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   removal. The effluent could even satisfy the highest national standard
   of China (Class 1 A) for WWTP effluent, as evaluated by the traditional
   parameters such as SS and chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, the DOM
   in the EfOM we studied contained considerable biomass-associated
   products (BAPS), which were dominated by proteins with a molecular
   weight of approximately 150 kDa. In addition, protein also dominated the
   DOM after coagulation. Fulvic acid and humic-like acid organics were
   poorly removed by either AlCl3 or polyaluminum chloride (PAC)
   coagulation, even with a dosage as high as 24 mg Al L-1.
   Biodegradability was very poor, as the ratio of biological oxygen demand
   (BOD5) to COD was less than 0.17. After coagulation the typical BAPs,
   protein and polysaccharide, remained as high as 1.6 mg L-1 and 1.2 mg
   L-1 respectively. In this study we found coagulation was ineffective for
   removal of recalcitrant BAPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{230}},
Pages = {{100-108}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Sodium amide (NaNH2), a readily available strong base, was investigated
   as an efficient reagent for chemical activation of mesoporous carbon
   (MC) in the temperature range of 400-900 degrees C, aiming to enhance
   the CO2 adsorption performance. Total surface area and pore volume of
   the activated MC increase greatly with the activation temperature up to
   700 degrees C and then tend to level off. Small micropores with a
   diameter <1 nm are developed mainly at low temperatures (400-550 degrees
   C) and decrease continuously in volume as the activation temperature
   increases. Nitrogen species are incorporated onto the carbon activated
   at 400 degrees C but completely disappear at higher activation
   temperatures due to poor thermal stability. CO2 adsorption experiments
   illustrated a substantial improvement in capacities at 0 degrees C for
   the NaNH2-activated carbons (6.31 mmol/g at 1 bar and 2.06 mmol/g at
   0.15 bar) in comparison to pristine MC (2.01 mmol/g at 1 bar and 1.00
   mmol/g at 0.15 bar). The low-pressure CO2 capacities are well correlated
   with the volume of small micropores rather than the total micropore
   volume and surface area. The activation ability of NaNH2 was compared
   with those of KOH and NaOH, verifying the superiority of NaNH2 in the MC
   activation under relatively moderate conditions, i.e., activation
   reagent/MC weight ratio of two and activation temperature of 550 degrees

Title = {{Reduced motor neuron excitability is an important contributor to
   weakness in a rat model of sepsis}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{282}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which sepsis triggers intensive care unit acquired
   weakness (ICUAW) remain unclear. We previously identified difficulty
   with motor unit recruitment in patients as a novel contributor to ICUAW.
   To study the mechanism underlying poor recruitment of motor units we
   used the rat cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis. We identified
   striking dysfunction of alpha motor neurons during repetitive firing.
   Firing was more erratic, and often intermittent. Our data raised the
   possibility that reduced excitability of motor neurons was a significant
   contributor to weakness induced by sepsis. In this study we quantified
   the contribution of reduced motor neuron excitability and compared its
   magnitude to the contributions of myopathy, neuropathy and failure of
   neuromuscular transmission. We injected constant depolarizing current
   pulses (5 s) into the soma of alpha motor neurons in the lumbosacral
   spinal cord of anesthetized rats to trigger repetitive firing. In
   response to constant depolarization, motor neurons in untreated control
   rats fired at steady and continuous firing rates and generated smooth
   and sustained tetanic motor unit force as expected. In contrast,
   following induction of sepsis, motor neurons were often unable to
   sustain firing throughout the 5 s current injection such that force
   production was reduced. Even when firing, motor neurons from septic rats
   fired erratically and discontinuously, leading to irregular production
   of motor unit force. Both fast and slow type motor neurons had similar
   disruption of excitability. We followed rats after recovery from sepsis
   to determine the time course of resolution of the defect in motor neuron
   excitability. By one week, rats appeared to have recovered from sepsis
   as they had no piloerection and appeared to be in no distress. The
   defects in motor neuron repetitive firing were still striking at 2 weeks
   and, although improved, were present at one month. We infer that rats
   suffered from weakness due to reduced motor neuron excitability for
   weeks after resolution of sepsis. To assess whether additional
   contributions from myopathy, neuropathy and defects in neuromuscular
   transmission contributed to the reduction in force generation, we
   measured whole-muscle force production in response to electrical
   stimulation of the muscle nerve. We found no abnormality in force
   generation that would suggest the presence of myopathy, neuropathy or
   defective neuromuscular transmission. These data suggest disruption of
   repetitive firing of motor neurons is an important contributor to
   weakness induced by sepsis in rats and raise the possibility that
   reduced motor neuron excitability contributes to disability that
   persists after resolution of sepsis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{102-114}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a hydro-mechanical constitutive model for clayey
   soils accounting for damage plasticity couplings. Specific features of
   unsaturated clays such as confining pressure and suction effects on
   elastic domain and plastic strains are accounted for. A double effective
   stress incorporating both the effect of suction and damage is defined
   based on thermodynamical considerations, which results in a unique
   stress variable being thermodynamically conjugated to elastic strain.
   Coupling between damage and plasticity phenomena is achieved by
   following the principle of strain equivalence and incorporating the
   double effective stress into plasticity equations. Two distinct criteria
   are defined for damage and plasticity, which can be activated either
   independently or simultaneously. Their formulation in terms of effective
   stress and suction allows them to evolve in the total stress space with
   suction and damage changes. This leads to a direct coupling between
   damage and plasticity and allows the model to capture the
   ductile/brittle behaviour transition occurring when clays are drying.
   Model predictions are compared with experimental data on Boom Clay, and
   the flexibility of the model is illustrated by presenting results of
   simulations in which either damage or plasticity dominates the coupled
   behaviour. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{SoftWater: Software-defined networking for next-generation underwater
   communication systems}},
Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Underwater communication systems have drawn the attention of the
   research community in the last 15 years. This growing interest can
   largely be attributed to new civil and military applications enabled by
   large-scale networks of underwater devices (e.g., underwater static
   sensors, unmanned autonomous vehicles (AUVs), and autonomous robots),
   which can retrieve information from the aquatic and marine environment,
   perform in-network processing on the extracted data, and transmit the
   collected information to remote locations. Currently underwater
   communication systems are inherently hardware-based and rely on closed
   and inflexible architectural design. This imposes significant challenges
   into adopting new underwater communication and networking technologies,
   prevent the provision of truly-differentiated services to highly diverse
   underwater applications, and induce great barriers to integrate
   heterogeneous underwater devices. Software-defined networking (SDN),
   recognized as the next-generation networking paradigm, relies on the
   highly flexible, programmable, and virtualizable network architecture to
   dramatically improve network resource utilization, simplify network
   management, reduce operating cost, and promote innovation and evolution.
   In this paper, a software-defined architecture, namely SoftWater, is
   first introduced to facilitate the development of the next-generation
   underwater communication systems. More specifically, by exploiting the
   network function virtualization (NFV) and network virtualization
   concepts, SoftWater architecture can easily incorporate new underwater
   communication solutions, accordingly maximize the network capacity, can
   achieve the network robustness and energy efficiency, as well as can
   provide truly differentiated and scalable networking services.
   Consequently, the SoftWater architecture can simultaneously support a
   variety of different underwater applications, and can enable the
   interoperability of underwater devices from different manufacturers that
   operate on different underwater communication technologies based on
   acoustic, optical, or radio waves. Moreover, the essential network
   management tools of SoftWater are discussed, including reconfigurable
   multi-controller placement, hybrid in-band and out-of band control
   traffic balancing, and utility-optimal network virtualization.
   Furthermore, the major benefits of SoftWater architecture are
   demonstrated by introducing software-defined underwater networking
   solutions, including the throughput-optimal underwater routing,
   SDN-enhanced fault recovery, and software-defined underwater mobility
   management. The research challenges to realize the SoftWater are also
   discussed in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   target and interfering speakers. Two key issues are investigated. First,
   we propose a DNN architecture with dual outputs of the features of both
   the target and interfering speakers, which is shown to achieve a better
   generalization capability than that with output features of only the
   target speaker. Second, we propose using a set of multiple DNNs, each
   intending to be signal-noise-dependent (SND), to cope with the
   difficulty that one single general DNN could not well accommodate all
   the speaker mixing variabilities at different signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) levels. Experimental results on the speech separation challenge
   (SSC) data demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves better
   separation results than other conventional approaches in a supervised or
   semisupervised mode. SND-DNNs could also yield significant performance
   improvements over a general DNN for speech separation in low SNR cases.
   Furthermore, for automatic speech recognition (ASR) following speech
   separation, this purely front-end processing with a single set of
   speaker-independent ASR acoustic models, achieves a relative word error
   rate (WER) reduction of 11.6\% over a state-of-the-art separation and
   recognition system where a complicated joint back-end decoding framework
   with multiple sets of speaker-dependent ASR acoustic models needs to be
   implemented. When speaker-adaptive ASR acoustic models for the target
   speakers are adopted for the enhanced signals, another 12.1\% WER
   reduction over our best speaker-independent ASR system is achieved.}},

Title = {{Toward risk assessment 2.0: Safety supervisory control and model-based
   hazard monitoring for risk-informed safety interventions}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{316-330}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) is a staple in the engineering risk
   community, and it has become to some extent synonymous with the entire
   quantitative risk assessment undertaking. Limitations of PRA continue to
   occupy researchers, and workarounds are often proposed. After a brief
   review of this literature, we propose to address some of PRA's
   limitations by developing a novel framework and analytical tools for
   model-based system safety, or safety supervisory control, to guide
   safety interventions and support a dynamic approach to risk assessment
   and accident prevention. Our work shifts the emphasis from the pervading
   probabilistic mindset in risk assessment toward the notions of danger
   indices and hazard temporal contingency. The framework and tools here
   developed are grounded in Control Theory and make use of the state-space
   formalism in modeling dynamical systems. We show that the use of state
   variables enables the definition of metrics for accident escalation,
   termed hazard levels or danger indices, which measure the
   ``proximity{''} of the system state to adverse events, and we illustrate
   the development of such indices. Monitoring of the hazard levels
   provides diagnostic information to support both on-line and off-line
   safety interventions. For example, we show how the application of the
   proposed tools to a rejected takeoff scenario provides new insight to
   support pilots' go/no-go decisions. Furthermore, we augment the
   traditional state-space equations with a hazard equation and use the
   latter to estimate the times at which critical thresholds for the hazard
   level are (b)reached. This estimation process provides important
   prognostic information and produces a proxy for a time-to-accident
   metric or advance notice for an impending adverse event. The ability to
   estimate these two hazard coordinates, danger index and
   time-to-accident, offers many possibilities for informing system control
   strategies and improving accident prevention and risk mitigation.
   Finally we develop a visualization tool, termed hazard temporal
   contingency map, which dynamically displays the ``coordinates{''} of a
   portfolio of hazards. This tool is meant to support operators'
   situational awareness by providing prognostic information regarding the
   time windows available to intervene before hazardous situations become
   unrecoverable, and it helps decision-makers prioritize attention and
   defensive resources for accident prevention. In this view, emerging
   risks and hazards are dynamically prioritized based on the temporal
   vicinity of their associated accident(s) to being released, not on
   probabilities or combination of probabilities and consequences, as is
   traditionally done (off-line) in PRA.
   This approach offers novel capabilities, complementary to PRA, for
   improving risk assessment and accident prevention. It is hoped that this
   work helps to expand the basis of risk assessment beyond its reliance on
   probabilistic tools, and that it serves to enrich the intellectual
   toolkit of risk researchers and safety professionals. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   sills on Europa}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},

Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{297-313}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Double ridge tectonic features appear prominently and ubiquitously
   across the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa. Previous studies have
   interpreted flanking fractures observed along some of the ridges as
   indicators of stress resulting from the ridge loading and flexing of the
   ice shell above a shallow water body. Here, we investigate a shallow
   water sill emplacement process at a time when the shell is cooling and
   thickening and explore the conditions that would make such a system
   feasible on timescales of ridge formation. Results show that fracture
   initiation and transport of ocean water to shallow depths can
   realistically occur, although horizontal fracturing and sill lifetimes
   prove challenging. Finite element models demonstrate that mechanical
   layering or a fractured shell do not provide enough stress change to
   promote horizontal fracturing, but tidal forcing does result in a small
   amount of turn. Assuming it is possible for a shallow sill to form, a
   sill would convect internally and conduct heat out quickly, resulting in
   a short lifetime in comparison to an estimated flexure timeframe of 100
   kyr suggested required for double ridge formation. Consideration of heat
   transfer and residence in the overlying ice, however, extends the
   flexure timeframe and multiple sill intrusions or replenishment with
   warm ocean water could prolong the effective sill lifetime. Though
   challenges still remain for sill formation at Europa, these analyses
   constrain the potential mechanisms for emplacement and indicate sills
   can act as viable options for supplying the heat needed for surface
   flexure. Further analyses and future missions to Europa will help to
   increase our understanding of these enigmatic processes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In a decentralized two-stage supply chain where a supplier serves a
   retailer who, in turn, serves end customers, operations decisions based
   on local incentives often lead to suboptimal system performance.
   Operating decisions based on local incentives may in such cases lead to
   a lack of system coordination, wherein one party's decisions put the
   other party and/or the system at a disadvantage. While models and
   mechanisms for such problem classes have been considered in the
   literature, little work to date has considered such problems under
   nonstationary demands and fixed replenishment order costs. This paper
   models such two-stage problems as a class of Stackelberg games where the
   supplier announces a set of time-phased ordering costs to the retailer
   over a discrete time horizon of finite length, and the retailer then
   creates an order plan, which then serves as the supplier's demand. We
   provide metrics for characterizing the degree of efficiency (and
   coordination) associated with a solution, and provide a set of easily
   understood and implemented mechanisms that can increase this efficiency
   and reduce the negative impacts of uncoordinated decisions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Spontaneous symmetry breaking instabilities are the most common
   mechanism for how biological, chemical, and physical systems produce
   spatial patterns. Beginning with Turing's original paper, so-called
   lateral inhibition-in which negative feedback has greater spread than
   positive feedback-has been the underlying mechanism for pattern
   formation in biological models. Despite this, there are many biological
   systems that exhibit pattern formation but do not have lateral
   inhibition. In this paper, we present an example of such a system that
   is able to generate robust patterns emerging from a spatially
   homogeneous state. In fact, patterns can arise when there is only
   spatial spread of the activator. Unlike classic Turing pattern
   formation, these patterns arise from a spatially homogeneous oscillation
   rather than from a constant steady state.}},

Abstract = {{The nanometer size of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) and their unique optical
   properties, including size-tunable narrow photoluminescent emission,
   broad absorption, fast photoluminescence decay, and negligible light
   scattering, are ideal features for spectrally tagging the shock response
   of localized regions in highly heterogeneous materials such as
   particulate media. In this work, the time-resolved laser-excited
   photoluminescence response of QDs to shock-compression was investigated
   to explore their utilization as mesoscale sensors for pressure
   measurements and in situ diagnostics during shock loading experiments.
   Laser-driven shock-compression experiments with steady-state shock
   pressures ranging from 2.0 to 13 GPa were performed on nanocomposite
   films of CdTe QDs dispersed in a soft polyvinyl alcohol polymer matrix
   and in a hard inorganic sodium silicate glass matrix. Time-resolved
   photoluminescent emission spectroscopy was used to correlate
   photoluminescence changes with the history of shock pressure and the
   dynamics of the matrix material surrounding the QDs. The results
   revealed pressure-induced blueshifts in emitted wavelength, decreases in
   photoluminescent emission intensity, reductions in peak width, and
   matrix-dependent response times. Data obtained for these QD response
   characteristics serve as indicators for their use as possible
   time-resolved diagnostics of the dynamic shock-compression response of
   matrix materials in which such QDs are embedded as in situ sensors.

Abstract = {{When a particle is introduced into a liquid crystal (LC), it distorts
   the LC director field, leading to new arrangements of the particles.
   This phenomenon is ordinarily studied using >100 nm particles and
   similar to 2 nm mesogens. Usually the particle surface and mesogens are
   chemically distinct, which adds an enthalpic effect, even though the
   more interesting interactions are entropic. To raise the structures to
   the visible regime, while minimizing chemical differences between the
   particle surface and mesogen, silica particles coated with an a-helical
   polypeptide have been prepared and dispersed in lyotropic polypeptide
   LCs. The polypeptide is poly(gamma-stearyl-alpha,L-glutamate) or PSLG.
   To make the particles easy to manipulate and easy to find, the silica
   core included superparamagnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) and covalently
   attached dye. Two methods were used to place polypeptides on these
   magnetic, fluorescent particles: a multistep grafting-to approach in
   which whole polypeptides were grafting-from approach in which the
   polymerization of the monomers was initiated from the particle surface.
   These approaches resulted in sparse and dense surface coverages,
   respectively. The influence of surface curvature and polypeptide
   molecular weight on the design of sparsely covered particles was
   investigated using the grafting-to approach. The aggregated
   grafting-from particles when freshly dispersed in a PSLG/solvent matrix
   disrupted the orientation of the characteristic cholesteric LC (ChLC)
   phase directors. In time, the hybrid particles were expelled from some
   domains, enabling the return of the familiar helical twist of the
   cholesteric mesophase. The sparsely coated grafting-to hybrid particles
   when inserted in the PSLG/solvent matrix assembled into stable
   islet-like formations that could not be disrupted even by an external
   magnetic field. The bulk particles aligned in chains that were easily
   manipulated by a magnetic field. These results indicate that polypeptide
   ChLCs can control and facilitate colloidal assembly of particles with
   matching surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound has been studied as a promising tool for intracellular gene
   delivery. In this work, we studied gene transfection of a human prostate
   cancer cell line exposed tomegahertz pulsed ultrasound in the presence
   of contrast agent and assessed the efficiency of fluorescently labelled
   DNA delivery into cell nuclei, which is necessary for gene transfection.
   At the sonication conditions studied, similar to 30\% of cells showed
   DNA uptake 30 min after sonication, but that fraction decreased over
   time to similar to 10\% of cells after 24 h. Most cells containing DNA
   had DNA in their nuclei, but the amount varied significantly.
   Transfection efficiency peaked at similar to 10\% at 8 h post
   sonication. Among those cells containing DNA, similar to 30\% of DNA was
   localized in the cell nuclei, similar to 30\% was in
   autophagosomes/autophagolysosomes and the remainder was ``free{''} in
   the cytoplasm 30 min after sonication. At later times up to 24 h,
   similar to 30\% of DNA continued to be found in the nuclei and most or
   all of the rest of the DNA was in autophagosomes/autophagolysosomes.
   These results demonstrate that ultrasound can deliver DNA into cell
   nuclei shortly after sonication and that the rest of the DNA can be
   cleared by autophagosomes/autophagolysosomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The ability to enhance the specific capacity of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) is of
   practical significance and offers the opportunity to increase the energy
   density of a full LTO-based battery. Widening the discharge cutoff
   voltage to 0 V is an effective way to increase the capacity of LTO at
   low current density. However, whether the specific capacity of LTO at
   large current rates can be enhanced remains largely unknown. Herein,
   intriguingly, we found that, when cycled down to 0 V (i.e., from 1.0-2.5
   to 0-25 V), LTO exhibited greatly enhanced specific capacity at low
   rates (<5 C), while it showed a rapid capacity fading and a greatly
   increased charge/discharge potential gap at high rates (>10 C). The
   decreased lithium-ion diffusion caused by extra lithium-ion
   intercalation together with increased internal impedance significantly
   enhances the polarization and reduces the electrochemical reaction
   kinetics, which, in turn, hinders the lithiation reaction from LTO to
   Li7Ti5O12 and further to Li9Ti5O12.}},

Abstract = {{To use zirconia (ZrO2) as an efficient environmental adsorbent, it can
   be impregnated on a support to improve its physical properties and lower
   the overall cost. In this study, ZrO2 embedded in carbon nanowires
   (ZCNs) is fabricated via an electrospinning method to remove arsenic
   (As) from water. The maximum adsorption capacity values of As(III) and
   As(V) on the ZCNs are 28.61 and 106.57 mg/g, respectively, at 40 degrees
   C. These capacities are considerably higher than those of pure ZrO2
   (2.56 and 3.65 mg/g for As(III) and As(V), respectively) created using
   the same procedure as for the ZCNs. Meanwhile, the adsorption behaviors
   of As(III) and As(V) on the ZCNs are endothermic and pH dependent and
   follow the Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-first-order kinetic
   model. Both As(III) and As(V) are chemisorbed onto the ZCNs, which is
   confirmed by a partial density of state (PDOS) analysis and
   Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) model calculations. Furthermore, the ZCNs
   also possess the capability to enhance or catalyze the oxidation process
   of As(III) to As(V) using dissolved oxygen. This result is confirmed by
   a batch experiment, XPS analysis and Mulliken net charge analysis.
   Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the different
   configurations of As(III) and As(V) complexes on the tetragonal ZrO2
   (t-ZrO2)(III) and monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2)(III) planes, respectively.
   The adsorption energy (E-ad) of As(V) is higher than that of As(III) on
   both the tZrO(2)(III) and m-ZrO2 (III) planes (3.38 and 1.90 eV,
   respectively, for As(V) and 0.37 and 0.12 eV, respectively, for
   As(III)).}},

Abstract = {{Wearable strain sensors with excellent stretchability and sensitivity
   have emerged as a very promising field which could be used for human
   motion detection and biomechanical systems, etc. Three-dimensional (3D)
   graphene foam (GF) has been reported before for high-performance strain
   sensors, however, some problems such as high cost preparation, low
   sensitivity, and stretchability still remain. In this paper, we report a
   highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensor based on 3D GF and
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite. The GF is prepared by assembly
   process from graphene oxide via a facile and scalable method and
   possesses excellent mechanical property which facilitates the
   infiltration of PDMS prepolymer into the graphene framework. The
   as-prepared strain sensor can be stretched as high as 30\% of its
   original length and the gauge factor of this sensor is as high as 98.66
   under 5\% of applied strain. Moreover, the strain sensor shows long-term
   stability in 200 cycles of stretching relaxing. Implementation of the
   device for monitoring the bending of elbow and finger results in
   reproducibility and various responses in the form of resistance change.
   Thus, the developed strain sensors exhibit great application potential
   in fields of biomechanical systems and human-interactive applications.}},

Abstract = {{Both known and new CC3-based porous organic cages are prepared and
   exposed to acidic SO2 in vapor and liquid conditions. Distinct
   differences in the stability of the CC3 cages exist depending on the
   chirality of the diamine linkers used. The acid catalyzed CC3
   degradation mechanism is probed via in situ IR and a degradation pathway
   is proposed and supported with computational results. CC3 crystals
   synthesized with racemic mixtures of diaminocyclohexane exhibited
   enhanced stability compared to CC3-R and CC3-S. Confocal fluorescent
   microscope images reveal that the stability difference in CC3 species

Abstract = {{Recently, a methodology for fabricating polycrystalline metal-organic
   framework (MOF) membranes has been introduced - referred to as
   interfacial microfluidic membrane processing - which allows
   parallelizable fabrication of MOF membranes inside polymeric hollow
   fibers of microscopic diameter. Such hollow fiber membranes, when
   bundled together into modules, are an attractive way to scale molecular
   sieving membranes. The understanding and engineering of fluidic
   processing techniques for MOF membrane fabrication are in their infancy.
   Here, a detailed mechanistic understanding of MOF (ZIF-8) membrane
   growth under microfluidic conditions in polyamide-imide hollow fibers is
   reported, without any intermediate steps (such as seeding or surface
   modification) or post-synthesis treatments. A key finding is that
   interfacial membrane formation in the hollow fiber occurs via an initial
   formation of two distinct layers and the subsequent rearrangement into a
   single layer. This understanding is used to show how nonisothermal
   processing allows fabrication of thinner (5 mu m) ZIF-8 films for higher
   throughput, and furthermore how engineering the polymeric hollow fiber
   support microstructure allows control of defects in the ZIF-8 membranes.
   The performance of these engineered ZIF-8 membranes is then
   characterized, which have H-2/C3H8 and C3H6/C3H8 mixture separation
   factors as high as 2018 and 65, respectively, and C3H6 permeances as
   high as 66 GPU.}},

Title = {{A new model reference control architecture: Stability, performance, and
   robustness}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a new model reference control architecture to
   effectively suppress system uncertainties and achieve a guaranteed
   transient and steady-state system performance. Unlike traditional robust
   control frameworks, only a parameterization of the system uncertainty
   given by unknown weights with known conservative bounds is needed to
   stabilize uncertain dynamical systems with predictable system
   performance. In addition, the proposed architecture's performance is not
   dependent on the level of conservatism of the bounds of system
   uncertainty. Following the same train of thought as adaptive controllers
   that modify a given reference system to improve system performance, the
   proposed method is inspired by a recently developed command governor
   theory that minimizes the effect of system uncertainty by augmenting the
   input signal of the uncertain dynamical and reference systems.
   Specifically, a dynamical system, called a command governor, is designed
   such that its output is used to modify the input of both the controlled
   uncertain dynamical and reference systems. It is theoretically shown
   that if the command governor design parameter is judiciously selected,
   then the controlled system approximates the given original, unmodified
   reference system. The proposed approach is advantageous over model
   reference adaptive control approaches because linearity of the uncertain
   dynamical system is preserved through linear control laws, and hence,
   the closed-loop performance is predictable for different command
   spectrums. Additionally, it is shown that the architecture can be
   modified for robustness improvements with respect to high frequency
   content due to, for example, measurement noise. Modifications can also
   be made in order to accommodate actuator dynamics and retain closed-loop
   stability and predictable performance. The main contribution of this
   paper is the rigorous analysis of the stability and performance of a
   system utilizing the command governor framework. A numerical example is
   provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

Abstract = {{Removal of toxic polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons (PCAHs) with
   cheap, efficient, and environmentally friendly catalysts has long been
   considered a challenging issue. We synthesized novel catalysts which
   were made from CaCO3/Fe2O3 nanorods. These catalysts oxidized PCAHs and
   were characterized using numerous analytical techniques. The catalytic
   activity was evaluated using 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), as a model
   PCAH compound. The results demonstrated that the catalyst (FeCa3) with
   2.8 mol\% Ca-doping shows superior catalytic activity, with the complete
   o-DCB oxidization at a lower temperature (350 degrees C) than other
   reported CaCO3/alpha-Fe2O3 nanocomposites (450 degrees C). Also, we
   demonstrated that the catalytic activity and stability increased in the
   presence of water vapor which differs from previous studies. We
   attribute the excellent catalytic activity to the unique surface
   morphology and interfacial microstructure composed of CaCO3,and
   alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods, which play a crucial role in enhancing catalytic
   activity and stability in a humid atmosphere. The intermediates
   (formate, acetate, and maleate) and final products (CO2 and H2O) were
   monitored by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. In summary, we demonstrated that
   our CaCO3/Fe2O3 nanorod catalysts are promising catalysts for the
   oxidation of PCAHs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of measures of sequence similarity are being based on
   some underlying notion of relative compressibility. Within this
   paradigm, similar sequences are expected to share a large number of
   common substrings, or subsequences, or more complex patterns or motifs,

   and studied in which patterns in a pair are considered similar if they
   coincide up to a preset number of mismatches, that is, within a bounded
   Hamming distance. It is shown here that for some such measures bounds
   are achievable that are slightly better than O(n(2)). Preliminary
   experiments demonstrate the potential applicability to phylogeny and
   classification of these similarity measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All
