Abstract = {{We consider the situation in which a transmitter attempts to communicate
   reliably over a discrete memoryless channel, while simultaneously
   ensuring covertness (low probability of detection) with respect to a
   warden, who observes the signals through another discrete memoryless
   channel. We develop a coding scheme based on the principle of channel
   resolvability, which generalizes and extends prior work in several
   directions. First, it shows that irrespective of the quality of the
   channels, it is possible to communicate on the order of root n reliable
   and covert bits over n channel uses if the transmitter and the receiver
   share on the order of root n key bits. This improves upon earlier
   results requiring on the order of root n log n key bits. Second, it
   proves that if the receiver's channel is better than the warden's
   channel in a sense that we make precise, it is possible to communicate
   on the order of root n reliable and covert bits over n channel uses
   without a secret key. This generalizes earlier results established for
   binary symmetric channels. We also identify the fundamental limits of
   covert and secret communications in terms of the optimal asymptotic
   scaling of the message size and key size, and we extend the analysis to
   Gaussian channels. The main technical problem that we address is how to
   develop concentration inequalities for low-weight sequences. The crux of
   our approach is to define suitably modified typical sets that are
   amenable to concentration inequalities.}},

   the channels. The price paid for these extensions is that the encoder

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of tier-to-tier interface circuits for
   3-D-ICs, where different tiers may operate at different voltages and/or

   tier-to-tier interface circuit are discussed. The footprint, power, and
   performance of the interface are analyzed considering the effects of
   tier-to-tier process variations in 3-D-ICs and technology scaling. The
   simulation results show that dividing the interface circuit evenly
   between two tiers reduces footprint but increases power dissipation. For
   heterogeneous systems with different voltages for reading and writing
   tiers, dividing the interface between tiers provides better performance
   than the worst case scenario. On the other hand, placing the interface
   circuit in the reading tier maximizes throughput for a homogeneous
   system where both tiers operate at the same voltage. In advanced CMOS
   nodes, placing interface circuit in the reading tier is a better option
   due to high delay of the level shifters.}},

Abstract = {{Through-silicon-via (TSV)-to-TSV coupling is a new phenomenon in 3-D
   ICs, and it becomes a significant source of signal integrity problems.
   The existing studies on its extraction and analysis, however, become
   inaccurate when handling more than two TSVs on full-chip scale. In this
   paper, we investigate the multiple TSV-to-TSV coupling issue and propose
   a model that can be efficiently used for full-chip extraction. Then, we
   perform an analysis on the impact of TSV parasitics on coupling and
   delay. Unlike the common belief that only the closest neighboring TSVs
   affect the victim, this paper shows that nonneighboring aggressors also
   cause nonnegligible coupling noise. Based on these observations, we
   propose an effective method of reducing the overall coupling level.}},

   according to the procedure of International Union of Railways, showed
   that the coefficient of friction (mu) was about 0.32 and not sensitive
   to the brake speeds. After four times of emergency stops, the linear
   wear rate of the C/C-SiC pads was 0.481 cm(3)/MJ. The C/C-SiC brake
   pairs of vehicle were tested with inertia dynamometer according to SAE's

Title = {{Enhanced Crack Segmentation Algorithm Using 3D Pavement Data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Automatic pavement crack segmentation has gained attention among
   researchers and transportation agencies over the past two decades.
   However, most existing algorithms using two-dimensional (2D) pavement
   intensity images cannot provide a satisfactory performance. With the
   advent of sensing technology, three-dimensional (3D) line laser pavement
   imaging systems have become available. The objective of this paper is to
   propose an enhanced dynamic optimization algorithm employing the
   advantages of 3D pavement data to improve crack segmentation. The
   proposed algorithm consists of three major stages. First, a two-step
   Gaussian filter is applied to remove outliers from the collected laser
   data and rectify the profile in order to reduce the influence of
   cross-slope and ruts on crack segmentation. Then, a rough crack
   segmentation stage is conducted to adaptively identify the crack regions
   of interest. Finally, a bounding box and major orientation for each
   valid crack region of interest will provide searching space and
   direction for the precise crack segmentation using the dynamic
   optimization algorithm. Experimental tests were conducted using actual
   pavement data collected near Savannah, Georgia. The four most common
   types of pavement cracking (longitudinal, transverse, block, and
   alligator cracking), as well as distress-free pavements, are tested, and
   the performance between original dynamic optimization algorithm and the
   proposed algorithm is compared. Experimental results show that the
   proposed algorithm take only about 1/4 of the average computation time
   of the original algorithm. Also, the accuracy of crack segmentation has
   been improved since the proposed algorithm removes the unnecessary false
   positives and handles cracks in multiple directions better. Finally,
   conclusions are drawn, and recommendations for future research are
   discussed. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Price Adjustment Clauses and Submitted Bid Prices for Major Asphalt Line
   Items in Highway Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Unprecedented uncertainty in the price of asphalt cement over the last
   decade has been a source of major concern for state departments of
   transportation (state DOTs) and highway contractors. This uncertainty
   may lead to price speculation and inflated bid prices by highway
   contractors, in order to secure their financial positions against
   possible rising prices. One of the most common risk-sharing strategies
   widely used by transportation agencies is price adjustment clauses
   (PACs) that shift potential upside and downside risk of material prices
   from contractors to owners. PACs are aimed at eliminating extra risk
   premiums and therefore reducing contractors' submitted bid prices.
   However, the actual effect of offering PACs on submitted bid prices for
   major asphalt line items has not been empirically studied. The research
   objective of this paper is to examine the effect of PACs offered by
   state DOTs on the variations of contractors' submitted bid prices for
   major asphalt line items. Data on 841 transportation projects were
   collected and several potential explanatory variables, such as duration
   of the project, asphalt cement price index, number of bidders, and
   eligibility for the PAC program were identified. Multivariate regression
   analysis was used to create appropriate statistical models that can
   explain the variations of contractors' submitted bid prices for five
   major asphalt line items. The results indicate that eligibility for the
   PAC program was not a statistically significant variable in most of the
   models. Thus, no evidence was found to support the statement that

Abstract = {{This research studies a substructure finite element model updating
   approach that requires vibration data from only part of a large

   model, physical parameters in the substructure and modal parameters of
   the residual structure are chosen as optimization variables;
   minimization of modal dynamic residuals from the eigenvalue equations in
   structural dynamics is chosen as the optimization objective. An
   iterative linearization procedure is adopted for efficiently solving the

Abstract = {{Simultaneous density and velocity turbulence statistics for Rayleigh
   Taylor-driven flows at a moderately high Atwood number (A(t)) of 0.73
   +/- 0.02 arc obtained using a new convective type or statistically
   steady gas tunnel facility. Air and air-helium mixture are used as
   working fluids to create a density difference in this facility, with a
   thin splitter plate separating the two streams flowing parallel to each
   other at the same velocity (U=3 m s(-1)). At the end of the splitter
   plate, the two miscible fluids arc allowed to mix and the instability
   develops. Visualization and Mie-scattering techniques are used to obtain
   structure shape, volume fraction profile and mixing height growth
   information. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and hot-wire techniques
   are used to measure planar and point-wise velocity statistics in the
   developing mixing layer. Asymmetry is evident in the flow field from the
   Mie-scattering images, with the spike side showing a more gradual
   decline in volume fraction than the bubble side. The spike side of the
   mixing layer grows 50\% faster than the bubble side. PIV is implemented
   for the first time in these moderately high-Atwood-number experiments
   (A(t) > 0.1) to obtain root-mean-square velocities, anisotropy tensor
   components and Reynolds stresses across the mixing layer. Overall, the
   turbulence statistics measured have shown different scaling compared to
   small-Atwood-number experiments. However, the total probability density
   functions for the velocities and turbulent mass fluxes exhibit behaviour
   similar to small-Atwood-number experiments. Conditional statistics
   reveal different values for turbulence statistics for spikes and
   bubbles, unlike small-Atwood-number experiments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{985-995}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many towed systems consist of a parent platform moving along the ground,
   air, or water surface connected to a towed vehicle via a tether line.
   Motion of a towed parafoil system can be complex and is driven by motion
   of the parent platform, canopy control inputs, and wind disturbances.
   Aparticularly problematic flight dynamic instability for this system is
   canopy lockout, in which the canopy attains a large lateral offset and
   bank angle resulting in high line tension. It is possible to use left
   and right brakes to return the system to its nominal position; however,
   if the lateral offset and bank angle are too large, it is not possible
   to restore the system to a nominal position, and the lateral offset and
   bank angle grows until impact with a ground surface. This paper explores
   the lockout phenomena using a multibody simulation and identifies
   passive means to avoid the instability by locating the tether connection
   point forward on the cradle in combination with sufficiently high
   cradle-canopy yaw stiffness. Moreover, it is shown that an active
   control system that regulates canopy roll angle with parafoil brake
   inputs can eliminate the instability for the tested configuration.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Clathrate hydrates exhibit unique intermolecular interactions between
   host-guest and guest-guest molecules because they have 3-dimensional
   superstructures consisting of the sublattices created by hydrogen-bonded
   water molecules that form cage-like frameworks in which guest molecules
   can be incorporated. Lattice engineering or molecular engineering using
   a selective injection of specific guest molecules into these sublattices
   can be exploited to tune the physicochemical properties of guest
   molecules or to create new functional materials. Here, we report
   distinctive intermolecular behavior of oxygen molecules that are
   selectively inserted in a structure-II type superstructure consisting of
   a tetrahedral sublattice by the small 5(12) water cages and a
   diamond-like sublattice by the large 5(12)6(4) cages. Pure O-2 clathrate
   hydrate and binary THF+O-2 clathrate hydrate were synthesized, and their
   magnetism and heat capacity were measured at low temperature conditions.
   These results strongly suggest that the magnetic property of the oxygen
   molecule is largely varied with the formation of a 3-dimensional
   superstructure by the injection of O-2 into the water frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that embedded DRAM (eDRAM) is a promising
   approach for 3D stacked last level caches (LLCs) rather than SRAM due to
   its advantages over SRAM; (i) eDRAM occupies less area than SRAM due to
   its smaller bit cell size; and (ii) eDRAM has much less leakage power
   and access energy than SRAM, since it has much smaller number of
   transistors than SRAM. However, different from SRAM cells, eDRAM cells
   should be refreshed periodically in order to retain the data. Since
   refresh operations consume noticeable amount of energy, it is important
   to adopt appropriate refresh interval, which is highly dependent on the
   temperature. However, the conventional refresh method assumes the
   worst-case temperature for all eDRAM stacked cache banks, resulting in
   unnecessarily frequent refresh operations. In this paper, we propose a
   novel temperature-aware refresh scheme for 3D stacked eDRAM caches. Our
   proposed scheme dynamically changes refresh interval depending on the
   temperature of eDRAM stacked last-level cache (LLC). Compared to the
   conventional refresh method, our proposed scheme reduces the number of
   refresh operations of the eDRAM stacked LLC by 28.5\% (on 32 MB eDRAM
   LLC), on average, with small area overhead. Consequently, our proposed
   scheme reduces the overall eDRAM LLC energy consumption by 12.5\% (on 32
   MB eDRAM LLC), on average. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, piezoelectric ZnO microwire was utilized to form
   heterojunctions with perovskite as flexible photovoltaic devices, and
   has a power conversion efficiency of 0.0216\%. By employing the
   piezo-phototronic effect, the strain-induced piezoelectric polarization
   charges at the vicinity of ZnO/perovskite interface can modulate the
   transport and separation processes of photo-generated carriers within
   the photovoltaic device and enhance the performances of ZnO/perovskite

   improved by 25.42\%, 629.47\% and 1280\% (from 0.0216\% to 0.298\%)
   through piezo-phototronic effect, respectively. Physical working
   mechanism behind the observed results was carefully investigated by

Abstract = {{Technology for enabling drug delivery with precise control is strongly
   demanded by patients with diabetes or other chronic diseases. More
   intelligent functions such as drug loading and delivery in controllable
   manner without requiring electrical power will make low-cost drug
   delivery patches come true. One of the promising candidates is
   triboelectric technology which has been deployed as nanogenerators and
   self-powered glucose sensors recently. In this paper, the drug delivery
   is triggered by finger-pressing on a polymer based micropump.
   Considering that the finger-pressing should be an action of very low
   frequency, e.g., 1 to 2 Hz, triboelectric energy harvester (TEH) based
   on contact-separation mode between patterned biocompatible polymer layer
   and Aluminum (Al) film is integrated with microneedles on a flexible
   skin patch. Leveraging triboelectric materials and compatible
   fabrication technology, we successfully develop a self-powered flexible
   skin patch for transdermal insulin delivery with novel liquid volume
   sensor to monitor delivered drug volume and flexible energy harvester
   using the same triboelectric mechanism. With 3stacked polymer layers,
   the TEH of 2 x 2 cm(2) area generates 33 mu W by gentle finger tapping
   at 2 Hz. Such energy could be harvested even during drug delivery via
   finger pressing. In future we can further store harvested energy in a
   battery to provide required operation power for other active components
   or glucose sensors integrated in this skin patch. The developed flexible
   skin patch for transdermal drug delivery is further validated by in vivo
   experiments in rats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Cell function depends on tissue rigidity, which cells probe by applying
   and transmitting forces to their extracellular matrix, and then
   transducing them into biochemical signals. Here we show that in response
   to matrix rigidity and density, force transmission and transduction are
   explained by the mechanical properties of the
   actin-talin-integrin-fibronectin clutch. We demonstrate that force
   transmission is regulated by a dynamic clutch mechanism, which unveils
   its fundamental biphasic force/rigidity relationship on talin depletion.
   Force transduction is triggered by talin unfolding above a stiffness
   threshold. Below this threshold, integrins unbind and release force
   before talin can unfold. Above the threshold, talin unfolds and binds to
   vinculin, leading to adhesion growth and YAP nuclear translocation.
   Matrix density, myosin contractility, integrin ligation and talin
   mechanical stability differently and nonlinearly regulate both force
   transmission and the transduction threshold. In all cases, coupling of
   talin unfolding dynamics to a theoretical clutch model quantitatively
   predicts cell response.}},

Abstract = {{Energy recovery is widely considered an important part of hierarchy of
   waste management. Previously, researchers have primarily focused on
   cost-effectiveness analysis of solid waste management, ignoring the
   global warming potential (GWP) impacts. By integrating greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions and the cost-benefit analysis, we analyzed the
   cost-benefit of GHG emissions for two waste to energy (WtE) methods:
   incineration with combined heat and power (ICHP) which produces
   electricity and heat, and landfill disposal with landfill gas
   utilization (LGU). We calculated both costs and benefits per ton
   certified GHG emission reductions (CER) for 20 clean development
   mechanism (CDM) projects with WtE technology in typical northern and
   southern cities in China. Furthermore, benefits were analyzed under two
   different scenarios: benefit only from recovery energy revenues; benefit
   from recovery energy revenues plus gate fee revenues. The results show
   that: (1) ICHP projects are beneficial from the GHG reduction
   standpoint; (2) The ratio of CER revenues to benefit is very high during
   2008-2011. However, the decrease of CER price in CDM projects causes the
   disposal gate fee from local government to become more and more
   important for these two WtE technologies, especially for LGU. However,
   with or without the CDM, there is still a huge GHG reduction potential
   in solid waste management in China. Policies should be developed to
   facilitate and encourage WtE, and the selection of WtE method depends on
   geographical region and economics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A widening gap exists between the best practices for RNA secondary
   structure prediction developed by computational researchers and the
   methods used in practice by experimentalists. Minimum free energy
   predictions, although broadly used, are outperformed by methods which
   sample from the Boltzmann distribution and data mine the results. In
   particular, moving beyond the single structure prediction paradigm
   yields substantial gains in accuracy. Furthermore, the largest
   improvements in accuracy and precision come from viewing secondary
   structures not at the base pair level but at lower granularity/higher
   abstraction. This suggests that random errors affecting precision and
   systematic ones affecting accuracy are both reduced by this `fuzzier'
   view of secondary structures. Thus experimentalists who are willing to
   adopt a more rigorous, multilayered approach to secondary structure
   prediction by iterating through these levels of granularity will be much
   better able to capture fundamental aspects of RNA base pairing. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Endometriosis is a gynecologic disease characterized by the ectopic
   presence of endometrial tissue on organs within the peritoneal cavity,
   causing debilitating abdominal pain and infertility. Current treatments
   alleviate moderate pain symptoms associated with the disorder but
   exhibit limited ability to prevent new or recurring lesion establishment
   and growth. Retrograde menstruation has been implicated for introducing
   endometrial tissue into the peritoneal cavity, but molecular mechanisms
   underlying attachment and invasion are not fully understood. We
   hypothesize that cysteine cathepsins, a group of powerful extracellular
   matrix proteases, facilitate endometrial tissue invasion and
   endometriosis lesion establishment in the peritoneal wall and inhibiting
   this activity would decrease endometriosis lesion implantation. To test
   this, we used an immunocompetent endometriosis mouse model and found
   that endometriotic lesions exhibited a greater than 5-fold increase in
   active cathepsins compared to tissue from peritoneal wall or eutopic
   endometrium, with cathepsins L and K specifically implicated. Human
   endometriosis lesions also exhibited greater cathepsin activity than
   adjacent peritoneum tissue, supporting the mouse results. Finally, we
   tested the hypothesis that inhibiting cathepsin activity could block
   endometriosis lesion attachment and implantation in vivo.
   Intraperitoneal injection of the broad cysteine cathepsin inhibitor,
   E-64, significantly reduced the number of attached endometriosis lesions
   in our murine model compared to vehicle-treated controls demonstrating
   that cathepsin proteases contribute to endometriosis lesion
   establishment, and their inhibition may provide a novel, nonhormonal
   therapy for endometriosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nanomaterials (NMs) are often exposed to a broad range of
   biomolecules of different abundances. Biomolecule sorption driven by
   various interfacial forces determines the surface structure and
   composition of NMs, subsequently governs their functionality and the
   reactivity of the adsorbed biomolecules. Isothermal titration
   calorimetry (ITC) is a nondestructive technique that quantifies
   thermodynamic parameters through in-situ measurement of the heat
   absorption or release associated with an interaction.
   Scope of review: This review highlights the recent applications of ITC
   in understanding the thermodynamics of interactions between various
   nanoparticles (NPs) and biomolecules. Different aspects of a typical ITC
   experiment that are crucial for obtaining accurate and meaningful data,
   as well as the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of ITC applications
   to NP research were discussed.
   Major conclusions: ITC reveals the driving forces behind biomolecule-NP
   interactions and the effects of the physicochemical properties of both
   NPs and biomolecules by quantifying the crucial thermodynamics
   parameters (e.g., binding stoichiometry, Delta H, Delta S, and Delta G).
   Complimentary techniques would strengthen the interpretation of ITC
   results for a more holistic understanding of biomolecule-NP
   interactions.
   General significance: The thermodynamic information revealed by ITC and
   its complimentary characterizations is important for understanding
   biomolecule-NP interactions that are fundamental to the biomedical and
   environmental applications of NMs and their toxicological effects. This
   article is part of a Special Issue entitled Microcalorimetry in the
   BioSciences - Principles and Applications, edited by Fadi Bou-Abdallah.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{25-34}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a probability model to predict the maximum rotation
   of rocking bodies exposed to seismic excitations given particular
   earthquake intensity measures. After obtaining the nonlinear equations
   of motion and a clarification of the boundaries applied to a rocking
   body needed to avoid sliding, a complete discussion is provided for the
   estimation of the approximate period and equivalent damping ratio for
   the rocking motion. After that, instead of using an iterative solution,
   which has been proven defective, a new approximate technique is
   developed by finding the best representative ground motion intensities.
   Suitable transformations and normalizations are applied to these
   intensities, and the Bayesian updating approach is employed to construct
   a probability model. The proposed probability model is capable of
   accurately predicting the maximum rotation of a symmetric rocking block
   given the displacement design spectra, peak ground acceleration, peak
   ground velocity, and arias intensity of an earthquake. This
   probabilistic model along with the approximate capacity of rocking
   blocks are used to estimate the fragility curves for rocking blocks with
   specific geometrical parameters. In the end, a comprehensive and
   practical form of fragility curves are provided for design purposes
   along with numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The geometrical non-linear behavior a curved sandwich panel with a stiff
   or compliant core when subjected to a pressure load using the Extended
   High-Order Sandwich Panel theory (EHSAPT), is presented. The formulation
   follows the EHSAPT procedure where the in-plane. i.e circumferential
   rigidity of the core is considered and the distribution of the
   displacements through the depth of the core are presumed. These
   displacement distributions are the closed-form solutions of the 2D
   governing equations of the curved core without circumferential rigidity

   formulation includes the field equations along with the appropriate
   boundary and continuity conditions that take into account the high-order
   stress resultants in the core due to the presumed distributions. Finally
   a numerical study is conducted for a panel loaded by a distributed
   pressure at the upper face sheet. It reveals that the post-buckling
   response of a curved sandwich panels is associated with shallow to deep
   wrinkling deformations of the upper face sheet in the case of a simply
   supported panel or a general non-linear pattern without wrinkles in the
   case of pinned supports with a short span. In both cases a stable
   post-buckling response is observed similar to that of a plate one. (C)

Abstract = {{Hollow cobalt ferrite polyaniline nanofibers (CoFe2O4-PANI) functioning
   as a photocatalyst were prepared by using electrospinning technique,
   followed by calcination and in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization.
   The hollow CoFe2O4-PANI nanofibers with one dimensional (1D) structure
   provide well developed mesoporous structure and enhanced electrical
   conductivity. The hollow CoFe2O4-PANI nanofibers consisted of hollow
   core-double shell nanostructure, which has CoFe2O4 as inner shell and
   PANI as outer shell. The hollow CoFe2O4-PANI nanofibers coated with PANI
   nanograins facilitate the optical properties by easily capturing visible
   light. The intensive visible light absorption and effective charge
   separation lead to a remarkable improvement of visible light
   photocatalysis owing to the heterojunction built between CoFe2O4 and
   PANI. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constant of photo catalytic
   degradation of the methyl orange (MO) dye under visible light
   irradiation with CoFe2O4-PANI was 80 times greater than CoFe2O4. This
   evidence shows the advantage of the unique core shell mesoporous
   structure in the CoFe2O4-PANI for efficient photocatalysis. The recovery
   ratio is almost the same after three cycles under visible light
   irradiation, displaying the excellent characteristics of magnetic
   separation for CoFe2O4-PANI hollow nanofibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Fraser fir (Abies fraseri {[}Pursh] Poir.) is a coniferous species
   native to the Southern Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United
   States. The species has high economic and recreational value but is
   vulnerable to extinction due to introduced pests and global warming.
   Somatic embryogenesis technology may assist in the clonal production of
   desired lines of Christmas trees and safekeeping of rare and valuable
   germplasm via cryopreservation. We have developed a highly effective
   medium for initiation of embryogenic tissue from immature or mature
   seeds of Fraser fir that contains AL salts (Kvaalen et al., in Can J For
   Res 35:1053-1060, 2005), brassinolide, paclobutrazol and abscisic acid.
   Using dominant embryos attached to the female gametophyte placed on
   medium, the highest initiation percentages occurred with precotyledonary
   stage 3 embryos. When tested with 11 high-value open-pollinated families
   over 5 years, initiation tests for medium containing brassinolide and
   paclobutrazol averaged 6-62 \% initiation. A maintenance medium was
   developed that contained AL salts and 1.1 mg L-1 BAP and was able to
   capture approximately 50 \% of the initiations. A maturation medium was
   developed containing AL salts, maltose, polyethylene glycol 8000 and
   abscisic acid that produced cotyledonary embryos capable of germination
   to produce a root and shoot. Culture cryopreservation and retrieval was
   also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) dislocation microscopy is an
   important, emerging field in metals characterization. Currently,
   calculation of geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density is
   problematic because it has been shown to depend on the step size of the
   EBSD scan used to investigate the sample. This paper models the change
   in calculated GND density as a function of step size statistically. The
   model provides selection criteria for EBSD step size as well as an
   estimate of the total dislocation content. Evaluation of a
   heterogeneously deformed tantalum specimen is used to asses the method.

Abstract = {{The co-exposure to UV irradiation and free chlorine may occur in certain
   drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. This study investigated
   the effects of simultaneous low pressure ultraviolet (LPUV) irradiation
   and free chlorination on the formation of chloroform from triclosan
   which is a commonly used antibacterial agent. Different treatment
   systems (i.e., combined UV/chlorine, UV alone, and chlorine alone) were
   applied to examine the degradation of triclosan and formation of
   chloroform. The fate of representative intermediates, including
   chlorinated triclosan, dechlorinated triclosan intermediates and
   2,4-dichlorophenol, were tracked to deduce the effect of combined
   UV/chlorine on the transformation of chloroform formation precursors.
   The relation between intermediates degradation and chloroform formation
   was investigated in depth by conducting stepwise experiments with UV and
   chlorine in different sequences. Results indicate that the combined
   UV/chlorine notably enhanced the chloroform formation from triclosan.
   From the reaction mechanism perspective the combined UV/chlorine, where
   the direct photolysis may play an important role, could accelerate the
   decay of intermediates and facilitate the generation of productive
   chloroform precursors. The radicals had modest influence on the
   degradation of triclosan and intermediates and partly hindered the
   formation of chloroform. These results emphasize the necessity of
   considering disinfection by-products formation in the application of
   combined UV/chlorine technology during water treatment. (C) 2015

Journal = {{CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{497-500}},

Abstract = {{Various boron (B) diffusion techniques are being investigated to
   fabricate n-type Si solar cells. Thermal oxidation is often used to
   remove boron-rich layer (BRL) formed as a byproduct of B diffusion
   because BRL interferes with surface passivation of boron emitter.
   However, oxidizing the BRL can cause significant degradation in bulk
   lifetime. In this paper, high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) was
   performed to detect the presence of BRL after B diffusion and its
   removal after subsequent oxidation. In addition, bulk lifetime of n-type
   Si with BRL was measured after various oxidation conditions to
   systematically investigate the mechanism of oxidation-induced lifetime
   degradation in n-type Si. Detailed analysis of the oxidized samples
   revealed that iron (Fe) is primary metal impurity responsible for the
   bulk lifetime degradation after oxidation. This happens because Fe is
   gettered in BRL after B diffusion and during the oxidation, when the BRL
   is consumed, Fe is released into the bulk to degrade lifetime. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Air pollution exposure has been linked to numerous adverse health
   effects, with some disadvantaged subgroups disproportionately burdened.
   The objective of this work was to characterize distributions of
   emissions and concentrations of a few important urban air toxics at high
   spatiotemporal resolution in order to assess exposure and inequality.
   Benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were the focus
   pollutants, with oxides of nitrogen (NOx) estimated for comparisons.
   Primary pollutant emissions were estimated for the full spectrum of
   source types in the Tampa area using a hybrid approach that is most
   detailed for major roadways and includes hourly variations in vehicle
   speed. Resultant pollutant concentrations were calculated using the
   CALPUFF dispersion model, and combined with CMAQ model output to account
   for secondary formation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Census
   demographic data were applied to estimate residential pollution
   exposures and inequality among population subgroups. Estimated
   concentrations of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and NOx were generally higher
   in urban areas and lower in rural areas. Exposures to these pollutants
   were disproportionately high for subgroups characterized as black,
   Hispanic and low income (annual household income less than \$20,000).
   For formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, the patterns of concentration and
   exposure were largely reversed. Results suggest that disparities in
   exposure depend on pollutant type. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{To understand the structural changes of lignin after soda-AQ and kraft

   and resinol (beta-beta `) substructures, while minor content of
   spirodienone (beta-1'), dibenzodioxocin (5-5 `) and alpha,beta-diaryl
   ether linkages were detected as well. After pretreatment, most lignin
   inter-units and lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) linkages were degraded
   and dissolved in black liquor, with minor amount left in residual
   pretreated biomass. In addition, through quantitative C-13 and 2D-HSQC
   NMR spectral analysis, lignin and LCC were found to be more degraded
   after kraft pretreatment than soda-AQ pretreatment. Furthermore, the
   subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis results showed that more cellulose in
   wheat straw was converted to glucose after kraft pretreatment,
   indicating that LCC linkages were important in the enzymatic hydrolysis

Abstract = {{Composite fibers from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and softwood lignin (SWL)

   fiber properties and thermal stabilization reaction kinetics. PAN/SWL
   composite precursor fiber exhibits comparable tensile properties to PAN

   PAN. Thermal stabilization reactions (e.g. oxidation, cyclization, and
   crosslinking) for both PAN and PAN/SWL fibers were individually studied
   by different scanning calorimetry. The addition of SWL was shown to
   reduce the activation energies and increase reaction rates of
   cyclization, oxidation and crosslinking. Thermo-mechanical analysis
   (TMA) was employed to monitor the effect of applied tensions on PAN
   cyclization kinetics under non-isothermal heating process. Cyclization
   activation energies of PAN/SWL fiber are shown to be consistently lower
   than those of PAN fiber under all applied tensions. Calculations of
   cyclization reaction kinetics constants from TMA indicate that SWL can
   promote PAN cyclization and crosslinking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Enclosing the behavior of a hybrid automaton up to and beyond a Zeno

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Even simple hybrid automata like the classic bouncing ball can exhibit
   Zeno behavior. The existence of this type of behavior has so far forced
   a large class of simulators to either ignore some events or risk looping
   indefinitely. This in turn forces modelers to either insert ad-hoc
   restrictions to circumvent Zeno behavior or to abandon hybrid automata.
   To address this problem, we take a fresh look at event detection and
   localization. A key insight'that emerges from this investigation is that
   an enclosure for a given time interval can be valid independent of the
   occurrence of a given event. Such an event can then even occur an
   unbounded number of times. This insight makes it possible to handle some
   types of Zeno behavior. If the post-Zeno state is defined explicitly in
   the given model of the hybrid automaton, the computed enclosure covers
   the corresponding trajectory that starts from the Zeno point through a
   restarted evolution. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Strategies for investing in renewable energy projects present high risks
   associated with generation and price volatility and dynamics. Existing
   approaches for determining optimal strategies are based on real options
   theory, that often simplify the uncertainty process, or on stochastic
   programming approaches, that simplify the dynamic aspects. In this
   paper, we bridge the gap between these approaches by developing a
   multistage stochastic programming approach that includes real options
   such as postponing, hedging with fixed (forward) contracts and
   combination with other sources. The proposed model is solved by a
   procedure based on the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP)
   method. The framework is extended to the risk averse setting. A specific
   case study in investment in hydro and wind projects in the Brazilian
   market is used to illustrate that the investment strategies generated by
   the proposed approach are efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and

   prepared via coprecipitation method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{405}},
Pages = {{36-41}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the cobalt zinc ferrite was prepared by coprecipitation
   method at different pH conditions. The influence of pH values on the
   coprecipitation reaction was theoretically analyzed at first. The
   calculated results showed that the pH values should be controlled in the
   range of 9-11 to form the stable precipitation. The XRD investigation
   was used to further confirm the formation of the composite on specific
   pH values. In addition, the morphological study revealed that the
   average particle size of the composite decreased from 40 nm to 30 nm
   when the pH value increased from 9-11. The variation of microstructure
   plays a critical role in controlling the electromagnetic properties.
   From the electromagnetic analysis, the dielectric loss factor was
   0.02-0.07 and magnetic loss factor was 0.2-0.5 for the composite
   synthesized at pH of 9, which presents dramatically improved dielectric
   loss and magnetic loss properties than the samples prepared at pH of 10
   and 11. The as-prepared cobalt zinc ferrite are highly promising to be
   used as microwave absorption materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The converter with a single-phase rectifier, a dc-link circuit and a
   three-phase inverter is widely applied in high-speed railway electrical
   traction drive system. The fault frequency of single-phase rectifier is
   higher than that of three-phase inverter. Thus, this paper presents a
   new and fast model-based approach for open-switch fault diagnosis of the
   single-phase pulse width modulation rectifier, based on the mixed
   logical dynamic model and residual generation. It requires no additional
   hardware but only some measurements and command signals which are
   available in control system. This diagnosis method is quite suitable for
   electrical traction application due to the fast diagnosis time, simple
   structure and high reliability. Experimental results confirm the
   effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that
   such diagnosis method can locate the faulty switch in a few milliseconds
   which is important to avoid catastrophic consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the power and energy performance of supercapacitors
   connected to constant power elements is important for many applications.
   This paper proposes a characterization method for two supercapacitor
   models that are used to analyze the power and energy behavior of
   supercapacitors connected to constant power elements: linear capacitance
   model and constant capacitance model. The linear or constant capacitance
   is determined by conducting a constant power experiment. A set of
   constant, power experiments is designed. The proposed method can reduce
   the error in estimating the constant power experiment time for a variety
   of supercapacitor samples with different rated capacitance and voltage.
   The accuracy of using the linear capacitance model and the constant
   capacitance model is approximately equal. Moreover, the performance
   evaluation results suggest that using the linear or constant capacitance
   fitted through a low power discharge experiment can minimize the error,
   which can serve as a guideline to design the constant power experiment.

Abstract = {{Severe weather events frequently result in large-scale power failures,
   affecting millions of people for extended durations. However, the lack
   of comprehensive, detailed failure and recovery data has impeded
   large-scale resilience studies. Here, we analyse data from four major
   service regions representing Upstate New York during Super Storm Sandy
   and daily operations. Using non-stationary spatiotemporal random
   processes that relate infrastructural failures to recoveries and cost,
   our data analysis shows that local power failures have a
   disproportionally large non-local impact on people (that is, the top
   20\% of failures interrupted 84\% of services to customers). A large
   number (89\%) of small failures, represented by the bottom 34\% of
   customers and commonplace devices, resulted in 56\% of the total cost of
   28 million customer interruption hours. Our study shows that extreme
   weather does not cause, but rather exacerbates, existing
   vulnerabilities, which are obscured in daily operations.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanics of deformation in miniaturized indirect extrusion (IE) and
   their resulting process outcomes are shown to be dependent on the
   dimensional scale of the plastic deformation zone. Using optically
   transparent dies as prototypes, the effect of process length-scales on
   the strain, strain-rate, and rotation fields is elucidated using digital
   image correlation. In this regard, in situ experiments were performed on
   commercially pure Lead (Pb) and Aluminum (Al 1100) as prototypical
   nonwork/work hardening materials. By overlaying these measurements with
   microstructural characterization via electron backscattered diffraction,
   the effect of deformation volume on process-structure mappings is
   identified. Herein, visco-plastic self-consistent framework-based
   modeling of the evolution of crystallographic textures was investigated
   to achieve insights into the trajectories of microstructure evolution
   and process outcomes during IE. These findings provide a beneficial
   background about characteristics of plastic deformation zone and its
   distribution to optimize and control the properties of miniaturized

Abstract = {{Volcanic eruptions transfer huge amounts of gas to the atmosphere1,2. In
   particular, the sulfur released during large silicic explosive eruptions
   can induce global cooling3. A fundamental goal in volcanology,
   therefore, is to assess the potential for eruption of the large volumes
   of crystal-poor, silicic magma that are stored at shallow depths in the
   crust, and to obtain theoretical bounds for the amount of volatiles that
   can be released during these eruptions. It is puzzling that highly
   evolved, crystal-poor silicic magmas are more likely to generate
   volcanic rocks than plutonic rocks(4,5). This observation suggests that
   such magmas are more prone to erupting than are their crystal-rich
   counterparts. Moreover, well studied examples of largely crystal-poor
   eruptions (for example, Katmai(6), Taupo(7) and Minoan(8)) often exhibit
   a release of sulfur that is 10 to 20 times higher than the amount of
   sulfur estimated to be stored in the melt. Here we argue that these two
   observations rest on how the magmatic volatile phase (MVP) behaves as it
   rises buoyantly in zoned magma reservoirs. By investigating the fluid
   dynamics that controls the transport of the MVP in crystal-rich and
   crystal-poor magmas, we show how the interplay between capillary
   stresses and the viscosity contrast between the MVP and the host melt
   results in a counterintuitive dynamics, whereby the MVP tends to migrate
   efficiently in crystal-rich parts of a magma reservoir and accumulate in
   crystal-poor regions. The accumulation of low-density bubbles of MVP in
   crystal-poor magmas has implications for the eruptive potential of such
   magmas(9,10), and is the likely source of the excess sulfur released
   during explosive eruptions.}},

Abstract = {{Although effective drugs that lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in the
   management of glaucoma exist, their efficacy is limited by poor patient
   adherence to the prescribed eye drop regimen. To replace the need for
   eye drops, in this study we tested the hypothesis that IOP can be
   reduced for one month after a single targeted injection using a
   microneedle for administration of a glaucoma medication (i.e.,
   brimonidine) formulated for sustained release in the supraciliary space
   of the eye adjacent to the drug's site of action at the ciliary body. To
   test this hypothesis, brimonidine-loaded microspheres were formulated
   using poly(lactic acid) (PLA) to release brimonidine at a constant rate
   for 35 days and microneedles were designed to penetrate through the
   sclera, without penetrating into the choroid/retina, in order to target
   injection into the supraciliary space. A single administration of these
   microspheres using a hollow microneedle was performed in the eye of New
   Zealand White rabbits and was found to reduce IOP initially by 6 mm Hg
   and then by progressively smaller amounts for more than one month. All
   administrations were well tolerated without significant adverse events,
   although histological examination showed a foreign-body reaction to the
   microspheres. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the
   highly-targeted delivery of brimonidine-loaded microspheres into the
   supraciliary space using a microneedle is able to reduce IOP for one
   month as an alternative to daily eye drops. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Meteorology and microphysics affect cloud formation, cloud droplet
   distributions, and shortwave reflectance. The Eastern Pacific Emitted
   Aerosol Cloud Experiment and the Stratocumulus Observations of
   Los-Angeles Emissions Derived Aerosol-Droplets studies provided
   measurements in six case studies of cloud thermodynamic properties,
   initial particle number distribution and composition, and cloud drop
   distribution. In this study, we use simulations from a chemical and
   microphysical aerosol-cloud parcel (ACP) model with explicit kinetic
   drop activation to reproduce observed cloud droplet distributions of the
   case studies. Four cases had subadiabatic lapse rates, resulting in
   fewer activated droplets, lower liquid water content, and higher cloud
   base height than an adiabatic lapse rate. A weighted ensemble of
   simulations that reflect measured variation in updraft velocity and
   cloud base height was used to reproduce observed droplet distributions.
   Simulations show that organic hygroscopicity in internally mixed cases
   causes small effects on cloud reflectivity (CR) (<0.01), except for
   cargo ship and smoke plumes, which increased CR by 0.02 and 0.07,
   respectively, owing to their high organic mass fraction. Organic
   hygroscopicity had larger effects on droplet concentrations for cases
   with higher aerosol concentrations near the critical diameter (namely,
   polluted cases with a modal peak near 0.1 mu m). Differences in
   simulated droplet spectral widths (k) caused larger differences in CR
   than organic hygroscopicity in cases with organic mass fractions of 60\%
   or less for the cases shown. Finally, simulations from a numerical
   parameterization of cloud droplet activation suitable for general
   circulation models compared well with the ACP model, except under high
   organic mass fraction.}},

Abstract = {{We examine wet scavenging of soluble trace gases in storms observed
   during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign. We
   conduct high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and
   Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) of a severe storm in
   Oklahoma. The model represents well the storm location, size, and
   structure as compared with Next Generation Weather Radar reflectivity,
   and simulated CO transport is consistent with aircraft observations.
   Scavenging efficiencies (SEs) between inflow and outflow of soluble
   species are calculated from aircraft measurements and model simulations.
   Using a simple wet scavenging scheme, we simulate the SE of each soluble
   species within the error bars of the observations. The simulated SEs of
   all species except nitric acid (HNO3) are highly sensitive to the values
   specified for the fractions retained in ice when cloud water freezes. To
   reproduce the observations, we must assume zero ice retention for
   formaldehyde (CH2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and complete retention
   for methyl hydrogen peroxide (CH3OOH) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), likely
   to compensate for the lack of aqueous chemistry in the model. We then
   compare scavenging efficiencies among storms that formed in Alabama and
   northeast Colorado and the Oklahoma storm. Significant differences in
   SEs are seen among storms and species. More scavenging of HNO3 and less
   removal of CH3OOH are seen in storms with higher maximum flash rates, an
   indication of more graupel mass. Graupel is associated with mixed-phase
   scavenging and lightning production of nitrogen oxides (NOx), processes
   that may explain the observed differences in HNO3 and CH3OOH scavenging.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with conventional optical methods, optics implemented on
   microfluidic chips provide small, and often much cheaper ways to
   interrogate biological systems from the level of single molecules up to
   small model organisms. The optical probing of single molecules has been
   used to investigate the mechanical properties of individual biological
   molecules; however, multiplexing of these measurements through
   microfluidics and nanofluidics confers many analytical advantages.
   Optics-integrated microfluidic systems can significantly simplify sample
   processing and allow a more user-friendly experience; alignments of
   on-chip optical components are predetermined during fabrication and many
   purely optical techniques are passively controlled. Furthermore, sample
   loss from complicated preparation and fluid transfer steps can be
   virtually eliminated, a particularly important attribute for biological
   molecules at very low concentrations. Excellent fluid handling and high
   surface area/volume ratios also contribute to faster detection times for
   low abundance molecules in small sample volumes. Although integration of
   optical systems with classical microfluidic analysis techniques has been
   limited, microfluidics offers a ready platform for interrogation of
   biophysical properties. By exploiting the ease with which fluids and
   particles can be precisely and dynamically controlled in microfluidic
   devices, optical sensors capable of unique imaging modes, single
   molecule manipulation, and detection of minute changes in concentration
   of an analyte are possible.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the electrically controlled and reversible plasmonic
   signature of hybrid polymer metal nanostructures composed of core/shell
   nanostructures: gold nanocubes (AuNCs) coated with electrochromic
   polyaniline (PANI) shells. A reversible tuning of the localized surface
   plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of the AuNC core was obtained by applying
   an electrical potential that caused a reversible oxidation state change
   in the electroactive PANI nanoshell. A significant shift of the main
   LSPR peak was achieved with high reversibility and electrochemical
   stability due to the interplay of the local decay of the electromagnetic
   field and the controlled thickness of the surrounding polymer shell.
   Here, the PANI shell acts as an electroactive medium as well as a
   physical spacer to prevent uncontrollable plasmonic coupling. The most
   efficient LSPR shift can be induced by the refractive index change of
   nanoscale PANI shell thickness lower than the electromagnetic field
   decay length of the given gold nanoparticles. Single particle studies
   showed that coupling of plasmon resonances of densely packed nanocubes
   with thicker PANI shells was prevented and the extinction signature of
   individual core/shell nanocubes remained mostly unchanged after their
   assembly into densely packed aggregates. Therefore, these core/shell
   structures could preserve the original plasmonic signature of individual
   nanostructure by damping plasmonic coupling between AuNC cores.}},

Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on a new type of high-frequency mode-matched
   gyroscope with significantly reduced dependencies on environmental
   stimuli such as temperature, vibration, and shock. A novel
   stress-isolation system is used to effectively decouple an
   axis-symmetric bulk-acoustic wave (BAW) vibratory gyro from its
   substrate, minimizing the effect that external sources of error have on
   the offset and scale factor of the device. Substrate-decoupled (SD) BAW
   gyros with a resonance frequency of 4.3 MHz and Q values near 60 000
   were implemented using the high aspect ratio poly and single-crystal
   silicon (HARPSS) process to achieve ultra-narrow capacitive gaps.
   Wafer-level packaged sensors were interfaced with a customized
   application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to achieve low variations
   in the offset across temperature (+/- 26 degrees s(-1) from -40 to 85
   degrees C), supreme random-vibration immunity (0.012 degrees s(-1)
   g(RMS)(-1)) and excellent shock rejection. With a scale factor of 800 mu
   V (degrees s(-1))(-1), the SD-BAW gyro system attains a large full-scale
   range (+/- 1250 degrees s(-1)) with a non-linearity of less than 0.07\%.
   A measured angle-random walk (ARW) of 0.39 degrees/root h and a bias
   instability of 10.5 degrees h(-1) are dominated by the thermal and
   flicker noise of the integrated circuit (IC), respectively. Additional
   measurements using external electronics show bias-instability values as
   low as 3.5 degrees h(-1), which are limited by feed-through signals
   coupled from the drive loop to the sense channel, which can be further
   reduced through proper re-routing of the gyroscope pin-out
   configuration.}},

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) direct writing based on the meniscus-confined
   electrodeposition of copper metal wires was used in this study to
   develop vertical capacitive microelectromechanical switches. Vertical
   microelectromechanical switches reduce the form factor and increase the
   area density of such devices in integrated circuits. We studied the
   electromechanical characteristics of such vertical switches by exploring
   the dependence of switching voltage on various device structures,
   particularly with regard to the length, wire diameter, and the distance
   between the two wires. A simple model was found to match the
   experimental measurements made in this study. We found that the
   electrodeposited copper microwires exhibit a good elastic modulus close
   to that of bulk copper. By optimizing the 3D structure of the
   electrodes, a volatile electromechanical switch with a sub-5 V switching
   voltage was demonstrated in a vertical microscale switch with a gap
   distance as small as 100 nm created with a pair of copper wires with
   diameters of similar to 1 mu m and heights of 25 mu m. This study
   establishes an innovative approach to construct microelectromechanical
   systems with arbitrary 3D microwire structures for various applications,

Abstract = {{How soil microbial communities contrast with respect to taxonomic and
   functional composition within and between ecosystems remains an
   unresolved question that is central to predicting how global
   anthropogenic change will affect soil functioning and services. In
   particular, it remains unclear how small-scale observations of soil
   communities based on the typical volume sampled (1-2 g) are
   generalizable to ecosystem-scale responses and processes. This is
   especially relevant for remote, northern latitude soils, which are
   challenging to sample and are also thought to be more vulnerable to
   climate change compared to temperate soils. Here, we employed
   well-replicated shotgun metagenome and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing
   to characterize community composition and metabolic potential in Alaskan
   tundra soils, combining our own datasets with those publically available
   from distant tundra and temperate grassland and agriculture habitats. We
   found that the abundance of many taxa and metabolic functions differed
   substantially between tundra soil metagenomes relative to those from
   temperate soils, and that a high degree of OTU-sharing exists between
   tundra locations. Tundra soils were an order of magnitude less complex
   than their temperate counterparts, allowing for near-complete coverage
   of microbial community richness (similar to 92\% breadth) by sequencing,
   and the recovery of 27 high-quality, almost complete (>80\%
   completeness) population bins. These population bins, collectively, made
   up to similar to 10\% of the metagenomic datasets, and represented
   diverse taxonomic groups and metabolic lifestyles tuned toward sulfur
   cycling, hydrogen metabolism, methanotrophy, and organic matter
   oxidation. Several population bins, including members of Acidobacteria,
   Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, were also present in geographically
   distant (similar to 100-530 km apart) tundra habitats (full genome
   representation and up to 99.6\% genome-derived average nucleotide
   identity). Collectively, our results revealed that Alaska tundra
   microbial communities are less diverse and more homogenous across
   spatial scales than previously anticipated, and provided DNA sequences
   of abundant populations and genes that would be relevant for future
   studies of the effects of environmental change on tundra ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in epitaxial growth have led to the growth of
   III-nitride devices on 2D layered h-BN. This advance has the potential
   for wafer-scale transfer to arbitrary substrates, which could improve
   the thermal management and would allow III-N devices to be used more
   flexibly in a broader range of applications. We report wafer scale
   exfoliation of a metal organic vapor phase epitaxy grown InGaN/GaN Multi
   Quantum Well (MQW) structure from a 5 nm thick h-BN layer that was grown
   on a 2-inch sapphire substrate. The weak van der Waals bonds between
   h-BN atomic layers break easily, allowing the MQW structure to be
   mechanically lifted off from the sapphire substrate using a commercial
   adhesive tape. This results in the surface roughness of only 1.14 nm on
   the separated surface. Structural characterizations performed before and
   after the lift-off confirm the conservation of structural properties
   after lift-off. Cathodoluminescence at 454 nm was present before
   lift-off and 458 nm was present after. Electroluminescence near 450 nm
   from the lifted-off structure has also been observed. These results show
   that the high crystalline quality ultrathin h-BN serves as an effective
   sacrificial layer-it maintains performance, while also reducing the GaN
   buffer thickness and temperature ramps as compared to a conventional
   two-step growth method. These results support the use of h-BN as a
   low-tack sacrificial underlying layer for GaN-based device structures
   and demonstrate the feasibility of large area lift-off and transfer to
   any template, which is important for industrial scale production.

Abstract = {{Mechanics play a fundamental role in cell biology, but detecting
   piconewton (pN) forces is challenging because of a lack of accessible
   and high throughput assays. A mechanically induced catalytic
   amplification reaction (MCR) for readout of receptor-mediated forces in
   cells is described. Mechanically labile DNA duplexes presenting ligands
   are surface immobilized such that specific receptor forces denature the
   duplex and thus expose a blocked primer. Amplification of primers is
   achieved using an isothermal polymerization reaction and quantified by
   fluorescence readout. As a proof of concept, the assay was used to test
   the activity of a mechanomodulatory drug and integrin adhesion receptor
   antibodies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a
   catalytic reaction triggered in response to molecular piconewton forces.
   The MCR may transform the field of mechanobiology by providing a new
   facile tool to detect receptor specific mechanics with the convenience
   of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).}},

Abstract = {{The creation of reversibly-actuating components that alter their shapes
   in a controllable manner in response to environmental stimuli is a grand
   challenge in active materials, structures, and robotics. Here we
   demonstrate a new reversible shape-changing component design concept
   enabled by 3D printing two stimuli responsive polymers-shape memory
   polymers and hydrogels-in prescribed 3D architectures. This approach
   uses the swelling of a hydrogel as the driving force for the shape
   change, and the temperature-dependent modulus of a shape memory polymer
   to regulate the time of such shape change. Controlling the temperature
   and aqueous environment allows switching between two stable
   configurations - the structures are relatively stiff and can carry load
   in each - without any mechanical loading and unloading. Specific shape
   changing scenarios, e.g., based on bending, or twisting in prescribed
   directions, are enabled via the controlled interplay between the active
   materials and the 3D printed architectures. The physical phenomena are
   complex and nonintuitive, and so to help understand the interplay of
   geometric, material, and environmental stimuli parameters we develop 3D
   nonlinear finite element models. Finally, we create several 2D and 3D
   shape changing components that demonstrate the role of key parameters
   and illustrate the broad application potential of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Rational design of catalysts would be aided by a better understanding of
   how non-covalent interactions stabilize transition states. Here, we
   apply the newly-developed Functional-Group Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation
   Theory (F-SAPT) to quantify non-covalent interactions in transition
   states of the proline-catalyzed intermolecular aldol reaction between
   benzaldehyde and cyclohexanone, according to the Houk-List mechanism
   {[}Bahmanyar et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2003, 125, 2475]. A recent
   re-examination of this organocatalytic reaction by Rzepa and co-workers
   {[}Armstrong et al., Chem. Sci., 2014, 5, 2057] used electron density
   analysis to identify three key non-covalent interactions thought to
   influence stereoselectivity: (1) a favorable electrostatic interaction
   (originally identified by Houk and List) between the NCH delta+ group of
   the enamine intermediate and the O delta--C of benzaldehyde; (2) a
   C-H/pi interaction between the cyclohexene group of the enamine
   intermediate and the benzaldehyde phenyl ring; (3) a stabilizing contact
   between an ortho-hydrogen of the phenyl and an oxygen of the carboxylic
   acid group of the enamine. These three interactions have been directly
   computed using F-SAPT, which confirms the stabilizing interaction
   between an ortho-hydrogen and the carboxylic acid in the (S, S) and (R,
   S) transition state stereoisomers. F-SAPT analysis also finds
   stabilizing dispersion and electrostatic interactions due to a C-H/pi
   interaction between the cyclohexene and phenyl groups in the (S, S) and
   (R, R) transition states. However, unfavorable exchange-repulsion
   cancels the attractive terms that favor these stereoisomers.
   Surprisingly, the interaction thought to be most important for
   stereoselectivity, the NCH delta+ center dot center dot center dot O
   delta-=C interaction, is actually found to be repulsive due to the
   negative charge on the nitrogen. Hence, our results indicate that
   geometric analysis and/or density-based analysis does not necessarily
   produce a reliable picture of non-covalent stabilization. As confirmed
   by high-level coupled-cluster computations, intermolecular interaction
   energies are strongest for the (R,R) transition states, which are not
   the experimentally favored products. This suggests that at least for
   this reaction, stereoselectivity is also strongly dependent on the
   energy required to distort the reacting molecules into the transition
   state geometry.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an efficient technique to align lyotropic chromonic
   liquid crystals (LCLCs) using secondary sputtering lithography (SSL).
   Monodomains of LCLCs prepared using SSL maintained their stable
   alignment for days. A generalization of Berreman's theory was employed
   to determine the anchoring strength of LCLCs on tessellated surface
   patterns. The anchoring energy initially increases with the amplitude
   (A) of the grooves and excellent alignment of LCLCs was observed when
   the amplitude of the grooves is equal to half its wavelength (lambda).
   We also note that the anchoring energy levels off above qA similar to 3
   (where q = 2 pi/lambda), which suggests that increasing qA beyond a
   certain value does not provide any further advantage for the alignment
   of LCLCs. This finding provides a useful optimization criterion for the
   fabrication of the patterned cells to achieve stable monodomain
   alignment of LCLCs. Our analysis also explains why good alignment of
   LCLCs has been a difficult task.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Signals Inhibit Growth of a Grafted Tumor In Vivo: Proof of
   Concept}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{In the past ten years, many studies have shown that malignant tissue has
   been ``normalized{''} in vitro using mechanical signals. We apply the
   principles of physical oncology (or mechanobiology) in vivo to show the
   effect of a ``constraint field{''} on tumor growth. The human breast
   cancer cell line, MDA MB 231, admixed with ferric nanoparticles was
   grafted subcutaneously in Nude mice. The magnetizable particles rapidly
   surrounded the growing tumor. Two permanent magnets located on either
   side of the tumor created a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy
   is transformed into mechanical energy by the particles acting as
   ``bioactuators{''}, applying a constraint field and, by consequence,
   biomechanical stress to the tumor. This biomechanical treatment was
   applied 2 hours/day during 21 days, from Day 18 to Day 39 following
   tumor implantation. The study lasted 74 days. Palpable tumor was
   measured two times a week. There was a significant in vivo difference
   between the median volume of treated tumors and untreated controls in
   the mice measured up to D 74 (D 59 + population): (529 {[}346; 966]
   mm(3) vs 1334 {[}256; 2106] mm(3); p = 0.015), treated mice having
   smaller tumors. The difference was not statistically significant in the
   group of mice measured at least to D 59 (D 59 population). On ex vivo
   examination, the surface of the tumor mass, measured on histologic
   sections, was less in the treated group, G1, than in the control groups:
   G2 (nanoparticles, no magnetic field), G3 (magnetic field, no
   nanoparticles), G4 (no nanoparticles, no magnetic field) in the D 59
   population (Median left surface was significantly lower in G1 (5.6
   {[}3.0; 42.4] mm(2), p = 0.005) than in G2 (20.8 {[}4.9; 34.3]), G3
   (16.5 {[}13.2; 23.2]) and G4 (14.8 {[}1.8; 55.5]); Median right surface
   was significantly lower in G1 (4.7 {[}1.9; 29.2] mm(2), p = 0.015) than
   in G2 (25.0 {[}5.2; 55.0]), G3 (18.0 {[}14.6; 35.2]) and G4 (12.5
   {[}1.5; 51.8]). There was no statistically significant difference in the
   day 59+ population. This is the first demonstration of the effect of
   stress on tumor growth in vivo suggesting that biomechanical
   intervention may have a high translational potential as a therapy in
   locally advanced tumors like pancreatic cancer or primary hepatic
   carcinoma for which no effective therapy is currently available.}},

Title = {{Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Sustainable Wastewater Treatment via a
   Self-Powered Electrochemical Process}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{By harvesting the flowing kinetic energy of water using a rotating
   triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG), this study demonstrates a
   self-powered wastewater treatment system that simultaneously removes
   rhodamine B (RhB) and copper ions through an advanced electrochemical
   unit. With the electricity generated by R-TENG, the removal efficiency
   (RE) of RhB can reach the vicinity of 100\% within just 15 min when the
   initial concentration of RhB is around 100 ppm at optimized conditions.
   The removal efficiency of copper ions can reach 97.3\% after 3 h within
   an initial concentration of 150 ppm at an optimized condition.
   Importantly, a better performance and higher treating efficiency are
   found by using the pulsed output of R-TENG than those using direct
   current (DC) supply for pollutant removal when consuming equal amount of
   energy. The recovered copper layer on the cathode through R-TENG is much
   denser, more uniform, and with smaller grain size (d = 20 nm) than those
   produced by DC process, which also hints at very promising applications
   of the R-TENG in electroplating industry. In light of the merits such as
   easy portability, low cost, and effectiveness, this R-TENG-based
   self-powered electrochemical system holds great potential in wastewater
   treatment and electroplating industry.}},

Abstract = {{Freestanding large-size SnS thin crystals are synthesized via
   two-dimensional oriented attachment (OA) growth of colloidal quantum
   dots (CQDs) in a novel high, pressure solvothermal reaction. The SnS
   thin crystals present a uniform rectangular shape with a lateral size of
   20-30 um and thickness of <10 nm. The evolution process demonstrates
   that a synergetic effect of pressure, aging time and organic ligands
   results in polycrystal-to-monocrystal formation and defect annihilation.
   Furthermore, gas sensor and photodetector devices, based on SnS thin
   single crystals, are also prepared. The sensing devices present high
   sensitivity, superior selectivity, low detection limit (<< 100 ppb) and
   reversibility to NO2 at room temperature. The fabricated photodetector
   devices exhibit a high responsivity of 2.04 x 10(3) A W1- and high

   Removal from Natural Gas}},
Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Zeolite NaY and metal organic frameworks MIL-53(Al) and UiO-66(Zr) are
   spun with cellulose acetate (CA) polymer to create hybrid porous
   composite fibers for the selective adsorption of sulfur odorant
   compounds from pipeline natural gas. Odorant removal is desirable to
   limit corrosion associated with sulfur oxide production, thereby
   increasing lifetime in gas turbines used for electricity generation. In
   line with these goals, the performance of the hybrid fibers is evaluated
   on the basis of sulfur sorption capacity and selectivity, as well as
   fiber stability and regenerability, compared to their polymer-free
   sorbent counterparts. The capacities of the powder sorbents are also
   measured using various desorption temperatures to evaluate the potential
   for lower temperature, energy, and cost-efficient system operation. Both
   NaY/CA and UiO-66(Zr)/CA hybrid fibers are prepared with high sorbent
   loadings, and both have high capacities and selectivities for t-butyl
   mercaptan (TBM) odorant sorption from a model natural gas (NG), while
   being stable to multiple regeneration cycles. The different advantages
   and disadvantages of both types of fibers relative are discussed, with
   both offering the potential advantages of low pressure drop, rapid heat
   and mass transfer, and low energy requirements over traditional sulfur
   removal technologies such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) or adsorption in
   a pellet packed beds.}},

   method facilitates the precision alignment of the optical elements to
   achieve the accurate projection of multiple on-and off-axis images and
   the simultaneous interference of the multiple beams. In addition to the
   multibeam imaging/interference system presented, the procedure can be
   employed in other multibeam imaging and/or interfering configurations.

Abstract = {{Poly(acrylamidoxime) fibers are the current state-of-the-art adsorbent
   for mining uranium from seawater. However, the competition between
   uranyl (UO22+) and vanadium ions poses a challenge to mining on the
   industrial scale. In this work, we employ density functional theory and
   coupled-cluster methods in the restricted formalism to investigate
   potential binding motifs of the oxovanadium(IV) ion (VO2+) with the
   formamidoximate ligand. Consistent with experimental extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure data, the hydrated six-coordinate complex is
   predicted to be preferred over the hydrated five coordinate complex. Our
   investigation of formamidoximate-VO2+ complexes universally identified
   the most stable binding motif formed by chelating a tautomerically
   rearranged imino hydroxylamine via the imino nitrogen and hydroxylamine
   oxygen. The alternative binding motifs for amidoxime chelation via a
   nonrearranged tautomer and eta(2) coordination are found to be similar
   to 11 kcal/mol less stable. Natural bond orbital analysis was performed
   to understand the nature of the interactions in the VO2+ complexes. The
   difference in the most stable VO2+ and UO22+ binding conformation has
   important implications for the design of more selective UO22+ ligands.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the use of stiffness-controlled polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) endplates with Young's modulus of 7.50 x 10(5) Pa and 8.68 x
   10(5) Pa for improving the performance of flexible fuel cells. The
   maximum power densities of stacks with PDMS endplates with Young's
   modulus of 7.50 x 10(5) Pa and 8.68 x 10(5) Pa are 82 mWcm(-2) and 117
   mWcm(-2), respectively. The flexible fuel cells produce a maximum
   absolute power of 1.053 W (i.e., the power density is 117 mWcm(2)) under
   a bending radius of 15 cm. Interestingly, their impedance spectra reveal
   that the ohmic and faradaic resistances decrease under the bent
   condition. Furthermore, the decreased resistance and corresponding
   performance enhancement are due to the increased compressive force
   normal to the membrane electrode assembly, which is investigated using a
   finite element method of stress distribution within the flexible fuel
   cells. As our experiments show, the faradaic impedance decreases
   significantly because the bending radius decreases from 36 cm to 15 cm.

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles have been labeled with various radionuclides and
   extensively explored for single photon emission computed tomography
   (SPECT) in the context of cancer diagnosis. The stability of most
   radiolabels, however, still needs to be improved for accurate detection
   of cancer biomarkers and thereby monitoring of tumor progression and
   metastasis. Here, the first synthesis of Au nanoparticles doped with
   Au-199 atoms for targeted SPECT tumor imaging in a mouse triple negative
   breast cancer (TNBC) model is reported. By directly incorporating Au-199
   atoms into the crystal lattice of each Au nanoparticle, the stability of
   the radiolabel can be ensured. The synthetic procedure also allows for a
   precise control over both the radiochemistry and particle size. When
   conjugated with D-Ala1-peptide T-amide, the Au nanoparticles doped with
   Au-199 atoms can serve as a C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-targeted
   nanoprobe for the sensitive and specific detection of both TNBC and its
   metastasis in a mouse tumor model.}},

Abstract = {{Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are emerging pollutants. Identification of
   microorganisms and the genes involved in the biodegradation of BACs is
   crucial for better understanding the fate of BACs in the environment and
   developing treatment strategies. Four microbial communities degrading
   BACs were developed from sewage (SEW), activated sludge (AS), soil
   (SOIL) and sea sediment (SEA) samples. According to 16S rRNA
   pyrosequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing analyses, the most
   abundant species represented uncharacterized members of the Pseudomonas
   and Achromobacter genera. BAC biotransformation rates of the enriched
   microbial communities were 2.8,3.2, 17.8, and 24.3 mu M hr(-1) for SEA,
   AS, SOIL, and SEW, respectively, and were positively correlated with the
   relative abundance of a particular Pseudomonas sp. strain, BIOMIG1. The
   strain BIOMIG1 mineralizes BACs at a rate up to 2.40 mu mol hr(-1)
   10(-11) cells. Genomes of four BAC degrading and nondegrading BIOMIG1
   phenotypes were sequenced and differentially compared with each other.
   As a result, a gene cluster encoding for transporters, an integrase and
   a dioxygenase were involved in BAC biotransformation. Our results
   suggest that BIOMIG1 plays a key role on the fate of BACs in the
   environment and genes, other than those reported to date, are involved
   in BAC biotransformation in various habitats.}},

Title = {{Inactivation of Escherichia coli, Bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus Spores

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with peroxy chemicals, such as H2O2 and
   peroxydisulfate (PDS), have been considered potentially highly effective
   disinfection processes. This study investigated the inactivation of
   Escherichia coli, bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores as
   surrogates for pathogens under UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS conditions, with the
   aim to provide further understanding of UV-based advanced disinfection
   processes (ADPs). Results showed that one additional log of inactivation
   of E. coli was achieved with 0.3 mM H2O2 or PDS at 5.2 X 10(-5)
   Einstein.L-1 photo fluence (at 254 nm) compared with UV irradiation
   alone. Addition of H2O2 and PDS greatly enhanced the inactivation rate
   of MS2 by around 15 folds and 3 folds, respectively, whereas the
   inactivation of B. subtilis spores was slightly enhanced. Reactive
   species responsible for the inactivation were identified to be center
   dot OH, SO4 center dot-, and CO3 center dot- based on manipulation of
   solution conditions. The CT value of each reactive species was
   calculated with respect to each microbial surrogate, which showed that
   the disinfection efficacy ranked as center dot OH > SO4 center dot- >
   CO3 center dot->> O-2(center dot-)/HO2-. A comprehensive dynamic model
   was developed and successfully predicted the inactivation of the
   microbial surrogates in surface water and wastewater matrices. The
   concepts of UV-efficiency and EE/O were employed to provide a
   cost-effective evaluation for UV-based ADPs. Overall, the present study
   suggests that it will be beneficial to upgrade UV disinfection to
   UV/H2O2 ADP for the inactivation of viral pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Tribotronics is a new field developed by coupling triboelectricity and
   semiconductor, which can drive triboelectric-charge-controlled
   optoelectronic devices by further introducing optoelectronics. In this
   paper, a tribotronic phototransistor (TPT) is proposed by coupling a
   field-effect phototransistor and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG),
   in which the contact-induced inner gate voltage by the mobile frictional
   layer is used for modulating the photodetection characteristics of the
   TPT. Based on the TPT, alternatively, a coupled energy-harvester (CEH)
   is fabricated for simultaneously scavenging solar and wind energies, in
   which the output voltage on the external resistance from the wind driven
   TENG is used as the gate voltage of the TPT for enhancing the solar
   energy conversion. As the wind speed increases, the photovoltaic
   characteristics of the CEH including the short-circuit current,
   open-circuit voltage, and maximal output power have been greatly
   enhanced. This work has greatly expanded the functionality of
   tribotronics in photodetection and energy harvesting, and provided a
   potential solution for highly efficient harvesting and utilizing
   multitype energy.}},

   Imaging}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Weapons-grade uranium and plutonium could be used as nuclear explosives
   with extreme destructive potential. The problem of their detection,
   especially in standard cargo containers during transit, has been
   described as ``searching for a needle in a haystack{''} because of the
   inherently low rate of spontaneous emission of characteristic
   penetrating radiation and the ease of its shielding. Currently, the only
   practical approach for uncovering well-shielded special nuclear
   materials is by use of active interrogation using an external radiation
   source. However, the similarity of these materials to shielding and the
   required radiation doses that may exceed regulatory limits prevent this
   method from being widely used in practice. We introduce a low-dose
   active detection technique, referred to as low-energy nuclear reaction
   imaging, which exploits the physics of interactions of multi-MeV
   monoenergetic photons and neutrons to simultaneously measure the
   material's areal density and effective atomic number, while confirming
   the presence of fissionable materials by observing the beta-delayed
   neutron emission. For the first time, we demonstrate identification and
   imaging of uranium with this novel technique using a simple yet robust
   source, setting the stage for its wide adoption in security
   applications.}},

   dissemination to the lymph node}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{It is well documented that cells secrete exosomes, which can transfer
   biomolecules that impact recipient cells' functionality in a variety of
   physiologic and disease processes. The role of lymphatic drainage and
   transport of exosomes is as yet unknown, although the lymphatics play
   critical roles in immunity and exosomes are in the ideal size-range for
   lymphatic transport. Through in vivo near-infrared (NIR) imaging we have
   shown that exosomes are rapidly transported within minutes from the
   periphery to the lymph node by lymphatics. Using an in vitro model of
   lymphatic uptake, we have shown that lymphatic endothelial cells
   actively enhanced lymphatic uptake and transport of exosomes to the
   luminal side of the vessel. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a
   differential distribution of exosomes in the draining lymph nodes that
   is dependent on the lymphatic flow. Lastly, through endpoint analysis of
   cellular distribution of exosomes in the node, we identified macrophages
   and B-cells as key players in exosome uptake. Together these results
   suggest that exosome transfer by lymphatic flow from the periphery to
   the lymph node could provide a mechanism for rapid exchange of
   infection-specific information that precedes the arrival of migrating
   cells, thus priming the node for a more effective immune response.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{307}},
Pages = {{213-220}},

Abstract = {{AgI/TiO2 was prepared using a dissolution-precipitation method, followed
   by calcination at different temperatures (100-700 degrees C). The
   as-prepared AgI/TiO2 powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis-DRS) and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results revealed that calcination
   temperature significantly impacted the visible light absorption of
   AgI/TiO2 along with a shift from metastable gamma-AgI to relatively
   stable beta-AgI. We found that highest photocatalytic reduction rate of
   Cr(VI) and beta-Agl content were obtained for a calcination temperature
   of 350 degrees C. Furthermore, the pseudo first order rate constant was
   five times that for a photocatalyst calcined at 100 degrees C. The
   dramatically enhanced reduction rate of Cr(VI) was attributed to
   enhanced visible light absorption and greatly reduced charge transfer
   resistance, which eventually facilitates more efficient separation and
   easier transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs to the catalyst
   surface. Other experimental conditions were also carefully investigated
   and optimized with initial AgI loading percentage (5\%), catalyst dosage
   (1.0 g/L.), coexisting organics (1.0 mmol/L EDTA) and pH (1-2). The
   optimal AgI/TiO2 exhibited good stability with little change in activity
   after 5 cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To build materials knowledge, rigorous description of the material
   structure and associated tools to explore and exploit information
   encoded in the structure are needed. These enable recognition,
   categorization and identification of different classes of microstructure
   and ultimately enable to link structure with properties of materials.
   Particular interest lies in the protocols capable of mining the
   essential information in large microstructure datasets and building
   robust knowledge systems that can be easily accessed, searched, and
   shared by the broader materials community.
   In this paper, we develop a protocol based on automated tools to
   classify microstructure taxonomies in the context of coarsening behavior
   which is important for long term stability of materials. Our new
   concepts for enhanced description of the local microstructure state
   provide flexibility of description. The mathematical description of
   microstructure that capture crucial attributes of the material, although
   central to building materials knowledge, is still elusive. The new
   description captures important higher order spatial information, but at
   the same time, allows down sampling if less information is needed. We
   showcase the classification protocol by studying coarsening of binary
   polymer blends and classifying steady state structures. We study several
   microstructure descriptions by changing the microstructure local state
   order and discretization and critically evaluate their efficacy. Our
   analysis revealed the superior properties of microstructure
   representation is based on the first order-gradient of the atomic
   fraction. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{MEMS vibratory gyroscopes measure rotation rates by sensing in various
   ways the effects of the Coriolis force on the gyroscope dynamics. This
   paper presents a rotation rate sensing method that is based on the phase
   shift induced by the Coriolis force in the gyroscope outputs. In
   principle, this method is applicable to any gyroscope that can be
   modeled at the functional level as a 2-DOF mass-spring system. Devices
   of this type include those based on various kinds of vibrating
   structures, as well as bulk acoustic wave (BAW) gyroscopes. Furthermore,
   it is shown that the sensing method presented in this paper can be used
   also for gyroscope calibration with only minor modifications to the
   control electronics, and without the need for additional moving parts or
   calibration stage. This is a significant benefit in applications that
   require in-situ gyroscope calibration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Diffusion of oxygen interstitials in UO2+x using kinetic Monte Carlo
   simulations: Role of O/M ratio and sensitivity analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{472}},
Pages = {{89-98}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Oxygen interstitials in UO2+x significantly affect the thermophysical
   properties and microstructural evolution of the oxide nuclear fuel. In
   hyperstoichiometric Urania (UO2+x), these oxygen interstitials form
   different types of defect clusters, which have different migration
   behavior. In this study we have used kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) to
   evaluate diffusivities of oxygen interstitials accounting for mono-and
   diinterstitial clusters. Our results indicate that the predicted
   diffusivities increase significantly at higher non-stoichiometry (x >
   0.01) for di-interstitial clusters compared to a mono-interstitial only
   model. The diffusivities calculated at higher temperatures compare
   better with experimental values than at lower temperatures (< 973 K). We
   have discussed the resulting activation energies achieved for diffusion
   with all the mono-and di-interstitial models. We have carefully
   performed sensitivity analysis to estimate the effect of input
   di-interstitial binding energies on the predicted diffusivities and
   activation energies. While this article only discusses mono-and
   di-interstitials in evaluating oxygen diffusion response in UO2+x,
   future improvements to the model will primarily focus on including
   energetic definitions of larger stable interstitial clusters reported in
   the literature. The addition of larger clusters to the kMC model is
   expected to improve the comparison of oxygen transport in UO2+x with
   experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale electromechanical wireless communication with on-off keying in
   the very high frequency (VHF) band (30-300 MHz) is studied for a
   receiver using a carbon nanotube (CNT). Previous studies on this topic
   have only considered continuous wave (CW) on-off keying which suffers
   from spectral widening due to sharp changes in the signal. Effects of
   the inter-symbol interference (ISI), the co-channel interference, and
   the adjacent channel interference on the received signal statistics have
   not been analyzed. The rise-and fall-times associated with the filtering
   of the incoming signal by the mechanical frequency response of the
   receiver's CNT have also been ignored. In this paper, Fourier-series
   based modeling and statistical analysis of decision variables are
   performed. The results and modeling in this study enable performance
   evaluation of CNT based receivers with an arbitrary number of
   interfering signals with arbitrary pulse shapes, and fully incorporates
   the transient signal components. Received signal statistics under
   interference are derived using the developed model. Numerical results
   are presented for Hanning pulse and trapezoidal pulse (which includes
   rectangular pulses corresponding to CW as a special case). The required
   guard intervals between pulses to mitigate ISI, required frequency
   separation between channels, and required spatial separation of
   co-channel networks (frequency reuse distance) are shown. These results
   show that large frequency reuse distance is required, limiting efficient
   spectrum utilization. However, the ISI and adjacent channel interference
   can be controlled more easily with a proper selection of parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A unique high-speed electromagnetic tribometer based on a minor caliber
   electromagnetic launcher was used to study metal on metal wear under
   high sliding speeds and high contact pressures. Large scale melting of

   series of experiments were conducted to study the response of a 6061-T6
   aluminum slider on four different guider materials, C11000-H2 copper,
   1018 steel, 1045 steel and CP titanium (grade 2) at sliding speeds from
   0 to 1200 m/s and contact pressures from 100 to 225 MPa. A transition
   from a severe plastic deformation to melt lubrication wear region
   occurred under a critical combination of sliding speed and contact
   pressure. Test results showed that the guider thermal properties
   influenced this transition condition, such that a guider with a higher
   volumetric thermal mass resulted in a higher transition condition than
   one with a lower volumetric thermal mass. The overall impact of the
   different guider materials tested on the transition condition is within
   6\% of the baseline C11000-H2 copper. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the cotransport of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu in
   porous media. The impacts of GO concentration and ion strength (IS) on
   Cu transport in laboratory packed columns were investigated. The results
   indicated that GO had fairly high mobility at a IS of 1 mM, and could
   serve as an effective carrier of Cu(II). The facilitated transport was
   found to increase with increasing concentration of GO (C-GO). The peak
   effluent concentration (C/C-0)(max) of Cu was 0.57 at C-GO of 120 mg/L
   and IS = 1 mM and 0.13 at 40 mg/L and IS = 1 mM. The Cu appears to be
   irreversibly adsorbed by the sand because no Cu appeared in the effluent
   in the absence of GO. However, the GO-facilitated Cu transport was
   reduced as the IS increased from 1 to 1000 mM. In fact, the facilitated
   transport was zero percent at an IS of 1000 mM. Particle size analysis,
   Zeta potential measurements and DLVO calculations demonstrated that
   higher IS values made the GO became unstable and it flocculated and
   attached to the sand. We also fed GO into the column pre-equilibrated by
   Cu as sequential elution experiments and found that the later introduced
   GO can complex the pre-adsorbed Cu from the sand surface because GO has
   a higher adsorption affinity for Cu. An advection-dispersion-retention
   numerical model was able to describe the Cu and GO transport in the
   column. Our work provides useful insights into fate, transport and risk
   assessment of heavy metal contaminants in the presence of engineered
   nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture toughness of a composite material is not a deterministic
   property. This is primarily due to the stochastic nature of its
   microstructure as well as the activation of different fracture
   mechanisms during the crack-microstructure interactions. Although
   Weibull distribution has been widely used to determine the probability
   of material fracture, its role has been confined to fitting fracture
   toughness data rather than providing predictive insight of material
   fracture toughness and the magnitude of scatter. Besides, the Weibull
   parameters which are obtained through curve fitting carry little
   physical significance. In this paper, an analytical model is developed
   to predict fracture toughness in a statistical sense. The Weibull
   distribution parameters are correlated with the statistical measures of
   microstructure characteristics and the statistical characterization of
   the competition between crack deflection and crack penetration at
   matrix/reinforcement interfaces. Although the quantification is specific
   to Al2O3/TiB2 composites, the approach and model developed here can be
   applied to other materials. The established correlations will lead to
   more reliable material design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dielectric properties of alkali silicates ((Na,K)(2)(SiO2)(n)O) or
   `water glasses' are a critical input into the electromagnetic modeling
   of these materials, which have a broad range of applications. Recent
   increased interest in understanding geopolymerization of
   aluminosilicates with water glasses and the potential to improve
   understanding of the role of moisture in damage due to alkali-silica
   reaction (ASR) in concrete (where water glass is a suitable analogue for
   ASR gel) motivates this research. This investigation presents the
   results of microwave dielectric property measurement of twelve
   laboratory-produced (synthetic) water glass samples at X-band (8.2-12.4
   GHz). Results show an exponential decay of loss factor as a function of
   increasing silica-to-alkali ratio, suggesting a correlation with
   increase in bound water in the samples and a decrease in the fluid ionic
   concentration. The results provide an insight into the temporal changes
   of the dielectric properties of ASR-affected materials, as well as
   geopolymers. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Noble metal nanoparticles are extensively used for sensitizing metal
   oxide chemical sensors through the catalytic spillover mechanism.
   However, due to earth-scarcity and high cost of noble metals, finding
   replacements presents a great economic benefit. Besides, high
   temperature and harsh environment sensor applications demand material
   stability under conditions approaching thermal and chemical stability
   limits of noble metals. In this study, we employed thermally stable
   perovskite-type La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSFO) nanoparticle surface decoration on
   Ga2O3 nanorod array gas sensors and discovered an order of magnitude
   enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide at 500 degrees C. The LSFO
   nanoparticle catalysts was of comparable performance to that achieved by
   Pt nanoparticles, with a much lower weight loading than Pt. Detailed
   electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies
   suggested the LSFO nanoparticle sensitization effect is attributed to a
   spillover-like effect associated with the gas-LSFO-Ga2O3 triple
   interfaces that spread the negatively charged surface oxygen ions from
   LSFO nanoparticles surfaces surfaces with faster surface CO oxidation
   reactions. over to beta-Ga2O3 nanorod surfaces with faster surface CO
   oxidation reactions.}},

   terthiophene fragment for light absorption and electron injection into
   TiO2, and a terminal trpy ligand for the construction of assemblies

Abstract = {{Chemically functional microporous metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals
   are attractive for filtration and gas storage applications, and recent
   results show that they can be immobilized on high surface area
   substrates, such as fiber mats. However, fundamental knowledge is still
   lacking regarding initial key reaction steps in thin film MOF nucleation
   and growth. We find that thin inorganic nucleation layers formed by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) can promote solvothermal growth of copper
   benzenetricarboxylate MOF (Cu-BTC) on various substrate surfaces. The
   nature of the ALD material affects the MOF nucleation time, crystal size
   and morphology, and the resulting MOF surface area per unit mass. To
   understand MOF nucleation mechanisms, we investigate detailed Cu-BTC MOF
   nucleation behavior on metal oxide powders and Al2O3, ZnO, and TiO2
   layers formed by ALD on polypropylene substrates. Studying both combined
   and sequential MOF reactant exposure conditions, we find that during
   solvothermal synthesis ALD metal oxides can react with the MOF metal
   precursor to form double hydroxy salts that can further convert to
   Cu-BTC MOF. The acidic organic linker can also etch or react with the
   surface to form MOF from an oxide metal source, which can also function
   as a nucleation agent for Cu-BTC in the mixed solvothermal solution. We
   discuss the implications of these results for better controlled thin
   film MOF nucleation and growth.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an efficient fused-ring electron acceptor (ITIC-Th) based on
   indacenodithieno {[}3,2-b]-thiophene core and thienyl side-chains for
   organic solar cells (OSCs). Relative to its counterpart with phenyl
   side-chains (ITIC), ITIC-Th shows lower energy levels (ITIC-Th: HOMO =
   -5.66 eV, LUMO =-3.93 eV; ITIC: HOMO = -5.48 eV, LUMO =-3.83 eV) due to
   the a-inductive effect of thienyl side-chains, which can match with
   high-performance narrow-band-gap polymer donors and wide-band-gap
   polymer donors. ITIC-Th has higher electron mobility (6.1 X 10(-4) cm(2)
   V-1 s(-1)) than ITIC (2.6 X 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) due to enhanced
   intermolecular interaction induced by sulfur-sulfur interaction. We
   fabricate OSCs by blending ITIC-Th acceptor with two different
   low-band-gap and wide-band-gap polymer donors. In one case, a power
   conversion efficiency of 9.6\% was observed, which rivals some of the
   highest efficiencies for single junction OSCs based on fullerene
   acceptors.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a theoretical design study of a novel
   three-dimensional micromachined hemispherical shell antenna for
   ultra-wideband millimetre-wave imaging applications. The antenna is
   composed of a hemispherical metallic shell which is suspended on top of
   a high-resistivity silicon substrate using a thin silicon stem. The
   antenna exhibits two different operational modes and an exceptionally
   wide bandwidth of more than 80 GHz at the centre frequency of 120 GHz.
   Simulation results indicate that the antenna performance is highly
   sensitive to geometrical variations and hence to fabrication
   inaccuracies. Performing a complete sensitivity analysis using full-wave
   simulations requires numerous simulation steps and is therefore
   time-intensive and impractical. This study provides closed-form
   solutions for all performance metrics of the antenna, followed by a
   comprehensive theoretical-based sensitivity analysis for evaluating the
   effects of fabrication imperfections on its bandwidth. The antenna
   structure is then calibrated for ultra-wideband operations and low
   sensitivities to fabrication inaccuracies.}},

Title = {{Multi-shape active composites by 3D printing of digital shape memory
   polymers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Recent research using 3D printing to create active structures has added
   an exciting new dimension to 3D printing technology. After being
   printed, these active, often composite, materials can change their shape
   over time; this has been termed as 4D printing. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the design and manufacture of active composites that can
   take multiple shapes, depending on the environmental temperature. This
   is achieved by 3D printing layered composite structures with multiple
   families of shape memory polymer (SMP) fibers - digital SMPs - with
   different glass transition temperatures (T-g) to control the
   transformation of the structure. After a simple single-step
   thermomechanical programming process, the fiber families can be
   sequentially activated to bend when the temperature is increased. By
   tuning the volume fraction of the fibers, bending deformation can be
   controlled. We develop a theoretical model to predict the deformation
   behavior for better understanding the phenomena and aiding the design.
   We also design and print several flat 2D structures that can be
   programmed to fold and open themselves when subjected to heat. With the
   advantages of an easy fabrication process and the controllable
   multi-shape memory effect, the printed SMP composites have a great
   potential in 4D printing applications.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the oligothiophene length of two thiophene-isoindigo
   copolymers on film morphology, charge transfer, and photovoltaic device
   performance are reported. Despite the similarities in their repeat unit
   structures, the two polymers show distinctly different film morphologies
   and photovoltaic performance upon blending with PC71BM. We found that
   there is a significant increase in the dielectric constant of the
   photoactive film upon blending fullerene with the polymer that exhibits
   a higher power conversion efficiency. Blend photoluminescence transients
   revealed a fast dissociation route in the better performing polymer
   followed by a slower decay. The fast decay in transient PL is attributed
   to a higher charge transfer efficiency when blending with the fullerene.
   We suggest that the charge transfer efficiency is determined not only by
   the microscopic morphology but also whether the polymer can accommodate
   the fullerene molecules in close proximity to the acceptor moiety to
   facilitate electronic coupling between the isoindigo acceptor and the
   fullerene molecule. We propose that the fast decay component seen in
   transient PL for the better performing polymer, along with the increase
   in dielectric constant, is a signature of enhanced electronic coupling
   between the polymer and the fullerene. The enhanced electronic coupling
   is thought to originate from a polymer chemical structure which allows
   the fullerene molecules to come to closer proximity for more efficient
   charge transfer.}},

Abstract = {{A principal goal of cancer nanomedicine is to deliver therapeutics
   effectively to cancer cells within solid tumors. However, there are a
   series of biological barriers that impede nanomedicine from reaching
   target cells. Here, we report a stimuli-responsive clustered
   nanoparticle to systematically overcome these multiple barriers by
   sequentially responding to the endogenous attributes of the tumor
   microenvironment. The smart polymeric clustered nanoparticle (iCluster)
   has an initial size of similar to 100 nm, which is favorable for long
   blood circulation and high propensity of extravasation through tumor
   vascular fenestrations. Once iCluster accumulates at tumor sites, the
   intrinsic tumor extracellular acidity would trigger the discharge of
   platinum prodrug-conjugated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (diameter
   similar to 5 nm). Such a structural alteration greatly facilitates tumor
   penetration and cell internalization of the therapeutics. The
   internalized dendrimer prodrugs are further reduced intracellularly to
   release cisplatin to kill cancer cells. The superior in vivo antitumor
   activities of iCluster are validated in varying intractable tumor models
   including poorly permeable pancreatic cancer, drug-resistant cancer, and
   metastatic cancer, demonstrating its versatility and broad
   applicability.}},

Abstract = {{The key to utilizing quantum dots (QDs) as lasing media is to
   effectively reduce non-radiative processes, such as Auger recombination
   and surface trapping. A robust strategy to craft a set of
   CdSe/Cd1-xZnxSe1-ySy/ZnS core/graded shell-shell QDs with suppressed
   re-absorption, reduced Auger recombination rate, and tunable Stokes
   shift is presented. In sharp contrast to conventional CdSe/ZnS QDs,
   which have a large energy level mismatch between CdSe and ZnS and thus
   show strong re-absorption and a constrained Stokes shift, the
   as-synthesized CdSe/Cd1-xZnxSe1-ySy/ZnS QDs exhibited the suppressed
   re-absorption of CdSe core and tunable Stokes shift as a direct
   consequence of the delocalization of the electron wavefunction over the
   entire QD. Such Stokes shift-engineered QDs with suppressed
   re-absorption may represent an important class of building blocks for
   use in lasers, light emitting diodes, solar concentrators, and
   parity-time symmetry materials and devices.}},

Abstract = {{We firstly designed an electrochemical system for dealloying to
   synthesize nanoporous gold (NPG) and also driving the novel NPG based
   actuator by utilizing a modified rotary triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG). Compared to the previous reported TENG whose outputs decline due
   to temperature rising resulting from electrodes friction, the modified
   TENG with a cooling system has stable output current and voltage
   increased by 14\% and 20\%, respectively. The novel cantilevered hybrid
   actuator characterised by light-weight (ca. 3 mg) and small volume (ca.
   30 mm x 2 mm x 10 mu m) is driven by a microcontroller modulated TENG
   with the displacement of 2.2 mm, which is about 10(6) times larger than
   that of traditional cantilever using planar surfaces. The energy
   conversion efficiencies defined as the energy consumed during dealloying
   and actuation compared with the output of TENG are 47\% and 56.7\%,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess and compare in vivo
   the restoration of vasomotor function following Absorb bioresorbable
   vascular scaffold (BVS) (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) and
   metallic Xience V (XV) (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) stent
   implantations in porcine coronary arteries at 1 and 2 years.
   BACKGROUND Drug-eluting metallic coronary stents induce sustained
   vasomotor dysfunction, and preliminary observations from arteries with
   bioresorbable scaffolds have indicated partially restored
   vasoreactivity.
   METHODS A total of 15 Absorb BVS (3.0 x 18.0 mm) and 14 XV (3.0 x 18.0
   mm or 3.0 x 12.0 mm) stents were randomly implanted in the main
   coronaries of 12 nonatherosclerotic swine. The effect of implant on
   vasomotor performance (constrictive and expansive) was measured in the
   stented/scaffolded segments and the 5-mm proximal and distal adjacent
   segments in vivo by angiography assessing mean luminal diameter changes
   following infusion of vasoactive agents at 1 year (n = 6) and 2 years (n
   = 6) as well as ex vivo at 2 years using a tissue chamber apparatus.
   Endothelial cell function and smooth muscle cell phenotype gene marker
   levels were evaluated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain
   reaction.
   RESULTS The scaffolded Absorb BVS segments showed fully restored
   constrictive response compared with XV implanted vessels at 1 year:
   -24.30 +/- 14.31\% versus -1.79 +/- 6.57\% (p < 0.004) and at 2 years:
   -28.13 +/- 14.60\% versus -3.90 +/- 6.44\% (p < 0.004). The early
   restoration of vasomotor function within the scaffolded segments reached
   a peak at 1 year and did not significantly change up to 2 years. The
   vasoactive responses of Absorb BVS-implanted vessels within the
   scaffolded segments were similar to those observed within the proximal
   and distal edge segments at both time points. Conversely, the stented XV
   segments demonstrated significantly impaired constrictive response
   compared with the distal XV edges at 1 year: -1.79 +/- 6.57\% versus
   -21.89 +/- 7.17\% (p < 0.0002) and at 2 years: -3.90 +/- 6.44\% versus
   -21.93 +/- 15.60\% (p < 0.03). Ex vivo assessment of contraction induced
   by PGF2a and relaxation induced by substance P of isolated BVS segments
   compared with XV-treated segments generated greater contraction force of
   3.94 +/- 0.97 g versus 1.83 +/- 1.03 g (p < 0.05), and
   endothelial-dependent relaxation reached 35.91 +/- 24.74\% versus 1.20
   +/- 3.79\% (p < 0.01). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
   gene analysis at 2 years demonstrated increased Connexin 43 messenger
   ribonucleic acid levels of Absorb BVS-treated vessels compared with
   XV-treated vessels: 1.92 +/- 0.23 versus 0.77 +/- 12 (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Absorb BVS-implanted coronary arteries demonstrate early functional
   restoration of the scaffolded and adjacent segments at 1 year, which is
   preserved up to 2 years. (C) 2016 by the American College of Cardiology

Abstract = {{Strain effects have a significant role in mediating classic
   ferroelectric behavior such as polarization switching and domain wall
   dynamics. These effects are of critical relevance if the ferroelectric
   order parameter is coupled to strain and is therefore, also
   ferroelastic. Here, switching spectroscopy piezoresponse force
   microscopy (SS-PFM) is combined with control of applied tip pressure to
   exert direct control over the ferroelastic and ferroelectric switching
   events, a modality otherwise unattainable in traditional PFM. As a proof
   of concept, stress-mediated SS-PFM is applied toward the study of
   polarization switching events in a lead zirconate titanate thin film,
   with a composition near the morphotropic phase boundary with co-existing
   rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. Under increasing applied pressure,
   shape modification of local hysteresis loops is observed, consistent
   with a reduction in the ferroelastic domain variants under increased
   pressure. These experimental results are further validated by phase
   field simulations. The technique can be expanded to explore more complex
   electromechanical responses under applied local pressure, such as
   probing ferroelectric and ferroelastic piezoelectric nonlinearity as a
   function of applied pressure, and electro-chemo-mechanical response
   through electrochemical strain microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{We present, herein, visible-light water splitting using earth-abundant
   zirconium-based nanostructured photoanodes. ZrO2/ZrON core/shell arrays
   were fabricated via the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of various ZrN
   layers on anodically synthesized hexagonal ZrO2 nanotubes. Compositional
   analysis of the composite photoanodes showed the transformation of the
   nitride layers to oxynitride phases, with the sample made of 95 ALD
   cycles having a structure nearest to stoichiometry. Optical analysis
   showed visible light absorption within the oxynitride layers with an
   estimated band gap of 2.6 eV, as compared to 3.8 eV for the bare oxide
   nanotubes. This decrease in band gap was attributed to the cathodic
   shift of the valence band maximum (VBM), as confirmed by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy valence band and photoluminescence spectra.
   The core/shell photoanodes made of 10-95 cycles of ZrN showed
   photocurrent enhancements over the bare nanotubes, with samples having
   95 ALD cycles exhibiting a photocurrent density of 1.2 mA/cm(2) at an
   applied potential of 1 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode under AM 1.5
   illumination. Further increase in deposition cycles resulted in
   photocurrent deterioration, which was attributed to the increased
   surface states. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) revealed
   electron lifetimes in the core/shell electrodes that are 2 orders of
   magnitude longer than those in the bare oxide nanotube samples. Finally,
   Mott-Schottky analysis confirmed the cathodic shift of the valence band
   maximum, as evidenced by a very small anodic shift in the conduction
   band minimum. The results attained in this study compose a step toward
   earth-abundant, visible-light absorbing photoanodes for solar water
   splitting.}},

Abstract = {{Tunneling devices based on vertical hetero-structures of graphene and
   other 2D materials can overcome the low on-off ratios typically observed
   in planar graphene field-effect transistors. This study addresses the
   impact of processing conditions on two-dimensional materials in a fully
   integrated heterostructure device fabrication process. In this paper,
   graphene-molybdenum disulfide-graphene tunneling heterostructures were
   fabricated using only large-area synthesized materials, unlike previous
   studies that used small exfoliated flakes. The MoS2 tunneling barrier is
   either synthesized on a sacrificial substrate and transferred to the
   bottom-layer graphene or synthesized directly on CVD graphene. The
   presence of graphene was shown to have no impact on the quality of the
   grown MoS2. The thickness uniformity of MoS2 grown on graphene and SiO2
   was found to be 1.8 +/- 0.22 nm. XPS and Raman spectroscopy are used to
   show how the MoS2 synthesis process introduces defects into the graphene
   structure by incorporating sulfur into the graphene. The incorporation
   of sulfur was shown to be greatly reduced in the absence of molybdenum
   suggesting molybdenum acts as a catalyst for sulfur incorporation.
   Tunneling simulations based on the Bardeen transfer Hamiltonian were
   performed and compared to the experimental tunneling results. The
   simulations show the use of MoS2 as a tunneling barrier suppresses
   contributions to the tunneling current from the conduction band. This is
   a result of the observed reduction of electron conduction within the
   graphene sheets.}},

Abstract = {{The cortical local field potential (LFP) is a common measure of
   population activity, but its relationship to synaptic activity in
   individual neurons is not fully established. This relationship has been
   typically studied during anesthesia and is obscured by shared slow
   fluctuations. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings in visual cortex of
   anesthetized and awake mice to measure intracellular activity; we then
   applied a simple method to reveal its coupling to the simultaneously
   recorded LFP. LFP predicted membrane potential as accurately as synaptic
   currents, indicating a major role for synaptic currents in the
   relationship between cortical LFP and intracellular activity. During
   anesthesia, cortical LFP predicted excitation far better than
   inhibition; during wakefulness, it predicted them equally well, and
   visual stimulation further enhanced predictions of inhibition. These
   findings reveal a central role for synaptic currents, and especially
   inhibition, in the relationship between the subthreshold activity of
   individual neurons and the cortical LFP during wakefulness.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic Janus particles are currently receiving great attention as
   ``solid surfactants{''}. Previous studies have introduced such particles
   with a variety of shapes and functions, but there has so far been a
   strong emphasis on water-dispersible particles that mimic the molecular
   surfactants soluble in polar solvents; Here we present an example of
   lipophilic Janus particles which are selectively dispersible in very
   nonpolar solvents such as alkanes. Interfacial tension measurements
   between the alkane dispersions and pure water indicate that these
   particles do have interfacial activity, and like typical hydrophobic,
   nonionic surfactants, they do not partition to the aqueous bulk. We also
   show that the oil-borne particles, by retaining locally polar domains
   where charges can reside, generate electric conductivity in nonpolar
   liquids-another feature familiar from molecular surfactants and one
   commonly exploited to mitigate explosion hazards due to flow
   electrification during petroleum pumping and in the formulation of
   electronic inks.}},

Title = {{The hydrodynamics of surface tidal flow exchange in saltmarshes}},
Journal = {{ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{128-137}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Modeling studies of estuary circulation show great sensitivity to the
   water exchange into and out of adjacent marshes, yet there is
   significant uncertainty in resolving the processes governing marsh
   surface flow. The objective of this study is to measure the estuary
   channel-to-saltmarsh pressure gradient and to guide parameterization for
   how it affects the surface flow in the high marsh. Current meters and
   high resolution pressure transducers were deployed along a transect
   perpendicular to the nearby Little Ogeechee River in a saltmarsh
   adjacent to Rose Dhu Island near Savannah, Georgia, USA. The vertical
   elevations of the transducers were surveyed with static GPS to yield
   high accuracy water surface elevation data. It is found that water level
   differences between the Little Ogeechee River and neighboring saltmarsh
   are up to 15 cm and pressure gradients are up to 0.0017 in of water
   surface elevation change per m of linear distance during rising and
   falling tides. The resulting Little-Ogeechee-River-to-saltmarsh pressure
   gradient substantially affects tidal velocities at all current meter
   locations. At the velocity measurement station located closest to the
   Little Ogeechee River bank, the tidal velocity is nearly perpendicular
   to the bank. At this location, surface flow is effectively modeled as a
   balance between the pressure gradient force and the drag force due to
   marsh vegetation and bottom stress using the Darcy Weisbach/Lindner's
   equations developed for flow-through-vegetation analysis in open channel
   flow. The study thus provides a direct connection between the pressure
   gradient and surface flow velocity in the high marsh, thereby overcoming
   a long-standing barrier in directly relating flow-through-saltmarsh
   studies to flow-through-vegetation studies in the open channel flow
   literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel tribotronic transistor has been developed by vertically coupling
   a single-electrode mode triboelectric nanogenerator and a MoS2 field
   effect transistor. Once an external material contacts with or separates
   from the device, negative charges are induced by triboelectrification on
   the surface of the polymer frictional layer, which act as a gate voltage
   to modulate the carrier transport in the MoS2 channel instead of the
   conventional applied gate voltage; the drain-source current can be tuned
   in the range of 1.56-15.74 A, for nearly ten times. The application of
   this MoS2 tribotronic transistor for the active smart tactile switch is
   also demonstrated, in which the on/off ratio can reach as high as
   approximate to 16 when a finger touches the device and the increased
   drain-source current is sufficient to light two light-emitting diodes.
   This work may provide a technique route to utilize the 2D materials
   based tribotronic transistors in MEMS, nanorobotics, and human-machine
   interfacing.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations of ambient air pollution health effects rely on complete
   and accurate spatiotemporal air pollutant estimates. Three methods are
   developed for fusing ambient monitor measurements and 12 km resolution
   chemical transport model (CMAQ) simulations to estimate daily air
   pollutant concentrations across Georgia. Temporal variance is determined
   by observations in one method, with the annual mean CMAQ field providing
   spatial structure. A second method involves scaling daily CMAQ simulated
   fields using mean observations to reduce bias. Finally, a weighted
   average of these results based on prediction of temporal variance
   provides optimized daily estimates for each 12 X 12 km grid. These
   methods were applied to daily metrics of 12 pollutants (CO, NO2, NOx,
   O-3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5 and five PM2.5 components) over the state of
   Georgia for a seven-year period (2002-2008). Cross-validation
   demonstrates a wide range in optimized model performance across
   pollutants, with SO2 predicted most poorly due to limitations in coal
   combustion plume monitoring and modeling. For the other pollutants
   studied, 54-88\% of the spatiotemporal variance (Pearson R-2 from
   cross-validation) was captured, with ozone and PM2.5 predicted best. The
   optimized fusion approach developed provides daily spatial field
   estimates of air pollutant concentrations and uncertainties that are
   consistent with observations, emissions, and meteorology.}},

Abstract = {{Subject reactivity-when research participants change their behavior in
   response to being observed-has been documented showing the effect of
   human observers. Electronics sensors are increasingly used to monitor
   environmental health interventions, but the effect of sensors on
   behavior has not been assessed. We conducted a cluster randomized
   controlled trial in Rwanda among 170 households (70 blinded to the
   presence of the sensor, 100 open) testing whether awareness of an
   electronic monitor would result in a difference in weekly use of
   household water filters and improved cookstoves over a four-week
   surveillance period. A 63\% increase in number of uses of the water
   filter per week between the groups was observed in week 1, an average of
   4.4 times in the open group and 2.83 times in the blind group, declining
   in week 4 to an insignificant 55\% difference of 2.82 uses in the open,
   and 1.93 in the blind. There were no significant differences in the
   number of stove uses per week between the two groups. For both filters
   and stoves, use decreased in both groups over four-week installation
   periods. This study suggests behavioral monitoring should attempt to
   account for reactivity to awareness of electronic monitors that persists
   for weeks or more.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation of mechanical behavior of discontinuously reinforced
   composites containing randomly oriented short-fibers/whiskers presents
   an attractive opportunity for reduction of the number of experiments and
   resources required for microstructure design of such advanced materials.
   It is desirable to perform such simulations using microstructure model
   that accounts for randomness in angular orientations and locations of
   the short fibers/whiskers. In this contribution, a methodology is
   presented for efficient simulation of the required microstructural model
   through modification of well-known random sequential adsorption (RSA)
   algorithm for microstructure simulation through its application to the
   microstructure of Mg-alloy matrix composite containing randomly oriented
   short carbon fibers. The modified RSA algorithm enhances accuracy and
   efficiency of the complex geometric details of the randomly oriented
   short-fiber reinforced composite microstructure. Simulated
   microstructural model of composite is implemented in ABAQUS to simulate
   the mechanical response of the Mg-matrix composite containing randomly
   oriented short carbon fibers. The generated complex microstructure model
   in ABAQUS code is sliced into thin slices for reducing computing
   resources. The simulated results from multiple sliced models were
   averaged to approximate the result for the full volume element. The
   simulated mechanical response by use of multiple sliced models is
   validated via comparison with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bioluminescent reporters in neuroscience research continues
   to grow at a rapid pace as their applications and unique advantages over

   describe practical methods and principles for detecting and imaging

   various components of our conventional fluorescence microscope to
   optimize it for long-term bioluminescence imaging. High-resolution
   bioluminescence images from live neurons were obtained with our
   microscope setup, which could be continuously captured for several hours
   with no signs of phototoxicity. Bioluminescence from the mouse brain was
   also imaged noninvasively through the intact skull with a conventional
   luminescence imager. These methods demonstrate how bioluminescence can
   be routinely detected and measured from live cells and animals in a
   cost-effective way with common reagents and equipment. (C) The Authors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of
   cardiopulmonary mechanical life support for critically ill patients.
   ECMO is burdened by both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications.
   Recently there has been a clinical shift from roller pumps to
   centrifugal pumps. In this study, we report on bulk thrombus formation
   within pumps recovered from clinical use. We then replicate this
   thrombus formation in vitro.
   Methods: Clinical pediatric ECMO circuits driven with the Sorin
   Revolution were collected from 16 patients. The location and extent of
   thrombus formation in the pumps were recorded. Pump heads were also
   tested in a laboratory circulatory loop. The location, extent, and
   appearance of the thrombi were recorded. Thrombi were examined
   histologically using Carstairs' stain.
   Results: Gross thrombus was observed in all pump heads at the stainless
   steel bearing at the inlet. In 19\% of the pumps larger thrombi grew
   into the head over the cone and along the vanes. The thrombi were
   adherent and cohesive upon extraction. The thrombus formation was
   strikingly similar between the clinical pump heads and in vitro pump
   heads. Histology of both clinical and experimental samples exhibited a
   platelet-rich thrombus.
   Conclusions: Our studies have revealed platelet-rich thrombus in
   clinical and in vitro circuits. The location and composition of the
   thrombi suggest that the exposed metal shaft was initially covered by
   contact activated coagulation followed by large-scale growth by rapid
   platelet accumulation from high shear rates at the inlet. The in vitro
   system may be used to further identify the mechanisms for pump thrombus
   and test new designs.}},

Abstract = {{To improve system capacity, licensed-assisted access (LAA) has been
   proposed for long-term evolution (LTE) systems to use unlicensed bands.
   However, the energy efficiency (EE) of the LTE system may be degraded by
   LAA since unlicensed bands are generally less energy-efficient than
   licensed bands. In this paper, we investigate the EE optimization of LAA
   systems. We first develop a criterion to determine whether unlicensed
   bands can be leveraged to improve the EE of LAA systems. We prove that
   unlicensed bands can be used to improve the EE only when the allocated
   licensed resource blocks (RBs) are not enough. We then investigate joint
   licensed and unlicensed RB allocation to maximize the EE of each small
   cell base station (SBS) in a multi-SBS scenario, taking into account
   fair resource sharing between LTE and WiFi networks. The complete Pareto
   optimal EE set can be obtained by the weighted Tchebycheff method. We
   also develop an algorithm to provide fair EE among different SBSs based
   on the Nash bargaining solution. Numerical results are presented to
   confirm our analysis and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Repair of non-healing bone defects through tissue engineering strategies
   remains a challenging feat in the clinic due to the aversive
   microenvironment surrounding the injured tissue. The vascular damage
   that occurs following a bone injury causes extreme ischemia and a loss
   of circulating cells that contribute to regeneration. Tissue-engineered
   constructs aimed at regenerating the injured bone suffer from
   complications based on the slow progression of endogenous vascular
   repair and often fail at bridging the bone defect. To that end, various
   strategies have been explored to increase blood vessel regeneration
   within defects to facilitate both tissue-engineered and natural repair
   processes. Developments that induce robust vascularization will need to
   consolidate various parameters including optimization of embedded
   therapeutics, scaffold characteristics, and successful integration
   between the construct and the biological tissue. This review provides an
   overview of current strategies as well as new developments in
   engineering biomaterials to induce reparation of a functional vascular
   supply in the context of bone repair.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used extracellular matrix (ECM) gels and human bone
   allograft as matrix vehicles to deliver the sphingolipid growth factor
   FTY720 to rodent models of tibial fracture and a critical-sized cranial
   defect. We show that FTY720 released from injectable ECM gels may
   accelerate callous formation and resolution and bone volume in a mouse
   tibial fracture model. We then show that FTY720 binds directly to human
   trabecular allograft bone and releases over 1 week in vitro. Rat
   critical-sized cranial defects treated with FTY720-coated grafts show
   increases in vascularization and bone deposition, with histological and
   micro-computed topography (microCT) evidence of enhanced bone formation
   within the graft and defect void. Immunohistochemical analysis suggests
   that osteogenesis within FTY720-coated grafts is associated with reduced
   CD68(+) macrophage infiltration and recruitment of CD29(+) bone
   progenitor cells. Matrix binding of FTY720 thus represents a promising
   and robust bone regeneration strategy with potential clinical
   translatability.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymer (BCP)
   methods still yield defect densities orders of magnitude higher than is
   necessary in semiconductor fabrication. The defect free energy of a
   dislocation pair or jog defect, one of the most common defects found in
   BCP-DSA, is calculated via thermodynamic integration using a
   coarse-grained molecular dynamics model as a function of chi and the
   degree of polymerization (N). It is found that chi N is not the best
   predictor of defect free energy and that a single chi N value can yield
   vastly different free energies when chi and N are different. Defect free
   energy was highly dependent on defect location relative to the
   underlayer, and free energy differences similar to 100 kT were found
   among the three possible defect locations on a 1: 3 guiding pattern. It
   was found that increasing molar mass dispersity (D) significantly
   reduced defect free energy. Extrapolating from D up to 1.5 suggests that
   the defect will occur in equal proportions to the defect free state at a
   D of around 1.6 for this system. It was found that long chains tended to
   concentrate near the defect and stabilize the defect. (C) 2016 Society

Abstract = {{Computational tools for aiding design-by-analogy have focused on
   function-flow and keyword-based retrieval of analogues. Because of the
   critical role of performance and benchmarking in design, the need for
   performance metrics-driven analogy retrieval is currently unmet. Towards
   meeting this need, a study has been done to investigate and propose a
   combined framework for organising the myriad of technical performance
   metrics used in engineering design (e.g. efficiency, cost, weight,
   etc.). Such organisational frameworks are needed for the implementation
   of a computational tool which can retrieve relevant analogies using
   performance metrics. The study, which takes a deductive approach,
   defines a hierarchical taxonomy of performance metrics akin to the
   Functional Basis vocabulary of function and flow terms. To support this
   approach, an empirical study was conducted to verify the identification
   of criticality with use in analogy designs.}},

   Velocity and density asymmetry effects}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the hydrodynamic stability of bluff body wakes with
   non-uniform mean density, asymmetric mean density, and velocity
   profiles. This work is motivated by experiments {[}S. Tuttle et al.,
   ``Lean blow off behavior of asymmetrically-fueled bluff body-stabilized
   flames,{''} Combust. Flame 160, 1677 (2013)], which investigated
   reacting wakes with equivalence ratio stratification and, hence,
   asymmetry in the base flow density profiles. They showed that highly
   stratified cases exhibited strong, narrowband oscillations, suggestive
   of global hydrodynamic instability. In this paper, we present a local
   hydrodynamic stability analysis for non-uniform density wakes that
   includes base flow asymmetry. The results show that increasing the
   degree of base density asymmetry generally has a destabilizing effect
   and that increasing base velocity asymmetry tends to be stabilizing.
   Furthermore, we show that increasing base density asymmetry slightly
   decreases the absolute frequency and that increasing the base velocity
   asymmetry slightly increases the absolute frequency. In addition, we
   show that increasing the degree of base density asymmetry distorts the
   most absolutely unstable hydrodynamic mode from its nominally sinuous
   structure. This distorted mode exhibits higher amplitude pressure and
   velocity oscillations near the interface with the smaller density jump
   than near the one with the bigger density jump. This would then be
   anticipated to lead to strongly non-symmetric amplitudes of flame
   flapping, with much stronger flame flapping on the side with lower
   density ratio. These predictions are shown to be consistent with
   experimental data. These comparisons support the analytical predictions
   that increased base density asymmetry are destabilizing and that
   hydrodynamic velocity fluctuation amplitudes should be greatest at the
   flame with the lowest density jump. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{There is a recent surge in research activities around ``deep neural
   networks{''} (DNN). While the notion of neural networks have enjoyed
   cycles of enthusiasm, which may continue its ebb and flow, concrete
   advances now abound. Significant performance improvements have been
   shown in a number of pattern recognition tasks. As a technical topic,
   DNN is important in classes and tutorial articles and related learning
   resources are available. Streams of questions, nonetheless, never
   subside from students or researchers and there appears to be a
   frustrating tendency among the learners to treat DNN simply as a black
   box. This is an awkward and alarming situation in education. This paper
   thus has the intent to help the reader to properly understand DNN, not
   just its mechanism(what and how) but its motivation and justification
   (why). It is written from a developmental perspective with a
   comprehensive view, from the very basic but oft-forgotten principle of
   statistical pattern recognition and decision theory, through the problem
   stages that may be encountered during system design, to key ideas that
   led to the new advance. This paper can serve as a learning guide with
   historical reviews and important references, helpful in reaching an
   insightful understanding of the subject.}},

   for some of the most catastrophic events recorded, yet critically
   important field data related to the landslide motion and tsunami
   evolution remain lacking. Landslide-generated tsunami source and
   propagation scenarios are physically modelled in a three-dimensional
   tsunami wave basin. A unique pneumatic landslide tsunami generator was
   deployed to simulate landslides with varying geometry and kinematics.
   The landslides were generated on a planar hill slope and divergent
   convex conical hill slope to study lateral hill slope effects on the
   wave characteristics. The leading wave crest amplitude generated on a
   planar hill slope is larger on average than the leading wave crest
   generated on a convex conical hill slope, whereas the leading wave
   trough and second wave crest amplitudes are smaller. Between 1\% and
   24\% of the landslide kinetic energy is transferred into the wave train.
   Cobble landslides transfer on average 43\% more kinetic energy into the
   wave train than corresponding gravel landslides. Predictive equations
   for the offshore propagating wave amplitudes, periods, celerities and
   lengths generated by landslides on planar and divergent convex conical
   hill slopes are derived, which allow an initial rapid tsunami hazard
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Tool wear is an important limitation to machining productivity and part
   quality. In this paper, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of tools
   is demonstrated based on the machine spindle power values using the
   neural network (NN) technique. End milling tests were performed on a
   stainless steel workpiece at different spindle speeds and spindle power
   was recorded. The NN curve fitting approach with different MATLAB (TM)
   training functions was applied to the root mean square power (P-rms)
   values. Sample P-rms growth curves were generated to take into account
   uncertainty. The P-rms value in the time domain was found to be
   sensitive to tool wear. Results show a good agreement between the
   predicted and true RUL of tools. The proposed method takes into account
   the uncertainty in tool life and the percentage increase in nominal
   P-rms value during the RUL prediction. Using MATLAB (TM) on an Intel i7
   processor, the computation takes 0.5 s Thus, the method is
   computationally inexpensive and can be incorporated for real time RUL
   predictions during machining. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing

Abstract = {{Manufacturing is continuously evolving from concept development to
   methods and tools available for the production of goods for use or sale.
   Traditionally, manufacturing refers to an industrial production process
   through which raw materials are transformed into finished products to be
   sold in the market. However, these days manufacturing is considered to
   be an integrated concept at all levels from machines to production
   systems to an entire business level operation.
   Although there have been considerable developments in manufacturing
   technologies and processes, the actual scope and elements of
   manufacturing systems are complex and not adequately defined. This paper
   provides a review of both the tangible and intangible elements of
   manufacturing systems and presents a state-of-the-art survey of
   published work. It studies the evolution of research in manufacturing
   starting from past and current trends to future developments. How
   manufacturing systems have been classified is also presented. Through
   this extensive survey of the literature, future directions of this
   changing field are suggested. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing

Title = {{Finite Element Modeling of Factors Influencing Optic Nerve Head
   Deformation Due to Intracranial Pressure}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome is
   a health concern for long-duration spaceflight, and a proposed risk
   factor is elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). Our goal was to use
   finite element modeling to simulate how elevated ICP and interindividual
   differences affect tissue deformation within the optic nerve head (ONH).
   METHODS. We considered three ICP conditions: the upright and supine
   position on earth and an elevated ICP assumed to occur in chronic
   microgravity. Within each condition we used Latin hypercube sampling to
   consider a range of pressures and ONH tissue mechanical properties,
   determining the influence of each input on the following outcome
   measures: peak strains in the prelaminar tissue, lamina cribrosa, and
   retrolaminar optic nerve. Elevated strains can alter cell phenotype and
   induce tissue remodeling.
   RESULTS. Elevating ICP increased the strains in the retrolaminar optic
   nerve. Variations in IOP, ICP, and in optic nerve and lamina cribrosa
   stiffness had the strongest influence on strains within the ONH. We
   predicted that 5\% to 47\% of individuals in microgravity would
   experience peak strains in the retrolaminar optic nerve larger than
   expected on earth. Having a soft optic nerve or pia mater and elevated
   ICP were identified as risk factors for these ``extreme'' strains.
   CONCLUSIONS. Intracranial pressure and mechanical properties of the ONH
   influence the risk for experiencing extreme strains in the retrolaminar
   optic nerve. These extreme strains may activate mechanosensitive cells
   that induce tissue remodeling and are a risk factor for the development
   of VIIP. Future studies must also consider variations in ONH anatomy.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{608-619}},

Abstract = {{A facile one-step fabrication of large-area multicolored emissive
   photopatterns in mixed quantum dot-polymer films is demonstrated. This
   is in sharp contrast to the current photopatterning approaches that
   utilize only a single quantum dot (QD) component for single-color
   patterns. Strategies are presented that allow for either selective or
   collective modification of specific predetermined photoluminescent peaks
   of green and red QDs during photopattern development. These strategies
   yield novel patterns and allow for unprecedented control over how the
   color contrast of the photopattern evolves with continuous light
   illumination. These results clearly show that the evolution of the
   emission spectra of a multicolor mixed QD-polymer film can be readily
   tailored during pattern development, either by careful selection of the
   excitation wavelength or through combinations of controllably unstable
   and stable QDs with different recovery rates. Notably, these strategies
   are simple, fast, and robust, yielding high-resolution microscopic
   patterns over large areas (up to fractions of a cm(2)). Furthermore, the
   flexibility and capabilities of these strategies greatly expand the
   potential applications of multicolor emissive photopatterns,
   particularly in the areas of sensing, imaging, and lasing systems where
   it is important to exert delicate control over the intensity of selected
   colors within specific spatial regions.}},

Abstract = {{Air quality is an important factor especially in areas where humans are
   exposed to animal excrement. The selective detection of NH3, especially
   in the presence of CO provides an important means of protecting the
   health of workers in the dairy, swine, and poultry industries especially
   in enclosed barn areas. In addition, selective non-invasive detection of
   NH3 can play an important role in breath analysis especially for
   asthmatics. We assess the sensitivity of a variety of untreated and
   decorated porous silicon (PS) interfaces to NH3 at room temperature in
   the presence of carbon monoxide, toluene, benzene, and xylene.
   Interfaces, selective ranging from 10(2) 10(5) for NH3, are
   demonstrated. The reversible interaction of NH3 with a PS interface
   completely overwhelms that for CO. A SnOx-decorated PS interface is used
   to evaluate the NH3-toluene system as the much weaker toluene signal
   corresponds to that of a weak base. SnOx and AuxO(x > > 1) decorated and
   PS interfaces are used to evaluate the NH3-benzene system as a much
   weaker benzene signal corresponds to that of a weak acid. A SnOx

Abstract = {{The response of hybrid metal/composite plates subjected to water-based
   impulsive loads is analyzed using experiments and computations. The
   analysis focuses on the effect of varying material properties on
   load-carrying capacity, deflection, impulse transmission, energy
   dissipation and damage. The three structural designs studied are
   unmodified monolithic aluminum plates, unmodified monolithic composite
   plates and hybrid metal/composite laminates. The plates are
   circumferentially clamped and subjected to transverse, out-of-plane
   impulses of varying intensities. The experiments are supported by fully
   dynamic numerical simulations using a Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL)
   framework which accounts for fluid-structure interactions and damage and
   failure in the constituent materials. Results show that load intensity
   determines the deformation and failure modes. The monolithic composite
   plates exhibit large-scale in-ply cracking, delamination and shear
   rupture near the clamped edges, while the aluminum plates undergo
   plastic deformation and petalling. The hybrid metal/composite structures
   show superior blast-resistance than both types of monolithic plates in
   terms of failure loads and energy dissipation, with the stacking
   sequence of the composite and metal layers significantly influencing the

Abstract = {{This letter presents a fully differential and integrated
   transformer-based Wilkinson power divider with a broad bandwidth, low
   loss, high isolation, and an ultra-compact form factor. Two differential
   transformers connected in parallel serve as the impedance transforming
   and power combining network in the proposed Wilkinson power divider.
   Shunt capacitors are added between the output ports for matching and
   isolation enhancement. A proof-of-concept transformer-based Wilkinson
   power divider is designed at 60 GHz and implemented in a standard 130 nm
   SiGe BiCMOS process with the core chip area of 270 mu m x 107 mu m and
   the simulated 1 dB-magnitude fractional bandwidth of 64\% at the 60 GHz
   center frequency. Measurement results of 4 independent samples

Abstract = {{This letter proposes a wideband active double-pole double-throw (DPDT)
   switch for wideband phased array antennas, which realizes multi-octave
   bandwidth with positive gain and 4-way switching operation using a
   bi-directional distributed amplifier technique. Themeasured gain is
   2.0-6.0 dB and the input and output return losses are better than 9 dB
   from 2-22 GHz. The isolation is over 15 dB and the measured input P1dB
   is greater than -9.1 dBm and the output P1dB is greater than -7.8 dBm
   from 2-22 GHz. The chip size is 1.07 x 0.98 mm(2), including pads. The
   switch consumes 10 mA from a 2.5 V supply. Almost identical RF
   performance is achieved in each of the 4-way switching operations due to
   a symmetric circuit topology and careful layout. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the active DPDT switch

Abstract = {{Lower-limb prostheses provide a prime example of cyber-physical systems
   (CPSs) requiring the synergistic development of sensing, algorithms, and
   controllers. With a view towards better understanding CPSs of this form,
   this paper presents a systematic methodology using multidomain hybrid
   system models and optimization-based controllers to achieve human-like
   multicontact prosthetic walking on a custom-built prosthesis: AMPRO. To
   achieve this goal, unimpaired human locomotion data is collected and the
   nominal multicontact human gait is studied. Inspired by previous work
   which realized multicontact locomotion on the bipedal robot AMBER2, a
   hybrid system-based optimization problem utilizing the collected
   reference human gait as reference is utilized to formally design stable
   multicontact prosthetic gaits that can be implemented on the prosthesis
   directly. Leveraging control methods that stabilize bipedal walking
   robots-control Lyapunov function-based quadratic programs coupled with
   variable impedance control-an online optimization-based controller is
   formulated to realize the designed gait in both simulation and
   experimentally on AMPRO. Improved tracking and energy efficiency are
   seen when this methodology is implemented experimentally. Importantly,
   the resulting multicontact prosthetic walking captures the essentials of
   natural human walking both kinematically and kinetically.
   Note to Practitioners-Variable impedance control, as one of the most
   popular prosthetic controllers, has been used widely on powered
   prostheses with notable success. However, due to the passivity of this
   controller, heuristic feedback is required to adjust the control
   parameters for different subjects and motion modes. The end result is
   extensive testing time for users, coupled with non-optimal performance
   of prostheses. Motivated by the shortcomings in the current
   state-of-the-art, this work proposes a novel systematic
   methodology-including gait generation and optimization-based control
   based on a multidomain hybrid system-to achieve prosthetic walking for a
   given subject. This method also aims to improve control optimality and
   efficiency while potentially reducing clinical tuning. The overarching
   technology utilized in this paper is the use of nominal human
   trajectories coupled with formal models and controllers that circumvent
   the need for excessive hand-tuning. In particular, rather than using a
   prerecorded trajectory (as is common), this work takes a different
   approach by using a human-inspired optimization problem to design a
   human-like gait for the amputee automatically. The proposed optimization
   framework uses the trajectory of a healthy subject as the reference and
   is subject to specific constraints (to ensure smooth transitions, torque
   and angle limitations) such that the output gait is applicable for
   implementation on the prosthetic device directly. The results of the
   offline optimization are then utilized to synthesize an online real-time
   optimization-based feedback controller that allows for pointwise optimal
   tracking on the prosthesis, thereby improving overall efficiency. The
   experimental results in this work suggest that this approach is able to
   achieve stable human-like multicontact prosthetic walking and also
   guarantees a more balanced performance compared to other traditional
   controllers (such as PD).}},

Abstract = {{In progressive stamping processes, condition monitoring based on tonnage
   signals is of great practical significance. One typical fault in
   progressive stamping processes is a missing part in one of the die
   stations due to malfunction of part transfer in the press. One
   challenging question is how to detect the fault due to the missing part
   in certain die stations as such a fault often results in die or press
   damage, but only provides a small change in the tonnage signals. To
   address this issue, this article proposes a novel automatic process
   monitoring method using the recurrence plot (RP) method. Along with the
   developed method, we also provide a detailed interpretation of the
   representative patterns in the recurrence plot. Then, the corresponding
   relationship between the RPs and the tonnage signals under different
   process conditions is fully investigated. To differentiate the tonnage
   signals under normal and faulty conditions, we adopt the recurrence
   quantification analysis (RQA) to characterize the critical patterns in
   the RPs. A parameter learning algorithm is developed to set up the
   appropriate parameter of the RP method for progressive stamping
   processes. A real case study is provided to validate our approach, and
   the results are compared with the existing literature to demonstrate the
   outperformance of this proposed monitoring method.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been invented as a new
   energy technology and widely utilized in renewable and sustainable
   energy harvesting. Here we report a regular dodecahedron device
   integrated with 12 sets of multilayer wavy-structured robust
   triboelectric nanogenerators (WS-TENGs) for harvesting water wave
   energy. Each WS-TENG is composed of a wavy structured Cu-Kapton-Cu film
   and two fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) thin films sputtered with
   metal electrodes as a sandwich structure. A hard ball is enclosed inside
   a polyhedron made by WS-TENGs as the walls; a collision of the ball with
   the WS-TENG in responding to the kinetic motion of water wave converts
   mechanical energy into electricity. A high output voltage and current of
   about 250 V and 150 mu A, respectively, are measured by a single unit of
   WS-TENGs in water. Considering the units can be connected into a net
   structure, the average output power is expected to be 0.64 MW from 1
   km(2) surface area in a depth of 5 m. By the virtues of cost effective,
   low-carbon and environmentally friendly, the development of WS-TENGs can
   be a significant step towards the large-scale water wave energy
   harvesting and have great prospects for the blue energy. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The ability to suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides in
   liquid electrolyte (LE) is emerging and scientifically challenging,
   representing an important endeavor toward successful commercialization
   of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this context, a common and
   effective strategy to address this challenge is to replace the LE with a
   gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). However, the limited ionic conductivity
   of state-of-the-art GPEs and poor electrode/GPE interfaces greatly
   restrict their implementation. Herein, we report, for the first time, a
   facile in-situ synthesis of pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA)-based
   GPE with an extremely high ionic conductivity (1.13 x 10(-2) S cm(-1)).
   Quite intriguingly, even interfaced with a bare sulfur cathode, this GPE
   rendered the resulting polymer Li-S battery with a low electrode/GPE
   interfacial resistance, high rate capacity (601.2 mA h g(-1) at 1 C) and
   improved capacity retention (81.9\% after 400 cycles at 0.5 C). These
   remarkable performances can be ascribed to the immobilization of soluble
   polysulfides imparted by PETEA-based GPE and the construction of a
   robust integrated GPE/electrode interface. Notably, due to the tight
   adhesion between the PETEA-based GPE and electrodes, a high-performance
   flexible polymer Li-S battery was successfully crafted. This work
   therefore opens up a convenient, low-cost and effective way to
   substantially enhance the capability of Li-S batteries, a key step
   toward capitalizing on GPE for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2016

   wastewater treatment using triboelectric nanogenerator}},

Abstract = {{As one of the strongest and oldest natural fibers, ramie fiber has been
   widely used for fabric production for at least six thousand years. And
   degumming is a critical procedure that has been developed to hold the
   ramie fiber's shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky luster to
   the fabric appearance. Herein, we introduce a fundamentally new working
   principle into the field of ramie fiber degumming by using the
   triboelectric effect. Resort to a water-driven triboelectric
   nanogenerator (WD-TENG), the ramie fibers degumming efficiency was
   greatly enhanced with improved fiber quality, including both surface
   morphology and mechanical properties. Furthermore, it saves the
   chemicals usage in the traditional method, which makes it a green and
   practical approach to fully remove the noncellulosic compositions from
   ramie fibers. In addition, as a systematical study, the WD-TENG was
   further employed as a sustainable power source to electrochemically
   degrade the degumming wastewater by recycling the kinetic energy from
   flowing wastewater in a self-powered manner. Under a fixed current
   output of 3.5 mA and voltage output of 10 V, the self-powered cleaning
   system was capable of cleaning up to 90\% of the pollutants in the
   wastewater in 120 min. Given the compelling features of being
   self-powered, environmentally friendly, extremely cost-effective, good
   stability, high degumming and degradation efficiency, the presented work
   renders an innovative approach for natural fiber extraction, and could
   be widely adopted as a green and innovative technology in textile
   industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate an application of a triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) as a self-powered communication unit. An
   elaborately designed TENG is used to translate a series of environmental
   triggering signals into binary digital signals and drives an electronic
   optical device to transmit binary digital data in real-time without an
   external power supply. The elaborately designed TENG is built in a
   membrane structure that can effectively drive the electronic optical
   device in a bandwidth from 1.30 to 1.65 kHz. Two typical communication
   modes (amplitude-shift keying and frequency-shift keying) are realized
   through the resonant response of TENG to different frequencies, and two
   digital signals, i.e., ``1001{''} and ``0110{''}, are successfully
   transmitted and received through this system, respectively. Hence, in
   this study, a simple but efficient method for directly transmitting
   ambient vibration to the receiver as a digital signal is established
   using an elaborately designed TENG and an optical communication
   technique. This type of the communication system, as well as the
   implementation method presented, exhibits great potential for
   applications in the smart city, smart home, password authentication, and
   so on.}},

Abstract = {{Porous carbons suffer from low specific capacitance, while

   intercalation-type lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) nanoparticles in carbon
   nanopores yielded nanocomposite materials that offer both high ion
   storage density and rapid ion transport through open and interconnected
   pore channels. The use of titanate increased both the gravimetric and
   volumetric capacity of porous carbons by more than an order of
   magnitude. High electrical conductivity of carbon and the small size of
   titanate crystals allowed the composite electrodes to achieve
   characteristic charge and discharge times comparable to that of the
   electric double-layer capacitors. The proposed composite synthesis
   methodology is simple, scalable, and applicable for a broad range of
   active intercalation materials, while the produced composite powders are
   compatible with commercial electrode fabrication processes.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator has drawn considerable attentions as a
   potential candidate for harvesting mechanical energies in our daily
   life. By utilizing the triboelectric potential generated through the
   coupling of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, the
   ``tribotronics{''} has been introduced to tune/control the charge
   carrier transport behavior of silicon-based metal-oxide-semiconductor
   field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Here, we perform a theoretical study
   of the performances of tribotronic MOSFET gated by triboelectric
   potential in two working modes through finite element analysis. The
   drain-source current dependence on contact-electrification generated
   triboelectric charges, gap separation distance, and externally applied
   bias are investigated. The in-depth physical mechanism of the
   tribotronic MOSFET operations is thoroughly illustrated by calculating
   and analyzing the charge transfer process, voltage relationship to gap
   separation distance, and electric potential distribution. Moreover, a
   tribotronic MOSFET working concept is proposed, simulated and studied
   for performing self-powered FET and logic operations. This work provides
   a deep understanding of working mechanisms and design guidance of
   tribotronic MOSFET for potential applications in
   micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), human-machine
   interface, flexible electronics, and self-powered active sensors.}},

   Possible Killer Application of Triboelectric Nanogenerator}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic generators (EMGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators
   (TENGs) are the two most powerful approaches for harvesting ambient
   mechanical energy, but the effectiveness of each depends on the
   triggering frequency. Here, after systematically comparing the
   performances of EMGs and TENGs under low frequency motion (<5 Hz), we
   demonstrated that the output performance of EMGs is proportional to the
   square of the frequency, while that of TENGs is approximately in
   proportion to the frequency. Therefore, the TENG has a much better
   performance than that of the EMG at low frequency (typically 0.1-3 Hz).
   Importantly, the extremely small output voltage of the EMG at low
   frequency makes it almost inapplicable to drive any electronic unit that
   requires a certain threshold voltage (similar to 0.2-4 V), so that most
   of the harvested energy is wasted. In contrast, a TENG has an output
   voltage that is usually high enough (>10-100 V) and independent of
   frequency so that most of the generated power can be effectively used to
   power the devices. Furthermore, a TENG also has advantages of light
   weight, low cost, and easy scale up through advanced structure designs.
   All these merits verify the possible killer application of a TENG for
   harvesting energy at low frequency from motions such as human motions
   for powering small electronics and possibly ocean waves for large-scale
   blue energy.}},

Abstract = {{We report high optical gain from freestanding, optically stable, and
   mechanically robust films that are loaded with cross-linked
   CdSe/Cd1-xZnxSe1-ySy core/alloyed shell quantum dots (QD). These solid
   films display very high net optical gain as high as 650 cm(-1) combined
   with a low pump excitation gain threshold of 44 mu J/cm(2). The
   functionalization of the QDs using short-chain bifunctional
   cross-linkers not only significantly improves the net optical gain by
   allowing for a nearly 2-fold increase in QD loading but also provides
   stable passivation of the QDs which imparts excellent thermal stability,
   mechanical robustness, and stability under harsh chemical environments.
   The gain achieved here is up to 3-fold higher than that typically
   reported for traditional drop-cast QD films. Moreover, stable
   photoluminescence over long shelf storage time is a distinguished
   characteristic of the films. The QD films fabricated here span large
   areas (several cm(2)), can be readily micropatterned and sustain
   multiple harsh chemical treatment. Furthermore, they can be readily
   transferred onto different substrates without compromising their
   structural integrity and without diminishing optical activity that opens
   the paths to design complex and robust gain-loss optical structures.}},

   Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid structures based on integration of two-dimensional (2D)
   transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with optical resonators have
   recently earned significant attention. The enhanced interaction of light
   with 2D materials in such hybrid structures can enable devices such as
   efficient light-emitting diodes and lasers. However, one of the factors
   affecting the performance of such devices is the effect of the optically
   induced heat on the optoelectronic properties of the 2D materials. In
   this study, we systematically investigate principal roots of heat
   generation in hybrid cavity-coupled few atomic-layer-thick 2D TMDC films
   under optical pumping. The optical resonator exploited here is a
   Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator, which can enhance the light-MoS2 interaction
   by a significant factor of 60 at its resonance wavelength. We have
   combined an accurate theoretical modeling with experimental Raman
   spectroscopy to determine the roots of heat generation in MoS2 films
   integrated with FP resonators. Our investigations reveal that the strong
   modulation of light absorption in the MoS2 film, induced by excitation
   of an FP cavity at its resonant frequency, plays the primary role in
   excess heat generation in 2D materials. Furthermore, through varying the
   cavity length, we show that on-resonance and off-resonance excitation of
   the cavity results in completely different temperature profiles in the
   cavity-coupled MoS2 films. Also, by changing the resonance medium of the
   FP cavity (SiO2 and air), we take into account the role of the heat
   sinking effect of the substrate in heat generation in MoS2 films. In
   this study, the temperature-dependent red-shift of the Raman spectra is
   employed to monitor the local temperature of the MoS2 films. Our results
   show the importance of the heating effect in such hybrid structures and
   represent a step forward for the design of practical hybrid optical
   devices based on layered semiconducting 2D materials.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a multidisciplinary system is ineluctably affected by
   various sources of uncertainties, which are often categorized as
   aleatory (e.g., input variability) or epistemic (e.g., model
   uncertainty). Statistical sensitivity analysis methods allow for
   studying the impact of different sources of uncertainty on system
   performance. However, epistemic model uncertainty is seldom taken into
   consideration in statistical sensitivity analysis. Applying statistical
   sensitivity analysis for a multidisciplinary system is even more
   challenging due to the complexity in system analysis as well as the
   coupling relationships between subsystems. In this paper, a
   multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis approach is presented
   to analyze the contributions from various sources of uncertainties. Both
   global and local sensitivity analyses are conducted; the former examines
   the impact of variations over the entire range of design inputs, and the
   latter compares the impacts of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties to
   facilitate resource allocation decisions for reducing system
   uncertainty. Two types of sensitivity metrics are proposed for
   multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis: the extension of
   traditional variance-based sensitivity indices and
   relative-entropy-based sensitivity indices for situations with irregular
   system performance distributions. To overcome the computational
   challenges in multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis, a
   multidisciplinary uncertainty analysis technique is employed for
   handling the complexity associated with coupling among multiple
   disciplines and propagating uncertainty across multiple levels
   (component/subsystem/system). An aircraft design problem consisting of
   three coupled disciplines is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed multidisciplinary uncertainty analysis method and
   multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis approaches.}},

   Microfluidically Directed Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells}},
Journal = {{BIORESEARCH OPEN ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The development of tissue engineered osteochondral units has been slowed
   by a number of technical hurdles associated with recapitulating their
   heterogeneous nature ex vivo. Subsequently, numerous approaches with
   respect to cell sourcing, scaffolding composition, and culture media
   formulation have been pursued, which have led to high variability in
   outcomes and ultimately the lack of a consensus bioprocessing strategy.
   As such, the objective of this study was to standardize the design
   process by focusing on differentially supporting formation of
   cartilaginous and bony matrix by a single cell source in a spatially
   controlled manner within a single material system. A cell-polymer
   solution of bovine mesenchymal stem cells and agarose was cast against
   micromolds of a serpentine network and stacked to produce tissue
   constructs containing two independent microfluidic networks. Constructs
   were fluidically connected to two controlled flow loops and supplied
   with independently tuned differentiation parameters for chondrogenic and
   osteogenic induction, respectively. Constructs receiving inductive media
   showed differential gene expression of both chondrogenic and osteogenic
   markers in opposite directions along the thickness of the construct that
   was recapitulated at the protein level with respect to collagens I, II,
   and X. A control group receiving noninductive media showed homogeneous
   expression of these biomarkers measured in lower concentrations at both
   the mRNA and protein level. This work represents an important step in
   the rational design of engineered osteochondral units through
   establishment of an enabling technology for further optimization of
   scaffolding formulations and bioprocessing conditions toward the
   production of commercially viable osteochondral tissue products.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{424-431}},

Abstract = {{Microneedle injection into the suprachoroidal space (SCS) enables
   targeted drug delivery for treatment of posterior segment diseases. This
   study sought to identify and characterize anatomical barriers to
   circumferential spread of particles in the SCS of rabbit and human
   cadaver eyes. These barriers could make targeting specific regions
   within the SCS challenging. A hollow microneedle (33-gauge, 750 mu m
   long) was used to inject fluorescent particles into albino New Zealand
   White rabbit eyes ex vivo at six different positions around the limbus
   and a limited number of conditions in vivo. SCS injections were also
   performed in human cadaver eyes 8 mm and 2 mm from the optic nerve (ON).
   Eyes were dissected and particle distribution was quantified. In rabbit
   eyes, injections made in the superior or inferior hemispheres (even when
   injected temporally immediately adjacent to the long posterior ciliary
   artery (LPCA)) did not significantly cross into the other hemisphere,
   apparently due to a barrier formed by the LPCA. The vortex veins had a
   minor effect on particle deposition, limited to only around the vortex
   vein root. In human eyes, the short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCAs)
   prevented circumferential spread towards the macula and ON. In
   conclusion, the rabbit LPCA and the human SPCA were anatomical barriers
   to particle spread within the SCS. Therefore, design of drug delivery
   protocols targeting the SCS need to account for barriers formed by
   anatomical structures in order for injected drug to reach target
   tissues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study cooperative precoder design in two-tier
   networks, consisting of a macro-cell (MC) and several small-cells (SCs).
   By exploiting multiuser Vandermonde-subspace frequency division
   multiplexing (VFDM) transmission, an MC downlink can co-exist with
   cognitive SCs. In this paper, we first propose a cooperative cross-tier
   precoder (CTP) among the transmitters in the SCs to increase the
   transmitted dimension. The cooperative CTP allows us to use more
   efficient intratier precoder (ITP) in SCs to handle intracell
   interference and improve the throughput of the cognitive system. And
   then, three ITPs, a block-diagonal zero-forcing (BD-ZF) ITP, a
   capacityachieving (CA) ITP, and a generalized MMSE channel inversion
   (GMI) ITP, are developed. Complexities of all CTPs and ITPs are
   discussed and compared. The overhead of channel state information (CSI)
   exchange is analyzed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the
   throughput improvement of the proposed schemes and to discover the
   impact of the imperfect CSI. From the complexity comparison and the
   numerical results, the GMI ITP offers a good tradeoff between complexity
   and throughput.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of inverse-mode (IM) silicon-germanium (SiGe)
   heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) for the mitigation of
   single-event transients (SETs) under large-signal operation was
   investigated in an RF down-conversion single-balanced mixer using a
   through-wafer, two-photon absorption pulsed-laser beam experiment and
   TCAD heavy-ion simulations. The IM SiGe HBTs replace conventional
   forward-mode (FM) SiGe HBTs in the differential pair, which provides
   full current steering for frequency mixing operation. Under steady-state
   conditions, the IM SiGe HBT differential pair exhibits smaller transient
   peaks with shorter durations compared to the FM SiGe HBTs. In addition,
   under the injection of a local oscillator (LO) signal with large swing,
   the IM SiGe HBTs show faster recovery (50\% reduction in the best case)
   from the impact of SETs. In the frequency domain, it is observed that IM
   SiGe HBTs produce less distortion at the output for an intermediate
   frequency below 1 GHz. Based on the performance comparison between FM
   and IM SiGe HBT down-conversion mixers, system design guidelines to
   compensate the noise figure degradation associated with using IM SiGe
   HBTs are discussed.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Abstract = {{Thermal behaviour of a porous channel with thick, solid walls featuring
   uneven wall thicknesses and asymmetric external thermal boundary
   conditions is analysed theoretically. The system is under forced
   convection and the fluid and solid phases in this configuration include
   internal heat sources with varying strengths. Two types of asymmetric
   boundary conditions are considered. These include constant but different
   prescribed temperatures on the upper and lower solid walls and a
   combination of constant heat flux and convective boundary conditions on
   the two sides of the channel. The Darcy-Brinkman model of momentum
   transport and the two-equation energy model are utilised to develop
   analytical solutions for the temperature fields and Nusselt number. A
   comprehensive parametric study is, subsequently, conducted. The results
   clearly show the pronounced effect of the internal heat sources upon the
   Nusselt number and temperature fields of the system. In particular, the
   existence of these source terms intensifies the occurrence of a
   bifurcation phenomenon in the temperature fields. In keeping with the
   recent literature, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of internal
   heat sources leads to deviations from the local thermal equilibrium.
   Nonetheless, the results imply that the extent of these deviations
   depends on the thermal boundary conditions and also the specific phase
   in which heat is generated or consumed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Intensive interest in graphene has centered on its unique 2D crystal
   lattice and remarkable properties that offer unique opportunities to
   address ever-increasing, global energy demands. The past years have
   witnessed considerable advances in the fabrication of graphene-based
   materials and significant breakthroughs in advanced energy applications.
   In this Review, two methodologies for graphene production, namely, the
   bottom-up growth from hydrocarbon precursors and the top-down
   exfoliation of graphite (to graphene) and graphite oxide (to graphene
   oxide followed by reduction) are first summarized. The advantages and
   disadvantages of these methods regarding their accessibility,
   scalability, graphene quality, and inherent properties are compared.
   Particular attention is concentrated on tailored nanostructures,
   electronic properties, and surface activities of these intriguing
   materials. The preparation of graphene-based composites containing a
   wide range of active constituents (e.g., transition metals, metal
   oxides, and conducting polymers) by in-situ hybridization and ex-situ
   recombination is also discussed with an emphasis on their
   microstructures and hybrid architectures. This Review is devoted largely
   to current developments of graphene and its derivatives and composites
   in energy conversion (i.e., polymer solar cells, dye-sensitized solar
   cells, perovskite solar cells, and fuel cells) and energy storage (i.e.,
   lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors) on the basis of their
   intrinsic attributes in improving photovoltaic and electrochemical
   performance. By critically evaluating the relationship between the
   nanostructures and the device performance, we intend to provide general
   guidelines for the design of advanced graphene-based materials with
   structure-to-property tailored toward specific requirements for targeted
   energy applications. Lastly, the potential issues and the perspective
   for future research in graphene-based materials for energy applications
   are also presented. By summarizing the current state-of-the-art as well
   as the exciting achievements from laboratory research, this Review aims
   to demonstrate that real industrial applications of graphene-based
   materials are to be expected in the near future. (1346 references). (C)

Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has emerged as a new and
   effective mechanical energy harvesting technology. In this work, a
   theoretical model for a rotary-sliding disk TENG with grating structure
   was constructed, including the dielectric-to-dielectric and
   conductor-to-dielectric cases. The finite element method (FEM) was
   utilized to characterize the fundamental physics of the rotarysliding
   disk TENG working in both contact and non-contact modes. The basic
   properties of disk TENG were found to be controlled by the structural
   parameters such as tribo-surface spacing, grating number, and geometric
   size. From the FEM calculations, an approximate V-Q-alpha relationship
   was built through the interpolation method, and then the TENG dynamic
   output characteristics with arbitrary load resistance were numerically
   calculated. Finally, the dependencies of output power and matched
   resistance on the structural parameters and rotation rate were revealed.
   The present work provides an in-depth understanding of the working
   principle of the rotary-sliding disk TENG and serves as important
   guidance for optimizing TENG output performance in specific
   applications.}},

   topics are changing all the time, and their induced accumulative
   innovation, or even disruptive revolution, will heavily influence the

   associated terms and phrases to constitute meaningful technological
   topics and their interactions, and (2) identify changing topical
   emphases. Our results are carried forward to present mechanisms that
   forecast prospective developments using Technology Roadmapping,
   combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. An empirical case
   study of Awards data from the United States National Science Foundation,
   Division of Computer and Communication Foundation, is performed to
   demonstrate the proposed method. The resulting knowledge may hold

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{241}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{755-765}},

Abstract = {{Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) have a high incidence of strokes,
   and transcranial Doppler (TCD) identifies at-risk patients by measuring
   blood velocities in large intracerebral arteries; time-averaged mean
   velocities greater than 200 cm/s confer high stroke risk and warrant
   therapeutic intervention with blood transfusions. Our objective was to
   use computational fluid dynamics to alter fluid and artery wall
   properties, to simulate scenarios causative of significantly elevated
   arterial blood velocities. Two-dimensional simulations were created and
   increasing percent stenoses were created in silico, with their locations
   varied among middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal carotid artery
   (ICA), and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Stenoses placed in the MCA,
   ICA, or ACA generated local increases in velocity, but not sufficient to
   reach magnitudes > 200 cm/s, even up to 75\% stenosis. Three-dimensional
   reconstructions of the MCA, ICA, and ACA from children with SCA were
   generated from magnetic resonance angiograms. Using finite element
   method, blood flow was simulated with realistic velocity waveforms to
   the ICA inlet. Three-dimensional reconstructions revealed an uneven,
   internal arterial wall surface in children with SCA and higher mean
   velocities in the MCA up to 145 cm/s compared to non-SCA
   reconstructions. There were also greater areas of flow recirculation and
   larger regions of low wall shear stress. Taken together, these bumps on
   the internal wall of the cerebral arteries could create local flow
   disturbances that, in aggregate, could elevate blood velocities in SCA.
   Identifying cellular causes of these microstructures as adhered blood
   cells or luminal narrowing due to endothelial hyperplasia induced by
   disturbed flow would provide new targets to treat children with SCA. The
   preliminary qualitative results provided here point out the critical
   role of 3D reconstruction of patient-specific vascular geometries and
   provide qualitative insight to complex interplay between vascular
   geometry and rheological properties possibly altered by SCA.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed a non-Newtonian fluid model containing two

   of finite chain dynamics. The resulting model shows excellent fitting to
   experimental results with fewer model parameters than the previous

Abstract = {{The lamina cribrosa (LC) is a complex mesh-like tissue in the posterior
   eye. Its biomechanical environment is thought to play a major role in
   glaucoma, the second most common cause of blindness. Due to its small
   size and relative inaccessibility, high-resolution measurements of LC
   deformation, important in characterizing LC biomechanics, are
   challenging. Here we present a novel noninvasive imaging method, which
   enables measurement of the three-dimensional deformation of the LC
   caused by acute elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Posterior
   segments of porcine eyes were imaged using synchrotron radiation phase
   contrast micro-computed tomography (PC mu CT) at IOPs between 6 and 37
   mmHg. The complex trabecular architecture of the LC was reconstructed
   with an isotropic spatial resolution of 3.2 mu m. Scans acquired at
   different IOPs were analyzed with digital volume correlation (DVC) to
   compute full-field deformation within the LC. IOP elevation caused
   substantial tensile, shearing and compressive devformation within the
   LC, with maximum tensile strains at 30 mmHg averaging 5.5\%, and
   compressive strains reaching 20\%. We conclude that PC mu CT provides a
   novel high-resolution method for imaging the LC, and when combined with
   DVC, allows for full-field 3D measurement of ex vivo LC biomechanics at
   high spatial resolution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, surface roughness models for a substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) are proposed. Frequency-dependent conductivity is
   introduced to model the conductor loss due to surface roughness. To be
   specific, two models, namely, the modified Huray model and the rigorous
   waveguide model, are developed. Both models take into account the
   mode-dependent loss. Formulations for enhancement factor are derived for
   both models to calculate the frequency-dependent conductivity. Key
   parameters of the analytical models are extracted from the surface
   profile measurement. A D-band (110-170 GHz) SIW structure is fabricated
   using a liquid crystal polymer substrate. The simulated results are
   correlated with measured data of the fabricated SIW, which shows the
   accuracy of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze packet-based energy efficiencies (EE) of
   battery-powered multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mobile radio
   communications over frequency-selective fading channels in the presence
   of cochannel interference (CCI). An efficient interference avoidance
   (IA) technique is proposed that relies on the conveyance of interference
   statistics derived at the receiver. Using the IA information, which
   incurs very small overhead, the transmitter selects the subchannels to
   be used for communications and on these subchannels, channel state
   information (CSI) derived from time-division duplexing (TDD) operation
   is applied in linear precoding strategies to minimize transmit energy
   consumption. The minimum energy solution is conditioned on various
   factors such as channel coding characteristics, linear precoding beams,
   interference avoidance schemes, and channel realizations. A method for
   identifying the transmit power leading to optimization is derived and
   simulation results show the effectiveness of the techniques over MIMO
   fading channels with different CCI conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant off-chip interconnects as the first-level and second-level
   compliant interconnect structures are able to accommodate the
   differential displacement between the die and the substrate or between
   the substrate and the board due to their high in-plane and out-of-plane
   compliance. This paper presents experimental and simulation results of
   drop testing of silicon substrates with micro-scale copper compliant
   interconnects assembled on organic boards. The micro-scale copper
   compliant interconnects in this paper are three-arc-fan compliant
   interconnects with arcuate beam width equal to 10, 15, and 20 mu m,
   respectively. The samples with three-arc-fan compliant interconnects
   were subjected to drop tests at varying drop heights ranging from 20 to
   50 cm in steps of 10 cm. The experimental and simulation results were
   compared against the corresponding results obtained from the samples
   assembled with the solder ball interconnects. Through drop-test
   experiments and simulations, it is shown that the three-arc-fan
   compliant interconnects when scaled down in size and fabricated through
   copper electroplating process are able to isolate the strain transferred
   from an organic board to a silicon substrate, and that the impact
   isolation increases with the increased compliance of the interconnects.

Abstract = {{Nanotwins require little energy to form in metals, but their impact on
   strength and ductility is dramatic. New mechanisms of strengthening,
   strain hardening, ductility, and strainrate sensitivity have been
   observed in nanowires, films, and bulk materials containing nanoscale
   twins as the twin-boundary spacing decreases. These mechanisms can act
   in concert to produce interface-dominated nanomaterials with extreme
   tensile strength and plastic deformation without breaking. This article
   reviews recent theoretical and experimental understanding of the
   physical mechanisms of plasticity in nanotwin-strengthened metals, with
   a particular focus on the fundamental roles of coherent, incoherent, and
   defective twin boundaries in plastic deformation of bulk and small-scale
   cubic systems, and discusses new experimental methods for controlling
   these deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metals and alloys.}},

Abstract = {{The US Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) has emphasized the need to
   accelerate the discovery and development of materials to maintain
   industry competitiveness in new and existing markets. While largely
   interpreted as an initiative arising from the materials community, it is
   important to address the coupling of materials with manufacturing and
   all other relevant aspects of product development in order to maximize
   its impact. The dual thrusts of Integrated Computational Materials
   Engineering and the MGI represent a long-term vision of industry,
   academic, and government stakeholders. The goal is to build a new kind
   of coupled experimental, computational, and data sciences
   infrastructure. The emphasis is on high-throughput methods to accelerate
   historical sequential processes of serendipitous materials discovery and
   largely empirical materials development by leveraging computation and
   modern data sciences and analytics. The notion of a materials innovation
   ecosystem is introduced as the framework in which to pursue acceleration
   of discovery and development of materials consisting of various elements
   of data sciences, design optimization, manufacturing scale-up and

Abstract = {{Plant viruses have been highlighted among material research due to their
   well-defined structures in nanoscale, monodispersity, stability, and

   a viral nanoparticle can be homogeneously modified, chemically and
   genetically, with a functional ligand leading to a high-density and
   spatial distribution of ligands on each particle (multi valency).
   Previous reports from our group have evidenced that substrates coated
   with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its mutant promote early
   osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We then fabricated a
   three-dimensional (3D) biopolymeric scaffold with rod-like TMV in the
   form of a The virus-sponge-like hydrogel for tissue engineering
   purposes. The hydrogel was functionalized arginine glycine aspartic acid
   (RGD), through an incorporation of an RGD mutant of functionalized
   hydrogel materials were shown to aid bone differentiation of MSCs in
   vitro. Herein, we performed an in vivo study based on the TMV and
   TMV-RGD hydrogels in Sprague Dawley rats with cranial bone defects. This
   report substantiated the hypothesis that TMV-functionalized hydrogel
   scaffolds did not cause systemic toxicity when implanted in the defect
   site and that the TMV-based hydrogel platform can support cell
   localization and can be further optimized for bone regeneration and
   repair. with the cellular recognition peptide, TMV (TMV-RGD).}},

Abstract = {{In order to minimize the amount of energy consumption at the user
   equipment (UE) level, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
   presented in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) an approach called
   discontinuous reception (DRX). Nevertheless, existing models for the LTE
   DRX and their extension to scenarios that support carrier aggregation
   (CA) and multi-stream carrier aggregation (MSCA) have several drawbacks.
   In this paper, we utilize a semi-Markov Chain to model the operation of
   the LTE DRX and characterize its performance metrics. Then, we exploit
   the new features introduced in LTE Advanced (LTE-A) to develop a novel
   cross-carrier-aware DRX for scenarios that support CA and MSCA since the
   energy consumption in such scenarios can be significantly higher and
   existing techniques simply reapplied the traditional DRX scheme. We
   present a detailed examination of our DRX solution along with the
   analytical expressions of its performance metrics. The accuracy of
   ourmodeling approach for both the classical and our novel LTE DRX is
   validated through extensive simulations across a wide range of
   parameters. We evaluate the performance of our cross-carrier-aware DRX
   solution and show that it can significantly outperform the classical
   one, especially under a low tolerable delay. In addition, we also show
   the effects of implementation-dependent power levels on the performance
   of our cross-carrier aware DRX. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Materials with a large nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) and relatively
   small linear and nonlinear absorption losses, namely, two-photon
   absorption (2PA, of coefficient alpha(2)), have long been sought after
   for applications such as alloptical switching (AOS). Here we
   experimentally determine the linear and 2PA properties of several
   organic molecules, which we approximate as centrosymmetric, and use a
   simplified essential-state model (quasi-three-level model) to predict
   the dispersion of n(2). We then compare these predictions with
   experimental measurements of n(2) and find good agreement. Here
   ``quasi{''}-three-level means using a single one-photon allowed
   intermediate state and multiple (here two) two-photon allowed states.
   This also allows predictions of the figure-of-merit (FOM), defined as
   the ratio of nonlinear refractive phase shift to the 2PA fractional
   loss, that determines the viability for such molecules to be used in
   device applications. The model predicts that the optimized wavelength
   range for a large FOM lies near the short wavelength linear absorption
   edge for cyanine-like dyes where the magnitude of n2 is quite large.
   However, 2PA bands lying close to the linear absorption edge in certain
   classes of molecules can greatly reduce this FOM. We identify two
   molecules having a large FOM for AOS. We note that the FOM is often
   defined as the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the third-order
   susceptibility (chi((3))) with multiple processes leading to both
   components. As explained later in this paper, such definitions require
   care to only include the 2PA contribution to the imaginary part of
   chi((3)) in regions of transparency. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Efficient Implementation of Collective Extended Producer Responsibility

Abstract = {{Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool that holds
   producers financially responsible for the post-use collection,
   recycling, and disposal of their products. Many EPR implementations are
   collective-a large collection and recycling network (CRN) handles
   multiple producers' products in order to benefit from scale and scope
   economies. The total cost is then allocated to producers based on
   metrics such as their return shares by weight. Such weight-based
   proportional allocation mechanisms are criticized in practice for not
   taking into account the heterogeneity in the costs imposed by different
   producers' products. The consequence is cost allocations that impose
   higher costs on certain producer groups than they can achieve
   independently. This may lead some producers to break away from
   collective systems, resulting in fragmented systems with higher total
   cost. Yet cost efficiency is a key legislative and producer concern. To
   address this concern, this paper develops cost allocation mechanisms
   that induce participation in collective systems and maximize cost
   efficiency. The cost allocation mechanisms we propose consist of
   adjustments to the widely used return share method and include the
   weighing of return shares based on processing costs and the rewarding of
   capacity contributions to collective systems. We validate our
   theoretical results using Washington state EPR implementation data and
   provide insights into how these mechanisms can be implemented in
   practice.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Surface immobilization of bioactive molecules is a central paradigm in
   the design of implantable devices and biosensors with improved clinical
   performance capabilities. However, in vivo degradation or denaturation
   of surface constituents often limits the long-term performance of
   bioactive films. Here we demonstrate the capacity to repeatedly
   regenerate a covalently immobilized monomolecular thin film of bioactive
   molecules through a two-step stripping and recharging cycle. Reversible
   transpeptidation by a laboratory evolved Staphylococcus aureus sortase A
   (eSrtA) enabled the rapid immobilization of an anti-thrombogenic film in
   the presence of whole blood and permitted multiple cycles of film
   regeneration in vitro that preserved its biological activity. Moreover,
   eSrtA transpeptidation facilitated surface re-engineering of medical
   devices in situ after in vivo implantation through removal and
   restoration film constituents. These studies establish a rapid,
   orthogonal and reversible biochemical scheme to regenerate selective
   molecular constituents with the potential to extend the lifetime of
   bioactive films.}},

Abstract = {{Benchmarking is a community-based and (preferably) community-driven
   activity involving consensus based decisions on how to make

   benchmarking presents unique opportunities to advance and accelerate
   understanding of complex reaction systems by combining and comparing
   experimental information from multiple, in situ and operando techniques
   with theoretical insights derived from calculations characterizing model
   systems. This Perspective describes the origins and uses of benchmarking
   and its applications in computational catalysis, heterogeneous
   catalysis, molecular catalysis, and electrocatalysis. It also discusses

Title = {{Effect of microstructure on oxygen rich layer evolution and its impact

   titanium}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The near alpha titanium alloy, Ti-6424S, is utilized in many critical
   high-temperature aerospace components due to its unique properties.
   However, oxygen ingress during elevated-temperature exposure induces
   formation of a subsurface brittle oxygen-rich layer (ORL), resulting in
   a deterioration of mechanical performance. This paper, for the first
   time, establishes the effect of the underlying microstructure on the
   formation and evolution of the ORL in 413 titanium alloys. In addition,
   models were developed to predict (i) the evolution of ORL as a function
   of the material microstructure, (ii) the effect of ORL on the critical
   strain for in-service crack initiation, and (iii) estimates of fatigue
   life of components made from a specific microstructure during in-service
   high temperature exposure and formation of ORL. In particular, five
   different microstructures were produced by tailored heat-treatments and
   thermally exposed at 650 degrees C up to 420 h. The base metal and the
   ORL were quantified using microhardness indentations, optical
   microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD), backscattered electron (BSE), and secondary electron
   (SE) imaging). The effective diffusion coefficients (Deg) for each
   microstructure were calculated and then integrated into a critical
   strain model to predict crack initiation strain as a function of
   exposure time. The predicted ORL thickness was used to estimate fatigue
   life using experimentally measured crack growth data. The largest Deg
   coefficient was observed in a colony microstructure, while a basketweave
   microstructure showed the smallest Deft. For several bimodal
   microstructures, Deg was noted to increase with increasing area fraction
   of secondary alpha colonies. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Failure of metals II: Fatigue}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{484-507}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this interpretive review, fatigue in metallic systems is considered
   primarily from the perspective of interactions between the
   microstructure, the deformation mode and the mechanical state at both
   low and high temperatures. In Part 1 the development and early
   propagation of cracks is considered in terms of the basic damage
   mechanisms and the relative size of the crack with respect to applicable
   micro structural feature(s). In this section, a multistage grain scale
   approach to microstructure-sensitive fatigue crack formation and growth
   is presented which uses Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIPs) to correlate
   these processes. Various FIPs parameters are discussed in terms of their
   indication of the state of fatigue. The development and early crack
   propagation is considered in the context of microstructure and notches,
   and probabilistic aspects of the notch fatigue problem are discussed.
   These features are integrated into a systematic approach for the
   selection of fatigue resistant microstructures for given applications.
   In Part 2, attention is focused on Ni-base superalloys and the
   interaction between oxidation, creep and microstructure (including
   coatings) in the formation and propagation of cracks. This part of the
   overview addresses both experimental and modelling aspects.
   Methodologies based upon fundamental physical processes are presented
   for understanding and predicting the development and propagation of
   fatigue cracks, including effects of sequential oxide type formation and
   of creep on either restraining or accelerating damage by oxidation. The
   variable fatigue resistance of discs in jet engines is seen to depend
   upon the variability of microstructure and its influence on the severity
   of creep oxidation interactions. All of these factors are considered in
   the practical case where both temperature and loading parameters vary
   simultaneously (thermomechanical fatigue). A physics-based life
   prediction model considering the interactions of deformation and
   environmental damage is reviewed in terms of its applicability to life
   prediction of components. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Numerical models of native heart valves are being used to study valve
   biomechanics to aid design and development of repair procedures and
   replacement devices. These models have evolved from simple
   two-dimensional approximations to complex three-dimensional, fully
   coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems. Such simulations are
   useful for predicting the mechanical and hemodynamic loading on
   implanted valve devices. A current challenge for improving the accuracy
   of these predictions is choosing and implementing modeling boundary
   conditions. In order to address this challenge, we are utilizing an
   advanced in vitro system to validate FSI conditions for the mitral valve
   system. Explanted ovine mitral valves were mounted in an in vitro setup,
   and structural data for the mitral valve was acquired with CT.
   Experimental data from the in vitro ovine mitral valve system were used
   to validate the computational model. As the valve closes, the
   hemodynamic data, high speed leaflet dynamics, and force vectors from
   the in vitro system were compared to the results of the FSI simulation
   computational model. The total force of 2.6 N per papillary muscle is
   matched by the computational model. In vitro and in vivo force
   measurements enable validating and adjusting material parameters to

   grating profile, large refractive-index differences, and a limited
   grating length. The method is easy to implement and computationally
   efficient and can provide optimal designs based on the system designer's

   compared to those obtained using the finite-difference time-domain
   method, and an excellent agreement is found. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The effect of the compounding method and of the nanofiller geometry on
   the thermo-mechanical properties and electrical behavior of polylactic
   acid (PLA) nanocomposite films was investigated. The films were
   fabricated using two methods: (i) melt compounding followed by melt
   fiber spinning or (ii) solution compounding followed by electrospinning.
   Both the melt and electrospun fibers were then compression molded. In
   the case of melt compounding, both exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets
   (GNP) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) were used as reinforcement, whereas
   only CNT were used in the case of solution compounding. The
   microstructure was examined using scanning electron microscopy and the
   crystallization behavior, thermo-mechanical behavior, and electrical
   response of the PLA composite films were investigated as a function of
   nanofiller content, geometry, and compounding method. It was concluded
   that the GNP/PLA films had the highest percolation at greater than 3
   wt\% of GNP, while the CNT/PLA films had the lowest at less than 1 wt\%
   of CNT. In addition, the solution method and electrospun fibers resulted
   in a higher conductance compared to the CNT/PLA films of the same CNT
   content made by melt compounding due to a more heterogeneous
   distribution and dispersion of CNT throughout the matrix that
   facilitated the formation of interconnected conductive networks. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{The control of flexible systems has been an active area of research for
   many years because of its importance to a wide range of applications.
   The majority of previous research on time-optimal control has
   concentrated on the rest-to-rest problem. However, there are many cases
   when flexible systems are not at rest or are subjected to disturbances.
   This paper presents an approach to design optimal vibration-reducing
   commands for systems with nonzero initial conditions. The problem is
   first formulated as an optimal control problem, and the optimal solution
   is shown to be bang-bang. Once the structure of the optimal command is
   known, a parametric problem formulation is presented for the computation
   of the switching times. Solutions are experimentally verified using a
   portable bridge crane by moving the payload through a commanded motion
   while removing initial payload swing.}},

Abstract = {{The outcomes of flexor tendon repair are highly variable. As recent
   efforts to improve healing have demonstrated promise for growth factor-
   and cell-based therapies, the objective of the current study was to
   enhance repair via application of autologous adipose derived stromal
   cells (ASCs) and the tenogenic growth factor bone morphogenetic protein
   (BMP) 12. Controlled delivery of cells and growth factor was achieved in
   a clinically relevant canine model using a nanofiber/fibrin-based
   scaffold. Control groups consisted of repair-only (no scaffold) and
   acellular scaffold. Repairs were evaluated after 28 days of healing
   using biomechanical, biochemical, and proteomics analyses. Range of
   motion was reduced in the groups that received scaffolds compared to
   normal. There was no effect of ASC+BMP12 treatment for range of motion
   or tensile properties outcomes versus repair-only. Biochemical assays
   demonstrated increased DNA, glycosaminoglycans, and crosslink
   concentration in all repair groups compared to normal, but no effect of
   ASC+BMP12. Total collagen was significantly decreased in the acellular
   scaffold group compared to normal and significantly increased in the
   ASC+BMP12 group compared to the acellular scaffold group. Proteomics
   analysis comparing healing tendons to uninjured tendons revealed
   significant increases in proteins associated with inflammation, stress
   response, and matrix degradation. Treatment with ASC+BMP12 amplified
   these unfavorable changes. In summary, the treatment approach used in
   this study induced a negative inflammatory reaction at the repair site
   leading to poor healing. Future approaches should consider cell and
   growth factor delivery methods that do not incite negative local
   reactions. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Title = {{Imaging viral RNA using multiply labeled tetravalent RNA imaging probes
   in live cells}},
Journal = {{METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{91-98}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Viruses represent an important class of pathogens that have had an
   enormous impact on the health of the human race. They are
   extraordinarily diverse; viral particles can range in size from similar
   to 80 nm to similar to 10 pm in length, and contain genomes with RNA or
   DNA strands. Regardless of their genome type, RNA species are frequently
   generated as a part of their replication process, and for viruses with
   RNA genomes, their loading into the virion represents a critical step in
   the creation of infectious particles. RNA imaging tools represent a
   powerful approach to gain insight into fundamental viral processes,
   including virus entry, replication, and virion assembly. Imaging viral
   processes in live cells is critical due to both the heterogeneity of
   these processes on a per cell basis, and the inherent dynamics of these
   processes. There are a number of methods for labeling RNA in live cells;
   we'll introduce the myriad of methods and then focus on one approach for
   labeling viral RNA, using multiply-labeled tetravalent RNA imaging
   probes (MTRIPs), which do not require engineering of the target RNAs. We
   feel this approach is advantageous given many viral genomes may not
   tolerate large nucleotide insertions into their sequences. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Particle acidity affects aerosol concentrations, chemical composition
   and toxicity. Sulfate is often the main acid component of aerosols, and
   largely determines the acidity of fine particles under 2.5 mu m in
   diameter, PM2.5. Over the past 15 years, atmospheric sulfate
   concentrations in the southeastern United States have decreased by 70\%,
   whereas ammonia concentrations have been steady. Similar trends are
   occurring in many regions globally. Aerosol ammonium nitrate
   concentrations were assumed to increase to compensate for decreasing
   sulfate, which would result from increasing neutrality. Here we use
   observed gas and aerosol composition, humidity, and temperature data
   collected at a rural southeastern US site in June and July 2013 (ref.
   1), and a thermodynamic model that predicts pH and the gas-particle
   equilibrium concentrations of inorganic species from the observations to
   show that PM2.5 at the site is acidic. pH buffering by partitioning of
   ammonia between the gas and particle phases produced a relatively
   constant particle pH of 0-2 throughout the 15 years of decreasing
   atmospheric sulfate concentrations, and little change in particle
   ammonium nitrate concentrations. We conclude that the reductions in
   aerosol acidity widely anticipated from sulfur reductions, and expected
   acidity-related health and climate benefits, are unlikely to occur until
   atmospheric sulfate concentrations reach near pre-anthropogenic levels.}},

Title = {{Effect of Angiotensin II Type I Receptor Blockade with Valsartan on
   Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis: A Double Blind Randomized Clinical Trial

Abstract = {{Background Progression of atherosclerosis is associated with a greater
   risk for adverse outcomes. Angiotensin II plays a key role in the
   pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis. We aimed to investigate
   the effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockade with Valsartan on
   carotid wall atherosclerosis, with the hypothesis that Valsartan will
   reduce progression of atherosclerosis.
   Methods Subjects (n = 120) with carotid intima-media thickness N0.65 mm
   by ultrasound were randomized (2: 1) in a double-blind manner to receive
   either Valsartan or placebo for 2 years. Bilateral T2-weighted
   black-blood carotid magnetic resonance imaging was performed at
   baseline, 12 and 24 months. Changes in the carotid bulb vessel wall area
   and wall thickness were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included
   changes in carotid plaque thickness, plasma levels of aminothiols,
   C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and endothelium-dependent and
   -independent vascular function.
   Results Over 2 years, the carotid bulb vessel wall area decreased with
   Valsartan (-6.7, 95\% CI {[}-11.6, -1.9] mm(2)) but not with placebo
   (3.4, 95\% CI {[}-2.8, 9.6] mm(2)), P =.01 between groups. Similarly,
   mean wall thickness decreased with Valsartan (-0.18, 95\% CI {[}-0.30,
   -0.06] mm), but not with placebo (0.08, 95\% CI {[}-0.07, 0.23] mm), P =
   .009 between groups. Furthermore, plaque thickness decreased with
   Valsartan (-0.35, 95\% CI {[}-0.63, -0.08] mm) but was unchanged with
   placebo (+0.28, 95\% CI {[}-0.11, 0.69] mm), P =.01 between groups.
   These findings were unaffected by statin therapy or changes in blood
   pressure. Notably, there were significant improvements in the aminothiol
   cysteineglutathione disulfide, and trends to improvements in fibrinogen
   levels and endothelium-independent vascular function.
   Conclusions In subjects with carotid wall thickening, angiotensin II
   type-1 receptor blockade was associated with regression in carotid
   atherosclerosis. Whether these effects translate into improved outcomes
   in subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis warrants investigation.}},

Title = {{Rationale and methodology of a collaborative learning project in
   congenital cardiac care}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{129-137}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Collaborative learning is a technique through which
   individuals or teams learn together by capitalizing on one another's
   knowledge, skills, resources, experience, and ideas. Clinicians
   providing congenital cardiac care may benefit from collaborative
   learning given the complexity of the patient population and team
   approach to patient care.
   Rationale and development Industrial system engineers first performed
   broad-based time-motion and process analyses of congenital cardiac care
   programs at 5 Pediatric Heart Network core centers. Rotating
   multidisciplinary team site visits to each center were completed to
   facilitate deep learning and information exchange. Through monthly
   conference calls and an in-person meeting, we determined that duration
   of mechanical ventilation following infant cardiac surgery was one key
   variation that could impact a number of clinical outcomes. This was
   underscored by one participating center's practice of early extubation
   in the majority of its patients. A consensus clinical practice guideline
   using collaborative learning was developed and implemented by
   multidisciplinary teams from the same 5 centers. The 1-year prospective
   initiative was completed in May 2015, and data analysis is under way.
   Conclusion Collaborative learning that uses multidisciplinary team site
   visits and information sharing allows for rapid structured fact-finding
   and dissemination of expertise among institutions. System modeling and
   machine learning approaches objectively identify and prioritize focused
   areas for guideline development. The collaborative learning framework
   can potentially be applied to other components of congenital cardiac
   care and provide a complement to randomized clinical trials as a method
   to rapidly inform and improve the care of children with congenital heart
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Current approaches to treat osteoarthritis (OA) are insufficient.
   Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been used for the past
   decade to treat patients with OA or focal cartilage defects. However, a
   number of complications have been reported post-ACI, including
   athrofibrosis and symptomatic hypertrophy. Thus, a long-term ACI
   strategy should ideally incorporate methods to `prime' autologous
   chondrocytes to form a cartilage-specific matrix and suppress
   hypertrophic mineralization. The objective of this study is to examine
   the effects of tyrosine-rich amelogenin peptide (TRAP; an isoform of the
   developmental protein amelogenin) on human articular cartilage cell
   (HAC) chondrogenic differentiation and hypertrophic mineralization in
   vitro. Effects of chemically synthesized TRAP on HAC chondrogenic
   differentiation were determined by assessing: (1) sGAG production; (2)
   Alcian blue staining for proteoglycans; (3) collagen type II
   immunostaining; and (4) expression of the chondrogenic genes SOX9, ACAN
   and COL2A1. Hypertrophic mineralization was assayed by: (1) ALP
   expression; (2) Alizarin red staining for Ca+2-rich bone nodules; (3) OC
   immunostaining; and (4) expression of the osteogenic/hypertrophic genes
   Ihh and BSP. Chemically synthesized TRAP was found to suppress terminal
   osteogenic differentiation of HACs cultured in hypertrophic
   mineralization-like conditions, an effect mediated via down-regulation
   of the Ihh gene. Moreover, TRAP was found to augment chondrogenic
   differentiation of HACs via induction of SOX9 gene expression when cells
   were cultured in pro-chondrogenic media. The results obtained from this
   proof-of-concept study motivate further studies on the use of TRAP as
   part of a preconditioning regimen in autologous chondrocyte implantation
   procedures for OA patients and patients suffering from focal cartilage
   defects.}},

Journal = {{CELLULOSE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1401-1413}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The effect of alkyl chain length on the wetting properties of
   alkyltrichlorosilane coated cellulose-based paper is reported for four
   different reagents: methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS; -CH3),
   butyltrichlorosilane (BTCS; -C4H9), dodecyltrichlorosilane (DTCS;
   -C12H25) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTCS; -C18H37). SEM analysis
   reveals that by systematically varying alkyl chain length, films with
   different surface morphologies can be generated on flat silicon wafer
   control samples and on cellulose-based paper samples. The variation in
   surface morphology leads to different wetting behavior, as determined by
   measuring static water and oil contact angles. Due to the nano- and
   micron- scale roughness on MTCS coated substrates, paper samples coated
   with MTCS display superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of
   152.2A degrees, which is the highest water contact angle among these
   four alkyltrichlorosilanes. However, additional nano-scale roughness
   from MTCS coating reduces the oil resistance of coated paper samples,
   while paper samples coated with long-chain alkyltrichlorosilanes have
   lower surface energy and also lack nano-scale roughness. As a result,
   paper samples coated with OTCS display the highest resistance against
   oils (ethylene glycol contact angle 125.5A degrees; diiodomethane
   contact angle 101.3A degrees). The intrinsic porosity of paper is
   largely retained after coating, as indicated by the fact that low
   surface tension fluids like methanol can easily penetrate coated paper
   samples.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Due to the rapidly decreasing costs of small renewable electricity
   generation `systems, centralized power systems are no longer a necessary
   condition of universal access to modern energy services. Developing
   countries, where centralized electricity infrastructures are less
   developed, may be able to adopt these new technologies more quickly. We
   first review the costs of grid extension and distributed solar home
   systems (SHSs) as reported by a number of different studies. We then
   present a general analytic framework for analyzing the choice between
   extending the grid and implementing distributed solar home systems.
   Drawing upon reported grid expansion cost data for three specific
   regions, we demonstrate this framework by determining the electricity
   consumption levels at which the costs of provision through centralized
   and decentralized approaches are equivalent in these regions. We then
   calculate SHS capital costs that are necessary for these technologies
   provide each of five tiers of energy access, as defined by the United
   Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Our results suggest that
   solar home systems can play an important role in achieving universal
   access to basic energy services. The extent of this role depends on
   three primary factors: SHS costs, grid expansion costs, and centralized
   generation costs. Given current technology costs, centralized systems
   will still be required to enable higher levels of consumption; however,
   cost reduction trends have the potential to disrupt this paradigm. By
   looking ahead rather than replicating older infrastructure styles,
   developing countries can leapfrog to a more distributed electricity
   service model. (C) 2016 International Energy Initiative. Published by

Abstract = {{Finite-time stability involves dynamical systems whose trajectories
   converge to an equilibrium state in finite time. Since finite-time
   convergence implies nonuniqueness of system solutions in reverse time,
   such systems possess non-Lipschitzian dynamics. Sufficient conditions
   for finite-time stability have been developed in the literature using
   continuous Lyapunov functions. In this technical note, we develop a
   framework for addressing the problem of optimal nonlinear analysis and
   feedback control for finite-time stability and finite-time
   stabilization. Finite-time stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system
   is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov function that satisfies a
   differential inequality involving fractional powers. This Lyapunov
   function can clearly be seen to be the solution to a partial
   differential equation that corresponds to a steady-state form of the
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and hence, guaranteeing both
   finite-time stability and optimality.}},

Abstract = {{Theidentification of the exact positions of the first and second heart
   sounds within a phonocardiogram (PCG), or heart sound segmentation, is
   an essential step in the automatic analysis of heart sound recordings,
   allowing for the classification of pathological events. While
   threshold-based segmentation methods have shown modest success,
   probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models, have recently been
   shown to surpass the capabilities of previous methods. Segmentation
   performance is further improved when a priori information about the
   expected duration of the states is incorporated into the model, such as
   in a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). This paper addresses the problem
   of the accurate segmentation of the first and second heart sound within
   noisy real-world PCG recordings using an HSMM, extended with the use of
   logistic regression for emission probability estimation. In addition, we
   implement a modified Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most likely
   sequence of states, and evaluated this method on a large dataset of 10
   172 s of PCG recorded from 112 patients (including 12 181 first and 11
   627 second heart sounds). The proposed method achieved an average F-1
   score of 95.63 +/- 0.85\%, while the current state of the art achieved
   86.28 +/- 1.55\% when evaluated on unseen test recordings. The greater
   discrimination between states afforded using logistic regression as
   opposed to the previous Gaussian distribution-based emission probability
   estimation as well as the use of an extended Viterbi algorithm allows
   this method to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art
   method based on a two-sided paired t-test.}},

Abstract = {{Several convex formulation methods have been proposed previously for
   statistical estimation with structured sparsity as the prior. These
   methods often require a carefully tuned regularization parameter, often
   a cumbersome or heuristic exercise. Furthermore, the estimate that these
   methods produce might not belong to the desired sparsity model, albeit
   accurately approximating the true parameter. Therefore, greedy-type
   algorithms could often be more desirable in estimating structured-sparse
   parameters. So far, these greedy methods have mostly focused on linear
   statistical models. In this paper, we study the projected gradient
   descent with a non-convex structured-sparse parameter model as the
   constraint set. Should the cost function have a stable model-restricted
   Hessian, the algorithm produces an approximation for the desired
   minimizer. As an example, we elaborate on application of the main
   results to estimation in generalized linear models.}},

   using molecular modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Neurotoxic plaques composed of 39 to 42 residue-long amyloid beta
   peptides (A beta s) are copiously present in the brains of patients with
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). Erythrosine B (ER), a xanthene food dye,
   inhibits the formation of A beta fibrils and A beta-associated
   cytotoxicity in vitro. Here, in an attempt to elucidate the inhibition
   mechanism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to
   demonstrate the conformational change of A beta 40 induced by ER
   molecules in atomistic detail. During the simulation, the ER bound to
   the surfaces of both N-terminus and C-terminus regions of A beta 40. Our
   result shows that ER interacts with the aromatic side chains at the
   N-terminus region resulting in destabilization of the inter-chain
   stacking of A beta 40. Moreover, the stablility of the helical
   structures at the residues from 13 to 16 suggests that ER disturbs
   conformational transition of A beta 40. At the C-terminus region, the
   bound ER blocks water molecules and stabilizes the a-helical structure.
   Regardless of the number of ER molecules used, the interruption of the
   formation of the salt-bridge between aspartic acid 23 and lysine 28
   occurred. To further validate our analysis, binding free energies of ER
   at each binding site were evaluated. The finding of stronger binding
   energy at the N-terminus region supports an inhibition mechanism induced
   by stacking interaction between ER and phenylalanine. These findings
   could aid present and future treatment studies for AD by clarifying the
   inhibition mechanism of ER on the conformational transition of A beta 40
   at the molecular level.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-cell patch clamping in vivo is an important neuroscience technique
   that uniquely provides access to both suprathreshold spiking and

   article describes how to set up and use the autopatcher, which is a
   robot for automatically obtaining high-yield and high-quality whole-cell
   patch clamp recordings in vivo. By following this protocol, a functional
   experimental rig for automated whole-cell patch clamping can be set up
   in 1 week. High-quality surgical preparation of mice takes similar to 1
   h, and each autopatching experiment can be carried out over periods
   lasting several hours. Autopatching should enable in vivo intracellular
   investigations to be accessible by a substantial number of neuroscience
   laboratories, and it enables labs that are already doing in vivo patch
   clamping to scale up their efforts by reducing training time for new lab
   members and increasing experimental durations by handling mentally

   hydrogels, which combine the biocompatibility of natural matrices with
   the reproducibility, stability and modularity of synthetic biomaterials.
   We describe here a step-by-step protocol for the preparation of the
   GelMA polymer, which takes 1-2 weeks to complete, and which can be used
   to prepare hydrogel-based 3D cell culture models for cancer and stem
   cell research, as well as for tissue engineering applications. We also
   describe quality control and validation procedures, including how to
   assess the degree of GelMA functionalization and mechanical properties,
   to ensure reproducibility in experimental and animal studies.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates second harmonic generation in Rayleigh
   surface waves propagating in 9\%Cr ferritic martensitic steel. Previous
   experimental results show that nonlinear ultrasound is sensitive to
   certain microstructural changes in materials such as those due to
   thermal embrittlement and precipitation hardening. This research
   measures the ultrasonic nonlinearity parameter as an indicator of
   microstructural changes due to thermal aging in 9\%Cr ferritic
   martensitic steel specimens. The specimens are isothermally aged for
   different holding periods to induce progressive changes in the
   microstructure and to obtain different levels of thermal damage. As
   thermal aging progresses, the existing dislocations are annihilated in
   the beginning and precipitates are formed; these microstructural
   evolutions lead to large changes in the measured nonlinearity parameter,
   beta. Nonlinear ultrasonic experiments are conducted for each specimen
   using a wedge transducer for generation and an air-coupled transducer
   for detection of Rayleigh surface waves. The amplitudes of the first and
   second order harmonics are measured as a function of propagation
   distance, and these amplitudes are used to obtain the relative non
   linearity parameter at different aging stages. A possible scenario for
   the microstructural evolution during thermal aging is proposed based on
   the results from the nonlinear ultrasonic measurements, scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and Rockwell HRC hardness. These results
   indicate a clear trend that the measured nonlinearity parameter is
   sensitive to variations in dislocation and precipitate density, and thus
   can be useful in tracking microstructural changes in this material
   during thermal aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of stochastic responses of a structure caused by
   natural hazards or operations of non-structural components is crucial to
   achieve an effective design. In this regard, it is of great significance
   to incorporate the impact of uncertainty into topology optimization of
   structures under constraints on their stochastic responses. Despite
   recent technological advances, the theoretical framework remains
   inadequate to overcome computational challenges of incorporating
   stochastic responses to topology optimization. Thus, this paper presents
   a theoretical framework that integrates random vibration theories with
   topology optimization using a discrete representation of stochastic
   excitations. This paper also discusses the development of parameter
   sensitivity of dynamic responses in order to enable the use of efficient
   gradient-based optimization algorithms. The proposed topology
   optimization framework and sensitivity method enable efficient topology
   optimization of structures under stochastic excitations, which is
   successfully demonstrated by numerical examples of structures under
   stochastic ground motion excitations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method that takes advantage of real-world
   multiview vision measurements to identify parameters needed in
   physics-based models for creating synthetic perception of a 4-D
   displacement field. To distinguish the 4-D reconstruction from
   traditional graphic reconstructions in 3-D space, ``time{''} plays the
   fourth dimension to provide an essential basis for kinematic or dynamic
   analyses based on physical fields. The coupled real-vision and
   synthetic-perception method is illustrated in the context of a compliant
   multibody mechatronic system where the displacement field of the
   deformable and rigid bodies are reconstructed from a multicamera system.
   The coupled method has been experimentally validated on a test case
   emulating the compliant system negotiating a right-angle corner in tight
   3-D space; perception results of physics-based models closely agree with
   graphical details reconstructed from vision images. The synthetic
   perception results dynamically unveil hidden details, which are
   otherwise obscured in vision images in a virtual environment,
   demonstrating the effectiveness of the coupled method in overcoming
   problems commonly encountered in either vision or physics-based
   modeling.}},

Abstract = {{We present a low power multi-modal patch designed for measuring
   activity, altitude (based on high-resolution barometric pressure), a
   single-lead electrocardiogram, and a tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG).
   Enabled by a novel embedded systems design methodology, this patch
   offers a powerful means of monitoring the physiology for both patients
   with chronic cardiovascular diseases, and the general population
   interested in personal health and fitness measures. Specifically, to the
   best of our knowledge, this patch represents the first demonstration of
   combined activity, environmental context, and hemodynamics monitoring,
   all on the same hardware, capable of operating for longer than 48 hours
   at a time with continuous recording. The three-channels of SCG and
   one-lead ECG are all sampled at 500 Hz with high signal-to-noise ratio,
   the pressure sensor is sampled at 10 Hz, and all signals are stored to a

Abstract = {{Domain wall memory (DWM) is a recently developed spin-based memory
   technology in which several bits of data are densely packed into the
   domains of a ferromagnetic wire. DWM has shown great promise in enabling
   non-volatile memory with very high density and energy efficiency, and
   has been explored for secondary storage and off-chip memory. In this
   work, we explore the use of DWM within the on-chip cache hierarchy of
   general purpose computing platforms. Our work is motivated by the fact
   that DWMs enable much higher density compared to SRAM, DRAM, and other
   spin-based memory technologies such as STT-MRAM. However, DWMs also pose
   the unique challenge of serial access to the bits stored in a cell,
   leading to large and variable access latencies. In addition, DWMs share
   the inherent write inefficiency of other spin-based memories. We propose
   TapeCache, a DWM-based cache design that employs device, circuit, and
   architectural techniques to address these challenges. At the device
   level, we perform write optimization by employing a new write mechanism
   based on domain wall shifts to achieve fast, energy-efficient writes in
   DWM. At the circuit level, we propose different DWM bit-cell designs
   that are tailored to the distinct architectural requirements of
   different levels in the cache hierarchy. At the architecture level, we
   propose a new cache organization and suitable management policies that
   mitigate the performance penalty arising from serial access to bits in a
   DWM cell. We show that the holistic device-circuit-architecture
   co-design enables all the levels in the cache hierarchy to be realized
   using DWM and benefit from its improved density. Over a wide range of
   SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks, TapeCache achieves an average energy
   improvement of 7.5 x with virtually identical performance and 7.8 x
   improvement in area, compared to an iso-capacity SRAM cache. Compared to
   an iso-capacity STT-MRAM cache, TapeCache obtains 3.1 x improvement in
   area and 2 x average energy savings along with 1.1 percent performance
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Existing location management (LM) methods for macrocells in LTE-Advanced
   have tracking area list (TAL) granularity. Therefore, a user equipment
   (UE) triggers a location update (LU) whenever it leaves its current TAL,
   and it is searched through paging (PG) with TAL accuracy. However, these
   procedures are not well-suited for small cells (SCs). The reasons are
   twofold. First, dense deployments of SCs imply that paging has a low
   probability to be successful in the first attempt, increasing the
   signaling overhead in the core network (CN). Second, smaller coverage
   areas lead to a higher mobility among cells, increasing the signaling
   overhead in the CN due to LUs. In this work, two LM schemes with fine
   granularity are proposed. These schemes update UE's location to a local
   anchor (LA) in a SC or tracking area (TA) basis, respectively. By
   increasing the accuracy of UE's location, a significant reduction of
   signaling overhead in the CN due to PG is achieved. Moreover, LUs to the
   LA are performed through direct X2-interface links to avoid signaling
   overhead in the CN. A versatile mobility model is developed and
   closed-form expressions for UEs' mobility metrics are found to validate
   the proposed schemes through variations of critical parameters such as
   TA/TAL configuration, UE's mobility patterns and cell residence times.}},

Abstract = {{Routing is one of the most important and fundamental issues in cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs). However, most of the existing routing algorithms
   for CRNs either cannot fully take account of the spectrum dynamics or
   are resource aided which might introduce too much cost. Therefore, in
   this paper, we study to design an effective routing scheme with respect
   to induced latency and energy consumption for CRNs. Our main
   contributions are threefold. First, we propose a spectrum-aware
   semi-structure routing (SSR) framework which also incorporates power
   control for CRNs. By employing forwarding zones and routing zones, SSR
   can utilize the local real-time spectrum dynamics effectively and
   meanwhile guarantee the global routing performance. In addition, without
   sacrificing spectrum opportunities, SSR achieves energy efficiency by
   completing each data transmission with the lowest allowed working power.
   Second, aiming at closing the gap of lacking of analytical models for
   routing protocol performance {[}4] in CRNs, we propose a mathematical
   framework for SSR which includes a latency analytical model and an
   energy consumption analytical model. Under the dense scaling network
   distribution model, we demonstrate (i) the upper bound of the induced
   latency and scalability of SSR; and (ii) the optimality of SSR with
   respect to energy consumption, which is approximately optimal. Finally,
   extensive simulations are conducted to validate the performance of SSR.
   Simulation results indicate that SSR can utilize spectrum dynamics
   effectively and has better performance than state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Using satellite measurements in microwave bands to retrieve
   precipitation over land requires proper discrimination of the weak
   rainfall signals from strong and highly variable background Earth
   surface emissions. Traditionally, land retrieval methods rely on a weak
   signal of rainfall scattering on high-frequency channels and make use of
   empirical thresholding and regression-based techniques. Because of the
   increased surface signal interference, retrievals over radiometrically
   complex land surfaces-snow-covered lands, deserts, and coastal areas-are
   particularly challenging for this class of retrieval techniques. This
   paper evaluates the results by the recently proposed Shrunken Locally
   Linear Embedding Algorithm for Retrieval of Precipitation (ShARP) using
   data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The
   study focuses on a radiometrically complex region, partly covering the
   Tibetan highlands, Himalayas, and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River
   basins, which is unique in terms of its diverse land surface radiation
   regime and precipitation type, within the TRMM domain. Promising results
   are presented using ShARP over snow-covered land surfaces and in the
   vicinity of coastlines, in comparison with the land rainfall retrievals
   of the standard TRMM 2A12, version 7, product. The results show that
   ShARP can significantly reduce the rainfall overestimation due to the
   background snow contamination and markedly improve detection and
   retrieval of rainfall in the vicinity of coastlines. During the calendar
   year 2013, compared to TRMM 2A25, it is demonstrated that over the study
   domain the root-mean-square difference can be reduced up to 38\%
   annually, while the improvement can reach up to 70\% during the cold
   months of the year.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to evaluate and compare impacts of two alternative
   Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) policies, concentrating growth of
   population or employment opportunities in transit service area, on
   travel demand measures of mode share, trip distance and highway usage. A
   validated Maryland Statewide Transportation Model (MSTM) is employed to
   forecast changes in travel demand measures under various TOD policy
   scenarios in a future year of 2030. The model simulation results show
   either concentrating population or employment policy has similar impacts
   on raising transit mode share and reducing auto mode share. However,
   concentrating population policy decreases average trip distance while
   concentrating employment policy increases it. Consequently,
   concentrating population policy reduces highway usage, measured by
   Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), more effectively than concentrating
   employment policy in this specific region given the existing land use
   pattern. The findings in this paper have important implications to urban
   planners, transportation planners and decision makers in Maryland of US.
   The paper also provides a good example for applying a travel demand
   model to evaluate and compare alternative TOD policies based on travel

Abstract = {{Renyi's parking problem (or 1D sequential interval packing problem)
   dates back to 1958, when Renyi studied the following random process:
   Consider an interval I of length x, and sequentially and randomly pack
   disjoint unit intervals in I until the remaining space prevents placing
   any new segment. The expected value of the measure of the covered part
   of I is M(x), so that the ratio M(x)/x is the expected filling density
   of the random process. Following recent work by Gargano et al. {[}4], we
   studied the discretized version of the above process by considering the
   packing of the 1D discrete lattice interval \{1, 2, ..., n + 2k - 1\}
   with disjoint blocks of (k + 1) integers but, as opposed to the
   mentioned {[}4] result, our exclusion process is symmetric, hence more
   natural. Furthermore, we were able to obtain useful recursion formulas
   for the expected number of r-gaps (0 <= r <= k) between neighboring
   blocks. We also provided very fast converging series and extensive
   computer simulations for these expected numbers, so that the limiting
   filling density of the long line segment (as n -> infinity) is Renyi's
   famous parking constant, 0.7475979203 ....}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a highly effective
   and easily scalable technology for harvesting mechanical energy.
   Recently, standards and figure-of-merits have been defined to quantify
   the performance of TENGs. In this work, the figure-of-merits of
   rolling-friction-based TENGs are investigated through a theoretical
   model based on the rolling freestanding mode, including the
   conductor-to-dielectric and dielectric-to-dielectric cases. By combining
   finite-element simulations and semi-analytical derivations, the basic
   properties and resistive load output characteristics of rolling TENGs
   are calculated for various structural parameters, such as the electrode
   gap or rod diameter. The average output power is optimized by maximizing
   the structural figure-of-merit, which depends on the structural
   parameters. The results gained in this work could provide useful
   guidance for optimizing the performance of rolling-friction-based TENGs
   toward practical self-powered systems.}},

Abstract = {{Robust optimization is an important technique to immunize optimization
   problems against data uncertainty. In the case of a linear program and
   an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, the robust counterpart turns into a

   of linearizing the second-order cone constraints of the latter. This is
   done using the optimal linear outer-approximation approach by Ben-Tal
   and Nemirovski (Math Oper Res 26: 193-205, 2001) from which we derive an
   optimal inner approximation of the second-order cone. We examine the
   performance of this approach on various benchmark sets including
   portfolio optimization instances as well as (robustified versions of)
   the MIPLIB and the SNDlib.}},

Abstract = {{A novel molybdenum modified PbO2 electrode was successfully prepared
   with the method of electrode position. The SEM and XRD were employed to
   study the surface morphology of electrodes, which indicated that the
   modified PbO2 electrode had a larger effective area and more compact
   film. Electrochemical degradation of cinnamic acid (CA) in aqueous
   solution with Mo-PbO2 electrode and PbO2 electrode were investigated.
   The results showed that the Mo-PbO2 electrode had a better effect of CA
   removal. The operational parameters influencing the electrochemical
   degradation of CA with Mo-PbO2 electrode were optimized and the results
   revealed that the electrochemical degradation of CA followed the
   pseudo-first-order kinetics and the optimal removal of CA and COD were
   85.51\% and 25.79\% after 120 min on condition of the electrolyte
   concentration, initial concentration of CA, current density and initial
   value of pH were 0.1 mol/L, 300 mg/L, 10 mA/cm(2) and 3.4, respectively.
   The degradation mechanism of CA in electrochemical oxidation with
   Mo-PbO2 electrode was analyzed and the main degradation pathway of CA
   was proposed based on the intermediates identified by IC and GC-MS. (C)

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Spin polarized density functional theory calculation combined with
   periodic slabs were employed to reveal the elemental mercury (Hg-0)
   adsorption mechanism on Co3O4 (110) surface. The adsorption energies and
   possible adsorption sites were investigated. To understand the
   adsorption interaction more directly, the electronic structural changes
   of before and after adsorption were compared. The hybridization of
   orbitals was studied by the partial density of states (PDOS) analysis.
   In addition, the temperature effects toward equilibrium constants of
   Hg-0-Co3O4 system were taken into consideration. The results manifested
   that the interaction between Hg-0 and Co3O4 (11 0) surface is
   chemisorption with -74.037 klimol. Co3+ sites, the highest oxidation
   state of Co atoms, are crucial in this process which can accept the
   electrons after Hg-0 oxidation. The redundant electrons transfer to 0
   and other Co atoms nearby. PDOS analysis indicates the hybridization of
   s orbitals (Hg-0) and p, d orbitals (Co atom). And d orbitals of Hg-0
   interacts with s, p orbitals of Co atom strongly. The trends of
   equilibrium constants suggest that Hg-0 adsorption on Co3O4 (1 1 0)
   surface is favorable at low temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The problem of evaluating a military or GPS/GSM system's precision
   quality is considered in this article, where one sequentially observes
   bivariate normal data (X-i, Y-i)'s and wants to test hypotheses on the
   circular error probability (CEP) or the probability of nonconforming,
   i.e., the probabilities of the system hitting or missing a pre-specified
   disk target. In such a problem, we first consider a sequential
   probability ratio test (SPRT) developed under the erroneous assumption
   of the correlation coefficient rho = 0, and investigate its properties
   when the true rho not equal 0. It was shown that at least one of the
   Type I and Type II error probabilities would be larger than the required
   ones if the true rho not equal 0, and for the detailed effects,
   exp\{-2\} approximate to 0.1353 turns out to be a critical value for the
   hypothesized probability of nonconforming. Moreover, we propose several
   sequential tests when the correlation coefficient rho is unknown, and
   among these tests, the method of generalized sequential likelihood ratio
   test (GSLRT) in Bangdiwala (1982) seems to work well. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study tested the hypothesis that encapsulation of influenza vaccine
   in microneedle patches increases vaccine stability during storage at
   elevated temperature.
   Whole inactivated influenza virus vaccine (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) was
   formulated into dissolving microneedle patches and vaccine stability was
   evaluated by in vitro and in vivo assays of antigenicity and
   immunogenicity after storage for up to 3 months at 4, 25, 37 and 45A
   degrees C.
   While liquid vaccine completely lost potency as determined by
   hemagglutination (HA) activity within 1-2 weeks outside of
   refrigeration, vaccine in microneedle patches lost 40-50\% HA activity
   during or shortly after fabrication, but then had no significant
   additional loss of activity over 3 months of storage, independent of
   temperature. This level of stability required reduced humidity by
   packaging with desiccant, but was not affected by presence of oxygen.
   This finding was consistent with additional stability assays, including
   antigenicity of the vaccine measured by ELISA, virus particle
   morphological structure captured by transmission electron microscopy and
   protective immune responses by immunization of mice in vivo.
   These data show that inactivated influenza vaccine encapsulated in
   dissolving microneedle patches has enhanced stability during extended
   storage at elevated temperatures.}},

Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Vascularization of bone defects is considered a crucial component to the
   successful regeneration of large bone defects. Although vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been delivered to critical-size
   bone defect models to augment blood vessel infiltration into the defect
   area, its potential to increase bone repair remains ambiguous. In this
   study, we investigated whether integrin-specific biomaterials modulate
   the effects of VEGF on bone regeneration. We engineered
   protease-degradable, VEGF-loaded poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels
   functionalized with either a triple-helical, (21) integrin-specific
   peptide GGYGGGP(GPP)(5)GFOGER(GPP)(5)GPC (GFOGER) or an (v3)
   integrin-targeting peptide GRGDSPC (RGD). Covalent incorporation of VEGF
   into the PEG hydrogel allowed for protease degradation-dependent release
   of the protein while maintaining VEGF bioactivity. When applied to
   critical-size segmental defects in the murine radius,
   GFOGER-functionalized VEGF-free hydrogels exhibited significantly
   increased vascular volume and density and resulted in a larger number of
   thicker blood vessels compared to RGD-functionalized VEGF-free
   hydrogels. VEGF-loaded RGD hydrogels increased vascularization compared
   to VEGF-free RGD hydrogels, but the levels of vascularization for these
   VEGF-containing RGD hydrogels were similar to those of VEGF-free GFOGER
   hydrogels. VEGF transiently increased bone regeneration in RGD hydrogels
   but had no effect at later time points. In GFOGER hydrogels, VEGF did
   not show an effect on bone regeneration. However, VEGF-free GFOGER
   hydrogels resulted in increased bone regeneration compared to VEGF-free
   RGD hydrogels. These findings demonstrate the importance of
   integrin-specificity in engineering constructs for vascularization and
   associated bone regeneration. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Title = {{Semi-Exact Natural Frequencies for Kirchhoff-Love Plates Using

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents semi-exact, closed-form algebraic expressions for
   the natural frequencies of Kirchhoff-Love plates by analyzing plane
   waves, their edge reflections, and their phase closure. The semi-exact
   nature is such that the analysis exactly satisfies plate boundary
   conditions along each edge when taken in isolation, but not fully when
   combined, and thus is approximate near a corner. As frequency increases,
   the expressions become increasingly more accurate. For clamped square
   plates, closed-form expressions are reported in algebraic form for the
   first time. These expressions are developed by tracing the path of plane
   waves as they reflect from edges while accounting for phase changes over
   a total trip. This change includes phase addition/subtraction due to
   edge reflections. A natural frequency is identified as a frequency in
   which three phase changes (in the plate's horizontal, vertical, and path
   directions) each sum to an integer multiple of 2p, enforcing phase
   closure along each direction. A solution of the subsequent equations is
   found in closed form, for multiple boundary conditions, such that highly
   convenient algebraic expressions result for the plate natural
   frequencies. The expressions are exact for the case of all sides simply
   supported, while for other boundary conditions, the expressions are
   semi-exact. For the practically important and difficult case of a fully
   clamped plate, the expressions for a square plate yield the first 20
   nondimensional natural frequencies to within 0.06\% of their exact
   values.}},

Title = {{Rotordynamic Analysis of Rotor-Stator Rub Using Rough Surface Contact}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Undesirable rotor-stator rub is frequently observed in rotordynamic
   systems, and has been the subject of many investigations. Most of these
   studies employ a simple piecewise-smooth linear-elastic contact model
   (LECM), where the rotor switches between noncontacting and contacting
   operation once the clearance is exceeded (various complications have
   been incorporated, though the essential model premises endure). Though
   useful as a first step, the LECM relies on an arcane contact stiffness
   estimate, and therefore does not emulate the actual contacting surfaces.
   Consequentially, the LECM fails to elucidate how real surface parameters
   influence contact severity and surface durability. This work develops a
   novel model for rotor-stator rub which is commensurate with reality by
   treating the surfaces as a collection of stochastically distributed
   asperities. Specifically, the elastoplastic Jackson-Green (JG) rough
   surface contact model is used to calculate the quasistatic contact force
   as a function of rotor displacement, where bulk material deformation and
   surface cumulative damage are ignored. A simple exponential fit of the
   contact force is proposed to reduce computational burden associated with
   evaluating the JG rough surface contact model at each simulation time
   step. The rotor's response using the LECM and JG rough surface contact
   model is compared via shaft speed bifurcations and orbit analysis.
   Significant differences are observed between the models, though some
   similarities exist for responses with few contacts per rotor revolution.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors (SCs) have been used in energy harvesting wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) to relieve the life cycle limitations that most

   present new challenges for power management due to its high

   have been developed to reduce self-discharge loss, but few studies have
   focused on charge redistribution loss in SC-operated WSNs. In this
   paper, we investigate how SC charge redistribution affects power
   management in long-term WSN applications, and develop a practical power
   manager to reduce redistribution loss by scheduling the workload in a
   way that maintains a relatively balanced voltage between the main branch
   and the delayed branch of an SC. The manager has low computational
   complexity and yields considerably smaller charge redistribution loss
   than other power managers.}},

Abstract = {{Particles with an open, porous structure can be used to deliver
   payloads. It is often of interest to detect such particles in tissue or
   materials, which is facilitated by addition of dye. A straightforward
   approach leading to fluorescent, porous silica particles is described.
   The particles are etched with 3 mM aqueous sodium hydroxide, taking
   advantage of the etching rate difference between normal silica and an
   interior band of silica that contains covalently attached dye. No
   additional steps, such as dye labeling or thermal annealing, are
   required. Etching modeled the internal structure of the fluorescent
   silica particles by creating mesoimacropores and voids, as reflected by
   nitrogen absorption measurements. In order to investigate whether a
   polymer shell influences etching, certain composite particles are
   top-coated with poly(L-lysine) representing neutral or positive charged
   surfaces under typical pH conditions in living systems. The
   polypeptide-coated fluorescent silica cores exhibit the same porous
   morphology as uncoated homologs. The polypeptide topcoat does little to
   alter the permeation by the etching agent. Preservation of size during
   etching, confirmed by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron
   microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering, simplifies the use of these
   template-free porous fluorescent particles as platforms for drug
   encapsulation, drug carriers and in vivo imaging. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Superlative properties of nanocomposites have motivated considerable
   research efforts in recent years. Nanocomposite plates of quadrilateral
   shapes are important structural components used in a variety of
   engineering structures. This article aims to develop a variational
   formulation to describe the vibrational behavior of functionally graded
   (FG) nanocomposite straight-sided quadrilateral plates reinforced by
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in thermal environments. Various profiles of
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) distribution along the thickness
   are taken into consideration. The mathematical formulation is developed
   in the variational form based on the first order shear defamation plate
   theory (FSDPT) with consideration of thermal effects. Discretization
   process of the energy functional is done on a computational domain using
   a mapping-differential quadrature (DQ) methodology. Discrete form of the
   governing equations is directly derived from a weak formulation which
   does not involve any transformation and discretization of the high order
   derivatives appeared in the equations of the strong form. Numerical
   results are given and compared with the ones reported in the literature
   to evaluate the convergence behavior and accuracy of the proposed
   solution. Subsequently, the influences of temperature on natural
   frequencies of the nanocomposite quadrilateral plates with different
   geometric parameters, CNT distributions in thickness direction and
   boundary conditions are investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper presents a Compressed Sensing technique for the reconstruction
   of guided wavefields. Structural inspections based on the analysis of
   guided wavefields have proven to be effective at detecting and
   characterizing damage. However, wavefield detection is often a time

   reconstruction technique estimates the location of sources and
   structural features interacting with the waves from a set of sparse
   measurements. Such features include damage, described as a scattering
   source. The wavefield is reconstructed by employing information on the
   dispersion properties of the medium under consideration. The procedure
   is illustrated through a one-dimensional analytical example, and
   subsequently applied to the reconstruction of an experimental wavefield
   in a composite panel with an artificial delamination. The results
   confirm the ability of the technique to identify the defect, while
   reconstructing the wavefield with good accuracy using a significantly

Abstract = {{Wireless microsensors in hospitals, factories, and farms can manage and
   save lives and resources. Although tiny batteries cannot sustain them
   for long, harvesters can because ambient energy is abundant.
   Photovoltaic cells are popular in this regard because they output close
   to 100x more power from solar light than piezoelectric, electrostatic,
   and thermoelectric generators can from motion and heat. However, since
   mm cells can only supply mu W's of the mW's that microsystems can draw,
   and light is not always available, battery assistance is necessary. So
   to supply functions and sustain operation across extended periods, the
   system should extract maximum ambient power, draw minimal battery
   assistance, and deliver as much power as possible. The 0.18-mu m CMOS
   harvester presented here does this, draws 10-100 mu W from a 3 x 3 x 1
   mm(3) cell and assistance from a battery to supply a 1-mW load and
   recharge the battery with excess cell power. The switched-inductor
   charger supply regulates 1 V within +/- 25 mV with 73-86\%
   power-conversion efficiency and keeps the cell within 1\% of its maximum
   power point. This way, the cell outputs 100 mu W/mm(2) from solar light
   and 1 mu W/mm(2) from direct indoor light.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of distributed generation (DG) such as photovoltaics (PV)
   represents a challenge for the traditional operation of distribution
   power systems. As the installed power of DGs grows, grid codes are being
   modified to involve DGs in the provision of ancillary services. This
   includes the ability to ride-through large disturbances. In this paper,
   the behavior of a single-stage PV system under unbalanced voltage
   conditions is studied, and a fault ride-through control scheme is
   proposed which is able to support the grid through the injection of
   reactive power. Furthermore, adjustable power quality is enabled as a
   tradeoff between power ripple and current harmonics. The control scheme
   makes use of a current controller based on the space vector Fourier
   transform concept. No rotational transformation is required, and zero
   steady-state error is ensured when tracking distorted current
   references. The controller was tested in detailed PSCAD/EMTDC computer
   simulations, and implemented in a real grid-connected PV system to
   demonstrate its performance under unbalanced voltage conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from consistent,
   viable, >500 mu m thick tissue preparations over time periods from days
   to weeks may aid in studying a wide range of problems in neurobiology
   that require in vivo-like organotypic morphology. Existing tools for
   electrically interfacing with organotypic slices do not address necrosis
   that inevitably occurs within thick slices with limited diffusion of
   nutrients and gas, and limited removal of waste. We developed an
   integrated device that enables long-term maintenance of thick,
   functionally active, brain tissue models using interstitial perfusion
   and distributed recordings from thick sections of explanted tissue on a
   perforated multi-electrode array. This novel device allows for automated
   culturing, in situ imaging, and extracellular multi-electrode
   interfacing with brain slices, 3-D cell cultures, and potentially other
   tissue culture models. The device is economical, easy to assemble, and
   integrable with standard electrophysiology tools. We found that
   convective perfusion through the culture thickness provided a functional
   benefit to the preparations as firing rates were generally higher in
   perfused cultures compared to their respective unperfused controls. This
   work is a step toward the development of integrated tools for days-long
   experiments with more consistent, healthier, thicker, and functionally
   more active tissue cultures with built-in distributed
   electrophysiological recording and stimulation functionality. The
   results may be useful for the study of normal processes, pathological
   conditions, and drug screening strategies currently hindered by the
   limitations of acute (a few hours long) brain slice preparations.}},

Title = {{Antecedent Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: What Is Protecting
   Whom?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Multiple studies have shown that antecedent diseases are less prevalent
   in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients than the general
   age-matched population, which suggests possible neuroprotection.
   Antecedent disease could be protective against ALS or, conversely, the
   asymptomatic early physiological underpinnings of ALS could be
   protective against other antecedent disease. Elucidating the impact of
   antecedent disease on ALS is critical for assessing diagnostic risk
   factors, prognostic outcomes, and intervention timing. The objective of
   this study was to examine the relationship between antecedent conditions
   and ALS onset age and disease duration (i.e. survival). Medical history
   surveys for 1439 Emory ALS Clinic patients (Atlanta, GA, USA) were
   assessed for antecedent hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity,
   asthma, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
   thyroid, kidney, liver, and other non-ALS neurological diseases. The ALS
   onset age and disease duration are compared between the antecedent and
   non-antecedent populations using chi square, Kaplan-Meier, and ordinal
   logistic regression. When controlled for confounders, antecedent
   hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol),
   arthritis, COPD, thyroid disease, and non-ALS neurological disease are
   found to be statistically associated with a delayed ALS onset age,
   whereas antecedent obesity {[}body mass index (BMI) > 30] was correlated
   to earlier ALS onset age. With the potential exceptions of liver disease
   and diabetes (the latter without other common comorbid conditions),
   antecedent disease is associated with overall shorter ALS disease
   duration. The unique potential relationship between antecedent liver
   disease and longer ALS disease duration warrants further investigation,
   especially given liver disease was found to be a factor of 4-7 times
   less prevalent in ALS. Notably, most conditions associated with delayed
   ALS onset are also associated with shorter disease duration.
   Pathological homeostatic instability exacerbated by hypervigilant
   regulation (over-zealous homeostatic regulation due to too high
   regulatory feedback gains) is a viable hypothesis for explaining the
   early-life protection against antecedent disease and the overall lower
   antecedent disease prevalence in ALS patients; the later ALS onset age
   in patients with antecedent disease; and the inverse relationship
   between ALS onset age and disease duration.}},

Abstract = {{We outline a modeling study of an extrinsic semiconductor interface
   formed from the interaction of nanostructured metal oxide decorated
   porous silicon and used for sensing gas phase analytes. We consider
   simple conductometric sensors that operate at room temperature and
   atmospheric pressure. Nanostructured metal oxide deposition provides a
   matrix of responses to various analytes, facilitating the extraction of
   ambient gas concentrations from sensor responses. The sensors are
   simulated in four stages with an emphasis to the continual improvement
   of the modeling effort. Stage 1 focuses solely on the diffusion
   mechanics of an analyte gas into and out of a micro/nanoporous interface
   and the observed linear response at low concentrations. Stage 2 focuses
   on the non-linearity resulting primarily from the quenching of sensor
   response at higher concentrations and introduces an absorption response
   mechanism. Here, stage 3 demonstrates how the consideration of charge
   carrier density leads to the development of a new Fermi-distribution
   based response mechanism. Stage 4 establishes a combined
   absorption-Fermi-distribution response mechanism. (C) 2016 AIP

Title = {{Reactor physics modelling of accident tolerant fuel for LWRs using
   ANSWERS codes}},
Journal = {{EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES \& TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{The majority of nuclear reactors operating in the world today and
   similarly the majority of near-term new build reactors will be LWRs.
   These currently accommodate traditional Zr clad UO2/PuO2 fuel designs
   which have an excellent performance record for normal operation.
   However, the events at Fukushima culminated in significant hydrogen
   production and hydrogen explosions, resulting from high temperature
   Zr/steam interaction following core uncovering for an extended period.
   These events have resulted in increased emphasis towards developing more
   accident tolerant fuels (ATFs)-clad systems, particularly for current
   and near-term build LWRs. R\&D programmes are underway in the US and
   elsewhere to develop ATFs and the UK is engaging in these international
   programmes. Candidate advanced fuel materials include uranium nitride
   (UN) and uranium silicide (U3Si2). Candidate cladding materials include
   advanced stainless steel (FeCrAl) and silicon carbide. The UK has a long
   history in industrial fuel manufacture and fabrication for a wide range
   of reactor systems including LWRs. This is supported by a national
   infrastructure to perform experimental and theoretical R\&D in fuel
   performance, fuel transient behaviour and reactor physics. In this
   paper, an analysis of the Integral Inherently Safe LWR design
   ((IS)-S-2-LWR), a reactor concept developed by an international
   collaboration led by the Georgia Institute of Technology, within a US
   DOE Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) Integrated Research Project
   (IRP) is considered. The analysis is performed using the ANSWERS reactor
   physics code WIMS and the EDF Energy core simulator PANTHER by
   researchers at the University of Cambridge. The I2S-LWR is an advanced
   2850 MWt integral PWR with inherent safety features. In order to enhance
   the safety features, the baseline fuel and cladding materials that were
   chosen for the (IS)-S-2-LWR design are U3Si2 and advanced stainless
   steel respectively. In addition, the (IS)-S-2-LWR design adopts an
   integral configuration and a fully passive decay heat removal system to
   provide indefinite cooling capability for a class of accidents. This
   paper presents the equilibrium cycle core design and reactor physics
   behaviour of the (IS)-S-2-LWR with U3Si2 and the advanced steel
   cladding. The results were obtained using the traditional two-stage
   approach, in which homogenized macroscopic cross-section sets were
   generated by WIMS and applied in a full 3D core solution with PANTHER.
   The results obtained with WIMS/PANTHER were compared against the Monte
   Carlo Serpent code developed by VTT and previously reported results for
   the (IS)-S-2-LWR. The results were found to be in a good agreement (e.g.
   <200 pcm in reactivity) among the compared codes, giving confidence that
   the WIMS/PANTHER reactor physics package can be reliably used in
   modelling advanced LWR systems.}},

Abstract = {{The bidirectional shortest path problem has important applications in
   VLSI floor planning and other areas. We introduce a new algorithm to
   solve bidirectional shortest path problems using parallel architectures
   provided by general purpose computing on graphics processing units. The
   algorithm performs parallel searches from the source and sink using
   Dijkstra's classic approach modified with pruning and early termination.
   We achieve substantial speedup over a parallel method that performs a
   single parallel search on the GPGPU from the source to all other nodes
   but early terminates when the shortest path to the specified target node
   is found. Experimental results demonstrate a speedup of nearly 2x over
   the parallel method that performs a parallel search from the source with
   early termination on the GPGPU.}},

Title = {{Modeling the Excess Cell Surface Stored in a Complex Morphology of
   Bleb-Like Protrusions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Cells transition from spread to rounded morphologies in diverse
   physiological contexts including mitosis and mesenchymal-to-amoeboid
   transitions. When these drastic shape changes occur rapidly, cell volume
   and surface area are approximately conserved. Consequently, the rounded
   cells are suddenly presented with a several-fold excess of cell surface
   whose area far exceeds that of a smooth sphere enclosing the cell
   volume. This excess is stored in a population of bleb-like protrusions
   (BLiPs), whose size distribution is shown by electron micrographs to be
   skewed. We introduce three complementary models of rounded cell
   morphologies with a prescribed excess surface area. A 2D Hamiltonian
   model provides a mechanistic description of how discrete attachment
   points between the cell surface and cortex together with surface bending
   energy can generate a morphology that satisfies a prescribed excess area
   and BLiP number density. A 3D random seed-and-growth model simulates
   efficient packing of BLiPs over a primary rounded shape, demonstrating a
   pathway for skewed BLiP size distributions that recapitulate 3D
   morphologies. Finally, a phase field model (2D and 3D) posits
   energy-based constitutive laws for the cell membrane, nematic F-actin
   cortex, interior cytosol, and external aqueous medium. The cell surface
   is equipped with a spontaneous curvature function, a proxy for the cell
   surface-cortex couple, that is a priori unknown, which the model
   ``learns{''} from the thin section transmission electron micrograph
   image (2D) or the ``seed and growth{''} model image (3D). Converged
   phase field simulations predict self-consistent amplitudes and spatial
   localization of pressure and stress throughout the cell for any posited
   stationary morphology target and cell compartment constitutive
   properties. The models form a general framework for future studies of
   cell morphological dynamics in a variety of biological contexts.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a unified framework to address the problem of
   optimal nonlinear analysis and feedback control for partial stability
   and partial-state stabilization. Partial asymptotic stability of the
   closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov
   function that is positive definite and decrescent with respect to part
   of the system state, which can clearly be seen to be the solution to the
   steady-state form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and hence
   guaranteeing both partial stability and optimality. The overall
   framework provides the foundation for extending optimal linear-quadratic
   controller synthesis to nonlinear nonquadratic optimal partial-state
   stabilization. Connections to optimal linear and nonlinear regulation
   for linear and nonlinear time-varying systems with quadratic and
   nonlinear nonquadratic cost functionals are also provided. Finally, we
   also develop optimal feedback controllers for affine nonlinear systems
   using an inverse optimality framework tailored to the partial-state
   stabilization problem and use this result to address polynomial and
   multilinear forms in the performance criterion. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{In this study, the flaky graphite/cobalt zinc ferrite composites were
   synthesized by the coprecipitation method. The XRD results showed that
   the flaky graphite/cobalt zinc ferrite composites can be obtained and
   there is no impurity when the graphite weight ratio is less than 20
   wt\%. The FE-SEM results exhibited that the flaky graphite/cobalt zinc
   ferrite composites possessed flake-like shape with high aspect ratio.
   Moreover, the electromagnetic properties could be tuned by varying the
   graphite weight ratio. In the series of as-prepared flaky
   graphite/cobalt zinc ferrite composites, the sample with 10 wt\%
   graphite possessed excellent impedance matching performance. As a
   result, the it exhibited the best microwave absorption properties. The
   reflection loss was less than -10 dB in frequency range of 10.3-13.5 GHz
   and the maximum reflection loss was reach to -33.85 dB at 11.7 GHz when
   the coating thickness was 2.5 mm. Moreover, the electromagnetic analysis
   demonstrated that the electromagnetic loss properties and the
   electromagnetic impedance matching performance should be both satisfied
   to obtain the excellent microwave absorption properties. This study was
   meaningful to design the ferrite/ carbon composites based microwave
   absorbers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Packaging is a critical aspect of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG)
   toward practical applications, since the performance of TENG is greatly
   affected by environmental conditions such as humidity. A waterproof
   triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator (WPHG) for harvesting
   mechanical energy in harsh environments is reported. Since the
   mechanical transmission from the external mechanical source to the TENG
   is through a noncontact force between the paired magnets, a fully
   isolated packaging of TENG part can be easily achieved. At the same
   time, combining with metal coils, these magnets can be fabricated to be
   electromagnetic generators (EMG). The characteristics and advantages of
   outputs from both TENG and EMG are systematically studied and compared
   to each other. By using transformers and full-wave rectifiers, 2.3 mA
   for total short-circuit current and 5 V for open-circuit voltage are
   obtained for WPHG under a rotation speed of 1600 rpm, and it can charge
   a supercapacitor (20 mF) to 1 V in 22s. Finally, the WPHG is
   demonstrated to harvest wind energy in the rainy condition and
   water-flow energy under water. The reported WPHG renders an effective
   and sustainable technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting in
   harsh environments. Solid progress in both the packaging of TENG and the
   practical applications of the hybrid generator toward practical power
   source and self-powered systems is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems, consisting of fullerenes
   dispersed in conjugated polymers have been actively studied in order to
   produce high performance organic photovoltaics. How the BHJ morphology
   affects device efficiency, is currently ill-understood. Neutron
   reflection together with grazing incidence X-ray and neutron scattering
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are utilized to gain understanding
   of the BHJ morphology in functional devices. For nine model systems,
   based on mixtures of three poly(3-alkyl thiophenes, P3AT) (A = butyl,
   hexyl, octyl) blended with three different fullerene derivatives, the
   BHJ morphology through the film thickness is determined. It is shown
   that fullerene enrichment occurs at both the electrode interfaces after
   annealing. The degree of fullerene enrichment is found to strongly
   correlate with the short circuit current (J(SC)) and to a lesser degree
   with the fill factor. Based on these findings, it is demonstrated that
   by deliberately adding a fullerene layer at the electron transport layer
   interface, J(SC) can be increased by up to 20\%, resulting in an overall
   increase in power conversion efficiency of 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Development of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of prime
   importance to emerging renewable energy technologies. Here, we report a
   simple and effective strategy for enhancing ORR and OER electrocatalytic
   activity in alkaline solution by introducing A-site cation deficiency in
   LaFeO3 perovskite; the enhancement effect is more pronounced for the OER
   than the ORR Among the A-site cation deficient perovskites studied,
   La0.95FeO3-delta (L0.95F) demonstrates the highest ORR and OER activity
   and, hence, the best bifunctionality. The dramatic enhancement is
   attributed to the creation of surface oxygen vacancies and a small
   amount of Fe4+ species. This work highlights the importance of tuning
   cation deficiency in perovskites as an effective strategy for enhancing
   ORR and OER activity for applications in various oxygen-based energy
   storage and conversion processes.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and dynamics of a model branched polymer was investigated
   through molecular dynamics simulations and neutron scattering
   experiments. The polymer confinement, monomer concentration, and solvent
   quality were varied in the simulations and detailed comparisons between
   the calculated structural and dynamical properties of the unconfined
   polymer and those confined within an adsorbing and nonadsorbing
   cylindrical pore, representing the silica based structural support of
   the composite, were made. The simulations show a direct relationship in
   the structure of the polymer and the nonmonotonic dynamics as a function
   of monomer concentration within an adsorbing cylindrical pore. However,
   the nonmonotonic behavior disappears for the case of the branched
   polymer within a nonadsorbing cylindrical pore. Overall, the simulation
   results are in good agreement with quasi-elastic neutron scattering
   (QENS) studies of branched poly(ethylenimine) in mesoporous silica
   (SBA-15) of comparable size, suggesting an approach that can be a useful
   guide for understanding how to tune porous polymer composites for
   enhancing desired dynamical and structural behavior targeting carbon
   dioxide adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{Limited knowledge exists about the forces acting on mitral valve
   annuloplasty repair devices. The aim of this study was to develop a new
   mitral annular force transducer to measure the forces acting on
   clinically used mitral valve annuloplasty devices. The design of an
   X-shaped transducer in the present study was optimized for simultaneous
   in- and out-of-plane force measurements. Each arm was mounted with
   strain gauges on four circumferential elements to measure out-of-plane
   forces, and the central parts of the X-arms were mounted with two strain
   gauges to measure in-plane forces. A dedicated calibration setup was
   developed to calibrate isolated forces with tension and compression for
   in- and out-of-plane measurements. With this setup, it was possible with
   linear equations to isolate and distinguish measured forces between the
   two planes and minimize transducer arm crosstalk. An in-vitro test was
   performed to verify the crosstalk elimination method and the assumptions
   behind it. The force transducer was implanted and evaluated in an 80 kg
   porcine in-vivo model. Following crosstalk elimination, in-plane
   systolic force accumulation was found to be in average 4.0 +/- 0.1 N and
   the out-of-plane annular segments experienced an average force of 1.4
   +/- 0.4 N. Directions of the systolic out-of-plane forces indicated
   movements towards a saddle shaped annulus, and the transducer was able
   to measure independent directional forces in individual annular
   segments. Further measurements with the new transducer coupled viiith
   clinical annuloplasty rings will provide a detailed insight into the
   biomechanical dynamics of these devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this experiment, hysteresis is observed in the floating potential of
   wall material samples immersed in a low-temperature plasma as the energy
   of a prevalent non-thermal electron population is varied from 30-180 eV.
   It is indicated that the hysteresis is due to secondary electron
   emission from the wall material surface. Measurements are performed in a
   filament discharge in argon gas pressure 10(-4) Torr of order 10(7)
   cm(-3) plasma number density. The primary ionizing electrons from the
   discharge filament make up 1\%-10\% of the overall plasma number
   density, depending on discharge voltage. Immersed LaB6-coated steel and
   roughened boron nitride (BN) wall material samples are mounted on the
   face of a radiative heater, and the wall temperature is controlled from
   50-400 degrees C such that thermionic emission from the LaB6-coated
   sample is not significant. The energy of the primary plasma electrons
   from the discharge filament is varied and the floating potentials of the
   material samples are monitored. The floating potentials are observed to
   transition to a ``collapsed{''} state as the primary electron energy is
   increased above 110 and 130 eV for the LaB6 and rough BN, respectively.
   As primary electron energy is subsequently decreased, the floating
   potentials do not ``un-collapse{''} until lower energies of 80 and 100
   eV, respectively. The hysteresis behavior agrees with a kinetic model.
   The results may help explain observations of global hysteresis and mode
   transitions in bounded plasma devices with dielectric walls, significant
   secondary electron emission, and departures of electron energy
   distribution function from a thermal Maxwellian. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The dynamic yielding and fracture (spalling) of commercially pure (grade
   4) titanium are investigated using symmetric plate impact experiments
   for a peak stress range of 5.6 GPa-12.5 GPa. Velocity interferometry
   system for any reflector rear free surface velocity profiles display
   both a Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and a velocity pullback, which are
   indicative of dynamic compressive yielding and tensile fracture
   (spalling), respectively. The HEL decreases with peak stress from 2.2
   GPa for 5.6 GPa peak stress to 2.0 GPa for 12.5 GPa peak stress. The
   decrease in the HEL corresponded to an increase in twinning observed in
   recovered samples. The spall strength increases with peak stress from
   3.3 GPa to 3.8 GPa over the measured peak stress range and shows a good
   power law fit with the decompression strain rate. The differences in the
   dynamic yield and fracture behavior indicate that void nucleation is the
   dominant mechanism affecting the spall strength of grade 4 titanium. (C)

Abstract = {{Arc-discharge effects on the residual stress and refractive index in

   discharges in single-mode fibers were measured. Refractive index changes
   greater than 10(-4) and longitudinal perturbation lengths of less than

   arc-induced longperiod fiber gratings are analyzed, and a typical
   transmission resonance is predicted to have a depth of 56 dB and a
   bandwidth of 0.08 nm at a wavelength of 1585 nm. The results of this
   investigation will be useful in modeling device performance and

Abstract = {{Extending the spectral absorption of organolead halide perovskite solar
   cells from visible into near-infrared (NIR) range renders the
   minimization of non-absorption loss of solar photons with improved
   energy alignment. Herein, we report on, for the first time, a viable
   strategy of capitalizing on judiciously synthesized monodisperse
   NaYF4:Yb/Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as the mesoporous
   electrode for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells and more importantly
   confer perovskite solar cells to be operative under NIR light. Uniform
   NaYF4:Yb/Er UCNPs are first crafted by employing rationally designed
   double hydrophilic star-like poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PAA-b-PEO) diblock copolymer as nanoreactor, imparting the
   solubility of UCNPs and the tunability of film porosity during the
   manufacturing process. The subsequent incorporation of NaYF4:Yb/Er UCNPs
   as the mesoporous electrode led to a high efficiency of 17.8\%, which
   was further increased to 18.1\% upon NIR irradiation. The insitu
   integration of upconversion materials as functional components of
   perovskite solar cells offers the expanded flexibility for engineering
   the device architecture and broadening the solar spectral use.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were
   performed to better understand the hydrodynamic behavior of water
   flowing through silicon nanochannels. Thewater-silicon interaction
   potential was calibrated by means of size-independent molecular dynamics
   simulations of silicon wettability. The wettability of silicon was found
   to be dependent on the strength of the water-silicon interaction and the
   structure of the underlying surface. As a result, the anisotropy was
   found to be an important factor in the wettability of these types of
   crystalline solids. Using this premise as a fundamental starting point,
   the hydrodynamic slip in nanoconfined water was characterized using both
   equilibrium and nonequilibrium calculations of the slip length under low
   shear rate operating conditions. As was the case for the wettability
   analysis, the hydrodynamic slip was found to be dependent on the wetted
   solid surface atomic structure. Additionally, the interfacial water
   liquid structure was the most significant parameter to describe the
   hydrodynamic boundary condition. The calibration of the water-silicon
   interaction potential performed by matching the experimental contact
   angle of silicon led to the verification of the no-slip condition,
   experimentally reported for silicon nanochannels at low shear rates.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{We studied the modal contributions to heat conduction at crystalline Si
   and crystalline Ge interfaces and found that more than 15\% of the
   interface conductance arises from less than 0.1\% of the modes in the
   structure. Using the recently developed interface conductance modal
   analysis (ICMA) method along with a new complimentary methodology, we
   mapped the correlations between modes, which revealed that a small group
   of interfacial modes, which exist between 12-13 THz, exhibit extremely
   strong correlation with other modes in the system. It is found that
   these interfacial modes (e.g., modes with large eigen vectors for
   interfacial atoms) are enabled by the degree of anharmonicity near the
   interface, which is higher than in the bulk, and therefore allows this
   small group of modes to couple to all others. The analysis sheds light
   on the nature of localized vibrations at interfaces and can be
   enlightening for other investigations of localization.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) is known to be the
   most efficacious treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).
   Unfortunately, poor adherence behaviour in using CPAP reduces its
   effectiveness and thereby also limits beneficial outcomes. In this
   paper, we model the dynamics and patterns of patient adherence behaviour
   as a basis for designing effective and economical interventions.
   Specifically, we define patient CPAP usage behaviour as a state and
   develop Markov models for diverse patient cohorts in order to examine
   the stochastic dynamics of CPAP usage behaviours. We also examine the
   impact of behavioural intervention scenarios using a Markov decision
   process (MDP), and suggest a guideline for designing interventions to
   improve CPAP adherence behaviour. Behavioural intervention policy that
   addresses economic aspects of treatment is imperative for translation to
   clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained environments
   that are clinically engaged in the chronic care of OSA. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Despite the unparalleled theoretical gravimetric energy, Li-O-2
   batteries are still under a research stage because of their insufficient
   cycle lives. While the reversibility in air-cathodes has been lately
   improved significantly by the deepened understanding on the
   electrode-electrolyte reaction and the integration of diverse catalysts,
   the stability of the Li metal interface has received relatively much
   less attention. The destabilization of the Li metal interface by
   crossover of water and oxygen from the air-cathode side can indeed cause
   as fatal degradation for the cycle life as the irreversibility of the
   air-cathodes. Here, it is reported that cheap poreless polyurethane
   separator can effectively suppress this crossover while allowing Li ions
   to diffuse through selectively. The polyurethane separator also protects
   Li metal anodes from redox mediators used for enhancing the
   reversibility of the air-cathode reaction. Based on the Li metal
   protection, a persistent capacity of 600 mAh g(-1) is preserved for more
   than 200 cycles. The current approach can be readily applicable to many
   other rechargeable batteries that suffer from similar interfacial
   degradation by side products from the other electrode.}},

Title = {{The effects of ethanol on the size-exclusion characteristics of type I
   dentin collagen to adhesive resin monomers}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{235-241}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{During dentin bonding with etch-and-rinse adhesive systems, phosphoric
   acid etching of mineralized dentin solubilizes the mineral crystallites
   and replaces them with bound and unbound water. During the infiltration
   phase of dentin bonding, solvated adhesive resin comonomers are supposed
   to replace all of the unbound collagen water and polymerize into
   copolymers. A recently published review suggested that dental monomers
   are too large to enter and displace water from tightly-packed collagen
   molecules. Conversely, recent work from the authors' laboratory
   demonstrated that HEMA and TEGDMA freely equilibrate with
   water-saturated dentin matrices. However, because adhesive blends are
   solvated in organic solvents, those solvents may remove enough free
   water to allow collagen molecules to come close enough to exclude
   adhesive monomer permeation. The present study analyzed the
   size-exclusion characteristics of dentin collagen, using a gel
   permeation-like column chromatography technique, filled with dentin
   powder instead of Sephadex beads as the stationary phase. The elution
   volumes of different sized test molecules, including adhesive resin
   monomers, studied in both water saturated dentin, and again in
   ethanol-dehydrated dentin powder, showed that adhesive resin monomers
   can freely diffuse into both hydrated and dehydrated collagen molecules.
   Under these in vitro conditions, all free and some of the loosely-bound
   water seems to have been removed by ethanol. These results validate the
   concept that adhesive resin monomers can permeate tightly-bound water in
   ethanol-saturated collagen molecules during infiltration by
   etch-and-rinse adhesives.
   Statement of Significance
   It has been reported that collagen molecules in dentin matrices are
   packed too close together to allow permeation of adhesive monomers
   between them. Resin infiltration, in this view, would be limited to
   extrafibrillar spaces. Our work suggests that monomers equilibrate with
   collagen water in both water and ethanol-saturated dentin matrices. (C)

Abstract = {{We extend the theory of low-rank matrix recovery and completion to the
   case when Poisson observations for a linear combination or a subset of
   the entries of a matrix are available, which arises in various
   applications with count data. We consider the usual matrix recovery
   formulation through maximum likelihood with proper constraints on the
   matrix of size -by-, and establish theoretical upper and lower bounds on
   the recovery error. Our bounds for matrix completion are nearly optimal
   up to a factor on the order of O(log(d(1)d(2)) These bounds are obtained
   by combining techniques for recovering sparse vectors with compressed
   measurements in Poisson noise, those for analyzing low-rank matrices, as
   well as those for one-bit matrix completion {[}Davenport et al., ``1-bit
   Matrix Completion, Information and Inference,{''} Information and
   Inference, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 189-223, Sep. 2014] (although these two
   problems are different in nature). The adaptation requires new
   techniques exploiting properties of the Poisson likelihood function and
   tackling the difficulties posed by the locally sub-Gaussian
   characteristic of the Poisson distribution. Our results highlight a few
   important distinctions of the Poisson case compared to the prior work
   including having to impose a minimum signal-to-noise requirement on each
   observed entry and a gap in the upper and lower bounds. We also develop
   a set of efficient iterative algorithms and demonstrate their good
   performance on synthetic examples and real data.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we propose a probabilistic approach for coupled
   distributed hydrological-hillslope stability models that accounts for
   soil parameters uncertainty at basin scale. The geotechnical and soil
   retention curve parameters are treated as random variables across the
   basin and theoretical probability distributions of the Factor of Safety
   (FS) are estimated. The derived distributions are used to obtain the
   spatio-temporal dynamics of probability of failure, in terms of
   parameters uncertainty, conditioned to soil moisture dynamics. The
   framework has been implemented in the tRIBS-VEGGIE (Triangulated
   Irregular Network (TIN)-based Real-time Integrated Basin
   Simulator-VEGetation Generator for Interactive Evolution)-Landslide
   model and applied to a basin in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Puerto
   Rico) where shallow landslides are common. In particular, the
   methodology was used to evaluate how the spatial and temporal patterns
   of precipitation, whose variability is significant over the basin,
   affect the distribution of probability of failure, through event scale
   analyses. Results indicate that hyetographs where heavy precipitation is
   near the end of the event lead to the most critical conditions in terms
   of probability of failure. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effects of modifying indium tin oxide electrodes with
   ultrathin titania (TiO2) layers grown via plasma-enhanced atomic layer

   titania by tracking performance, which initially increases, peaks, and
   eventually decreases with increasing TiO2 thickness. We use scanning
   Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) to measure both the local work function
   and its distribution as a function of TiO2 thickness. We find that the
   variance in contact potential difference across the surface of the film
   is related to either the amorphous or anatase TiO2 form. Finally, we use
   local SKPM recombination rate experiments, supported by bulk transient
   photovoltage and charge extraction measurements. We show that the
   optimum TiO2 thickness is the one for which the carrier lifetime is the
   longest and the charge carrier density is the highest, when the TiO2 is
   amorphous, in agreement with the device measurements. (C) 2016 AIP

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{A multi-port electrostatically driven silicon acoustic cavity is
   implemented that efficiently traps the energy of a temperature-stable
   eigen-mode with Lame cross-sectional polarization. Dispersive behavior
   of propagating and evanescent guided waves in a < 100 >-aligned single
   crystal silicon waveguide is used to engineer the acoustic energy
   distribution of a specific shear eigen-mode that is well known for its
   low temperature sensitivity when implemented in doped single crystal
   silicon. Such an acoustic energy trapping in the central region of the
   acoustic cavity geometry and far from substrate obviates the need for
   narrow tethers that are conventionally used for non-destructive and high
   quality factor (Q) energy suspension in MEMS resonators; therefore, the
   acoustically engineered waveguide can simultaneously serve as in-situ
   self-oven by passing large uniformly distributed DC currents through its
   body and without any concern about perturbing the mode shape or
   deforming narrow supports. Such a stable thermo-structural performance
   besides large turnover temperatures than can be realized in Lame
   eigen-modes make this device suitable for implementation of ultra-stable
   oven-controlled oscillators. 78 MHz prototypes implemented in
   arsenic-doped single crystal silicon substrates with different
   resistivity are transduced by in-and out-of-plane narrow-gap capacitive
   ports, showing high Q of similar to 43k. The low resistivity device
   shows an overall temperature-induced frequency drift of 200 ppm over the
   range of -20 degrees C to 80 degrees C, which is similar to 15x smaller
   compared to overall frequency drift measured for the similar yet high
   resistivity device in the same temperature range. Furthermore, a
   frequency tuning of similar to 2100 ppm is achieved in high resistivity
   device by passing 45 mA DC current through its body. Continuous
   operation of the device under such a self-ovenizing current over 10 days
   did not induce frequency instability or degradation in Q. (C) 2016 AIP

Title = {{MULTIWAVELENGTH STUDY OF QUIESCENT STATES OF Mrk 421 WITH UNPRECEDENTED

Abstract = {{We present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright,
   nearby BL Lacertae object Mrk 421 taken in 2013 January-March, involving
   GASP-WEBT, Swift, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, VERITAS, and other
   collaborations and instruments, providing data from radio to very high
   energy. (VHE).-ray bands. NuSTAR yielded previously unattainable
   sensitivity in the 3-79. keV range, revealing that the spectrum softens
   when the source is dimmer until the X-ray spectral shape saturates into
   a steep Gamma approximate to 3 power law, with no evidence for an
   exponential cutoff or additional hard components up to similar to 80.
   keV. For the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and the
   inverse-Compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (SED)
   simultaneously shifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state
   by an order of magnitude. The fractional variability as a function of
   photon energy shows a double-bump structure that relates to the two
   bumps of the broadband SED. In each bump, the variability increases with
   energy, which, in the framework of the synchrotron self-Compton model,
   implies that the electrons with higher energies are more variable. The
   measured multi band variability, the significant X-ray-to-VHE
   correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed in both
   bands, the lack of correlation between optical/UV and X-ray flux, the
   low degree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the
   short estimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer
   variability timescale observed in the NuSTAR light curves point toward
   in situ electron acceleration and suggest that there are multiple
   compact regions contributing to the broadband emission of Mrk 421 during
   low-activity states.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we present a simple approach to fabricate the
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   that can be effectively harvest irregular mechanical energy and the
   energy used to drive a small commercial electronic component. The device
   exhibited the maximum open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of
   6.3V and 0.635 mu A respectively, with maximum output power of 178 nW.
   In addition, we measured the performance of the fabricated device with
   different load resistance. Finally, the fabricated PDMS-based
   triboelectric nanogenerator can directly drive 10 commercial LEDs
   connected in series, when the force is applied to the device through
   finger. These results demonstrate the potential application of
   PDMS-based triboelectric nanogenerator for self-powered systems.

Abstract = {{NOx (NxO  NO + NO2) regulates O-3 and HOx (HOx  OH + HO2) concentrations
   in the upper troposphere. In the laboratory, it is difficult to measure
   rates and branching ratios of the chemical reactions affecting NOx at
   the low temperatures and pressures characteristic of the upper
   troposphere, making direct measurements in the atmosphere especially
   useful. We report quasi-Lagrangian observations of the chemical
   evolution of an air parcel following a lightning event that results in
   high NOx concentrations. These quasi-Lagrangian measurements obtained
   during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry experiment are used to
   characterize the daytime rates for conversion of NOx to different peroxy
   nitrates, the sum of alkyl and multifunctional nitrates, and HNO3. We
   infer the following production rate constants {[}in (cm(3)/molecule)/s]
   at 225 K and 230 hPa: 7.2(+/- 5.7) X 10(-12) (CH3O2NO2), 5.1(+/- 3.1) X
   10(-13) (HO2NO2), 1.3(+/- 0.8) X 10(-11) (PAN), 7.3(+/- 3.4) X 10(-12)
   (PPN), and 6.2(+/- 2.9) X 10(-12) (HNO3). The HNO3 and HO2NO2 rates are
   similar to 30-50\% lower than currently recommended whereas the other
   rates are consistent with current recommendations to within +/- 30\%.
   The analysis indicates that HNO3 production from the HO2 and NO reaction
   (if any) must be accompanied by a slower rate for the reaction of OH
   with NO2, keeping the total combined rate for the two processes at the
   rate reported for HNO3 production above.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we develop an output feedback adaptive sliding mode
   controller for a general multicompartment lung mechanics model with
   nonlinear resistance and compliance respiratory parameters.
   Specifically, for a given clinically plausible reference volume pattern,
   we develop an adaptive sliding mode controller that accounts for input
   pressure and rate saturation constraints to automatically adjust the
   applied input pressure by the mechanical ventilator so that the total
   lung volume tracks the given reference pattern. The pressure due to lung
   muscle activity is also considered in the controller design. A
   Lyapunov-based approach is presented to show convergence of the
   closed-loop system, and the proposed control framework is applied to a
   two-compartment lung model to show the efficacy of the proposed control
   method. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Robust Thin Films-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator Arrays for
   Harvesting Bidirectional Wind Energy}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Wind-driven triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play an important role
   in harvesting energy from ambient environments. Compared to
   single-side-fixed triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG) arrays for
   harvesting single-pathway wind energy, double-side-fixed triboelectric
   nanogenerator (DTENG) arrays are developed to harvest bidirectional wind
   energy. Electrical performances of the STENG and DTENG can be improved
   due to sticky, abrasive, and electrical properties of the Ti buffer
   layers among Al, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polyimide (Kapton),
   configuring in triboelectric PTFE/Ti/Al and Al/Ti/Kapton/Ti/Al thin
   films. Short-circuit current (I-SC), open-circuit voltage (V-OC), and
   frequencies of the STENG and DTENG increase with increasing wind
   velocity ranging from 9.2 to 18.4 m s(21), revealing that the moderate
   I-SC, V-OC, frequencies, and output powers of the STENG and DTENG reach
   67 A, 57 A, 334 V, 296 V, 173 Hz, 162 Hz, 5.5 mW and 3.4 mW with a
   matched load of 4 M at airflow rate of 15.9 m s(21), respectively.
   Compared with counterparts of the single-pathway-harvested STENG arrays,
   the I-SC, durability, and stability of the bidirectional-harvested DTENG
   can be dramatically improved by a 4 3 1 array connected in parallel
   because of the improved device configuration, stickiness, and abrasion
   by adhering Ti buffer layers. The durable DTENG arrays present a step
   toward practical applications in harvesting bidirectional wind energy
   for self-powered systems and wireless sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Good dispersion of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) in the polymer matrix
   is one of the key factors to obtaining good properties in the resulting
   nanocomposites. However, the preparation of individually dispersed CNCs
   in solvents or in polymer matrices has been a challenge. In this study,
   individually dispersed wood-based CNCs have been successfully prepared
   in solvents, including dimethylformamide (DMF), H2O, and a mixture of
   H2O/DMF, by sonication of moisture-containing CNCs. The CNCs dispersions
   were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS). It is found that
   CNCs containing above about 3.8 wt \% moisture is critical for achieving
   individually dispersed CNC in solvents. Hydrodynamic radius (R-h) of
   CNCs is smaller in H2O/DMF co-solvent mixture than that in pure DMF or
   in pure H2O under same sonication treatment conditions. Experimental
   results have been corroborated using molecular simulation study.}},

Title = {{Toward the Synthesis of Sub-15 nm Ag Nanocubes with Sharp Corners and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{We report a polyol method for the facile synthesis of Ag nanocubes
   having sharp corners and edges, together with edge lengths below 15 nm.
   The rapid nucleation of Ag atoms was facilitated through the addition of
   a trace amount of SH- to generate Ag2S clusters while the corners and
   edges of the nanocubes were sharpened through the introduction of Br- as
   a regulator of the growth kinetics and a capping agent for the Ag(100)
   surface. Because of their much smaller size relative to the more
   commonly used capping agent based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone), Br- ions
   are more effective in passivating the \{100\} facets on very small Ag
   nanocubes. The mechanistic roles of these additives, along with the
   effects of their interactions with other species present in the reaction
   solution, were all systematically investigated. The concentration of SH-
   was found to be a particularly effective parameter for tuning the edge
   length of the nanocubes. As a result of the understanding gained during
   the course of this study, Ag nanocubes with uniform edge lengths
   controllable in the range of 13-23 nm could be reliably produced. The
   nanocubes of 13.4 +/- 0.4 nm in edge length constitute the smallest
   nanocrystals of this kind reported to date; they also possess sharper
   corners and edges relative to the limited examples of sub-20 nm Ag
   nanocubes reported in the literature. The availability of such small and
   sharp Ag nanocubes will open the door to an array of applications in
   plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{The triethylene glycol (TEG) was used to treat the off-gas stream
   containing 16 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high concentration
   (up to 15000 ppm) by experimental solvent absorption and ASPEN Plus
   computational simulation, respectively. This solvent absorption
   technology (SAT) not only purifies the off-gas but also recovers the
   VOCs. The effects of some typical operational parameters, including
   temperature, pressure, liquid loading rate, ratio of absorption liquid
   to gas flow rates, and absorption column height, on the absorption
   efficiency have been systematically investigated. Simulation results
   show that the optimal operational conditions are determined as 30
   degrees C, 0.5 MPa (absolute), recycling TEG (with a purity of 99.9\%)
   to a gas ratio of 4:1 by weight, and 8 theoretical stages. In addition,
   two stages of thermal coupling are applied minimizing the energy
   consumption of the off-gas absorption process, leading to a reduction of
   89.77\% in energy consumption. Laboratory experiments and field tests
   show that both VOCs absorption efficiency (using TEG as absorbent) and
   regeneration efficiency are highly consistent with those of ASPEN Plus
   simulation, suggesting the feasibility of simulation. Based on
   pilot-scale tests, the equipment investment and operational costs of SAT
   have been calculated and analyzed. Results show that the SAT is
   comparable with the traditional thermal treatment but with the
   advantages of much less secondary pollution. These findings indicate
   that the solvent absorption method is a promising green technology for
   treating high VOCs off-gas.}},

Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Quantum levitation enabled by repulsive Casimir force has been desirable
   due to the potential exciting applications in passive-suspension devices
   and frictionless bearings. In this paper, dynamically tunable stable
   levitation is theoretically demonstrated based on the configuration of
   dissimilar gratings separated by an intervening fluid using exact
   scattering theory. The levitation position is insensitive to temperature
   variations and can be actively tuned by adjusting the lateral
   displacement between the two gratings. This work investigates the
   possibility of applying quantum Casimir interactions into macroscopic
   mechanical devices working in a noncontact and low-friction environment
   for controlling the position or transducing lateral movement into
   vertical displacement at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of inorganic semiconductor interfaces
   functionalized with extended pi-conjugated organic molecules can be
   strongly influenced by localized gap states or point defects, often
   present at low concentrations and hard to identify spectroscopically. At
   the same time, in transparent conductive oxides such as ZnO, the
   presence of these gap states conveys the desirable high conductivity
   necessary for function as electron-selective interlayer or electron
   collection electrode in organic optoelectronic devices. Here, we report
   on the direct spectroscopic detection of a donor state within the band
   gap of highly conductive zinc oxide by two-photon photoemission
   spectroscopy. We show that adsorption of the prototypical organic
   acceptor C-60 quenches this state by ground-state charge transfer, with
   immediate consequences on the interfacial energy level alignment.
   Comparison with computational results suggests the identity of the gap
   state as a near-surface-confined oxygen vacancy.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-metal fluoride (MF) batteries offer the highest theoretical
   energy density, exceeding that of the sulfur-lithium cells. However,
   conversion-type MF cathodes suffer from high resistance, small capacity
   utilization at room temperature, irreversible structural changes, and
   rapid capacity fading with cycling. In this study, the successful
   application of the approach to overcome such limitations and
   dramatically enhance electrochemical performance of Li-MF cells is
   reported. By using iron fluoride (FeF2) as an example, Li-MF cells
   capable of achieving near-theoretical capacity utilization are shown
   when MF is infiltrated into the carbon mesopores. Most importantly, the
   ability of electrolytes based on the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
   (LiFSI) salt is presented to successfully prevent the cathode
   dissolution and leaching via in situ formation of a Li ion permeable
   protective surface layer. This layer forms as a result of electrolyte
   reduction/oxidation reactions during the first cycle of the conversion
   reaction, thus minimizing the capacity losses during cycling. Postmortem
   analysis shows the absence of Li dendrites, which is important for safer
   use of Li metal anodes. As a result, Li-FeF2 cells demonstrate over 1000
   stable cycles. Quantum chemistry calculations and post-mortem analysis
   provide insights into the mechanisms of the passivation layer formation
   and the performance boost.}},

Title = {{Ambipolar Charge Transport in Isoindigo-Based Donor-Acceptor Polymers}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1286-1297}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{A series of donor-acceptor isoindigo (iI)-based copolymers synthesized
   with increasing numbers of thiophene rings in the repeat unit (from zero
   to three thiophene rings, including silole and germole-bridged fused
   bithiophene units) is applied toward solution processed OFET devices.
   Differential pulse voltammetry on thin films of the polymers recorded
   LUMO energy levels confined within a 0.1 eV range around 3.9 eV, while
   their bandgaps are estimated at 1.5 to 1.7 eV. The interchain
   pi-stacking distance of each sample was evaluated from the 2D-WAXS
   diffraction patterns of annealed extruded filaments and the GIWAXS
   patterns of thin films, and were found to be all in the same range,
   between 3.65 and 3.75 A for the thin films. Both p-type and n-type
   charge transport in thin film bottom gate, bottom contact transistor
   devices were recorded. In particular, the copolymer P(T-iI) containing
   one thiophene ring afforded wellbalanced ambipolar p-type and n-type
   mobilities of 0.04 cm(2)/(V s) and 0.1 cm(2)/(V s), respectively. Under
   our processing conditions, the charge transport properties evolved from
   exclusively n-type to solely p-type as the number of thiophene rings
   within the repeat unit is increased to three rings in the case of
   P(T3-iI). This was observed despite all polymers displaying similar LUMO
   energy levels, interchain pi-stacking distances, and microscopic thin
   film morphology (all face-on arrangement on the dielectric surface).
   This prompted a molecular-scale morphological analysis of P(T-iI) and
   P(T3-iI) in particular, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy in order to
   further investigate the stark difference in n-type mobilities between
   these two polymers. Using the complete assignment of solution 2D-NMR
   spectra of a thiophene-il-thiophene model compound as guideline, the
   analysis of proton carbon correlations in the solid-state 2D C-13\{H-1\}
   FSLG-HETCOR NMR spectra of P(T-iI) and P(T3-iI) revealed differences in
   the molecular environment surrounding each iI unit. The latter suggests
   a stronger correlation of neighboring it units in P(T-iI), whereas a
   stronger intermixing of iI and thiophenes prevails in P(T3-iI). We
   conclude that, in this study, the choice of the donor unit length within
   the primary structure of the D-A polymer can be responsible for
   hindering its n-type character.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer:fullerene solar cells depend heavily on the electronic coupling
   of the polymer and fullerene molecular species from which they are
   composed. The intermolecular interaction between the polymer and
   fullerene tends to be strong in efficient photovoltaic systems, as
   evidenced by efficient charge transfer processes and by large changes in
   the energetics of the polymer and fullerene when they are molecularly
   mixed. Despite the clear presence of these strong intermolecular
   interactions between the polymer and fullerene, there is not a consensus
   on the nature of these interactions. In this work, we use a combination
   of Raman spectroscopy, charge transfer state absorption, and density
   functional theory calculations to show that the intermolecular
   interactions do not appear to be caused by ground state charge transfer
   between the polymer and fullerene. We conclude that these intermolecular
   interactions are primarily van der Waals in nature.}},

Abstract = {{We report the growth of high-quality triangular GaN nanomesas, 30-nm
   thick, on the C-face of 4H-SiC using nanoselective area growth (NSAG)
   with patterned epitaxial graphene grown on SiC as an embedded mask. NSAG
   alleviates the problems of defects in heteroepitaxy, and the high
   mobility graphene film could readily provide the back low-dissipative
   electrode in GaN-based optoelectronic devices. A 5-8 graphene-layer film
   is first grown on the C-face of 4H-SiC by confinement-controlled
   sublimation of silicon carbide. Graphene is then patterned and arrays of
   75-nm-wide openings are etched in graphene revealing the SiC substrate.
   A 30-nm-thick GaN is subsequently grown by metal organic vapor phase
   epitaxy. GaN nanomesas grow epitaxially with perfect selectivity on SiC,
   in the openings patterned through graphene. The up-or-down orientation

Abstract = {{The shock-compression response of Ni + Al multilayered thin foils is
   investigated using laser-accelerated thin-foil plate-impact experiments
   over the pressure range of 2 to 11 GPa. The foils contain alternating Ni
   and Al layers (parallel but not flat) of nominally 50 nm bilayer
   spacing. The goal is to determine the equation of state and
   shock-induced reactivity of these highly reactive fully dense thin-foil
   materials. The laser-accelerated thin-foil impact set-up involved
   combined use of photon-doppler-velocimetry to monitor the acceleration
   and impact velocity of an aluminum flyer, and VISAR interferometry was
   used to monitor the back free-surface velocity of the impacted Ni + Al
   multilayered target. The shock-compression response of the Ni + Al
   target foils was determined using experimentally measured parameters and
   impedance matching approach, with error bars identified considering
   systematic and experimental errors. Meso-scale CTH shock simulations
   were performed using real imported microstructures of the cross-sections
   of the multilayered Ni + Al foils to compute the Hugoniot response
   (assuming no reaction) for correlation with their experimentally
   determined equation of state. It was observed that at particle
   velocities below similar to 150 m/s, the experimentally determined
   equation of state trend matches the CTH-predicted inert response and is
   consistent with the observed unreacted state of the recovered Ni + Al
   target foils from this velocity regime. At higher particle velocities,
   the experimentally determined equation of state deviates from the
   CTH-predicted inert response. A complete and self-sustained reaction is
   also seen in targets recovered from experiments performed at these
   higher particle velocities. The deviation in the measured equation of
   state, to higher shock speeds and expanded volumes, combined with the
   observation of complete reaction in the recovered multilayered foils,
   confirmed via microstructure characterization, is indicative of the
   occurrence of shock-induced chemical reaction occurring in the
   time-scale of the high-pressure state. TEM characterization of recovered
   shock-compressed (unreacted) Ni + Al multilayered foils exhibits
   distinct features of constituent mixing revealing jetted layers and
   inter-mixed regions. These features were primarily observed in the
   proximity of the undulations present in the alternating layers of the Ni
   + Al starting foils, suggesting the important role of such instabilities
   in promoting shock-induced intermetallic-forming reactions in the fully
   dense highly exothermic multilayered thin foils. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{A multi-tier radio access network ( RAN) combining the strength of
   fibre-optic and radio access technologies employing adaptive microwave
   photonics interfaces and radio-over-fibre (RoF) techniques is envisioned
   for future heterogeneous wireless communications. All-band radio
   spectrum from 0.1 to 100 GHz will be used to deliver wireless services
   with high capacity, high link speed and low latency. The multi-tier RAN
   will improve the cell-edge performance in an integrated heterogeneous
   environment enabled by fibre-wireless integration and networking for
   mobile fronthaul/backhaul, resource sharing and all-layer centralization
   of multiple standards with different frequency bands and modulation
   formats. In essence, this is a `no-more-cells' architecture in which
   carrier aggregation among multiple frequency bands can be easily
   achieved with seamless handover between cells. In this way, current and
   future mobile network standards such as 4G and 5G can coexist with
   optimized and continuous cell coverage using multi-tier RoF regardless
   of the underlying network topology or protocol. In terms of users'
   experience, the future-proof approach achieves the goals of system
   capacity, link speed, latency and continuous heterogeneous cell coverage
   while overcoming the bandwidth crunch in next-generation communication

Abstract = {{Generally, passive perforated tiles are used in a data center and the
   supplied airflow rate is underprovisioned; thus, the balance of the
   server air requirement is met by the hot air in the room, resulting in
   higher server inlet temperatures. Full provisioning of the supplied
   airflow rate and containing the cold aisle is expected to minimize the
   hot air leakage in the cold aisle, resulting in uniform and lower server
   inlet temperatures. Thus, the supply air temperature can be raised,
   resulting in energy savings at the chiller plant. Supplying extra air
   can be achieved using active perforated tiles, having multiple fans
   installed on them. In this paper, the underprovisioned case using
   passive tiles and the fully provisioned case using active tiles are
   investigated for both open and contained aisle conditions. Thermal field
   measurements suggest lower and uniform server inlet temperatures for the
   case with contained aisle as compared to open aisle and for the fully
   provisioned case using active tiles as compared to the underprovisioned
   case using passive tiles. System-level energy calculations suggests that
   containing the cold aisle results in lower (improved) power usage
   effectiveness (PUE); however, use of active tiles does not seem to
   improve the PUE.}},

Abstract = {{Biosensors that report endogenous protein activity in vivo can be based
   on environment-sensing fluorescent dyes. The dyes can be attached to
   reagents that bind selectively to a specific conformation of the
   targeted protein, such that binding leads to a fluorescence change. Dyes
   that are sufficiently bright for use at low, nonperturbing intracellular
   concentrations typically undergo changes in intensity rather than the
   shifts in excitation or emission maxima that would enable precise
   quantitation through ratiometric imaging. We report here mero199, an
   environment-sensing dye that undergoes a 33 nm solvent-dependent shift
   in excitation. The dye was used to generate a ratiometric biosensor of
   Cdc42 (CRIB199) without the need for additional fluorophores. CRIB199
   was used in the same cell with a FRET sensor of Rac1 activation to
   simultaneously observe Cdc42 and Rac1 activity in cellular protrusions,
   indicating that Rac1 but not Cdc42 activity was reduced during tail
   retraction, and specific protrusions had reduced Cdc42 activity. A novel
   program (EdgeProps) used to correlate localized activation with cell
   edge dynamics indicated that Rac1 was specifically reduced during
   retraction.}},

Abstract = {{We study the interaction of liquid organic solvents within the pores of
   n- and p-type porous silicon (PSi) interfaces. Several polar (acetone,
   methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and water), borderline (chloroform), and
   nonpolar (toluene and isoprene) molecular solvents have been
   characterized on distinct n- and p-type pore structures, as analyzed
   using scanning electron microscopy. Fundamental to these studies has
   been the generation of Nyquist diagrams comparing the behavior for both
   dry and solvent treated interfaces for each system studied. The results
   of these studies on an undecorated PSi interface suggest a closer
   correlation with the dipole moments associated with the applied organic
   solvents rather than their dielectric response. This is supported by the
   observed interaction of the considered solvents with metal oxide (AuxO
   (x >> 1) and SnOx) decorated PSi interfaces where nanostructured metal
   oxide-solvent dipole-dipole interactions appear to be manifest. In
   correlation with the Nyquist plots and the establishment of equivalent
   circuit models, we evaluate the real-time capacitance and conductance.
   These studies suggest the viability of array-based sensing for the

Abstract = {{In multiagent surveillance missions, a group of agents monitors some
   points of interest to provide situational awareness. For agents with
   local communication capabilities, one way to transmit the surveillance
   information to a base is streaming by the instantaneous data via
   multihop communications over a connected network. However, a connected
   communication network may become disconnected if some agents leave the
   surveillance area (for example, for refueling). This paper presents a
   locally applicable, efficient, and scalable strategy that guarantees a
   connected communication network between the base and the agents in the
   face of any agent removal. The proposed decentralized strategy is based
   on a sequence of local replacements, which are initiated by the agent
   leaving the network. It is shown that the replacement sequence always
   ends with the relocation of an agent, for which the absence from its
   current position does not disconnect the network. Furthermore, the
   optimality (that is, the minimum number of replacements) of the proposed
   scheme is improved by incorporating a local criticality notion in the
   decision mechanism. Finally, the cases are considered in which some
   agents are not allowed to execute a replacement, and it is shown that
   the proposed strategy maintains a connected communication network, even
   in the presence of such constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is regarded as an efficient tool for rare
   event simulation and has been applied in simulating bottom-up
   self-assembly processes of nanomanufacturing. Yet it has limitations to
   simulate top-down processes. In this paper, a new and generalized KMC
   mechanism, called controlled KMC or controlled KMC (cKMC), is proposed
   to simulate complete physical and chemical processes. This
   generalization is enabled by the introduction of controlled events. In
   contrast to the traditional self- assembly events in KMC, controlled
   events occur at certain times, locations, or directions, which allows
   all events to be modeled. A formal model of cKMC is also presented to
   show the generalization. The applications of cKMC to several top-down
   and bottom-up processes are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Transient electronics built with degradable organic and inorganic
   materials is an emerging area and has shown great potential for in vivo
   sensors and therapeutic devices. However, most of these devices require
   external power sources to function, which may limit their applications
   for in vivo cases. We report a biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator
   (BD-TENG) for in vivo biomechanical energy harvesting, which can be
   degraded and resorbed in an animal body after completing its work cycle
   without any adverse long-term effects. Tunable electrical output
   capabilities and degradation features were achieved by fabricated
   BD-TENG using different materials. When applying BD-TENG to power two
   complementary micrograting electrodes, a DC-pulsed electrical field was
   generated, and the nerve cell growth was successfully orientated,
   showing its feasibility for neuron-repairing process. Our work
   demonstrates the potential of BD-TENG as a power source for transient

Title = {{Lateral Gene Transfer in a Heavy Metal-Contaminated-Groundwater
   Microbial Community}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Unraveling the drivers controlling the response and adaptation of
   biological communities to environmental change, especially anthropogenic
   activities, is a central but poorly understood issue in ecology and
   evolution. Comparative genomics studies suggest that lateral gene
   transfer (LGT) is a major force driving microbial genome evolution, but
   its role in the evolution of microbial communities remains elusive. To
   delineate the importance of LGT in mediating the response of a
   groundwater microbial community to heavy metal contamination,
   representative Rhodanobacter reference genomes were sequenced and
   compared to shotgun metagenome sequences. 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon
   sequence analysis indicated that Rhodanobacter populations were highly
   abundant in contaminated wells with low pHs and high levels of nitrate
   and heavy metals but remained rare in the uncontaminated wells. Sequence
   comparisons revealed that multiple geochemically important genes,
   including genes encoding Fe2+/Pb2+ permeases, most denitrification
   enzymes, and cytochrome c(553), were native to Rhodanobacter and not
   subjected to LGT. In contrast, the Rhodanobacter pangenome contained a
   recombinational hot spot in which numerous metal resistance genes were
   subjected to LGT and/or duplication. In particular, Co2+/Zn2+/Cd2+
   efflux and mercuric resistance operon genes appeared to be highly mobile
   within Rhodanobacter populations. Evidence of multiple duplications of a
   mercuric resistance operon common to most Rhodanobacter strains was also
   observed. Collectively, our analyses indicated the importance of LGT
   during the evolution of groundwater microbial communities in response to
   heavy metal contamination, and a conceptual model was developed to
   display such adaptive evolutionary processes for explaining the extreme
   dominance of Rhodanobacter populations in the contaminated groundwater
   microbiome.
   IMPORTANCE Lateral gene transfer (LGT), along with positive selection
   and gene duplication, are the three main mechanisms that drive adaptive
   evolution of microbial genomes and communities, but their relative
   importance is unclear. Some recent studies suggested that LGT is a major
   adaptive mechanism for microbial populations in response to changing
   environments, and hence, it could also be critical in shaping microbial
   community structure. However, direct evidence of LGT and its rates in
   extant natural microbial communities in response to changing
   environments is still lacking. Our results presented in this study
   provide explicit evidence that LGT played a crucial role in driving the
   evolution of a groundwater microbial community in response to extreme
   heavy metal contamination. It appears that acquisition of genes critical
   for survival, growth, and reproduction via LGT is the most rapid and
   effective way to enable microorganisms and associated microbial
   communities to quickly adapt to abrupt harsh environmental stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a pre-treatment technique that involves the partial
   pyrolysis (200-300 A degrees C) of biomass in an inert environment to
   improve its fuel properties. Effect of co-firing CO2-torrefied mesquite
   and juniper (10 \% on mass basis) with coal in a 30-kWt downfired burner
   was studied considering the grindability potential of CO2-torrefied
   biomass (60 \% higher grindability than N-2-torrefied biomass). It was
   observed that co-firing 10 \% by mass of raw mesquite with coal reduced
   the NO (x) emission from 420 to 280 ppm (33 \% reduction) for an
   equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.9. However, co-firing TB with coal reduced
   the NO (x) emission by 10 \% when compared to base case NO (x) emission
   from combustion of pure powder river basin coal (PRB) coal. Carbon
   monoxide percentage in the flue gas increased when biomass was co-fired
   with coal. An inverse relation was observed between CO and NO (x)
   emissions due to NO (x) reducing potential of CO in the presence of
   fixed carbon. Combining the advantages of using a greenhouse gas CO2 for
   pre-treatment and potential of CO2-torrefied biomass in reducing
   emissions with improved grindability, proves co-firing torrefied biomass
   with coal is an efficient technique.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive understanding of thermomechanical response and

   studied and modelled using the visco-plastic self-consistent framework.
   In situ high-speed imaging and digital image correlation of surface
   deformation in circular indentation were employed to elucidate mechanics
   occurring in a unit process deformation and to calibrate texture model
   parameters. Material response during directional surface mechanical
   attrition was simulated using a finite-element model coupled with the
   calibrated texture model. The crystallographic textures developed during
   S2PD were observed to be similar to those resultant from uniaxial
   compression. The implications of these results towards facilitating a

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cells transition from spread to rounded morphologies in diverse
   physiological contexts including mitosis and mesenchymal-to-amoeboid
   transitions. When these drastic shape changes occur rapidly, cell volume
   and surface area are approximately conserved. Consequently, the rounded
   cells are suddenly presented with a several-fold excess of cell surface
   whose area far exceeds that of a smooth sphere enclosing the cell
   volume. This excess is stored in a population of bleb-like protrusions
   (BLiPs), whose size distribution is shown by electron micrographs to be
   skewed. We introduce three complementary models of rounded cell
   morphologies with a prescribed excess surface area. A 2D Hamiltonian
   model provides a mechanistic description of how discrete attachment
   points between the cell surface and cortex together with surface bending
   energy can generate a morphology that satisfies a prescribed excess area
   and BLiP number density. A 3D random seed-and-growth model simulates
   efficient packing of BLiPs over a primary rounded shape, demonstrating a
   pathway for skewed BLiP size distributions that recapitulate 3D
   morphologies. Finally, a phase field model (2D and 3D) posits
   energy-based constitutive laws for the cell membrane, nematic F-actin
   cortex, interior cytosol, and external aqueous medium. The cell surface
   is equipped with a spontaneous curvature function, a proxy for the cell
   surface-cortex couple, that is a priori unknown, which the model
   ``learns{''} from the thin section transmission electron micrograph
   image (2D) or the ``seed and growth{''} model image (3D). Converged
   phase field simulations predict self-consistent amplitudes and spatial
   localization of pressure and stress throughout the cell for any posited
   stationary morphology target and cell compartment constitutive
   properties. The models form a general framework for future studies of
   cell morphological dynamics in a variety of biological contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Predictions of O-3, CO, total NOy and individual NOy species (NO, NO2,
   HNO3, PAN, alkyl nitrates and aerosol nitrate) from a fine resolution
   regional air quality modeling system for the South Coast Air Basin
   (SoCAB) and San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB) of California are
   presented and evaluated for the 2008 ARCTAS-CARB campaign. The
   measurements of the chemical compounds from the fire plumes during the
   field campaign allow for the evaluation of the model's ability to
   simulate fire-influenced air masses as well. In general, the model
   successfully simulated the broad spatial distribution of chemical
   compounds in both air basins as well as the variation within the basins.
   Using inventories that reflect 2008 emissions levels, the model
   performed well in simulating NOx (NO + NO2) in SoCAB. Therefore, the
   under prediction of O-3 over these areas is more likely caused by
   uncertainties with the VOC emissions, chemistry, or discrepancies in the
   meteorology. The model did not capture the relatively high levels of
   O-3, and some reactive nitrogen species that were measured off shore of
   the SoCAB, indicating potential missing sources or the transport from on
   shore to off shore was not successfully captured. In SJVAB, the model
   had good performance in simulating different chemical compounds in the
   Fresno and Arvin areas. However, enhanced concentrations of O-3, NOx,
   HNO3 and PAN near dairy farms were significantly underestimated in the
   model. Negative biases also exist for O-3 and HNO3 near oil fields,
   suggesting larger uncertainties associated with these emission sources.
   While the model simulated the total NOy mixing ratios reasonably well,
   the prediction for partitioning between individual compounds showed
   larger uncertainties in the model simulation. Although the fire
   emissions inventory was updated to include the latest emissions
   estimates and speciation profiles, our model shows limited improvement
   in simulating the enhancement of O-3, CO, and PAN under fire impact as
   compared to a previous version of the modeling system. Further
   improvements in simulating fire emissions, especially the timing and the
   plume injection heights, are desired in order to better simulate the
   impact of fires. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of porosity to the traditionally used solid titanium metal
   implants has been suggested to more closely mimic the natural mechanical
   properties of bone and increase osseointegration in dental and
   orthopedic implants. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   cellular response to three-dimensional (3D) porous Ti-6Al-4V constructs
   fabricated by additive manufacturing using laser sintering with low
   porosity (LP), medium porosity (MP), and high porosity (HP) with low
   resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) based on a computed tomography
   scan of human trabecular bone. After surface processing, construct
   porosity ranged from 41.0\% to 76.1\%, but all possessedmicro-/nanoscale
   surface roughness and similar surface chemistry containing mostly Ti, O,
   and C. Biological responses (osteoblast differentiation, maturation, and
   local factor production) by MG63 osteoblast-like cells and normal human
   osteoblasts favored 3D than two-dimensional (2D) solid constructs.
   First, MG63 cells were used to assess differences in cell response to 2D
   compared to LR and HR porous 3D constructs. MG63 cells were sensitive to
   porosity resolution and exhibited increased osteocalcin (OCN), vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) on HR 3D constructs than on 2D and LR 3D
   constructs. MG63 cells also exhibited porosity-dependent responses on HR
   constructs, with up to a 6.9-fold increase in factor production on LP-HR
   and MP-HR constructs than on HP-HR constructs. NHOsts were then used to
   validate biological response on HR constructs. NHOsts exhibited
   decreased DNA content and alkaline phosphatase activity and up to a
   2.9-fold increase in OCN, OPG, VEGF, BMP2, and BMP4 on 3D HR constructs
   than on 2D controls. These results indicate that osteoblasts prefer a 3D
   architecture than a 2D surface and that osteoblasts are sensitive to the
   resolution of trabecular detail and porosity parameters of
   laser-sintered 3D Ti-6Al-4V constructs.}},

   communication networking}},
Journal = {{NANO COMMUNICATION NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{17-26}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The prospect of new biological and industrial applications that require
   communication in micro-scale, encourages research on the design of
   bio-compatible communication networks using networking primitives
   already available in nature. One of the most promising candidates for
   constructing such networks is to adapt and engineer specific types of
   bacteria that are capable of sensing, actuation, and above all,
   communication with each other. In this paper, we present networking of
   bacteria colonies via molecular communication in a diffusion channel.
   The node in the network itself is a population of bacteria; as an
   individual bacterium (biological agent) is a tiny unreliable element
   with limited capabilities. Each single bacterium in the population
   senses a parameter of interest (e.g., a chemical) and reacts
   accordingly. The overall response of the bacteria population in a node
   is transferred to the next node in the network and sensed by its
   bacteria. We model the transmission and reception process of each
   individual bacteria through which we obtain the overall functionality of
   a node. Two scenarios are discussed as examples. Specifically, we will
   consider a line network formed by these nodes. We will study transfer of
   information and also present some results on the practical signaling,
   reliability, and latency in such a multihop line network. Wewill also
   study the consensus problem in a uniformly distributed network and show
   how the nodes can reach a common estimate for a particular parameter in
   the environment. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We study price and lead time quotation decisions in a make-to-order
   system with two customer classes: (1) contract customers whose orders
   are practically always accepted and fulfilled based on a contract price
   and lead time agreed on at the beginning of the time horizon, and (2)
   spot purchasers who arrive over time and are quoted a price and lead
   time pair dynamically. The objective is to maximize the long-run
   expected average profit per unit time, where profit from a customer is
   defined as revenues minus lateness penalties incurred because of lead
   time violations. We model the dynamic quotation problem of the spot
   purchasers as an infinite horizon Markov decision process, given a fixed
   price and lead time for contract customers. We analyze the impact of
   customer preferences (e.g., price and lead time sensitivity) on the
   optimal price and lead time decisions for spot purchasers and
   characterize the optimal policy. We explore the benefits of dynamic
   quotation compared to the use of fixed price and lead times, and provide
   recommendations for firms. Finally, we analyze the optimal contract
   terms given the dynamic quotation strategy for spot purchasers and
   discuss the profit improvements offered by the optimal mix of spot and
   contract customers.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic fragility analysis was performed for API X65, a type of buried
   gas pipeline that is widely used in Korea. For this purpose, nonlinear
   time-history analyses were carried out using 15 different analytical
   models of the pipeline, which represent variations of modeling
   parameters. The nonlinear Winkler approach was adopted to simulate the
   soil-pipeline interaction during an earthquake loading. A set of 12
   recorded ground motions were selected for the time-history analyses and
   scaled to represent a range of earthquake intensity levels. Then,
   fragility functions were developed with respect to the damage states,
   which are defined in terms of the maximum axial strain of the pipeline.
   The parameters under consideration for subsequent seismic fragility
   analyses are the soil conditions, boundary conditions, burial depth, and
   type of pipeline. Comparative analyses revealed that the first three
   parameters, most notably the soil conditions, influence the fragility
   curves, but the last parameter negligibly affects the fragility curves.
   It is concluded in short that this study is promising to give a useful
   insight for a rapid seismic performance evaluation of a buried gas
   pipeline based on nonlinear and fragility analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The axial gap between blade rows in turbomachinery should be minimized
   in order to reduce size requirements and increase efficiency; although,
   there is a tradeoff between gap width and flow steadiness. The
   aerodynamic interaction between rotors and stators influences system
   performance under both steady and transient conditions. To investigate
   the basic physical mechanisms associated with the rotor/stator
   interaction, an efficient numerical scheme for solving unsteady, viscous
   flows on a quasi-three-dimensional coordinate system is established
   using an immersed boundary method. The data transfer between moving and
   stationary grids that slip against each other in traditional numerical
   methods is avoided. The effects of the axial gap between adjacent blade
   rows are studied by considering the flow evolution through a rotor and
   stator stage in different Reynolds number regimes. Results indicate that
   reduced blade gap leads to high lift on the rotor blade and improved
   stage loading. At the same time, the rotor/stator interaction increases
   flow unsteadiness, which may in turn increase noise and vibration. It is
   found that the reduced blade gap does not always improve performance, in
   spite of the generation of vortex lift. The present work provides
   guidelines for optimization of the axial gap between blade rows for
   turbomachinery design.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional aerodynamic theory of lift is based on the Kutta-Joukowski
   condition, in which the lift and drag coefficients are predicted based
   on the assumption that flow is attached and steady-state. Recent
   research on insect flight indicates, however, that the unsteady motion
   of a wing can generate much higher unsteady aerodynamic force through
   the flow induced by the shedding vortices. In the present work,
   therefore, we propose a novel type of stage consisting of rotor and
   periodically pitched stator to take advantage of unsteady vortex lift.
   The numerical results suggest that the flowfield around the leading and
   trailing edges of the blades are substantially modified by the
   interactions between the rotor and pitching stator. Several transient
   lift peaks can be generated for each period. If an appropriate pitching
   phase is chosen for the stator, stage performance can be improved
   through unsteady lift mechanism effects.}},

Abstract = {{At the intersection of life sciences, materials science, engineering,
   and medicine, regenerative medicine stands out as a rapidly progressing
   field that aims at retaining, restoring, or augmenting tissue/organ
   functions to promote the human welfare. While the field has witnessed
   tremendous advancements over the past few decades, it still faces many
   challenges. For example, it has been difficult to visualize, monitor,
   and assess the functions of the engineered tissue/organ constructs,
   particularly when three-dimensional scaffolds are involved. Conventional
   approaches based on histology are invasive and therefore only convey
   end-point assays. The development of volumetric imaging techniques such
   as confocal and ultrasonic imaging has enabled direct observation of
   intact constructs without the need of sectioning. However, the
   capability of these techniques is often limited in terms of penetration
   depth and contrast. In comparison, the recently developed photoacoustic
   microscopy (PAM) has allowed us to address these issues by integrating
   optical and ultrasonic imaging to greatly reduce the effect of tissue
   scattering of photons with one-way ultrasound detection while retaining
   the high optical absorption contrast. PAM has been successfully applied
   to a number of studies, such as observation of cell distribution,
   monitoring of vascularization, and interrogation of biomaterial
   degradation. In this review article, we highlight recent progress in
   non-invasive and volumetric characterization of biomaterial-tissue
   interactions using PAM. We also discuss challenges ahead and envision
   future directions.}},

Abstract = {{The past three decades have seen numerous advances in tissue engineering
   and regenerative medicine (TERM) therapies. However, despite the
   successes there is still much to be done before TERM therapies become
   commonplace in clinic. One of the main obstacles is the lack of
   knowledge regarding complex tissue engineering processes. Imaging
   strategies, in conjunction with exogenous contrast agents, can aid in
   this endeavor by assessing in vivo therapeutic progress. The ability to
   uncover real-time treatment progress will help shed light on the complex
   tissue engineering processes and lead to development of improved,
   adaptive treatments. More importantly, the utilized exogenous contrast
   agents can double as therapeutic agents. Proper use of these
   Monitoring/Imaging and Regenerative Agents (MIRAs) can help increase
   TERM therapy successes and allow for clinical translation. While other
   fields have exploited similar particles for combining diagnostics and
   therapy, MIRA research is still in its beginning stages with much of the
   current research being focused on imaging or therapeutic applications,
   separately. Advancing MIRA research will have numerous impacts on
   achieving clinical translations of TERM therapies. Therefore, it is our
   goal to highlight current MIRA progress and suggest future research that
   can lead to effective TERM treatments.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of defect-assisted and intrinsic water vapor
   permeation through ultrabarrier films}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the development of ultrabarrier films for packaging electronics, the
   effective water vapor transmission rate is a combination of permeation
   through pinhole defects and the intrinsic permeation through the actual
   barrier film. While it is possible to measure the effective permeation
   rate through barriers, it is important to develop a better understanding
   of the contribution from defects to the overall effective barrier
   performance. Here, we demonstrate a method to investigate independently
   defect-assisted permeation and intrinsic permeation rates by observing
   the degradation of a calcium layer encapsulated with a hybrid barrier
   film, that is, prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and plasma
   enhanced deposition (PECVD). The results are rationalized using an
   analytical diffusion model to calculate the permeation rate as a
   function of spatial position within the barrier. It was observed that a
   barrier film consisting of a PECVD SiNx layer combined with an ALD
   Al2O3/HfOx nanolaminate resulted in a defect-assisted water vapor
   transmission rate (WVTR) of 4.84 x 10(-5) g/m(2) day and intrinsic WVTR
   of 1.41 x 10(-4) g/m(2) day at 50 degrees C/85\% RH. Due to the low
   defect density of the tested barrier film, the defect-assisted WVTR was
   found to be three times lower than the intrinsic WVTR, and an effective
   (or total) WVTR value was 1.89 x 10(-4) g/m(2) day. Thus, improvements
   of the barrier performance should focus on reducing the number of
   defects while also improving the intrinsic barrier performance of the
   hybrid layer. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a facile synthesis of radiolabeled PdCu@Au
   core-shell tripods for use in positron emission tomography (PET) and
   image-guided photothermal cancer treatment by directly incorporating
   radioactive Cu-64 atoms into the crystal lattice. The tripod had a
   unique morphology determined by the PdCu tripod that served as a
   template for the coating of Au shell, in addition to well-controlled
   specific activity and physical dimensions. The Au shell provided the
   nanostructure with strong absorption in the near-infrared region and
   effectively prevented the Cu and Cu-64 atoms in the, core from
   oxidization and dissolution. When conjugated with D-Ala(1)-peptide
   T-amide (DAPTA), the core shell tripods showed great enhancement in
   targeting the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCRS), a newly identified
   theranostic target up-regulated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   Specifically, the CCRS-targeted tripods with an arm length of about 45
   nm showed 2- and 6-fold increase in tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle
   uptake ratios, respectively, relative to their nontargeted counterpart
   in an orthotopic mouse 4T1 TNBC model at 24 h postinjection. The
   targeting specificity was further validated via a competitive receptor
   blocking study. We also demonstrated the use of these targeted,
   radioactive tripods for effective photothermal treatment in the 4T1
   tumor model as guided by PET imaging. The efficacy of treatment was
   confirmed by the significant reduction in tumor metabolic activity
   revealed through the use of P-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT imaging.
   Taken together, we believe that the Cu-64-doped PdCu@Au tripods could
   serve as a multifunctional platform for both PET imaging and
   image-guided photothermal cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The troponin complex, composed of troponin T (TnT), troponin I (TnI),
   and troponin C (TnC), is the major calcium-dependent regulator of muscle
   contraction, which is present widely in both vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Little is known about evolutionary aspects of troponin in
   the animal kingdom. Using a combination of data mining and functional
   analysis of TnI, we report evidence that an N-terminal extension of TnI
   is present in most of bilaterian animals as a functionally important
   domain. Troponin components have been reported in species in most of
   representative bilaterian phyla. Comparison of TnI sequences shows that
   the core domains are conserved in all examined TnIs, and that N- and
   C-terminal extensions are variable among isoforms and species. In
   particular, N-terminal extensions are present in all protostome TnIs and
   chordate cardiac TnIs but lost in a subset of chordate TnIs including
   vertebrate skeletal-muscle isoforms. Transgenic rescue experiments in
   Caenorhabditis elegans striated muscle show that the N-terminal
   extension of TnI (UNC-27) is required for coordinated worm locomotion
   but not in sarcomere assembly and single muscle-contractility kinetics.
   These results suggest that N-terminal extensions of TnIs are retained
   from a TnI ancestor as a functional domain. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in molecular communication among bio agents, the
   design of reliable communication schemes remains an open problem. One of
   the requirements is to develop suitable coding schemes, which meet the
   molecular communication specific constraints in terms of reliability and
   complexity, and take into account the communication channel properties.
   In this paper, we consider diffusion-based molecular communication in
   which the information is encoded into the concentration (e.g., on/off
   keying). Such a communication system is modeled as operating over a
   completely asymmetric channel where one of the bits can be transmitted
   without any error while the other can undergo a random error by the
   channel. Because of the limitations of bio-agents, we focus on
   error-detection schemes, which require far less complexity at the
   receiver relative to error-correction codes. To obtain an optimal
   detection scheme, we model the detection problem via an erasure channel
   and propose algorithms to obtain the optimal codewords efficiently for
   two different optimality measures. Then, we consider an error-free
   subfamily of such codes, namely constant weight codes, and propose an
   implementation specific to the molecular communication. We analyze the
   rate of the constant-weight coding scheme, compare it to the theoretical
   limits and specify the optimal weights and lengths of such codes.}},

Abstract = {{D2D communications has attracted substantial research attention recently

   The objective is to maximize various sum performance metrics (reward) of
   all D2D links and CUEs after successful pairing under individual power
   constraints. In our approach, a set of DUE candidates for each CUE
   uplink for a requisite SINR level is first identified, which allows us
   to form a bi-partite graph linking CUEs with their candidate DUE links
   for spectrum sharing. Classic algorithms, such as the Hopcroft-Karp,
   Gale-Shapley, and Kuhn-Munkres algorithms, are investigated for
   maximizing different performance metrics (reward) of all spectrum
   sharing CUEs and D2D links. Their performance is compared tp a
   low-complexity fairness-based algorithm that can deliver solid sum rate
   performance without high complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a decentralized energy management system for the
   coordinated operation of networked microgirds (MGs) in a distribution
   system. In the grid-connected mode, the distribution network operator
   and each MG are considered as distinct entities with individual
   objectives to minimize their own operation costs. It is assumed that
   both dispatchable and renewable energy source-based distributed
   generators (DGs) exist in the distribution network and the networked
   MGs. In order to coordinate the operation of all entities, we apply a
   decentralized bi-level algorithm to solve the problem with the first
   level to conduct negotiations among all entities and the second level to
   update the non-converging penalties. In the islanded mode, the objective
   of each MG is to maintain a reliable power supply to its customers. In
   order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load
   consumption, we formulate the problems as two-stage stochastic programs.
   The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the
   forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based
   on the realized scenarios. Case studies of a distribution system with
   networked MGs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology
   in both grid-connected and islanded modes.}},

Title = {{The Second Harmonic Generation in Reflection Mode: An Analytical,
   Numerical and Experimental Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The procedure to measure the second harmonic generation has typically
   been restricted to relatively simple setups such as through transmission
   of longitudinal waves or Rayleigh surface waves on one side of a
   component. Since these types of setups are not always applicable for
   in-service components, this research investigates the second harmonic
   wave generation in longitudinal and shear waves reflected from a
   stress-free surface. This particular measurement setup potentially
   provides information about the local damage state in an in-service
   component with only single-sided access. Therefore, this measurement
   setup is evaluated analytically, numerically and experimentally with an
   aluminum specimen as an example. The setup being considered proposes two
   possible measurement positions, where the second harmonic and the
   fundamental wave amplitude can be measured to determine the nonlinearity
   parameter of the specimen. This proposed ``reflection mode{''} setup is
   first analyzed analytically, and then is implemented in a commercial
   finite element code, using increasing fundamental wave amplitudes to
   calculate the different values of the nonlinearity parameters. The
   results of the simulations verify the analytical results, when taking
   into account assumptions and approximations of the analytical solution
   procedure. Furthermore, these numerical finite element results provide
   further insights into the intricacies of the setup, including the need
   to avoid interaction with the diffracted waves. On the basis of these
   numerical results, a recommendation for the measurement position and
   angle is given. Finally, the nonlinearity parameters of two similar
   specimens with different levels of nonlinearity are experimentally
   measured with the proposed measurement setup, and the results show the
   potential of the single-sided determination of a change in acoustic
   nonlinearity using reflected bulk waves.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell-based therapies hold great promise as a clinically viable
   approach for vascular regeneration. Preclinical studies have been very
   encouraging and early clinical trials have suggested favourable
   outcomes. However, significant challenges remain in terms of optimizing
   cell retention and maintenance of the paracrine effects of implanted
   cells. To address these issues, we have proposed the use of a cellular
   encapsulation approach to enhance vascular regeneration. We contained
   human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in biocompatible alginate
   microcapsules for therapeutic treatment in the setting of murine
   hindlimb ischaemia. This approach supported the paracrine pro-angiogenic
   activity of hMSCs, prevented incorporation of hMSCs into the host tissue
   and markedly enhanced their therapeutic effect. While injection of
   non-encapsulated hMSCs resulted in a 22 +/- 10\% increase in vascular
   density and no increase in perfusion, treatment with encapsulated hMSCs
   resulted in a 70 +/- 8\% increase in vascular density and 21 +/- 7\%
   increase in perfusion. The described cellular encapsulation strategy may
   help to better define the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial
   effects of cell-based therapies and provide a therapeutic strategy for
   inducing vascular growth in the adult. As hMSCs are relatively easy to
   isolate from patients, and alginate is biocompatible and already used in
   clinical applications, therapeutic cell encapsulation for vascular
   repair represents a highly translatable platform for cell-based therapy
   in humans. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{An Implicit Correlation Method for COMET Core Eigenvalue Uncertainty

Abstract = {{The coupled stochastic deterministic COarse MEsh radiation Transport
   (COMET) method requires a library of incident flux response expansion
   coefficients for its whole-core calculations. These coefficients are
   calculated using a stochastic method because of its high accuracy and
   robustness in modeling geometric complexity. However, the stochastic
   uncertainty inherent in response coefficients is unavoidably propagated
   into the whole-core calculations, and consequently, its effects must be
   quantitatively evaluated. The current method in COMET based on the error
   propagation significantly overpredicts uncertainty since the
   correlations among response coefficients are ignored. In this paper, a
   new adjoint-based method is developed to take into account the
   uncertainty and correlations of response coefficients. In this approach,
   forward calculations are first performed to obtain whole-core solutions
   such as the core eigenvalue and forward partial currents crossing mesh
   surfaces. Low-order adjoint calculations are then performed to determine
   the sensitivity of response coefficients. The core eigenvalue
   uncertainty is finally computed by taking into account the variances of
   surface-to-surface response coefficients, response fission production,
   and absorption rates as well as their correlations. The eigenvalue
   uncertainty predicated by the new method agrees very well with the
   reference solution, with a discrepancy <3 pcm, while the original error
   propagation method significantly overestimates the uncertainty. It is
   also found that the new method's computational efficiency is comparable
   to that of the current error propagation method in COMET since the
   computation time spent on the adjoint calculations is negligible. As an
   additional benefit, since the covariances among response coefficients
   are absorbed into the variance of the response net gain rates and the
   variance of the effective leakage terms, no extra computer memory is
   needed to store these covariances.}},

Abstract = {{Neonatal infections are the leading cause for neonatal deaths in
   developing countries, resulting in more than 1.5 million infant
   fatalities annually. The most effective prevention against neonatal
   infections is exclusive breastfeeding. However, reasons such as maternal
   death during birth, maternal illnesses such as HIV and TB-meningitis,
   and lack of rooming-in facilities prevent the infant to be breastfed by
   his/her mother. One way to mitigate these infections is by supplying
   pasteurized donor-expressed breastmilk. In this paper, we consider the
   network expansion of the donated breastmilk distribution supply chain in
   South Africa. As with the distribution of most public sector and
   humanitarian relief goods and services, the transportation of donated
   breastmilk is hampered by the inherent uncertainty in the environment,
   and by the fact that in addition to efficient usage of resources,
   distribution should be made in an equitable manner. We incorporate
   uncertainty into our models by means of multiple scenarios, which are
   determined based on different assumptions about population size, HIV
   prevalence, and status of public health in the country, income, and
   education. We consider various equity-based objectives and propose
   rounding-based heuristics to solve these. We focus on two delivery
   schemes; one which uses out-and back transportation, and one that makes
   multiple stops on the delivery route. Using computational experiments,
   we analyze the trade-offs between the objectives as well as the effects
   of various public health policies, network expansion budget, and
   assumptions on supply and demand. We also describe the teaching
   materials resulting from this paper, which include a case study, a
   supply/demand estimation tool, and an interactive decision support tool.

Abstract = {{As the use of and dependence on composite materials is increasing in all
   industries, there is a strong need for reliable, accurate, and fast
   techniques for damage detection and quantification in composite
   plate-like structures. Among the various nondestructive evaluation and
   structural health monitoring techniques, many rely on Lamb wave
   long-range propagation. A wavenumber quantification technique called
   frequency domain instantaneous wavenumber has been previously proven to
   be an efficient technique to estimate in-plane (i.e. position) and
   out-of-plane (i.e. depth) coordinates of defects in composites. This
   paper further develops this technique by (1) reducing the acquisition
   time by one order of magnitude while improving the quality of detection,
   (2) implementing an automatic feature extraction process to
   automatically assess the geometry and obtain information which can be
   directly used for decision making, and (3) quantifying the cumulative
   error of the whole process.}},

Abstract = {{Gas bubbles enhance contrast in ultrasound sonography and can also carry
   and deliver therapeutic agents. The mechanical properties of the bubble
   shell play a critical role in determining the physical response of gas
   bubbles under ultrasound insonation. Currently, few methods allow for
   tailoring of the mechanical properties of the stabilizing layers of gas
   bubbles. Here, we demonstrate that blending of poly(ethylene
   oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO)
   amphiphilic triblock copolymer with a recombinant protein, oleosin,
   enables the tuning of the mechanical properties of the bubble
   stabilizing layer. The areal expansion modulus of gas bubbles, as
   determined by micropipette aspiration, depends on the structure as well
   as the concentration of PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers. We believe our
   method of using a mixture of PEO-PPO-PEO and oleosin can potentially
   lead to the formation of microbubbles with stabilizing shells that can
   be functionalized and tailored for specific applications in ultrasound
   imaging and therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly employ the use of
   fluorescent thioflavin derivatives having affinity for the amyloid-beta
   (A beta) proteins associated with AD progression. However, thioflavin
   probes have limitations in their diagnostic capabilities arising from a
   number of undesireable qualities, including poor photostability, weak
   emission intensity, and high emission overlap with the backgound tissue
   autofluorescence. To overcome such limitations, we have developed
   nanoformulated probes consisting of a red-emitting fluorescent quantum
   dot (QD) core encapsulated in a PEGylated shell with benzotriazole (BTA)
   targeting molecules on the surface (QD-PEG-BTA). The combination of
   strong red fluorescence, multivalent binding, and decreased backgound
   signal and nonspecific binding provided the ability of the QD-PEG-BTA
   probes to achieve detection sensitivites 4 orders of magnitude greater
   than those of conventional thioflavin derivatives. This study opens the
   door for the use of QDs in AD detection applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a broadband mixed-signal CMOS power amplifier (PA)
   with a hybrid Class-G Doherty architecture for PA efficiency enhancement
   up to the deep power back-off (PBO) region. Our proposed mixed-signal
   linearization technique ensures the PA's amplitude modulation (AM)-AM
   linearity by digital PA operation and suppresses the PA's AM-phase
   modulation (PM) nonlinearity by real-time analog phase compensation. The
   PA is fully integrated in a standard 65 nm bulk CMOS process, and
   achieves a peak output power (P-out) of +26.7 dBm with a 40.2\% peak
   drain efficiency (DE) at 3.71 GHz. The DE at 6 and 12 dB PBO is 1.8x and
   2.6x over the reference Class-B PA operation, advancing the
   state-of-the-art CMOS PA PBO efficiency performance. The PA 1 dB
   bandwidth is extended from 1.08 to 1.8 GHz by reconfiguring the phase
   difference between the main and auxiliary paths in the Doherty PA. In
   the modulation measurements with 1 MSym/s 16 QAM signals, the PA
   performs dynamic hybrid Class-G Doherty operation and achieves +20.8 dBm
   peak P-out with 28.8\% DE at 3.71 GHz and 2.42x efficiency enhancement
   at 8.1 dB PBO over Class-B operation. The real-time AM-PM linearization
   technique achieves 3.3 and 2.9 dB improvements on the EVM and adjacent
   channel leakage ratio (ACLR), respectively. The broadband Class-G
   Doherty operation is also demonstrated with modulated signals.}},

Abstract = {{Glass substrates have outstanding electrical properties, tailorable
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high mechanical rigidity,
   availability in large and thin panel form, and smooth surface for fine
   line fabrication, and thus, have gained increased attention and interest
   in microelectronics industry since 2010. While thin glass packaging
   offers such a plethora of benefits, glass is a brittle material and thus
   is prone to failure when copper wiring and polymer layers are deposited
   on it. This experimental and theoretical work aims to understand the
   mechanics of glass cracking as a result of stress development from
   multilayer wiring, defect formation from panel dicing, and thermal
   cycling, then design a solution to prevent such cracks and demonstrate
   this solution. Dicing defects are simulated by adding a crack into the
   free edge of the glass and the energy available for crack propagation,
   G, is determined through a finite element based fracture mechanics
   approach. Moisture is well known to lower surface energy, resulting in a
   lower critical energy release rate for glass (GC) in the presence of
   moisture or water and, at the defect sizes measured, G reaches GC,
   indicating that the samples will crack while dicing in water. With
   thinner dielectric material, optimized dicing process, improved
   glass-polymer adhesion, and solder resist pullback, it is seen that
   glass cracking and glass-polymer delamination can be eliminated during
   dicing and subsequent thermal cycling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for segmenting the prostate on magnetic
   resonance (MR) images. A superpixel-based 3D graph cut algorithm is
   proposed to obtain the prostate surface. Instead of pixels, superpixels
   are considered as the basic processing units to construct a 3D
   superpixel-based graph. The superpixels are labeled as the prostate or
   background by minimizing an energy function using graph cut based on the
   3D superpixel-based graph. To construct the energy function, we proposed
   a superpixel-based shape data term, an appearance data term, and two
   superpixel-based smoothness terms. The proposed superpixel-based terms
   provide the effectiveness and robustness for the segmentation of the
   prostate. The segmentation result of graph cuts is used as an
   initialization of a 3D active contour model to overcome the drawback of
   the graph cut. The result of 3D active contour model is then used to
   update the shape model and appearance model of the graph cut. Iterations
   of the 3D graph cut and 3D active contour model have the ability to jump
   out of local minima and obtain a smooth prostate surface. On our 43 MR
   volumes, the proposed method yields a mean Dice ratio of 89.3 +/- 1.9\%.
   On PROMISE12 test data set, our method was ranked at the second place;
   the mean Dice ratio and standard deviation is 87.0 +/- 3.2\%. The
   experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several
   state-of-the-art prostate MRI segmentation methods.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the possibility to
   selectively tune the convective heat transfer coefficient in different
   sections of a heat sink by varying the density of microfeatures in order
   to minimize temperature gradients between discrete heat sources
   positioned along the flow path. Lifetime of power electronics is
   strongly correlated to the thermal management of the junction.
   Therefore, it is of interest to have constant junction temperatures
   across all devices in the array. Implementation of microfeature
   enhancement on the convective side improves the heat transfer due to an
   increase in surface area. Specific shapes such as micro-hydrofoils offer
   a reduced pressure drop allowing for combined improvement of heat
   transfer and flow performance. This study presents experimental results
   from an array of three discrete heat sources (20 x 15 mm) generating 100
   W/cm(2) and positioned in line along the flow path with a spacing of
   10mm between each of the sources. The heat sink was machined out of
   aluminum 6061, and micro-hydrofoils with a characteristic length of 500
   mu m were embedded in the cold plate. The cooling medium used is water
   at a flow rate of 3.6-13.4 g/s corresponding to a Reynolds number of
   420-1575. It is demonstrated that the baseplate temperature can be
   maintained below 90 degrees C, and the difference between the maximum
   temperatures of each heat source is less than 6.7 degrees C at a heat
   flux of 100 W/cm(2) and a water flow rate of 4.8 g/s.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in anion recognition is to design hosts that
   can be used to distinguish between anions of different shapes.
   Urea-based molecules are widely used in anion recognition because the
   pair of-NH groups acts as an electron acceptor. Although these hosts can
   bind to both spherical anions (halides) and Y-shaped anions (oxoanions),
   experimental evidence to date does not provide a clear picture of what
   differences in the nature of the hydrogen bonding interactions could be
   used to distinguish between anions of different shapes. Here, we use
   several computational topology analyses to study the non covalent
   interactions between Cr(CO)(3)-based organometallic urea-like hosts and
   halides and Y-shaped oxoanions. Our results suggest that the F- and AcO-
   anions are recognized experimentally due to a combination of strong
   interaction and large infrared (IR) shifts upon complexation, verifying
   the remarkable IR-reporting ability of the Cr(CO)(3) moiety and its
   potential applications in anion recognition. The lone pairs of the
   oxygen atom in Y-shaped oxoanions directly interact with the -NH groups
   of the hosts, while all the shell electrons of the halides participate
   as a group in the interaction; however, the relative contributions of
   electrostatic and charge-transfer interactions are quite similar for the
   two types of anions. This insight into the nature of the anion-host
   interactions can be used to provide guidance for the design of hosts
   that differentiate between anions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   System (IS) tool used for the successful completion of construction
   projects and the achievement of organizational goals. This study
   investigated the effects of computer self-efficacy and IS quality

   PMIS. The study used the updated DeLone and McLean Information System
   Success Model (D\&M ISSM) as a theoretical foundation. The proposed
   model was tested empirically by using survey data collected from 379
   construction professionals. The empirical results suggest that
   construction professionals' perceived benefits are determined by
   behavioral intention to use and user satisfaction, and that these are in

Title = {{Automated medical resident rotation and shift scheduling to ensure

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{At academic teaching hospitals around the country, the majority of
   clinical care is provided by resident physicians. During their training,
   medical residents often rotate through various hospitals and/or medical
   services to maximize their education. Depending on the size of the
   training program, manually constructing such a rotation schedule can be
   cumbersome and time consuming. Further, rules governing allowable duty
   hours for residents have grown more restrictive in recent years (ACGME
   2011), making day-to-day shift scheduling of residents more difficult
   (Connors et al., J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 137:710-713, 2009; McCoy et
   al., May Clin Proc 86(3):192, 2011; Willis et al., J Surg Edu
   66(4):216-221, 2009). These rules limit lengths of duty periods,
   allowable duty hours in a week, and rest periods, to name a few. In this
   paper, we present two integer programming models (IPs) with the goals of
   (1) creating feasible assignments of residents to rotations over a
   one-year period, and (2) constructing night and weekend call-shift
   schedules for the individual rotations. These models capture various
   duty-hour rules and constraints, provide the ability to test multiple
   what-if scenarios, and largely automate the process of schedule
   generation, solving these scheduling problems more effectively and
   efficiently compared to manual methods. Applying our models on data from
   a surgical residency program, we highlight the infeasibilities created
   by increased duty-hour restrictions placed on residents in conjunction
   with current scheduling paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of wind power has led to an increased demand for
   spinning reserve in power systems today. However, one of the most severe
   challenges to China's power systems is the mismatch between wind power
   installation capacity and the capability for supplying spinning reserve
   within each independently operated provincial power system. Coordinating
   the spinning reserve across multiple areas would providentially improve
   the accommodation of wind power. This paper proposes a game-theoretical
   model for spinning reserve trading between provincial systems that treat
   spinning reserve as a commodity. Based on the incomplete information,
   the trading price is calculated by satisfying the Bayesian Nash
   equilibrium, and then the trading quantity is determined. This ensures
   that both the buyer and the seller are able to maximize their expected
   profit. Case studies are performed using a 2-bus interconnected system
   and a 3-area IEEE RTS system. The results show that the proposed model
   is valid and effective.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency inter-area oscillation is a potentially dangerous
   phenomenon in power systems involving exchange of power among generators
   in different areas. In this paper, we study the characteristics of
   inter-area oscillation by analyzing the distribution of the oscillation
   energy. First, we introduce equations for the kinetic energy of
   generators and the potential energy of network branches, derived from
   the linearization of system dynamic equations. Then, we study the mode
   composition and the distribution of the generators' kinetic energy
   during low-frequency oscillations. A modal kinetic energy participation
   factor is proposed for evaluating the participation of each generator in
   the oscillation. The relationships among electromagnetic power
   oscillation distribution, rotor speed deviation, and generator kinetic
   energy are analyzed and compared to their modal parameter left
   eigenvectors, right eigenvectors, and linear participation factors,
   respectively. The bus voltage angle deviation, active power oscillation,
   and branch potential energy are calculated using the right eigenvector
   from modal analysis. The distribution characteristics of voltage angle
   oscillation and branch potential energy in inter-area oscillation is
   developed. The simulation results for a four-generator two-area system
   and the New England 10-machine 39-bus system illustrate the feasibility
   and validity of the proposed theory and method for analysis of
   inter-area oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to synthesizing monodisperse Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) nanospheres is
   the key to reducing the irreversible capacity of LTO materials, and thus
   improving their power performance. However, it remains a grand challenge
   to achieve uniform precursors of LTO nanospheres and maintain their
   spherical structures after annealing. Herein, we develop a robust
   strategy for the synthesis of monodisperse LTO nanospheres with an
   average diameter of 120 nm via the use of titanium nitride (TiN) as a
   titanium source for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The precursors
   composed of uniform TiO2/Li+ nanospheres were formed in a stable
   alkaline environment during the course of heating of the solution of
   peroxo-titanium complex as a result of the dissolution of TiN, while
   TiO2/Li+ microspheres were easily yielded with the decrease in pH value
   of the precursor solution. The OH- anion was found to effectively retard
   the hydrolysis of peroxo-titanium complex as well as the aggregation of
   TiO2/Li+ nanoparticles. Intriguingly, a uniform polyvinyl pyrrolidone
   (PVP) layer formed in-situ on the surface of TiO2/Li+ nanospheres
   rendered LTO to retain the monodisperse spherical morphology after
   annealing. Notably, the as prepared monodisperse LTO nanospheres
   comprised of the interconnected LTO nanograins with an average size of
   similar to 15 nm uniformly coated by a carbon layer derived from the
   carbonization of PVP exhibited a high tap density (1.1 g cm(-3)) and an
   outstanding rate-cycling capability. The charge specific capacities at
   1, 10, 50 and 80 C were 159.5, 151.1, 128.8 and 108.9 mAh g(-1),
   respectively. More importantly, the capacity retention after 500 cycles
   at 10 C was as high as 92.6\%. This work opens up an avenue to craft the
   uniform precursors of LTO and thus monodisperse LTO nanospheres that
   possess superior rate performance with high volumetric energy densities
   and long-term cyclic stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Amorphous fish-scale-like FeOOH and flower-like Co-Ni double hydroxides
   (Co-Ni-DH) have been synthesized through one-step electrodeposition. The
   unique nanostructures of the hydroxides provide a large number of
   surface active sites, while the amorphous nature of the material systems
   facilitates the diffusion and reaction of electrolyte ions and enables
   an isotropic charging/discharging process. Because of these advantages,
   the FeOOH and Co-Ni-DH electrodes exhibit high pseudocapacitances of
   1.11 F cm(-2)/867 F g(-1) and 1.48 F cm(-2)/1201 F g(-1), respectively.
   In addition, high rate capabilities and superior cyclabilities are
   achieved. By using the FeOOH and Co-Ni-DH as the anode and cathode,
   respectively, we have assembled an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor
   that delivers a high energy density of 86.4 W h kg(-1)/0.723 mW h cm(-3)
   and a high power density of 11.6 kW kg(-1)/0.973 mW cm(-3). Moreover,
   the fabrication process presented in this work is facile, scalable,
   cost-effective, and environmentally benign, offering a feasible solution
   for manufacturing next-generation high-performance energy storage
   devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{276-294}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, chemical compounds of graphene oxide (GO) and amine
   molecules as spacers were synthesized by one-step hydrothermal
   reactions. The products of the reactions, referred to as rGO-Spacers
   samples, were fabricated into electrodes for supercapacitors. By
   engineering the molecular structures of the spacers, the specific
   capacitance (C-s) of the rGO-Spacers can reach up to 612 F/g at 2 mV/s
   in cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, 597 F/g at 0.5 A/g and 512 F/g
   at 10 A/g in galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement using
   two-electrode setup with 1 M sulfuric acid aqueous solution at the
   electrolyte. 97\% of the high C-s was retained after 10 000
   charge-discharge cycles. In comparison, the control sample without
   spacers presents a C-s of 194 F/g measured in CV measurement under the
   same conditions. The increased interlayer distance up to 1.9 nm between
   graphene sheets caused by addition of the amine spacers was confirmed by
   X-ray diffraction. The morphology of rGO-Spacers samples was
   characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron
   microscope and atomic force microscope, where crumpled thin sheets were
   observed. The spacer molecules were found to disperse uniformly on the
   sheets by energy dispersive spectroscope mapping. Chemical reactions and
   covalent bonding between GO and the spacers are evidenced by
   thermogravimetric analysis, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscope and
   Raman spectroscopy.. Based on the characterization results, the amide
   formation reactions and epoxide ring opening reactions between amine
   spacers and GO are proposed. The weight measurement and the atomic ratio
   information from XPS further reveal different reactivity of the spacers
   to GO, which could account for the different C-s of the samples with
   spacers of different molecular structures. From the results of these
   comparative studies, the engineering of the molecular structures was
   found to play a pivotal role in determining the value of C-s. The
   findings also provide guidance to achieve even higher C-s by
   optimization of the molecular structures of the spacers, as well as
   other experimental parameters which can facilitate the reaction between
   the spacers and GO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of nanometre-sized structures that exhibit controllable
   motions and functions is a critical step towards building nanomachines.
   Recent developments in the field of DNA nanotechnology have begun to
   address these goals, demonstrating complex static or dynamic
   nanostructures made of DNA. Here we have designed and constructed a
   rhombus-shaped DNA origami `nanoactuator' that uses mechanical linkages
   to copy distance changes induced on one half ('the driver') to be
   propagated to the other half ('the mirror'). By combining this
   nanoactuator with split enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), we
   have constructed a DNA-protein hybrid nanostructure that demonstrates
   tunable fluorescent behaviours via long-range allosteric regulation. In
   addition, the nanoactuator can be used as a sensor that responds to
   specific stimuli, including changes in buffer composition and the
   presence of restriction enzymes or specific nucleic acids.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To sustainably power electronics by harvesting mechanical energy using
   nanogenerators, energy storage is essential to supply a regulated and
   stable electric output, which is traditionally realized by a direct
   connection between the two components through a rectifier. However, this
   may lead to low energy-storage efficiency. Here, we rationally design a
   charging cycle to maximize energy-storage efficiency by modulating the
   charge flow in the system, which is demonstrated on a triboelectric
   nanogenerator by adding a motion-triggered switch. Both theoretical and
   experimental comparisons show that the designed charging cycle can
   enhance the charging rate, improve the maximum energy-storage efficiency
   by up to 50\% and promote the saturation voltage by at least a factor of
   two. This represents a progress to effectively store the energy
   harvested by nanogenerators with the aim to utilize ambient mechanical
   energy to drive portable/wearable/implantable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{DNA strand displacement has been widely used for the design of molecular

   been shown that this technology can also operate in biological

   strand displacement and exchange reactions to mammalian cells and report
   DNA circuitry that can directly interact with a native mRNA. We began by
   optimizing the cellular performance of fluorescent reporters based on
   four-way strand exchange reactions and identified robust design
   principles by systematically varying the molecular structure, chemistry
   and delivery method. Next, we developed and tested AND and OR logic
   gates based on four-way strand exchange, demonstrating the feasibility
   of multi-input logic. Finally, we established that functional siRNA
   could be activated through strand exchange, and used native mRNA as
   programmable scaffolds for co-localizing gates and visualizing their
   operation with subcellular resolution.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The fully-reversed bending fatigue behavior of 20-mu m-thick
   electroplated Ni notched microbeams actuated at resonance (-8 kHz) was
   characterized in humid air environments, in an effort to investigate the
   effects of extreme stress gradients (normalized stress gradients of
   36\%/mu m over the first 2 mu m at the notch root) in small-scale
   fatigue. Compared to our previous study, larger driving forces (stress
   amplitudes up to 510 MPa (60\% of the ultimate tensile strength),
   corresponding to plastic strain amplitudes up to similar to 0.1\%) were
   applied, leading to the propagation of microstructurally small cracks
   ahead of the notch. The endurance limit reaches 50\% of the ultimate
   tensile strength, and the Basquin and Coffin-Manson fits for the stress
   and strain-life curves, respectively, exhibit much lower (in absolute
   value) fatigue exponents that typical values for bulk metals. This
   singular behavior is explained by the ultraslow and decelerating crack
   growth rates, calculated based on the measured resonance frequency
   evolution during the fatigue tests, which appear to characterize the
   growth of microstructurally small cracks under extreme stress gradients.
   This study highlights the need to further characterize the effects of
   different stress gradients values on crack growth rates and fatigue
   lives in order to accurately predict the small-scale fatigue damage in
   metallic microbeams. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Construction companies can accrue losses due to labor fatalities and
   injuries. Since more than 70\% of all accidents are related to human
   activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks hold the key to
   improving the safety conditions within the construction industry.
   Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional
   conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent
   observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that
   inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related
   accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are
   vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated
   construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental
   conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there
   are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of
   monitoring construction workers' mental conditions. The research
   proposed in this paper aims to develop a measurement approach to
   evaluate hazards through neural time-frequency analysis. The
   experimental results show that neural signals are valid for mental load
   assessment of construction workers, especially the low frequency bands
   signals. The research also describes the development of a prototype for
   a wearable electro-encephalography (EEG) safety helmet that enables the
   collection of the neural information required as input for the
   measurement approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) functionalized gold
   nanoparticles (AuNPs) to catalytically silence tumor necrosis

   myocardial infarction (MI). Using primary macrophages as a model, we
   demonstrated 50\% knockdown of TNF-a, which was not attainable using
   Lipofectamine-based approaches. Local injection of DNAzyme conjugated to
   gold particles (AuNPs) in the rat myocardium yielded TNF-alpha knockdown
   efficiencies of 50\%, which resulted in significant anti-inflammatory
   effects and improvement in acute cardiac function following MI. Our
   results represent the first example showing the use of DNAzyme AuNP
   conjugates in vivo for viable delivery and gene regulation. This is
   significant as TNF-alpha is a multibillion dollar drug target implicated
   in many inflammatory-mediated disorders, thus underscoring the potential
   impact of DNAzyme-conjugated AuNPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   non-axisymmetry effects}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{188-197}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A key component of the thermoacoustic instability feedback mechanism is
   the excitation of hydrodynamic flow disturbances by narrowband acoustic
   fluctuations. In earlier work, we considered the response of time
   averaged axisymmetric flames to helical disturbances. That study showed
   that although all helical modes cause local flame wrinkling, only the
   axisymmetric hydrodynamic mode, m = 0, contributes to the global heat
   release rate fluctuations. This paper extends this work to consider
   time-averaged flames that are nonaxisymmetric. We show that distortions
   of the unforced flame shape changes its receptivity to helical
   disturbances, as it does not allow for the perfect destructive
   interference seen in axisymmetric flames. This results in a non-zero
   global flame response contribution from helical modes. Given that
   helical modes often have the largest amplitudes in jet flows,
   particularly those with swirl, these results show that the degree of
   non-axisymmetry of the flame has an important influence in determining
   which hydrodynamic modes, axisymmetric or helical, control the global
   heat release response of the flame. These points have been illustrated
   with example calculations that show how different control parameters and
   the degree of time-averaged nonaxisymmetry influence the global flame
   response. An important implication of these results relates to scaling
   results from simplified geometries where a round jet is placed inside a
   round enclosure, to more realistic ones (such as where multiple jets are
   placed next to each other) where the flame shape will be distorted from
   being perfectly circular. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published

Abstract = {{Explaining the presence of conspicuous female ornaments that take the
   form of male-typical traits has been a longstanding challenge in
   evolutionary biology. Such female ornaments have been proposed to evolve
   via both adaptive and nonadaptive evolutionary processes. Determining
   the genetic underpinnings of female ornaments is important for
   elucidating the mechanisms by which such female traits arise and persist
   in natural populations, but detailed information about their genetic
   basis is still scarce. In this study, we investigated the genetic
   architecture of two ornaments, the orange-red throat and pelvic spine,
   in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Throat
   coloration is male-specific in ancestral marine populations but has
   evolved in females in some derived stream populations, whereas sexual
   dimorphism in pelvic spine coloration is variable among populations. We
   find that ornaments share a common genetic architecture between the
   sexes. At least three independent genomic regions contribute to red
   throat coloration, and harbor candidate genes related to pigment
   production and pigment cell differentiation. One of these regions is
   also associated with spine coloration, indicating that both ornaments
   might be mediated partly via pleiotropic genetic mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Multiobjective Construction Schedule Optimization Using Modified Niched
   Pareto Genetic Algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A construction schedule must satisfy multiple project objectives that
   often conflict with each other. While several earlier approaches
   attempted to generate optimal schedules in terms of several criteria,
   most of their optimization processes were segmented into multiple steps.
   Owing to such a lack of simultaneous optimization, limited alternative
   solutions could be searched and some trade-offs between goals could not
   be identified. This paper presents an optimization approach that enables
   a simultaneous search for an optimal construction schedule in terms of
   three objectives: minimization of construction duration, cost, and
   resource fluctuation. A multiobjective optimization (MOO) approach was
   adopted to generate scheduling solutions considering all those
   objectives. To enable a simultaneous optimization, we propose a new data
   structure that can compute the performances of solutions in terms of all
   the objectives at the same time. A Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm
   (NPGA) is modified to facilitate the optimization procedure. Then the
   proposed optimization approach is implemented in an existing case study.
   The result indicates that the proposed approach has the capability to
   explore and generate a greater range of solutions compared to existing
   models. Trade-offs between all three objectives are identified,
   limitations and further research needs are discussed. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Highway Construction Cost Forecasting Using Vector Error Correction
   Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Highway construction costs are subject to significant variations over
   time. These fluctuations are apparent in trends of indices, such as the
   national highway construction cost index (NHCCI). These variations are
   problematic for highway contractors because they can result in bid loss
   or profit loss. They are also problematic for owner organizations, such
   as State Departments of Transportation (State DOTs), because they can
   result in hidden price contingencies, delayed or cancelled projects,
   inconsistency in budgets, and unsteady flow of projects. These problems
   can be prevented if highway construction costs are forecasted
   accurately. Existing literature lacks appropriate models to accurately
   forecast NHCCI. The objective of this research is to identify the
   leading indicators of NHCCI (i.e.,the explanatory variables of NHCCI
   that are useful to predict NHCCI), and create appropriate multivariate
   time series models for forecasting NHCCI through utilizing information
   available from the identified leading indicators. A pool of 16 candidate
   (potential) leading indicators of NHCCI, such as crude oil price, number
   of housing starts, and consumer price index is initially selected based
   on a comprehensive literature review. The leading indicators of NHCCI
   are identified from the pool of candidate leading indicators using
   statistical tests. Based on the unit root tests and Granger causality
   tests, crude oil price and average hourly earnings in the construction
   industry are found to be the leading indicators of NHCCI. Based on the
   results of cointegration tests, Vector Error Correction (VEC) models are
   created as proper multivariate time series models to forecast NHCCI. The
   results show that the VEC model including NHCCI and crude oil price pass
   diagnostic tests. The results also show that multivariate time series
   models are more accurate than univariate models for forecasting NHCCI in
   terms of out-of-sample mean absolute prediction error and out-of-sample
   mean square error. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge in
   NHCCI forecasting by rigorous identification of the leading indicators
   of NHCCI and creation of multivariate time series models that are more
   accurate than the univariate time series models for forecasting NHCCI.
   It is expected that the proposed forecasting models enhance the theory
   and practice of highway construction cost forecasting and help cost
   engineers and capital planners prepare more accurate bids, cost
   estimates, and budgets for highway projects. (C) 2015 American Society

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{710-719}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial pathogens trigger cell death by a variety of mechanisms,
   including injection of effector proteins. Effector proteins have great
   potential as anticancer agents because they efficiently subvert a
   variety of eukaryotic signaling pathways involved in cancer development,
   drug resistance, and metastasis. In breast cancer, MAPK and NF kappa 3
   pathways are known to be dysregulated. YopJ, an effector from Yersinia
   pestis, downregulates MAPK and NF kappa B pathways to induce cell death
   in specific cell types. We expressed YopJ in Escherichia coli as a
   fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), forming
   self-assembled protein nanoparticles with diameters of 100 nm. YopJ-GST
   nanoparticles efficiently delivered protein to cells, replacing the need
   for the pathogen secretion mechanism for effector delivery to cells.
   These nanoparticles induced dose and time dependent death in SKBR-3
   breast cancer cells. After 72 h, 97\% of cells died, significantly more
   than with the same molar dose of doxorubicin. Treatment with sublethal
   doses of nanoparticles decreased cell migration in vitro and
   downregulated the MAPK ERK 1/2 pathway, which has been correlated to
   metastasis. Exposure to a panel of breast cancer cell lines showed that
   YopJ-GST nanoparticles are cytotoxic to different subtypes, including
   doxorubicin resistant cells. However, they were not cytotoxic to NIH/3T3
   fibroblasts or HeLa cells. Thus, YopJ-GST nanoparticles demonstrate the
   potential of effector proteins as breast cancer therapeutics with
   selective cytotoxicity and the capacity to decrease metastatic
   predictive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have demonstrated that nanogenerators fabricated
   using two-dimensional MoS2 flakes may find potential applications in
   electromechanical sensing, wearable technology, pervasive computing, and
   implanted devices. In the present study, we theoretically examined the
   effect of the number of atomic layers in MoS2 flakes on the
   nanogenerator output. Under a square-wave applied strain, MoS2 flakes
   with an even number of atomic layers did not exhibit a piezoelectric
   output, owing to the presence of a projected inversion symmetry. On the
   other hand, for MoS2 flakes with an odd number of layers, owing to the
   lack of inversion symmetry, piezoelectric output voltage and current
   were generated, and decreased with the increase of the number of layers.
   Furthermore, as MoS2 flakes were only a few atoms thick, the capacitance
   of the MoS2 nanogenerators was at least an order of magnitude smaller
   than that of the nanowire- and nanofilm-based nanogenerators, enabling
   the use of MoS2 nanogenerators in high-frequency applications. Our
   results explain the experimental observations and provide guidance on
   optimizing and designing two-dimensional nanogenerators.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{278+}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing forces on deformable objects intruding into sand and soil
   requires understanding the solid- and fluid-like responses of such
   substrates and their effect on the state of the object. The most
   detailed studies of intrusion in dry granular media have revealed that
   interactions of fixed-shape objects during free impact (for example,
   cannonballs) and forced slow penetration can be described by
   hydrostatic- and hydrodynamic-like forces. Here we investigate a new
   class of granular interactions: rapid intrusions by objects that change
   shape (self-deform) through passive and active means. Systematic studies
   of a simple spring-mass robot jumping on dry granular media reveal that
   jumping performance is explained by an interplay of nonlinear frictional
   and hydrodynamic drag as well as induced added mass (unaccounted by
   traditional intrusion models) characterized by a rapidly solidified
   region of grains accelerated by the foot. A model incorporating these
   dynamics reveals that added mass degrades the performance of certain
   self-deformations owing to a shift in optimal timing during push-off.
   Our systematic robophysical experiment reveals both new soft-matter
   physics and principles for robotic self-deformation and control, which
   together provide principles of movement in deformable terrestrial
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(acrylonitrile-co-methacrylic acid)
   (PAN-co-MAA)/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solutions were prepared and
   dynamic shear rheology of these solutions were investigated. With
   increasing stirring time up to 72 h at 70 degrees C, the polymer
   solution became less elastic (more liquid-like) with a approximate to
   60\% reduction in the zero-shear viscosity. Relaxation spectra of the
   PAN-co-MAA/DMF solutions yield a decrease in relaxation time
   (disentanglement time, (d)), corresponding to an about 8\% decrease in
   viscosity average molecular weight. The log-log plot of G (storage
   modulus) versus G (loss modulus) exhibited an increase in slope as a
   function of stirring time, suggesting that the molecular level solution
   homogeneity increased. In order to study the effect of solution
   homogeneity on the resulting carbon fiber tensile strength, multiple
   PAN-co-MAA/DMF solutions were prepared, and the precursor fibers were
   processed using gel-spinning, followed by continuous stabilization and
   carbonization. The rheological properties of each solution were also
   measured and correlated with the tensile strength values of the carbon
   fibers. It was observed that with increasing the slope of the G versus G
   log-log plot from 1.471 to 1.552, and reducing interfilament fiber
   friction during precursor fiber drawing through the addition of a fiber
   washing step prior to fiber drawing, the carbon fiber strength was
   improved (from 3.7 to 5.8 GPa). This suggests that along with precursor
   fiber manufacturing and carbonization, the solution homogeneity is also
   very important to obtain high strength carbon fiber. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a new distributed adaptive iterative learning
   control (AILC) scheme for a class of high-order nonlinear multi-agent
   systems (MAS) under alignment condition with both parametric and

   and the control input gain functions are not fully known. Backstepping
   design with the composite energy function (CEF) structure is used in the
   discussion. Through rigorous analysis, we show that under this new AILC
   scheme, uniform convergence of agents output tracking error over the

Abstract = {{In our previous study, we produced phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) in one step
   from L-phenylalanine by using an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst
   expressing an L-amino acid deaminase (L-AAD) from Proteus mirabilis
   KCTC2566. However, the PPA titer was low due to the degradation of PPA
   and low substrate specificity of L-AAD. In this study, metabolic
   engineering of the L-phenylalanine degradation pathway in E. coli and
   protein engineering of L-AAD from P. mirabilis were performed to improve
   the PPA titer. First, three aminotransferase genes were knocked out to
   block PPA degradation, which increased the PPA titer from 3.3 +/- 0.2 to
   3.9 +/- 0.1 g/L and the substrate conversion ratio to 97.5 \%. Next,
   L-AAD was engineered via error-prone polymerase chain reaction, followed
   by site-saturation mutation to improve its catalytic performance. The
   triple mutant D165K/F263M/L336M produced the highest PPA titer of 10.0
   +/- 0.4 g/L, with a substrate conversion ratio of 100 \%, which was 3.0
   times that of wildtype L-AAD. Comparative kinetics analysis showed that
   compared with wild-type L-AAD, the triple mutant had higher
   substrate-binding affinity and catalytic efficiency. Finally, an optimal
   fed-batch biotransformation process was developed to achieve a maximal
   PPA titer of 21 +/- 1.8 g/L within 8 h. This study developed a robust
   whole-cell E. coli biocatalyst for PPA production by integrating
   metabolic and protein engineering, strategies that may be useful for the
   construction of other biotransformation biocatalysts.}},

   industrial applications. Microbial processes used in production of such
   sugars are not only carbon-intensive and energy-demanding processes but
   also have other distinct disadvantages such as low productivity, low

   has emerged as an effective tool for developing engineered strains to
   deliver production strategies for many valuable sugars, which were
   previously difficult to manufacture by other means, in necessary amounts
   to support their applications. In this review, the recent strategies
   used for metabolic engineering are summarized and future prospects of
   this technique are discussed. We hope that this review will contribute
   to the development of functional and high-value sugar production by

Abstract = {{As an important component of soil organic matter (SOM), the
   transformation of pyrogenic carbon plays a critical role in the
   biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other redox-active elements such as
   iron (Fe). Herein, we studied the influences of wheat straw-derived
   biochars on the microbial reduction of 100 mM of hematite by the
   dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under
   anoxic conditions. The long-term microbial reduction extent and initial
   reduction rate of hematite were accelerated by more than 2-fold in the
   presence of 10 mg L-1 biochar. Soluble leachate from 10 mg L-1 biochar
   enhanced Fe(III) reduction to a similar degree. Microbially prereduced
   biochar leachate abiotically reduced hematite, consistent with the
   apparent electron shuttling capacity of biochar leachate. Electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis suggested that biochar
   leachate-associated semiquinone functional groups were likely involved
   in the redox reactions. In addition to electron shuttling effects,
   biochar particles sorbed 0.5-1.5 mM biogenic Fe(II) and thereby
   increased the long-term extent of hematite reduction by 1.4-1.7 fold.
   Our results suggest that Fe redox cycling may be strongly impacted by
   pyrogenic carbon in soils with relatively high content of indigenous
   pyrogenic carbon or substantial application of biochar.}},

Abstract = {{Elimination of pharmaceuticals in source-separated human urine is a
   promising approach to minimize the pharmaceuticals in the environment.
   Although the degradation kinetics of pharmaceuticals by UV/H2O2 and
   UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) processes has been investigated in synthetic
   fresh and hydrolyzed urine, comprehensive evaluation of the advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs), such as product identification and toxicity
   testing, has not yet been performed. This study identified the
   transformation products of two commonly used antibiotics, trimethoprim
   (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), by UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS in synthetic
   urine matrices. The effects of reactive species, including (OH)-O-center
   dot, SO4 center dot-, CO3 center dot-, and reactive nitrogen species, on
   product generation were investigated. Multiple isomeric transformation
   products of TMP and SMX were observed, especially in the reaction with
   hydroxyl radical. SO4 center dot- and CO3 center dot- reacted with
   pharmaceuticals by electron transfer, thus producing similar major
   products. The main reactive species deduced on the basis of product
   generation are in good agreement with kinetic simulation of the advanced
   oxidation processes. A strain identified as a polyphosphate-accumulating
   organism was used to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the
   pharmaceuticals and their products. No antimicrobial property was
   detected for the transformation products of either TMP or SMX. Acute
   toxicity employing luminescent bacterium Vibrio qinghaiensis indicated
   20-40\% higher inhibitory effect of TMP and SMX after treatment.
   Ecotoxicity was estimated by quantitative structure-activity
   relationship analysis using ECOSAR}},

Abstract = {{Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) has been proposed as a promising
   alternative to conventional flood cooling to substantially reduce the

   stress induced by grinding process directly affects the surface quality

   stresses and process conditions such as process parameters, material
   properties, and lubrication conditions could support process planning
   and optimization of MQL grinding. This paper has presented a
   physics-based model to predict residual stresses in grinding with
   consideration of the lubrication and cooling effects of MQL. Grinding
   force and temperature distribution in the workpiece are used to
   calculate the loading stresses imparted by MQL grinding. The loading
   stresses are then coupled into a rolling/sliding contact algorithm to
   solve for residual stresses. Experimental measurements of residual
   stress profile under and flood cooling conditions have been pursued to
   calibrate and validate the predicted results.}},

   In the literature, various predictive models have been proposed for
   residual stress in one-pass machining without considering the multi-pass
   aspect. This study describes the regeneration of residual stress in
   multi-pass machining with thermo-mechanical loadings, in the full
   elasto-plastic state, captured using the Neumann-Duhamel principle. The
   residual stress is then analysed satisfying elastic-plastic relaxation
   in-between layers and at the boundaries. Large experimental data in
   milling of AA2121-T3 agreed well with model predictions, thus supporting
   the consideration of initial stress functions, materials cyclic
   plasticity and compatibility to allow for residual stress prediction in

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new optimized and scalable code for Hartree-Fock
   self-consistent field iterations. Goals of the code design include
   scalability to large numbers of nodes, and the capability to
   simultaneously use CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. Issues we
   encountered as we optimized and scaled up the code on Tianhe-2 are
   described and addressed. A major issue is load balance, which is made
   challenging due to integral screening. We describe a general framework
   for finding a well-balanced static partitioning of the load in the
   presence of screening. Work stealing is used to polish the load balance.
   Performance results are shown on Stampede and Tianhe-2 supercomputers.
   Scalability is demonstrated on large simulations involving 2938 atoms
   and 27,394 basis functions, utilizing 8100 nodes of Tianhe-2.}},

Abstract = {{Cost is equally important to power density or efficiency for the
   adoption of waste heat recovery thermoelectric generators (TEG) in many
   transportation and industrial energy recovery applications. In many
   cases, the system design that minimizes cost (e.g., the \$/W value) can
   be very different than the design that maximizes the system's efficiency
   or power density, and it is important to understand the relationship
   between those designs to optimize TEG performance-cost compromises.
   Expanding on recent cost analysis work and using more detailed system
   modeling, an enhanced cost scaling analysis of a waste heat recovery TEG
   with more detailed, coupled treatment of the heat exchangers has been
   performed. In this analysis, the effect of the heat lost to the
   environment and updated relationships between the hot-side and cold-side
   conductances that maximize power output are considered. This coupled
   thermal and thermoelectric (TE) treatment of the exhaust waste heat
   recovery TEG yields modified cost scaling and design optimization
   equations, which are now strongly dependent on the heat leakage
   fraction, exhaust mass flow rate, and heat exchanger effectiveness. This
   work shows that heat exchanger costs most often dominate the overall TE
   system costs, that it is extremely difficult to escape this regime, and
   in order to achieve TE system costs of \$1/Wit is necessary to achieve
   heat exchanger costs of \$1/(W/K). Minimum TE system costs per watt
   generally coincide with maximum power points, but preferred TE design
   regimes are identified where there is little cost penalty for moving
   into regions of higher efficiency and slightly lower power outputs.
   These regimes are closely tied to previously identified low cost design
   regimes. This work shows that the optimum fill factor F-opt minimizing
   system costs decreases as heat losses increase, and increases as exhaust
   mass flow rate and heat exchanger effectiveness increase. These findings
   have profound implications on the design and operation of various TE
   waste heat recovery systems. This work highlights the importance of heat
   exchanger costs on the overall TEG system costs, quantifies the possible
   TEG performance-cost domain space based on heat exchanger effects, and
   provides a focus for future system research and development efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have found strong associations between asthma morbidity
   and major ambient air pollutants. Relatively little research has been
   conducted to assess whether age is a factor conferring susceptibility to
   air pollution-related asthma morbidity. We investigated the short-term
   relationships between asthma emergency department (ED) visits and
   ambient ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
   sulfur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Atlanta
   (1993-2009), Dallas (2006-2009), and St. Louis (2001-2007).
   City-specific daily time-series analyses were conducted to estimate
   associations by age group (0-4, 5-18, 19-39, 40-64, and 65+ years).
   Sub-analyses were performed stratified by race and sex. City-specific
   rate ratios (RRs) were combined by inverse-variance weighting to provide
   an overall association for each strata. The overall RRs differed across
   age groups, with associations for all pollutants consistently strongest
   for children aged 5-18 years. The patterns of association across age
   groups remained generally consistent when models were stratified by sex
   and race, although the strong observed associations among 5-18 year olds
   appeared to be partially driven by non-white and male patients. Our
   findings suggest that age is a susceptibility factor for asthma
   exacerbations in response to air pollution, with school-age children
   having the highest susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{A labeled green fluorescent polystyrene sulfonate (LNaPSS) has been
   synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization of a styrene
   sulfonate monomer with a fluorescent co-monomer, fluorescein
   thiocyanate-vinyl aniline. As a result this 100 \% sulfonated polymer
   contains no hydrophobic patches along the chain backbone besides the
   fluorescent marker itself. The concentration of the fluorescent monomer
   was kept low to maintain the characteristic properties of the anionic
   polyelectrolyte, LNaPSS. ATRP conditions facilitated the production of
   polymers spanning a range of molecular weights from 35,000 to 175,000 in
   gram-scale batches with polydispersity indices of 1.01-1.24. Molecular
   weight increased with the monomer to initiator ratio. Gel permeation
   chromatography results show a unimodal distribution, and the polymer
   structure was also confirmed by H-1 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy.
   Fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed covalent bonding of fluorescein
   isothiocyanate to the polymer, indicating that the polymer is suitable
   as a probe in fluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate this ability, the
   polymer was used to locate structural features in salt crystals formed
   during drying, as in the evaporation of sea mist. A second application
   to probe diffusion studies is also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) based on the type II CRISPR-Cas9 system of
   Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) have been widely used for genome editing in
   experimental models. However, the nontrivial level of off-target
   activity reported in several human cells may hamper clinical
   translation. RGN specificity depends on both the guide RNA (gRNA) and
   the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognized by the Cas9 protein. We
   hypothesized that more stringent PAM requirements reduce the occurrence
   of off-target mutagenesis. To test this postulation, we generated RGNs
   based on two Streptococcus thermophilus (St) Cas9 proteins, which
   recognize longer PAMs, and performed a side-by-side comparison of the
   three RGN systems targeted to matching sites in two endogenous human
   loci, PRKDC and CARD11. Our results demonstrate that in samples with
   comparable on-target cleavage activities, significantly lower off-target
   mutagenesis was detected using St-based RGNs as compared to the standard
   Sp-RGNs. Moreover, similarly to SpCas9, the StCas9 proteins accepted
   truncated gRNAs, suggesting that the specificities of St-based RGNs can
   be further improved. In conclusion, our results show that Cas9 proteins
   with longer or more restrictive PAM requirements provide a safe
   alternative to SpCas9-based RGNs and hence a valuable option for future
   human gene therapy applications.}},

Abstract = {{The clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats
   (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) system from Streptococcus pyogenes
   (Spy) has been successfully adapted for RNA-guided genome editing in a
   wide range of organisms. However, numerous reports have indicated that
   Spy CRISPR-Cas9 systems may have significant off target cleavage of
   genomic DNA sequences differing from the intended on-target site. Here,
   we report the performance of the Neisseria meningitidis (Nme)
   CRISPR-Cas9 system that requires a longer protospacer-adjacent motif for
   site-specific cleavage, and present a comparison between the Spy and Nme
   CRISPR-Cas9 systems targeting the same protospacer sequence. The results
   with the native crRNA and tracrRNA as well as a chimeric single guide
   RNA for the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system were also compared. Our results
   suggest that, compared with the Spy system, the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system
   has similar or lower on-target cleavage activity but a reduced overall
   off-target effect on a genomic level when sites containing three or
   fewer mismatches are considered. Thus, the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system may
   represent a safer alternative for precision genome engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{As an essential component of proteins and genetic material for all
   organisms, nitrogen (N) is one of the major limiting factors that
   control the dynamics, biodiversity and functioning of lacustrine
   wetlands, in which intensified N biogeochemical activities take place.
   Reactive N loaded into wetland ecosystems has been doubled due to
   various human activities, including industrial, agricultural activities
   and urbanization. The main driving mechanisms of N transport and
   transformation in lacustrine wetlands are categorized to pushing forces
   and pulling forces in this study. Geomorphology, wetland age, N
   concentrations, and temperature are the main pushing forces (passive
   forces); whereas water table variation, oxygen concentration, other
   elements availability, oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) and pH, and
   microorganisms are the predominant pulling forces (active forces). The
   direction and kinetic energy of reactions are determined by pulling
   forces and then are stimulated by pushing forces. These two types of
   forces are analyzed and discussed separately. Based on the analysis of
   driving mechanisms, possible solutions to wetland N pollutions are
   proposed at individual, regional and global scales, respectively.
   Additional research needs are addressed to obtain a thorough
   understanding of N transport and transformations in wetlands and to
   reduce detrimental impacts of excessive N on such fragile ecosystems.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cathepsins are mechanosensitive proteases that are regulated not only by
   biochemical factors, but are also responsive to biomechanical forces in
   the cardiovascular system that regulate their expression and activity to
   participate in cardiovascular tissue remodeling. Their elastinolytic and
   collagenolytic activity have been implicated in atherosclerosis,
   abdominal aortic aneurysms, and in heart valve disease, all of which are
   lined by endothelial cells that are the mechanosensitive monolayer of
   cells that sense and respond to fluid shear stress as the blood flows
   across the surfaces of the arteries and valve leaflets. Inflammatory
   cytokine signaling is integrated with biomechanical signaling pathways
   by the endothelial cells to transcribe, translate, and activate either
   the cysteine cathepsins to remodel the tissue or to express their
   inhibitors to maintain healthy cardiovascular tissue structure. Other
   cardiovascular diseases should now be included in the study of the
   cysteine cathepsin activation because of the additional biochemical cues
   they provide that merges with the already existing hemodynamics driving
   cardiovascular disease. Sickle cell disease causes a chronic
   inflammation including elevated TNF alpha and increased numbers of
   circulating monocytes that alter the biochemical stimulation while the
   more viscous red blood cells due to the sickling of hemoglobin alters
   the hemodynamics and is associated with accelerated elastin remodeling
   causing pediatric strokes. HIV-mediated cardiovascular disease also
   occurs earlier in than the broader population and the influence of
   HIV-proteins and antiretrovirals on endothelial cells must be considered
   to understand these accelerated mechanisms in order to identify new
   therapeutic targets for prevention. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Societe

Abstract = {{This letter shows that traditional Newton-Raphson (NR) method cannot
   achieve zero-convergence in presence of additive noise without adding a
   multiplicative gain. Furthermore, this gain needs to converge to zero.
   This article proposes a novel recursive algorithm providing optimal
   iterative-varying gains associated with the NR method. The development
   of the proposed optimal algorithm is based on minimizing a stochastic
   performance index. The estimation error covariance matrix is shown to
   converge to zero for linearized functions while considering additive
   zero-mean white noise. In addition, the proposed approach is capable of
   overcoming common drawbacks associated with the traditional NR method.
   Simulation results are included to illustrate the performance
   capabilities of the proposed algorithm. We show that the proposed
   recursive algorithm provides significant improvement over the
   traditional NR method.}},

Abstract = {{In a cognitive radio (CR) network, the transmitting signal of a
   secondary user (SU) is traditionally considered to be harmful for the
   primary user (PU), since it decreases the capacity of the PU's channel.
   However, for PU's secrecy capacity, the SUs' interference can be
   beneficial if it decreases the capacity of the source-eavesdropper
   channel more than that of the source-destination channel. In this paper,
   we consider using the SUs' interference to improve the PU's secrecy
   capacity and providing the SUs the opportunity to access the spectrum as
   a reward. But, there exists a tradeoff between the SUs' channel capacity
   and the PU's secrecy capacity. To decide which SUs can share the
   spectrum with the PU, we present a coalition formation game model with
   nontransferable utility, and propose a merge and split algorithm. The
   simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in
   terms of both the SUs' channel capacity and the PU's secrecy capacity in
   various scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Deploying spectrum sharing machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with
   the existing wireless networks achieves ubiquitous data transportation
   among objects and the surrounding environment to benefit our daily life.
   However, the lack of schemes to completely characterize M2M network
   topology, to efficiently share radio resource, and to provide
   quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee regarding end-to-end delay creates
   challenges to practically facilitate M2M communications. Via
   mathematical derivations, the network connectivity, degree distribution,
   and average distance are provided for large M2M networks. To achieve
   reliable communications upon such M2M networks, inspired by cognitive
   radio technology and cooperative communications, a cognitive and
   opportunistic relay (COR) scheme is proposed. Specifically, machines
   with the proposed COR autonomously sense the primary systems' spectrum
   usage so as to mitigate detractive interference and adopt opportunistic
   forwarder selection for lower link delay of packet transmissions.
   Furthermore, by analytical deriving the effective capacity of the COR
   over connected M2M networks, the throughput under statistical QoS
   guarantee and the corresponding delay violation probability are proposed
   to specify the QoS guarantee capability of the networks and thus suggest
   the conditions of dependable end-to-end transmissions. Simulation
   results confirm that the proposed COR effectively achieves the delay
   guarantee performance, to yield a novel framework for facilitating
   reliable M2M communications in large machine networks.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{A reduced-order model of transient diesel spray combustion is presented
   that utilizes simplified fluid mechanics and detailed chemical kinetics,
   premised on the similarity between dense turbulent gaseous jets and
   diesel sprays at engine conditions. The presented model offers a new
   capability for detailed chemistry predictions in transient diesel sprays
   since the use of large chemical mechanisms is prohibitively expensive in
   more detailed modeling approaches such as multidimensional computational
   fluid dynamics. The numerical model is validated against Engine
   Combustion Network spray-H experimental data. Predictions of vapor
   penetration, axial mixture fraction distribution, ignition delay, axial
   location of cool-flame reaction, and end-of-injection combustion
   recession show excellent agreement with experimental measurements. The
   model is applied to study modern diesel injection strategies that
   involve significant transient mixing and combustion behavior, including
   fuel injection rate shaping and close-coupled split-injection
   strategies. In general, the model is shown to enable a detailed
   examination of modern diesel injection strategies and the expected
   impact of these strategies on emissions. A slow ramp down of fueling
   rate at the end of injection is found to limit over-mixing in the near
   field of the injector, enabling recession of second-stage ignition
   toward the injector after end of injection. This is advantageous for
   consumption of unburned hydrocarbons and improved combustion efficiency.
   Compared to slow ramp-down injection strategies, close-coupled split
   injections are less effective for unburned hydrocarbon reduction due to
   a strong end-of-injection entrainment wave that accompanies both
   injections, causing rapid over-leaning and no recession of second-stage
   ignition.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of selectivity in catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol in
   mesitylene on hybrid lamellar bulk MFI (HLBM) zeolite materials
   containing dual meso-/microporosity showed that the external Brensted
   acidity in meso-/microporous MFI zeolites effectively impacts on
   selectivity of the parallel alkylation and etherification reactions.
   HLBM zeolites, consisting of crystalline bulk microporous core and
   lamellar mesoporous shell, not only catalyzed the parallel reactions on
   the external environments (external surface and mesopore) but also
   catalyzed the etherification reaction in the internal environment
   (micropore) as illustrated by the completely suppressed alkylation and
   retained residual etherification reactions after
   2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DTBP) poisoning. A systematic study of HLBM
   zeolites with tunable meso-/microporous domain sizes achieved by a dual
   template assisted synthesis revealed that parallel alkylation and
   etherification reactions are tailored by the tunable external surface
   area and external acidity of the HLBM zeolites. The external alkylation
   and etherification reaction rates as a function of cumulative DTBP
   addition suggested the presence of Brensted acid sites with different
   strengths on external environments of the HLBM zeolites, which
   influenced the external etherification reaction, but not as
   significantly as the alkylation reaction. The evidence shown here for
   the involvement of external acidity in catalyzing parallel reactions and
   for the role of external acidity with variable strengths in HLBM zeolite
   materials extends the scope of observed catalytic behaviors of
   meso-/microporous zeolite materials beyond those reflecting transport
   effects and accessibility of acid sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Understanding Communication and Collaboration in Social Product

Abstract = {{Social media have recently been introduced into the arena of
   collaborative design as a new means for seamlessly gathering,
   processing, and sharing product design-related information. As
   engineering design processes are becoming increasingly distributed and
   collaborative, it is crucial to understand the communication and
   collaboration mechanism of engineers participating in such dispersed
   engineering processes. In particular, mapping initially disconnected
   design individuals and teams into an explicit social network is
   challenging. The objective of this paper is to propose a generic
   framework for investigating communication and collaboration mechanisms
   in social media-supported engineering design environments. Specifically,
   we propose an approach for measuring tie strengths in the context of
   distributed and collaborative design. We transform an implicit design
   network into an explicit and formal social network based on specific
   indices of tie strengths. We visualize the process of transforming
   customer needs to functional requirements, to design parameters, and to
   process variables using social network analysis (SNA). Specifically, by
   utilizing a specific index for tie strengths, we can quantitatively
   measure tie strengths in a design network. Based on the tie strengths,
   we can map an implicit design network into an explicit social network.
   Further, using the typical measures (e.g., centrality and cluster
   coefficient) in SNA, we can analyze the social network at both actor and
   systems levels and detect design communities with common design
   interests. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by means of
   two examples. The contribution in this paper is a systematic and formal
   approach that helps gain new insights into communication and
   collaboration mechanisms in distributed and collaborative design.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms and physics of flame stabilization and blow
   off of premixed flames is critical toward the design of high velocity
   combustion devices. In the high bulk flow velocity situation typical of
   practical combustors, the flame anchors in shear layers where the local
   flow velocities are much lower. Within the shear layer, fluid strain
   deformation rates are very high and the flame can be subjected to
   significant stretch levels. The main goal of this work was to
   characterize the flow and stretch conditions that a premixed flame
   experiences in a practical combustor geometry and to compare these
   values to calculated extinction values. High resolution, simultaneous
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser induced fluorescence
   of CH radicals (CH-PLIF) measurements are used to capture the flame edge
   and near-field stabilization region. When approaching lean limit
   extinction conditions, we note characteristic changes in the stretch and
   flow conditions experienced by the flame. Most notably, the flame
   becomes less critically stretched when fuel/air ratio is decreased.
   However, at these lean conditions, the flame is subject to higher mean
   flow velocities at the edge, suggesting less favorable flow conditions
   are present at the attachment point of the flame as blowoff is
   approached. These measurements suggest that blowoff of the flame from
   the shear layer is not directly stretch extinction induced, but rather
   the result of an imbalance between the speed of the flame edge and local
   tangential flow velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation of combustion and emissions outcomes in diesel engines is
   often enhanced by accurate knowledge of the transient fuel delivery rate
   and flow characteristics of the injector nozzle. Important physical
   characteristics of these flows, including velocity profile and flow
   separation or cavitation effects, are difficult to measure directly, but
   can be characterized from a flow-averaged perspective through the
   measurement of nozzle flow coefficients, namely, the discharge,
   velocity, and area-contraction coefficients. Both the transient fuel
   mass flow rate and the flow-averaged nozzle coefficients can be found by
   measuring the mass and momentum flux of the fuel stream leaving the
   nozzle during injection through the application of an impingement
   technique, where fuel is sprayed onto the face of a transducer
   calibrated for force measurement in close proximity to the nozzle. While
   several published experiments have employed the spray impingement method
   to quantify rate of injection, the experimental setup and equipment
   selections vary widely and may contribute to disagreements in measured
   rate of injection. This paper identifies and provides estimates of
   measurement uncertainties that can arise when employing different
   experimental setups using the impingement method. It was observed that
   the impingement technique was sensitive to the design of the strike cap,
   specifically the contact area between the cap and transducer diaphragm,
   in addition to fuel temperature. Conversely, we observed that the
   impingement technique was relatively insensitive to angular and vertical
   misalignment, where the uncertainty can be estimated using control
   volume analysis. Transducer selection, specifically those with low
   acceleration sensitivity, high resonant frequency, and integrated
   electronics piezoelectric circuitry, substantially reduces the noise in
   the measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Functional materials often are hybrids composed of biopolymers and
   mineral constituents. The arrangement and interactions of the
   constituents frequently lead to hierarchical structures with exceptional
   mechanical properties and multifunctionality. In this study, hybrid thin
   films with a nacre-like brick-and-mortar microstructure were fabricated
   in a straightforward and reproducible manner through manual shear
   casting using the biopolymer chitosan as the matrix material (mortar)
   and alumina platelets as the reinforcing particles (bricks). The ratio
   of inorganic to organic content was varied from 0\% to 15\% and the
   relative humidities from 36\% to 75\% to determine their effects on the
   mechanical properties. It was found that increasing the volume fraction
   of alumina from 0\% to 15\% results in a twofold increase in the modulus
   of the film, but decreases the tensile strength by up to 30\%, when the
   volume fraction of alumina is higher than 5\%. Additionally, this study
   quantifies and illustrates the critical role of the relative humidity on
   the mechanical properties of the hybrid film. Increasing the relative
   humidity from 36\% to 75\% decreases the modulus and strength by about
   45\% and triples the strain at failure. These results suggest that
   complex hybrid materials can be manufactured and tailor made for
   specific applications or environmental conditions. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Here, we investigated whether hyperglycemia and/or free fatty acids

   protein 4 (BMP4), a proatherogenic marker, in endothelial cells and the
   potential role of BMP4 in diabetic vascular complications. To measure
   BMP4 expression, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
   exposed to high glucose concentrations and/ or PAL for 24 or 72 h, and
   the effects of these treatments on the expression levels of adhesion
   molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined. BMP4
   loss-of-function status was achieved via transfection of a BMP4-specific
   siRNA. High glucose levels increased BMP4 expression in HUVECs in a
   dose-dependent manner. PAL potentiated such expression. The levels of
   adhesion molecules and ROS production increased upon treatment with high
   glucose and/or PAL, but this eff ect was negated when BMP4 was knocked
   down via siRNA. Signaling of BMP4, a proinfl ammatory and
   pro-atherogenic cytokine marker, was increased by hyperglycemia and PAL.
   BMP4 induced the expression of infl ammatory adhesion molecules and ROS

Abstract = {{Two routes to the thermal decomposition of poly(propylene carbonate)
   (PPC) have been considered polymer chain-end unzipping and random chain
   scission. The inhibition and catalysis of each mechanism has been
   studied. End-capping of low molecular weight (2 kDa) PPC has been
   achieved and confirmed with NMR analysis resulting in stabilization from
   unzipping. Citric acid was used as an additive and shown to stabilize
   the PPC backbone from random chain scission. The combination of both
   stabilizing agents (i.e. unzipping and ransom chain scission) results in
   the highest thermal stability. Photo-acid and base generators were
   incorporated into films and used to catalyze decomposition pathways of
   PPC. Residual solvent effects in PPC, such as methanol used in its
   purification, have been shown to affect the thermal stability through
   interactions with the backbone of PPC. This study demonstrates a widened
   thermal stability window for PPC, such as when used as a sacrificial

Abstract = {{The aerospace industry is currently transitioning to More Electric
   subsystem architectures due to steadily improving electric technologies
   and the technology saturation of established conventional architectures.
   For aircraft with such unconventional architectures, the lack of
   historical information and the presence of increased inter-subsystem
   interactions create a significant design challenge. These necessitate a
   greater focus on subsystems design earlier in the design process than
   typically seen for aircraft with conventional subsystem architectures.
   At the same time, however, to be suitable for the early design phases,
   the subsystem analyses must be computationally inexpensive and not
   require detailed aircraft definition. This work presents an integrated,
   modular, and tool-independent approach to the sizing and performance
   analysis of the aircraft and its subsystems, in which inter-dependencies
   are established between relevant aircraft and subsystem level
   parameters. The approach allows the assessment of subsystem
   architectures using vehicle and mission level metrics for a fixed
   vehicle design, and also the amplified effect of re-sizing the vehicle
   in accordance with a pre-defined rule-set. The proposed approach was
   demonstrated through a comparative assessment of a predominantly
   electric subsystem architecture and a conventional one for a
   representative single-aisle aircraft. In this assessment, the impacts of
   changing the form of secondary power extraction, the change in vehicle
   empty weight, and re-sizing of the vehicle were successively identified.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis of a reciprocating hydraulic rod seal with a

   friction force, film thickness distribution, contact pressure
   distribution and fluid pressure distribution in the sealing zone have
   been computed for a polyurethane U-cup. seal. Starvation during the

   results indicate the friction force exerted on the rod by the seal
   cannot be significantly reduced by texturing the rod, and could even be

   resulting criteria enabled their incorporation into deterministic and
   probabilistic slope stability analysis of offshore developments within
   the geographical information system. In contrast to conventional
   limiting equilibrium approaches used in such analysis, the shear band
   propagation approach is capable of explaining enormous dimensions of
   observed palaeo-landslides and predicting annual probabilities of

Abstract = {{A platform has been presented for wireless powering of receivers (Rx's)
   that are arbitrarily distributed over a large area. A potential
   application could be powering of small Rx implants, distributed over
   large areas of the brain. The transmitter (Tx) consists of three
   overlapping layers of hexagonal planar spiral coils (hex-PSC) that are
   horizontally shifted to provide the strongest and most homogeneous
   electromagnetic flux coverage. The three-layer hex-PSC array is driven
   by a three-phase time-division-multiplexed power Tx that takes the
   advantage of the carrier phase shift, coil geometries, and Rx time
   constant to homogeneously power the arbitrarily distributed Rx's
   regardless of their misalignments. The functionality of the proposed
   three-phase power transmission concept has been verified in a detailed
   scaled-up high-frequency structure simulator Advanced Design System
   simulation model and measurement setup, and compared with a conventional
   Tx. The new Tx delivers 5.4 mW to each Rx and achieves, on average,

Title = {{Cooperative Relative Navigation for Space Rendezvous and Proximity
   Operations using Controlled Active Vision}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{205-228}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This work aims to solve the problem of relative navigation for space
   rendezvous and proximity operations using a monocular camera in a
   numerically efficient manner. It is assumed that the target spacecraft
   has a special pattern to aid the task of relative pose estimation, and
   that the chaser spacecraft uses a monocular camera as the primary visual
   sensor. In this sense, the problem falls under the category of
   cooperative relative navigation in orbit. While existing systems for
   cooperative localization with fiducial markers allow full
   six-degrees-of-freedom pose estimation, the majority of them are not
   suitable for in-space cooperative navigation (especially when involving
   a small-size chaser spacecraft), due to their computational cost.
   Moreover, most existing fiducial-based localization methods are designed
   for ground-based applications with limited range (e.g., ground robotics,
   augmented reality), and their performance deteriorates under large-scale
   changes, such as those encountered in space applications. Using an
   adaptive visual algorithm, we propose an accurate and numerically
   efficient approach for real-time vision-based relative navigation,
   especially designed for space robotics applications. The proposed method
   achieves low computational cost and high accuracy and robustness via the
   following innovations: first, an adaptive visual pattern detection
   scheme based on the estimated relative pose is proposed, which improves
   both the efficiency of detection and the accuracy of pose estimates;
   second, a parametric blob detector called Box-LoG is used, which is
   computationally efficient; and third, a fast and robust algorithm is
   introduced, which jointly solves the data association and pose
   estimation problems. In addition to having an accuracy comparable to
   state-of-the-art cooperative localization algorithms, our method
   demonstrates a significant improvement in speed and robustness for
   scenarios with large range changes. A vision-based closed-loop
   experiment using the Autonomous Spacecraft Testing of Robotic Operations
   in Space (ASTROS) testbed demonstrates the performance benefits of the
   proposed approach.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Policymakers, consumers, and industry leaders are increasingly concerned
   about the environmental impacts of modern products. In response, product
   designers seek simple and effective methods for lowering the
   environmental footprints of their concepts. Design for environment (DfE)
   is a field of product design methodology that includes tools, methods,
   and principles to help designers reduce environmental impact. The most
   powerful and well-known tool for DfE is life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA
   requires a fully specified design, however, which makes it applicable
   primarily at the end of the design process. Because the decisions with
   the greatest environmental impact are made during early design stages
   when data for a comprehensive LCA are not yet available, it is important
   to develop DfE tools that can be implemented in the early conceptual and
   embodiment design stages. Based on a broad critical review of DfE
   literature and best practices, a set of 76 DfE guidelines are compiled
   and reconciled for use in early stage design of products with minimal
   environmental impact. Select guidelines are illustrated through
   examples, and several strategies for using the guidelines are
   introduced.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Surgery is indicated for cerebral cavernous malformations
   (CCMs) that cause medically refractory epilepsy. Real-time magnetic
   resonance thermography (MRT)-guided stereotactic laser ablation (SLA) is
   a minimally invasive approach to treating focal brain lesions. SLA of
   CCM has not previously been described.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe MRT-guided SLA, a novel approach to treating
   CCM-related epilepsy, with respect to feasibility, safety, imaging, and
   seizure control in 5 consecutive patients.
   METHODS: Five patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing
   standard presurgical evaluation were found to have corresponding lesions
   fulfilling imaging characteristics of CCM and were prospectively
   enrolled. Each underwent stereotactic placement of a saline-cooled
   cannula containing an optical fiber to deliver 980-nm diode laser energy
   via twist drill craniostomy. MR anatomic imaging was used to evaluate
   targeting before ablation. MR imaging provided evaluation of targeting
   and near real-time feedback regarding the extent of tissue
   thermocoagulation. Patients maintained seizure diaries, and remote
   imaging (6-21 months postablation) was obtained in all patients.
   RESULTS: Imaging revealed no evidence of acute hemorrhage following
   fiber placement within presumed CCM. MRT during treatment and immediate
   postprocedure imaging confirmed the desired extent of ablation. We
   identified no adverse events or neurological deficits. Four of 5 (80\%)
   patients achieved freedom from disabling seizures after SLA alone (Engel
   class 1 outcome), with follow-up ranging 12 to 28 months. Re imaging of
   all subjects (6-21 months) indicated lesion diminution with surrounding
   liquefactive necrosis, consistent with the surgical goal of extended
   lesionotomy.
   CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive MRT-guided SLA of epileptogenic CCM is a
   potentially safe and effective alternative to open resection. Additional
   experience and longer follow-up are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Perhaps the most thorough characterization of the elevated pressure
   properties of any commercial EHL lubricant is presented here for a gear

   measured. Of particular interest is the shear dependence of viscosity,
   measured across four decades of stress, which shows two transitions each
   with a specific value of power-law exponent. An attempt to capture a
   suspected third transition at very high stress resulted in mechanical
   degradation of the liquid in the viscometer. Numerical simulations of a
   point contact between a steel ball and a glass disc showed good
   agreement over a range of slide-to-roll ratio for the measured central
   thickness. The agreement for the minimum thickness was excellent. A new
   result is that shear-thinning of a higher molecular weight component
   that occurs from 3 to 200kPa had little effect on the film thickness and

Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{113-123}},

Abstract = {{Cell detachment and migration from the endothelium occurs during
   vasculogenesis and also in pathological states. Here, we use a novel
   approach to trigger single cell release from an endothelial monolayer by
   in-situ opening of adhesive, fibril-like environment using
   light-responsive ligands and scanning lasers. Cell escapes from the
   monolayer were observed on the fibril-like adhesive tracks with 3-15 rho
   m width. The frequency of endothelial cell escapes increased
   monotonically with the fibril width and with the density of the
   light-activated adhesive ligand. Interestingly, treatment with VEGF
   induced cohesiveness within the cell layer, preventing cell leaks. When
   migrating through the tracks, cells presented body lateral reduction and
   nuclear deformation imposed by the line width and dependent on myosin
   contractility. Cell migration mode changed from mesenchymal to
   amoeboid-like when the adhesive tracks narrowed (<= 5 mu m). Moreover,
   cell nucleus was shrunk showing packed DNA on lines narrower than the
   nuclear dimensions in a mechanisms intimately associated with the stress
   fibers. This platform allows the detailed study of escapes and migratory
   transitions of cohesive cells, which are relevant processes in
   development and during diseases such as organ fibrosis and carcinomas.

Title = {{Mixed-mode cohesive zone parameters for sub-micron scale stacked layers
   to predict microelectronic device reliability}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{259-277}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With continued feature size reduction in microelectronics and with more
   than a billion transistors on a single integrated circuit (IC), on-chip
   interconnection has become a challenge in terms of processing-,
   electrical-, thermal-, and mechanical perspective. Today's
   high-performance ICs have on-chip back-end-of-line (BEOL) layers that
   consist of copper traces and vias interspersed with low-k dielectric
   materials. These layers have thicknesses in the range of 100 nm near the
   transistors and 1000 nm away from the transistors and near the solder
   bumps. In such BEOL stacks, cracking and/or delamination is a common
   failure mode due to the low mechanical and adhesive strength of the
   dielectric materials as well as due to high thermally-induced stresses.
   However, there are no available cohesive zone models and parameters to
   study such interfacial cracks in sub-micron thick microelectronic
   layers.
   This work focuses on developing framework based on cohesive zone
   modeling approach to study interfacial delamination in sub-micron thick
   layers. Such a framework is then successfully applied to predict
   microelectronic device reliability. As intentionally creating
   pre-fabricated cracks in such interfaces is difficult, this work
   examines a combination of four-point bend and double-cantilever beam
   tests to create initial cracks and to develop cohesive zone parameters
   over a range of mode mixity. Similarly, a combination of four-point bend
   and end-notch flexure tests is used to cover additional range of mode
   mixity. In these tests, silicon wafers obtained from wafer foundry are
   used for experimental characterization. The developed parameters are
   then used in actual microelectronic device to predict the onset and
   propagation of crack, and the results from such predictions are
   successfully validated with experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The thalamus is a relay center between various subcortical brain areas
   and the cerebral cortex with delineation of its constituent nuclei being

   used approaches that do not consider the dynamic nature of
   thalamo-cortical interactions. In this study, we explicitly exploited
   the dynamic variation of thalamo-cortical connections to identify
   different states of functional connectivity and performed state-specific
   thalamus parcellation. With normalized spectral clustering successively
   applied in temporal and spatial domains, nine thalamo-cortical
   connectivity states were identified and the dynamic thalamus
   parcellation revealed finer thalamic structures with improved atlas
   correspondence. The present results extend our understanding of
   thalamo-cortical connectivity and provide a more comprehensive view of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A unique, beneficial feature of rotorcraft is their flexibility in
   aircraft-to-ground interfacing. For a variety of reasons, hard landings
   can occur when the descent rate of the aircraft is larger than intended.
   The resulting impact can result in vehicle damage, structural failure,
   injuries, etc. To reduce these risks, an attractive solution is the
   implementation of a robotic legged landing gear (RLLG) system. The
   system softens a hard landing by acting as a shock absorber with a
   relatively large stroke, allowing the aircraft to decelerate over a much
   larger distance compared with a tradition landing gear system. This
   paper explores the mitigation of rotorcraft hard landings via RLLG
   through a comprehensive multibody dynamics simulation tool. The purpose
   of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the RLLG as a robust
   solution to reduce loads during hard landings for multiple landing
   configurations. The results show that when using RLLG in place of
   conventional landing gear, peak loads are reduced by approximately
   70-90\%, depending on the landing conditions. Through Monte Carlo
   simulation, robotic landing gear system performance is shown to be
   robust to uncertain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Benchmarks are heavily used in different areas of computer science to
   evaluate algorithms and tools. In program analysis and testing,
   open-source and commercial programs are routinely used as benchmarks to
   evaluate different aspects of algorithms and tools. Unfortunately, many
   of these programs are written by programmers who introduce different
   biases, not to mention that it is very difficult to find programs that
   can serve as benchmarks with high reproducibility of results. We propose
   a novel approach for generating random benchmarks for evaluating program
   analysis and testing tools and compilers. Our approach uses stochastic
   parse trees, where language grammar production rules are assigned
   probabilities that specify the frequencies with which instantiations of
   these rules will appear in the generated programs. We implemented our
   tool for Java and applied it to generate a set of large benchmark
   programs of up to 5Mlines of code each with which we evaluated different
   program analysis and testing tools and compilers. The generated
   benchmarks let us independently rediscover several issues in the
   evaluated tools. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   damage detection methods have been developed in recent years. Among
   these methods, transmissibility function analysis can offer advantages
   in easy and low-cost implementation, as well as independency to the
   magnitude and waveform of an excitation record. Harnessing these
   features, a decentralized structural damage detection procedure is
   proposed in this paper. The proposed procedure only requires
   measurements in one small area at a time, and thus, is ideal for using
   limited number of sensors upon a large-scale structure. This study also
   investigates the nature of transmissibility functions for damage
   detection in an analytical manner, based on a chain-like
   spring-mass-damper system with multiple degrees-of-freedom. The
   analytical derivation is validated through numerical simulation and
   laboratory experiments using mobile sensors. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Membrane fouling is an important shortcoming limiting the efficiency and
   wide application of reverse osmosis (RO) technology. In this paper, RO
   membranes in a full-scale municipal wastewater reclamation plant were
   autopsied. From the lead to tail position RO membranes in RO system,
   both of organic and inorganic matters on membranes reduced gradually.
   The higher ion products in RO concentrate didn't result in more serious
   inorganic scaling on the last position RO membranes, which was contrast
   with some other researches. Fe, Ca and Mg were major inorganic elements.
   Fe had a relatively low concentration in RO influent but the highest
   content on membranes. However, there was no specific pretreatment in
   terms of Fe removal. Ca and Mg scaling was controlled by the
   antiscalants injected. Organic fouling (75.0-84.5\% of dry weights) was
   major problem on RO membranes due to the large amount of dissolved
   organic matters in secondary effluent as raw water. Hydrophilic acid
   (HIA, 48.0\% of total DOC), hydrophobic acid (HOA, 23.6\%) and
   hydrophobic neutral (HON, 19.0\%) fraction was largest among the six
   fractions in RO influent, while HON (38.2-51.1\%) and HOA (22.1-26.1\%)
   tended to accumulate on membranes in higher quantities. Monitoring HON
   and HOA might help to forecast organic fouling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   calculations of metals and insulators}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{96-107}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present the Clenshaw-Curtis Spectral Quadrature (SQ) method for
   real-space O(N) Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In this
   approach, all quantities of interest are expressed as bilinear forms or
   sums over bilinear forms, which are then approximated by spatially
   localized Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules. This technique is
   identically applicable to both insulating and metallic systems, and in
   conjunction with local reformulation of the electrostatics, enables the
   O(N) evaluation of the electronic density, energy, and atomic forces.
   The SQ approach also permits infinite-cell calculations without recourse
   to Brillouin zone integration or large supercells. We employ a finite
   difference representation in order to exploit the locality of electronic
   interactions in real space, enable systematic convergence, and
   facilitate large-scale parallel implementation. In particular, we derive
   expressions for the electronic density, total energy, and atomic forces
   that can be evaluated in O(N) operations. We demonstrate the systematic
   convergence of energies and forces with respect to quadrature order as
   well as truncation radius to the exact diagonalization result. In
   addition, we show convergence with respect to mesh size to established
   O(N-3) planewave results. Finally, we establish the efficiency of the
   proposed approach for high temperature calculations and discuss its
   particular suitability for large-scale parallel computation. (C) 2015

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The buckling and postbuckling responses of viscoelastic-layered
   composites are investigated using finite-element simulations. These
   composites consist of alternating layers of a stiff elastic constituent
   and of a soft viscoelastic constituent. In response to compressive loads
   in the layer direction, elastic instabilities significantly affect the
   finite deformation mechanics of these composites. The dependence of the
   critical strain and critical wavenumber on strain rate is analyzed. In
   the postbuckling regime, the wavenumber of the mode of deformation is
   found to be highly dependent on strain rate and time and can be used to
   identify three different regimes that depend on the volume fraction of
   the stiff constituent. Interestingly, a transition from a wrinkling mode
   to a longwave mode can be observed when the strain rate is varied for
   moderate volume fractions of the stiff material. Analytical formulae for
   the buckling and postbuckling of the elastic-layered composites are used
   to interpret numerical results obtained for viscoelastic-layered
   composites. Viscoelastic-layered composites exhibit a wide range of
   rate-dependent mechanical behavior and could have applications in
   vibration damping and acoustic metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz (THz) reflection imaging is applied to characterize a woven

   associated with the THz pulse reflected off the interfaces of the
   delamination and suppress the contrast of THz C- and B-scans. Wavelet
   shrinkage de-noising is performed to remove water-vapor features,
   leading to enhanced THz C- and B-scans to locate the delamination in

Abstract = {{Breakage of thin solar silicon wafers during handling and transport
   depends on the stresses imposed on the wafer by the handling/transport
   device. In this paper, the stresses generated in solar silicon wafers by
   a rigid vacuum gripper are analyzed via a combination of experiments and
   numerical modeling. Specifically, stresses produced in monocrystalline
   (Cz) and multicrystalline (Cast) silicon wafers of different thicknesses
   when handled by a vacuum gripper are analyzed using the finite element
   (FE) method. With the measured surface profiles of the wafer and the
   gripper as input, the handling process is simulated using FE modeling
   and the stress distribution obtained. The FE modeling results are
   validated by experimental data of wafer surface profile during handling.
   The results show that while the vacuum level does not have significant
   impact on the stress distribution, the initial surface profiles of the
   thin wafer and gripper play a dominant role in producing regions of high

Abstract = {{Develop a fast setting and controllable degrading magnesium-calcium
   silicate cement (Mg-CS) by sol-gel, and establish a mechanism using Mg
   ions to stimulate human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs) are two
   purposes of this study. We have used the diametral tensile strength
   measurement to obtain the mechanical strength and stability of Mg-CS
   cement; in addition, the cement degradation properties is realized by
   measuring the releasing amount of Si and Mg ions in the simulated body
   fluid. The other cell characteristics of hPDLs, such as proliferation,
   differentiation and mineralization were examined while hPDLs were
   cultured on specimen surfaces. This study found out the degradation rate
   of Mg-CS cements depends on the Mg content in CS. Regarding in vitro
   bioactivity; the CS cements were covered with abundant clusters of
   apatite spherulites after immersion of 24 h, while less apatite
   spherulites were formatted on the Mg-rich cement surfaces. In addition,
   the authors also explored the effects of Mg ions on the odontogenesis
   and angiogenesis differentiation of hPDLs in comparison with CS cement.
   The proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, odontogenesis-related genes
   (DSPP and DMP-1), and angiogenesis-related protein (vWF and ang-1)
   secretion of hPDLs were significantly stimulated when the Mg content of
   the specimen was increased. The results in this study suggest that Mg-CS
   materials with this modified composition could stimulate hPDLs behavior
   and can be good bioceramics for bone substitutes and hard tissue
   regeneration applications as they stimulate odontogenesis/angiogenesis.

Title = {{Computational homogenization in RVE models with material periodic
   conditions for CNT polymer composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{RVE models with material periodic conditions are developed in generating
   a 3D network of fillers within the RVE. Computational homogenization in
   3D RVE models is achieved using two approaches. In the first approach,
   statistical analysis with number of realizations is performed with
   increasing RVE size of randomly generated CNT within polymer. In
   statistical analysis, the filler that exceeds the RVE are translated
   until they find new spatial location within RVE. Simulations with
   increasing RVE size are performed until the standard deviation of
   computed apparent property for each RVE size is minimum to predict the
   critical RVE size. In the second approach, RVE models with material
   periodic boundary conditions are developed, which involve placing
   fillers that exceed the RVE into their respective position on the
   opposite face of RVE as if the RVE is part of a larger network of RVEs.
   Percolation threshold analysis of CNT filled polymer composites is
   presented using both computational homogenization approaches. It is
   demonstrated that computational homogenized models with material
   periodic conditions are independent of RVE size and provide homogenized
   results and are computationally efficient compared to statistical
   models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of locomotives run in the North America railroad network and
   each of them must receive periodic maintenance service; meanwhile, the
   locomotives may break down during shipment operations and demand repair.
   Maintenance shops are characterized by the types of locomotives they can
   handle and the level of service they can provide. This article
   formulates a mixed-integer program model to optimize location and
   capacity of locomotive maintenance shops. The objective is to minimize
   the sum of the costs for building new (or shutting down existing)
   maintenance shops, the costs for capacity expansion (or reduction), and
   the costs for shipping broken locomotives to a suitable shop. A
   Lagrangian-relaxation-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the
   shop location and capacity planning problem. The model and solution
   techniques are applied to a full-scale real-world case study, while the
   computational results show that the current maintenance shops are overly
   built and recommend that two maintenance shops should be closed and an
   amount of capacities should be reduced from the existing shops. A series
   of numerical sensitivity analyses are also conducted to draw managerial
   insights.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis is a progressive joint disease that results in
   degradation of cartilage in load-bearing joints. Pain and inflammation
   in the joint are the hallmarks of this condition, which further
   exacerbate the cartilage destruction and health of the patient. It is
   hence imperative to treat the joint inflammation at the earliest.
   Interleukin 1 (IL-1) blockade by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has
   shown promise in the clinic but this therapy suffers from rapid
   clearance, high doses, and frequent intervention. Use of carrier
   particles that result in longer residence time has been proposed. Here
   we have synthesized a new class of nanoparticles presenting IL-1Ra on
   the surface and with tunable size from 300 to 700 nm. These
   IL-1Ra-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-pyridine nanoparticles are
   cytocompatible and stable in serum-containing solutions for several
   days. Our results further demonstrate that these nanoparticles are
   capable of blocking IL-1 signaling in an NF-B inducible reporter cell
   line. These engineered nanoparticles are promising for localized
   intra-articular delivery in joint space to reduce inflammation in
   osteoarthritis and other inflammatory diseases. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Most boron diffusion technologies result in the formation of an
   undesirable boron-rich layer (BRL) on the emitter surface. This paper
   reports on a study of the impact of gradual etching of the BRL on n-type
   silicon solar cell performance. It is found that gradual removal of the
   BRL improves surface passivation and bulk lifetime in the finished cell,
   while over-etching of the BRL results in a sharp decrease in fill factor
   due to the increased n-factor and series resistance. It is shown that
   the optimum chemical etching of the BRL formed as a byproduct of the
   screen-printed boron emitter diffusion used in this study raised the
   cell efficiency by similar to 0.5\%, resulting in 20.0\% efficient large
   area (239 cm(2)) n-type solar cells. The change in BRL thickness and
   morphology as a function of chemical etching time was investigated by
   TEM and AES measurements to explain the quantitative impact of BRL
   removal on cell performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to understand the effect of compounding
   method and polymer physical properties on the electrical response of
   exfoliated graphite nanoplatelet (GNP)/polylactic acid (PLA)
   nanocomposite films. Two compounding methods were employed: (i) melt
   mixing, followed by compression molding, and (ii) solution mixing once
   the polymer was dissolved in chloroform, followed by solution casting.
   The physical properties of the polymer, namely the crystallization
   characteristics were altered using two different cooling rates during
   compression molding: (i) slow cooling and (ii) fast cooling. The
   microstructure of the films was examined using scanning electron
   microscopy. Thermal properties, crystallization behavior, and electrical
   behavior were determined as a function of the GNP content, compounding
   method, and cooling rate using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray
   diffraction, and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. It was concluded
   that the SC films had the lowest percolation threshold between 1 and 5
   wt\% of GNP, followed by the solution-cast films with percolation
   threshold between 5 and 8 wt\% of GNP. The FC films did not percolate
   until a GNP content of 15 wt\% was used. The vast differences in
   percolation thresholds are attributed to the differences in polymer
   matrix crystallinity and composite microstructure both in terms of
   microporosity and GNP dispersion/distribution within the polymer due to
   the different cooling rates and different compounding methods employed.}},

Abstract = {{A new nanocomposite manufacturing process, Dual-material aerosol jet
   printing (DMAJP), was developed to fabricate polyimide (PI)/carbon
   nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite with tailorable and controllable intra-part

   solution of PI precursor to achieve a homogenous dispersion of CNTs in
   the PI matrix. The mixing ratio of the two aerosols determines the CNT
   loading in the nanocomposite, which can be used to control the
   conductivity of the film. Thickness, nanostructure, and conductivity of
   the nanocomposites fabricated under different process conditions were
   investigated. The high degree with which the printed PI/CNT
   nanocomposite film may be tailored was demonstrated through three
   examples: a film with different CNT loadings at designated regions; a
   film with a built-in circuit; and a film with a through-thickness
   conductive channel. DMAJP is a facile, versatile, and potentially
   scalable manufacturing process for the next generation of smart

Abstract = {{Although having remarkable mechanical properties, metallic glass is
   severely limited by the lack of toughness and hardening ability which
   are among the basic requirements for structural and functional
   applications. Various attempts have been made experimentally to address
   these issues but with very limited improvement. Here we report a new
   attempt via material design approach using finite element modeling. We
   deliberately introduce statistical heterogeneity into the metallic glass
   samples, i.e. free volume dispersity. We show that the plasticity and
   toughness can be enhanced systematically with the increase of the
   heterogeneity and in certain circumstance even apparent hardening can be
   achieved. We will discuss the underlying mechanisms and also possible
   design of new metallic glass composites using the concept of

Title = {{Isolation of ultrasonic scattering by wavefield baseline subtraction}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70-71}},
Pages = {{891-903}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Wavefield imaging generally refers to the measurement of signals over a
   two-dimensional rectilinear grid that originate from a spatially fixed
   source. Subtraction of such wavefields is investigated as a means of
   separating scattered signals from the total wavefield; that is, baseline
   wavefield data acquired from a defect-free specimen are subtracted from
   analogous data acquired after introduction of a defect. The wavefields
   considered here are generated by a 5 MHz angle-beam probe and measured
   over an area of the accessible specimen surface using a laser
   vibrometer. The primary challenge in isolating the scattered waves is
   imperfect temporal and spatial alignment of the two wavefields. Two
   methods for aligning the wavefields in space and time prior to
   performing baseline subtraction are presented and their efficacy is
   evaluated using data acquired before and after introducing notches that
   originate from a through-hole. Although perfect baseline subtraction is
   not achieved, the improvement in performance after alignment using
   either method allows for scattered waves from small defects to be
   separated and visualized, even when their amplitudes are much smaller
   than those of the incident waves. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1873-1886}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simplified space vector modulation (SVM) scheme
   for multilevel converters. Compared with earlier SVM methods, the
   proposed scheme simplifies the detection of the nearest three vectors
   and the generation of switching sequences, and therefore is
   computationally more efficient. Particularly, for the first time, the
   proposed scheme achieves the same easy implementation as phase-voltage
   modulation techniques. Another superior characteristic of the proposed
   scheme over earlier methods is its potential for multiphase multilevel
   applications. The proposed scheme also offers the following significant
   advantages: 1) independence of the level number of the converter; 2)
   more degrees of freedom, i.e., redundant switching sequences and
   adjustable duty cycles, to optimize the switching patterns; and 3) no
   need for lookup tables or coordinate transformations. These advantages
   make the proposed scheme well suited to large level-number applications,
   such as modular multilevel converters and high voltage direct current
   systems. Simulation and experimental results verify this new concept.}},

Title = {{Atrial systole enhances intraventricular filling flow propagation during
   increasing heart rate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{Diastolic fluid dynamics in the left ventricle (LV) has been examined in
   multiple clinical studies for understanding cardiac function in healthy
   humans and developing diagnostic measures in disease conditions. The
   question of how intraventricular filling vortex flow pattern is affected
   by increasing heart rate (HR) is still unanswered. Previous studies on
   healthy subjects have shown a correlation between increasing HR and
   diminished E/A ratio of transmitral peak velocities during early filling
   (E-wave) to atrial systole (A-wave). We hypothesize that with increasing
   HR under constant E/A ratio, E-wave contribution to intraventricular
   vortex propagation is diminished. A physiologic in vitro flow phantom
   consisting of a LV physical model was used for this study. HR was varied
   across 70,100 and 120 beats per minute (bpm) with E/A of 1.1-1.2.
   Intraventricular flow patterns were characterized using 2D particle
   image velocimetry measured across three parallel longitudinal
   (apical-basal) planes in the LV. A pair of counter-rotating vortices was
   observed during E-wave across all HRs. With increasing HR, diminished
   vortex propagation occurred during E-wave and atrial systole was found
   to amplify secondary vorticity production. The diastolic time point
   where peak vortex circulation occurred was delayed with increasing HR,
   with peak circulation for 120 bpm occurring as late as 90\% into
   diastole near the end of A-wave. The role of atrial systole is elevated
   for higher HR due to the limited time available for filling. Our
   baseline findings and analysis approach can be applied to studies of
   clinical conditions where impaired exercise tolerance is observed. (C)

Abstract = {{Aluminum oxide coatings deposited on LiMn2O4/carbon fiber electrodes by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) are shown to enhance cathode performance
   in lithium-ion batteries. With a thin Al2O3 coating derived from 10 ALD
   cycles, the electrodes exhibit 2.5 times greater capacity retention over
   500 cycles at a rate of 1C as well as enhanced rate capability and
   decreased polarization resistance. Structural and surface studies of the
   electrodes before and after cycling reveal that a near-surface
   phenomenon is responsible for the improved electrochemical performance.
   The crystal structure and overall morphology of the LiMn2O4 electrode
   are found to be unaffected by electrochemical cycling, both for coated
   and uncoated samples. However, evidence of Mn diffusion into the ALD
   coatings is observed from both transmission electron
   microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) and X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) after electrochemical cycling.
   Furthermore, XPS analysis of the Al 2p photoemission peak for the ALD
   coated electrodes reveal a significant shift in binding energy and peak
   shape, suggesting the presence of an Al-O-F compound formed by
   sequestering HF in the electrolyte. These observations provide new
   insight toward understanding the mechanism in which ultrathin coatings
   of amphoteric oxides can inhibit capacity loss for LiMn2O4 cathodes in
   lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   diffraction (XRD), Archimedes' drainage method, scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and thermal
   dilatometer techniques. With increasing copper doping content, the ionic
   conductivity of La(10)Si(6-x)Cu(x)O(27-delta)increased, reaching a
   maximum of 4.8 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C for x = 1.5. The
   improved ionic conductivity could be primarily associated with the
   enhanced grain conductivity. The power output performance of
   NiO-LSCO/LSCO/LSCF single cell was superior to that obtained on
   NiO-LSO/LSO/LSCF at different temperatures using hydrogen as fuel and
   oxygen as oxidant, which could be attributed to the enhanced oxygen
   ionic conductivity as well as the sintering density for the copped doped
   lanthanum silicate. In conclusion, the apatite La10Si4.5Cu1.5O25.5 is a
   promising candidate electrolyte for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We investigate multicompartment micelles consisting of
   poly(2-oxazoline)-based triblock copolymers for nanoreactor
   applications, using the DPD simulation method to characterize the
   internal structure of the micelles and the distribution of reactant. The
   DPD simulation parameters are determined from the Flory-Huggins
   interaction parameter (chi(FH)). From the snapshots of the micellar
   structures and radial distribution function of polymer blocks, it is
   clearly presented that the micelle is multicompartmental. In addition,
   by implementing the DPD simulations in the presence of reactants, it is
   found that Reac-C4 and Reac-OPh are associate well with the hydrophilic
   shell of the micelle, whereas the other two reactants, Reac-Ph and
   Reac-Cl, are not incorporated into the micelle. From our DPD
   simulations, we confirm that the miscibility (solubility) of reactant
   with the micelle has a strong correlation with the rate of hydrolysis
   kinetic resolution. Utilizing accurate methods evaluating accurate
   chi(FH) parameters for molecular interactions in micelle system, this
   DPD simulation can have a great potential to predict the structures of
   micelles consisting of designed multiblock copolymers for useful
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework to realize helical edge states in phononic
   systems using two identical lattices with interlayer couplings between
   them. A methodology is presented to systematically transform a quantum
   mechanical lattice which exhibits edge states to a phononic lattice,
   thereby developing a family of lattices with edge states. Parameter
   spaces with topological phase boundaries in the vicinity of the
   transformed system are illustrated to demonstrate the robustness to
   mechanical imperfections. A potential realization in terms of
   fundamental mechanical building blocks is presented for the hexagonal
   and Lieb lattices. The lattices are composed of passive components and
   the building blocks are a set of disks and linear springs. Furthermore,
   by varying the spring stiffness, topological phase transitions are
   observed, illustrating the potential for tunability of our lattices. (C)

Title = {{Study of nanoindentation mechanical response of nanocrystalline
   structures using molecular dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{364}},
Pages = {{190-200}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study the
   nanoindentation onto three different crystal structures including the
   single crystalline, polycrystalline, and nanotwinned polycrystalline
   copper. To reveal the effects of crystal structure and
   twin-lamellae-thickness on the response of nanoindentation, we evaluate
   the evolution of crystalline structure, dislocation, strain, indentation
   force, temperature, hardness, and elastic recovery coefficient in the
   deformation zone. The results of MD simulations show that the hardness,
   elastic recovery ratio and temperature of those three nanocrystalline
   copper strongly depend on crystal structure and twin-lamellae-thickness.
   It is also revealed that as nanoindenter goes deeper, the extent of
   plastic zone becomes substantially larger. Initial dislocation always
   nucleates at the beneath of indenter, and the discrete drops of
   indentation force observed at certain indentation depths, indicates
   dislocation bursts during the indentation process. In particular, the
   twining and detwining are dominant over the dislocation nucleation in
   driving plasticity in nanotwinned polycrystalline during
   nanoindentation, which are in good agreement with the previous work.
   Furthermore, we find that plastic deformation has a strong dependence on
   crystal structure. The plastic deformation of the single crystalline
   copper relies on the generation, propagation and reaction of
   dislocations, that of the polycrystalline copper depends on the
   dislocation-grain boundary (GB) interactions, and that of the
   nanotwinned polycrystalline copper relies upon the dislocation-twin
   boundary (TB) interactions as well as twining/detwining. This work not
   only provides insights into the effects of crystal structure and two
   lamellae-thickness on the mechanical properties of copper under
   nanoindentation, but also shed lights onto the guideline of
   understanding other FCC nanocrystalline materials. Crown Copyright (C)

Title = {{Jointly optimized QoS-aware virtualization and routing in software

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},

Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Software Defined Networks (SDNs) have been recognized as the
   next-generation networking paradigm that decouples the network control
   plane from the data forwarding plane. A logically centralized controller
   is responsible for all the control decisions and communication among the
   forwarding switches. However, current traffic engineering techniques and
   state-of-the-art routing algorithms do not effectively use the merits of
   SDNs, such as global centralized visibility, control and data plane
   decoupling, network management simplification and great computation
   capability. In this paper, a multi-tenancy management framework is
   proposed to enable the jointly optimized design of quality-of-services
   (QoSs)-aware virtualization and routing by tenant isolation and
   prioritization as well as flow allocation, fulfilling QoS requirements
   of tenants' applications. Specifically, a fine-grained network
   virtualization is first proposed to isolate and prioritize tenants
   through the design of network and switch hypervisors. Furthermore, a
   QoS-aware dynamic flow allocation is proposed to enable optimal flow
   routes selection upon the given network slicing with QoS provisioning.
   Finally, an adaptive feedback management tool, called QoS-aware
   Virtualization-enabled Routing (QVR), is proposed to combine
   virtualization with flow allocation and supports reliable and efficient
   transmissions with regards of time-varying QoS requirements, network
   topologies, and traffic statistics. Simulations confirm that QVR
   achieves much less shared edges, congestion latency, and traffic delay
   for multiple tenants, thus facilitating virtualization-enabled traffic
   engineering for multi-tenancy SDNs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A ball-bearing structure based triboelectric nanogenerator (B-TENG) with

Abstract = {{Being able to manipulate mass flow is critically important in a variety
   of physical processes in chemical and biomolecular science. For example,
   separation and catalytic systems, which requires precise control of mass
   diffusion, are crucial in the manufacturing of chemicals, crystal growth
   of semiconductors, waste recovery of biological solutes or chemicals,
   and production of artificial kidneys. Coordinate transformations and
   metamaterials are powerful methods to achieve precise manipulation of
   molecular diffusion. Here, we introduce a novel approach to obtain mass
   separation based on metamaterials that can sort chemical and
   biomolecular species by cloaking one compound while concentrating the
   other. A design strategy to realize such metamaterial using homogeneous
   isotropic materials is proposed. We present a practical case where a
   mixture of oxygen and nitrogen is manipulated using a metamaterial that
   cloaks nitrogen and concentrates oxygen. This work lays the foundation
   for molecular mass separation in biophysical and chemical systems

   response emphasizes the significance of cell cycle genes following
   unilateral traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Delayed or secondary cell death that is caused by a cascade
   of cellular and molecular processes initiated by traumatic brain injury
   (TBI) may be reduced or prevented if an effective neuroprotective
   strategy is employed. Microarray and subsequent bioinformatic analyses
   were used to determine which genes, pathways and networks were
   significantly altered 24 h after unilateral TBI in the rat. Ipsilateral
   hemi-brain, the corresponding contralateral hemi-brain, and naive
   (control) brain tissue were used for microarray analysis.
   Results: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed cell death and survival (CD)
   to be a top molecular and cellular function associated with TBI on both
   sides of the brain. One major finding was that the overall gene
   expression pattern suggested an increase in CD genes in ipsilateral
   brain tissue and suppression of CD genes contralateral to the injury
   which may indicate an endogenous protective mechanism. We created
   networks of genes of interest (GOI) and ranked the genes by the number
   of direct connections each had in the GOI networks, creating gene
   interaction hierarchies (GIHs). Cell cycle was determined from the
   resultant GIHs to be a significant molecular and cellular function in
   post-TBI CD gene response.
   Conclusions: Cell cycle and apoptosis signalling genes that were highly
   ranked in the GIHs and exhibited either the inverse
   ipsilateral/contralateral expression pattern or contralateral
   suppression were identified and included STAT3, CCND1, CCND2, and BAX.
   Additional exploration into the remote suppression of CD genes may
   provide insight into neuroprotective mechanisms that could be used to
   develop therapies to prevent cell death following TBI.}},

   Using this growth system, bulk homojunction films of core-shell ZnO

   oppositely doped shell. Extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   characterization showed that the nanowires remain single crystalline,
   and the previously reported signs of doping remain intact. The
   electronic properties of these films were measured, and ultraviolet
   photo detection was observed. This growth technique could serve as the

Abstract = {{Wurtzite materials exhibit both semiconductor and piezoelectric
   properties under strains due to the non-central symmetric crystal
   structures. The three-way coupling of semiconductor properties,
   piezoelectric polarization and optical excitation in ZnO, GaN, CdS and
   other piezoelectric semiconductors leads to the emerging field of
   piezo-phototronics. This effect can efficiently manipulate the emission
   intensity of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by utilizing the
   piezo-polarization charges created at the junction upon straining to
   modulate the energy band diagrams and the optoelectronic processes, such
   as generation, separation, recombination and/or transport of charge
   carriers. Starting from fundamental physics principles, recent progress
   in piezo-phototronic-effect-enhanced LEDs is reviewed; following their
   development from single-nanowire pressure-sensitive devices to
   high-resolution array matrices for pressure-distribution mapping
   applications. The piezo-phototronic effect provides a promising method
   to enhance the light emission of LEDs based on piezoelectric
   semiconductors through applying static strains, and may find perspective
   applications in various optoelectronic devices and integrated systems.}},

Abstract = {{A model of a rapid temperature swing adsorption CO, capture module using
   sorbent-loaded hollow fibers is presented. The system incorporates an
   integrated heat recovery technique using a thermal wave to reduce the
   external thermal input and operational energy costs of the capture
   facility. The model includes a detailed heat and mass transport model
   for the sorbent-loaded fibers to address accurately the rapid radial
   kinetics of the adsorption process. The local heating and cooling of the
   sorbent possible with the use of coupling fluid in the bore of the
   fibers significantly reduces the time required for each adsorbing and
   desorbing phase. Results for a representative operating condition
   indicate that a capture facility based on the sorbent-loaded hollow
   fibers can achieve significantly higher sorbent productivities (similar
   to 1400\%) than that of other thermally driven capture technologies with
   moderate energy consumption (similar to 5.9 MJ kg(-1)). The very fast
   cycle times (similar to 100 s) achievable with this adsorption process
   enable this high productivity that can substantially reduce the
   footprint of a plant-scale CO2 capture facility.}},

Abstract = {{As a novel solvent, ionic liquids have been used in a series of
   industrial fields, in which large amounts of waste ionic liquids are
   generated and need to be concentrated and recycled rather than
   discharged. The disposal of aqueous ionic liquid solutions may cause
   environmental issues due to slow degradation and toxicity.
   Electrodialysis (ED) was proposed here to concentrate dilute aqueous
   solutions of ionic liquids. The effects of the membrane types, applied
   voltage drops across the ED membrane stack and operating modes,
   including partial cyclic operation mode, and changes in the volume ratio
   of concentrated solution to dilute solution (V-c/V-d) were investigated
   systematically. Results indicate that the membrane type and operating
   voltage drop across the membrane stack were optimized as CJMC/MA
   membranes and 10 V, respectively. Also, it shows that the concentration
   efficiency of the volume ratio of 1:8 is superior to that of partial
   cyclic operation mode because high concentration ratio (4.5), low energy
   consumption (9.46 kWh/m(3)), and low water transport (10.3\%) can be
   achieved. In addition, membrane fouling was monitored, which showed that
   anion-exchange membranes were stable in the concentrating process.
   Nevertheless, the absorption of foulants on the membrane surface has
   some effect on the concentrating process, which should be overcome in
   industrial application. Overall, the ED process is a feasible technology
   to concentrate and recycle waste ionic liquids.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallization kinetics of ampicillin were estimated from
   induction-times and seeded and unseeded experiments. The concentration
   of ampicillin in solution was monitored by polarimetry and

   measurements and light microscopy. Variations of solute concentration
   with time, along with measured induction times were used to estimate
   parameters in kinetic expressions for primary nucleation, secondary
   nucleation, and crystal growth rate. Experimental data were obtained in
   runs involving different rates of change of pH, mass of seed crystals,
   and initial supersaturation. These data were used in
   parameter-estimation routines consisting of a stochastic minimization to
   localize a set of parameters spanning all the experiments, followed by a
   deterministic minimization to refine the parameters. The result was a
   set of parameters that fit a range of conditions of seeded and unseeded
   crystallizations and gave good estimates of desupersaturation rates.}},

Abstract = {{The Li-binding thermodynamics and redox potentials of seven different
   quinone derivatives are investigated to determine their suitability as
   positive electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. First, using
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the interactions between
   the quinone derivatives and Li atoms, we find that the Li atoms
   primarily bind with the carbonyl groups in the test molecules. Next, we
   observed that the redox properties of the quinone derivatives can be
   tuned in the desired direction by systematically modifying their
   chemical structures using electron-withdrawing functional groups.
   Further, DFT-based investigations of the redox potentials of the
   Li-bound quinone derivatives provide insights regarding the changes
   induced in their redox properties during the discharging process. The
   redox potential decreases as the number of bound Li atoms is increased.
   However, we found that the functionalization of the quinone derivatives
   with carboxylic acids can improve their redox potential as well as their
   charge capacity. Through this study, we also determined that the
   cathodic activity of quinone derivatives during the discharging process
   relies strongly on the solvation effect as well as on the number of
   carbonyl groups available for further Li binding.}},

Abstract = {{The use of seed-mediated growth as a versatile approach to the synthesis
   of penta-twinned Cu nanorods with uniform diameters and controllable
   aspect ratios is reported. The success of this approach relies on our
   recent synthesis of uniform Pd decahedra, with sizes in the range of
   6-20 nm. The Pd decahedral seeds can direct the heterogeneous nucleation
   and growth of Cu along the fivefold axis to produce nanorods with
   uniform diameters defined by the lateral dimension of the original
   seeds. Due to a large mismatch in the lattice constants between Cu and
   Pd (7.1\%), the deposited Cu is forced to grow along one side of the Pd
   decahedral seed, generating a nanorod with an asymmetric distribution of
   Cu, with the Pd seed situated at one of the two ends. According to
   extinction spectra, the as-obtained Cu nanorods can be stored in water
   under the ambient conditions for at least six months without noticeable
   degradation. This excellent stability allows us to systematically
   investigate the size-dependent surface plasmon resonance properties of
   the penta-twinned Cu nanorods. With the nanorod transverse modes
   positioned at 560 nm, the longitudinal modes can be readily tuned from
   the visible to the near-infrared region by controlling the aspect ratio.}},

Pages = {{1049-1057}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the miniaturization of power electronics and the development of
   portable and flexible devices, demands for highly thermally conductive,
   mechanically flexible, and electrically insulating composites have
   substantially increased. However, the conventional method to improve
   thermal conductivity usually yields both an undesired value (usually
   below 10 W m(-1) K-1) and poor flexibility. Thus, a combination of all
   the desired properties together remains a technical challenge.
   Bioinspired engineering offers great promise in the synthesis and
   fabrication of thermal materials that are different from engineering
   through conventional approaches. Inspired by the interface and
   orientation of natural nacre, we report on thermally conductive and
   mechanically flexible papers based on boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs)
   and graphene oxide (GO) via a simple vacuum-assisted filtration process.
   We experimentally show that the papers possess high thermal conductivity
   of 29.8 W m(-1) K-1, excellent mechanical flexibility, and satisfactory
   electrical insulation. We attribute the high thermal conductivity to the
   well-designed BNNS-GO interface as well as the advantageous orientation
   in layered structure. This approach to constructing thermally conductive
   composites provides a creative opportunity for design and fabrication of
   high-performance materials in the near future, and this kind of paper
   has great potential application in next-generation commercial portable
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{An inverse relationship between mechanical ductility and
   mobility/molecular ordering in conjugated polymer systems was determined
   definitively through systematic interrogation of poly(3-hexylthiophene)

   required for efficient charge transport conclusively undermines the
   applicability of these materials for stretchable, flexible device
   applications, was resolved using a polymer blend approach. Specifically,
   the molecular interactions between dissimilar polymer materials
   advantageously induced semiconducting polymer ordering into efficient
   pi-pi stacked fibrillar networks. Changes in the molecular environment
   surrounding the conjugated polymer during the elastomer curing process
   further facilitated development of high mobility networked semiconductor
   pathways. A processed P3HT: poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) composite
   afforded a semiconducting film that exhibits superior ductility and

   cell in which the particle resides. These vectors tend to point in
   toward regions of high free volume and away from regions of low free
   volume, reminiscent of sinks and sources in a vector field. We compute
   the local divergence of these vectors, where positive values correspond
   to overpacked regions and negative values identify underpacked regions
   within the material. Distributions of this divergence are nearly
   Gaussian with zero mean, allowing for structural characterization using
   only the moments of the distribution. We explore how the standard
   deviation and skewness vary with the packing fraction for simulations of
   bidisperse systems and find a kink in these moments that coincides with
   the jamming transition.}},

Abstract = {{Leukocytes normally marginate toward the vascular wall in large vessels
   and within the microvasculature. Reversal of this process, leukocyte
   demargination, leads to substantial increases in the clinical white
   blood cell and granulocyte count and is a well-documented effect of
   glucocorticoid and catecholamine hormones, although the underlying
   mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that alterations in granulocyte
   mechanical properties are the driving force behind glucocorticoid-and
   catecholamine-induced demargination. First, we found that the
   proportions of granulocytes from healthy human subjects that traversed
   and demarginated from microfluidic models of capillary beds and veins,
   respectively, increased after the subjects ingested glucocorticoids.
   Also, we show that glucocorticoid and catecholamine exposure reorganizes
   cellular cortical actin, significantly reducing granulocyte stiffness,
   as measured with atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, using simple
   kinetic theory computational modeling, we found that this reduction in
   stiffness alone is sufficient to cause granulocyte demargination. Taken
   together, our findings reveal a biomechanical answer to an old
   hematologic question regarding how glucocorticoids and catecholamines
   cause leukocyte demargination. In addition, in a broader sense, we have
   discovered a temporally and energetically efficient mechanism in which
   the innate immune system can simply alter leukocyte stiffness to fine
   tune margination/demargination and therefore leukocyte trafficking in
   general. These observations have broad clinically relevant implications
   for the inflammatory process overall as well as hematopoietic stem cell
   mobilization and homing.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted in situ three-point bending experiments on beams with
   roughly square cross-sections, which we fabricated from the frustule of
   Coscinodiscus sp. We observe failure by brittle fracture at an average
   stress of 1.1 GPa. Analysis of crack propagation and shell morphology
   reveals a differentiation in the function of the frustule layers with
   the basal layer pores, which deflect crack propagation. We calculated
   the relative density of the frustule to be similar to 30\% and show that
   at this density the frustule has the highest strength-to-density ratio
   of 1,702 kN.m/kg, a significant departure from all reported biologic
   materials. We also performed nanoindentation on both the single basal
   layer of the frustule as well as the girdle band and show that these
   components display similar mechanical properties that also agree well
   with bending tests. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals
   that the frustule is made almost entirely of amorphous silica with a
   nanocrystalline proximal layer. No flaws are observed within the
   frustule material down to 2 nm. Finite element simulations of the
   three-point bending experiments show that the basal layer carries most
   of the applied load whereas stresses within the cribrum and areolae
   layer are an order of magnitude lower. These results demonstrate the
   natural development of architecture in live organisms to simultaneously
   achieve light weight, strength, and exceptional structural integrity and
   may provide insight into evolutionary design.}},

   microscale active metasurface}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Surface acoustic waves propagating over an immersed membrane
   metasurface, such as an array of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducers, can be leveraged to achieve subwavelength focusing and
   imaging. This is demonstrated numerically and experimentally utilizing a
   time reversal method on a 2D membrane array at MHz frequencies. The
   focusing region is a dense metasurface of CMUT membranes with 6.5 MHz
   resonance frequency that supports a wave field that is evanescent normal
   to the metasurface and capable of super-resolution along the
   metasurface. Electrostatically actuated membranes, spatially separate
   from the focusing region, are used to generate the focused wave field.
   Subwavelength focusing is demonstrated on the metasurface with a
   resolution of a single membrane resonator or lambda\textbackslash{}/5.
   Similar techniques allow for super-resolution imaging of a subwavelength
   defect or change in the medium of the focusing region. A subwavelength
   sized imaging target, obtained by altering the stiffness of a single
   membrane by 1.2\%, is shown to be properly imaged with subwavelength
   resolution. These results pave the way for practical implementation of
   ultrasonic super-resolution imaging systems using metasurfaces. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Hydrogen embrittlement of metals is widely observed, but its atomistic
   origins remain little understood and much debated. Combining a unique
   identification of interstitial sites through polyhedral tessellation and
   first-principles calculations, we study hydrogen adsorption at grain
   boundaries in a variety of face-centered cubic metals of Ni, Cu,
   gamma-Fe, and Pd. We discover the chemomechanical origin of the
   variation of adsorption energetics for interstitial hydrogen at grain
   boundaries. A general chemomechanical formula is established to provide
   accurate assessments of hydrogen trapping and segregation energetics at
   grain boundaries, and it also offers direct explanations for certain
   experimental observations. The present study deepens our mechanistic
   understanding of the role of grain boundaries in hydrogen embrittlement
   and points to a viable path towards predictive microstructure
   engineering against hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals.}},

Abstract = {{XPG is a structure-specific endonuclease required for nucleotide
   excision repair, and incision-defective XPG mutations cause the skin
   cancer-prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum. Truncating mutations
   instead cause the neurodevelopmental progeroid disorder Cockayne
   syndrome, but little is known about how XPG loss results in this
   devastating disease. We identify XPG as a partner of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in
   maintaining genomic stability through homologous recombination (HRR).
   XPG depletion causes DNA double-strand breaks, chromosomal
   abnormalities, cell-cycle delays, defective HRR, inability to overcome
   replication fork stalling, and replication stress. XPG directly
   interacts with BRCA2, RAD51, and PALB2, and XPG depletion reduces their
   chromatin binding and subsequent RAD51 foci formation. Upstream in HRR,
   XPG interacts directly with BRCA1. Its depletion causes BRCA1
   hyper-phosphorylation and persistent chromatin binding. These unexpected
   findings establish XPG as an HRR protein with important roles in genome
   stability and suggest how XPG defects produce severe clinical
   consequences including cancer and accelerated aging.}},

Title = {{Facile Synthesis of a 3D Nanoarchitectured Li4Ti5O12 Electrode for
   Ultrafast Energy Storage}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Despite enormous efforts devoted to the development of high-performance
   batteries, the obtainable energy and power density, durability, and
   affordability of the existing batteries are still inadequate for many
   applications. Here, a self-standing nanostructured electrode with
   ultrafast cycling capability is reported by in situ tailoring Li4Ti5O12
   nanocrystals into a 3D carbon current collector (derived from filter
   paper) through a facile wet chemical process involving adsorption of
   titanium source, boiling treatment, and subsequent chemical lithiation.
   This 3D architectural electrode is charged/discharged to approximate to
   60\% of the theoretical capacity of Li4Ti5O12 in approximate to 21 s at
   100 C rate (17 500 mA g(-1) ), which also shows stable cycling
   performance for 1000 cycles at a cycling rate of 50 C. Additionally,
   modified 3D carbon current collector with much smaller pores and finer
   fiber diameters are further used, which significantly improve the
   specific capacity based on the weight of the entire electrode. These
   novel electrodes are promising for high-power applications such as
   electric vehicles and smart grids. This unique electrode architecture
   also simplifies the electrode fabrication process and significantly
   enhances current collection efficiency (especially at high rate).
   Further, the conceptual electrode design is applicable to other oxide
   electrode materials for high-performance batteries, fuel cells, and
   supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV gp41 is an
   established target of antibodies that neutralize a broad range of HIV
   isolates. To evaluate the role of the transmembrane (TM) domain,
   synthetic MPER-derived peptides were incorporated into lipid
   nanoparticles using natural and designed TM domains, and antibody
   affinity was measured using immobilized and solution-based techniques.
   Peptides incorporating the native HIV TM domain exhibit significantly
   stronger interactions with neutralizing antibodies than peptides with a
   monomeric TM domain. Furthermore, a peptide with a trimeric, three-helix
   bundle TM domain recapitulates the binding profile of the native
   sequence. These studies suggest that neutralizing antibodies can bind
   the MPER when the TM domain is a three-helix bundle and this
   presentation could influence the binding of neutralizing antibodies to
   the virus. Lipid-bilayer presentation of viral antigens in Nanodiscs is
   a new platform for evaluating neutralizing antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{Lycopene, a compound that blocks the action of free radicals and oxygen
   molecules, is found in tomatoes and tomato-based products and linked to
   a reduced incidence of cancer. Increasing willingness of patients to
   maintain a healthy lifestyle by supplemental intake of nutrients and
   acceptance of alternative therapeutics has boosted research into
   nutraceuticals. The potential of lycopene to prevent or treat cancer has
   been investigated, but outcomes are inconsistent and its mode of action
   is still unknown. Further studies are needed to understand the role of
   lycopene in cancer prevention and treatment. The impact of lycopene on
   viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of five different
   cancer cell lines was determined using monolayer and spheroid cultures.
   Cell viability was significantly reduced upon lycopene treatment at
   physiologically attainable concentrations. Cell proliferation,
   migration, and invasion did not change upon lycopene treatment. Ovarian
   cancer spheroids initially showed a decreased proliferation and after
   14days increased cell viability upon lycopene treatment, confirming the
   potential of lycopene to reduce cancer cell growth in short-term
   cultures and also indicate enhanced cell viability over prolonged
   exposure. This study cannot substantiate that lycopene inhibits cell
   functions associated with tumor growth, even in a 3D cancer model that
   mimics the natural tumor microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the fabrication of novel functional gel coatings with
   randomized physical and chemical patterns that enable dual encoding
   ability to realize unclonable optical tags. This design is based on
   swelling-mediated massive reconstruction of an ultrathin responsive
   gelatinous polymer film uniformly adsorbed with plasmonic nanostructures
   into a randomized network of interacting folds, resulting in bright
   electromagnetic hotspots within the folds. We reveal a strong
   correlation between the topology and near-field electromagnetic field
   enhancement due to the intimate contact between two plasmonic surfaces
   within the folds, each of them representing a unique combination of
   local topography and chemical distribution caused by the formation of
   electromagnetic hotspots. Because of the efficient trapping of the Raman
   reporters within the uniquely distributed electromagnetic hotspots, the
   surface enhanced Raman scattering enhancement from the morphed plasmonic
   gel was found to be nearly 40 times higher compared to that from the
   pristine plasmonic gel. Harnessing the nondeterministic nature of the
   folds, the folded plasmonic gel can be employed as a multidimensional
   (with dual topo-chemical encoding) optical taggant for prospective
   anticounterfeiting applications. Such novel optical tags based on the
   spontaneous folding process are virtually impossible to replicate
   because of the combination of nondeterministic physical patterns and
   chemical encoding.}},

Abstract = {{Precise control over surface functionalities of nanomaterials offers
   great opportunities for fabricating complex functional nanoarchitectures
   but still remains challenging. In this work, we successfully developed a
   novel strategy to modify a gold nanorod (AuNR) with specific surface
   recognition sites using a DNA origami clamp. AuNRs were encapsulated by
   the DNA origami through hybridization of single-stranded DNA on the
   AuNRs and complementary capture strands inside the clamp. Another set of
   capture strands on the outside of the clamp create the specific
   recognition sites on the AuNR surface. By means of this strategy, AuNRs
   were site specifically modified with gold nanoparticles at the top,
   middle, and bottom of the surface, respectively, to construct a series
   of well-defined heterostructures with controlled ``chemical valence{''}.
   Our study greatly expands the utility of DNA origami as a tool for
   building complex nanoarchitectures and represents a new approach for
   precise tailoring of nanomaterial surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In a classic example of stability from instability, we show that Li2OHCl
   solid electrolyte forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
   layer with a metallic lithium anode. The Li2OHCl solid electrolyte can
   be readily achieved through simple mixing of LiOH and LiCl precursors at
   a mild processing temperature <400 degrees C. Additionally, we show that
   continuous, dense Li2OHCl membranes can be fabricated at temperatures
   <400 degrees C, standing in great contrast to current processing
   temperatures of >1600 degrees C for most oxide-based solid electrolytes.
   The ionic conductivity and Arrhenius activation energy were explored for
   the LiOH-LiCl system of crystalline solid electrolytes, where Li2OHCl
   with increased crystal defects was found to have the highest ionic
   conductivity and reasonable Arrhenius activation energy. The Li2OHCl
   solid electrolyte displays stability against metallic lithium, even in
   extreme conditions past the melting point of lithium metal. To
   understand this excellent stability, we show that SEI formation is
   critical in stabilizing the interface between metallic lithium and the
   Li2OHCl solid electrolyte.}},

Title = {{CSF complement 3 and factor H are staging biomarkers in Alzheimer's
   disease}},
Journal = {{ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: CSF levels of established Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   biomarkers remain stable despite disease progression, and non-amyloid
   non-tau biomarkers have the potential of informing disease stage and
   progression. We previously identified complement 3 (C3) to be decreased
   in AD dementia, but this change was not found by others in earlier AD
   stages. We hypothesized that levels of C3 and associated factor H (FH)
   can potentially distinguish between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
   dementia stages of AD, but we also found their levels to be influenced
   by age and disease status.
   Results: We developed a biochemical/bioinformatics pipeline to optimize
   the handling of complex interactions between variables in validating
   biochemical markers of disease. We used data from the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuro-imaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 230) to build parallel
   machine learning models, and objectively tested the models in a test
   cohort (n = 73) of MCI and mild AD patients independently recruited from
   Emory University. Whereas models incorporating age, gender, APOE epsilon
   4 status, and CSF amyloid and tau levels failed to reliably distinguish
   between MCI and mild AD in ADNI, introduction of CSF C3 and FH levels
   reproducibly improved the distinction between the two AD stages in ADNI
   (p < 0.05) and the Emory cohort (p = 0.014). Within each AD stage, the
   final model also distinguished between fast vs. slower decliners (p <
   0.001 for MCI, p = 0.007 for mild AD), with lower C3 and FH levels
   associated with more advanced disease and faster progression.
   Conclusions: We propose that CSF C3 and FH alterations may reflect
   stage-associated biomarker changes in AD, and can complement clinician
   diagnosis in diagnosing and staging AD using the publically available
   ADNI database as reference.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous sub-cellular through system-level disturbances have been
   identified in over 1300 articles examining the superoxide dismutase-1
   guanine 93 to alanine (SOD1-G93A) transgenic mouse amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology. Manual assessment of such a broad
   literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive
   informatics-based systematic review or field analysis' to agnostically
   compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of
   recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth
   and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological
   function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the
   field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of
   primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an
   motor function, 59\%; inflammation, 46\%; cellular energetics, 37\%;
   proteomics, 31\%; neural excitability, 22\%; apoptosis, 20\%; oxidative
   stress, 18\%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14\%; axonal transport, 10\%.
   We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and
   categorizes the 85\% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we
   present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms
   and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles
   individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the
   numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential
   future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological
   interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation
   and disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metals contained in wastewater are one of the most serious
   pollutions in natural resources. A self-powered electrochemical recovery
   system for collecting Cu ions in wastewater by incorporating a rolling
   friction enhanced freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF-TENG) is
   developed here. The RF-TENG utilizes integrated cylindrical surfaces
   using the conjunction of rolling electrification and freestanding
   electrostatic induction, which shows outstanding output performance and
   ultrarobust stability. By using the kinetic energy of flowing water, a
   collection efficiency of up to 80\% for Cu2+ ions in wastewater has been
   achieved. Self-powered electrochemical systems are one of the most
   promising applications of TENGs for independent and sustainable driving
   of electrochemical reactions without the need for any additional power
   supply. This research is a substantial advancement towards the practical
   applications of triboelectric nanogenerators and self-powered
   electrochemical systems.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) are a possible power source for
   wearable electronics, but the conventional electrode materials for TENG
   are metals such as Cu and Al that are easy to be oxidized or corroded in
   some harsh environments. In this paper, metal electrode material is
   replaced by an electrical conducting polymer, polypyrrole (PPy), for the
   first time. Moreover, by utilizing PPy with micro/nanostructured surface
   as the triboelectric layer, the charge density generated is
   significantly improved, more superior to that of TENG with metals as the
   triboelectric layer. As this polymer-based TENG is further integrated
   with PPy-based supercapacitors, an all-plastic-materials based
   self-charging power system is built to provide sustainable power with
   excellent long cycling life. Since the environmental friendly materials
   are adopted and the facile electrochemical deposition technique is
   applied, the new self-charging power system can be a practical and low
   cost power solution for many applications.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{The effects of flow and particle properties on margination of particles
   in red blood cell (RBC) suspensions is investigated using direct
   numerical simulation (DNS) of cellar blood flow. We focus on margination
   of particles in the flow of moderately dense suspensions of RBCs. We
   hypothesize that margination rate in nondilute suspensions is mainly
   driven by the RBC-enhanced diffusion of marginating particles in the
   RBC-filled region. We derive a scaling law for margination length in a
   straight channel. Margination length increases cubically with channel
   height and is independent of shear rate. We verify this scaling law for
   margination length by DNS of flowing RBCs and marginating particles. We
   also show that rigidity and size both lead to particle margination with
   rigidity having a more significant effect compared to size within the
   range of parameters in this study.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The universality of the scaling laws that correlate the hydrodynamic
   slip length and static contact angle was investigated by introducing the
   concept of the wettability transparency of graphene-coated surfaces.
   Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of droplet wettability for
   Si(111), Si(100), and graphene-coated silicon surfaces were performed to
   determine the conditions required to obtain similar contact angles
   between bare and graphene-coated surfaces (wettability transparency).
   The hydrodynamic slip length was determined by means of equilibrium
   calculations for silicon and graphene-coated silicon nanochannels. The
   results indicate that the slip-wettability scaling laws can be used to
   describe the slip behavior of the bare silicon nanochannels in general
   terms; however, clear departures from a general universal description
   were observed for hydrophobic conditions. In addition, a significant
   difference in the hydrodynamic slippage was observed under wettability
   transparency conditions. Alternatively, the hydrodynamic boundary
   condition for silicon and graphene-coated silicon nanochannels was more
   accurately predicted by observing the density depletion length, posing
   this parameter as a better alternative than the contact angle to
   correlate with the slip length. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{25-34}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The present work combines orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and
   visco-plastic self-consistent framework based numerical simulation to
   study evolution of microstructure and crystallographic texture during
   indentation of copper. It was seen that anomalous microstructure
   evolution characteristics involving accelerated grain fragmentation and
   refinement resulted in ultra-fine grains at low equivalent strains
   within a zone close to the interface of the indenter. Sources of
   acceleration in refinement were found in enhanced local crystallographic
   rotation rates manifesting through micro-scale strain-path changes in
   pathlines leading into the zone near the interface. These strain path
   changes were shown to result from heterogeneous accommodation of
   deformation across mechanically harder/softer micro zones prevalent in
   copper despite absence of a harder second phase. The micro-zones were
   recognized using Taylor factor analysis by coupling in-situ
   characterization of deformation fields with DIM. In addition to
   accelerated refinement, zones near the interface of the indenter also
   exhibited cube textures as opposed to shear-type textures elsewhere in
   the specimen, confirming a hitherto unknown heterogeneity in the
   geometry of deformation mechanics imposed during indentation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Terahertz band communication is envisioned as a key technology to
   satisfy the increasing demand for ultra-high-speed wireless links. In
   this paper, a multi-wideband waveform design for the THz band is
   proposed, by exploiting the channel peculiarities including the
   distance-varying spectral windows, the delay spread and the temporal
   broadening effects. This scheme allows the dynamical variation of the
   rate and the transmit power on each sub-window and improves the
   distance. Moreover, the closed-form expressions of the
   signal-to-interference-plus-the-noise and bit-error-rate for the
   multi-wideband waveform are derived, by considering the inter-symbol and
   inter-band interferences. Then, an optimization framework is formulated
   to solve for the multi-wideband waveform design parameters of the
   transmit power and the number of frames, with the aim to maximize the
   communication distance while satisfying the rate and the transmit power
   constraints. Four sub-optimal solutions are proposed and compared. The
   results show that the SINR increases with the transmit power and the
   number of frames, at the cost of the power consumption and the rate
   decrease. With the transmit power of 10 dBm, the largest distance to
   support 10 Gbps for the multi-path propagation is 4 m, which is realized
   via the power allocation scheme to minimize the power/bit on each
   sub-window and is 10\% improvement over the fixed scheme. However, for
   the directional transmission, this scheme under-exploits the transmit
   power severely. Instead, the allocation scheme that minimizes the number
   of frames outperforms the other three schemes. In terms of the maximum
   distance that achieves 30 Gbps, this scheme reaches 22.5 m.}},

Abstract = {{We present a real-space formulation and higher-order finite-difference
   implementation of periodic Orbital-free Density Functional Theory
   (OF-DFT). Specifically, utilizing a local reformulation of the
   electrostatic and kernel terms, we develop a generalized framework for
   performing OF-DFT simulations with different variants of the electronic
   kinetic energy. In particular, we propose a self-consistent field (SCF)
   type fixed-point method for calculations involving linear-response
   kinetic energy functionals. In this framework, evaluation of both the
   electronic ground-state and forces on the nuclei are amenable to
   computations that scale linearly with the number of atoms. We develop a
   parallel implementation of this formulation using the finite-difference
   discretization. We demonstrate that higher-order finite-differences can
   achieve relatively large convergence rates with respect to mesh-size in
   both the energies and forces. Additionally, we establish that the
   fixed-point iteration converges rapidly, and that it can be further
   accelerated using extrapolation techniques like Anderson's mixing. We
   validate the accuracy of the results by comparing the energies and
   forces with plane-wave methods for selected examples, including the
   vacancy formation energy in Aluminum. Overall, the suitability of the
   proposed formulation for scalable high performance computing makes it an
   attractive choice for large-scale OF-DFT calculations consisting of
   thousands of atoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Charge transfer is important for the performance of a
   photoelectrochemical cell. Understanding photogenerated charge
   accumulation and separation is mandatory for the design and optimisation
   of photoelectrochemical cells. Unique stacked and embedded
   heterostructure of Sb2S3/TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) was fabricated
   through anodic oxidation with the hydrothermal method. Surface
   photovoltage spectroscopy, phase spectra and photoluminescence
   measurements were performed to explore the mechanism by which the
   inorganic hole transport material CuI affects the charge transfer and
   photoelectrochemical properties of Sb2S3/TiO2 heterostructure NTAs. The
   interfacial separation and transport of photoinduced charge carriers
   were also examined by applying current-voltage characteristics (J-V),
   incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and
   Mott-Schottky techniques. Results show that CuI acts not only as a
   hole-conducting and electron-blocking material but also as a
   light-absorbing material in the ultraviolet range. Efficient charge
   transfer processes exist in CuI/Sb2S3/TiO2 heterostructure NTAs. The
   photoelectrochemical performance of CuI/Sb2S3/TiO2 heterostructure NTAs
   is dramatically improved. Under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW/cm(2),
   the short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage are 3.51
   mA/cm(2) and 0.87 V, respectively. The photoelectric conversion
   efficiency of CuI/Sb2S3/TiO2 heterostructure NTAs (0.95\%) is 36\%
   higher than that of Sb2S3/TiO2 heterostructure NTAs (0.66\%). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Biomass derived carbon materials have been widely used as electrode
   materials; however, in most cases, only electrical double layer
   capacitance (EDLC) is utilized and therefore, only low energy density
   can be achieved. Herein, we report on redox-active carbon spheres that
   can be simply synthesized from earth-abundant glucose via a hydrothermal
   process. These carbon spheres exhibit a specific capacity of similar to
   210 mA h g(CS)(-1), with high redox potentials in the voltage range of
   2.2-3.7 V vs. Li, when used as positive electrode in lithium cells.
   Free-standing, flexible composite films consisting of the carbon spheres
   and few-walled carbon nanotubes deliver high specific capacities up to
   similar to 155 mA h g(electrode)(-1) with no obvious capacity fading up
   to 10 000 cycles, proposing to be promising positive electrodes for
   lithium-ion batteries or capacitors. Furthermore, considering that the
   carbon spheres were obtained in an aqueous glucose solution and no toxic
   or hazardous reagents were used, this process opens up a green and
   sustainable method for designing high performance,
   environmentally-friendly energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric materials are strategically valuable for sustainable
   development, as they allow for the generation of electrical energy from
   wasted heat. In recent years several strategies have demonstrated some
   efficiency in improving thermoelectric properties. Dopants affect
   carrier concentration, while thermal conductivity can be influenced by
   alloying and nanostructuring. Features at the nanoscale positively
   contribute to scattering phonons, however those with long mean free
   paths remain difficult to alter. Here we use the concept of hierarchical
   nano-grains to demonstrate thermal conductivity reduction in rocksalt
   lead chalcogenides. We demonstrate that grains can be obtained by taking
   advantage of the reconstructions along the phase transition path that
   connects the rocksalt structure to its high-pressure form. Since grain
   features naturally change as a function of size, they impact thermal
   conductivity over different length scales. To understand this effect we
   use a combination of advanced molecular dynamics techniques to engineer
   grains and to evaluate thermal conductivity in PbSe. By affecting grain
   morphologies only, i.e. at constant chemistry, two distinct effects
   emerge: the lattice thermal conductivity is significantly lowered with
   respect to the perfect crystal, and its temperature dependence is
   markedly suppressed. This is due to an increased scattering of
   low-frequency phonons by grain boundaries over different size scales.
   Along this line we propose a viable process to produce hierarchical
   thermoelectric materials by applying pressure via a mechanical load or a
   shockwave as a novel paradigm for material design.}},

Title = {{An integrated platform for large-scale data collection and precise
   perturbation of live Drosophila embryos}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the fundamental principles governing embryogenesis is a
   key goal of developmental biology. Direct observation of embryogenesis
   via in vivo live imaging is vital to understanding embryogenesis; yet,
   tedious sample preparation makes it difficult to acquire large-scale
   imaging data that is often required to overcome experimental and
   biological noises for quantitative studies. Furthermore, it is often
   difficult, and sometimes impossible, to incorporate environmental
   perturbation for understanding developmental responses to external
   stimuli. To address this issue, we have developed a method for
   high-throughput imaging of live embryos, delivering precise
   environmental perturbations, and unbiased data extraction. This platform
   includes an optimized microfluidic device specifically for live embryos
   and also for precise perturbations in the microenvironment of the
   developing embryos. In addition, we developed software for simple, yet
   accurate, automated segmentation of fluorescent images, and automated
   data extraction. Using a quantitative assessment we find that embryos
   develop normally within the microfluidic device. Finally, we show an
   application of the high-throughput assay for monitoring developmental
   responses to external stimuli: anoxia-induced developmental arrest in
   Drosophila embryos. With slight modifications, the method developed in
   this work can be applied to many other models of development and other
   stimulus-response behaviors during development.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of parameters in even moderately large biological systems

   conditions, the first phase of DFE yields numerical representations of
   all fluxes within a metabolic pathway system, either as values at each
   time point or as plots against their substrates and modulators. However,
   this numerical result does not reveal the mathematical format of each
   flux. Thus, the second phase of DFE selects functional formats that are
   consistent with the numerical trends obtained from the first phase.
   While greatly facilitating metabolic data analysis, DFE is only directly
   applicable if the pathway system contains as many dependent variables as
   fluxes. Because most actual systems contain more fluxes than metabolite
   pools, this requirement is seldom satisfied. Auxiliary methods have been
   proposed to alleviate this issue, but they are not general. Here we
   propose strategies that extend DFE toward general, slightly
   underdetermined pathway systems.}},

Abstract = {{Battery electrodes are complex mesoscale systems comprised of
   electroactive components, conductive additives, and binders. In this
   report, methods for processing electrodes with dispersion of the
   components are described. To investigate the degree of material
   dispersion, a spin-coating technique was adopted to provide a thin,
   uniform layer that enabled observation of the morphology. Distinct
   differences in the distribution profile of the electrode components
   arising from individual materials physical affinities were readily
   identified. Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) analysis revealed
   pertinent surface interactions associated with materials dispersivity.
   Further studies demonstrated that HSPs can provide an effective strategy
   to identify surface modification approaches for improved dispersions of
   battery electrode materials. Specifically, introduction of
   surfactantlike functionality such as oleic acid (OA) capping and
   P3HT-conjugated polymer wrapping on the surface of nanomaterials
   significantly enhanced material dispersity over the composite electrode.
   The approach to the surface treatment on the basis of HSP study can
   facilitate design of composite electrodes with uniformly dispersed
   morphology and may contribute to enhancing their electrical and
   electrochemical behaviors. The conductivity of the composites and their
   electrochemical performance was also characterized. The study
   illustrates the importance of considering electronic conductivity,
   electron transfer, and ion transport in the design of environments
   incorporating active nanomaterials.}},

   Rather than developing a crystallization model within the

   machine-learning technique to identify an empirical model from
   measurement data. The model is low-dimensional and can therefore be
   discretized and used with dynamic programming to obtain optimal control

   prespecified batch run times. Experimental results are reported that
   demonstrate the use of the identified policies to produce crystals of

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{267-274}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{With excellent reinforcing performance and many remarkable inherent
   properties, such as renewability and high strength-per-unit-mass, chitin
   nanofibers (ChNFs) are attractive resources for polymer composite
   applications. However, significant challenges resulting from chitin's
   insolubility have hindered efforts to incorporate it effectively into
   polymer matrices. Here, ChNFs extracted from crab shells were used as
   fillers to reinforce polyethylene oxide (PEO). The dispersion of ChNFs
   in the polymer matrix and the interactions between fiber and matrix were
   studied by utilizing solvent-etching of the polymer matrix, FTIR
   spectroscopy and AFM colloidal probe adhesion measurements. The results
   show that the ChNFs were dispersed well and formed a fine interconnected
   network structure in the PEO matrix. ChNFs also exhibited strong
   adhesion with PEO, resulting from hydrogen bond and van der Waals
   forces. The ChNF interconnected network greatly enhanced the mechanical
   properties of PEO, with a 3-fold increase in both the tensile strength
   and elastic modulus of the nanocomposites at 20\% ChNF loading.
   Processing ChNFs in suspensions with slight acidity and water-soluble
   polymers appears to support the formation of highly interconnected
   networks that makes ChNF-polymer composites excellent candidates for
   reinforced, light-weight, renewable materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Melanoma growth effects on molecular clearance from tumors and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{223}},

Abstract = {{Factors produced within or administered directly into the tumor
   interstitium, such as cytokines, chemokines, proteases, exosomes,
   microvesicles, or therapeutic agents, play important and multifaceted
   roles in the regulation of malignant disease progression. Their
   bioavailability to mediate signaling in distributed tissues outside of
   the tumor microenvironment, however, has not been well described. We
   therefore sought to elucidate the relative extent to which factors from
   within the primary tumor disseminate to systemic tissues as well as how
   these distribution profiles are influenced by both hydrodynamic size and
   the remodeling tumor vasculature. To accomplish this goal, we
   intratumorally co-infused into the dermal lesions of B16F10
   melanoma-bearing mice at prescribed times post tumor implantation a near
   infrared fluorescent tracer panel ranging from 5 to 500 nm in
   hydrodynamic diameter and compared the in vivo clearance and
   biodistribution profiles to that of naive animals. Our results indicate
   that tumor growth reduces tumor-draining lymph node accumulation and
   alters the distribution of tumor-derived factors amongst systemic
   tissues. Despite these changes, previously developed principles of
   size-dependent lymph node drug targeting are conserved in melanomas,
   suggesting their applicability to sentinel lymph node-targeted drug
   delivery. Tumor progression was also found to result in a significant
   increase in the hydrodynamic size of factors originating from the tumor
   that accumulated within systemic tissues. This suggests that tumor
   vascular remodeling may redirect the organism-wide signaling activity of
   tumor-derived factors and may negatively contribute to disease
   progression by altering the bioavailability of molecules important to
   the regulation of pre-metastatic niche formation and the induction of
   anti-tumor immunity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a novel approach to realizing programmable encapsulation and
   following release of different compounds in a sequential way from
   multicompartmental microcapsules assembled from preformed polymersomes.
   The polymersomes, or polymeric vesicles, are formed through
   electrostatic interactions between a cationic miktoarm star polymer,
   namely poly(ethylene oxide)(113)-(quaternized
   poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)(60))(4), and a linear anionic
   polyelectrolyte, (poly(styrenesulfonate)(20)), and then used as the main
   component to fabricate microcapsules with tannic acid via
   hydrogen-bonded layer-by-layer assembly. The hydrogen bonding between
   tannic acid and polymersomes is sensitive to external pH, and the
   structure of the polymersomes strongly depends on the ionic strength of
   the surrounding media. This combination facilitates dual-responsive
   behavior of these multicompartmental polymersome-based microcapsules
   with the programmable release of two different types of encapsulated
   molecules (anionic and cationic molecules) from core and shell regions
   of the microcapsules independently. The integration of responsive
   nanocarriers into functional microcapsules provides a new way to
   fabricate multiresponsive hierarchical microstructures with programmed
   sequential release of different molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Speciated particle-phase organic nitrates (pONs) were quantified using
   online chemical ionization MS during June and July of 2013 in rural
   Alabama as part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study. A large
   fraction of pONs is highly functionalized, possessing between six and
   eight oxygen atoms within each carbon number group, and is not the
   common first generation alkyl nitrates previously reported. Using
   calibrations for isoprene hydroxynitrates and the measured molecular
   compositions, we estimate that pONs account for 3\% and 8\% of total
   submicrometer organic aerosol mass, on average, during the day and
   night, respectively. Each of the isoprene-and monoterpenes-derived
   groups exhibited a strong diel trend consistent with the emission
   patterns of likely biogenic hydrocarbon precursors. An observationally
   constrained diel box model can replicate the observed pON assuming that
   pONs (i) are produced in the gas phase and rapidly establish
   gas-particle equilibrium and (ii) have a short particle-phase lifetime
   (similar to 2-4 h). Such dynamic behavior has significant implications
   for the production and phase partitioning of pONs, organic aerosol mass,
   and reactive nitrogen speciation in a forested environment.}},

Title = {{Characterizing exons and introns by regularity of nucleotide strings}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY DIRECT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Translation of nucleotides into a numeric form has been
   approached in many ways and has allowed researchers to investigate the
   properties of protein-coding sequences and noncoding sequences.
   Typically, more pronounced long-range correlations and increased
   regularity were found in intron-containing genes and in non-transcribed
   regulatory DNA sequences, compared to cDNA sequences or intron-less
   genes. The regularity is assessed by spectral tools defined on numerical
   translates. In most popular approaches of numerical translation the
   resulting spectra depend on the assignment of numerical values to
   nucleotides. Our contribution is to propose and illustrate a spectra
   which remains invariant to the translation rules used in traditional
   approaches.
   Results: We outline a methodology for representing sequences of DNA
   nucleotides as numeric matrices in order to analytically investigate
   important structural characteristics of DNA. This representation allows
   us to compute the 2-dimensional wavelet transformation and assess
   regularity characteristics of the sequence via the slope of the wavelet
   spectra. In addition to computing a global slope measure for a sequence,
   we can apply our methodology for overlapping sections of nucleotides to
   obtain an ``evolutionary slope.{''} To illustrate our methodology, we
   analyzed 376 gene sequences from the first chromosome of the honeybee.
   Conclusion: For the genes analyzed, we find that introns are
   significantly more regular (lead to more negative spectral slopes) than
   exons, which agrees with the results from the literature where
   regularity is measured on ``DNA walks{''}. However, unlike DNA walks
   where the nucleotides are assigned numerical values depending on
   nucleotide characteristics (purine-pyrimidine, weak-strong hydrogen
   bonds, keto-amino, etc.) or other spatial assignments, the proposed
   spectral tool is invariant to the assignment of nucleotides. Thus,
   ambiguity in numerical translation of nucleotides is eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{Custom devices supporting bone regeneration and implant placement are
   needed for edentulous patients with large mandibular deficiencies where
   endosteal implantation is not possible. We developed a novel
   subperiosteal titanium-aluminum-vanadium bone onlay device produced by
   additive manufacturing (AM) and post-fabrication osteogenic
   micro-/nano-scale surface texture modification. Human osteoblasts
   produced osteogenic and angiogenic factors when grown on laser-sintered
   nano-/micro-textured surfaces compared to smooth surfaces.
   Surface-processed constructs caused higher bone-to-implant contact,
   vertical bone growth into disk pores (microCT and histomorphometry), and
   mechanical pull-out force at 5 and 10 w on rat calvaria compared to non
   surface-modified constructs, even when pre-treating the bone to
   stimulate osteogenesis. Surface-modified wrap-implants placed around
   rabbit tibias osseointegrated by 6 w. Finally, patient-specific
   constructs designed to support dental implants produced via AM and
   surface-processing were implanted on edentulous mandibular bone. 3 and 8
   month post-operative images showed new bone formation and
   osseointegration of the device and indicated stability of the dental
   implants.}},

Title = {{Design of a polymer thermoelectric generator using radial architecture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are solid-state heat engines consisting
   of p-type and n-type semiconductors that convert heat into electricity
   via the Seebeck effect. Conducting polymers are a viable alternative
   with intrinsic advantages over their inorganic counterparts, since they
   are abundant, flexible as thick-films, and have reduced manufacturing
   costs due to solution processing. Furthermore, polymers have an
   inherently low thermal conductivity, thus affording them the option of
   forgoing some heat exchanger costs. Current examples of polymer TE
   devices have been limited to traditional flat-plate geometries with
   power densities on the mu W/cm(2) scale, where their potential is not
   fully realized. Herein, we report a novel radial device architecture and
   model the improved performance of polymer-based TEG based on this
   architecture. Our radial architecture accommodates a fluid as the heat
   source and can operate under natural convection alone due to heat
   spreading. Analytical heat transfer and electrical models are presented
   that optimize the device for maximum power density, and for the first
   time we obtain the geometry matching condition that maximizes the
   efficiency. We predict high power densities of similar to 1 mW/cm(2)
   using state-of-the-art polymer TEs subjected to a temperature difference
   of 100 K, which is nearly 1000x higher than polymer flat-plate
   architectures reported in literature. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Tunability of collagen matrix mechanical properties via multiple modes
   of mineralization}},
Journal = {{INTERFACE FOCUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Functionally graded, mineralized collagen tissues exist at soft-to-hard
   material attachments throughout the body. However, the details of how
   collagen and hydroxyapatite mineral (HA) interact are not fully
   understood, hampering efforts to develop tissue-engineered constructs
   that can assist with repair of injuries at the attachments of soft
   tissues to bone. In this study, spatial control of mineralization was
   achieved in collagen matrices using simulated body fluids (SBFs). Based
   upon previous observations of poor bonding between reconstituted
   collagen and HA deposited using SBF, we hypothesized that mineralizing
   collagen in the presence of fetuin (which inhibits surface
   mineralization) would lead to more mineral deposition within the
   scaffold and therefore a greater increase in stiffness and toughness
   compared with collagen mineralized without fetuin. We tested this
   hypothesis through integrated synthesis, mechanical testing and
   modelling of graded, mineralized reconstituted collagen constructs.
   Results supported the hypothesis, and further suggested that
   mineralization on the interior of reconstituted collagen constructs, as
   promoted by fetuin, led to superior bonding between HA and collagen. The
   results provide us guidance for the development of mineralized collagen
   scaffolds, with implications for bone and tendon-to-bone tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate whether rare regulatory variants in the vicinity of
   promoters are likely to impact gene expression, we conducted a novel
   burden test for enrichment of rare variants at the extremes of
   expression. After sequencing 2-kb promoter regions of 472 genes in 410
   healthy adults, we performed a quadratic regression of rare variant
   count on bins of peripheral blood transcript abundance from microarrays,
   summing over ranks of all genes. After adjusting for common eQTLs and
   the major axes of gene expression covariance, a highly significant
   excess of variants with minor allele frequency less than 0.05 at both
   high and low extremes across individuals was observed. Further
   enrichment was seen in sites annotated as potentially regulatory by
   RegulomeDB, but a deficit of effects was associated with known metabolic
   disease genes. The main result replicates in an independent sample of 75
   individuals with RNA-seq and whole-genome sequence information. Three of
   four predicted large-effect sites were validated by CRISPR/Cas9
   knockdown in K562 cells, but simulations indicate that effect sizes need
   not be unusually large to produce the observed burden. Unusually
   divergent low-frequency promoter haplotypes were observed at 31 loci, at
   least 9 of which appear to be derived from Neandertal admixture, but
   these were not associated with divergent gene expression in blood. The
   overall burden test results are consistent with rare and private
   regulatory variants driving high or low transcription at specific loci,
   potentially contributing to disease.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are an important class of porous
   crystalline metal organic framework (MOF) materials that have attracted
   widespread attention for applications ranging from gas adsorption and
   separation to catalysis. Although the bulk crystal structures of MOFs
   are typically well-characterized, comparatively little is known
   regarding MOF defect structures. Drawing on analogies with conventional
   silicon based zeolites, we utilize computational methods to examine the
   structure and stability of putative point-defect structures (including
   vacancies, substitutions, and ``dangling{''} linkers) within the
   prototypical ZIF-8 structure. Considering both postsynthetic (gas-phase)
   and synthetic (solution-phase) conditions, we find that several of the
   defect structures lie low in energy relative to the defect-free parent
   crystal, with barriers to defect formation that are large but
   surmountable under relevant temperatures. These results are consistent
   with prior experimental observations of ZIF stability and reactivity and
   suggest that defects may play an important role in influencing the
   long-term stability of MOFs under conditions that include exposure to
   water vapor and trace contaminants such as acid gases.}},

Title = {{Consolidated bioprocessing of Populus using Clostridium
   (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum: a case study on the impact of lignin
   composition and structure}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Higher ratios of syringyl-to-guaiacyl (S/G) lignin
   components of Populus were shown to improve sugar release by enzymatic
   hydrolysis using commercial blends. Cellulolytic microbes are often
   robust biomass hydrolyzers and may offer cost advantages; however, it is
   unknown whether their activity can also be significantly influenced by
   the ratio of different monolignol types in Populus biomass. Hydrolysis
   and fermentation of autoclaved, but otherwise not pretreated Populus
   trichocarpa by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 was compared using
   feedstocks that had similar carbohydrate and total lignin contents but
   differed in S/G ratios.
   Results: Populus with an S/G ratio of 2.1 was converted more rapidly and
   to a greater extent compared to similar biomass that had a ratio of 1.2.
   For either microbes or commercial enzymes, an approximate 50 \% relative
   difference in total solids solubilization was measured for both
   biomasses, which suggests that the differences and limitations in the
   microbial breakdown of lignocellulose may be largely from the enzymatic
   hydrolytic process. Surprisingly, the reduction in glucan content per
   gram solid in the residual microbially processed biomass was similar
   (17-18 \%) irrespective of S/G ratio, pointing to a similar mechanism of
   solubilization that proceeded at different rates. Fermentation
   metabolome testing did not reveal the release of known biomass-derived
   alcohol and aldehyde inhibitors that could explain observed differences
   in microbial hydrolytic activity. Biomass-derived p-hydroxybenzoic acid
   was up to ninefold higher in low S/G ratio biomass fermentations, but
   was not found to be inhibitory in subsequent test fermentations.
   Cellulose crystallinity and degree of polymerization did not vary
   between Populus lines and had minor changes after fermentation. However,
   lignin molecular weights and cellulose accessibility determined by
   Simons' staining were positively correlated to the S/G content.
   Conclusions: Higher S/G ratios in Populus biomass lead to longer and
   more linear lignin chains and greater access to surface cellulosic
   content by microbe-bound enzymatic complexes. Substrate access
   limitation is suggested as a primary bottleneck in solubilization of
   minimally processed Populus, which has important implications for
   microbial deconstruction of lignocellulose biomass. Our findings will
   allow others to examine different Populus lines and to test if similar
   observations are possible for other plant species.}},

Title = {{Suboptimal Muscle Synergy Activation Patterns Generalize their Motor
   Function across Postures}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{We used a musculoskeletal model to investigate the possible
   biomechanical and neural bases of using consistent muscle synergy
   patterns to produce functional motor outputs across different
   biomechanical conditions, which we define as generalizability.
   Experimental studies in cats demonstrate that the same muscle synergies
   are used during reactive postural responses at widely varying
   configurations, producing similarly-oriented endpoint force vectors with
   respect to the limb axis. However, whether generalizability across
   postures arises due to similar biomechanical properties or to neural
   selection of a particular muscle activation pattern has not been
   explicitly tested. Here, we used a detailed cat hindlimb model to
   explore the set of feasible muscle activation patterns that produce
   experimental synergy force vectors at a target posture, and tested their
   generalizability by applying them to different test postures. We used
   three methods to select candidate muscle activation patterns: (1)
   randomly-selected feasible muscle activation patterns, (2) optimal
   muscle activation patterns minimizing muscle effort at a given posture,
   and (3) generalizable muscle activation patterns that explicitly
   minimized deviations from experimentally-identified synergy force
   vectors across all postures. Generalizability was measured by the
   deviation between the simulated force direction of the candidate muscle
   activation pattern and the experimental synergy force vectors at the
   test postures. Force angle deviations were the greatest for the randomly
   selected feasible muscle activation patterns (e.g., > 100 degrees),
   intermediate for effort-wise optimal muscle activation patterns (e.g.,
   similar to 20 degrees), and smallest for generalizable muscle activation
   patterns (e.g., <51 degrees). Generalizable muscle activation patterns
   were suboptimal in terms of effort, often exceeding 50\% of the maximum
   possible effort (cf. similar to 5\% in minimum-effort muscle activation
   patterns). The feasible muscle activation ranges of individual muscles
   associated with producing a specific synergy force vector was reduced by
   45\% when generalizability requirements were imposed. Muscles recruited
   in the generalizable muscle activation patterns had less sensitive
   torque-producing characteristics to changes in postures. We conclude
   that generalization of function across postures does not arise from limb
   biomechanics or a single optimality criterion. Muscle synergies may
   reflect acquired motor solutions globally tuned for generalizability
   across biomechanical contexts, facilitating rapid motor adaptation.}},

   interest as absorbents due to their high absorption capacity, low
   density, biodegradability, and large surface area. Hydrophobic aerogels
   have been designed to give excellent oil absorption tendency from water.
   Herein, we present an in situ method for CNF surface modification and
   hydrophobic aerogel preparation. Neither solvent exchange nor fluorine
   chemical is used in aerogel preparations. The as prepared hydrophobic
   aerogels exhibit low density (23.2 mg/cm(-3)), high porosity (98.5\%),
   good flexibility, and solvent induced shape recovery property.
   Successful surface modification was confirmed through field emission
   scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and water contact
   angle measurements. The hydrophobic aerogels show high absorption
   capacities for various oils, depending on liquid density, up to 47X
   their original weight but with low water uptake (<0.5 g/g aerogel).}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated, theoretically and experimentally, the
   unique photoactive behavior of pristine and defected indium oxide
   surfaces providing fundamental insights into their excited state
   properties as well as an explanation for the experimentally observed
   enhanced activity of defected indium oxide surfaces for the gas-phase
   reverse water gas shift reaction, CO2 + H-2 + h nu -> CO + H2O in the
   light compared to the dark. To this end, a detailed excited-state study
   of pristine and defected forms of indium oxide (In2O3, In2O3,
   In2O3(OH)(y) and In2O3-x(OH)(y)) surfaces was performed using time
   dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, the results of
   which were supported experimentally by transient absorption spectroscopy
   and photoconductivity measurements. It was found, that the surface
   frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) created by a Lewis acidic coordinately
   unsaturated surface indium site proximal to an oxygen vacancy and a
   Lewis basic surface hydroxide site in In2O3-x(OH)(y) become more acidic
   and basic and hence more active in the ES compared to the GS. This
   provides a theoretical mechanism responsible for the enhanced activity
   and reduced activation energy of the photochemical reverse water gas
   shift reaction observed experimentally for In2O3-x(OH)(y) compared to
   the thermochemical reaction. This fundamental insight into the role of
   photoexcited surface FLPs for catalytic CO2 reduction could lead to
   improved photocatalysts for solar fuel production.}},

   Bursting}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{It has been posited that the regulation of burst/tonic firing in the
   thalamus could function as a mechanism for controlling not only how much
   but what kind of information is conveyed to downstream cortical targets.
   Yet how this gating mechanism is adaptively modulated on fast timescales
   by ongoing sensory inputs in rich sensory environments remains unknown.
   Using single-unit recordings in the rat vibrissa thalamus (VPm), we
   found that the degree of bottom-up adaptation modulated thalamic
   burst/tonic firing as well as the synchronization of bursting across the
   thalamic population along a continuum for which the extremes facilitate
   detection or discrimination of sensory inputs. Optogenetic control of
   baseline membrane potential in thalamus further suggests that this
   regulation may result from an interplay between adaptive changes in
   thalamic membrane potential and synaptic drive from inputs to thalamus,
   setting the stage for an intricate control strategy upon which cortical
   computation is built.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to investigate the capabilities of three
   dimensional (3D) RVE models in predicting the tensile modulus of carbon
   nanotube/polypropylene (CNT/PP) composites, which differ slightly in the
   dispersion, agglomeration, and orientation states of CNT within the PP
   matrix. The composites are made using melt mixing followed by either
   injection molding or melt spinning of fibers. The dispersion,
   agglomeration, and orientation of CNT within the PP are experimentally
   altered by using a surfactant and by forcing the molten material to flow
   through a narrow orifice (melt spinning) that promotes alignment of CNT
   along the flow/drawing direction. An elaborate image analysis technique
   is used to quantify the CNT characteristics in terms of probability
   distribution functions (PDF). The PDF are then introduced to the 3D RVE
   models that also account for the CNT-PP interfacial interactions. It is
   concluded that the 3D RVE models can accurately distinguish among the
   different cases (dispersion, distribution, geometry, and alignment of
   CNT) as the predicted tensile modulus is in good agreement with the
   experimentally determined one.}},

Abstract = {{Ports play a critical role in transportation infrastructure but are

   Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program. Presented are the
   concepts and methods developed for the seismic risk management of a
   portwide system of berths. The framework used to calculate port losses
   is discussed, particularly the use of spatially correlated ground motion
   intensity measures that estimate damage to pile-supported wharves and
   container cranes, the repair costs and downtimes subsequently determined
   via repair models for both types of structures, and the impact on cargo
   handling operations calculated via logistical models of the port system.
   Results, expressed in the form of loss exceedance curves, are
   calculated.}},

Abstract = {{Failures of unreinforced masonry infill walls commonly occur during
   seismic events. One method of preventing such failures is the use of
   externally applied mesh reinforced mortar (MRM). This paper presents a
   finite element (FE) modeling scheme combining smeared crack and
   interface elements to simulate the seismic response of RC frames with
   hollow clay tile (HCT) infill and RC frames with HCT infill and MRM. The
   models can capture cracking patterns, timing of damages, and
   force-displacement behavior of the frames. A study modeling the
   plastering mortar with overlay elements and a transformed section
   approach suggests the latter gives more realistic predictions for
   initial stiffness and drift at peak strength. Parametric studies on the
   influence of dowel area and the placement of dowels indicate that there
   are diminishing returns in increasing the dowel area and that the
   connections must be present on both the top and bottom of the infill
   walls to be effective.}},
