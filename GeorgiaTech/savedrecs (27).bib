Abstract = {{The synthesis of ultra-long high-quality ZnO nanowires with uniform size
   and orientation on heterogeneous substrates is highly desirable, not
   only for investigating the fundamental properties of ZnO nanowires, but
   also for fabricating integrated functional nanodevices. Here we present
   a novel and general technique for growing vertically aligned ultra-long
   ZnO nanowires on various substrates. More importantly, the metal
   catalyst is experimentally determined not at the tip ends of the
   nanowires but at the junction area between the nanowires and the
   underlying substrate. Based on detailed analysis and control group
   results, we then propose a three-stage growth mechanism, in which
   vapor-liquid-solid growth and vapor-solid growth compete with each other
   to become dominant.}},

Abstract = {{The early Drosophila embryo is patterned by graded distributions of
   maternal transcription factors. Recent studies revealed that pattern
   formation by these graded signals depends on uniformly expressed
   transcriptional activators, such as Zelda. Removal of Zelda influences
   both the timing and the spatial expression domains for most of the genes
   controlled by maternal gradients. We demonstrate that some of these
   patterning defects, which range from temporal delay to loss of
   expression, can be rationalized with the use of a mathematical model
   based on cooperative binding of graded and uniform factors. This model
   makes a number of predictions, which we confirm experimentally by
   analyzing the expression of short gastrulation (sog), a gene that is
   controlled by a combination of the Dorsal morphogen gradient and Zelda.
   The proposed model suggests a general mechanism for the formation of
   nested gene expression domains, which is a hallmark of tissue patterning
   by morphogen gradients. According to this mechanism, the differential
   effects of a morphogen on its target genes can depend on their
   differential sensitivity to uniform factors.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of trace amounts of oil in water facilitates the

   sensors. MIR transparent silver halide fibers were utilized as optical
   transducer for interrogating oil-in-water emulsions via the evanescent
   field emanating from the waveguide surface, and penetrating the
   surrounding aqueous environment by a couple of micrometers. Unmodified
   fibers and fibers surface-modified with grafted epoxidized polybutadiene
   layers enabled the direct detection of crude oil in a deionized water
   matrix at the ppm level to ppb concentration level, respectively. Thus,
   direct chemical sensing of crude oil IR signatures without any sample
   preparation as low as 46 ppb was achieved with a response time of a few
   seconds.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing the radiocarbon (C-14) content of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in atmospheric particulate matter can provide
   estimates on the source contributions from biomass burning versus fossil
   fuel. The relative importance of these two sources to ambient PAHs
   varies considerably across regions and even countries, and hence there
   is a pressing need to apportion these sources. In this study, we
   advanced the radiocarbon analysis from bulk carbon to compound class
   specific radiocarbon analysis (CCSRA) to determine Delta C-14 and delta
   C-13 values of PAHs in PM2.5 samples for investigating biomass burning
   and fossil fuel source contributions to PAHs from one of the
   Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) sites in
   North Birmingham (BHM), Alabama during winter (December 2004-February
   2005) and summer (June-August 2005) by accelerator mass spectrometry. To
   compare our ambient samples to known sources, we collected and analyzed
   fenceline samples from the vicinity of a coke plant in BHM. As expected,
   PAHs from the coke plant fenceline samples had very low radiocarbon
   levels. Its Delta C-14 varied from -990 to -970 parts per thousand,
   indicating that 97 to 99\% were of fossil source. PAHs in the ambient
   PM2.5 had Delta C-14 from -968 to -911 parts per thousand, indicating
   that 92-97\% of PAHs were from fossil fuel combustion. These levels
   indicated the dominance of fossil sources of ambient PAHs. The
   radiocarbon level of ambient PAHs was higher in winter than in summer.
   Winter samples exhibited depleted delta C-13 value and enriched Delta
   C-14 value because of the increased contribution of PAHs from biomass
   burning source. However, biomass burning contributed more to heavier
   PAHs (modern source accounting for 6-8\%) than fighter ones with a
   modern contribution of 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that the melt processibility of
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is poor. In this article, a
   high-molecular-weight PTFE was extruded smoothly with a modified die;
   and critical shear rate could be raised to 4 s(-1), using a die with L/D
   (length to diameter) ratio of 200. Meanwhile, we compared the current
   PTFE fiber spinning method with melt spinning to investigate the effects
   of high-temperature treatment on the drawability of PTFE and found that
   the processing sequence could play a key role. The deformation imposed
   before or after the high-temperature treatment could determine whether
   the fibrillation can be achieved continuously and effectively. Based on
   the experiment phenomenon, together with the results of differential
   scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron
   microscopy characterization, we proposed a model to describe the
   submicron structural change of PTFE during extension. From this model,
   the fundamental mechanism for the poor melt processibility of PTFE was

Title = {{Modeling of the vapor release from the LCROSS impact: 2. Observations
   from LAMP}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Using a Monte Carlo model, we analyze the evolution of the vapor plume
   emanating from the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite
   (LCROSS) impact into Cabeus as seen by the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project
   (LAMP), a far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging spectrograph onboard the Lunar
   Reconnaissance Orbiter. The best fit to the data utilizes a bulk
   velocity between 3.0 and 4.0 km/s. The fits to the light curve comprised
   of Hg, Ca, and Mg are not strongly dependent on the temperature. In
   contrast, the best fit to the light curve from H-2 and CO corresponds to
   a 500 K thermal velocity distribution. The LAMP field of view primarily
   encounters particles released at low angles to the horizontal and misses
   fast moving particles released at more vertical angles. The isotropic
   model suggests that 117 +/- 16 kg H-2, 41 +/- 3 kg CO, 16 +/- 1 kg Ca,
   12.4 +/- 0.8 kg Hg, and 3.8 +/- 0.3 kg Mg are released by the LCROSS
   impact. Additional errors could arise from an anisotropic plume, which
   cannot be distinguished with LAMP data. Mg and Ca are likely
   incompletely volatilized owing to their high vapor temperatures. The
   highly volatile components (H-2 and CO) might derive from a greater mass
   of material. To agree with predicted abundances by weight of 0.047\%,
   0.023\%, 11\%, 0.28\% and 3.4\% for H-2, CO, Ca, Hg, and Mg,
   respectively, the species would be released from 250,000 kg, 180,000 kg,
   140 kg, 4400 kg, and 110 kg of regolith, respectively. This is
   consistent with the relative volatility of these species.}},

Title = {{Transcriptome profiling of a curdlan-producing Agrobacterium reveals
   conserved regulatory mechanisms of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ability to synthesize exopolysaccharides (EPS) is
   widespread among microorganisms, and microbial EPS play important roles
   in biofilm formation, pathogen persistence, and applications in the food
   and medical industries. Although it is well established that EPS
   synthesis is invariably in response to environmental cues, it remains
   largely unknown how various environmental signals trigger activation of
   the biochemical synthesis machinery.
   Results: We report here the transcriptome profiling of Agrobacterium sp.
   ATCC 31749, a microorganism that produces large amounts of a glucose
   polymer known as curdlan under nitrogen starvation. Transcriptome
   analysis revealed a nearly 100-fold upregulation of the curdlan
   synthesis operon upon transition to nitrogen starvation, thus
   establishing the prominent role that transcriptional regulation plays in
   the EPS synthesis. In addition to known mechanisms of EPS regulation
   such as activation by c di GMP, we identify novel mechanisms of
   regulation in ATCC 31749, including RpoN-independent NtrC regulation and
   intracellular pH regulation by acidocalcisomes. Furthermore, we show
   evidence that curdlan synthesis is also regulated by conserved cell
   stress responses, including polyphosphate accumulation and the stringent
   response. In fact, the stringent response signal, pppGpp, appears to be
   indispensible for transcriptional activation of curdlan biosynthesis.
   Conclusions: This study identifies several mechanisms regulating the
   synthesis of curdlan, an EPS with numerous applications. These
   mechanisms are potential metabolic engineering targets for improving the
   industrial production of curdlan from Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749.
   Furthermore, many of the genes identified in this study are highly
   conserved across microbial genomes, and we propose that the molecular
   elements identified in this study may serve as universal regulators of
   microbial EPS synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The standard simulation of a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) by a
   deterministic one essentially searches a large bounded-degree graph
   whose size is exponential in the running time of the NTM. The graph is
   the natural one defined by the configurations of the NTM. All methods in
   the literature have required time linear in the size S of this graph.
   This paper presents a new simulation method that runs in time (O) over

   on nondeterministic choices of states and tape head movements. Published

   characterization}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{The analysis and experimental characterization of the propagation
   constants and attenuation coefficients of surface plasmon (SP) modes in
   planar multimode metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides are presented.
   The experimental characterization is based on determining the width of
   the reflection angular spectrum in the attenuated total reflection (ATR)
   configuration. Due to its transverse character, the ATR configuration
   provides a more straightforward and simpler way to determine the
   propagation constants and attenuation coefficients of plasmonic modes in
   MIM structures, compared to using tapered end-couplers with multiple
   waveguide samples or near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). In
   this paper, the propagation constants and attenuation coefficients of
   multimode MIM structures are investigated, and MIM waveguide structures
   with 730 and 1460 nm SiO2 cores and Au claddings are fabricated and
   experimentally characterized. The measurement results indicate that the
   absorption of Au is responsible for the high attenuation in MIM
   plasmonic modes, while scattering loss is another source of attenuation
   for higher-order modes (smaller zigzag angles). To the best of the
   authors' knowledge, the present work represents the first time the
   attenuation coefficient and propagation constant of each mode in a
   multimode MIM waveguide have been individually measured.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of wound measurement techniques are available to clinicians.
   Options range from relatively simple and inexpensive to complex,
   expensive devices.
   An iterative design approach was used to evaluate and improve
   performance and clinical utility of a new wound measurement device
   (WMD). The design was based upon a commercially available Smartphone.
   Accuracy was assessed using bench testing and reliability of area
   measurements was determined using multiple evaluators. Clinical utility
   was investigated by deploying the WMD during wound rounds in a
   rehabilitation hospital.
   Accuracy testing revealed an average error <2\% at 0 degrees or skew and
   an average error of 4.28\% at 10 degrees of skew. The intra-rater
   reliability exceeded 0.975 for all raters and inter-rater reliability
   was 0.966. Clinical utility testing provided the opportunity to address
   several usability concerns including the software interface and
   computation times.
   The accuracy and reliability of a new, non-contact wound measurement
   device exceeded that of other manual techniques and were, at least,
   equivocal to other computer-based technologies. Some limitations of
   using a Smartphone were identified by the clinicians that can be
   addressed by the more advanced processing power of newer technology.
   Overall, the WMD was shown to have the potential as a useful clinical
   tool. (c) 2011 Tissue Viability Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the morphology change of Ag
   nano-particles/island film with the sputtering time and annealing
   temperature, Ag nano-particles/island films were sputtered on the
   silicon wafers by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. Ag
   nano-particles/islands films were sputtered on Si wafer with different
   time. After sputtering, the samples with Ag nano-particles/islands films
   were annealed at 100, 200 and 400 degrees C for I h, respectively. Raman
   spectrum was employed to examine the phase stability of Ag
   particles/island film after annealed at 400 degrees C for 1h. The result
   showed that the Raman spectrum peak of Ag particles/island film with
   annealed at 400 degrees C was similar to that of pure Ag. Scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) was used to test the microstructures and
   morphology of the films with different condition. To further study the
   morphology change, atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to test
   surface morphology of the Ag particles/islands films. The SEM and AFM
   results showed that the morphology of Ag nano-particles/island films
   were different with the increasing sputtering time. Ag particles went
   through a dramatic change on the Si wafer surface, when sputtering time
   changed from 3 to 60 s, Ag particles diffused and agglomerated with the
   annealing temperature increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristic boundary conditions that are capable of handling general

   based on fundamental thermodynamics theories incorporated into an

   incoming characteristic waves at boundaries accurately. The approach has
   been validated against a variety of sample problems at a broad range of
   fluid states and flow speeds. Both acoustic waves and hydrodynamic flow
   features can pass through the boundaries of computational domain
   transparently without any unphysical reflection or spurious distortion.
   The approach can be reliably applied to fluid flows at extensive
   thermodynamic states and flow speeds in numerical simulations. Moreover,
   the use of the boundary condition shows to improve the computational

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new vector-sum type variable-phase shifter (VPS)
   topology for predistorting the phase of a modulated signal for an
   analog-predistortion power amplifier system. It has a continuous
   linear-in-degree control curve over a 90 degrees phase-control range and
   has the smallest size among all those proposed CMOS works. The phase
   shifter utilizes an improved RC polyphase filter to generate in-phase
   and quadrature-phase vectors. It uses fewer RC components but has a
   wider phase-splitting bandwidth than traditional RC filters, reducing
   the loss and size of the overall VPS. Specially-designed control
   circuits give the shifter a linear phase-control capability, minimizing
   the gain variation over the phase-control range. The phase shifter,
   optimized for WCDMA applications, has been fabricated in a standard
   0.18-mu m CMOS process. The area of the phase shifter core is 0.063
   mm(2). The measured operation frequency is from 1 to 2.1 GHz, which is
   an overlap of its 3-dB cutoff frequency and bandwidth of a 90 degrees
   phase-control range. Within the bandwidth, this phase shifter displays a
   linear control curve with phase errors of less than +/-1 degrees over a
   70 degrees tuning range, making it suitable for accurate AM-PM error
   compensation.}},

Abstract = {{The naturally occurring structure of articular cartilage has proven to
   be an effective means for the facilitation of motion and load support in
   equine and other animal joints. For this reason, cartilage has been
   extensively studied for many years. Although the roughness of cartilage
   has been determined from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other methods
   in multiple studies, a comparison of roughness to joint function has not
   be completed. It is hypothesized that various joint types with different
   motions and regimes of lubrication have altered demands on the articular
   surface that may affect cartilage surface properties. Micro- and
   nanoscale stylus profilometry was performed on the carpal cartilage
   harvested from 16 equine forelimbs. Eighty cartilage surface samples
   taken from three different functioning joint types (radiocarpal,
   midcarpal, and carpometacarpal) were measured by a Veeco Dektak 150
   Stylus Surface Profilometer. The average surface roughness measurements
   were statistically different for each joint. This indicates that the
   structure of cartilage is adapted to, or worn by, its operating
   environment. Knowledge of cartilage micro- and nanoscale roughness will
   assist the future development and design of treatments for intra-
   articular substances or surfaces to preserve joint integrity and reduce
   limitations or loss of joint performance. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005934]}},

   Environmental scanning electron microscope images of expanded covered

Abstract = {{Gaussian process models, which include the class of linear models, are
   widely employed for modeling responses as a function of control or noise
   factors. Using these models, the average loss at control factor settings
   can be estimated and compared. However, robust design optimization is
   often performed based on the expected quadratic loss computed as if the
   posterior mean were the true response function. This can give very
   misleading results. We propose an expected quadratic loss criterion
   derived by taking expectation with respect to the noise factors and the
   posterior predictive process. Approximate but highly accurate credible
   intervals for the average quadratic loss are constructed via the
   numerical inversion of the Lugannani Rice saddlepoint approximation. The
   accuracy of the Lugannani Rice intervals is compared with intervals
   constructed via moment-matching techniques on real data. This article
   has supplementary materials that are available online.}},

Abstract = {{The choice between centralized and decentralized electricity generation
   is examined for 150 countries as a function of population distribution,
   electricity consumption, transmission cost, and the cost difference
   between decentralized and centralized electricity generation. A network
   algorithm is developed to find the shortest centralized transmission
   network that spans a given fraction of the population in a country. The
   least-cost combination of centralized and decentralized electricity that
   serves the country is determined. Case studies of Botswana, Uganda, and
   Bangladesh illustrate situations that are more and less suited for
   decentralized electrification. Specific maps for centralized and
   decentralized generation are presented to show how the least-cost option
   varies with the relative costs of centralized and decentralized
   generation and transmission cost. Centralized and decentralized
   fractions are calculated for 150 countries. For most of the world's
   population, centralized electricity is the least-cost option. For a
   number of countries, particularly in Africa, substantial populations and
   regions may be most cost-effectively served by decentralized
   electricity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High-affinity anchoring groups such as isothiocyanate (ITC, -N=C=S) are
   often used to attach organic chromophores (reporter molecules) to
   colloidal gold nanocrystals for surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS), to atomically smooth gold surfaces for tip-enhanced Raman
   scattering, and to scanning tunneling microscopy probes (nanosized
   electrodes) for single-molecule conductance measurements. However, it is
   still unclear how the attached molecules interact electronically with
   the underlying surface, and how the anchoring group might affect the
   electronic and optical properties of such nanoscale systems. Here we
   report systematic surface-enhanced Raman studies of two organic
   chromophores, malachite green (MG) and its ITC derivative (MGITC), that
   have very different functional groups for surface binding but nearly
   identical spectroscopic properties. A surprise finding is that, under
   the same experimental conditions, the SERS signal intensities for MGITC
   are nearly 500-fold higher than those of MG. Correcting for the
   intrinsic difference in scattering cross sections of these two dyes, we
   estimate that the MGITC enhancement factors are similar to 200-fold
   higher than for MG. Furthermore, pH-dependent studies reveal that the
   surface structure of MGITC is irreversibly stabilized or ``locked{''} in
   its pi-conjugated form and is no longer responsive to pH changes. In
   contrast, the electronic structure of adsorbed MG is still sensitive to
   pH and can be switched between its localized and delocalized electronic
   forms. These results indicate that ITC is indeed an unusual anchoring
   group that enables strong electronic coupling between gold and the
   adsorbed dye, leading to more efficient chemical enhancement and higher
   overall enhancement factors.}},

Abstract = {{The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a powerful and widely used
   instrument to image topography and measure forces at the micrometer and
   nanometer length scale. Because of the high degree of operating accuracy
   required of the instrument, small thermal and mechanical drifts of the
   cantilever and piezoactuator systems hamper measurements as the AFM tip
   drifts spatially relative to the sample surface. To compensate for the
   drift, we control the tip-surface distance by monitoring the cantilever
   quality factor (Q) in a closed loop. Brownian thermal fluctuations
   provide sufficient actuation to accurately determine cantilever Q by
   fitting the thermal noise spectrum to a Lorentzian function. We show
   that the cantilever damping is sufficiently affected by the tip-surface
   distance so that the tip position of soft cantilevers can be maintained
   within 40 nm of a setpoint in air and within 3 nm in water with 95\%
   reliability. Utilizing this method to hover the tip above a sample
   surface, we have the capability to study sensitive interactions at the
   nanometer length scale over long periods of time. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{The fabrication, detailed characterization, and molecular transport
   properties of nanocomposite membranes containing high fractions (up to

   microstructure, SWNT dispersion, SWNT dimensions, and intertubular
   distances within the composite membranes are characterized by scanning
   and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), energy-dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), XRD rocking curve analysis,
   small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and solid-state NMR PVA/SWNT
   nanocomposite membranes prepared from SWNT gels allow uniform dispersion
   of individual SWNTs in the PVA matrix with a random distribution of
   orientations. SAXS analysis reveals the length (similar to-500 nm) and
   outer diameter (similar to 1.2 nm) of the dispersed SWNTs. Electron
   microscopy indicates good adhesion. between. the SWNTs and the PVA
   matrix without the occurrence of defects such as voids and pinholes. The
   transport properties of the PVA/SWNT membranes are investigated
   experimentally by ethanol/water mixture pervaporation measurements,
   computationally by grand canonical Monte. Carlo and molecular dynamics,
   and by a macroscopic transport model for anisotropic permeation through
   nanotube-polymer composite membranes. The nanocomposite membranes
   substantially enhance the water throughput with increasing SWNT volume
   fraction, which leads to a moderate reduction of the water/ethanol
   selectivity. The model is parameterized purely from molecular simulation
   data with no fitted parameters, and shows reasonably good agreement with
   the experimental water permeability data.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-change-based global sea-level rise is of concern because it
   contributes to significant loss of coastal wetlands and mangroves and to
   increasing damage from coastal flooding in many regions of the world.
   Physical mechanisms that describe the dynamic global climate systems and
   the effect of this system behavior on sea-level rise are inherently
   complex. In this study, conducted using systematic analysis of historic
   data on temperature change and sea-level rise, a linear dynamic system
   model is proposed to predict global sea-level rise and mean surface
   temperatures. Unlike the semiempirical approaches proposed in the recent
   literature, this model incorporates the inherent interaction between
   temperature and sea-level rise into the model. The resulting model,
   recognized from the historic data, shows that the rate of sea-level rise
   is proportional to temperature, and this rise is also a function of the
   temporal state of the sea level. Similarly, the rate of temperature
   change is a function of the temporal state of the temperature and is
   also affected by the sea-level rise. The proposed model is also used to
   predict the sea-level rise during the 21st century.

   port that faces the possibility of a large earthquake and note-despite
   some recent progress in developing emergency response plans-the
   relatively low level of both port preparation for potential earthquakes
   and stakeholder participation in risk mitigation planning. It is
   concluded that increased attention to the quality of stakeholder input
   is likely to improve port seismic risk-management decision processes. In
   a final section, several recommendations for ways to enhance the
   involvement of key port stakeholders and, in turn, the likely
   effectiveness of seismic risk-management choices are provided. DOI:

Abstract = {{We study the dynamic assignment of flexible servers to stations in the
   presence of setup costs that are incurred when servers move between
   stations. The goal is to maximize the long-run average profit. We
   provide a general problem formulation and some structural results, and
   then concentrate on tandem lines with two stations, two servers, and a
   finite buffer between the stations. We investigate how the optimal
   server assignment policy for such systems depends on the magnitude of
   the setup costs, as well as on the homogeneity of servers and tasks.
   More specifically, for systems with either homogeneous servers or
   homogeneous tasks, small buffer sizes, and constant setup cost, we prove
   the optimality of ``multiple threshold{''} policies (where servers'
   movement between stations depends on both the number of jobs in the
   system and the locations of the servers) and determine the values of the
   thresholds. For systems with heterogeneous servers and tasks, small
   buffers, and constant setup cost, we provide results that partially
   characterize the optimal server assignment policy. Finally, for systems
   with larger buffer sizes and various service rate and setup cost
   configurations, we present structural results for the optimal policy and
   provide numerical results that strongly support the optimality of
   multiple threshold policies.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant elastin-like protein (ELP) polymers display several
   favorable characteristics for tissue repair and replacement as well as
   drug delivery applications. However, these materials are derived from
   peptide sequences that do not lend themselves to cell adhesion,
   migration, or proliferation. This report describes the chemoselective
   ligation of peptide linkers bearing the bioactive RGD sequence to the
   surface of ELP hydrogels. Initially, cystamine is conjugated to ELP,
   followed by the temperature-driven formation of elastomeric ELP
   hydrogels. Cystamine reduction produces reactive thiols that are coupled
   to the RGD peptide linker via a terminal maleimide group. Investigations
   into the behavior of endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells on the
   RGD-modified ELP hydrogel surface reveal significantly enhanced
   attachment, spreading, migration and proliferation. Attached endothelial
   cells display a quiescent phenotype. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Ideal outcomes in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine involve biomaterials that can enhance cell differentiation and
   production of local factors for natural tissue regeneration without the
   use of systemic drugs. Biomaterials typically used in tissue engineering
   applications include polymeric scaffolds that mimic the
   three-dimensional structural environment of the native tissue, but these
   are often functionalized with proteins or small peptides to improve
   their biological performance. For bone applications, titanium implants,
   or more appropriately the TiO2 passive oxide layer formed on their
   surface, have been shown to enhance osteoblast differentiation in vitro
   and to promote osseointegration in vivo. In this study we evaluated the
   effect on osteoblast differentiation of pure TiO2 nanofiber meshes with
   different surface microroughness and nanofiber diameters, prepared by
   the electrospinning method. MG63 cells were seeded on TiO2 meshes, and
   cell number, differentiation markers and local factor production were
   analyzed. The results showed that cells grew throughout the entire
   surfaces and with similar morphology in all groups. Cell number was
   sensitive to surface microroughness, whereas cell differentiation and
   local factor production was regulated by both surface roughness and
   nanofiber diameter. These results indicate that scaffold structural cues
   alone can be used to drive cell differentiation and create an osteogenic
   environment without the use of exogenous factors. (C) 2011 Acta

Abstract = {{This paper presents a concurrent atomistic continuum (CAC) methodology
   for three-dimensional dynamic simulation of dislocation nucleation,
   migration and interaction. The method is based on a new continuum field
   formulation of balance laws with relevant atomistic information (the
   arrangements and interactions of atoms) considered. In this work, we
   show that the new CAC method allows the smooth passage of dislocations
   through sharp interfaces between the atomistic and the coarse-grained
   finite element domains without unphysical reflection of dislocations or
   the need for heuristic rules; meanwhile, complex dislocation phenomena
   such as dislocation nucleation, dynamic strain bursts associated with
   nucleation and migration avalanches, formations of Lomer-Cottrell locks,
   dislocation rigid boundary interactions, formation of intrinsic and
   extrinsic stacking faults, deformation twinning, and curved dislocation
   loops can be reproduced by the CAC method. All of the CAC simulations
   are directly compared with the corresponding atomic-level molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations. The efficiency, accuracy and potential
   applications of the method are discussed along with necessary additional
   development of criteria for coarse graining. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Spontaneous Zr/Ti gradient formation during crystallization in
   sol-gel-processed Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O-3 films is used to prepare
   superlattice-like (SL), highly (100)-oriented thin films on
   Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates. SLs with stacking periodicity ranging from 13
   up to 60 nm are synthesized with compositional gradient normal to the
   film surface and composition centered at x approximate to 0.53. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) shows high order satellite peaks and no secondary
   phases. XRD structural refinement, along with XPS depth profile chemical
   analysis, reveals that the crystal structure alternates between
   rhombohedral and in-plane polarized tetragonal phases, effectively
   corresponding to ``artificially created{''} phase boundaries. SL films
   have similar to 45\% and similar to 20\% higher d(33,f) piezoelectric
   coefficient and dielectric permittivity, respectively, with respect to
   compositional-gradient-free films of similar thickness, possibly due to
   enhanced reorientation of electrical dipoles and higher extrinsic
   contributions due to the motion of the ``artificially created{''} phase
   boundaries in SL films. Dielectric nonlinear studies indicate a higher
   amount of extrinsic contributions to the dielectric response in SL and
   gradient-enhanced films than in conventional films of similar average
   composition. This processing method provides a simple chemical route to
   create thin ferroelectric films with enhanced dielectric and
   piezoelectric properties suitable for a range of miniaturized
   applications. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{189-195}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{A nano-catalyst Fe on TiO2 was prepared and tested for efficient total
   organic carbon (TOC) removal during the photocatalytic oxidation of
   chlorophenols. The preparation included a sol-gel process and
   calcinations followed by chemical reductive deposition of Fe. The
   Fe/TiO2 composite catalysts were more effective in dechlorination,
   oxidation of 2,4-DCP (2,4-dicholorophenol) and TOC removal, under UV
   irradiation, than pure Fe or pure TiO2. The catalysts were characterized
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The loaded forms of iron include Fe,
   Fe2+ and FeOOH due to the reaction with oxygen. The Fe/TiO2 catalyst has
   significantly increased optical absorption than TiO2. The optimal pH

Abstract = {{Closed-loop feedback control and command shaping are often used together
   to achieve superior control performance. In many cases, the feedback
   control is designed and implemented first. Then, the command shaping is
   designed to improve the resulting closed-loop dynamics. However, there
   is an often-overlooked advantage of optimally combining these two
   control schemes. This study will show that proportional and derivative
   feedback control can be intelligently used to create a closed-loop
   system that is particularly advantageous when input shaping is used as a
   filter outside of the loop. Experimental results are shown to verify the

   enumeration of the Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA gene in groundwater}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{88}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) commonly uses the fluorogenic 5'
   nuclease (TaqMan) and SYBR Green 1 (SG) detection chemistries to
   enumerate biomarker genes. Dehalococcoides (Dhc) are keystone bacteria
   for the detoxification of chlorinated ethenes, and the Dhc 16S ribosomal
   RNA (rRNA) gene serves as a biomarker for monitoring reductive
   dechlorination in contaminated aquifers. qPCR enumeration of Dhc
   biomarker genes using the TaqMan or SG approach with the same primer set
   yielded linear calibration curves over a seven orders of magnitude range
   with similar amplification efficiencies. The TaqMan assay discriminates
   specific from nonspecific amplification observed at low template
   concentrations with the SG assay, and had a 10-fold lower limit of
   detection of similar to 3 copies per assay. When applied to Dhc pure
   cultures and Dhc-containing consortia, both detection methods enumerated
   Dhc biomarker genes with differences not exceeding 3-fold. Greater
   variability was observed with groundwater samples, and the SG chemistry
   produced false-positive results or yielded up to 6-fold higher biomarker
   gene abundances compared to the TaqMan method. In most cases, the
   apparent error associated with SG detection resulted from quantification
   of nonspecific amplification products and was more pronounced with
   groundwater samples that had low biomarker concentrations or contained
   PCR inhibitors. Correction of the apparent error using
   post-amplification melting curve analysis produced 2 to 21-fold lower
   abundance estimates; however, gel electrophoretic analysis of amplicons
   demonstrated that melting curve analysis was insufficient to recognize
   all nonspecific amplification. Upon exclusion of nonspecific
   amplification products identified by combined melting curve and
   electrophoretic amplicon analyses, the SG method produced false-negative
   results compared to the TaqMan method. To achieve sensitive and accurate
   quantification of Dhc biomarker genes in environmental samples (e.g.,
   groundwater) and avoid erroneous conclusions, the analysis should rely
   on TaqMan detection chemistry, unless additional analyses validate the
   results obtained with the SG approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In recent years, interest in personal noise exposure has expanded beyond
   a workplace safety measure to become an effective means of investigating
   physiological effects of the acoustic environment on an individual. This
   work investigates the effects of the wearer's voice as a possible
   dominant sound source on body-mounted noise dosimeters and develops
   methods to improve the application of dosimeter measurements in
   medium-level noise environments. Subjects experienced a controlled set
   of acoustic conditions while wearing a dosimeter. In each condition,
   sound pressure levels were recorded with and without the subject
   speaking controlled phrases. Three experimental variables were
   considered-room type, noise type, and noise level. All three variables
   had a statistically significant effect upon the contribution of speech
   to a dosimeter measurement; for example, noise level was shown to cause
   a change in speech contribution by as much as 5.5 dB between sequential
   levels. Based upon the analysis, a method of predicting the decibel
   contribution of a wearer's voice was developed. The results of this
   study can be used to estimate the effect of a wearer's voice on
   dosimeter measurements in medium-level noise environments. (C) 2012

   tomography (CT) scanning. Instrumented structures included the melon,
   nares, ear, thoracic wall, lungs, epaxial muscle, and lower abdomen. The
   specimen was suspended from a frame equipped with a standard
   50.8-mm-diameter spherical transducer used as the acoustic source and
   additional receiving sensors to monitor the transmitted and external,
   scattered field. Following immersion, the transducer transmitted pulsed
   sinusoidal signals at 5, 7, and 10 kHz. Quantitative internal pressure
   fields are reported for all cases except those in which the gauge failed
   or no received signal was detected. A full necropsy was performed

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1522-1531}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Lithiation of individual silicon nanopartides was studied in real time
   with in situ transmission electron microscopy. A strong size dependence
   of fracture was discovered; that Is, there exists a critical particle
   diameter of similar to 150 nm, below which the particles neither cracked
   nor fractured upon first lithiation, and above which the particles
   initially formed surface cracks and then fractured due to
   lithiation-induced swelling. The unexpected surface cracking arose owing
   to the buildup of large tensile hoop stress, which reversed the initial
   compression, in the surface layer. The stress reversal was attributed to
   the unique mechanism of lithiation in crystalline Si, taking place by
   movement of a two-phase boundary between the inner core of pristine Si
   and the outer shell of amorphous Li-Si alloy. While the resulting hoop
   tension tended to initiate surface cracks, the small-sized nanoparticles
   nevertheless averted fracture. This is because the stored strain energy
   from electrochemical reactions was insufficient to drive crack
   propagation, as dictated by the interplay between the two length scales,
   that is, particle diameter and crack size, that control the fracture.
   These results are diametrically opposite to those obtained previously
   from single-phase modeling, which predicted only compressive hoop stress
   In the surface layer and thus crack initiation from the center in
   lithiated Si particles and wires. Our work provides direct evidence of
   the mechanical robustness of small Si nanoparticles for applications in
   lithium ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) fabricated
   at a maximum processing temperature of 250 degrees C operate with high
   field-effect mobility compared with amorphous-silicon TFTs. By reducing
   the oxygen content in the channel layer, ambipolar behavior can be
   obtained. Two levels of electron-beam lithography are employed to
   fabricate nc-Si TFTs with nanoscale dimensions that operate without
   significant short-channel effects for gate lengths down to 200 nm. The
   TFTs have current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with on-off ratio >
   10(5) at +/- 1 V drain voltage and low threshold voltage shift.
   Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) software is
   used to model the TFTs, and it is validated by performing the fit to
   devices of different dimensions. An inverter constituent of nc-Si TFTs
   offers high voltage gain (10-12) and frequency response better than 2
   MHz. The crowbar current associated with the inverter can be minimized
   by using an optimized geometry ratio based on the leakage currents of
   the TFTs. An amplifier circuit is also demonstrated, offering an ac gain
   in the frequency range of 100 Hz-10 kHz. SPICE simulations of the
   inverter and amplifier show close agreement with measured data. The
   fabricated devices are well suited for use in high-density
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present and discuss selected results of our recent
   studies of sorbate self-diffusion in microporous materials. The main
   focus is given to transport properties of carbon molecular sieve (CMS)
   membranes as well as of the intergrowth of FAU-type and EMT-type
   zeolites. CMS membranes show promise for applications in separations of
   mixtures of small gas molecules, while FAU/EMT intergrowth can be used
   as an active and selective cracking catalyst. For both types of
   applications diffusion of guest molecules in the micropore networks of
   these materials is expected to play an important role. Diffusion studies
   were performed by a pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR technique that
   combines advantages of high field (17.6 T) NMR and high magnetic field
   gradients (up to 30 T/m). This technique has been recently introduced at
   the University of Florida in collaboration with the National Magnet Lab.
   In addition to a more conventional proton PFG NMR, also carbon-13 PFG
   NMR was used.}},

Title = {{Multiscale 3D shape representation and segmentation with applications to
   hippocampal/caudate extraction from brain MRI}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{374-385}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Extracting structure of interest from medical images is an important yet
   tedious work. Due to the image quality, the shape knowledge is widely
   used for assisting and constraining the segmentation process. In many
   previous works, shape knowledge was incorporated by first constructing a
   shape space from training cases, and then constraining the segmentation
   process to be within the learned shape space. However, such an approach
   has certain limitations due to the number of variations,
   eigen-shapemodes, that can be captured in the learned shape space.
   Moreover, small scale shape variances are usually overwhelmed by those
   in the large scale, and therefore the local shape information is lost.
   In this work, we present a multiscale representation for shapes with
   arbitrary topology, and a fully automatic method to segment the target
   organ/tissue from medical images using such multiscale shape information
   and local image features. First, we handle the problem of lacking
   eigen-shapemodes by providing a multiscale shape representation using
   the wavelet transform. Consequently, the shape variances existing in the
   training shapes captured by the statistical learning step are also
   represented at various scales. Note that by doing so, one can greatly
   enrich the eigen-shapemodes as well as capture small scale shape
   changes. Furthermore, in order to make full use of the training
   information, not only the shape but also the gray-scale training images
   are utilized in a multi-atlas initialization procedure. By combining
   such initialization with the multiscale shape knowledge, we perform
   segmentation tests for challenging medical data sets where the target
   objects have low contrast and sharp corner structures, and demonstrate
   the statistically significant improvement obtained by employing such
   multiscale representation, in representing shapes as well as the overall
   shape based segmentation tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{It is known that bulk ZnO is a nonmagnetic material. However, the
   electronic band structure of ZnO is severely distorted when the ZnO is
   in the shape of a very thin plate with its dimension along the c-axis
   reduced to a few nanometers while keeping the bulk scale sizes in the
   other two dimensions. We found that the chemically synthesized ZnO
   nanoplates exhibit magnetism even at room temperature. First-principles
   calculations show a growing asymmetry in the spin distribution within
   the distorted bands formed from Zn (3d) and O (2p) orbitals with the
   reduction of thickness of the ZnO nanoplates, which is suggested to be
   responsible for the observed magnetism. In contrast, reducing the
   dimension along the a- or b-axes of a ZnO crystal does not yield any
   magnetism for ZnO nanowires that grow along c-axis, suggesting that the
   internal electric field produced by the large \{0001\} polar surfaces of
   the nanoplates may be responsible for the distorted electronic band
   structures of thin ZnO nanoplates.}},

Abstract = {{Using data from direct numerical simulations in the Reynolds number
   range 8 <= R-lambda <= 1000, where R-lambda is the Taylor microscale
   Reynolds number, we assess the Reynolds number scaling of the microscale
   and the integral length scale of pressure fluctuations in homogeneous
   and isotropic turbulence. The root-mean-square (rms) pressure (in
   kinematic units) is about 0.91 rho u'(2), where u' is the rms velocity
   in any one direction. The ratio of the pressure microscale to the
   (longitudinal) velocity Taylor microscale is a constant of about 0.74
   for very low Reynolds numbers but increases approximately as
   0.17R(lambda)(1/3) at high Reynolds numbers. We discuss these results in
   the context of the existing theory and provide plausible explanations,
   based on intermittency, for their observed trends. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Progress on industrial-scale propagation of conifers by somatic
   embryogenesis has been hampered by the differences in developmental
   capabilities between cell lines, which are limiting the capture of
   genetic gains from breeding programs. In this study, we investigated the
   metabolic events occurring during somatic embryo development in Norway
   spruce to establish a better understanding of the fundamental metabolic
   events required for somatic embryo development. Three embryogenic cell
   lines of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) with different
   developmental capabilities were studied during somatic embryo
   development from proliferation of proembryogenic masses to mature
   somatic embryos. The three different cell lines displayed normal,
   aberrant and blocked somatic embryo development. Metabolite profiles
   from four development stages in each of the cell lines were obtained
   using combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate
   discriminant analyses of the metabolic data revealed significant
   metabolites (P < 0.05) for each development stage and transition. The
   results suggest that endogenous auxin and sugar signaling affects
   initial stages of somatic embryo development. Furthermore, the results
   highlight the importance of a timed stress response and the presence of
   stimulatory metabolites during late stages of embryo development.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajplung.00260.2011.-To define roles for reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in maintaining lung
   fluid balance in vivo, we used two novel whole animal imaging
   approaches. Live X-ray fluoroscopy enabled quantification of air space
   fluid content of C57BL/6J mouse lungs challenged by intratracheal (IT)
   instillation of saline; results were confirmed by using conventional
   lung wet-to-dry weight ratios and Evans blue as measures of pulmonary
   edema. Visualization and quantification of ROS produced in lungs was
   performed in mice that had been administered a redox-sensitive dye,
   hydro-Cy7, by IT instillation. We found that inhibition of NADPH oxidase
   with a Rac-1 inhibitor, NSC23766, resulted in alveolar flooding, which
   correlated with a decrease in lung ROS production in vivo. Consistent
   with a role for Nox2 in alveolar fluid balance, Nox2(-/-) mice showed
   increased retention of air space fluid compared with wild-type controls.
   Interestingly, fluoroscopic analysis of C57BL/6J lungs IT instilled with
   LPS showed an acute stimulation of lung fluid clearance and ROS
   production in vivo that was abrogated by the ROS scavenger
   tetramethylpiperidine- N-oxyl (TEMPO). Acute application of LPS
   increased the activity of 20 pS nonselective ENaC channels in rat type 1
   cells; the average number of channel and single-channel open probability
   (NPo) increased from 0.14 +/- 0.04 to 0.62 +/- 0.23. Application of
   TEMPO to the same cell-attached recording caused an immediate
   significant decrease in ENaC NPo to 0.04 +/- 0.03. These data
   demonstrate that, in vivo, ROS has the capacity to stimulate lung fluid
   clearance by increasing ENaC activity.}},

Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cells (PSC) provide insight into development and may
   underpin new cell therapies, yet controlling PSC differentiation to
   generate functional cells remains a significant challenge. In this study
   we explored the concept that mimicking the local in vivo
   microenvironment during mesoderm specification could promote the
   emergence of hematopoietic progenitor cells from embryonic stem cells
   (ESCs). First, we assessed the expression of early phenotypic markers of
   mesoderm differentiation (E-cadherin, brachyury (T-GFP). PDGFR alpha,
   and Flk1: +/-ETPF) to reveal that E-T+P+F+ cells have the highest
   capacity for hematopoiesis. Second, we determined how initial aggregate
   size influences the emergence of mesodermal phenotypes (E-T+P+F+,
   E-T-P+/-F+, and E-T-P+F-) and discovered that colony forming cell (CFC)
   output was maximal with similar to 100 cells per PSC aggregate. Finally,
   we introduced these 100-cell PSC aggregates into a low oxygen
   environment (5\%; to upregulate endogenous VEGF secretion) and delivered
   two potent blood-inductive molecules, BMP4 and TPO (bone morphogenetic
   protein-4 and thrombopoietin), locally from microparticles to obtain a
   more robust differentiation response than soluble delivery methods
   alone. Approximately 1.7-fold more CFCs were generated with localized
   delivery in comparison to exogenous delivery, while combined growth
   factor use was reduced 14.2-fold. By systematically engineering the
   complex and dynamic environmental signals associated with the in vivo
   blood developmental niche we demonstrate a significant role for
   inductive endogenous signaling and introduce a tunable platform for
   enhancing PSC differentiation efficiency to specific lineages. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{It is increasingly common to see computer-based simulation being used as
   a vehicle to model and analyze business processes in relation to process
   management and improvement. While there are a number of business process
   management (BPM) and business process simulation (BPS) methodologies,
   approaches and tools available, it is more desirable to have a systemic
   BPS approach for operational decision support, from constructing process
   models based on historical data to simulating processes for typical and
   common problems. In this paper, we have proposed a generic approach of
   BPS for operational decision support which includes business processes
   modeling and workflow simulation with the models generated. Processes
   are modeled with event graphs through process mining from workflow logs
   that have integrated comprehensive information about the control-flow,
   data and resource aspects of a business process. A case study of a
   credit card application is presented to illustrate the steps involved in
   constructing an event graph. The evaluation detail is also given in
   terms of precision, generalization and robustness. Based on the event
   graph model constructed. we simulate the process under different
   scenarios and analyze the simulation logs for three generic problems in
   the case study: 1) suitable resource allocation plan for different case
   arrival rates; 2) teamwork performance under different case arrival
   rates; and 3) evaluation and prediction for personal performances. Our
   experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to model
   business processes using event graphs and simulate the processes for
   common operational decision support which collectively play an important
   role in process management and improvement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We report significantly enhanced propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8)
   selectivity in mixed matrix membranes fabricated using 6FDA-DAM
   polyimide and a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). Equilibrium
   isotherms and sorption kinetics of C3H6 and C-3 Hs at 35 degrees C were
   studied on a 200 nm commercially available ZIF-8 sample produced by
   BASF. Mixed matrix dense films were formed with 6FDA-DAM and 200 nm BASF
   ZIF-8 particles. SEM imaging showed generally good adhesion between the
   ZIF-8 and 6FDA-DAM without the need for surface-treating ZIF-8. Pure gas
   permeation showed significantly enhanced mixed matrix ZIF-8/6FDA-DAM
   membrane C3H6/C3H8 separation performance over the pure 6FDA-DAM
   membrane performance. A C3H5 permeability of 56.2 Barrer and C3H6/C3H8
   ideal selectivity of 31.0 was found in ZIF-8/6FDA-DAM mixed matrix
   membrane with 48.0 wt\% ZIF-8 loading, which are 258\% and 150\% higher
   than the pure 6FDA-DAM membrane, respectively for permeability and
   selectivity. Permeation properties of C3H6 and C3H8 in ZIF-8 were
   back-calculated by the Maxwell model for composite permeability using
   pure gas permeation data, leading to a C3H6 permeability of 277 Barrer
   and C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 122. Mixed gas permeation also verified
   that selectivity enhancements were achievable in mixed gas environment

Title = {{Mechanisms of antibiotic removal by nanofiltration membranes: Model
   development and application}},

Abstract = {{Nanofiltration (NF) membranes have been shown to effectively remove
   low-molecular-weight compounds, but predicting their rejection has posed
   challenges due to the fact that multiple mechanisms can be involved
   (e.g. adsorption, steric-hindrance effects, and electrostatic effects)
   that concurrently control removal. The objective of this study was to
   systematically evaluate which factors were responsible for steady-state
   rejection of selected antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and
   carbadox (CDX) for three NF membranes of varying tightness through a
   unique modeling approach which accounts for the fact that these
   compounds bear distinctive acid-base speciation properties under varying
   pH conditions. Both the steric-hindrance/pore-diffusion model for
   neutral solutes along with the Donnan steric partitioning model for
   charged solutes were integrated together to predict overall rejection.
   This is the first known study to evaluate compound rejection of
   compounds that carry such unique speciation properties as a function of
   pH by using such a combined approach. Antibiotic rejection was found to
   vary with both pH and membrane tightness. Rejection controlled by charge
   repulsion effects was accurately predicted for both negatively charged
   solutes such as SMX- and CDX- and positively charged solutes such as
   SMX+. However, rejection controlled by steric-hindrance effects for
   neutral solutes either overestimated (e.g. SMX) or underestimated (e.g.
   CDX) rejection by up to 23\%. These findings improve the understanding
   of which transport mechanisms influence rejection of both neutral and
   charged low-molecular-weight compounds by NF membranes so that removal
   can be better predicted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Out-of-plane displacement (warpage) has been a major reliability concern
   for board-level electronic packaging. Printed wiring board (PWB) and
   component warpage results principally from coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) mismatch among the materials that make up the PWB
   assembly (PWBA). Warpage occurring during surface-mount assembly
   processes and normal operations may lead to severe solder bump failures.
   In this paper, the classical laminated plate theory was applied to study
   the warpage behavior of PWBs and PWBAs during the thermal reflow
   process. The rule of mixtures was used to estimate the effective
   material properties of PWBA composites. Closed form solutions of the
   differential equations for the PWB and PWBA deformation were generated
   from the classical lamination theory to evaluate the sample warpage. The
   board support conditions and thermal gradients through the assembly
   thickness were considered in the theoretical model. The calculated
   warpage results were compared with experimental results using the
   projection moire measurement system in a simulated convective reflow
   process to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Finite element modeling
   was applied to estimate the sample warpage values under the same thermal
   loading and boundary constraints. The warpage values obtained from the
   theoretical models show high sensitivity to the thermal loads,
   through-the-thickness temperature gradients of the test samples, and CTE
   values of the composite materials. The relative warpage results obtained
   from the theoretical models and numerical models agreed well with the
   experimental measurement results during the thermal reflow process.}},

   Materials \& Methods: The Gd-NPs were developed through coordination of

   sequential atom transfer radical polymerizations, and evaluated by
   measuring their T-1 relaxivity in vitro and imaging their T-1 contrast
   in tissue using MRI. Results: Solution and MRI studies demonstrated that
   these Gd-NPs exhibit remarkably high T-1 relaxivity on both per particle

Abstract = {{Optogenetics is an excellent tool for noninvasive activation and
   silencing of neurons and muscles. Although they have been widely
   adopted, illumination techniques for optogenetic tools remain limited
   and relatively nonstandardized. We present a protocol for constructing
   an illumination system capable of dynamic multispectral optical
   targeting of micrometer-sized structures in both stationary and moving
   objects. The initial steps of the protocol describe how to modify an
   off-the-shelf video projector by insertion of optical filters and
   modification of projector optics. Subsequent steps involve altering the
   microscope's epifluorescence optical train as well as alignment and
   characterization of the system. When fully assembled, the illumination
   system is capable of dynamically projecting multispectral patterns with
   a resolution better than 10 mu m at medium magnifications. Compared with
   other custom-assembled systems and commercially available products, this
   protocol allows a researcher to assemble the illumination system for a
   fraction of the cost and can be completed within a few days.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a method was developed to generalize the multigroup theory to
   estimate the fine-group angular flux within a coarse-group transport
   calculation. In the development of that method, the angular dependence
   of the coarse-group total cross section was neglected. As is well known,
   this approximation introduces errors in the transport solution making
   its accuracy dependent on the number of coarse groups and the choice of
   group structure. This paper extends the generalized energy condensation
   theory to explicitly account for the angular dependence of the
   coarse-group total cross section. This is accomplished in a natural way
   by modifying the treatment of the total cross section to include
   orthogonal expansions in both energy and angle. As a result, the
   fine-group flux can be consistently reproduced during the coarse-group
   calculation. This method paves the way for recondensation of the cross
   sections on-the-fly thereby eliminating the errors introduced by using
   simplified problems (e.g. lattice-cells) to estimate the coarse-group
   cross sections. In this paper, the method is derived in general geometry
   and implemented and verified with several 1D reactor problems (both LWR
   and VHTR). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-We recently reported that lowering of macrophage free
   intracellular iron increases expression of cholesterol efflux
   transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 by reducing generation of reactive oxygen
   species. In this study, we explored whether reducing macrophage
   intracellular iron levels via pharmacological suppression of hepcidin
   can increase macrophage-specific expression of cholesterol efflux
   transporters and reduce atherosclerosis.
   Methods and Results-To suppress hepcidin, increase expression of the
   iron exporter ferroportin, and reduce macrophage intracellular iron, we
   used a small molecule inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
   signaling, LDN 193189 (LDN). LDN (10 mg/kg IP b.i.d.) was administered
   to mice, and its effects on atherosclerosis, intracellular iron,
   oxidative stress, lipid efflux, and foam cell formation were measured in
   plaques and peritoneal macrophages. Long-term LDN administration to
   apolipoprotein E-/- mice increased ABCA1 immunoreactivity within
   intraplaque macrophages by 3.7-fold (n = 8; P = 0.03), reduced Oil Red
   O-positive lipid area by 50\% (n = 8; P = 0.02), and decreased total
   plaque area by 43\% (n = 8; P = 0.001). LDN suppressed liver hepcidin
   transcription and increased macrophage ferroportin, lowering
   intracellular iron and hydrogen peroxide production. LDN treatment
   increased macrophage ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression, significantly raised
   cholesterol efflux to ApoA-1, and decreased foam cell formation. All
   preceding LDN-induced effects on cholesterol efflux were reversed by
   exogenous hepcidin administration, suggesting modulation of
   intracellular iron levels within macrophages as the mechanism by which
   LDN triggers these effects.
   Conclusion-These data suggest that pharmacological manipulation of iron
   homeostasis may be a promising target to increase macrophage reverse
   cholesterol transport and limit atherosclerosis. (Arterioscler Thromb
   Vasc Biol. 2012;32:299-307.)}},

Abstract = {{Objective-Chronic inflammation drives progressive and pathological
   remodeling inherent to formation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
   Syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that
   displays the capacity to modulate inflammatory processes within the
   vascular wall. In the current investigation, the role of Sdc-1 in AAA
   formation was examined using 2 models of experimental aneurysm
   induction, angiotensin II infusion and elastase perfusion.
   Methods and Results-Sdc-1 deficiency exacerbated AAA formation in both
   experimental models and was associated with increased degradation of
   elastin, greater protease activity, and enhanced inflammatory cell
   recruitment into the aortic wall. Bone marrow transplantation studies
   indicated that deficiency of Sdc-1 in marrow-derived cells significantly
   contributed to AAA severity. Immunostaining revealed augmented Sdc-1
   expression in a subset of AAA localized macrophages. We specifically
   characterized a higher percentage of CD4(+) T cells in Sdc-1-deficient
   AAA, and antibody depletion studies established the active role of T
   cells in aneurysmal dilatation. Finally, we confirmed the ability of
   Sdc-1 macrophage to modulate the inflammatory chemokine environment.
   Conclusion-These investigations identify cross-talk between
   Sdc-1-expressing macrophages and AAA-localized CD4(+) T cells, with
   Sdc-1 providing an important counterbalance to T-cell-driven
   inflammation in the vascular wall. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012;

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in orchestrating the host
   responses to a wide variety of foreign antigens and are essential in
   maintaining immune tolerance. Distinct biomaterials have been shown to
   differentially affect the phenotype of DCs, which suggested that
   biomaterials may be used to modulate immune response toward the biologic
   component in combination products. The elucidation of biomaterial
   property-DC phenotype relationships is expected to inform rational
   design of immuno-modulatory biomaterials. In this study, DC response to
   a set of 12 polymethacrylates (pMAs) was assessed in terms of surface
   marker expression and cytokine profile. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) determined that surface carbon correlated with enhanced DC
   maturation, while surface oxygen was associated with an immature DC
   phenotype. Partial square linear regression, a multivariate modeling
   approach, was implemented and successfully predicted biomaterial-induced
   DC phenotype in terms of surface marker expression from biomaterial
   properties with R-prediction(2) = 0.76. Furthermore, prediction of DC
   phenotype was effective based on only theoretical chemical composition
   of the bulk polymers with R-prediction(2) = 0.80. These results
   demonstrated that immune cell response can be predicted from biomaterial
   properties, and computational models will expedite future biomaterial
   design and selection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper designs a comprehensive approach based on the engineering
   machine/system concept, to model, analyze, and assess the level of
   carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial

   the correlation between levels of CO2 fluxes and a variety of
   influencing factors in eco-environments. The engineering/machine concept
   used is a system protocol that includes the sequential activities of
   design, test, observe, and model. This concept is applied to explicitly
   include various influencing factors and interactions associated with CO2
   fluxes. To formulate effective models of a large and complex climate
   system, this article introduces a modeling technique that will be
   referred to as stochastic filtering analysis of variance (SF-ANOVA). The
   CO2 flux data observed from some sites of AmeriFlux are used to
   illustrate and validate the analysis, prediction, and globalization
   capabilities of the proposed engineering approach and the SF-ANOVA
   technique. The SF-ANOVA modeling approach was compared to stepwise
   regression, ridge regression, and neural networks. The comparison
   indicated that the proposed approach is a valid and effective tool with
   similar accuracy and less complexity than the other procedures.}},

   suggests that these fees will be more broadly adopted by low cost

   can impact other system performance objectives such as minimizing the
   number of misconnecting passengers. We estimate that the debundling

Abstract = {{Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a major modifier of disease severity in sickle
   cell anemia (SCA). Threemajor HbF quantitative trait loci (QTL) are
   known: the Xmn I site upstream of G g-globin gene (HBG2) on chromosome
   11p15, BCL11A on chromosome 2p16, and HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism
   (HMIP) on chromosome 6q23. However, the roles of these QTLs in patients
   with SCA with uncharacteristically high HbF are not known. We studied 20
   African American patients with SCA with markedly elevated HbF (mean
   17.2\%). They had significantly higher minor allele frequencies (MAF) in
   two HbF QTLs, BCL11A, and HMIP, compared with those with low HbF. A 3-bp
   (TAC) deletion in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the minor
   allele of rs9399137 in HMIP was also present significantly more often in
   these patients. To further explore other genetic loci that might be
   responsible for this high HbF, we sequenced a 14.1 kb DNA fragment
   between the (A)gamma-(HBG1) and delta-globin genes (HBD). Thirty-eight
   SNPs were found. Four SNPs had significantly higher major allele
   frequencies in the unusually high HbF group. In silico analyses of these
   four polymorphisms predicted alteration in transcription factor binding

Abstract = {{A concept describing the nanostructure-directed dynamics of acid/base
   interaction and the balance between physisorption and chemisorption on
   an extrinsic semiconductor interface is evaluated and compared for n-
   and p-type semiconductors. The inverse hard/soft acid/base (IHSAB)
   concept, as it complements the HSAB concept, defines the nature of a
   dominant physisorption behavior and enables the creation of a matrix of
   controllable interactions. The technology results in the coupling of
   Lewis acid/base chemistry with the extrinsic semiconductor majority
   carriers. Nanoporous silicon layers facilitate the application of
   nanostructured metal/metal oxides, which provide sensitivity and
   selectivity for the modified interface. Applied fractional depositions
   can produce a dominant reversible physisorptive (sensors) or
   chemisorptive (microreactors) interaction at the semiconductor interface
   as the nanostructures act as antennas to focus the interaction. The
   dynamic natures of n- and p-type silicon are evaluated and compared, by
   focusing on the controlled manipulation of these semiconductors as they
   are modified with nanostructures and interact with the gas-phase
   analytes. The observed semiconductor responses correlate well with the
   temperature dependence of the extrinsic semiconductor, the population of
   the donor or acceptor levels, and the inherent mobilities of electrons.
   The response of the modified n-type semiconductors is found to exceed
   that of comparable p-type systems. The IHSAB concept can be extended to
   assess the properties of several additional semiconductor interfaces
   including nanowires. The results obtained not only pertain to sensor and
   microreactor array design, but also suggest the importance of the
   dynamic changes created, as the majority charge-carrier concentrations
   are manipulated and the Fermi energies are modified through chemical
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Relearning of motor skills is important in neurorehabilitation. We
   investigated the improvement of training success during simple tongue
   protrusion (two force levels) and a more complex tongue-training
   paradigm using the Tongue Drive System (TDS). We also compared
   subject-based reports of fun, pain, fatigue, and motivation between
   paradigms. Three randomized sessions and one control experiment were
   performed. Sixteen healthy subjects completed two different 1-h sessions
   of simple tongue training with 1 N and 3 N, respectively, and one TDS
   session. After 1 wk, six out of 16 subjects participated as experienced
   subjects with six naive subjects in a control experiment with 2 x 5-min
   TDS training separated by a 30-min rest. Performance improved during
   training in all sessions. The mean +/- SEM relative increase in success
   was 80 +/- 12\% (1 N), 52 +/- 11\% (3 N), and 285 +/- 45\% (TDS). In the
   control experiment the experienced group performed equal to the last 5
   min of their first TDS session and neither group improved during rest.
   Training with the TDS was rated as more fun, less painful, less
   fatiguing, and more motivating compared with simple tongue training. In
   conclusion, force level and complexity of tongue training influences
   behavioral aspects of tongue motor learning.}},

Abstract = {{The former Homestake mine in South Dakota (USA) cuts fractured
   metamorphic rock over a region several km(2) in plan, and plunges to the
   SE to a depth of 2.4 km. Numerical simulations of the development and
   dewatering of the mine workings are based on idealizing the
   mine-workings system as two overlapping continua, one representing the
   open drifts and the other representing the host rock with hydrologic
   properties that vary with effective stress. Equating macroscopic
   hydrologic properties with characteristics of deformable fractures
   allows the number of parameters to be reduced, and it provides a
   physically based justification for changes in properties with depth. The
   simulations explain important observations, including the co-existence
   of shallow and deep flow systems, the total dewatering flow rate, the
   spatial distribution of in-flow, and the magnitude of porosity in the
   mine workings. The analysis indicates that a deep flow system induced by
   similar to 125 years of mining is contained within a surface-truncated
   ellipsoid roughly 8 km by 4 km in plan view and 5.5 km deep with its
   long-axis aligned to the strike of the workings. Groundwater flow into
   the southern side of the workings is characterized by short travel times
   from the ground surface, whereas flow into the northern side and at
   depth consists of old water removed from storage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a solution for the problem of uncorrelated user
   selection in mobile cognitive radio ad hoc networks, with the objective
   to increase the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing. For this, a
   fully distributed user selection algorithm is developed by adaptively
   selecting uncorrelated cognitive radio users, which is able to account
   for dynamic changes in the network topology and in the channel
   conditions. Since the proposed user selection is based on the evaluation
   of the correlation experienced by the cognitive radio users, it is
   mandatory to have a parameter able to measure the correlation among
   them. For this, a spatial correlation coefficient is proposed to express
   the correlation characteristics of mobile cognitive radio users in
   different environments. Performance evaluation is conducted through
   simulations, and the results reveal the benefits of adopting the
   proposed correlation-aware user selection for cooperative spectrum
   sensing.}},

   newborn ventricles. We studied newborn (2 to 4 days old) and adult (> 8
   weeks old) rabbit hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (30 min of
   ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion). Our data demonstrated chamber- and
   age-specific changes in oxidative stress. During ischemia, hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) increased in both right-ventricular (RV) and
   left-ventricular (LV) myocytes of the newborn, although only the RV
   change was significant. In contrast, there was no significant increase
   in H2O2 in either RV or LV myocytes of adults. There was a fivefold
   increase in H2O2 formation in newborn RV myocytes compared with adults
   (P = 0.006). In whole-heart tissue, superoxide dismutase activity
   increased from sham versus ischemia in the left ventricle of both adult
   and newborn hearts, but it was increased only in the right ventricle of
   the newborn heart. Catalase activity was significantly increased after
   ischemia in both adult ventricles, whereas no increase was seen in
   newborn compared with sham hearts. In addition, catalase levels in
   newborns were significantly lower, indicating less scavenging potential.
   Nanoparticle-encapsulated ebselen, given as an intracardiac injection
   into the right or left ventricle of newborn hearts, significantly
   increased functional recovery of developed pressure only in the right
   ventricle, indicating the potential for localized antioxidant therapy
   during and after pediatric surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, measuring the local tensile strength in inhomogeneous
   materials is not standardised, nor accepted techniques are available
   despite such technique would be beneficial in a variety of technological
   applications. Thus, this work introduces an innovative method for
   assessing stressstrain properties at a sub-millimeter scale and
   illustrates the potential of the technique by evaluating the strength of
   a sub-region in the HAZ from welded steels pipes. The method employs a
   fully instrumented stage inside a scanning electron microscope that
   stretches small tensile specimens (2.0 mm x 0.5 mm cross-section, 12.5
   mm gage length) while registering detailed images of the deformed
   region. The specimens, cut from full-scale welds, include in their gage
   length weld metal, base metal and HAZ and have an 85 mu m period grid of
   evaporated lead on their surface to visualise the deformation. Upon
   straining, local strain is determined by correlating sequential images
   of the specimen surface with an open source code for particle image
   velocimetry. The calculated local strain within the HAZ and the load
   values recorded during testing are converted into a local stressstrain
   response. The results for two different heat inputs agree with usual,
   but indirect and less accurate assessments procedures, including local
   hardness measurements and notched bar testing.}},

Title = {{The impact of a lean rounding process in a pediatric intensive care unit}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{608-617}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction/Objective: Poor workflow associated with physician rounding
   can produce inefficiencies that decrease time for essential activities,
   delay clinical decisions, and reduce staff and patient satisfaction.
   Workflow and provider resources were not optimized when a pediatric
   intensive care unit increased by 22,000 square feet (to 33,000) and by
   nine beds (to 30). Lean methods (focusing on essential processes) and
   scenario analysis were used to develop and implement a patient-centric
   standardized rounding process, which we hypothesize would lead to
   improved rounding efficiency, decrease required physician resources,
   improve satisfaction, and enhance throughput.
   Design: Human factors techniques and statistical tools were used to
   collect and analyze observational data for 11 rounding events before and
   12 rounding events after process redesign. Actions included: 1)
   recording rounding events, times, and patient interactions and
   classifying them as essential, nonessential, or nonvalue added; 2)
   comparing rounding duration and time per patient to determine the impact
   on efficiency; 3) analyzing discharge orders for timeliness; 4)
   conducting staff surveys to assess improvements in communication and
   care coordination; and 5) analyzing customer satisfaction data to
   evaluate impact on patient experience.
   Setting: Thirty-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a children's
   hospital with academic affiliation.
   Patients/Subjects: Eight attending pediatric intensivists and their
   physician rounding teams.
   Interventions: Eight attending physician-led teams were observed for 11
   rounding events before and 12 rounding events after implementation of a
   standardized lean rounding process focusing on essential processes.
   Measurements and Main Results: Total rounding time decreased
   significantly (157 +/- 35 mins before vs. 121 +/- 20 mins after),
   through a reduction in time spent on nonessential (53 +/- 30 vs. 9 +/- 6
   mins) activities. The previous process required three attending
   physicians for an average of 157 mins (7.55 attending physician
   man-hours), while the new process required two attending physicians for
   an average of 121 mins (4.03 attending physician man-hours). Cumulative
   distribution of completed patient rounds by hour of day showed an
   improvement from 40\% to 80\% of patients rounded by 9: 30 AM. Discharge
   data showed pediatric intensive care unit patients were discharged an
   average of 58.05 mins sooner (p < .05). Staff surveys showed a
   significant increase in satisfaction with the new process (including
   increased efficiency, improved physician identification, and clearer
   understanding of process). Customer satisfaction scores showed
   improvement after implementing the new process.
   Conclusions: Implementation of a lean-focused, patient-centric rounding
   structure stressing essential processes was associated with increased
   timeliness and efficiency of rounds, improved staff and customer
   satisfaction, improved throughput, and reduced attending physician
   man-hours. (Crit Care Med 2012; 40:608-617)}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{129-135}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that minimally invasive
   microneedles cause less pain during injection of lidocaine, but induce
   local anesthesia in humans with the same rapid onset and efficacy as
   intradermal lidocaine injection using hypodermic needles.
   Methods: This study was a randomized, single-blinded, within
   participants, controlled design. Hollow, 500-mm long microneedles were
   used to inject lidocaine to the forearm of 15 human participants. The
   associated pain was recorded using a visual analog (VAS) scale. The area
   and depth of numbness were determined at 0, 7.5, and 15 minutes after
   injection. Lidocaine was also injected to the dorsum of the hand near a
   vein, followed by placement of an intravenous catheter and measurement
   of associated pain. A 26-gauge intradermal bevel hypodermic needle
   similarly administered lidocaine on the opposite forearm/hand to serve
   as the positive control.
   Results: VAS pain scores revealed that injection using microneedles was
   significantly less painful than hypodermic needles for both the forearm
   and dorsum of the hand injections. However, there was no significant
   difference in the area or depth of the resulting numbness between the 2
   treatment methods at any time point (0, 7.5, and 15 min) indicating that
   microneedles had immediate onset and were as effective as hypodermic
   needles in inducing dermal anesthesia. Moreover, insertion of an
   intravenous catheter immediately after lidocaine injection on the dorsum
   of the hand led to comparable pain scores for the microneedle and
   hypodermic needle treated sites, further confirming efficacy of
   microneedles in inducing rapid local anesthesia. Lastly, 77\% of the
   participants preferred microneedles and 80\% indicated that they did not
   consider microneedles to be painful.
   Discussion: This study demonstrates for the first time that
   microneedle-based lidocaine injection is as rapid and as effective as
   hypodermic injection in inducing local anesthesia while resulting in
   significantly less pain during injection.}},

Journal = {{CRYOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Long-term storage of natural tissues or tissue-engineered constructs is
   critical to allow off-the-shelf availability. Vitrification is a method
   of cryopreservation that eliminates ice formation, as ice may be
   detrimental to the function of natural or bioartificial tissues. In
   order to achieve the vitreous state, high concentrations of CPAs must be
   added and later removed. The high concentrations may be deleterious to
   cells as the CPAs are cytotoxic and single-step addition or removal will
   result in excessive osmotic excursions and cell death. A previously
   described mathematical model accounting for the mass transfer of CPAs
   through the sample matrix and cell membrane was expanded to incorporate
   heat transfer and CPA cytotoxicity. Simulations were performed for two
   systems, an encapsulated system of insulin-secreting cells and articular
   cartilage, each with different transport properties, geometry and size.
   Cytotoxicity and mass transfer are dependent on temperature, with a
   higher temperature allowing more rapid mass transfer but also causing
   increased cytotoxicity. The effects of temperature are exacerbated for
   art.cular cartilage, which has larger dimensions and slower mass
   transport through the matrix. Simulations indicate that addition and
   removal at 4 degrees C is preferable to 25 degrees C, as cell death is
   higher at 25 degrees C due to increased cytotoxicity in spite of the
   faster mass transport. Additionally, the model indicates that less
   cytotoxic CPAs, especially at high temperature, would significantly
   improve the cryopreservation outcome. Overall, the mathematical model
   allows the design of addition and removal protocols that insure CFA
   equilibration throughout the sample while still minimizing CPA exposure
   and maximizing cell survival. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-69}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The ability to detect confusion using facial electromyography
   (EMG) was evaluated.
   Background: Facial EMG has been useful in detecting various emotional
   states. Another state potentially detectable from facial musculature is
   confusion. Confusion reflects a loss of understanding or, in a dynamic
   environment, a loss of situation understanding or situation awareness.
   Method: For this study, 24 participants listened to a confusing and a
   neutral audio passage while they were monitored with EMG. Electrical
   activity of the right and left corrugator supercilii, the right
   zygomaticus major, and right depressor anguli oris was recorded.
   Participants also reported whether they felt confused during the
   experimental passage. Finally, they were asked to pose facial
   expressions. Two raters assessed responses in the graphed EMG data for
   evidence of activation near a confusing sentence in the passage.
   Results: EMG revealed confusion in 21 of 24 (87.5\%) participants, even
   in some participants who did not admit confusion. Posed expressions of
   confusion differed somewhat from spontaneous expressions elicited during
   the experimental passage.
   Conclusion: EMG was effective in detecting confusion, regardless of
   operator self-report. Not all muscles in the face were important for the
   detection of confusion: The zygomaticus major led to a large number of
   false positives.
   Application: EMG can be an effective addition to a sensor suite designed
   to monitor the cognitive state of operators of systems.}},

Title = {{Enhanced Vector Signal Transmission Over Double-Sideband
   Carrier-Suppressed Optical Millimeter-Waves Through a Small LO

Abstract = {{We proposed a new vector signal transmission scheme for double-sideband
   with carrier-suppressed (DSB-CS) radio-over-fiber system. The
   traditional single-stage DSB-CS scheme will induce signal phase
   distortion, and is therefore not suitable for vector signal delivery.
   However, by taking the advantage of the intrinsic local oscillator (LO)
   power feedthrough at a physical mixer, we found the phase information of
   the received vector signal would be preserved without introducing any
   hardware complexity to transmitter and receiver system setup. A
   feasibility demonstration of transmitting tri-band 16QAM-orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing signal carried by a DSB-CS optical
   mm-wave has been achieved with a received error vector machine value
   less than 14.8\% after 100-km standard single-mode fiber and over 5-m
   wireless distance. In addition, the optimal value and dynamic range for
   the LO input power was investigated and experimentally measured.}},

Volume = {{291}},

Abstract = {{The ASEDRA (Advanced Synthetically Enhanced Detector Resolution
   Algorithm, patent pending) has been successfully applied as a post
   processing algorithm to both sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) and cesium iodide
   (CsI(Na)) scintillator detectors to synthetically enhance their realized
   spectral data resolution by as much as a factor of three, wherein from
   these detectors the ``raw{''} unprocessed spectra are traditionally of
   poor resolution. ASEDRA uses noise reduction and built-in high
   resolution Monte Carlo radiation transport based detector response
   functions (DRFs) to rapidly post-process a spectrum in a few seconds on
   a standard laptop; gamma lines are extracted with an accuracy that makes
   the scintillator detectors competitive with higher resolution, higher
   material cost detectors. ASEDRA differs from other tools in the field,
   such as Sandia's GADRAS software, in that ASEDRA performs a differential
   spectrum attribution and cumulative extraction from the sample spectrum,
   rather than an integral-based approach, as in GADRAS. Previous
   publications have highlighted the successful application of ASEDRA in
   samples with plutonium and various isotopes. A new SmartID nuclide
   identification package to accompany ASEDRA has recently been implemented
   for test and evaluation purposes for sample attribution; in addition,
   the application of ASEDRA+SmartID has occurred with success in long
   dwell cargo monitoring and SNM detection applications, enabling new
   protocols for HEU detection. Overall, this paper presents recent
   developments and results along with a discussion of follow-on steps in
   the development of ASEDRA as an effective field gamma spectrum analysis
   tool for low cost scintillators.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study convex optimization methods for computing the
   nuclear (or, trace) norm regularized least squares estimate in
   multivariate linear regression. The so-called factor estimation and
   selection method, recently proposed by Yuan et al. (J Royal Stat Soc Ser
   B (Statistical Methodology) 69(3):329-346, 2007) conducts parameter
   estimation and factor selection simultaneously and have been shown to
   enjoy nice properties in both large and finite samples. To compute the
   estimates, however, can be very challenging in practice because of the
   high dimensionality and the nuclear norm constraint. In this paper, we
   explore a variant due to Tseng of Nesterov's smooth method and interior
   point methods for computing the penalized least squares estimate. The
   performance of these methods is then compared using a set of randomly
   generated instances. We show that the variant of Nesterov's smooth
   method generally outperforms the interior point method implemented in
   SDPT3 version 4.0 (beta) (Toh et al. On the implementation and usage of
   sdpt3-a matlab software package for semidefinite-quadratic-linear

Abstract = {{A tube is a solid bounded by the union of a one-parameter family of
   circles that may be decomposed into canal-surfaces and planar disks or
   annuli. A screw-sweep is the region swept by a shape during a screw
   motion. HelSweeper computes the boundary of a screw-sweep of an
   arbitrary union of tubes and polyhedra. To do so, it generates a
   superset of faces, splits them at their intersections, and selects the
   face portions that form the desired boundary. The novelty of the
   proposed approach lies in the fact that the faces contributed to this
   superset by a tube are each a screw-sweeps of a rigid curve (generator),
   which is the locus of grazing points, and that each grazing point is
   formulated as the intersection of a circle of the tube with a
   corresponding screw-plane. Hence, each such face is a one-parameter
   family of helices, each being the screw-sweep of a grazing point. (C)

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel approach for machine health condition
   prognosis based on neuro-fuzzy systems (NFSs) and Bayesian algorithms.
   The NFS, after training with machine condition data, is employed as a
   prognostic model to forecast the evolution of the machine fault state
   with time. An online model update scheme is developed on the basis of
   the probability density function (PDF) of the NFS residuals between the
   actual and predicted condition data. Bayesian estimation algorithms
   adopt the model's predicted data as prior information in combination
   with online measurements to update the degree of belief in the
   forecasting estimations. In order to simplify the implementation of the
   proposed approach, a recursive Bayesian algorithm called particle
   filtering is utilized to calculate in real time a posterior PDF by a set
   of random samples (or particles) with associated weights. When new data
   become available, the weights of all particles are updated, and then,
   predictions are carried out, which form the PDF of the predicted
   estimations. The developed method is evaluated via two experimental
   cases-a cracked carrier plate and a faulty bearing. The prediction
   performance is compared with three prevalent machine condition
   predictors-recurrent neural networks, NFSs, and recurrent NFSs. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict machine
   conditions more accurately.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{204-217}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides an asymptotic analysis of the transmission delay
   experienced by SUs for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks. It is
   shown that DSA induces only light-tailed delay if both the busy time of
   PU channels and the message size of SUs are light tailed. On the
   contrary, if either the busy time or the message size is heavy tailed,
   then the SUs' transmission delay is heavy tailed. For this latter case,
   it is proven that if one of either the busy time or the message size is
   light tailed and the other is regularly varying with index alpha, the
   transmission delay is regularly varying with the same index. As a
   consequence, the delay has an infinite mean provided alpha < 1 and an
   infinite variance provided alpha < 2. Furthermore, if both the busy time
   and the message size are regularly varying with different indices, then
   the delay tail distribution is as heavy as the one with the smaller
   index. Moreover, the impact of spectrum mobility and multiradio
   diversity on the delay performance of SUs is studied. It is shown that
   both spectrum mobility and multiradio diversity can greatly mitigate the
   heavy-tailed delay by increasing the orders of its finite moments.}},

   frequencies of interest during voluntary contraction. The vibrations
   that are naturally generated by skeletal muscles were recorded by a
   two-dimensional array of skin mounted accelerometers over the biceps
   brachii muscle (surface mechanomyogram, S-MMG) during voluntary
   isometric contractions in ten healthy young men. As a measure of the
   similarity of vibration between a given pair of accelerometers, the
   spatial coherence of S-MMG at low (f < 25 Hz) and high (f > 25 Hz)
   frequency bands were investigated to determine if the coupling of the
   natural mechanical vibrations were due to the different physiological
   muscle activity at low and high frequencies. In both frequency bands,
   spatial coherence values for sensor pairs aligned longitudinally along
   the proximal to distal ends of the biceps were significantly higher
   compared with those for the sensor pairs oriented perpendicular to the
   muscle fibers. This difference was more evident at the higher frequency
   band. The findings indicated that coherent mechanical oscillations
   mainly propagated along the longitudinal direction of the biceps brachii
   muscle fibers at high frequencies (f > 25 Hz). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large shear stresses may develop at interfaces between dissimilar
   materials during thermal excursions when there is a significant
   difference in their coefficients of thermal expansion. The shear stress
   may cause interfaces to slide via diffusional process, thereby
   accommodating the relative dimensional changes between the two
   materials. This phenomenon presents a significant reliability issue in
   three-dimensional (3-D) interconnect structures involving
   through-silicon vias (TSVs), which are subjected not only to continuous
   thermal cycling but also to large electric current densities during
   service. This paper reports experimental evidence of interfacial sliding
   between Cu and Si in Cu-filled TSVs during thermal cycling conditions,
   and in the presence of electric current. Two different thermal cycling
   conditions were used: (i) small Delta T thermal cycling (-25A degrees C
   to 135A degrees C) and (ii) large Delta T thermal cycling (25A degrees C
   to 425A degrees C). Prior to thermal cycling, a few Cu-filled TSV
   samples were annealed for 30 min at 425A degrees C. Cu intruded inside
   Si in nonannealed samples during small Delta T thermal cycling, whereas
   protrusion of Cu relative to Si occurred during all other thermal
   excursions. Application of electric current biased the net displacement
   of the Cu in the direction of electron flow, leading to enhanced
   protrusion (or intrusion) of Cu relative to the thermal cycling only
   (i.e., without electric current) condition. A simple one-dimensional
   analytical model and associated numerical simulations are utilized to
   rationalize the experimental observations.}},

Pages = {{637-645}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a direct comparison between two fundamental methods of
   chemically doping the 2-dimensional graphene sheet: (1) passivation of
   dangling a-bonds resulting from a vacancy defect and (2) charge transfer
   from adsorption on the pristine basal plane. Using electron beam
   lithography and the negative tone resist hydrogen silsesquioxane, we are
   able to observe the doping contribution from the passivation of such
   defects that naturally reside along the edge of graphene sheets, and
   directly compare them to the doping limitations of basal plane
   adsorption methods. We demonstrate that the passivation of the edge is
   over three orders of magnitude more efficient for chemical doping than
   adsorption, in terms of conducting carriers donated per available
   C-atom. Moreover, as large-area graphene sheets are tailored into
   nanoscale devices, and the portion of C-atoms that occupy the edge
   increases, we demonstrate that edge decoration becomes a more pronounced
   method of chemical doping, exhibiting a scaling law that will induce
   vast carrier densities and dominance over adsorption techniques in the
   nanoscale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Indium tin oxide (ITO) films were fabricated by (i) RF sputtering and
   (ii) spin coating of a colloidal ITO dispersion synthesized in-house.
   Films were deposited onto glass and quartz substrates and were annealed
   in air and in argon. The electrical properties of the films were studied
   as a function of annealing temperature and atmosphere. For the colloidal
   films, the effect of pre-annealing plasma treatments was also evaluated.
   Removal of the organic ligands from the colloidal films, in combination
   with annealing, resulted in over 8 orders of magnitude decrease in the
   film resistivity. It was found that plasma treatments were particularly
   effective in reducing film resistivity for low temperature annealed
   colloidal films. Results for the cold-sputtered films were for the most
   part as expected, with argon annealing resulting in lower resistivities
   than films annealed in air. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on numerically analyzing the thermal transport
   phenomena in the transient conjugate problem of melting and laminar film
   condensation. The key focus is to identify an optimum container aspect
   ratio/shape and conditions for which the heat storage time and the
   storage capacity are minimum and maximum respectively. Since most
   solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs) suffer from poor thermal
   conductivities, the major resistance to heat transfer comes from PCM.
   Hence, high thermal conductivity, low-cost metal foam is suggested for
   use along with PCM to minimize this resistance. The conjugate transient
   problem of film condensation driven solid-liquid phase change of PCM
   impregnated inside porous metal foam is numerically analyzed. An
   effective heat capacity formulation is employed for modeling the
   transient PCM phase change in porous foam and is solved using finite
   element method. It is coupled with laminar film condensation on the
   outside of the storage container. The model is then used for selecting
   the best aspect ratio for thermal energy storage (TES) containers that
   enables to store comparatively the maximum heat. The results of the
   developed model showed that the major resistance to heat transfer and
   hence efficient thermal energy storage depends strongly on the aspect
   ratio of the PCM storage containers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The physical layer of optical access network is vulnerable to various
   attacks. As the dramatic increase of users and network capacity, the
   issue of physical-layer security becomes more and more important. This
   paper proposes a physical-enhanced secure strategy for orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing passive optical network (OFDM-PON) by
   employing frequency domain chaos scrambling. The Logistic map is adopted
   for the chaos mapping. The chaos scrambling strategy can dynamically
   allocate the scrambling matrices for different OFDM frames according to
   the initial condition, which enhance the confidentiality of the physical
   layer. A mathematical model of this secure system is derived firstly,
   which achieves a secure transmission at physical layer in OFDM-PON. The
   results from experimental implementation using Logistic mapped chaos
   scrambling are also given to further demonstrate the efficiency of this
   secure strategy. An 10.125 Gb/s 64QAM-OFDM data with Logistic mapped
   chaos scrambling are successfully transmitted over 25-km single mode
   fiber (SMF), and the experimental results show that proposed security
   scheme can protect the system from eavesdropper and attacker, while keep
   a good performance for the legal ONU. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{This paper reports the quantitative measurement of a full spectrum
   ofmechanical properties of fivefold twinned silver (Ag) nanowires (NWs),
   including Young's modulus, yield strength, and ultimate tensile
   strength. In-situ tensile testing of Ag NWs with diameters between 34
   and 130 nm was carried out inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
   Young's modulus, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength all
   increased as the NW diameter decreased. The maximum yield strength in
   our tests was found to be 2.64 GPa, which is about 50 times the bulk
   value and close to the theoretical value of Ag in the < 110 >
   orientation. The size effect in the yield strength is mainly due to the
   stiffening size effect in the Young's modulus. Yield strain scales
   reasonably well with the NW surface area, which reveals that yielding of
   Ag NWs is due to dislocation nucleation from surface sources. Pronounced
   strain hardening was observed for most NWs in our study. The strain
   hardening, which has not previously been reported for NWs, is mainly
   attributed to the presence of internal twin boundaries.}},

Title = {{Shifting from Population-wide to Personalized Cancer Prognosis with
   Microarrays}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{The era of personalized medicine for cancer therapeutics has taken an
   important step forward in making accurate prognoses for individual
   patients with the adoption of high-throughput microarray technology.
   However, microarray technology in cancer diagnosis or prognosis has been
   primarily used for the statistical evaluation of patient populations,
   and thus excludes inter-individual variability and patient-specific
   predictions. Here we propose a metric called clinical confidence that
   serves as a measure of prognostic reliability to facilitate the shift
   from population-wide to personalized cancer prognosis using
   microarray-based predictive models. The performance of sample-based
   models predicted with different clinical confidences was evaluated and
   compared systematically using three large clinical datasets studying the
   following cancers: breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma.
   Survival curves for patients, with different confidences, were also
   delineated. The results show that the clinical confidence metric
   separates patients with different prediction accuracies and survival
   times. Samples with high clinical confidence were likely to have
   accurate prognoses from predictive models. Moreover, patients with high
   clinical confidence would be expected to live for a notably longer or
   shorter time if their prognosis was good or grim based on the models,
   respectively. We conclude that clinical confidence could serve as a
   beneficial metric for personalized cancer prognosis prediction utilizing
   microarrays. Ascribing a confidence level to prognosis with the clinical
   confidence metric provides the clinician an objective, personalized
   basis for decisions, such as choosing the severity of the treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a quantitative analysis of the role played by
   poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) in seed-mediated growth of Ag nanocrystals.
   Starting from Ag nanocubes encased by \{100\} facets as the seeds, the
   resultant nanocrystals could take different shapes depending on the
   concentration of PVP in the solution. Tithe concentration was above a
   critical value, the seeds simply grew into larger cubes.still enclosed
   by.\{100\} facets. When the concentration fell below a critical value,
   the seeds would evolve into cuboctahedrons enclosed by a mix of \{100\}
   and \{111\} facets and eventually octahedrons completely covered by
   \{111\} facets. We derived the coverage density of PVP on Ag(100)
   surface by combining the results from two measurements: (i) cubic seeds
   were followed to grow at a fixed initial concentration of PVP to find
   out when \{111\} facets started to appear on the surface, and (ii) cubic
   seeds were allowed to grow at reduced initial concentrations of PVP to
   see at which concentration \{111\} facets started to appear from the
   very beginning. We could calculate the coverage density of PVP from the
   differences in PVP concentration and the total surface area of Ag
   nanocubes between these two samples. The coverage density was found to
   be 140 and 30 repeating units per nm(2) for PVP of 55 000 and 10 000
   g/mol in molecular weight, respectively, for cubic seeds of 40 nm in
   edge length. These values dropped slightly to 100 and 20 repeating units
   per nm2, respectively, when 100 nm Ag cubes were used as the seeds.}},

   first time that polymer thickness has been controlled in a surface

   controlled polymerizations. Polymer film thicknesses were regulated by
   the variation of the solution monomer concentration and ranged from 30

   manipulate their near surface composition and effective work function.
   Doped states of the P3MT film are maintained even after the sample is
   removed from solution and potential control confirming the robustness of
   the films. Such materials with controllable thicknesses and electronic

   annealed below and above the glass transition temperature (T-g). More
   specifically, C-13 relaxation time in the rotating frame, H-1-C-13

   analyzed using stretched exponentials which yielded characteristic time
   constants. The filled PET and PET annealed above T-g exhibited
   suppressed chain dynamics across the entire hertz to mid-kilohertz
   regime that were correlated with reduced CO2 and O-2 permeabilities.

Abstract = {{We have determined what makes the first monomer insertion (initiation)
   facile or slow for many homogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts.
   Specifically, we have developed the first comprehensive and
   mechanistically detailed quantitative structure-activity relationship
   (QSAR) that successfully predicts relative chain initiation to
   propagation rates for a large series of group 4 single-site olefin
   polymerization catalysts. This QSAR correctly predicts (a) whether
   initiation is facile or slow and (b) the k(i)/k(p) ratio for a catalyst
   family with slow initiation. Monomer concentration versus time profiles
   were measured for batch polymerization of 1-hexene catalyzed by 27
   CpTi(OAr)Me-2 and Cp{*}Zr(OC6H-2,3,5,6-Ph-4)J(2) (J = Me, CH2Ph)
   complexes activated with B(C6F5)(3). Comparison of DFT calculations to
   experimental data revealed that the underlying cause of slow versus
   facile initiation is the difference in docking site opening sizes
   between the initiation kinetically dominant ion pair (i-KDIP) and the
   propagation kinetically dominant ion pair (p-KDIP). Specifically,
   initiation is facile if the i-KDIP and p-KDIP have similar docking site
   opening sizes or the i-KDIP docking site opening is not small but slow
   if the i-KDIP has a small docking site opening and the p-KDIP has a much
   larger docking site opening. The ion pairing dynamics was strongly
   influenced by (a) the choice of solvent, (b) whether or not the catalyst
   exhibits opportunistic ligand coordination, and (c) the type of
   initiating group. DFT-computed transition states for selected systems
   confirmed the underlying chemical mechanism that gives rise to this
   QSAR.}},

Abstract = {{On March 11, 2011, a magnitude M(w) 9.0 earthquake occurred off the
   coast of Japan's Tohoku region causing catastrophic damage and loss of
   life. The tsunami flow velocity analysis focused on two survivor videos
   recorded from building rooftops at Kesennuma Bay along Japan's Sanriku
   coast. A terrestrial laser scanner was deployed at the locations of the
   tsunami eyewitness video recordings. The tsunami current velocities
   through the Kesennuma Bay are determined in a four step process. The
   LiDAR point clouds are used to calibrate the camera fields of view in
   real world coordinates. The motion of the camera during recordings was
   determined. The video images were rectified with direct linear
   transformation. Finally a cross-correlation based particle image
   velocimetry analysis was applied to the rectified video images to
   determine instantaneous tsunami flow velocity fields. The measured
   maximum tsunami height of 9 m in the Kesennuma Bay narrows were followed
   by maximum tsunami outflow currents of 11 m/s less than 10 minutes
   later. Citation: Fritz, H. M., D. A. Phillips, A. Okayasu, T. Shimozono,

Abstract = {{MgH2 is a prototypical light metal hydride, but it is too stable for use
   in practical hydrogen storage applications. Experiments with ball-milled
   MgH2-0.1TiH(2) have shown that the enthalpy of reaction of MgH2 in this
   mixture is lower than for bulk MgH2 (Lu, J. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc.
   2009, 131, 15843). We have explored the mechanism for this phenomenon
   using first-principles density functional theory calculations of
   MgH2/TiH2 interfaces. We found that epitaxial contact between MgH2 and
   TiH2 can be formed with strongly favorable interface formation energies.
   Similar epitaxial interfaces also exist for Mg and TiH2. The strain
   induced by TiH2(111) on MgH2 and Mg in these interfaces can reduce the
   enthalpy for H-2 release from MgH2.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is a small yet important biological messenger, which
   at sufficient concentrations has been shown to induce apoptosis as well

   agent. The objective of this study was the development of targeted NO
   donors and we illustrate their utility as a potential therapeutic for
   treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive
   malignant primary brain tumor in adults. We have synthesized two
   diazeniumdiolate NO donors by reacting NO gas with glioma-specific
   targeting sequences, VTWTPQAWFQWVGGGSKKKKK (VTW) and chlorotoxin (CTX),
   and achieved repeatable NO release from both donors. FITC-labeled
   biomolecules, when incubated with glioma and control cells
   preferentially bound to the glioma cells and showed only minimal binding
   to the control cells. Additionally, tumor cell viability was
   significantly decreased when cells were incubated with the NO donors
   whereas control cell viability was not affected. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy control application to support a
   vendor managed inventory (VMI). The methodology applies fuzzy control to
   generate an adaptive smoothing constant in the forecast method,
   production and delivery plan to eliminate, for example, the rationing
   and gaming or the Houlihan effect and the order batching effect or the
   Burbidge effects and finally the Bullwhip effect. The results show that
   the adaptive fuzzy VMI control surpasses fuzzy VMI control and
   traditional VMI in terms of mitigating the Bullwhip effect and lower
   delivery overshoots and backorders. This paper also guides management in
   allocating inventory by coordinating suppliers and buyers to ensure
   minimum inventory levels across a supply chain. Adaptive fuzzy VMI
   control is the main contribution of this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A class of {[}5,5']-diphenyl-{[}5,5']-dithiophene (PTTP)modified
   methacrylates has been synthesized and free radically polymerized to
   form graft polymethacrylates with the conducting PTTP segments as
   pendant side chains. Both the terminal alkyl side chain and spacer
   between the PTTP segments and polymer backbone could be varied to study
   fundamental structure-property relationships for this class of
   materials. Specifically, a group of three different PTTP graft
   polymethacrylates has been successfully synthesized with the alkyl side
   chain varying from hexyl to dodecyl. For the dodecyl-terminated
   poly(4-(5'-(4-dodecylphenyl)-{[}2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl) phenethyl
   methacrylate), p(DPTTPEM), a counterpart,
   poly(4-(5'-(4-dodecylphenyl)-{[}2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)phenbutyl
   methacrylate), p(DPTTPBM), where the ethyl spacer was replaced by a
   butyl group, was synthesized. The experimental results indicated that
   both the alkyl side chain and spacer significantly affected the
   reactivity of the PTTP-modified methacrylates during free radical
   polymerization as well as the physical properties of the resultant graft
   polymers including solubility, morphology, and electrochemical and
   electrical properties. Typical field-effect mobilities on the order of
   10(-5) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) were observed for all the PTTP monomers in air,
   which was attributed to their crystalline phase as revealed by
   differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies. (C)

Abstract = {{Current lithium-ion batteries (LiB) have limited usefulness in high
   temperature applications due to the flammability of the organic
   electrolyte. Alternatively, solid electrolytes can mitigate safety
   issues and enable high temperature applications. Here, a new solid-state
   lithium ion battery design is investigated using LiSICON as the
   electrolyte. To reduce the interfacial resistance between the solid
   electrolyte and graphite electrode, an ionic liquid was used as the
   ionic conductor. N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
   (PYR(13)(+)FSI(-)) was used as the ionic liquid due to its high
   efficiency for lithiation/delithiaion. The cell capacity and efficiency
   was measured at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 120 degrees C. The
   lithium salt concentration in the ionic liquid was found to change the
   electrolyte reduction potential. A stable solid electrolyte interface
   (SEI) was achieved by adjusting the lithium salt concentration in the
   wetting agent. Impedance spectroscopy was performed to study the cell
   behavior with different Li salt concentrations at elevated temperature.
   A carbon anode in a LiSICON cell with 0.75 M LiTFSI/PYR(13)(+)FSI(-) had
   a capacity of 325 mAh g(-1) and coulombic efficiency of 99.8\% during
   cycling at 80 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dual-task motor performance with a tongue-operated assistive technology
   compared with hand operations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: To provide an alternative motor modality for control,
   navigation, and communication in individuals suffering from impairment
   or disability in hand functions, a Tongue Drive System (TDS) has been
   developed that allows for real time tracking of tongue motion in an
   unobtrusive, wireless, and wearable device that utilizes the magnetic
   field generated by a miniature disk shaped magnetic tracer attached to
   the tip of the tongue. The purpose of the study was to compare the
   influence of a concurrent motor or cognitive task on various aspects of
   simple movement control between hand and tongue using the TDS
   technology.
   Methods: Thirteen young able-bodied adults performed rapid and slow
   goal-directed movements of hand and tongue (with TDS) with and without a
   concurrent motor (hand or tongue) or cognitive (arithmetic and memory)
   task. Changes in reaction time, completion time, speed, correctness,
   accuracy, variability of displacement, and variability of time due to
   the addition of a concurrent task were compared between hand and tongue.
   Results: The influence of an additional concurrent task on motor
   performance was similar between the hand and tongue for slow movement in
   controlling their displacement. In rapid movement with a concurrent
   motor task, most aspects of motor performance were degraded in hand,
   while tongue speed during rapid continuous task was maintained. With a
   concurrent cognitive task, most aspects of motor performance were
   degraded in tongue, while hand accuracy during the rapid discrete task
   and hand speed during the rapid continuous task were maintained.
   Conclusion: Rapid goal-directed hand and tongue movements were more
   consistently susceptible to interference from concurrent motor and
   cognitive tasks, respectively, compared with the other movement.}},

   silica nanospheres and laser interference lithography is presented.
   Monolayers of close-packed silica nanospheres (800, 600, and 430 nm in
   diameter) are self-assembled on 2 mu m thick PEDOT-PSS
   electropolymerized films and are subsequently irradiated with 10 ns
   pulses of 355 nm wavelength laser light. Over areas spanning 2 cm(2),
   circular nano-cavities with central holes of size 50-200 nm and
   surrounding craters of size 100-400 nm are formed in the PEDOT-PSS films
   directly underneath the nanospheres due to strong enhancement (11-18
   fold) of the incident light in the near-field, which is confirmed
   through Mie scattering theory. Predictions from theoretical simulations
   examining the combined effects of near-field enhancement and
   interference are in good agreement with the experimental results. The

Abstract = {{Contamination of metal films by sulfur-containing compounds presents a
   major challenge to using metal membranes for H-2 purification in
   processes involving large-scale gasification of coal or biomass.
   Formation of bulk sulfide phases in these applications is typically
   associated with irreversible loss of performance and ultimately membrane
   failure. The concept of using metal alloys to reduce sensitivity to
   sulfide formation has been explored in a variety of experiments, but
   development of alloys for this purpose has been hampered by a lack of
   thermodynamic data on formation of the relevant sulfide phases. We show
   that first principles calculations using density functional theory can
   be used to predict the formation of bulk sulfide phases from metal
   alloys under conditions that are relevant for operation of metal
   membranes. Our methods are illustrated by assessing the formation of
   sulfides for PdAg, PdAu, and PdCu alloys of all possible binary
   compositions.}},

   substantial recovery of the sensible heat capacity of the beds, thus
   reducing energy costs of the thermal-swing adsorption process.}},

Abstract = {{Improvement in the efficiency of CO(2) separation from flue gases is a
   high-priority research area to reduce the total energy cost of carbon
   capture and sequestration technologies in coal-fired power plants.
   Efficient CO(2) removal from flue gases by adsorption systems requires
   the design of novel sorbents capable of capturing, concentrating, and
   recovering CO(2) on a cost-effective basis. This paper describes the
   preparation of an aminosilane-functionalized cellulosic polymer sorbent
   with enhanced CO(2) sorption capacity and promising performance for use
   in postcombustion carbon capture via rapid temperature-swing adsorption
   systems. The introduction of aminosilane functionalities onto the
   backbone of cellulose acetate was achieved by the anhydrous grafting of
   N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminoisobutyldimethylmethoxysilane. The dry sorption
   capacity of the modified cellulosic polymer reached 27 cc (STP) CO(2)/cc
   sorbent (1.01 mmol/g sorbent) at 1 atm and 39 cc (STP) CO(2)/cc sorbent
   (1.46 mmol/g sorbent) at 5 atm and 308 K. The amine loading achieved was
   5.18 mmol amine (nitrogen)/g sorbent. Exposure to water vapor after the
   first dry sorption cycle increased the dry sorption capacity of the
   sorbent by 12\% at 1 atm, suggesting its potential for rapid cydic
   adsorption processes under humid feed conditions. The CO(2) sorbent was
   characterized in terms of chemical composition, density changes,
   molecular structure, thermal stability, and surface morphology.}},

Title = {{Effect of Precursor-Layer Surface Charge on the Layer-by-Layer Assembly

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{In this Article, we investigate the effect of a precursor layer, which
   is composed of four bilayers of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly(sodium
   styrene sulfonate) (PSS), on the subsequent LBL assembly of hybrid films
   composed of indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles and PSS. A precursor
   polyelectrolyte layer is usually deposited to minimize interference by
   the substrate. It is shown here that the ``effective{''} surface charge
   of the precursor layer can significantly affect the subsequent assembly
   behavior of {[}ITO/PSS](9.5) hybrid thin films. Depending on the surface
   charge of the precursor layer, the subsequent LbL assembly of
   {[}ITO/PSS](9.5) hybrid films can exhibit either one or two regimes.
   When two growth regimes are present, the first one consists of a
   ``recovery regime{''}, and the second is the expected ``linear growth
   regime.{''} The length of the ``recovery regime{''} is dependent on how
   much positive charge the precursor layer possesses and how fast this
   surface charge can be compensated. This work reveals for the first time
   that changes in the surface charge of the precursor layer can have a
   significant effect on the subsequent LBL assembly process. The surface
   charge of the precursor layer was investigated using zeta-potential
   measurements on model silica microspheres. These experiments showed that
   the surface charge of the precursor layer, {[}PEI/PSS](4), is dependent
   on the pH of the solution in which it is immersed, and that it can
   reverse from a negatively charged surface to a positively charged one,
   at sufficiently low pH due to the protonation of PEI, despite having the
   negatively charged PSS layer as the outermost layer.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporation of selected low molecular weight diluents (LMWDs) into
   poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) significantly improves oxygen and
   carbon dioxide barrier properties. A so-called Barrier Improvement
   Factor (BIF), defined as the ratio of permeability of pure polymer to
   that of antiplasticized polymer, provides a useful indication of
   improved barrier properties. The average BIF was found to be 1.20 (+/-
   0.02) and 1.34 (+/- 0.03) for O-2 and 1.25 (+/- 0.01) and 1.41 (+/-
   0.01) for CO2 in PET containing - 2.32\% phenacetin, or 1.95\%
   acetanilide, respectively. The reduced permeability coefficient in each
   PET sample is attributed to antiplasticization, and justified by the
   combination of the effect of reduced free volume and the interaction
   energies of PET with LMWDs. A more compatible interaction of PET with
   acetanilide may require higher activation energy for diffusional jump
   resulting in more reduction in permeability even though both PET-2.32\%
   phenacetin and PET-1.95\% acetanilide showed an equal level of reduction
   in free volume. Solid-state C-13 cross polarization magic angle spinning
   (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra verified a reduction
   in the localized chain mobility of carbonyl carbon of PET in both
   PET-2.32\% phenacetin and PET-1.95\% acetanilide. Furthermore, the
   dynamic mechanical property measurement in the low temperature region
   verifies that the presence of LMWDs reduced the low temperature beta
   relaxation in PET. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to explain the dielectrophoretic behavior of ethanol suspended
   tin oxide (SnO2) nanobelts observed experimentally, modeling of the ac
   dielectrophoresis (DEP) phenomenon is carried out. Nanobelts are a type
   of ribbon like semiconducting oxide nanowire with rectangular
   cross-sections. To calculate the DEP induced forces and torques the
   Maxwell stress tensor (MST) approach is used. DEP experiments have
   indicated negative DEP (repulsion) in the low frequency range (<100 kHz)
   and positive DEP (attraction) in the high frequency range (similar to
   1-10 MHz) of the applied ac electric field. The experimentally observed
   DEP characteristic is unusual if the nanobelt is treated as possessing
   uniform bulk material electrical properties of tin oxide. Several
   different nanobelt models are studied using simulations to explain the
   unusual behavior. The model providing the best explanation is the one
   where the nanobelt has an electrically conductive interior and a
   non-conductive outer layer, depleted of charge carriers. This is
   consistent with the surface depletion phenomenon commonly observed in
   SnO2 and other semiconducting metal oxide materials. This work
   demonstrates the importance of surface dominant properties of
   nanostructures in DEP manipulation and assembly. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This work presents the design and implementation of a compact,
   three-pole, bandpass filter at 9.75 GHz using evanescent-mode,
   quartz-loaded, rectangular-waveguide resonators arranged in a novel
   manufacturing topology. The simplicity of the proposed design results in
   a fast and low-cost manufacturing process, which is easily extendible
   for high-yield commercial deployment using wire electrical discharge
   machining. Additionally, a new figure of merit is introduced to compare
   the compactness and performance of the proposed filter to other cavity
   filters. Finally, measurements showed a center-frequency insertion loss
   of 0.53 dB, a 0.2 dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 5.9\%, and a
   side-band rejection better than 20 dB at FBW = 25\%. The prototype was
   realized in a brass housing that occupies a total volume of 8.27 cm(3)
   (0.51 cubic inches).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate the design and development of a low-cost,
   self-powered, wireless sensor solution based on the WISP platform and
   utilizing thin films produced from environmentally friendly,
   water-based, inkjet printed graphene oxide (GO) ink. The sensor
   demonstrates good response to ammonia gas (NH3), yielding a 6\%
   normalized resistance change within 15 minutes after exposure to a
   concentration of 500 ppm. In addition, excellent recovery time is
   achieved using the graphene thin films, with over 30\% of material
   recovery observed within 5 minutes without exposure to high temperature
   or any UV treatments. In addition to reporting the first ever
   integration of inkjet-printed water soluble GO inks into low cost RF
   electronics fabricated on flexible substrates, we also bring gas sensing
   capabilities to RFID tags relying on purely wireless digital
   transmission of the sensed information. The introduction of mass
   producible, stable, environmentally friendly, inkjet printable GO on
   organic paper/Kapton substrates lays the foundation for the development
   of a wide range of new low-cost, high performance graphene-based
   devices, such as inkjet-printed diodes, capacitors and transistors.}},

   setting depends on the underlying graph structure of the network. This
   paper provides an analysis of the assignment of multiple resources to
   nodes and the effect of these assignments on the overall heterogeneity

Abstract = {{This paper describes an adaptive-precision algorithm for solving a
   general optimal mode-scheduling problem in switched-mode dynamical
   systems. The problem is complicated by the fact that the controlled
   variable has discrete and continuous components, namely the sequence of
   modes and the switching times between them. Recently we developed a
   gradient-descent algorithm whose salient feature is that its descent at
   a given iteration is independent of the length (number of modes) of the
   schedule, hence it is suitable to situations where the schedule-lengths
   at successive iterations grow unboundedly. The computation of the
   descent direction requires grid-based approximations to solve
   differential equations as well as minimize certain functions on
   uncountable sets. However, the algorithm's convergence analysis assumes
   exact computations, and it breaks down when approximations are used,
   because the descent directions are discontinuous in the problem
   parameters. The purpose of the present paper is to overcome this
   theoretical gap and its computational implications by developing an
   implementable, provably-convergent, adaptive-precision algorithm that
   controls the approximation levels by balancing precision with
   computational workloads.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a cooperative control architecture for
   high-order multivehicle systems having nonidentical nonlinear uncertain
   dynamics. For each vehicle, the proposed methodology consists of a local
   cooperative controller and a vehicle-level controller. The former
   controller receives the relative output measurements of the neighboring
   vehicles in order to solve a containment problem formulated on a
   leader-follower framework. In particular, the leaders generate a
   trajectory in which the vehicles (followers) converge to the convex hull
   formed by those of the leaders. For a special case with one leader, this
   controller synchronizes the output of the vehicles with the output of
   the leader. The latter controller receives the internal state
   measurements for suppressing the nonlinear uncertain dynamics of the
   vehicle by using a decentralized robust adaptive control approach. The
   interaction topology between vehicles is described by undirected graphs,
   and extensions to directed graphs are further discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurochemistry
   there has been impressive progress in the understanding of the molecular
   properties of anesthetic agents. However, despite these advances, we
   still do not understand how anesthetic agents affect the properties of
   neurons that translate into the induction of general anesthesia at the
   macroscopic level. There is extensive experimental verification that
   collections of neurons may function as oscillators and the
   synchronization of oscillators may play a key role in the transmission
   of information within the central nervous system. This may be
   particularly relevant to understanding the mechanism of action for
   general anesthesia. In this paper, we develop a stochastic synaptic
   drive firing rate model for an excitatory and inhibitory cortical
   neuronal network in the face of system time delays. In addition, we

Abstract = {{With the advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurochemistry
   there has been impressive progress in understanding the molecular
   properties of anesthetic agents. However, there has been little focus on
   how the molecular properties of anesthetic agents lead to the observed
   macroscopic property that defines the anesthetic state, that is, lack of
   responsiveness to noxious stimuli. In this paper, we develop a mean
   field synaptic firing rate cortical neuronal model and demonstrate how
   the induction of general anesthesia can be explained using
   multistability; the property whereby the solutions of a dynamical system
   exhibit multiple attracting equilibria under asymptotically slowly
   changing inputs or system parameters. In particular, we demonstrate
   multistability in the mean when the system initial conditions or the
   system coefficients of the neuronal connectivity matrix are random
   variables. Uncertainty in the system coefficients is captured by
   representing system uncertain parameters by a multiplicative white noise
   model wherein stochastic integration is interpreted in the sense of Ito.
   Modeling a priori system parameter uncertainty using a multiplicative
   white noise model is motivated by means of the Maximum Entropy Principle
   of Jaynes and statistical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We address the semantic gap between the model and the implementation of
   control algorithms for distributed systems in a formal fashion: we
   provide an interactive (partially automated) method by which to
   translate the global, model level theoretical properties, such as
   stability and convergence, into code level assertions and invariants
   which assure termination of the relevant implementations and validity of
   the result. We outline a simple flight control system example for
   altitude holding, and describe a fault-tolerant distributed agreement
   protocol among n processor nodes, in the presence of a varying network
   topology. We develop a Lyapunov-like function for the distributed
   algorithm, and attain a polynomial time theoretical bound on the
   convergence time T-conv proportional to n(3). We then exploit the
   Lyapunov function and convergence proof, in order to derive requisite
   ANSI-C Specification Language (ACSL) annotations for the C code
   distributed implementation, in order to guarantee termination. The ACSL
   annotations can then be used to automatically generate formal proof
   obligations via the Frama-C tool. These proof obligations also encompass
   assertions relating to timing, memory allocation, type checking and
   processor specific issues. The proof obligations can then be
   automatically discharged using a theorem prover, and their success
   guarantees that the behavior of the corresponding distributed code will
   evince the global properties proven for the model. Thus, the
   verification process spans efforts from the high-level control theory to
   the low-level implementation as a C program.}},

Abstract = {{A suboptimal state estimation algorithm is proposed for a discrete time
   stochastic multi-mode switched system, with a finite number of modes.
   The system state is transferred from one mode to the next. The
   parameters in the different modes are assumed to be known, but the
   mode-switching is random. The proposed filter is derived by extending
   the innovations approach to the problem of estimating the state of the
   system assuming that the switch between modes is purely random, but with
   known mode probabilities. As a special case we derive the filter for a
   linear system degraded by intermittent sensor failure and analyze its
   performance. This model is an alternative to the packet loss model,
   where the presence or absence of a packet is part of the observed data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop dissipativity notions for dynamical systems

   particular, we introduce a generalized definition of dissipativity for

   and set-valued storage maps consisting of locally Lebesgue integrable
   supply rates and Lipschitz continuous storage functions, respectively.
   Moreover, extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions, in terms of the
   discontinuous system dynamics, characterizing dissipativity via
   generalized Clarke gradients and locally Lipschitz continuous storage
   functions are derived. Finally, these results are used to develop

Abstract = {{Reversibility of dynamical processes arises in many physical dynamical
   systems. For example, lossless Newtonian and Hamiltonian mechanical
   systems exhibit trajectories that can be obtained by time going forward
   and backward, providing an example of time symmetry that arises in
   natural sciences. Another example of such time symmetry is the
   phenomenon known as Poincare recurrence wherein the dynamical system
   exhibits trajectories that return infinitely often to neighborhoods of
   their initial conditions. In this paper, we study output reversibility
   in linear dynamical systems, that is, the backward recoverability of the
   system output while time is going forward. Specifically, we provide
   necessary and sufficient conditions for output reversibility in terms of
   the spectrum of the system dynamics. In addition, we provide sufficient
   conditions for the absence of output reversibility. Furthermore, we
   establish that no system trajectory can retrace its time history
   backwards with time going forward which is also natural in light of the
   uniqueness of solutions to linear dynamical systems. Finally, we draw
   connections between output reversibility and Poincare recurrence.}},

   We introduce concepts of coherent steps and incoherent steps of the
   sensing agents and prove that a step of an agent is coherent if and only
   if the probability of a false-walk is less than a threshold determined
   by the explorable probability. Among all possible coherent steps,
   gradient climbing and level curve tracking are the steps that can
   achieve local supremum explorable probabilities. We also prove that by
   increasing the number of agents that are collaborating, the incoherent
   steps of the collaborating groups can become coherent. Based on
   estimates of the noise variance, we propose an algorithm that estimates
   the minimum number of agents required to guarantee coherent steps and
   implement a strategy that allows the sensing agents to self-organize

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new adaptive control architecture for nonlinear
   uncertain dynamical systems is developed to address the problem of
   high-gain adaptive control. Specifically, the proposed framework
   involves a new and novel controller architecture involving a
   modification term in the update law that minimizes an error criterion
   involving the distance between the weighted regressor vector and the
   weighted system error states. This modification term allows for fast
   adaptation without hindering system robustness. In particular, we show
   that the governing tracking closed-loop system error equation
   approximates a Hurwitz linear time-invariant dynamical system with
   L-infinity input-output signals. This key feature of our framework
   allows for robust stability analysis of the proposed adaptive control
   law using L-1 system theory. We further show that by properly choosing
   the design parameters in the modification term we can guarantee a
   desired bandwidth of the adaptive controller, guaranteed transient
   closed-loop performance, and an a priori characterization of the size of
   the ultimate bound of the closed-loop system trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a new control framework for nonlinear
   uncertain dynamical systems. The proposed methodology consists of a
   novel command governor architecture and an adaptive controller. The
   command governor is a linear dynamical system which adjusts the
   trajectory of a given command to follow an ideal reference system
   capturing a desired closed-loop dynamical system behavior in transient
   time. Specifically, we show that the controlled nonlinear uncertain
   dynamical system approximates the ideal reference system by properly
   choosing the design parameter of the command governor. In addition, the
   purpose of the adaptive controller is to asymptotically assure that the
   error between the controlled nonlinear uncertain dynamical system and
   the ideal reference system vanishes in steady state. Therefore, the
   proposed methodology not only has closed-loop transient and steady state
   performance guarantees but can also shape the transient response by
   adjusting the trajectory of the given command with the command governor.
   We highlight that there exists a trade-off between the adaptive
   controller's learning rate and the command governor's design parameter.
   This key feature of our framework allows rapid suppression of system
   uncertainties without resorting to a high learning rate in the adaptive
   controller. Furthermore, we discuss the robustness properties of the
   proposed approach with respect to high-frequency dynamical system
   content such as measurement noise and/or unmodeled dynamics.}},

   by providing (i) succinct conditions regarding the possibility of
   expressing the aforementioned classifier as a set of linear inequalities

   target DAP with minimum run-time computational overhead, in the case
   that a linear-classifier-based representation of this policy is not

Abstract = {{This paper presents an online controller for regulating the throughput
   of instruction-sequences in multicore processors using dynamic
   voltage-frequency scaling. The proposed control law comprises an
   integral controller whose gain is adjusted online based on the
   derivative of the frequency-throughput relationship. This relationship
   is modeled as a stochastic DEDS having no analytic functional form, and
   hence its derivative is estimated by Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis
   (IPA). However, the DEDS is multi-class and hence the IPA derivative is
   biased.
   Biasedness of IPA is a common problem in multi-class DEDS which has
   hindered the development of IPA as a general tool for practical
   applications. However, recently it has been suggested that as long as
   the relative bias has certain upper bounds, optimization algorithms and
   control laws can still converge to optimal or near-optimal parameters.
   The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate this point for the
   aforementioned problem of throughput regulation, thereby suggesting the
   potential emergence of a new class of effective control laws in computer
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Stable games {[}1] have the attractive property of admitting global
   convergence to equilibria under many learning dynamics. We show that
   stable games can be formulated as passive input-output systems. This
   observation enables us to identify passivity of a learning dynamic as a
   sufficient condition for global convergence in stable games. Notably,
   dynamics satisfying our condition need not exhibit positive correlation
   between the payoffs and their directions of motion. Our condition is
   satisfied by the dynamics known to exhibit global convergence in stable
   games. We give a decision-theoretic interpretation for passive learning
   dynamics that mirrors the interpretation of stable games as strategic
   environments exhibiting self-defeating externalities. Lastly, we exploit
   the flexibility of the passivity condition to study the impact of
   applying various forecasting heuristics to the payoffs used in the
   learning process.}},

Abstract = {{In a repeated zero-sum game, two players repeatedly play the same
   zero-sum game over several stages. We assume that while both players can
   observe the actions of the other, only one player knows the actual game,
   which was randomly selected from a set of possible games according to a
   known distribution. The dilemma faced by the informed player is how to
   trade off the short-term reward versus long-term consequence of
   exploiting information, since exploitation also risks revelation.
   Classic work by Aumann and Maschler derives the recursive value
   equation, which quantifies this tradeoff and derives a formula for
   optimal policies by the informed player. However, using this model for
   explicit computations can be computationally prohibitive as the number
   of game stages increases. In this paper, we derive a suboptimal policy
   based on the concept of policy improvement. The baseline policy is a
   non-revealing policy, i.e., one that completely ignores superior
   information. The improved policy, which is implemented in a receding
   horizon manner, strategizes for the current stage while assuming a
   non-revealing policy for future stages. We show that the improved policy
   can be computed by solving a linear program, and the computational
   complexity of this linear program is constant with respect to the length
   of the game. We derive bounds on the guaranteed performance of the
   improved policy and establish that the bounds are tight.}},

Abstract = {{A transient transmit model has been developed to investigate and
   optimize output pressure characteristics of a CMUT array element in
   non-collapse mode. The model uses SIMULINK to calculate transient output
   pressure from a CMUT array element given the input voltage waveform. The
   model has a nonlinear block for electrostatic actuation, and two linear
   blocks for force to membrane displacement and force to pressure
   calculations. Force to displacement transfer functions are obtained
   using the boundary element method which accounts for membrane dynamics
   including acoustic cross coupling in the array and provides surface
   velocity distribution for pressure calculation more efficiently as
   compared to FEA. Using the model, the transient transmitted pressure can
   be simulated for various pulse amplitude and DC bias configurations for
   CMUT optimization and phased array operation. The model is verified on a
   2 by 2 CMUT array which is simulated both with transient FEA and the
   SIMULINK model. This type of model would be useful for designing a CMUT
   element optimized for maximum output pressure given input signal
   constraints and a desired frequency response. As an example, the optimal
   pulse width and DC bias to maximize the output pressure of a
   CMUT-on-CMOS dual-ring array element are calculated for given device
   geometry and constrained drive pulse amplitude of 25 V.}},

Abstract = {{Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of CMUT arrays offers flexibility with
   membrane geometry, but it can become computationally expensive as the
   transducer array and fluidic space increases in size. The objective is
   to combine the modeling flexibility of 3D FEA with the computational
   effectiveness of 2D numerical methods to analyze and design CMUT arrays
   with arbitrary membrane shapes. Effective numerical methods for CMUT
   arrays combine finite difference (FD) approximations of thin plate
   equations with fluid coupling through the use of the Boundary Element
   Method. As such, the array can be modeled with a 2D surface mesh, but
   the thin plate approximations limit the analysis to CMUTs with high
   aspect ratios and uniform surfaces. A hybrid method using static FEA
   (COMSOL 4.2a) of an individual CMUT membrane was used to generate an
   equivalent stiffness matrix associated with the mesh density of the 2D
   surface, eliminating the dependence on the thin plate approximation.
   This FEA need only be performed once for a given geometry and mesh
   density as it is reused for an entire array. The resonant frequency of
   square CMUTs with 2 mu m thickness in vacuum was evaluated using FD and
   hybrid methods. The hybrid method shows good agreement with full FEA,
   while the FD method deviated for low aspect ratios. Hybrid analysis of
   mass-loaded CMUTs with an aluminum electrode for operation at similar to
   40 MHz shows good agreement FEA analysis while reducing the computation
   time by a factor of 20 for a simple array simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Directional inspection using guided waves (GWs) is a convenient approach
   for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of large 2D regions. While beam
   steering is conventionally achieved through phased arrays, often at the
   cost of a considerable hardware and software complexity, a single,
   differential-channel actuator is employed in this work to send GWs in
   arbitrary directions by properly choosing the excitation frequency. This
   frequency-steerable directional scanning is achieved through an
   angle-dependent wavelength tuning provided by the peculiar shape of the
   piezoelectric patch which forms the transducer. Although the underlying
   theoretical framework of Frequency-Steerable Acoustic Transducers
   (FSATs) encompasses both directional generation and sensing of GWs,
   directional actuation has only been predicted by simulations so far.
   This paper presents for the first time an experimental study of
   directional GW generation on an aluminum plate through an FSAT
   fabricated by inkjet printing of the electrodes on a PVDF substrate and

   using total variation (TV). The CS reconstruction is formulated as
   either a constrained problem to minimize the TV objective within a small
   data fidelity error, or an unconstrained problem to minimize the data
   fidelity error with TV regularization. However, the conventional
   solutions to the above two formulations are either computationally
   inefficient or involved with inconsistent regularization parameter
   tuning. In this work, we propose an optimization algorithm for cone-beam
   CT (CBCT) CS reconstruction which overcomes the above two drawbacks.
   The data tolerance is well estimated using the measured data, as most of
   the projection errors are from Poisson noise. We adopt the TV
   optimization framework with data fidelity as constraints. To accelerate
   the convergence, we first convert such a constrained optimization using
   a barrier method into a similar form to the conventional
   TV-regularization reconstruction but with an automatically adjusted
   penalty weight. The problem is then solved efficiently by gradient
   projection. The proposed algorithm is referred to as Accelerated Barrier
   Optimization for CS (ABOCS).
   As demonstrated on Shepp-Logan and head phantoms, ABOCS achieves
   consistent performances using the same parameters on scans with
   different datasets, while the TV-regularization method needs a
   large-scale tuning on the penalty weight. ABOCS also requires less
   computation time than ASD-POCS in Matlab by more than 10 times. ABOCS is
   further accelerated on GPU to reconstruct a 3D Shepp-Logan volume of
   256x256x256 voxels in less than 20 mins using 10\% projections, and the
   image quality is comparable to that of the full-view FDK reconstruction.
   We propose ABOCS for CBCT reconstruction. As compared to other published
   CS-based algorithms, our method has attractive features of fast
   convergence and consistent parameter setting for different datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Cone-beam CT (CBCT) applications in radiation therapy are limited by
   excessive imaging dose from repeated scans and poor image quality mainly
   due to scatter contamination. Recently, we develop a Compressed Sensing
   (CS) reconstruction algorithm (referred to as Accelerated Barrier
   Optimization for CS (ABOCS) with the features of fast convergence and
   consistent parameter tuning. ABOCS has shown promises in recovering
   faithful signals from low-dose projection data, but does not serve well
   the needs of quantitative CBCT imaging if effective shading correction
   is not in place. In the meanwhile, our quantitative CBCT imaging scheme
   uses the planning CT (pCT) as the prior and successfully suppresses the
   shading artifacts, but requires a large number of projections for an
   accurate FBP reconstruction. In this work, we propose a low-dose
   quantitative CBCT imaging strategy by combining the merits of ABOCS
   reconstruction and the pCT-based shading correction.
   We lower the CBCT dose by reducing the number of projections. The
   shading artifacts have been effectively removed using the pCT-based
   quantitative CBCT imaging scheme. The streaking artifacts due to view
   aliasing and high noise level are greatly suppressed using the ABOCS
   reconstruction which is based on the TV optimization framework with data
   fidelity errors as the constraints.
   As demonstrated on a pelvis patient study, the number of projections is
   reduced to only 25\%. The mean CT number error is reduced to be less
   than 15 HU in the selected regions of interest. Using 25\% data, ABOCS
   still successfully achieves a comparable image quality (e.g., spatial
   non-uniformity and soft-tissue contrast) to that using FBP
   reconstruction on the full data set after an effective pCT-based shading
   correction.
   We propose a low-dose quantitative CBCT imaging scheme using 25\% normal
   dose to achieve a less than 15 HU CT-number error. This method combines
   the benefits of CS reconstruction and shading correction, which is
   promising for clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrated a novel approach to synthesize flexible isotropic
   conductive adhesives (ICAs) that can not only withstand a high
   deformation rate but also exhibit superior electrical conductivity and
   adhesion strength. The ICA is made of polyurethane (PU) filled with
   silver flakes. It can achieve resistivity as low as 1.1 x 10(-5)
   Omega.cm at 80 wt.\% loadings, which is even better than most solders.
   The high electrical conductivity results from 1) large shrinkage of the
   PU matrix during cuing; 2) the in-situ reduction of the silver
   carboxylate layer present on the surface of silver flakes by the
   selected curing agent so that direct metallic contact can be formed
   between silver flakes; 3) the microphase separation that is unique to PU
   matrix providing more conduction paths. The combination of the three
   above effects leads to the superior electrical conductivity that can be
   rarely seen in other ICA materials at equivalent loading level. In terms
   of adhesion, lap shear test measurements show that the adhesion strength
   to Cu surfaces at room temperature can reach 0.12 kg/mm(2) at 80 wt\%
   loading, equivalent to some epoxy based ICAs reported before. In
   addition, the developed ICAs have also demonstrated other advantages
   such as a low curing temperature, which enable them to be printed on low
   cost and flexible substrates such as paper and fabrics; simple and
   cost-effective processing, eliminating the usage of Ag nanoparticles to
   achieve high electrical conductivity; and good bio-compatibility. These
   superior material properties combined with low cost and simple
   processing make it very promising for emerging flexible electronics. A
   wearable antenna fabricated by printing the PU based ICAs on flexible
   fabrics was also presented as a demonstration of such devices.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen-related border traps cause low-frequency excess (1/f) noise in
   MOS transistors with SiO2 gate dielectrics and GaN/AlGaN HEMTs. In each
   case, the noise is associated with a reconfiguration of the
   microstructure of near-interfacial defects upon charge capture. O
   vacancies in the near-interfacial SiO2 capture electrons when Si-Si
   bonds are stretched beyond their equilibrium length, and release
   electrons when the defect relaxes. These lead to MOS noise at room
   temperature. Oxygen DX centers in AlGaN exhibit metastable states that
   differ in energy by similar to 0.2 eV, which leads to increased noise in
   GaN/AlGaN HEMTs at cryogenic temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field which
   offers a promising new technology to create artificial constructs for
   regeneration of tissues. One important aspect of bone tissue engineering
   is to build scaffolds with interconnected 3-D porous structure in order
   to mimic natural bone architecture. In this work, co-continuous
   micro-porous scaffolds made of Poly-L-actic acid (PLLA) with 50\%
   porosity and PLLA/hydroxyapatite (HA) with 40\% porosity were prepared
   by injection molding of an immiscible polymer blend with polystyrene as
   sacrificial material. The sacrificial material was then removed by
   solvent leaching with cyclohexane. The porous PLLA/HA matrix supported
   murine osteoblast (7F2) cell growth for up to 9 days, suggesting that
   that the introduction and replacement of sacrificial material had no
   negative effects on cell proliferation. In vitro studies also indicate
   an increase in mineralization by osteoblasts cultured on the porous
   structure, as compared to cells cultured on solid scaffold. One month
   subcutaneous degradation tests showed a mild foreign body reaction and
   complete fibrous encapsulation. Following surgical implantation of the
   scaffolds into circular defects in canine tibia, we observed after 12
   weeks new bone tissue grew into the porous structures. Taken together
   our data suggest that interconnected porous structures with good
   cytocompatibility and increased mineralization in vitro paired with
   enhanced osteoinductive properties in vivo suggest a great potential of
   the porous PLLA/HA for inducing and sustaining bone tissue repair.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{Presidential Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice (EJ) was
   signed in 1994, and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued
   regulatory guidelines for addressing EJ in transportation in 1997.
   Transportation agencies have since adopted a range of policies,
   programs, and activities to identify and address disproportionately high
   and adverse human health and environmental effects of their policies,
   programs, and activities on minority and low-income populations. On the
   basis of the relevant literature and structured interviews, this paper
   assesses how state DOTs are addressing EJ issues in their
   decision-making processes and identifies common and effective practices.
   The results show that several state DOTs have implemented public
   involvement programs and other procedures to assess the burdens of
   transportation investment. However, fewer agencies assess the equity of
   benefits, fewer assess outcomes of EJ actions, and fewer still link EJ
   analysis outcomes with future funding and policy decisions. On the basis
   of existing practices and regulatory guidelines, the researchers
   formulated a performance-based, maturity-scale model that agencies can
   use to benchmark the effectiveness of their external and internal EJ
   activities in achieving EJ outcomes in transportation. The model was
   applied anonymously to selected agencies to demonstrate different
   maturity levels in addressing EJ.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability is a critical concern in disseminating safety messages in
   vehicular ad-hoc-networks (VANETs). Thus far, redundant broadcast (or
   next relay broadcast) has been used to ensure reliable transfer of
   safety messages. However, redundant broadcast fails to meet
   high-reliability requirement owing to lack of a feedback or
   acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism. In this work, a power controlled
   negative-acknowledgment (NACK) mechanism is introduced as a feedback
   technique to ensure reliable reception of safety messages.
   Significantly, this work also attempts to cover vehicles present in
   transmission holes in the broadcast region. Vehicles in the immediate
   neighborhood detect and recover safety message for a vehicle present in
   the transmission hole by estimating propagation loss for the vehicle.
   NACK together with hole detection and recovery mechanism nearly
   guarantees safety-message delivery in VANETs. Reliability of the
   proposed technique is formulated mathematically with packet reception
   ratio (PRR) as the reliability metric. Using theoretical analysis and
   simulation evaluation in ns-3 we establish that the proposed technique
   guarantees safety-message reception by mitigating packet loss caused by
   interference from hidden nodes, and at instances where vehicles are
   located in the transmission holes.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in a range of critical domains
   (e.g., health care, military, critical infrastructure) where it is
   necessary that the nodes be reprogrammed with a new or modified code
   image without removing them from the deployment area. Various protocols
   have been developed for the dissemination of code images between sensors
   in multi-hop WSNs, where these sensor nodes may have varying levels of
   link quality. However, the code dissemination process in these protocols
   is hindered by the nodes with poor link quality. This results in an
   increased number of retransmissions and code dissemination time. Also,
   in several of the techniques, the code dissemination process is not
   secure and can be eavesdropped or disrupted by a malicious wireless
   sensor node in the transmission range. In this paper, we propose a
   simple approach, Secure and Link-Quality Cognizant Image Distribution
   (SIMAGE), to enhance the existing code dissemination protocol using the
   available resources in the sensors. Specifically, our approach adapts to
   the varying link conditions via dynamic packet sizing to reduce the
   number of retransmissions and overall code dissemination time. Our
   approach also provides confidentiality and integrity to the code
   dissemination process by utilizing energy-efficient encryption and
   authentication mechanisms with RC4 and the CBC-MAC. We have evaluated
   SIMAGE in a network of real sensors and the results show that adjusting
   the packet size as a function of link quality reduces the retransmitted
   data by 93\% and the image transmission time by 35\% when compared to
   the existing code dissemination protocols. The trade-offs between
   reliability, security overhead, and overall transmission time for SIMAGE
   are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing in a cognitive radio network is an essential technique
   that makes secondary users to detect the presence of primary users.
   Furthermore, the secondary users can make use of sensing results to help
   the primary users' transmission in a way to forward them in reward for
   allowing the spectrum access. However, for the primary users, the
   spectrum sensing can be considered eavesdropping in the sense that the
   secondary users may try to decode primary users' messages based on the
   sensing results. In this paper, by applying the notion of
   information-theoretic secrecy to the cognitive radio scenario, we
   propose a secure cooperative transmission scheme targeting at allowing
   the secondary users to sense and relay but making them ignorant of the
   primary users' message. Wiretap channel coding is applied to an encoding
   process of primary users, and the secondary users help the primary
   users' transmission in a way to forward the amplified sensing results
   combined with their own messages. We characterize an achievable secrecy
   rate and data rate pair that primary and secondary users can achieve and
   formulate three optimization problems from which the secondary
   transmitter carefully distributes transmit power between the relaying
   signal and its own message. The numerical results show that our scheme
   has a non-zero positive secrecy rate in the area where non-cooperative
   scheme achieves a zero secrecy rate.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional uni-polarized multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna
   systems offer the advantages of higher data rate and higher reliability
   through the use of spatial multiplexing and space-time coding,
   respectively. However, the cost and space constraints have led to the
   use of dual-polarized MIMO antenna systems where two spatially separated
   uni-polarized antennas are replaced by a single antenna element
   employing orthogonal polarizations, thereby exploiting polarization
   diversity. The advantages of dual polarized antennas can be further
   exploited by the use of precoding at the transmitter which leads to
   reduced complexity at the receiver for downlink communications, when
   compared to the conventional multi-user detectors. In this paper, we
   propose a singular value decomposition based precoding-aided
   dual-polarized MIMO system and compare its performance with the
   conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) based approach for
   mitigating co-channel interference in a multi-cell environment
   consisting of flat Rayleigh fading channels. Our performance results
   reveal that the precoding-aided dual-polarized MIMO system outperforms
   the conventional MMSE detection scheme and offers appreciable gain in
   symbol energy-to-noise ratio performance.}},

Abstract = {{Femtocells have emerged as an alternative solution for operators to

   OPNET, a high fidelity simulation environment for wireless networks, a
   femtocell modeling and development platform is created, closely
   following the specifications dictated by 3GPP regarding the entities,
   functionalities, procedures, and message formats for femtocell networks.
   It is shown how the platform reflects the effect of both interference
   and backhaul degradation on the overall performance of the network,
   which represent the key concerns for operators nowadays regarding

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) provide vehicle-to-vehicle and
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communication using Dedicated Short-Range
   Communications (DSRC). The core objective of VANETs is to provide safety
   message communication among vehicles. In dense urban traffic, safety
   message communication encounters severe packet collisions due to
   excessive number of nodes contending to access the control channel. In
   such a complex dense and mobile scenario, an ideal single vehicle per
   time slot has yet not been achieved. This paper introduces the use of
   lane level location information to achieve a single vehicle per time
   slot configuration. The transmission range of a message originator is
   divided into a grid using distance and lanes as the two variables. Each
   block within the grid houses a single vehicle at most that is assigned a
   unique time slot. The contention among nodes for the same time slot is
   virtually removed. Theory and ns-3 simulation justify the feasibility,
   and prove that the technique reduces packet collisions by 2\%, and
   improves message dissemination speed by as much as 30\% each hop.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation system for modern multicore architectures is composed of
   various component models. For such a system to be useful for research
   purposes, modifiability is a key quality attribute. Users, when building
   a simulation model, need to have the capability to adjust various
   aspects of a component, or even replace a component with another of the
   same type. Software design considerations can determine whether or not a
   simulation system is successful in providing such capabilities. This
   paper presents a few design tactics that we adopt in creating
   configurable, modifiable, and reusable components for Manifold, our
   parallel simulation framework for multicore systems. The main example
   component is MCP-cache, a coherence cache model. The ideas behind the
   tactics are general enough and should be useful to designers of similar

Abstract = {{Wave propagation in a periodic structure, formed by membrane elements on
   nonlinear elastic supports, is studied using a finite element
   discretization of a single unit cell followed by a perturbation
   analysis. The study is motivated in part by the need to study the
   dynamic behavior of micro-machined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs). The
   requisite small parameter in the system arises from the ratio of the
   membrane to flexible support stiffness. The perturbation approach
   recovers linear Bloch formalism at first order, and amplitude-dependent
   dispersion corrections at higher orders. The procedure is used to
   generate weakly nonlinear band diagrams, which can in turn be used to
   identify amplitude-dependent bandgaps and group velocities. These
   diagrams also reveal that the strongest amplitude dependency occurs in
   high-frequency optical modes. Ultimately, the predicted dispersion
   behavior will be useful in assessing inter-element coupling and
   identifying effective excitation strategies for actuating CMUTs.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical response of a SDOF oscillator with a friction element and
   spring in series is investigated. The connection between the friction
   element and the spring is massless resulting in an ideal ``Iwan
   element,{''} also termed an elastic/perfectly-plastic element. A
   methodology is proposed that avoids the complications caused by
   hysteresis, allowing the system to be simulated using relatively simple
   programming logic. A notable feature of the technique is that it yields
   a functional relation for the friction force that depends on the present
   value of the state vector, rather than on prior history of the motion.
   The method introduces a small, ``fictitious{''} slider mass within the
   Iwan element. Simulations are presented to show how the relative size of
   the slider mass affects the tradeoff between accuracy and computational
   costs. It is seen that the results of the method are very accurate and
   easy to implement. It is also shown that the added numerical stiffness
   associated with the high-frequency dynamics of the slider mass can be
   alleviated through use of a switchable viscous damping term. The viscous
   damping term decreases the number of timesteps required for simulation
   without adversely affecting the accuracy. The paper considers SDOF
   systems having a single Iwan-element as well as multiple Iwan elements.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need to include the availability of water sources as
   a design criterion because future forecasts suggest that water demands
   will increase significantly while freshwater resources are being
   depleted. In this paper, we focus on the amounts of water that are
   consumed in automotive vehicle manufacturing and life-cycle processes.
   Although water use is typically metered at the factory level, water
   consumption (i.e., water lost through evaporation and/or incorporation
   into a material, part, and/or product) is much harder to quantify. In
   this paper, we will discuss the amount of water consumed directly in
   vehicle manufacturing and the vehicle life cycle processes. This
   ``direct{''} water consumption can be directly traced to the vehicle
   manufacturing analogously to direct labor. It will also be shown that
   indirect processes, specifically, electricity production and consumption
   also counts for a significant amount of water consumption. Reduction of
   electricity consumption, in particular from thermo-electric power
   plants, can lead to substantial water consumption reductions, and thus
   win-win situations. The impact of water consumption varies by region and
   locality, and the impact of water saving technologies in production may
   be negated by increased use of electricity in water scarce regions.}},

Abstract = {{Projection moire technique using laser interferometry to generate
   grating patterns is one of the major techniques for out-of-plane
   displacement or warpage measurement of electronic packaging devices.
   Laser speckle is one of the most crucial sources of noise that increase
   measurement error and decrease repeatability of projection moire
   systems. The aim of this work is to reduce the laser speckle noise by
   optimizing the noise control parameters (laser power, camera exposure
   and camera gain) to minimize the measurement error and maximize the
   repeatability of the projection moire system. Taguchi's design
   experimental method is used to formulate the experimental layout, to
   investigate the effect of the each control parameter on the measurement
   error and repeatability, and to determine the best possible parameter
   levels. Regression analysis is employed to precisely find the optimum
   values of the each control parameter. The validation test shows that the
   approach using Taguchi method and regression analysis is well
   established to optimize the noise control parameters of the projection
   moire system.}},

Abstract = {{Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are a major cause of morbidity and
   mortality in the US. It is classically thought of as a disease of older
   men with the incidence approaching 30\%. The most common place of AAA is
   infrarenal abdominal aorta where oscillatory shear stress (OSS) is
   present. OSS is known to initiate an inflammatory response in the
   endothelium. It is also known that females are at lower risk for
   developing AAA. The explanation for this difference is lacking. We
   recruited 8 healthy volunteers, 4 males and 4 females who underwent
   infrarenal abdominal aortic Magnetic Resonance angiography and phase
   contrast imaging. The collected data was used to calculate systolic
   forward and diastolic retrograde blood flow. Our results suggest that
   female infrarenal aortas are exposed to a 3-fold lower degree of OSS. It
   appears that the low resistance internal iliac arterial system may be in
   part responsible for such flow patterns. We conclude that female aortas
   are subjected to lower OSS and that low resistance internal iliac
   arterial system appears to play a protective role.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical investigation simulating feasibility of magnetic drug
   targeting (MDT) at an atherosclerotic lesion of the left coronary artery
   of a patient using iron nano-particles coated with a therapeutic agent
   is reported. Progression of a plaque in the left coronary artery over a
   six month period was previously determined by intravascular ultrasound
   (IVUS). The site where the progression is active is located on the
   leeward side of the plaque. The proximal segment of the left coronary
   artery including the lesion was reconstructed by our 3D IVUS technique,
   and a Doppler measurement provided velocity waveforms in the lumen.
   These data are used to simulate blood flow employing computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD). Wall shear stress (WSS) and flow pathlines show that few
   nanoparticles would reach the active lesion region of the plaque.
   Therefore, MDT is considered as a possible effective therapy. Numerical
   investigations are performed to examine the feasibility for treatment by
   modeling hypothetical magnet fields, iron nano-particles, and coronary
   artery flow conditions. The magnetic field in the lesion segment
   produced by a permanent magnet located outside the lumen is calculated.
   The motion of the nanoparticles in the segment is a combined result of
   the velocities produced by hemodynamic and magnetic forces. Various
   particles and magnets are investigated in the simulations. Two kinds of
   results are presented: the distribution of the magnetic force produced
   by the magnets, and the quantity of captured particles at the lesion
   during various time intervals (number of heart beats).}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests that physical microenvironments and mechanical
   stresses direct cell fate in developing tissues. However, how these
   physical properties affect morphogenesis remains unknown. We show here
   that ECM mechanical properties, i.e. stiffness, reproduced by using
   hydrogel, guide tissue morphogenesis in the developing lung bud. In
   particular, decreasing substrate stiffness in cultured lung buds
   resulted in an inhibition of appropriate cleft formation and a resulting
   enlargement of epithelial buds. These findings suggest that the
   magnitude of mechanical stiffness across the lung bud alters the
   branching pattern. Additionally, physically designed hydrogel material
   is a valuable tool for producing the specific microenvironment to
   explore how physical cues affect and alter tissue morphogenesis for in
   vitro study.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-based surgical planning of cardiothoracic surgery is a new
   paradigm that uses engineering tools to model and evaluate
   patient-specific surgical options and thus provide insights on the
   hemodynamic implications of a given design. In this study, the total
   cavopulmonary palliation of single ventricle defects serves as a
   test-bed for such techniques by comparing the output of pre-operative
   modeling to hemodynamic outcomes derived from post-operative imaging.
   The resulting accuracy of the models demonstrates that, despite the
   inherent challenges, surgical planning is a viable reality in single
   ventricle cardiothoracic surgery that can potentially deliver
   significant clinical impact.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion absorption refrigeration (DAR) cycle can provide
   refrigeration in remote locations using waste-heat or other
   low-grade-thermal input. Unlike conventional absorption systems, the DAR
   cycle receives no mechanical input, so all flows must be driven by
   passive mechanisms. Further, a third inert gas is employed to allow
   refrigerant expansion since conventional throttling devices impart large
   pressure drops. Thus, DAR. absorber design is challenging due to
   increased mass transfer resistance from the inert gas, multiple outlet
   flow paths for the inert gas and solution, and limited (passive)
   external cooling. In the present study, a detailed, coupled heat and
   mass transfer model is developed for a counter-flow serpentine-tube DAR
   absorber. The model is applied to the analysis of an absorber for a
   small-scale refrigeration system with a 36 W cooling capacity. Studies
   are conducted to investigate the effect of key configuration and
   operational parameters on absorber performance, and guidelines are
   provided for component and system design.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal transport at the carbon nanotube (CNT) interfaces such as
   CNT-oxide and CNT-CNT junctions can significantly impact the device
   performance and reliability of nanotube network based thin-film
   transistors. For an example, the high electrical and thermal resistance
   at CNT junctions can cause hot spots, inefficient heat removal or even
   breakdown of CNTs. This paper presents a molecular dynamics based
   computational study of the heat dissipation at CNT-CNT junctions
   supported on silicon dioxide substrate. The breakdown of CNTs at high
   power densities and heat dissipation mechanism at CNT-CNT-oxide
   junctions is analyzed for different contact structures. It has been
   observed that at similar power densities the temperature in hanging CNTs
   can be hundreds of degree higher and can reach to breakdown temperature
   compared to the CNTs well-contacted with the substrate. The energy
   transfer in different frequency bands across the CNT-CNT-oxide contact
   was investigated using spectral energy density method. The lower CNT in
   the supported CNT-CNT junctions blocks the direct transport of high
   frequency phonons of top CNT to the oxide substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems possess the capability for
   highly-efficient power production at a low level of emissions. However,
   these fragile, high-temperature cells are prone to thermal failure,
   which shortens their life-span and hinders their marketability. Thermal
   radiation has proven itself effective at mitigating temperature
   gradients, and preventing thermal failure, in tubular SOFC stacks.
   However, the conventional planar SOFC design does not allow for
   sufficient radiation exchange inside the gas channels to have a
   significant impact on temperature gradients. For the purpose of
   investigating unconventional planar SOFC designs that would optimize
   radiation exchange, a 1-D radiation model was developed. This model
   focuses on the radiation exchange within the flow channels of an SOFC,
   and resolves a radiation profile based on the current temperature
   profile of the cell. This radiation model was integrated into a 1-D,
   planar SOFC MatlabSimulink (TM) model developed for the HyPer fuel
   cell/gas turbine facility at NETL in Morgantown, WV. This paper
   describes the development of this radiation model, and verifies the
   model outputs against those of another SOFC radiation model. The model
   presented is designed to characterize SOFC operation over a broad range
   of geometric settings and operating parameters in order to determine the
   optimal conditions for radiation exchange. The capability of this model
   to characterize SOFC operation, for conventional and unconventional
   geometric designs, is presented and analyzed.}},

   effect of crystallographic texture and the tension-compression asymmetry
   on the bending response of superelastic beams is studied. The results of
   texture measurements are used to assign appropriate crystal orientations
   to the grains in the model. By considering various combinations of
   crystal orientations, the effect of preferred crystallographic texture
   on the bending response is studied. The size effect is also studied by

Abstract = {{We used three dimensional computer simulations to examine heat transport
   in a microchannel that encompasses a periodic array of biomimetic
   synthetic cilia. We modeled two. different configurations of tilted
   cilia. Both configurations consisted of a grid of evenly spaced cilia
   with length L and square cross-section 0.1L x 0.1L. The cilia were
   spaced at a distance delta x between cilium rows and the inter-cilia
   spacing in the rows was fixed at delta z = 0.25L for one configuration
   and delta z = 0.5L for the other. The channel was filled with a viscous
   fluid and its top and bottom walls were maintained at different
   temperatures. The cilia were attached to the bottom channel wall at a
   specific angle and were actuated by a periodic external force applied
   vertically to their free ends. The periodical beating of cilia induces
   fluid mixing inside the fluid that facilitates heat transport. To model
   this multi-component system, we employed a thermal lattice Boltzmann
   model coupled with the lattice spring model. In order to investigate how
   the active cilia affect the heat transfer between the channel walls we
   varied three parameters in the system. Specifically, we systematically
   changed the tilt of the cilia, the spacing between cilia and the
   oscillation frequency of the cilia. Our investigations have allowed us
   to determine the optimal conditions for using cilia to increase the heat
   flux from a heated surface. Our findings could be useful for developing
   new methods for temperature control in microscale devices.}},

Abstract = {{There has been growing interest in the research fields of morphing-wing
   and flapping-wing aircraft for improved flight efficiency and
   maneuverability. Recent efforts have focused on the use of smart
   materials as actuators in biomimetic morphing and flapping. Macro-Fiber
   Composites (MFCs) are composed of piezoelectric fibers sandwiched
   between interdigitated electrodes in addition to Kapton and epoxy
   laminates. The MFC technology offers effective sensing and actuation
   with its light weight, high flexibility, durability, high performance,
   and availability in various sizes. Researchers have studied the use of
   MFCs in structural health monitoring, vibration control, actuation, and
   energy harvesting. In the last few years, MFCs have been successfully
   integrated to morphing-wing aircraft by several others. However, there
   has been limited work on MFC-based flapping wing by dynamic actuation.
   The flapping-wing flight is more beneficial than conventional flight at
   relatively small scales due to its high maneuverability. Biological
   flapping-wing flyers incorporate different wing motions such as dynamic
   bending, twisting, and folding to create asymmetry for positive lift and
   thrust resultants. This paper experimentally characterizes the
   electroelastic dynamics. and power consumption of two MFC-based
   architectures for bio-inspired flapping. The first configuration employs
   an asymmetric wide bimorph architecture with 0 degrees and 450 degrees
   piezoelectric fibers to have an actuation authority in bending and
   twisting. The second configuration uses a double bimorph arrangement
   made of two narrow bimorphs with 0 degrees fibers with a chord-wise
   spacing to create both bending and twisting depending on the relative
   actuation inputs. Both of the bending-twisting architectures considered
   herein are tested over a wide range dynamic actuation levels and
   frequencies to characterize the electroelastic response. In addition to
   measuring the power consumption levels in dynamic bending and twisting,
   flexible solar films are investigated as the light-weight
   multifunctional substructure layers that can create both lift surface
   and electricity toward the concept of self-powered flapping.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of humankind to mimic fish-like locomotion for engineering
   applications depends mainly on the availability of suitable actuators.
   Researchers have recently focused on developing robotic fish using smart
   materials, particularly Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites (IPMCs), as a
   compliant, noise-free, and scalable alternative to conventional
   motor-based propulsion systems. In this paper, we investigate fish-like
   self propulsion using flexible bimorphs made of Macro-Fiber Composite
   (MFC) piezoelectric laminates. Similar to IPMCs, MFCs also exhibit high
   efficiency in size, energy consumption, and noise reduction. In
   addition, MFCs offer large dynamic forces in bending actuation, strong
   electromechanical coupling as well as both low-frequency and
   high-frequency performance capabilities. The experimental component of
   the presented work focuses on the characterization of an MFC bimorph
   propulsor for thrust generation in a quiescent fluid as well as the
   development of a preliminary robotic fish prototype incorporating a
   microcontroller and a printed-circuit-board (PCB) amplifier to generate
   high actuation voltage for battery-powered free locomotion. From the
   theoretical standpoint, a reliable modeling framework that couples the
   actuator dynamics, hydroelasticity, and fish locomotion theory is
   essential to both design and control of robotic fish. Therefore, a
   distributed-parameter electroelastic model with fluid effects and
   actuator dynamics is coupled with the elongated body theory. Both in-air
   and underwater experiments are performed to verify the incorporation of
   hydrodynamic effects in the linear actuation regime. For
   electroelastically nonlinear actuation levels, experimentally obtained
   underwater vibration response is coupled with the elongated body theory
   to predict the thrust output. Experiments are conducted to validate the
   electrohydroelastic modeling approach employed in this work and to
   characterize the performance of an MFC bimorph propulsor. Finally, a
   battery-powered preliminary robotic fish prototype is developed and
   tested in free locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art hydraulic hose and piping systems employ integral
   sensor nodes for structural health monitoring in order to avoid
   catastrophic failures. These systems lend themselves to energy
   harvesting for powering sensor nodes. The foremost reason is that the
   power intensity of hydraulic systems is orders of magnitude higher than
   typical energy harvesting sources considered to date, such as wind
   turbulence, water flow, or vibrations of civil structures. Hydraulic
   systems inherently have a high energy intensity associated with the mean
   pressure and flow. Accompanying the mean pressure is what is termed
   dynamic pressure ripple caused by the action of pumps and actuators.
   Pressure ripple is conducive to energy harvesting as it is a
   deterministic source with an almost periodic time domain behavior.
   Pressure ripple generally increases in magnitude with the mean pressure
   of the system, which in turn increases the power that can be harvested.
   The harvested energy in hydraulic systems could enable self-powered
   wireless sensor nodes for applications such as energy-autonomous
   structural health monitoring and prognosis. An energy harvester
   prototype was designed for generating low-power electricity from dynamic
   pressure ripples. The prototype employed an axially-poled off-the-shelf
   piezoelectric stack. A housing isolated the stack from the hydraulic
   fluid while maintaining mechanical coupling to the system to allow for
   dynamic pressure induced deflection of the stack. The system exhibits an
   attractive off-resonance energy harvesting problem since the fundamental
   resonance of the piezoelectric stack is much higher than the frequency
   content of ripple. Although the energy harvester is not excited at
   resonance, the high energy intensity of the ripple results in
   significant electrical power output. The prototype provided a maximum
   output of 1.2 mW at 120 Omega With these results, it is clear that the
   energy harvester provides non-negligible power output suitable for
   powering sensors and other low power components. This work also presents
   electromechanical model simulations for predicting the piezoelectric
   power output in terms of the force transmitted from the pressure ripple
   as well as experimental characterization of the power output as a
   function of the force from the ripple.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting from ambient environment has received increasing
   attention over the last decade due to the need for minimizing the
   dependence on conventional batteries in wireless applications. Among the
   methods of vibration-to-electricity conversion, piezoelectric
   transduction has been investigated by numerous research groups due to
   the ease of application and high power density offered by piezoelectric
   materials. Electromechanical modeling efforts of piezoelectric energy
   harvesters have been mostly focused on deterministic forms of excitation
   input, as in the typical case of harmonic excitation. In most practical
   applications, however, ambient vibrational energy is often stochastic
   with broad frequency content. This paper presents analytical and
   numerical modeling, simulations, and experimental validations of
   piezoelectric energy harvesting from broadband random vibrations. The
   models employed herein are based on distributed-parameter electroelastic
   solution to ensure that the effects of higher vibration modes are
   included. The goal is to predict the expected value of the power output
   in terms of the given power spectral density (PSD) or time history of
   the random vibration input. The analytical estimations are based on the
   PSD of broadband random base excitation and distributed-parameter
   frequency response functions (FRFs) of the coupled voltage and vibration
   response. The numerical simulations use the Fourier series
   representation of base acceleration history in an ordinary differential
   equation solver that employs first-order electroelastic equations. The
   simulations are compared against the experiments for a brass-reinforced
   PZT-5H bimorph under different random excitation levels. The analytical
   and numerical simulations exhibit very good agreement with the
   experimental measurements. Soft and hard ceramic and single crystal
   bimorphs (made of PZT-5H, PZT-8, PMN-PZT, and PMN-PZT-Mn) are compared
   for broadband random excitation through a theoretical case study.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement of structure-borne wave energy harvesting is investigated by
   exploiting metamaterial-based and metamaterial-inspired electroelastic
   systems. The concepts of wave focusing, funneling, and localization are
   leveraged to establish novel Metamaterial Energy Harvester (MEH)
   configurations. The MEH system transforms the incoming structure-borne
   wave energy into electrical energy by coupling the metamaterial and
   electroelastic domains. The energy harvesting component of the work
   employs piezoelectric transduction due to the high power density and
   ease of application offered by piezoelectric materials. Therefore, in
   all MEH configurations studied in this work, the metamaterial system is
   combined with piezoelectric energy harvesting for enhanced electricity
   generation from waves propagating in elastic structures. Experiments are
   conducted to validate the dramatic performance enhancement in MEH
   systems as compared to using the same volume of piezoelectric patch in
   the absence of the metamaterial component. It is shown that MEH systems
   can be used for both broadband and tuned wave energy harvesting.
   Examples include (1) wave guiding using an acoustic funnel, (2) wave
   focusing using a metamaterial-inspired elliptical acoustic mirror (both
   for broadband energy harvesting), and (3) energy localization using an
   imperfection in a 2-D lattice structure (for tuned energy harvesting).}},

Abstract = {{Emotional design has attracted much attention due to its important role
   in the development of products and services towards high value-added
   user satisfaction and performance enhancement. However, how to predict
   users' affective states in real time and without having to interrupt the
   user is critical to emotional design. This study compared affect
   prediction between using physiological measures and using self-report
   subjective measures. Specifically, an experiment was designed to elicit
   seven different affective states using standardized affective pictures
   as visual stimuli. Each stimulus was presented for 6 seconds and
   multiple physiological signals were measured, including facial
   electromyography, respiration rate, electroencephalography, and skin
   conductance response. Subjective ratings were also recorded immediately
   after stimulus presentation. Three data mining methods (i.e., decision
   rules, k-NN, and decomposition tree) based on the rough set theory were
   applied to construct prediction models from physiological measures and
   subjective measures, respectively. We obtained the highest mean
   prediction rate at 73.69\% for physiological models and 52.43\% for
   subjective models, respectively, across the 7 affective states. It
   demonstrates that physiological data are able to predict better result
   than subjective self-report data did and that physiological computing
   offers great potential for the development of emotional design.}},

Abstract = {{Data interoperability between computer-aided design (CAD) systems
   remains a major obstacle in the information integration and exchange in
   a collaborative engineering environment. The standards for CAD data
   exchange have remained largely restricted to geometric representations,
   causing the design intent portrayed through construction history,
   features, parameters, and constraints to be discarded in the exchange
   process. In this research paper, an ontology-based framework is proposed
   to allow for the full exchange of semantic feature data. The Ontology
   Web Language (OWL) is used to represent feature types as well as the
   concepts and properties that define features, which allows the use of
   existing ontology reasoning tools to infer new relationships and
   information between heterogeneous data. Boundary representation (B-Rep)
   data corresponding to the output of the feature operation is also stored
   for purposes of feature identification and translation verification. The
   base ontology and a small feature library are built in OWL, and a
   combination of OWL and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules are
   developed to allow a feature from an arbitrary source system to be
   automatically classified and translated into the target system through
   the use of a reasoner. These rules relate input parameter and reference
   types to expected B-Rep objects, allowing classification even when
   feature definitions vary or when little is known about the source
   system. In cases when the source system is well known, this approach
   also permits direct translation rules to be implemented. With such a
   flexible framework, a neutral feature exchange format could be
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{Developing complex engineering systems requires the consolidation of
   models from a variety of domains such as economics, mechanics and
   software engineering. These models are typically created using differing
   formalisms and by stakeholders that have varying views on the same
   problem statement. The challenging question is: what is needed to make
   sure that all of these different models remain consistent during the
   design process? A review of the related literature reveals that this is
   still an open challenge and has not yet been investigated at a
   fundamental level within the context of Model-Based Systems Engineering
   (MBSE). Therefore, this paper specifically focuses on examining the
   fundamentals of consistency management. We show that some
   inconsistencies cannot be detected and come to the conclusion that it is
   impossible to say whether or not a system is fully consistent. In this
   paper, we first introduce a mathematical foundation to define
   consistency in a formal manner. A decision-based approach to design is
   then studied and applied to the development of a real-world example. The
   research reveals several distinct types of inconsistencies that can
   occur during the design and development of a system. We show that these
   inconsistencies can be further classified into two groups: internal and
   external consistency. From these insights, the ontology of
   inconsistencies is constructed. Finally, requirements for possible tool
   support and methods to identify and manage specific types of consistency
   issues are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Modern systems are difficult to design because they often involve the
   integration of multiple engineering domains, are constrained by
   competing objectives, include a multitude of stakeholders, and are
   inundated by large quantities of design information. As the complexity
   of systems design has grown, designers are using a diverse set of
   analyses during the design process. In this paper, we present an
   approach to help designers manage this spectrum of analyses and relate
   them to their systems design problems by integrating the Object
   Management Group's Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML((TM))) with a
   process integration and design optimization (PIDO) framework. This
   allows designers to model their design problems and the related analyses
   within SysML. These related analyses can then be translated into the
   PIDO framework where they are executed and managed. The framework used
   in this paper is Phoenix Integration's Model Center. Previous approaches
   have integrated SysML with a specific analysis tool, but these
   approaches are not sufficient because they allow designers to use only a
   few types of analyses. By integrating SysML with Model Center, this
   approach allows designers to tackle the design problems from several
   perspectives. Model Center provides existing integrations to a large
   number of analysis tools allowing users to handle multiple heterogeneous
   analyses in the same environment. The implementation of this approach
   and its usefulness during a design process is illustrated using the
   design of a horizontal acting hydraulic log splitter. The log splitter
   model is chosen as the example because it is a simple hydraulic system
   with well-defined composition and modular components and has several
   competing requirements to satisfy.}},

Abstract = {{Phononic crystals are typically considered to operate in regimes where a
   linear constitutive relationship provides an adequate representation.
   For high intensity wave propagation, however, weak nonlinearities can
   affect performance. For example, a cubic nonlinearity gives rise to
   frequency shifting and thus a shift in band gap location. In the study
   of nonlinear optics, a cubic term has been treated using a quasi-linear
   constitutive relationship with intensity dependent properties. This
   technique is explored herein for generating nonlinear dispersion
   relationships for the elastic case. In addition, a perturbation method
   developed previously for discrete systems, used in conjunction with a
   finite element discretization, is proposed as an alternative dispersion
   analysis tool. Simulations of the fully nonlinear governing equations
   are provided as validation of the predicted dispersion curves.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3D) technologies with stacked chips have the
   potential to provide new chip architecture, improved device density,
   performance, efficiency, and bandwidth. Their increased power density
   also can become a daunting challenge for heat removal. Furthermore,
   power density can be highly non-uniform leading to time and space
   varying hotspots which can severely affect performance and reliability
   of the integrated circuits. Thus, it is important to mitigate thermal
   gradients on chip while considering the associated cooling costs. One
   method of thermal management currently under investigation is the use of
   superlattice thermoelectric coolers (TECs) which can be employed for on
   demand and localized cooling. In this paper, a detailed 3D thermal model
   of a stacked electronic package with two dies and four ultrathin
   integrated TECs is studied in order to investigate the efficacy of TECs
   in hot spot cooling for a 3D technology. We observe up to 14.6 degrees C
   of cooling at a hot spot inside the package by TECs. A strong vertical
   coupling has been observed between the TECs located in top and bottom
   dies. Bottom TECs can detrimentally heat the top hotspots in both steady
   state and transient operation. TECs need to be carefully placed inside
   the package to avoid such undesired heating. Thermal contact resistances
   between dies, inside the TEC module, and between the TEC and heat
   spreader are shown to have a crucial effect on TEC performance inside
   the package. We observed that square root current pulse can provide very
   efficient short-duration transient cooling at hotspots.}},

Abstract = {{Through-silicon via (TSV), being one of the key enabling technologies
   for three dimensional (3D) Integrated Circuit (IC) stacking, silicon
   interposer technology, and advanced wafer level packaging (WLP), has
   attracted tremendous interest throughout the semiconductor industry.
   However, limited work addresses TSV reliability issue, and most of the
   existing reliability studies focus on the thermo-mechanical performance
   of TSVs in a free-standing wafer, rather than in an integrated package.
   In this paper, three-dimensional thermomechanical Finite-Element (FE)
   models with TSVs in both free-standing wafers and 3D integrated packages
   have been built and analyzed. In addition, Design of Experiments (DOE)
   based approach has been used to understand the effect of various
   parameters. Results show that the selection of underfill materials
   between stacked dies is the most dominating design factor for
   TSV/microbump reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Laser generation/EMAT (electromagnetic acoustic transducer) reception
   ultrasonic inspection technique shows a great promise in the field of
   Non-Destructive Testing of welds due to its non-contact nature. However,
   the broadband nature of laser generation and the dispersive
   characteristic of Lamb waves make the laser generated ultrasonic signals
   in thin structures extremely complicated. In order to ease the
   interpretation of received signals, it is desirable to investigate the
   interactions of different structural features with Lamb waves and find
   their related signatures in signal, which offers the potential to detect
   different types of weld defects using a single test procedure. This work
   proposed a technique based on 2-D Fourier Transformation to investigate
   the laser generated Lamb waves experimentally and to find the most
   sensitive predictors in EMAT received signals corresponding to a
   specific structural feature of interest. The amplitudes of different
   Lamb wave modes in the wave-number/frequency domain provide a wealth of
   information. The demonstration of the technique was carried out on
   aluminum plates with isolated rectangular notches of different depths.
   The procedure introduced here is general which can be employed in other
   applications of Non-Destructive Testing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we experimentally investigate the effect of supply air
   temperature on rack cooling in a high density raised floor data center
   facility. A series of experiments are performed on a 42 U (1-U = 4.45
   cm) rack populated with 1-U servers. Desired rack heat loads are
   achieved by managing the distribution of server compute load within the
   rack. During the present experiments, temperatures at various locations
   in the hot and cold aisle corresponding to the rack air inlet and outlet
   are recorded. The temperatures are measured using a grid consisting of
   256 thermocouples. The temperature measurements are further complimented
   with the flow field at the rack inlet. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
   technique is used to capture the flow field at the rack inlet. The
   temperature maps in concert with the PIV flow field help in quantifying
   the rack cooling effectiveness. The temperature and flow measurements
   are measured for various cases by altering the supply air temperatures
   and perforated tile flow rates. The results are analyzed and compared
   with the ASHRARE recommended guidelines to arrive at the optimum supply
   air temperature. A perceptible change in the temperature and flow
   distribution is observed for the six cases investigated.}},

   developed in this paper are suitable for cases when the time scale of
   switching is in the order of the task execution time, that is, on the
   time scale found commonly with sporadically missed deadlines. This paper
   extends the prior work by developing frequency-weighted anytime
   controllers. The selection of the weighting function is driven by the
   expectation of the situations that would require anytime operation. For
   example, if the anytime operation is due to occasional and isolated
   missed deadlines, then the weighting on high frequencies should be
   larger than that for low frequencies. Low frequency components will have
   a smaller change over one sample time, so failing to update these
   components for one sample period will have less effect than with the
   high frequency components. An example will be included that applies the
   anytime control strategy to a model of a DC motor with deadzone and
   saturation nonlinearities.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, lattice reduction (LR) technique has caught great attention
   for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) receiver because of its low
   complexity and high performance. However, when the number of antennas is
   large, LR-aided linear detectors and successive interference
   cancellation (SIC) detectors still exhibit considerable performance gap
   to the optimal maximum likelihood detector (MLD). To enhance the
   performance of the LR-aided detectors, the LR-aided K-best algorithm was
   developed at the cost of the extra complexity on the order O(N-t(2) K +
   NtK2), where N-t is the number of transmit antennas and K is the number
   of candidates. In this paper, we develop an LR-aided K-best algorithm
   with lower complexity by exploiting a priority queue. With the aid of
   the priority queue, our analysis shows that the complexity of the
   LR-aided K-best algorithm can be further reduced to O(N-t(2) K + NtK2)).
   The low complexity of the proposed LR-aided K-best algorithm allows us
   to perform the algorithm for large MIMO systems (e.g., 50x50 MIMO
   systems) with large candidate sizes. Simulations show that as the number
   of antennas increases, the error performance approaches that of AWGN
   channel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on modeling of the scanning laser epitaxy (SLE)
   process that is currently being investigated and developed at the
   Georgia Institute of Technology. SLE is a laser-based manufacturing
   process for the creation of equiaxed, directionally solidified and
   single-crystal deposits of nickel superalloys onto superalloy substrates
   through melting and resolidif cation of alloy powders using a scanning
   laser beam. The thermal modeling of the system, done in a commercial CFD
   software package, simulates a heat source moving over a powder bed and
   dynamically adjusts the property values for consolidating CMSX-4 nickel
   superalloy powder. The associated melting and re-solidification process
   is modeled using an immediate consolidation approach, and the predicted
   melt depth is compared with the experimental data obtained. For a given
   position of the beam, geometrical parameters of the melt pool are used
   to estimate the resulting microstructure. The influence of the

Abstract = {{The motivating question for this article is: `How should a system level
   designer allocate resources for auxiliary simulation model refinement
   while satisfying system level design objectives and ensuring robust
   process requirements in multiscale systems? Our approach consists of
   integrating: (i) a robust design method for multiscale systems (ii) an
   information economics based approach for quantifying the cost-benefit
   trade-off for mitigating uncertainty in simulation models. Specifically,
   the focus is on allocating resources for reducing model parameter
   uncertainty arising due to insufficient data from simulation models. A
   comprehensive multiscale design problem, the concurrent design of
   material and product is used for validation. The multiscale system is
   simulated with models at multiple length and time scales. The accuracy
   of the simulated performance is determined by the trade-off between
   computational cost for model refinement and the benefits of mitigated
   uncertainty from the refined models. System level designers can
   efficiently allocate resources for sequential simulation model
   refinement in multiscale systems using this approach.}},

Abstract = {{In product family design the goal is to generate a set of lowest cost
   products that target specific market niches. Sharing components, called
   platforms, between different products can minimize duplication of
   effort, thereby lowering family costs. However, if the products'
   requirements are too dissimilar, sharing components may compromise the
   end product; such variance will lead to lower end products being
   overdesigned and/or higher end products being underdesigned. It is
   important to identify which components are similar enough, so that
   sharing does not compromise the individual products' performances.
   Most existing product family design methods make decisions a priori
   about platforms; constraining platforms to be used by every product in
   the family, or not at all. Methods that simultaneously optimize
   component sharing and design variable settings have the potential to
   find better families because product subsets may be more similar to each
   other than to other subsets of products. Allowing components to be
   shared between any subset of family members leads to a very large
   combinatorial problem, and considering large product families can be
   computationally prohibitive.
   This paper proposes a method to identify possible sets of product family
   platforms by using the pattern recognition technique of fuzzy c-means
   clustering on component subspaces. Component subspaces are taken from a
   database of generated design points for the whole family. If components
   from different products are similar enough to be grouped into the same
   cluster, then those components could possibly become the same platform.
   Fuzzy equivalence relations can be extracted from the cluster membership
   functions that show the binary relationship from one products' component
   to a different products' component. Ultimately, this method can be used
   as a platform identification heuristic in a larger product family design
   methodology. This method is demonstrated by applying it to find possible
   common components in a family of universal electric motors.}},

Abstract = {{To simulate the dynamic behaviors of large molecular systems, approaches
   that solve ordinary differential equations such as molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulation may become inefficient. The kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
   method as the alternative has been widely used in simulating rare events
   such as chemical reactions or phase transitions. Yet lack of complete
   knowledge of transitions and the associated rates is one major challenge
   for accurate KMC predictions. In this paper, a reliable KMC (R-KMC)
   mechanism is proposed to improve the robustness of KMC results, where
   propensities are interval estimates instead of precise numbers and
   sampling is based on random sets instead of random numbers. A
   multi-event algorithm is developed and implemented. The weak convergence
   of the multi-event algorithm towards traditional KMC is demonstrated
   with a proposed generalized Chapman Kolmogorov Equation.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer matrix method is an expedient numerical technique for
   determining the dynamic behavior of a rotordynamic system (e.g., whirl
   frequencies, steady-state response to forcing). The typical 8 x 8
   transfer matrix suffers from several deficiencies. First, for a system
   incorporating damping, the method generates a characteristic polynomial
   of degree 8N for a model of N lumped masses (degree 4N for an undamped
   model). The high degree of the polynomial results in lengthy computation
   times and decreased accuracy. Second, as discussed herein, the 8 x 8
   formulation fails to distinguish between forward and backward whirl.
   These deficiencies are overcome by a novel complex-valued state variable
   redefinition resulting in a 4x4 transfer matrix including external
   support stiffness and damping. The complex transfer matrix is then
   modified to account for analysis within a rotating reference frame.
   Analysis in a rotating reference frame is a judicious means to determine
   unique system fault characteristics, which serve as a starting point for
   the development of an on-line fault detection system. Insights into
   using the complex transfer matrix in a rotating reference frame are
   discussed. Analytical results in both inertial and rotating reference
   frames for an overhung rotor model are provided.}},

   holing of laminated stacks of electrical steels. Three different holing
   methods were considered: plunge milling, helical milling (orbit
   milling), and drilling. Stack delamination, axial thrust force, and burr
   formation were measured at various feed rates for each process and
   utilized as comparison metrics. Results from the initial experimental
   investigation indicate that drilling produces significant burr and
   plunge milling, whilst reducing burr formation compared to drilling, led
   to delamination of the stack. Helical milling minimized thrust forces,
   avoided delamination and minimized burr formation. An interesting spring
   back effect was also observed during the cutting of the laminated
   stacks. It is concluded that helical milling is a viable and effective
   processing method for making holes in laminated stack of hard electrical
   steels.}},

Abstract = {{Melt-mixing processes such as extrusion-injection molding induce shear
   mechanical forces to enhance the melt blend of nanofiller-polymer and
   have been considered as time and cost efficient in commercial processing
   of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Extensive research has been conducted
   so far to investigate the overall performance of melt-processed PNCs.
   However there is lack of systematic studies on the nanomaterial induced
   phenomena that dominate the properties of the end-use melt mixing
   processed parts leading to engineered high quality PNCs. Furthermore,
   studies for exploration of the structure-property relationships in the
   melt processed PNCs are also limited. In this work, nanocomposites of
   Polyamide-12 (PA12) reinforced with exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets
   (xGnP (TM)) up to 15wt\% were fabricated using two different compounding
   techniques: coating followed by melt mixing and direct melt mixing.
   Effects of the compounding methods on the reinforcing efficiency of xGnP
   within the PA12 matrix were investigated. To understand the reinforcing
   mechanisms contributing to alteration of the mechanical properties,
   rheological behavior of the PNCs were investigated in the linear
   viscoelastic region and correlated with the state of nanofiller-matrix
   interfacial interaction and the nanofiller dispersion. The results
   suggest that xGnP coating of the PA12 powder resulted in improved
   flexural strength of the PNCs with respect to that of the pure PA12 and
   of PNCs made by direct melt mixing. The rheological low-frequency
   measurements demonstrate that addition of xGnP resulted in a larger.
   increase in the melt dynamic viscosity of the coated-melt mixed PNCs
   than the direct melt-mixed ones. This suggest stronger xGnP-PA12
   interfacial interaction and better dispersion state of the nanofiller in
   the coated-melt mixed PNCs than the latter PNCs. Addition of xGnP
   content resulted in improved storage modulus for PNCs made by either
   compounding method. However, the results support the evidence of
   post-processing induced re-agglomeration or suppressed dispersing
   efficiency of the coating process at extreme xGnP content as was
   elucidated through the shear thinning behavior of the melt and the
   flexural modulus of the highly reinforced parts.}},

Abstract = {{A sensor module that integrates a thin film Polyvinylidene Fluoride
   (PVDF) piezoelectric strain sensor and an in situ data logging platform
   has been designed and implemented for monitoring of feed and transverse
   forces in the peripheral end milling process. The module, which is
   mounted on the tool shank, measures the dynamic strain(s) produced in
   the tool and logs the data into an on-board card for later retrieval.
   The close proximity between the signal source and the PVDF sensor(s)
   minimizes the attenuation and distortion of the signal along the
   transmitting path and provides high-fidelity signals. It also
   facilitates the employment of a first principles model based on
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the constitutive equations of the
   piezoelectric sensor material to relate the in situ measured PVDF sensor
   signals to the feed and transverse forces acting on the tool. The PVDF
   sensor signals are found to compare well with the force signals measured
   by a platform type piezoelectric force dynamometer in peripheral end
   milling experiments.}},

   geometrical pattern transfer and simultaneous morphological control. A
   special effort was made to generate a microgroove pattern with an open

   with different feature sizes under different processing conditions. The
   results demonstrated the feasibility and the versatility of the proposed

   the geometrical and boundary conditions during in mold annealing,
   micropatterns with graded porous structures were demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The task of minimizing the downtime of a data center is becoming
   increasingly important due to the necessity of availability and
   maintaining the integrity of the data being handled by the data center.
   Consequently, a model used to predict the thermal response of a data
   center would be useful information in designing mechanisms to minimize
   the downtime during a failure or to serve as an alternative analysis
   method other than CFD. This paper will focus on a thermodynamic approach
   of predicting the thermal response of the data center space with the use
   of lumped system analysis. The model will be developed and validated
   using actual data from a chiller failure event in the CEETHERM Data
   Center Laboratory. Events in sequence are: (i) Chiller failure, (ii)
   Data center shutdown due to critical temperatures and (iii) Chiller
   restored. To illustrate, the data center section of interest consists of
   10 racks of servers (maximum capacity of 24kW for each rack) with a
   total of 3360 nodes and is chilled using chilled water from the building
   chiller, through which the cooling resources are distributed using a
   rear door heat exchanger and a cooling room air conditioning unit
   (CRAC). The relevant and important data that was recorded in this
   failure are the : (1) Server inlet temperatures, (2) CPU temperatures,
   (3) CRAC supply and return air temperatures, (4) Chiller supply and
   return water temperature, (5) Chiller flow rate, (6) Data center space
   temperature and humidity, (7) Server power draw and (8) CRAC fan speeds.}},

Abstract = {{The description of heat transport at small length scales is very
   important in understanding a wide range of micro and nanoscale systems.
   In systems where coherent phonon transport effects are negligible, the
   Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is often employed to describe the
   distribution and propagation of thermal energy in the lattice. The
   phonon distribution function depends not only on the temporal and
   spatial coordinates, but also on polarization and wave vector, making
   fully-resolved simulations very expensive. Therefore, there is a need to
   develop accurate and efficient numerical techniques for the solution of
   the BTE. The discrete ordinates method (DOM) and more recently, the
   lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) have been used for this purpose. In this
   work, a comparison between the numerical solution of the phonon BTE by
   the LBM and DOM is made in order to delineate the strengths and
   weaknesses of these approaches. Test cases are chosen with Knudsen (Kn)
   numbers varying between 0.01-100 to cover the full range of diffusive to
   ballistic phonon transport. The results show that solutions obtained
   from both methods converge to analytical results for the 1 dimensional
   phonon transport in a slab. Solutions obtained by two methods converge
   to analytical solutions of 2 dimensional problems at low Kn. However,
   solution accuracy is strongly determined by angular resolution for
   moderate to high Kn. Since the number of propagation directions in LBM
   are limited, significant errors are engendered in multi-dimensional
   acoustically-thin problems. DOM also suffers errors at low angular
   resolutions for high Kn, but yields accurate solutions when sufficient
   angular resolution is employed.}},

   Liquid ammonia-water solution flows in a falling-film mode around an

   installed in a test facility consisting of all components of a

   single-pressure test stands, here the experiments were conducted on the
   absorber at vapor, solution, and coupling fluid conditions
   representative of space-conditioning systems in the heating and cooling
   modes. Absorption measurements were taken over a wide range of solution
   flow rates, concentrations, and coupling fluid temperatures, which

Abstract = {{Hot spots on a microelectronic package can severely hurt the performance
   and long-term reliability of the chip. Thermoelectric coolers (TECs)
   have been shown to potentially provide efficient site-specific on-demand
   cooling of hot spots in microprocessors. TECs could lengthen the amount
   of time a processor is capable of running at full speed in the
   short-term and also provide long-term reliability by creating a more
   uniform temperature distribution across the chip. We have created a
   compact model for fast and accurate modeling of the TEC device
   integrated inside an electronic package. A 1-D compact model for TEC is
   first built in SPICE and has been validated for steady-state and
   transient behavior against a finite-volume model. The 1-D model of TEC
   was then incorporated into compact model of a prototype electronic
   package and simulations were performed to validate its steady state and
   transient behavior. This integrated compact model's results are in good
   agreement with a finite volume based model developed for TECs integrated
   inside a package and confirmed the compact model's ability to accurately
   model the TEC's interaction with package. The compact model has
   relatively small error when compared to the finite-volume based model
   and obtains results in a fraction of the time, reducing run-time in a
   transient simulation by 430\%. A simple controller was added to the
   electronic package and TEC model to provide an initial test of how the
   compact model can aid design of more complex control systems to
   efficiently operate the thermoelectric coolers.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the mainly incompressible and laminar flows of aqueous
   electrolyte solutions through channels with an overall dimension of
   O(1-100 mu m) is of interest in a variety of microfluidics applications.
   Solid surfaces such as the channel wall become (usually negatively)
   charged due to direct ionization or dissociation of surface groups,
   where the charge is typically characterized by the wall zeta-potential
   zeta(w). The surface in turn attracts mobile counterions from the fluid
   to form a (usually positively) charged screening, or electric double,
   layer (EDL).
   An external electric field can therefore be used to ``pump{''} fluids
   through microfluidic Labs-on-a-Chip (LOC) by driving the charged fluid
   in the EDL. The resulting electroosmotic flow (EOF) is uniform outside
   the EDL, which has a thickness less than 50 nm in most cases. This
   uniform flow results in a more favorable scaling of the volume flowrate
   with channel diameter for microchannels, and also has less convective
   dispersion than shear flows. Electroosmotic flow is, however, very
   sensitive to changes in zeta(w). Various studies have shown, for
   example, that adding multivalent counterions to a monovalent electrolyte
   solution can greatly change zeta(w) through both electrostatic and
   chemical interactions, even leading to ``charge inversion{''} where the
   zeta-potential changes its sign.
   Evanescent-wave particle velocimetry, which tracks the motion of
   colloidal fluorescent tracer particles illuminated by evanescent waves
   within 400 nm of the wall, was therefore used to study the flow of
   various aqueous monovalent electrolyte solutions with small amounts of
   divalent cations such as Mg++ driven by an electric field through
   channels with a minimum dimension of similar to 30 mu m. The technique
   measures both the velocity components parallel to the wall and the
   steady-state distribution of these near-wall tracers. In these
   experiments, the tracers are convected parallel to the wall by both the
   EOF and directly by the applied electric field via electrophoresis
   because the surfaces of the particles also become negatively charged
   when suspended in the electrolyte solution. The electrophoretic
   contribution to the measured particle velocity was determined by
   measuring the particle zeta-potential with light scattering, and
   subtracted from the particle velocity to determine the actual EOF
   velocity.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of condensation heat transfer and pressure
   drop of ammonia flowing through a single, circular, microchannel (D =
   1.435 mm) was conducted. The use of ammonia in thermal systems is
   attractive due to its high latent heat, favorable transport properties,
   zero ozone depletion (ODP), and zero global warming potential (GWP). At
   the same time, microchannel condensers are also being adopted to
   increase heat transfer performance to reduce component size and improve
   energy efficiency. While there is a growing body of research on
   condensation of conventional refrigerants (i.e., R134a, R404A, etc.) in
   microchannels, there are few data on condensation of ammonia at the
   microscale. Ammonia has significantly different fluid properties than
   synthetic HFC and HCFC refrigerants. For example, at T-sat = 60 degrees
   C, ammonia has a surface tension 3.2 times and an enthalpy of
   vaporization 7.2 times greater than those of R134a. Thus, models
   validated with data for synthetic refrigerants may not predict
   condensation of ammonia with sufficient accuracy.
   The test section consisted of a stainless steel tube-in-tube heat
   exchanger with ammonia flowing through a microchannel inner tube and
   cooling water flowing through the annulus in counterflow. A high flow
   rate of water was maintained to provide an approximately isothermal heat
   sink and to ensure the condensation thermal resistance dominated the
   heat transfer process. Data were obtained at mass fluxes of 75 and 150
   kg m(-2) s(-1), multiple saturation temperatures, and in small quality
   increments (Delta x similar to 15-25\%) from 0 to 1. Trends in heat
   transfer coefficients and pressure drops are discussed and the results
   are used to assess the applicability of models developed for both macro

Abstract = {{Tailoring radiative properties such as spectral control of thermal
   emission is beneficial in many applications such as space cooling and
   energy harvesting. The effect of magnetic polaritons (MPs) on spectral
   modulation has been analyzed previously and shown to exhibit
   omnidirectional behaviors when magnetic polaritons are excited in
   metallic grating structures with a dielectric spacer on a metallic film
   The present work provides an experimental demonstration of coherent
   thermal emission from such a microstructure in the infrared region at
   both room and elevated temperatures. Samples with different patterns are
   fabricated to study the geometric effect on the MPs. The emittance at
   elevated temperatures is directly measured using a home-built
   emissometer, while the room-temperature emittance is indirectly obtained
   from the reflectance measurements. The rigorous coupled-wave analysis
   and the LC model are employed to elucidate the mechanisms, by
   incorporating the Drude model with a temperature-dependent scattering
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature rise in LEDs is an important parameter that must be
   determined for both thermal management and device lifetime/reliability
   assessment. Commonly used indirect methods of measuring the device
   temperature either estimate the multiple quantum well (MQW) temperature
   based on measuring temperature dependent device characteristics (e.g.,
   forward voltage and electroluminescence methods), or they measure the
   average temperature across the device structure using optical methods
   such as infrared (IR) thermography and thermoreflectance. However, none
   give true insight into the vertical distribution of temperature in these
   structures. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is applied for the first
   time to operating UV LEDs to give the temperature rise in discrete
   layers within the LED device structure, going from the growth substrate
   to layers adjacent to theMQWs. Comparisons are made with IR themography
   to contrast with this depth sensitive measurement technique. It was
   observed that the peak temperatures in the device were much higher than
   the temperatures indicated by IR while the averaged temperatures through
   the structure compared favorably. Additional comparisons to
   electroluminescence measurements were also made which compared favorably
   with the peak temperatures found by Raman Spectroscopy.}},

   graphene decreases with the increasing strength of the interfacial
   interaction. The analysis shows that the interactions with copper
   substrate can reduce the thermal conductivity by up to 44\%. The
   decrease of thermal conductivity is primarily due to the suppression of

Abstract = {{The breakdown mechanism of carbon nanotube (CNT) networks is explored
   using a coupled electro-thermal model, which simulates both electrical
   and thermal transport in CNT network thin film transistors (CN-TFTs).
   The numerical results are validated against experimental observations on
   CN-TFTs with similar device geometry, network statistics, and thermal
   environment. We find the numerical predictions are in good agreement
   with experimental measurements of power and temperature of CN-TFT
   devices. Comparing the simulation results with experiments, we observe
   that the CNT-substrate thermal conductance per unit length is similar to
   0.1 Wm(-1) K-1. This value represents high contact thermal resistance,
   but is very close to experimental estimations. The thermal profile and
   breakdown behavior of the CNT network is observed to be more sensitive
   to CNT-substrate interfacial thermal conductance compared to that of the
   CNT-CNT interface. The effect of CNT network density on breakdown
   behavior is also analyzed for relatively low densities of the network.
   The peak power dissipation in CN-TFTs before breakdown increases with
   network density, and this peak power is reached at the same
   source-to-drain bias (V-SD) for all considered densities. The breakdown
   patterns in CN-TFTs of all considered densities are also observed to
   have similar characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporative cooling, which exploits the large latent heats associated
   with phase change, is of interest in a variety of thermal management
   technologies. Yet our fundamental understanding of thermal and mass
   transport remains limited. Evaporation and condensation can change the
   local temperature, and hence surface tension, along a liquid-vapor
   interface. The resulting thermocapillary stresses are dominant at small
   length scales in many cases.
   For the vast majority of single-component coolants, surface tension
   decreases as temperature increases, resulting in thermocapillary
   stresses that drive the liquid away from hot regions, leading to dryout,
   for example. The direction of flow driven by thermocapillary stresses is
   therefore consistent with that driven by buoyancy effects due to changes
   in the liquid density with temperature.
   However, a number of binary ``self-rewetting fluids,{''} consisting of
   water-alcohol mixtures, have surface tensions that increase with
   temperature, leading to thermocapillary stresses that drive liquid
   towards hot regions, improving cooling performance. Although not all
   binary coolants are selfrewetting, all such coolants are subject to
   solutocapillary stresses, where differential evaporation of the two
   fluid components leads to changes in local species concentration at the
   liquid-vapor interface, and hence in surface tension.
   Given the lack of general models of thermal and mass transport in
   nonisothermal two-phase flows, experimental studies of convection in
   simple fluids and binary alcohol-water mixtures due to evaporation and
   condensation driven by a horizontal temperature gradient were performed.
   In these initial studies, both the simple and binary fluids have
   thermocapillary stresses that drive liquid away from hot 889 regions.
   However, the binary fluid also has solutocapillary stresses that drive
   liquid towards hot regions. Particle-image velocimetry (PIV) is used to
   nonintrusively measure the velocity and temperature fields in a layer of
   liquid a few mm in depth in a 1 cm x 1 cm x 4.85 cm sealed and evacuated
   cuvette heated on one end and cooled on the other end.}},

Abstract = {{Rayleigh-Benard and Marangoni convection in a layer of a homogeneous
   fluid with a free surface in the absence of phase change is a classic
   (and extensively studied) problem of fluid mechanics. Phase change has a
   major effect on the convection problem. Most notably, significant latent
   heat generated at the free surface as a result of phase change can
   dramatically alter the interfacial temperature, and hence, the
   thermocapillary stresses. Furthermore, differential evaporation in
   binary fluids can lead to considerable variation in the concentration
   field, producing solutocapillarity stresses, which can compete with
   thermocapillarity and buoyancy.
   This talk describes numerical studies of convection in alcohol and
   alcohol-water mixtures due to a horizontal temperature gradient in the
   presence of phase change. We illustrate how the composition of the
   liquid and the presence of non-condensable gases (e.g., air) can be used
   to alter the balance of the dominant forces. In particular, by adding or
   removing air from the test cell, the direction of the flow can be
   reversed by emphasizing either the thermocapillary or the
   solutocapillary stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is a common damage process incurred by
   superalloys used for turbine components. Life modeling of TMF in
   superalloys has traditionally looked to phenomenological approaches for
   coupling the environmental-fatigue interactions occurring during TMF
   loading. While these approaches provide good predictive results within
   the range of test variables studied, they are not easily extrapolated to
   other conditions. A life model has been developed for single crystal
   Ni-base superalloys experiencing out-of-phase (OP) TMF which explicitly
   couples the interactions between the dominant damage mechanisms and the
   base material evolution affecting inelastic deformation. This paper
   concentrates on the fundamental physics of the deformation and damage
   processes which are the foundation for the model. This study represents
   a fundamental experimental/analytical/numerical approach to life
   prediction under complex loading and thermal conditions. It integrates
   detailed dislocation substructure development, microstructural
   evolution, oxidation, constitutive behavior, solid mechanics and
   numerical modeling; resulting in very accurate and robust TMF life
   prediction capability.}},

   It has been shown that the diffusion of hydroxide into the core of chips

Abstract = {{We studied the problem of sequentially testing M >= 2 hypotheses with a
   decentralized sensor network system. In such a system, the local sensors
   observe raw data and then send quantized observations to a fusion
   center, which makes a final decision regarding hypothesis is true.
   Motivated by the two-stage tests in Wang and Mei (2011), we propose a
   multistage decentralized sequential test that provides multiple
   opportunities for the local sensors to adjust to the optimal local
   quantizers. It is demonstrated that when the hypothesis testing problem
   is asymmetric, the multistage test is second-order asymptotically
   optimal. Even though this result constitutes an interesting theoretical
   improvement over two-stage tests that can enjoy only first-order
   asymptotic optimality, the corresponding practical merits seem to be
   only marginal. Indeed, performance gains over two-stage procedures with
   carefully selected thresholds are small.}},

Abstract = {{Signal and power integrity are crucial for ensuring high performance in
   high speed digital systems. As the operating frequency of digital
   systems increases, the power and ground bounce created by simultaneous
   switching noise (SSN) has become a limiting factor for the performance
   of these devices. SSN is caused by parasitic inductance that exists in
   the power delivery network (PDN), and voltage fluctuations on the power
   and ground rails can lead to reduced noise margins and can limit the
   maximum frequency of a digital device. A new PDN design has been
   suggested that achieves significantly reduced SSN {[}1] by replacing the
   power plane structure with a power transmission line (PTL). In this
   paper, a new power delivery scheme is shown to significantly reduce
   switching noise at lower power. This concept has been demonstrated
   through theory, simulation, and measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Single-ended (SE) signaling is preferable than differential signaling in
   high-speed memory interface designs, mainly because of less power and
   pin-count requirements. However, SE signaling is vulnerable to
   simultaneous switching noise (SSN) which is a major performance limiter.
   SSN is a function of the inductance of power and ground planes, which
   are the return paths for data signal lines. In recent literature, an
   assertion was posed that the impact of plane bounce on the SE signaling
   is not significant due to the compensation of noise by the voltage
   reference rail. In this paper, we set forth a counter-argument by
   presenting the noise analyses focusing on the impact of various voltage
   reference designs. In addition, we also show the decoupling method for a
   system using multiple voltages.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate quantification of gene or isoform expression with RNA-Seq
   depends on complete knowledge of the transcriptome. Because a complete
   genomic annotation does not yet exist, novel isoform discovery is an
   important component of the RNA-Seq quantification process. Thus, a
   typical RNA-Seq pipeline includes a transcriptome mapping step to
   quantify known genes and isoforms, and a reference genome mapping step
   to discover new genes and isoforms. Several tools implement this
   approach, but are limited in that they force the use of a single mapping
   algorithm at both the transcriptome and reference genome mapping stages.
   The choice of mapping algorithm could affect quantification accuracy on
   a per-dataset basis. Thus, we describe a method that enables the merging
   of transcriptome and reference genome mapping stages provided that they
   conform to the standard SAM/BAM format. This procedure could potentially
   improve the accuracy of gene or isoform quantification by increasing
   flexibility when selecting RNA-Seq data analysis pipelines. We
   demonstrate an example of a flexible RNA-Seq pipeline, assess its
   potential for novel isoform discovery and validate its quantification
   performance using qRT-PCR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents design and analysis of a flexonic mobile node (FMN)
   for structural health monitoring. Unlike rigid configurations with a
   fixed distance between the front and rear axles, this FMN features
   various deform able configurations in three-dimensional (3D) space by
   incorporating a compliant beam (connecting the front and rear axles with
   a controlled pin joint). Hence, this FMN has more flexibility to
   negotiate corners and attach sensors on ferromagnetic structures. These
   functions are facilitated by the guidance of an embedded vision
   controlled system. Controlling a continuous compliant beam is a
   challenging task in terms of nonlinear deformation with infinite degrees
   of kinematic redundancy Detailed discussion focuses on a theoretical
   beam model for simulating its 3D deformed shape. Results include the
   relations between input/output displacements and rotation angle for
   control implementation in sensor attachment and corner negotiation.
   Experiment is provided for model validation by comparing with the
   analysis for sensor attachment.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the animal kingdom produce motion by muscle contraction.
   Biological muscle can be viewed as a unidirectional actuator. To achieve
   bidirectional motion, each muscle has a corresponding antagonist muscle
   whose contraction produces motion in the opposite direction. This gives
   biological systems the unique ability to modulate the stiffness of a
   joint, which is important when interacting with the environment. Certain
   bio-inspired robotic systems incorporate antagonistic pairs in an
   attempt to produce similar desirable properties. The cellular actuator
   employs nested compliant mechanisms to produce human-scale motion from
   piezoelectric stack actuators, which on their own have a small
   displacement. The expression for the stiffness of the actuator composed
   of these mechanisms takes the form of a continued fraction, which
   results from the nested structure. In this way, the stiffness can be
   easily approximated to a desired degree of accuracy by considering only
   the outermost mechanisms.}},

   slithering through rubble or ratcheting up vertical tree trunks. Their
   adaptations for movement across complex dry terrain thus serve naturally
   as inspirations for search-and-rescue robotics. In this combined
   experimental and theoretical study, we perform experiments on inclined
   surfaces to show a snake's scales are critical anatomical features that
   enable climbing. We find corn snakes actively change their scale angle
   of attack by contracting their ventral muscles and lifting their bodies.
   We use this novel paradigm to design Scalybot, a two-link limbless robot
   with individually controlled sets of belly scales. The robot ascends
   styrofoam plates inclined up to 45, demonstrating a climbing ability
   comparable to that of a corn snake in the same conditions. The robot
   uses individual servos to provide a spatial and temporal dependence of
   its belly friction, effectively anchoring the stationary part of its
   body while reducing frictional drag of its sliding section. The ability
   to actively modulate friction increases both the robot's efficiency over
   horizontal surfaces and the limiting angles of inclination it can
   ascend.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coupled thermo-mechanical framework which takes into
   account the effect of phase transformation latent heat is presented for
   shape memory alloys. The governing equations are discretized for SMA
   bars and wires with circular cross sections by considering the
   non-uniform temperature distribution in the cross section. It is shown
   that a combination of three various effects (boundary condition, loading
   rate, and size) governs the intensity of temperature gradient in the
   cross section of SMA bars subjected to uniaxial loading. Also, it is
   shown that because of the strong coupling between the thermal and
   mechanical fields in SMAs, temperature difference in the cross section
   causes a non-uniform stress distribution in the cross section. The
   maximum non-uniformity in the stress and temperature distributions are
   calculated for a vast range of practical sizes, boundary conditions, and
   loading rates. The relation between the latent heat flux in the cross
   section and the rate dependency is studied. It is shown that the rate
   dependency in the response of SMAs cannot be studied independent of size
   and boundary condition effects. This phenomenon reveals that the
   definition of quasi-static loading is not absolute; it is affected by a
   number of parameters, e.g., the ambient condition and size of the
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{As processor architectures continue to evolve to increasingly
   heterogeneous and asymmetric designs, the construction of accurate
   performance models of execution time and energy consumption has become
   increasingly more challenging. Models that are constructed, are quickly
   invalidated by new features in the next generation of processors while
   many interactions between application and architecture parameters are
   often simply not obvious or even apparent. Consequently, we foresee a
   need for an automated methodology for the systematic construction of
   performance models of heterogeneous processors. The methodology should
   be founded on rigorous mathematical techniques yet leave room for the
   exploration and adaptation of a space of analytic models. Our current
   effort toward creating such an extensible, targeted methodology is
   Eiger. This paper describes the methodology implemented in Eiger, the
   specifics of Eiger's extensible implementation and the results of one
   scenario in which Eiger has been applied - the synthesis of performance
   models for use in the simulation-based design space exploration of
   Exascale architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Lane detection is an important problem in the field of intelligent
   transportation and safety driving, for which computer vision approaches
   are widely used. However, previous works involve unbalanced performance
   between robustness and speed, which makes it hard to be practical. In
   order to meet the requirements of safety driving, we present a new, fast
   and robust lane detection algorithm. It is based on searching lane
   marker candidates by the brightness feature and geometric matching from
   discrete segments to full lane markers, and then followed by a random
   noise filter. PathMark has been validated on a wide range of real world
   driving sequences, showing capability of extracting all kinds of lanes
   from different road conditions. Compared with previous work, PathMark
   operates at doubled frame rate on the embedded platform with comparable
   detection rate. PathMark is more suitable for real safety driving use in

   automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies can be further enhanced

   full set of acoustic and linguistic information existing at various
   levels of the speech knowledge hierarchy. This calls for a bottom-up
   knowledge integration framework that links speech processing with
   information extraction, by spotting speech cues with a bank of attribute
   detectors, weighing and combining acoustic evidences to form cognitive
   hypotheses, and verifying these theories until a consistent recognition
   decision can be reached. The recently proposed automatic speech
   attribute transcription paradigm is an attempt to extract relevant
   speech information, organize these evidences, and integrate them into
   the already-powerful, top-down hidden Markov modeling framework to
   facilitate a knowledge-rich, data-driven framework that will lower the
   entry barriers to ASR research, and still leverage upon many recent
   advances in automatic model learning. Everyone in and out of the current

Abstract = {{While the majority of traditional research in emotional speech
   recognition has focused on the use of a single database for assessment,
   it is clear that the lack of large databases has presented a significant

   cross-training emotional databases to examine consistency and
   reliability of acoustic measures in performing emotional assessment.
   This paper presents preliminary results on the use of glottal-based
   features in cross-testing (i.e., training on one database and testing on
   another) across 3 databases for emotion recognition of neutral, angry,
   happy, and sad. A comparative study is also presented using pitch-based
   features. The results suggest that the glottal features are more robust
   to the 4-class emotion classification system developed in this study and
   are able to perform well above chance for several of the cross-testing
   experiments.}},

   Each word in a vocabulary is initially modeled by well-trained triphone
   models. Maximum a posteriori adaptation is then applied to generate
   models for words with a large number of occurrences in the training set
   so that the acoustic distribution of the words can be modeled more
   precisely. Experimental results show that the proposed word-based
   systems outperform phone-based systems on the TIMIT task with a small
   training corpus. While in tasks with plenty of training data, word-based
   systems still show improvements over phone-based systems, such as the
   WSJ task. Furthermore the word-based systems have a better
   discriminating ability on short words and homophones. They are also more

Abstract = {{In this work(1), a novel acoustic characterization approach to
   multimedia event detection (MED) task for unconstrained and unstructured
   consumer-level videos through audio signal modeling is proposed. The key
   idea is to characterize the acoustic space of interest with a set of
   fundamental acoustic units around which a set of acoustic segment models
   (ASMs) is built. A vector space modeling technique to address MED is
   here adopted, where an incoming audio signal is first decoded into a
   sequence of acoustic segments. Then, a feature vector is generated by
   using co-occurrence statistics of acoustic units, and the MED final
   decision is implemented with a vector space language classifier.
   Experimental evidence on the TRECVID2011 MED demonstrates the viability
   of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it better accounts for temporal
   dependencies than previously proposed MFCC bag-of-word approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional high-fidelity geopotential computations rely on expensive
   spherical harmonics (SH) series. In this study an interpolation scheme
   is proposed that classically improves compute speed at the expense of
   memory. The approach is exact in the sense that accelerations are
   calculated naturally as the gradient of the fitted potential, and
   continuity and smoothness to arbitrary order are ensured across local
   cells using the Junkins weight functions. Millions of local
   interpolating functions are chosen with a new adaptive method that
   minimizes coefficient storage subject to a maximum error threshold.
   Analytic inversions of the normal equations associated with each
   candidate interpolant allow for rapid solutions to the least squares
   process without resorting to the conventional numerical linear system
   solvers. Accordingly, time is afforded to cycle through hundreds of
   candidate interpolants for each of the millions of nodes, resulting in a
   global model with a highly optimized memory requirement and uniform
   error distribution. Speed is ensured by choosing simple polynomials as
   candidate interpolants. For example, the interpolation approach (deemed
   FETCH) fitting the full GRACE02C 200 x 200 spherical harmonics (SH)
   field requires 1.8 Gigabytes of memory and achieves over 300x speedups
   compared to a Pines SH implementation. The error profile of the
   interpolation model is adaptively selected throughout the global domain
   to conservatively mirror the published expected errors of the SH fitting
   function.}},

Title = {{EVM and achievable data rate analysis of clipped OFDM signals in visible
   light communication}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered
   for visible light communication (VLC); thanks to its ability to boost
   data rates as well as its robustness against frequency-selective fading
   channels. A major disadvantage of OFDM is the large dynamic range of its
   time-domain waveforms, making OFDM vulnerable to nonlinearity of light
   emitting diodes. DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically
   clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) are two popular OFDM techniques
   developed for the VLC. In this article, we will analyze the performance
   of the DCO-OFDM and ACO-OFDM signals in terms of error vector magnitude
   (EVM), signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), and achievable data rates under
   both average optical power and dynamic optical power constraints. EVM is
   a commonly used metric to characterize distortions. We will describe an
   approach to numerically calculate the EVM for DCO-OFDM and ACO-OFDM. We
   will derive the optimum biasing ratio in the sense of minimizing EVM for
   DCO-OFDM. In addition, we will formulate the EVM minimization problem as
   a convex linear optimization problem and obtain an EVM lower bound
   against which to compare the DCO-OFDM and ACO-OFDM techniques. We will
   prove that the ACO-OFDM can achieve the lower bound. Average optical
   power and dynamic optical power are two main constraints in VLC. We will
   derive the achievable data rates under these two constraints for both
   additive white Gaussian noise channel and frequency-selective channel.
   We will compare the performance of DCO-OFDM and ACO-OFDM under different
   power constraint scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{An ionic-liquid (IL) is a salt in a liquid state usually with an organic
   cation and inorganic anion. ILs provide an alternative to the normally
   toxic working fluids in absorption systems, such as the ammonia/water
   system. They also eliminate the problems of poor temperature match,
   crystallization and metal-compatibility problems of the water/LiBr
   system. In the present study, an IL is explored the working fluid of a
   miniature absorption refrigeration system so as to utilize waste-heat
   within the system for low-cost, high-power electronics cooling. To
   determine performance benchmarks for the refrigerant/IL (e.g.
   {[}bmim]{[}PF6]) pairs, system-level simulations have been carried out.
   An NRTL model was built and used to predict the solubility of the
   mixture as well as the mixture properties such as enthalpy and entropy.
   The properties of the refrigerants were determined using REFPROP 6.0.
   Saturation temperatures at the evaporator and condenser were 25 degrees
   C and 50 degrees C, respectively. Chip power was fixed at 100 W with the
   operating temperature set at 85 degrees C. R32 gave the highest
   operating efficiency with the maximum coefficient of performance (COP)
   of ca. 0.55 while R134a and R152a showed comparable performance with the
   maximum COP of ca. 0.4 at the desorber outlet temperature of 80 degrees
   C. When waste-heat is available for the system operation, R134a and
   R152a COPs were comparable or better than that of R32.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates a correlation between the thermal efficiency
   of ideal power cycles and a structural measure of the degree of
   interactions in networks known as cyclicity. Efficient design of
   networks that reuse materials and energy motivates the work. Corporate
   ``take-back{''} plans, multi-company industrial symbioses and public
   recycling programs recover products, components and materials using
   partially closed loop networks. As resources become scarcer and more
   expensive, the prevalence of these networks is likely to increase, and
   the importance of designing efficient networks grows. Multiple
   structural and material flow metrics that one might use to aid network
   design exist. One novel approach to network design involves patterning
   industrial networks on ecological ones. This latter idea lays at the
   heart of industrial symbiosis efforts. However, neither the materials
   metric approach nor the bio-inspired ecological patterns approach stands
   upon a strong theoretical base. As a test of both approaches, this work
   uses a structural cycling metric, cyclicity, previously used to quantify
   patterns in ecosystems, to quantify energy flow in ideal thermodynamic
   cycles. The objective is not to learn about thermodynamic cycles.
   Rather, the intent of the comparison is to reveal whether trends in
   network structure as given by cyclicity relate to the fundamental laws
   of thermodynamics.
   Familiar ideal power cycles are first redrawn as energy flow networks.
   Cyclicity values are then calculated for these networks. A comparison
   shows that thermal efficiency increases with increasing cyclicity for
   fixed source and sink temperatures within a cycle. This results from the
   practice of adding cyclical energy paths (i.e. a regenerator) to an
   ideal power cycle, to increase thermal efficiency. The remainder of the
   article comments on the potential ramifications of this finding for the
   design of cycling industrial networks.}},

   decomposition (SVD) to control multiple subsystems with reduced inputs.
   The SVD System permits simultaneous, dependent control of sets of
   subsystems coupled by a row-column input design. The use of the SVD
   differs from previous applications because it is used to obtain a
   low-rank approximation of desired inputs. The row-column system allows
   many actuators to be controlled by a few inputs. Current control methods
   using the row-column system rely on scheduling techniques that permit
   independent actuator control but are too slow for many applications. The
   inspiration for this new control construct is a pin array human machine
   interface, called Digital Clay Some useful properties of the SVD will be
   discussed and the SVD System will be described and demonstrated in a

Abstract = {{Flexibility is often an unavoidable limitation when large-workspace
   high-speed manipulation is required. This flexibility can be mitigated
   in some circumstances through feedback control methods. However, these
   methods only correct for vibration after it has been measured.
   Therefore, if low-vibration reference commands can be generated, then
   the utility of these systems can be greatly improved. However, there are
   instances where system nonlinearities limit the effectiveness of many
   command-shaping techniques. This paper proposes a method for the
   generation of fast vibration-limiting trajectories for flexible systems
   based on the differential-flatness property of nonlinear systems. This
   approach is applied to a tower crane for simulation and experimental
   validation. The results are compared to those from standard
   command-shaping techniques. Practical implementation issues for real
   world systems are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Transition from single core to multicore technology has brought daunting
   challenge for thermal management of microprocessor chips. The issue of
   power dissipation in next generation chip will be far more critical as
   further transition from multicore to many-core processors is soon to be
   expected. It is very important to obtain uniform on-chip thermal profile
   with low peak temperature for improved performance and reliability of
   many-core processors. In this paper, a proactive thermal management
   technique called `power multiplexing' is explored for many-core
   processors. Power multiplexing involves redistribution of locations of
   power dissipating cores at regular time intervals to obtain uniform
   thermal profile with low peak temperature. Three different migration
   policies namely random, cyclic and global coolest replace have been
   employed for power multiplexing and their efficacy in reducing the peak
   temperature and thermal gradient on chip is investigated. A comparative
   study of these policies has been performed enlisting their limits and
   advantages from the thermal and implementation perspective considering
   important relevant parameters such as migration frequency. For a given
   migration frequency, global coolest replace policy is found to be the
   most effective among the three policies considered as this policy leads
   to 10 degrees C reduction in peak temperature and 20 degrees C reduction
   in maximum spatial temperature difference on a 256 core chip. Proximity

Abstract = {{The next generation of Thermal Interface Materials (TIMs) are currently
   being developed to meet the increasing demands of high-powered
   semiconductor devices. In particular, a variety of nanostructured
   materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are interesting due to their
   ability to provide low resistance heat transport from device to spreader
   and compliance between materials with dissimilar coefficients of thermal
   expansion (CTEs). As a result, nano-Thermal Interface Materials (nTIMs)
   have been conceived and studied in recent years, but few
   application-ready configurations have been produced and tested. Over the
   past year, we have undertaken major efforts to develop functional nTIMs
   based on short, vertically-aligned CNTs grown on both sides of a thin
   interposer foil and interfaced with substrate materials via metallic
   bonding. A high-precision 1-D steady-state test facility has been
   utilized to measure the performance of nTIM samples, and more
   importantly, to correlate performance to the controllable parameters.
   Nearly 200 samples have been tested utilizing myriad permutations of
   such parameters, contributing to a deeper understanding and optimization
   of CNT growth characteristics and application processing conditions. In
   addition, we have catalogued thermal resistance results from a variety
   of commercially-available, high-performance thermal pads and greases. In
   this paper, we describe our material structures and the parameters that
   have been investigated in their design. We report these nTIM thermal
   performance results, which include a best to-date thermal interface
   resistance measurement of 3.5 mm(2)-K/W, independent of applied
   pressure. This value is significantly better than all commercial
   materials we tested and compares favorably with the best results
   reported for CNT-based nTIMs in an application-representative setting.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we experimentally investigate the air flow distribution at

   fan speed is set to meet the air requirement of the high heat density
   rack. The effect of perforated tile air velocity on air distribution to
   both the racks is studied using particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   technique. PIV images are recorded at various rack heights corresponding
   to the locations of the servers in the rack. The PIV images recorded at
   various locations are stitched to construct a complete rack inlet air
   flow map. Three cases of rack air flow distributions are studied by
   varying the server work load and perforated tile flow rate. A
   significant change in the air distribution pattern is observed for the
   three cases investigated.}},

Abstract = {{In the past few years there have been a tremendous growth in distributed
   PV generation on commercial and residential buildings. Increasing
   distributed PV generation has raised concerns about the stability of the
   distribution grid due to the intermittency of solar PV energy. Before
   smart grid optimization and control algorithms can be formulated we must
   obtain a better understanding of the behavior of the distributed PV
   energy contributions to the electrical grid. This paper develops
   stochastic models to model each distributed energy source using both
   spatial and temporal processing. A goal is to develop simple stochastic
   models that accurately model the distributed energy produced from the PV
   sources with possible storage so that key events (e.g. ramp downs due to
   cloud cover can be characterized). The production of energy from PV
   panels is modeled as a queue with inputs being the nonstationary solar
   irradiation, the energy produced modeled by a deterministic function,
   and a queue modeled by storage which can be sold to the grid or used by
   local loads. A second queue models solar irradiation with inputs being
   weather conditions (sunny, partly cloudy, cloudy).}},

Abstract = {{Botnets have become a vital part of underground economy and botherders
   are actively looking for new recruits to join their bot army. A lapse by
   an end user or an administrator in terms of not updating their software
   enables the botherder to achieve this objective. In this paper we will
   investigate the phenomenon of a machine infection from the perspective
   of a user update behavior. We also present type of attacks that are
   launched by hackers to compromise machine and the vulnerabilities that
   lead to such attacks as a result of update behavior. We will also
   characterize the user update behavior on the test network of study.
   Finally we will compare the update behavior of machines that were
   infected with the ones that were not infected. The objective of this
   investigation is to see if update behavior could be used as an effective
   security metric, our trends show that there is a very clear correlation
   between the machines that were infected and the machines that were not

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient intrinsic finite element approach for
   modeling and analyzing the forced dynamic response of helical springs.
   The finite element treatment employs intrinsic curvature (and strain)
   interpolation vice rotation (and displacement) interpolation, and thus
   can accurately and efficiently represent initially curved and twisted
   beams with a sparse number of elements. The governing equations of
   motion contain nonlinearities necessary for large curvatures. In
   addition, a constitutive model is developed which captures coupling due
   to non-zero initial curvature and strain. The method is employed to
   efficiently study dynamically-loaded helical springs. Convergence
   studies demonstrate that a sparse number of elements accurately capture
   spring dynamic response, with more elements required to resolve higher
   frequency content, as expected. Presented results also document rich,
   amplitude-dependent frequency response. In particular, moderate
   amplitude response leads to the presence of secondary resonances not
   captured by linearized models.}},

Abstract = {{Consolidation through live VM migrations is a promising approach to
   improve server utilization. However, prior consolidation works have
   focused mostly on the performance impact of migration and neglected the
   associated energy overhead. Our research finds that energy impact of
   migration can offset over 12\% of the energy saved through
   energy-conscious workload packing To address this limitation of the
   current state of research, in this paper we devise new schemes to pack
   applications that targets a joint optimization of energy and performance
   overhead of VM migrations. Additionally, we develop a statistical
   workload modeling technique for simulating consolidation problem in
   enterprise cloud contexts. Our experiments with statistically generated
   synthetic trace and Google's production trace demonstrate that our
   schemes can improve energy savings up to 23\% compared to state of the

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has brought human genomic research to
   an unprecedented era. RNA-Seq is a branch of NGS that can be used to
   quantify gene expression and depends on accurate annotation of the human
   genome (i.e., the definition of genes and all of their variants or
   isoforms). Multiple annotations of the human genome exist with varying
   complexity. However, it is not clear how the choice of genome annotation
   influences RNA-Seq gene expression quantification. We assess the effect
   of different genome annotations in terms of (1) mapping quality, (2)
   quantification variation, (3) quantification accuracy (i.e., by
   comparing to qRT-PCR data), and (4) the concordance of detecting
   differentially expressed genes. External validation with qRT-PCR
   suggests that more complex genome annotations result in higher

Abstract = {{The work in this paper provides an approach to generate the optimal
   charge/discharge schedule for an EV plugged into a smart building. The
   building is assumed to be equipped with local solar generation and to be
   subjected to time-varying electricity pricing schemes such as
   time-of-use pricing (TOUP) or real: time pricing (RTP). Artificial
   neural networks (ANNs) are used to forecast the building's hourly energy
   consumption and solar generation from the point in time when the EV gets
   plugged-in until it is expected to depart. The optimization is defined
   as a linear programming problem that is solved using MATLAB's
   optimization toolbox. Degradation costs are accounted for to ensure that
   the additional cycling of the EV battery, which accelerates battery
   degradation, does not offset the benefits of short-term optimization.
   The optimal schedule is constrained to ensure that battery
   charge/discharge operational limits are respected, and that the EV is
   fully charged by the time the user is ready to leave the residence.
   Simulation models developed in MATLAB coupled with real weather, load,
   and pricing data are used to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Enabling intermediate nodes in networks with the capability of storing
   the past communication can offer several benefits. Recently, we have
   shown that by utilizing memory at intermediate nodes, one can compress
   the data stream sent from the source node with superior performance
   compared to the conventional end-to-end compression of individual
   sequences destined to each client. In other words, memorization or
   learning of past traffic at intermediate nodes provide extra compression
   gain. This gain comes from the fact that utilizing previous traffic
   shared between the source and intermediate nodes with memory helps to
   close the gap between the compression performance of universal
   compression techniques and entropy of each individual sequence. The gain
   of data traffic reduction depends on the number of memory units and
   their locations. Since in practical scenarios only a select number of
   nodes have the storage and computational capability to function as a
   memory unit, it is important to find the optimal location for such
   nodes. Furthermore, memory placement in the network poses some
   challenges to traditional shortest path routing algorithms, as the
   shortest path is not necessarily minimum cost route in networks with
   memory. In this paper, we investigate the memory placement problem and
   routing algorithms for networks featuring memory units for network
   compression. We derive the optimal memory placement strategy on line and
   grid networks. We further demonstrate how conventional routing
   algorithms should be modified when there are memory units in the
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/ gas turbine (GT) hybrid systems possess
   the capability to nearly double the efficiency of standard coal-fired
   power plants which are currently being used for large scale power
   production. For the purposes of investigating and developing this
   technology, a SOFC/GT hybrid test facility was developed at the U.S. DOE
   National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown, WV as part
   of the Hybrid Performance (HyPer) project. The HyPer facility utilizes
   hardware-in-the-loop technology to simulate coupled SOFC operation with
   gas turbine hardware in a hybrid arrangement. This paper describes and
   demonstrates the capabilities of the one-dimensional, real-time
   operating SOFC model that has been developed and successfully integrated
   into the HyPer facility. The model presented is designed to characterize
   SOFC operation over a broad and extensive operating range including
   inert heating and cooling, standard ``on-design{''} conditions and
   extreme off-design conditions. The model receives dynamic,
   system-dependent modeling inputs from facility hardware and calculates a
   comprehensive set of SOFC operational responses, thus simulating SOFC
   operation while coupled with a gas turbine. In addition to
   characterizing SOFC operation, the model also drives the only heat
   source in the facility to represent fuel cell subsystem release of
   thermal effluent to the turbine subsystem. Operating parameters such as
   solid and oxidant stream temperatures, fuel stream compositions, current
   density, Nernst potential and polarization losses are produced by the
   model in spatiotemporal manner. The capability of the model to
   characterize SOFC operation, within dynamic hybrid system feedback,
   through inert heat up and a step change in load is presented and
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Interfacial phenomena due to surface forces are important in
   microfluidic devices with their relatively large surface areas and small
   volumes. Most experimental studies of interfacial transport estimate
   flow velocities from the motion of tracer particles less than 1 mu m in
   diameter, and assume that the particle displacements over a known
   interval are due to the fluid velocity field. This talk discusses some
   of our research on measuring fluid velocities in Poiseuille and
   electrokinetically driven flows over the first similar to 0.5 mu m next
   to the solid wall from the motion of an ensemble of O(10(5)) fluorescent
   spheres as small as 100 nm illuminated by evanescent waves. Because the
   evanescent-wave intensity decays exponentially with wall-normal
   distance, the particle-wall separation can be determined from the
   brightness of each particle image, and used to estimate the steady-state
   distribution of the tracers near the fluid-solid interface.
   Recently, evanescent-wave illumination has been combined with
   fluorescence thermometry, where water temperature fields are estimated
   from changes in the intensity of the emissions from aqueous solutions of
   temperature-sensitive fluorophores. The Poiseuille flow of a fluorescein
   solution through a heated channel at a Reynolds number of 8.3 was
   illuminated with evanescent waves to obtain the solution temperature at
   an average distance of 74 nm from the wall. The temperature results
   obtained over three different regions were in good agreement with
   numerical predictions of the wall surface temperature, even in the
   presence of temperature differences exceeding 15 degrees C over the 1 mm
   width of the channel.}},

Abstract = {{Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery is a major
   health concern world-wide because of a large aging population and
   increased occurrence of sport-related damage. Tissue engineering is a
   rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that offers a promising new
   approach for ACL repair. In order to overcome the shortages of current
   existing surgical fixation devices, we are combining gradient cellular
   structure (GCS) injection molding technique and biomedical engineering
   to develop novel surgical fixation devices (screw, anchor, plate, pin,
   staple, etc.) that not only incorporate bioactive materials such as
   growth factors, healing drugs and cells, but have natural bone GCS
   structure, intended to mimic the natural bone and promote bone tissue
   growth and eventually eliminate the defects associated with existing
   surgical fixation devices. In this work, a series of novel poly-L-lactic
   acid (PLLA) scaffolds with micro-porous structure were prepared by
   injection molding an immiscible polymer blend, with spatially controlled
   thermal conditioning to adjust the phase size from core to surface. The
   produced scaffolds were observed under SEM, which shows a co-continuous
   structure was created successfully through our method. The
   biocompatibility and the feasibility of produced micro-porous structural
   PLLA and PLLA/HA scaffolds as a matrix supporting cell growth tested by
   culturing murine osteoblasts cell line (7F2) for up to 9 days were
   assessed by Alamar BIue (TM) assay, which showed that the manufacturing
   process had no negative effects on cell proliferation. The cell
   attachment, spreading, migration and proliferation to confluence were
   assessed by fluorescent nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. In order to
   evaluate the functional and cell biological applicability of the
   micro-porous structural PLLA scaffolds, a subcutaneous biodegradation
   test was performed through rat model for 1 week and 1 month time period,
   respectively. Our results showed that the micro-porous structural PLLA
   scaffolds are non-toxic, and they showed a mild foreign body reaction
   and complete fibrous encapsulation after implantation. Well created
   interconnected porous structure and biocompatibility suggest great
   potential of the micro-porous PLLA scaffolds in application for ACL
   reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates thermal transport in single wall carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the interfacial thermal interaction in
   double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation and wavelet methods. The simulations are performed on three
   groups of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as shown in Figure 1: 200 nm SWCNTs,
   200 nm DWCNTs with 50 nm cut in the middle, and 100 nm complete DWCNTs.
   A heat pulse is applied in the middle of the CNTs, and wavelike
   responses of temperature as well as its three components (radial,
   tangential, and longitudinal) along the CNTs are analyzed to explore the
   underlying thermal transport mechanism. Wavelet analysis is carried out
   on the three components of velocity to investigate the evolution of
   frequency spectrum along CNTs in time. The heat pulse analysis in SWCNTs
   shows that the longitudinal components propagate as the leading wave
   packet of heat at the largest speed but only carry a small fraction of
   the total energy. The high frequency radial components carry most of the
   energy and dominate in the middle diffusion regions. In DWCNTs, the
   radial components and tangential components carry most of the total
   energy while the longitudinal components carry only a small fraction of
   the total energy. We observe dramatic energy transfer from outer tube to
   inner tube of a DWCNT without any cut during the heating period. This
   energy transferred to inner tube is primarily contained in the slowly
   moving radial modes indicating that energy can be transferred
   effectively by the radial modes. However, the energy transfer between
   tubes of DWCNTs through tangential and longitudinal components is quite
   ineffective.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a miniaturization technology for
   heat and mass exchangers used in absorption heat pumps. The exchanger
   consists of an array of parallel, aligned alternating shims with
   integral microscale features, enclosed between cover plates. These
   microscale features facilitate the flow of the various fluid streams and
   the associated heat and mass transfer. In an absorber application,
   effective vapor and solution contact and microscale features for the
   flow of both the solution and the coolant induce high heat and mass
   transfer rates without any active or passive surface enhancement. The
   geometry ensures even flow distribution with minimal overall pressure
   drops. A model of the coupled heat and mass transfer process for
   ammonia-water absorbers using this configuration under typical operating
   conditions demonstrates the potential for extremely small absorption
   components. The proposed concept is compact, modular, versatile, and in
   an eventual implementation, can be mass produced. Additionally the same
   concept can be extended to the other absorption heat pump components as
   well as for several other industries involved in multi-component fluid

Abstract = {{This paper presents an offline fault diagnostics method for highly
   degraded industrial gas turbines. The method recasts gas path analysis
   to an inference problem using Bayesian networks where the health
   condition of each component is quantified in comparison to an expected
   value. The health parameters are inferred from available gas path
   measurements, which are sometimes erroneous due to sensor faults or
   miscalibration. The sensor errors should be inferred as well as the
   health parameters. Thus, typically in gas path analysis the unknowns are
   more than the knowns. To address this issue, the present method uses
   multiple Bayesian network models each of which contains a subset of the
   unknowns. Their results are averaged according to how much each of the
   models is supported by the data. Although this method has been reported
   successful for the faults affecting a few unknowns, its results are
   still less accurate and confident when it is applied to highly degraded
   gas turbines. Such gas turbines are likely to have health parameters
   deviated from the new and clean condition as well as have component
   faults and sensor errors. Because of this, the present method must infer
   too many unknowns at the same time to result in a solution with high
   confidence. In addition, this method cannot differentiate normal or
   expected degradation from an actual fault. These issues are resolved by
   fusing extra information to the method. First of all, a sensor
   calibration report, if available, eliminates the sensor errors from the
   unknowns. Consequently, the number of possible subsets decreases, and so
   does the number of Bayesian models. Second, a degradation model provides
   meaningful prior guesses for the health parameters. It is equivalent to
   change the point of reference from a brand new gas turbine to a normally
   degraded one. It will be demonstrated that the method accompanying with
   the degradation model and the sensor calibration report shows
   significant improvement in accuracy and confidence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents analytical linearization schemes of a reduced order
   aero-thermodynamic model of the generic back end of a turbofan engine.
   The proposed linearization scheme has advantages of flexibility and
   reusability over the commonly used linearization method based on the
   numerical perturbation scheme. Also, a blending algorithm employing the
   distance to the boundary as the weight has been incorporated into the
   linearization scheme to capture the change of the flow behaviour near
   bifurcating boundaries. The proposed linearization scheme is developed
   and applied to a back end model of a generic turbofan engine with
   bifurcations corresponding to choked/unchoked boundaries. This model is
   also used for proof of concept validation test.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for estimating compressor stall margin and
   the results of applying the estimation technique to an axial compressor
   rig. Stall margin estimation is accomplished through the use of a
   compressor stability detection parameter called the ``correlation
   measure.{''} The correlation measure captures the periodicity of the
   pressure in the rotor tip region of the compressor. The downcrossing
   frequency of the correlation measure across some preset threshold is
   measured while operating the compressor rig at various steady-state
   points along the design speed characteristic line. These measurements
   are used to generate a relationship with stall margin as a function of
   downcrossing frequency. The estimation technique is evaluated by
   applying it while dynamically ramping the operating point of the
   compressor up the design speed line towards surge. A brief investigation
   on the effects of inlet distortions on the correlation measure-based
   estimation system is also given.}},

Abstract = {{A key objective of compressor rig tests is the identification of
   compressor stall boundary. A complementary goal is the identification of
   the stalling stage based on test data. This serves two purposes: 1)
   Validate the pre-test prediction of the stage loading distribution, and
   2) identify the weak stages, should improvements in operating range be
   desired in subsequent design iterations. Typically the pertinent test
   data is in the form of static pressure measurements. Many engineers
   believe that a stalling stage is accompanied by a transient upstream
   pressure rise coupled with a downstream pressure loss. However,
   inter-stage dynamics may cloud the identification of the stalling stage.
   To this end, an analysis of inter-stage dynamics, immediately preceding
   the stall event, could provide an alternate assessment of the stalling
   stage. This work reviews existing stall models for studying compressor
   dynamics. The main focus of this work is to develop ability to capture
   inter-stage dynamics. A 3-state equation lumped Moore-Greitzer (MG3)
   model is widely used to study the dynamic compressor response during
   surge and rotating stall transients. However the evolution of MG3 model
   may not provide a suitable framework for the investigation of
   inter-stage dynamics. On the other hand, an unsteady time marching 1-D
   fluid dynamic model (e.g. similar to the DynTECC formulation which
   includes body forces), while unable to capture the rotating stall
   dynamics, is sufficient for this purpose. A numerical simulation has
   been developed to investigate the impact of stage characteristics, as
   well as load distribution on the compression and expansion waves that
   develop prior to a surge event. Through a controlled weakening of
   selected stages, the time evolution of these waves is related back to
   the stalling stage. It is found that the weakened stage is not
   necessarily the stalling stage as identified via the pressure rise and
   downstream pressure drop pattern.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data-driven clustering method based on the use of
   wavelet packet features for the study of functionally connected regions
   in the brain. In particular, wavelet packets are used because of their
   optimal whitening properties for 1/f-like processes, in association with
   a uniform segmentation of the frequency axis. Features obtained by the
   wavelet packet transform are grouped together using agglomerative
   clustering with standardize Euclidian distance. The results obtained are
   compared with known atlas of the rat brain and with results obtained
   from a technique based on the standard wavelet transform previously
   presented by the same authors. The presented approach produces clusters
   that are well matched to classical anatomical regions in the
   sensorimotor cortex of the rat brain and also produces clusters that
   roughly correspond to primary motor, primary somatosensory and secondary
   somatosensory areas, with the subcortical clusters typically comprising
   one or two groups in the caudate putamen area.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-antenna transmit beamforming is a well-adopted technique at base
   stations to reduce interference and improve communication quality. The
   radiation pattern in beamforming is determined by both the weights and
   configurations of antenna array. In base stations, orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals and multi-carrier
   wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) signals exhibit high
   peak-to-average-power ratios (PAPRs), causing them to be susceptible to
   non-linear distortions of power amplifiers (PAs). The beam patterns may
   be impaired as well. Due to the beamforming weights, the transmitted
   signals on multiple chains can have different average and peak powers.
   In addition, the PAs on different chains can exhibit different
   non-linear characteristics. Therefore, multi-antenna transmit
   beamforming with non-linearity is more complicated than that for single
   chain transmission. In this paper, we will study transmit beamforming
   systems with peak power constraints by assuming that the PA follows a
   soft limiter model. We will establish a framework for analyzing clipping
   effects in transmit beamforming systems. Three metrics will be adopted
   to characterize the impairments: (i) the power gain pattern; (ii) the
   beamforming error pattern; and (iii) the signal-to-distortion power
   ratio (SDR) pattern. Both numerical derivations and simulations will be
   provided to assess the proposed metrics.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed the stranded HMM to achieve a more accurate
   representation of heterogeneous data. As opposed to the regular Gaussian
   mixture HMM, the stranded HMM explicitly models the relationships among
   the mixture components. The transitions among mixture components encode
   possible trajectories of acoustic features for speech units. Accurately
   representing the underlying transition structure is crucial for the
   stranded HMM to produce an optimal recognition performance. In this
   paper, we propose to learn the stranded HMM structure by imposing
   sparsity constraints. In particular, entropic priors are incorporated in
   the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the mixture transition
   matrices. The experimental results showed that a significant improvement
   in model sparsity can be obtained with a slight sacrifice of the
   recognition accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Video streaming over wireless and cellular networks is severely hampered
   by the presence of burst errors and signal loss intervals. In this
   paper, we propose a scheme for error-resilient video streaming known as
   Multiple Representation Coding (MRC). In the MRC scheme, multiple
   independently decodable representations are generated from the source
   video. These multiple representations are then temporally dispersed and
   transmitted as a single video stream using a novel GOP interleaving
   scheme (GOP: Group of Pictures). By temporally dispersing the multiple
   representations, the GOP-interleaver ensures that spatio-temporally
   co-located segments of the video sequence corresponding to different
   representations are not impaired by the same burst loss, even when
   transmitted over a single channel. Simulation results demonstrate that
   in contrast to conventional full-size encoding and transmission of the
   video sequence, the MRC scheme can facilitate a graceful recovery from
   impairments introduced by burst and signal losses over the network.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the features of radiation pattern in down
   tilt beam forming (a user-specific vertical beamforming) when applying
   the clipping technique at each antenna to reduce the peak-to-average

   radiation pattern in one-beam downtilt, and then prove that the clipping
   noise in one-beam downtilt systems has the same radiation pattern as
   that of the original signal but changes in two-beam downtilt systems.
   Next, we split the clipping noise into two parts in two-beam down tilt,
   desired noise and undesired noise, and demonstrate that desired noise
   produces the same radiation pattern as that of the original signal while
   undesired noise creates undesired radiation pattern, which causes
   unexpected noise pattern in two-beam down tilt. Simulation results show
   that the analysis well matches the numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{The iMachine is a spring-loaded turntable used to measure inertial
   properties of irregularly shaped rigid bodies, specifically manual
   wheelchairs. We used a Newton-Euler approach to calculate wheelchair
   mass and center of mass (CM) location from static force measurements
   using load cells. We determined the moment of inertia about the vertical
   axis from the natural frequency of the system in simple harmonic motion.
   The device was calibrated to eliminate the effects of platform
   components on measurement error. For objects with known inertial
   properties, the average relative error of the mass and the CM
   coordinates (x and y) were 0.76\%, 0.89\%, and 1.99\%, respectively. The
   resolution of the moment of inertia calculation depends on the ratio of
   test piece inertia to system inertia, such that the higher the ratio,
   the more accurate the measurements. We conducted a Gage Repeatability
   and Reproducibility (Gage R\&R) test using three manual wheelchairs
   measured three times by three operators; the results showed that over
   90\% of the variance in inertia was caused by differences in the
   wheelchairs being measured. Gage R\&R analysis indicated that
   measurement system operation was acceptable using criteria from the
   Automobile Industry Action Group for both inertia and mass measurements.}},

   We extended and demonstrated the capability of a recently developed
   hybrid approach in modeling several decades of length scale from package
   to chip at a considerably lower computational cost, while maintaining
   satisfactory accuracy. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
   technique was used for the rapid prediction of the transient thermal
   response for impulsive vs. oscillatory power applied to the chip. The
   results were compared with a detailed finite element (FE) model
   developed in COMSOU (R). The close agreement between the two models
   confirms the capability of the multi-scale model in rapidly predicting
   accurate temperature profiles, without performing detailed FE
   simulations, which can significantly decrease the computational cost in
   parametric modeling.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in maintaining quality and reliability in today's
   microelectronics devices comes from the ever increasing level of
   integration in the device fabrication as well as the high level of
   current densities that are carried through the microchip during
   operation. Cyclic thermal events during operation, stemming from Joule
   heating of the metal lines, can lead to fatigue failure due to the
   varying thermal expansion coefficients of the different materials that
   compose the microchip package. To aid in the avoidance of such device
   failures, it is imperative to develop a predictive capability for the
   thermal response of micro-electronic circuits. This work studied the
   problem of transient Joule heating in interconnects in a two-dimensional
   (2D) inhomogeneous system using a reduced order modeling approach of the
   Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method and Galerkin Projection
   Technique. This study considers an interconnect structure embedded in
   the bulk of a microelectronic device. The effect of different types of
   current pulses, pulse duration, and pulse amplitude were investigated.
   By using a representative step function as the heat source, the model
   predicted the exact transient thermal behavior of the system for all
   other cases without generating any new observations, using just a few
   POD modes. To validate this unique capability, the result of the POD
   model was compared with a finite element (FE) model developed in LS-DYNA
   (R). The behaviors of the POD models were in good agreements with the
   corresponding FE models. This close correlation provides the capability
   of predicting other cases based on a smaller sample set which can
   significantly decrease the computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{A Carrier Ethernet Network (CEN) is a versatile, standardized,
   ubiquitous, carrier-class network. It possess several attributes that
   distinguish it from Metro Ethernet Networks (MENs), quality of service
   (QoS) being an integral one. Because CENs are designed to cover large
   areas (thousands of km) and transmit at high data rates (100 Gbps),
   these networks have a high bandwidth-delay product (BDP). Long distance
   transmissions that require data integrity suffer a transport-layer
   throughput bottleneck effect. Under these conditions, systems (including
   testbeds) exhibit a detrimental performance evaluation reduction as the
   round-trip time (RTT) increases. A new transport protocol is proposed to
   overcome the difficulties these networks incur, while providing QoS
   guarantees at the transport-layer level, hence maintaining the committed
   throughput levels established in the service level agreement (SLA). The
   proposed protocol, which is called Ethernet Services transport protocol
   (ESTP), is able to obtain congestion level feedback using only layer-4
   information rather than assuming congestion based on a single packet
   loss event. An important aspect of this work is that it is validated by
   theoretical, simulated, and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Bloch analysis was originally developed to solve Schrodinger's equation
   for the electron wave function in a periodic potential field, such as
   found in a pristine crystalline solid In the context of Schrddinger's
   equation, damping is absent and energy is conserved More recently, Bloch
   analysis has found application in periodic macroscale materials, such as
   photonic and phononic crystals. In the vibration analysis of phononic
   crystals, structural damping is present together with energy
   dissipation. As a result, application of Bloch analysis is not
   straight-forward and requires additional considerations in order to
   obtain valid results. It is the intent of this paper to propose a
   general framework for applying Bloch analysis in such systems. Results
   are presented in which the approach is applied to example phononic
   crystals. These results reveal the manner in which damping affects
   dispersion and the presence of band gaps in periodic systems.}},

Abstract = {{Of the total electricity consumption by the United States in 2006, more
   than 1\% was used on data centers alone; a value that continues to rise
   rapidly. Of the total amount of electricity a data center consumes, at
   least 30\% is used to cool server equipment. The present study
   conceptualizes and analyzes a novel paradigm consisting of integrated
   power, cooling, and waste heat recovery and upgrade systems that
   considerably lowers the energy footprint of data centers. Thus, on-site
   power generation equipment is used to supply primary electricity needs
   of the data center. The microturbine-derived waste heat is recovered to
   run an absorption chiller that supplies the entire cooling load of the
   data center, essentially providing the requisite cooling without any
   additional expenditure of primary energy. Furthermore, the waste heat
   rejected by the data center itself is boosted to a higher temperature
   with a heat transformer, with the upgraded thermal stream serving as an
   additional output of the data center with no additional electrical power
   input. Such upgraded heat can be used for district heating applications
   in neighboring residential buildings, or as process heat for commercial
   end uses such as laundries, hospitals and restaurants. With such a
   system, the primary energy usage of the data center as a whole can be
   reduced by about 23 percent while still addressing the high-flux cooling
   loads, in addition to providing a new income stream through the sales of
   upgraded thermal energy. Given the large and fast-escalating energy
   consumption patterns of data centers, this novel, integrated approach to
   electricity and cooling supply, and waste heat recovery and upgrade will
   substantially reduce primary energy consumption for this important end
   use worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately two-thirds of all input energy used for power and
   electricity generation in the USA is lost as heat during conversion
   processes. Additionally, 12.5\% of primary fuel and 20.3\% of the
   electricity generated through these processes are employed for space
   heating, water heating, and refrigeration where low-grade heat could
   suffice. The potential for harnessing waste heat from power generation
   and thermal processes to perform these low-grade tasks is assessed here.
   By matching power plant outlet streams with applications at
   corresponding temperature ranges, this study identifies sufficient waste
   heat to satisfy all residential, building, and manufacturing space and
   water heating needs. Sufficient high temperature exhaust from power
   plants is identified to satisfy 27\% of residential air conditioning
   demand with thermally activated refrigeration or all industrial low

Abstract = {{Gaps in real-time and archived traffic data are common and can be
   attributed to several factors, such as sensor failures and data
   communications interruptions. Regardless of the cause of the missing
   data, these gaps often must be filled with reliable and accurate
   estimates before the data can be used for planning, operations, or
   congestion-mitigation purposes. This research compared different methods
   for imputing missing values in video detection system data, including
   historical averages, simple linear regression, multiple linear
   regression, spatial averages, and Newell's simplified kinematic wave
   model. The study used the fundamental relationship between speed and
   flow in filtering the data for quality control. A sensitivity analysis
   tested the response of different methods to factors such as the size of
   training data set and time-of-day adjustments to the algorithms. The
   results indicated that the time of day and volume adjustment factors had
   a nontrivial impact on the accuracy of the outputs. Despite significant
   errors in the base data set, the Newell algorithm performed on a par
   with the other methods in terms of bias and mean absolute percentage,

   developed a supply chain process model that determines the consequence

   exiting the production system. An attacker-defender sequential game
   model is also developed to determine the likelihood that the system is
   successfully attacked as a function of how the targets are protected in
   the presence of an intelligent attacker. The combined model determines
   the expected impact of a successful attack and provides near optimal

Abstract = {{Site-specific and on-demand cooling of hot spots in the microprocessors
   can provide efficient cooling solution, improve its performance and
   increase its life time by reducing peak temperature and achieving more
   uniform thermal profile on the chip. Thermoelectric coolers (TEC) have
   the potential to provide such efficient cooling of hot spots on a chip.
   We investigate pulse cooling behavior of ultra-thin multiple TEC devices
   integrated inside the electronic package on the active side of a chip
   below the heat spreader. Various pulse profiles have been studied to
   obtain optimal shape of the current pulse in order to efficiently
   operate TECs considering crucial parameters such as the total energy
   consumed in TECs, peak temperature on the chip, temperature overshoot at
   hot spot and settling time during pulsed cooling of hot spots. The
   square root pulse profile is found to be most effective with maximum
   cooling and half the energy expenditure in comparison to a constant
   current pulse. It has been observed that high thermal contact
   resistances can entirely negate the transient cooling effect of the
   TECs. We analyze the operation of multiple TECs for cooling
   spatiotemporally varying hot spots. The analysis shows that the
   temperature of the hot spots can be retained below a threshold using
   transient current pulses through the TECs. This underlines the benefits
   of using multiple TECs for hot spot cooling in order to obtain favorable
   thermal profile on the chip in an energy efficient way.}},

Abstract = {{The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between a die and an
   organic substrate generates high stresses in the die when underfilled
   solder bumps are used. These high stresses could crack or delaminate
   low-K dielectric materials in the next-generation flip-chip devices. In
   addition to such on-chip failures, the solder interconnects could fail
   due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, especially when the interconnect
   dimensions are scaled down to meet fine-pitch requirements. To address
   these reliability issues, compliant interconnects have been proposed to
   alleviate the thermo-mechanical stresses in the chip assembly. Some of
   the challenges to be addressed with compliant interconnects are: higher
   electrical parasitic compared to solder bumps, cost-effective
   fabrication, and high-yield, fine-pitch assembly process.
   This paper presents a study on a parallel-path compliant interconnect
   design which attempts to balance between mechanical compliance and
   electrical parasitics by using multiple electrical paths in place of a
   single electrical path. The high compliance of the parallel-path
   compliant interconnect structure will ensure the reliability of low-K
   dies. Also, these interconnects can be cost effective by using a
   wafer-level process and by eliminating the underfill process.
   Although an underfill is not required for thermo-mechanical reliability
   purposes, an underfill may be used for reducing contamination and
   oxidation of the interconnects and also to provide additional rigidity
   against mechanical loads. Therefore, this paper also examines the role
   of an underfill on the thermo-mechanical reliability of a parallel-path
   compliant interconnect.}},

Abstract = {{Through-silicon vias (TSVs), being one of the key enabling technologies
   for 3D system integration, are being used in various 3D vertically
   stacked devices. As TSVs are relatively new, there is not enough
   information in available literature on the thermo-mechanical reliability
   of TSVs. Due to the high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch
   between Si and the Cu vias, ``Cu pumping{''} will occur at high
   temperature and ``Cu sinking{''} will occur at low temperature, which
   may induce large stress in SiO2, interfacial stress at Cu/SiO2 interface
   and plastic deformation in Cu core. The thermal-mechanical stress can
   potentially cause interfacial debonding, cohesive cracking in dielectric
   layers or Cu core, causing some reliability issues. Thus, in this paper,
   three-dimensional thermo-mechanical finite-element models have been
   built to analyze the stress/strain distribution in the TSV structures. A
   comparative analysis of different via designs, such as circular, square,
   and annular vias has been performed. In addition, defects due to
   fabrication such as voids in the Cu core during electroplating and Cu
   pad undercutting due to over-etching are considered in the models, and
   it is seen that these fabrication defects are detrimental to TSV
   reliability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new approach is developed for estimating discrete choice
   modeling parameters for data sets in which one of the alternatives is
   never observed to have been chosen. This estimation approach, inspired
   by methods used in revenue management, is applied to a multinomial logit
   model that has a full set of identifiable alternative specific
   constants. Parameter estimates are found by combining disaggregate data
   (obtained from a random or exogenous sample) with aggregate observations
   of market shares for the observed choices. The method provides an
   estimate of the market share for the alternative that was not observed
   to be chosen in the estimation data set. This estimate is significant
   because it suggests that the transportation community can forecast
   demand for a new alternative or demand for alternatives that are
   expensive to collect with intercept surveys without having observations
   for individuals who have chosen these alternatives. The methodology can
   be extended to other generalized extreme value models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the design trade-offs in architecting large-scale
   DRAM caches. Prior research, including the recent work from Loh and
   Hill, have organized DRAM caches similar to conventional caches. In this
   paper, we contend that some of the basic design decisions typically made
   for conventional caches (such as serialization of tag and data access,
   large associativity, and update of replacement state) are detrimental to
   the performance of DRAM caches, as they exacerbate the already high hit
   latency. We show that higher performance can be obtained by optimizing
   the DRAM cache architecture first for latency, and then for hit rate.
   We propose a latency-optimized cache architecture, called Alloy Cache,
   that eliminates the delay due to tag serialization by streaming tag and
   data together in a single burst. We also propose a simple and highly
   effective Memory Access Predictor that incurs a storage overhead of 96
   bytes per core and a latency of 1 cycle. It helps service cache misses
   faster without the need to wait for a cache miss detection in the common
   case. Our evaluations show that our latency-optimized cache design
   significantly outperforms both the recent proposal from Loh and Hill, as
   well as an impractical SRAM Tag-Store design that incurs an unacceptable
   overhead of several tens of megabytes. On average, the proposal from Loh
   and Hill provides 8.7\% performance improvement, the ``idealized{''}
   SRAM Tag design provides 24\%, and our simple latency-optimized design
   provides 35\%.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is a growing health problem in the United States, especially
   among children. Indicators show that the rate of obesity for children
   age 12-19 years old has risen from 5\% percent to 18\% over the last ten
   years. To deal with the obesity epidemic, a number of technology
   interventions, including the use of robotics and virtual reality games,
   have arisen to motivate youth to become physically active. The
   difficulty though lies in providing a tool for health professionals to
   embed established clinical health protocols into these technologies. As
   such, in this paper we present a mixed reality system that translates
   physical demonstrations of various exercise protocols into movements for
   a robotic agent. This is accomplished by mapping real-time data from an
   RGB-D sensor to a robotic exercise coach. Details of the system are
   discussed and results from evaluation with 20 human subjects are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{A Model Driven Architecture approach is employed to support the practice
   of discrete-event simulation. OMG's System Model Language, OMG SysML
   (TM), is used to define a platform independent model (PIM) and
   auto-translate it into an appropriate platform specific model (PSM). The
   implementation and the nature of the transformation from PIM to PSM are
   clearly addressed to enable: (i) formal modeling of systems using their
   own semantics in SysML, (ii) SysML model verification and validation by
   stakeholders, (iii) automatic translation of system models expressed in
   SysML into analysis models as the PSM, and (iv) maintainability of this
   approach to accommodate system changes and extensions very easily. The
   proposed approach can be used for any analysis tool and application
   domain. In this paper, we choose to model transaction-based examples
   elicited from the manufacturing domain in SysML and translate them into
   Arena T models using the Atlas Transformation Language.}},

Abstract = {{Aviation spare parts provisioning is a highly complex problem.
   Traditionally, provisioning has been carried out using a conventional
   Poisson-based approach where inventory quantities are calculated
   separately for each part number and demands from different operations
   bases are consolidated into one single location. In an environment with
   multiple operations bases, however, such simplifications can lead to
   situations in which spares - although available at another airport -
   first have to be shipped to the location where the demand actually
   arose, leading to flight delays and cancellations. In this paper we
   demonstrate how simulation-based optimisation can help with the
   multi-location inventory problem by quantifying synergy potential
   between locations and how total service lifecycle cost can be further
   reduced without increasing risk right away from the Initial Provisioning
   (IP) stage onwards by taking into account advanced logistics policies
   such as pro-active re-balancing of spares between stocking locations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automated GPS-based method for assessing
   construction equipment operations productivity. The literature revealed
   several shortcomings in simulation of construction equipment, for
   example, the availability of realistic data that supports a simulation
   framework, and identified the need for integrating real-time field data
   into simulations. Commercially available GPS-based data logging
   technology was then evaluated. Analysis methods and rules for monitoring
   productivity were also discussed. A software interface was created that
   allowed to analyze and visualize several important parameters towards
   creating more realistic simulation models. The experimental results
   showed a productivity assessment method by collecting spatio-temporal
   data using GPS data logging technology, applied to construction
   equipment operations, and finally identified and tracked productivity
   and safety based information for job site layout decision making. This
   research aids construction project managers in decision making for
   planning work tasks, hazard identification, and worker training by
   providing realistic and real-time project equipment operation

   Dielectric}},
Journal = {{ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{N6-N13}},
Abstract = {{Polymer dielectrics are widely used in micro-electro-mechanical systems
   (MEMS) and electronic packaging. Fully curing polymer dielectrics can
   require lengthy cure cycles. Microwave-induced reactions and curing can
   occur at temperatures lower than convective heating systems due to
   localized energy absorption, resulting in faster thermal curing of
   polymer dielectrics. In this study, the epoxy-based cross-linking and
   curing of a negative-tone photosensitive polynorbornene (PNB) dielectric
   by variable-frequency microwave (VFM) processing was investigated as a
   function of cure time and cure temperature. In additional, the
   feasibility of curing the polymer in air compared to traditional
   nitrogen ambient curing was studied. The chemical changes occurring
   during the cross-linking of the polymer and the effect of processing
   conditions on the degree of cross-linking in cured films were monitored
   by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR studies show
   that the chemical structure of VFM-cured PNB films is the same as
   thermally-cured films. The results also show that rapid curing of PNB by
   VFM in as little as five minutes is feasible. Further, a significantly
   higher rate of chemical conversion can be achieved by VFM processing at
   temperatures lower than conventional thermal curing. The properties of
   the cured films were studied by comparing the chemical, mechanical, and
   electrical properties of VFM-cured films to those of the thermally-cured
   films. The VFM-cured films showed comparable or improved properties
   compared to the thermally-cured films. The VFM-cured films exhibited
   higher hardness, higher reduced modulus, and a lower degree of swelling
   compared to the thermally-cured samples. The residual stress and
   dielectric constant of VFM-cured films were slightly higher than those
   of the conventionally-cured films. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

   Pavement Textures for Super-Thin Resurfacing on 1-95}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{144-150}},
Abstract = {{Funding shortages create pavement preservation challenges for state
   departments of transportation (DOTs). The Georgia DOT developed an
   innovative micromilling resurfacing method as a cost-effective way to
   preserve its pavements. The new method can save more than \$5 million on
   an 1-95 project of 84 lane miles. To ensure that the micromilled surface
   texture has a good bond and good runoff capability, the Georgia DOT
   established a stringent ridge-to-valley-depth (RVD) specification.
   Preliminary tests were conducted on an I-75 project with a circular
   track meter and an ultralight inertia profiler, but the RVD was first
   measured with a laser road profiler for the entire 84 lane miles of the
   I-95 project. The rough and smooth micromilled pavement surfaces have
   been studied and compared through an exploration of their statistical
   characteristics and patterns. Results from four 0.5-mi segments showed
   that both smooth and rough surface textures revealed normal
   distributions, although a smooth surface had a slight lognormal
   distribution. The smooth surface had a mean of about 2.5 mm and a
   standard deviation of 0.9 mm. The rough surface had a mean of about 4.6
   mm and a standard deviation of about 1.1 mm. The cumulative percentage
   curves for both rough and smooth surface textures showed that the mean
   RVD value of 3.2 mm could effectively differentiate rough and smooth
   surfaces. The effects of different base lengths on the RVD were studied,
   and results showed that a 100-mm base length was adequate to
   differentiate between smooth and rough surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a reversible response matrix and the dynamic interplay, as a
   moderately acidic NO2 analyte interacts at room temperature with a TiO2,
   SnOx, CuxO (x = 1,2), and A(x)O (x >> 1) metal oxide nanostructure
   deposited n-type nanopore coated microporous porous silicon (PS)
   interface. A significant variable response matrix is measured and the
   dynamic nature of analyte-interface processes characterizing the
   semiconductor-analyte interaction as NO2 couples to the decorated
   semiconductor majority charge carriers. The competition for electrons
   between NO2 and the TiO2 decorated PS interface leads to distinct
   variations in sensor response as a function of increased TiO2
   concentration and displays a time variance as the extraction of
   electrons by NO2 reaches a limiting charge carrier depletion and the
   decorated PS surface becomes electron withdrawing. This dynamic reversal
   is also demonstrated by distinct time-dependent PS interface responses
   to NO2 and NO where the degree of electron extraction reaches a maximum
   and is again countered by the depleted n-type PS. Electron depleted SnOx
   and AuxO treated PS interfaces display a significant remnant effect as
   the decorated surface can become electron withdrawing for extended
   periods, forming a stronger acid and extracting electrons from NO2.
   Exposure to NH3 also demonstrates the remnant effects of depletion. (C)

Abstract = {{The short circuit behavior of Type I (fixed speed) wind
   turbine-generators is analyzed in this paper to aid in the protection
   coordination of wind plants of this type. A simple network consisting of
   one wind turbine-generator is analyzed for two network faults: a three
   phase short circuit and a phase A to ground fault. Electromagnetic
   transient simulations and sequence network calculations are compared for
   the two fault scenarios. It is found that traditional sequence network
   calculations give accurate results for the short circuit currents in the
   balanced fault case, but are inaccurate for the un-faulted phases in the
   unbalanced fault case. The time-current behavior of the fundamental
   frequency component of the short circuit currents for both fault cases
   are described, and found to differ significantly in the unbalanced and
   balanced fault cases.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing penetration of intermittent non-dispatchable renewable
   resources to the power grid could result in a less reliable and secure
   system if the intermittency is ignored. An additional effect of
   intermittency is the cycling of thermal units as the thermal units are
   controlled under an economic dispatch controller. This paper proposes an
   approach to smoothen the intermittency and therefore minimize thermal
   unit cycling by controlling demand and other customer owned resources.
   Specifically, a hierarchical optimization and coordination algorithm is
   proposed that takes advantage of the control capabilities of these
   resources and optimizes their operation with the ultimate goal to
   minimize system operating cost and maximized reliability. A byproduct of
   this optimization is the reduced cycling of dispatchable generating
   units. Results are demonstrated on a utility scale system with various
   levels of wind penetration using actual wind generation patterns. It is
   shown that while the objective of the optimization is the minimization
   of the overall operating cost of the system, the optimal solution also
   reduces the number of cycles and the average MW variation per cycle.
   This minimization of thermal unit wear and tear increases the
   reliability of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Complex systems consist of a large number of entities with their
   independent local rules and goals, along with their interactions. In the
   operations of complex system, such as naval ship, proper decisions and
   controls are required to keep the system working functionally and
   effectively. An Integrated Reconfigurable Intelligent System (IRIS)
   framework is proposed for facilitating the design and operation of such
   naval complex systems through increased automation and
   reconfigurability. With the reconfigurable systems, the IRIS designed
   ship will assess the incoming information and then configure itself into
   the mode most adequate to deal with the situation under consideration.
   The study in this paper presents a hierarchical control architecture to
   deal with ever-evolving real time information and making autonomous
   control for achieving the reconfigurability of naval ship. The control
   architecture consists of three levels working together to achieve the
   overall operational goal. It is implemented on a resource allocation
   problem for a chilled water system. The successful resource allocation
   leads to a reconfiguration of the system which is the most suitable to
   handle the situation at hand.}},

   performance. The optimum control parameter value is found using a
   one-dimensional search algorithm. As an example application, the
   golden-section search method is used to find the optimal form of a

Abstract = {{The selection of placement and size for the multiple distributed
   generations (DGs) based on renewable energies becomes an important issue
   to operate modern power systems safely and reliably. This paper extends
   the previous study in {[}1] by treating the problems for their optimal
   locations and sizes in more realistic way based on the power loss
   sensitivities and Kalman filter algorithm, respectively. In particular,
   the proposed method is implemented by the simulation on a part of
   practical distribution network of 60 MVA-scale, which is located at the
   Do-gok area in Seoul, Korea. The new factor, called as the optimal
   locator index (OLI), is developed to determine the optimal locations in
   a systematic and effective manner by the power loss sensitivities. Also,
   the Kalman filter algorithm is applied to determine the optimal sizes by
   choosing the step size of 10 KW, which is much smaller increment than
   the 10 MW step used in {[}1], without requiring high computational
   efforts. This selected step size of 10 KW is realistic and suitable to
   apply it for the practical test system.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control can be computationally intensive as it has to
   compute an optimal control trajectory at each time instant. As such, we
   present a method in which parametrized behaviors are introduced as a
   level of abstraction to give a finite representation to the control
   trajectory optimization. As these control laws can be designed to
   accomplish different tasks, the robot is able to use the presented
   framework to tune the parameters online to achieve desirable results.
   Moreover, we build on switch-time optimization techniques to allow the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we connect local properties in a mobile planar
   multi-robot team to the task of creating decentralized real time
   algorithmic music. Using a nonlinear formation control law inspired by
   the consensus equation, we map the local motion parameters of robots to
   Euclidean rhythms with the use of sequencers. The control parameters
   allow a human user to direct this decentralized musical process by
   guiding and interfering with the robots' motion, which subsequently
   affects their musical activity. We simulate such a robotic system in
   real time, demonstrating the expressiveness of the decentralized
   algorithmic musical output as well as a number of behaviors that arise
   out of the manipulation of the control parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A gliding robotic fish is developed for promising applications in
   aquatic environment monitoring. The design concept combines the
   strengths of both underwater gliders and robotic fish, featuring long
   operation duration and high maneuverability. This paper presents both
   analytical and experimental results for the three-dimension spiraling
   motion, an essential working pattern of the gliding fish for detecting
   pollution in a water column. A dynamic model of the gliding robotic fish
   with actuated tail is established. Then the steady-state spiraling
   equations are derived and solved recursively using Newton's method. The
   gliding fish prototype is tested in experiments. Both model prediction
   and experimental results show that the spiraling motion has very low
   energy consumption, and the gliding fish can achieve high
   maneuverability with a turning radius less than 1 m, 2.5\% of the
   reported turning radius of a typical underwater glider.}},

Abstract = {{A class of path following and formation controllers are implemented on
   marine robots performing autonomous surveys in regions polluted by crude
   oil during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The controllers enable the
   robots to follow lines and curves, and maintain formation collectively
   while measuring reminiscent crude oil along their paths. The controllers
   are mathematically sound with proven convergence and robustness.
   However, their performance in the surveying missions is affected by
   natural disturbances caused by wind and water currents, and constraints
   such as sensor inaccuracy, localization errors, and network delays. This
   paper evaluates the performance of our controllers based on data
   collected during a survey performed at Grand Isle, Louisiana. These
   results will provide guidance for mission designs and inspire the future
   developments of our marine robots used to perform autonomous
   environmental surveys.}},

   utilizing factor graphs to produce an accurate online estimate of the
   trajectory of a mobile robotic platform. We also examine the advantages

   environment. Through several experiments in environments with varying
   sizes and construction we show that our method reduces rotational and

Abstract = {{The Robots for Humanity project aims to enable people with severe motor
   impairments to interact with their own bodies and their environment
   through the use of an assistive mobile manipulator, thereby improving
   their quality of life. Assistive mobile manipulators (AMMs) are mobile
   robots that physically manipulate the world in order to provide
   assistance to people with disabilities. They present an exciting
   frontier for assistive technology, as they can operate away from the
   user, have a large dexterous workspace (due to their mobility), and not
   directly encumber their users. The cornerstone of this project is an
   ongoing, interactive design process with a quadriplegic user, Henry
   Evans, and his wife and primary caregiver, Jane Evans. Henry has been
   enabled, through the use of a PR2 robot, to scratch his own face, shave,
   fetch a towel from his kitchen, and hand out Halloween candy to
   trick-or-treating children at a local mall.}},

Abstract = {{We present a cross-language knowledge integration framework to improve
   the performance in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Two
   types of knowledge sources, manner attribute and prosodic structure, are
   incorporated. For manner of articulation, cross-lingual attribute
   detectors trained with an American English corpus (WSJ0) are utilized to
   verify and rescore hypothesized Mandarin syllables in word lattices
   obtained with state-of-the-art systems. For the prosodic structure,
   models trained with an unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling
   technique using a Mandarin corpus (TCC300) are used in lattice
   rescoring. Experimental results on Mandarin syllable, character and word
   recognition with the TCC300 corpus show that the proposed approach
   significantly outperforms the baseline system that does not use
   articulatory and prosodic information. It also demonstrates a potential
   of utilizing results from cross-lingual attribute detectors as a
   language-universal frontend for automatic speech recognition.}},

Abstract = {{The n-point correlation functions (npcf) are powerful statistics that
   are widely used for data analyses in astronomy and other fields. These
   statistics have played a crucial role in fundamental physical
   breakthroughs, including the discovery of dark energy. Unfortunately,
   directly computing the npcf at a single value requires O (N-n) time for
   N points and values of n of 2, 3, 4, or even larger. Astronomical data
   sets can contain billions of points, and the next generation of surveys
   will generate terabytes of data per night. To meet these computational
   demands, we present a highly-tuned npcf computation code that show an
   order-of-magnitude speedup over current state-of-theart. This enables a
   much larger 3-point correlation computation on the galaxy distribution
   than was previously possible. We show a detailed performance evaluation
   on many different architectures.}},

   counterelectrodes. The TiO2 nanowire arrays are grown on the optical
   fiber using liquid phase deposition method and platinum is coated on the
   inwall of stainless steel capillary tubes using electroless deposition.
   The 3D DSSC is made by sheathering the tube on the fiber structure. In
   comparison to planar illumination geometry, the efficiency for the 3D
   structure has been enhanced by a factor of 3.6. An absolute efficiency
   of 6\% has been demonstrated at an optimal length of TiO2 NWs (12 mu m).
   This study demonstrates a new methodology for building flexible and
   high-efficient fiber based 3D solar cells that can be expanded to
   concentrating solar cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   a focus on its real time control and tracking algorithms. The EnerCage
   is meant to be used in long-term uninterrupted electrophysiology

   inductive power transmission, an array of 3-D magnetic sensors for
   non-line-of-sight positioning of the animal subject, and a mobile unit
   to efficiently power the target device and establish wireless data
   communication. The stationary unit, which includes a scalable array of
   overlapping hexagonal coils, takes advantage of 3- and 4-coil links to
   further increase the power transmission efficiency (PTE) and decrease
   the required number of drivers. A magnetic tracking algorithm is
   presented that reduces the number of magnetic sensors needed for
   localization. The algorithm achieves a worst-case localization error of
   3 cm at the nominal height of 12 cm above the surface of the coil array.

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new technique, called pulse delay modulation
   (PDM), for wideband data transmission across inductive links along with
   the power carrier. It consumes small power, provides robustness against
   strong power carrier interference, and does not affect the power
   transfer efficiency (PTE). In PDM, a pattern of narrow pulses are
   transmitted at precise time delays for each data bit through an
   inductive link to initiate a short oscillatory pattern across the
   receiver (Rx) data coil. This oscillation shifts the zero-crossings of
   the undesired sinusoidal power carrier interference on the Rx data coil,
   resulting in a phase shift between the Rx power and data signals, from
   which the data bit stream can be recovered. We describe the PDM
   theoretical foundation and demonstrate its operation via post-layout
   simulation of a PDM transceiver, designed in a 0.35-mu m standard CMOS
   process, using a realistic inductive link model. The PDM transceiver is
   expected to achieve a data rate of 13.56 Mbps at 1 cm data coils
   separation with up to 2 mm misalignment while delivering >250 mW through
   an orthogonal power transmission link to an implantable medical device.}},

Abstract = {{Battery-powered electronics rely on integration and power efficiency for
   size and operational life. Switched-inductor converters play a critical
   role in this because most portable systems depend on dc-dc converters to
   supply power efficiently. Understanding the collective impact of
   shrinking dimensions on total power losses in a switching converter is
   therefore important when selecting a process technology for the
   power-supply chip, because the optimal choice results in longer battery
   life. This paper analyzes and validates the effects of finer CMOS
   technologies (which feature shorter minimum channel lengths L-MIN,
   higher oxide capacitance, and lower breakdown voltages) on the
   efficiency performance of switched-inductor dc-dc converters in
   continuous-and discontinuous-conduction modes (CCM and DCM). Simulation
   results show that conduction and gate-drive losses in switches rise with
   L-MIN(1.5) and bias and bandwidth-critical quiescent losses with L-MIN
   and L-MIN(3), respectively. In other words, because parasitic components
   and gate-drive voltages rise with L-MIN, efficiency drops with coarser
   technologies: E.g., the efficiencies of optimized 0.18-, 0.35-, and
   0.5-mu m buck converters peaked at 93\%, 89\%, and 79\%.}},

   electrical damping force in the transducer is therefore as important as
   lowering power losses in the circuit. In kinetic electrostatic
   harvesters, raising the voltage across the moving parallel plates
   increases this force, which is what the energy-harvesting 0.35-mu m CMOS
   charger proposed achieves with a 10-nF capacitor C-CLAMP. The system
   presented harnesses fifteen times (15x) more energy at 16 V (with 15
   nJ/Cycle) than at 4 V (with 1 nJ/Cycle) from 50 - 250-pF, 60-Hz

Abstract = {{A network has several attributes which play a role in determining the
   security of the network and its robustness to external threats. These
   attributes are related to security through a complex nonlinear function
   which is generally unknown to the network management personnel. Since
   the network security is an explicit function of these attributes, the
   managers do not realize when the value of a certain attribute has become
   critical to the point of threatening network security. In this paper we
   take a theoretically rigorous approach to quantifying the effect each of
   the individual attributes has on the network. By using ideas from
   probability and decision theory, we can order the significant factors
   determining network security. This is similar to dimensionality
   reduction which is commonly employed for model based identification
   methods. Based on our analysis we can come up with critical coefficients
   which must be maintained by the administrator if the network is to
   remain secure to external threats. We show how the mathematical
   framework leads to the prediction of network's security health, and how
   real world data can be used to substantiate these claims. Paper
   concludes by validating our results on a list of compromised machine and
   determining if our identified metrics played the significant role in the
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Network Disaster Recovery research has examined behavior of networks
   after disasters with an aim to restoring normal conditions. In addition
   to probable loss of connectivity, a disaster scenario can also lead to
   security risks. However, network security has been examined extensively
   under normal conditions, and not under conditions that ensue after
   disasters. Therefore, security issues should be addressed during the
   period of chaos after a disaster, but before operating conditions return
   to normal. Furthermore, security should be assured, while still allowing
   access to the network to enable public communication in order to assist
   in disaster relief efforts. In general, the desire to help with public
   assistance requires opening up access to the network, while security
   concerns add pressure to close down or limit access to the network. In
   this study, we show that the objectives of availability and
   confidentiality, two objectives that have not previously been considered
   together in disaster scenarios, can be simultaneously achieved. For our
   study, we evaluated six wireless devices with various network
   configurations, including a laptop, a Kindle Fire e-reader, an Android
   tablet, a Google Nexus phone, an IP camera, and an Apple TV, to
   approximate behaviors of a communication network under a disaster
   scenario. Actual data leakage was tracked and observed for these

   illustrating the data leakage of various devices, we analyze the risk
   associated with the various types of leakage. Moving private traffic to
   a VPN would free the physical network for use as a public resource.}},

Abstract = {{Gate holding reduces congestion by reducing the number of aircraft
   present on the airport surface at any time, while not starving the
   runway. Because some departing flights are held at gates, there is a
   possibility that arriving flights cannot access the gates and have to
   wait until the gates are cleared. This is called a gate conflict. Robust
   gate assignment is an assignment that minimizes gate conflicts by
   assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time gap between two
   consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment robust,
   but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to simulate
   the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The model
   is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia
   Airport (LGA). Then, the model simulates the airport departure process
   with the original gate assignment and a robust gate assignment to assess
   the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The
   results show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate
   conflicts caused by gate holding compared to the original gate
   assignment. Therefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with
   gate-holding departure control to improve operations at congested
   airports with limited gate resources.}},

Abstract = {{The resonant characteristics of rectangular microcantilevers vibrating
   in the torsional mode in viscous liquid media are investigated. The
   hydrodynamic load (torque per unit length) on the vibrating beam due to
   the liquid was first determined using a finite element model. An
   analytical expression of the hydrodynamic function in terms of the
   Reynolds number and aspect ratio, h/b (with thickness, h, and width, b)
   was then obtained by fitting the numerical results. This allowed for the
   resonance frequency and quality factor to be investigated as functions
   of both beam geometry and medium properties. Moreover, the effects of
   the aspect ratio on the cross-section's torsional constant, K, which
   affects the microcantilever's torsional stiffness, and on its polar
   moment of inertia, J(p), which is associated with the beam's rotational
   inertia, are also considered when obtaining the resonance frequency and
   quality factor. Compared with microcantilevers under out-of-plane
   (transverse) flexural vibration, the results show that microcantilevers
   that vibrate in their 1st torsional or 1st in-plane (lateral) flexural
   resonant modes have higher resonance frequency and quality factor. The
   increase in resonance frequency and quality factor results in higher
   mass sensitivity and reduced frequency noise, respectively. The
   improvement in the sensitivity and quality factor are expected to yield
   much lower limits of detection in liquid-phase chemical sensing
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Thin film bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators have been the subject of
   research for many years due to their uses in wireless communications and
   chemical sensing. Both the steady-state and dynamic temperature
   characteristics of quartz resonators, such as those used in bio-sensing,
   have been studied in the past. Information pertaining to the
   steady-state temperature characteristics of ZnO BAW resonators is
   available in the literature, but thermal transient characteristics do
   not appear to be the subject of as much investigation. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the existence of transient thermal effects in ZnO
   solidly-mounted resonators (SMR). Resonators are exposed to a gradual
   and rapid temperature increase and the changes in five resonator
   parameters are compared. All five parameters are shown to vary linearly
   with temperature when exposed to a gradual temperature increase and vary
   in a parabolic manner when exposed to a rapid temperature increase,
   indicating the existence of thermal transient effects in these devices.}},

   notch is a result of charge cancellation across the output electrodes,
   which is a direct consequence of exciting higher order lateral modes
   with a displacement profile out-of-phase with the primary modes of the
   filter. We show multiple filters with a passband notch and demonstrate
   the viability of using top electrode layout to adjust the placement of
   the notch within the filter passband. A modified equivalent circuit is
   used to intuitively explain the response of a bandpass filter with an
   integrated notch. Such filters can have applications as pre-select
   bandpass filters capable of rejecting in-band interfering signals.}},

   is studied for two types of contacts: top and side contacts. Although
   virtually all experiments on multi-layer graphene use top contacts that
   couple only to the top layer, the analytical models available consider
   side contacts that couple to all the layers. It is shown that for side
   contacts, the frequency response improves continuously with number of
   layers, unlike the top contacts, which show very little improvement
   beyond a few layers. The delay and energy-delay-product obtained from
   the frequency response are minimized at some optimal number of layers,

Abstract = {{Matrix lower rank approximations such as non-negative matrix
   factorization (NMF) have been successfully used to solve many data
   mining tasks. In this paper, we propose a new matrix lower rank
   approximation called Bounded Matrix Low Rank Approximation (BMA) which
   imposes a lower and an upper bound on every element of a lower rank
   matrix that best approximates a given matrix with missing elements. This
   new approximation models many real world problems, such as recommender
   systems, and performs better than other methods, such as singular value
   decompositions (SVD) or NMF. We present an efficient algorithm to solve
   BMA based on coordinate descent method. BMA is different from NMF as it
   imposes bounds on the approximation itself rather than on each of the
   low rank factors. We show that our algorithm is scalable for large
   matrices with missing elements on multi core systems with low memory. We
   present substantial experimental results illustrating that the proposed
   method outperforms the state of the art algorithms for recommender
   systems such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Alternating Least Squares
   with regularization, SVD++, Bias-SVD on real world data sets such as
   Jester, Movielens, Book crossing, Online dating and Netflix.}},

   TSV-induced thermal mechanical stress further exacerbate the EM issue
   compared to 2D ICs. In this paper, we analyze the root causes of EM for
   3D IC signal nets, with consideration of current density, temperature,
   and TSV-induced thermal mechanical stress. We develop compact EM models
   for both DC and AC signal nets using detailed finite-element-analysis
   (FEA) and build EM library for mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). For AC
   signal nets, we convert AC current into equivalent DC current and model
   EM with it. One unique property of EM in 3D ICs is that, depending on
   the current direction, TSV-induced stress may degrade or improve the
   MTTF, thus routing plays an important role for EM mitigation. We suggest
   EM-aware routing algorithms for 3D ICs for the first time to our best
   knowledge, guided by our stress-aware EM modeling. Experimental result
   shows that our proposed approach improves EM-robustness of 3D IC
   benchmarks significantly, e. g., 66.4\% less EM-violated grids with
   little sacrifice of conventional routing objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the use of scaled technologies, high levels of integration and
   high speeds of today's mixed-signal SoCs, the problem of validating
   correct operation of the SoC under electrical bugs and that of debugging
   yield loss due to unmodeled multi-dimensional variability effects is
   extremely challenging. Precise simulation of all electrical aspects of
   the design including the interfaces between digital and analog
   circuitry, coupling across power and ground planes, crosstalk, etc.,
   across all process corners is very hard to achieve in a practical sense.
   The problem is expected to get worse as analog/mixed-signal/RF devices
   scale beyond the 45nm node and are more tightly integrated with digital
   systems than at present. In this context, a post-silicon validation
   methodology for analog/mixed-signal/RF SoCs is proposed that relies on
   the use of special stimulus designed to expose differences between
   observed DUT behavior and its predictive model. The corresponding error
   signature is then used to identify the likely ``type{''} of electrical
   bug and its location in the design using nonlinear optimization
   algorithms. Results of trial experiments on RF devices are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-GHz arbitrary timing generator (ATG) design is described and
   demonstrated in a hardware prototype. The objective of the ATG is to
   realize ATE hardware that nearly matches the unlimited timing
   flexibility of software simulation tools. The ATG allows timing edges to
   be programmed at almost any desired point within the test, with minimal
   constraints. The delay of every edge can be changed on a cycle-to-cycle
   basis. The period (frequency) can be changed on a bit-by-bit basis.
   Real-time algorithmic calculation of timing values is accomplished using
   a pipelined FPGA controller so that highly complex timing sequences can
   be synthesized. The ATG generates timing edges according to the FPGA
   calculations, and combines these with serialized digital ``pattern{''}
   data to create the desired signal waveforms. A prototype supports
   similar to 10ps resolution and achieves approximately +/-20ps accuracy
   (including 6 sigma random jitter). Its maximum sustainable data rate is
   3.2Gbps (non-multiplexed) and 6.4Gbps (multiplexed). Bursts patterns up
   to 10.0Gbps are also demonstrated. Minimum pulse-width is similar to
   70ps.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-bond testing of TSVs and die logic is a significant challenge and a
   potential roadblock for 3D integration. BIST solutions introduce
   considerable die area overhead. Oversized probe pads on TSVs to provide
   pre-bond test access limit both test bandwidth and TSV density. This
   paper presents a solution to these problems, allowing a probe card to
   contact TSVs without the need for probe pads, enabling both TSV and
   pre-bond scan test. Two possible pre-bond scan test configurations are
   shown-they provide varying degrees of test parallelism. HSPICE
   simulations are performed on a logic-on-logic 3D benchmark. Results show
   that the ratio of the number of probe needles available for test access
   to the number of pre-bond scan chains determines which pre-bond scan
   configuration results in the shortest test time. Maximum pre-bond
   scan-in and scan-out shift-clock speeds are determined for dies in a
   benchmark 3D design. These clock speeds show that pre-bond scan test can
   be performed quickly, at a speed that is comparable to scan testing of
   packaged dies. The maximum clock speed can also be tuned by changing the
   drive strength of the probe and on-die drivers of the TSV network.
   Estimates are also provided for peak and average power consumption
   during pre-bond scan test. On-die area overhead for the proposed method
   is estimated to be between 1.0\% and 2.2\% for three dies in the 3D
   stack.}},

   the use of 3D frequency selective surfaces which are used both for

   The core allows for an embedded power source, processor, amplifier,

Abstract = {{The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)-Enabled Sensing Testbed
   (R.E.S.T.) is a flexible platform for developing RFID technologies
   (sensors, RF front ends, coding, etc.) across frequency bands from
   low-frequency through microwave and millimeter. Paired with a USRP N-200
   software defined radio, the R.E.S.T. allows researchers to streamline
   RFID product development or experiment with new sensing techniques/RF
   architectures without the need for rebuilding an entire RFID tag.
   Instead, interchangeable daughterboards can be swapped with minimal code
   modification. This paper will present an overview of the R.E.S.T..
   platform; its usefulness as a research, teaching, and development tool;
   and some sample applications which have used the R.E.S.T. platform to
   date, including the development of a 5.8 GHz RFID backscatter radio

Abstract = {{An overview of alternatives to vapor-compression heat pumps, driven by
   the near-to-long term phase-out of conventional refrigerants, is
   provided in this paper, followed by a discussion of advances in
   microscale heat and mass transfer that are leading to the development of
   a new generation of modular, versatile, small-capacity sorption heat
   pumps. It is pointed out that absorption, which has been a mature
   technology for over a century at the large capacities, can also be
   applied at the smaller scales, in residential and commercial
   installations in small envelopes through the use of these innovations in
   microscale heat and mass exchange. Ammonia-water is the working fluid of
   choice for such compact installations due to its favorable thermodynamic
   and transport properties, especially the low freezing point and low
   specific volume of ammonia compared to water vapor. Both falling-film
   and internal forced-convective flow configurations are presented as
   viable options for compact absorption systems. Compactness and
   integration of multiple functions into single components also yields
   considerable reduction in fluid inventory requirements, connecting
   plumbing, shipping and installation of these units. Applications include
   air-conditioning, space heating, and water heating, driven by natural
   gas, waste heat from collocated processes, and solar thermal energy.
   Standalone units as well as modular thermal hubs distributed around
   buildings are facilitated by the availability of these compact heat
   pumps. The progress in component design, fabrication, controls, and
   system integration required to take these preliminary demonstration
   units to full-fledged commercial systems and present viable options to
   the dominant vapor-compression systems is also discussed.}},

Title = {{Temporal Stability of Freeway Macroscopic Traffic Stream Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2315}},
Pages = {{131-140}},
Abstract = {{A key assumption for the successful deployment of mesoscopic
   transportation network simulation to assess network behavior and
   performance at a future planning horizon is that the parameters of the
   constituent macroscopic traffic stream models remain stable at
   relatively long planning time scales. However, no research has been
   undertaken to test this assumption systematically. Assessing the
   validity of this implicit assumption requires rigorous analysis based on
   empirical traffic data covering a long period. Extensive freeway
   management systems have now been in place long enough to provide these
   empirical data. A method to investigate the issue of temporal stability
   of freeway macroscopic traffic stream models rigorously with 15 years of
   traffic data from the London Orbital Motorway is presented and
   implemented. Two forms of macroscopic traffic stream models, namely, a
   two-regime and a three-regime model form, were studied in this research.
   With a 13-week, outlier-corrected moving window sampling method and
   maximum likelihood parameter estimation, time series were developed for
   the model parameters. The temporal stability characteristics and
   correlation properties of the fitted parameters are analyzed and
   discussed. The parameters were found to be relatively stable over time
   and did not exhibit statistically significant seasonal correlation.
   Parameter variability was found to be governed primarily by the relative
   scatter of heavily congested observations and how well the heavily
   congested regime was represented in the individual data samples.
   Therefore, modelers should ensure that traffic stream model calibration
   data sets are free from outliers and well distributed across the model
   regimes.}},

   Measurements show that tags printed on veneer and embedded inside 2 mm

Abstract = {{A conducting body's Discrete Spectrum of Relaxation Frequencies (DSRF)
   is a valuable classifying characteristic that is used in the detection
   and discrimination of buried objects. In physical terms, the DSRF
   depicts the decay of eddy currents in a conducting body that is exposed
   to a time-varying magnetic field. An object's DSRF can only be computed
   analytically for a few canonical cases. Numerical computations for
   bodies of revolution (BOR) have been presented using boundary-element
   and finite-element techniques, but these techniques are complex. In this
   work, a simpler approach based on eigenvalue decomposition is presented
   that is capable of computing the DSRF for a class of BORs. Approved for
   public release, distribution unlimited.}},

Abstract = {{The EMI response of a target can be accurately modeled by a sum of
   relaxations. However, it is difficult to obtain the model parameters
   from measurements when the number of relaxations is unknown. We have
   previously proposed estimation methods for the model parameters from
   single measurements. In this paper, we exploit the invariance property
   of the relaxation frequencies and propose to obtain more accurate
   estimates using multiple measurements that are often available. This is
   accomplished by casting the modeling problem into a jointly-sparse
   vector recovery problem. The proposed method is shown to deliver robust
   estimation using synthetic, laboratory data, and field data.}},

Abstract = {{The Cumulative SUM (CUSUM) chart is a general method in statistical
   control engineering to Monitor controlled variables. By comparing the
   cumulated error between the process variable and the set point with
   predefined criteria, it is able to detect faults in the system that lead
   to a small but consistent deviation from the set point. CUSUM chart has
   been applied to VAV terminal units by NIST for fault detection, known as
   VAV Box Performance Assessment Control Charts (VPACC) method. This paper
   develops a causal network based method, which can extend the
   functionality of the CUSUM method to fault diagnostics, and tests it on
   the whole secondary systems (including air handling units and terminal
   units). To use this method, the user needs to specify the causal
   relationship between all the control variables, and all the physical
   components that are part of the control loop for each variable. Based on
   the input, an automatic fault diagnostics algorithm could be applied
   that determines the possible faulty components in the system. It is
   realized that the CUSUM method can only detect faults that will lead to
   control problems, therefore the capability of this method is limited.
   But the CUSUM method has a strong advantage over other methods, it
   requires only building control related sensor information, which are the
   sensors in any building automation control system, and it can be easily
   adapted if the system is changed or upgraded, which frequently happens
   in renovations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a color segmentation approach based on a two-dimensional
   color map derived from the input image. Pathologists stain tissue
   biopsies with various colored dyes to see the expression of biomarkers.
   In these images, because of color variation due to inconsistencies in
   experimental procedures and lighting conditions, the segmentation used
   to analyze biological features is usually ad-hoc. Many algorithms like
   K-means use a single metric to segment the image into different color
   classes and rarely provide users with powerful color control. Our 2D
   color map interactive segmentation technique based on human color
   perception information and the color distribution of the input image,
   enables user control without noticeable delay. Our methodology works for
   different staining types and different types of cancer tissue images.
   Our proposed method's results show good accuracy with low response and
   computational time making it a feasible method for user interactive
   applications involving segmentation of histological images.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean models that are able to provide accurate and real-time prediction
   of tidal current will improve the performance of glider navigation. In
   this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute a model for tidal
   current at higher resolution than existing approaches. By focusing on a
   small area and incorporating measurements from multiple gliders, we are
   able to perform real-time computation of the model, which is desired by
   operations of underwater gliders in the ocean. Our model uses a lower
   resolution, larger scale model to initialize the computation. We have
   also demonstrated incorporating data streams from other observation
   systems such as WavE RAdar (WERA) system. Glider navigation performance
   using the proposed tidal model is demonstrated in a simulated tidal
   field based on data collected off the coast of Georgia. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{We propose a control method for exercising specific muscles of a human's
   lower body. This is accomplished through the use of an exoskeleton that
   imposes active force feedback control. The proposed method involves a
   combined dynamic model of the musculoskeletal system of the lower-body
   with the dynamics of pneumatic actuators. The exoskeleton is designed to
   allow for individual control of mono-articular or bi-articular muscles
   to be exercised while not inhibiting the subject's range of motion.
   The control method has been implemented in a 1-Degree of Freedom (DOF)
   exoskeleton that is designed to resist the motion of the human knee by
   applying actuator forces in opposition to a specified muscle force
   profile. In this paper, we discuss the model of the human's lower body
   and how muscles are affected as a function of joint positions. We then
   discuss the forces needed by a pneumatic actuator to oppose the muscles
   to create the desired muscle force profile at a given joint angles. The
   proposed exoskeleton could be utilized either for rehabilitation
   purposes, to prevent muscle atrophy and bone loss of astronauts, or for
   muscle training in general.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication is an expanding body of research. Recent
   advances in biology have encouraged using genetically engineered
   bacteria as the main component in the molecular communication. This has
   stimulated a new line of research that attempts to study molecular
   communication among bacteria from an information-theoretic point of
   view. Due to high randomness in the individual behavior of the
   bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria is almost
   impossible. Therefore, we recently proposed that a population of
   bacteria in a cluster is considered as a node capable of molecular
   transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a
   reliable node out of many unreliable bacteria. The bacteria inside a
   node sense the environment and respond accordingly. In this paper, we
   study the communication between two nodes, one acting as the transmitter
   and the other as the receiver. We consider the case in which the
   information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the
   transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter
   node propagate in the environment via the diffusion process. Then, their
   concentration sensed by the bacteria in the receiver node would decode
   the information. The randomness in the communication is caused by both
   the error in the molecular production at the transmitter and the
   reception of molecules at the receiver. We study the theoretical limits
   of the information transfer rate in such a setup versus the number of
   bacteria per node. Finally, we consider M-ary modulation schemes and
   study the achievable rates and their error probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze an attack scenario for the simple substitution
   cipher using the wiretap channel model, where the attacker only has
   access to error-prone ciphertext at the output of a packet erasure
   channel (PEC). Each packet is comprised of exactly one symbol of
   ciphertext, and hence, the attacker's channel could be viewed as a
   symbol erasure channel. Information-theoretic cryptanalysis provides key
   and message equivocations for the cipher in general, and then gives the
   results as functions of the error-free ciphertext equivocations. The
   findings characterize the increase in equivocation that might be
   expected if encrypted data were further encoded using wiretap codes that
   introduce symbol erasures to passive eavesdroppers.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of a state space for systems with time variant delay is
   analyzed. We show that under causality and consistency constraints a
   state space can be derived, but fails if the conditions are not
   satisfied. We rederive a known result on spectral reachability using an
   discretization approach followed by taking limits. It is also shown that
   when a system with fixed delay is modeled as one in a class with larger
   delay, reachability can no longer be preserved. This has repercussions
   in modeling systems with bounded time varying delay by embedding them in
   the class of delay systems with fixed delay, equal to the maximum of the
   delay function tau(t), or by using lossless causalization.}},

Title = {{Pavement Preservation with Micromilling in Georgia Follow-Up Study}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2292}},
Pages = {{81-87}},
Abstract = {{The micromilling technique to mill asphalt surface mix continues to be
   studied in the state of Georgia as part of a pavement preservation
   treatment in conjunction with thin asphalt overlays. Earlier research
   showed the results of micromilling on a deteriorated open-graded
   surface, which was overlaid with a new open-graded surface on 1-75,
   south of Macon, Georgia. The micromilling produced a much finer surface
   texture than did conventional milling, with a ridge-to-valley depth
   (RVD) of less than 3 mm, and the technique could more accurately mill
   the deteriorated open-graded layer. A new open-graded surface was placed
   on top of that layer with no need for a new dense- or gap-graded layer.
   The result was a large cost savings compared with conventional milling
   and overlay. This paper summarizes research performed on a micromilling
   and open-graded inlay project on 1-95 near Savannah, Georgia, and
   compares the results with those from the previous research. The new
   research affirms that significant cost savings can be achieved through
   the replacement of conventional milling with micromilling. Results
   obtained from the 1-75 project indicated that, on the basis of 3 years
   of satisfactory performance of the open-graded overlay on the
   micromilled surface, the use of the 95th percentile RVD parameter as the
   threshold value for compliance with the 3.2-mm RVD acceptance
   requirement could be too conservative. Results from the 1-95 project
   indicated that the mean RVD of the micromilled surface could meet the
   3.2-mm RVD requirement. However, the appropriateness of this parameter's
   use should be determined on the basis of the long-term performance of
   the open-graded mix placed on the micromilled surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports scientifically meaningful in vivo experiments using a
   32-channel wireless neural recording system (WINeR). The WINeR system is
   divided into transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) parts. On the Tx side,
   we had WINeR-6, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that operated based on time
   division multiplexing (TDM) of pulse width modulated (PWM) samples. The
   chip was fabricated in a 0.5-mu m CMOS process, occupying 4.9 x 3.3
   mm(2) and consuming 15 mW from +/- 1.5V supplies. The Rx used two
   antennas with separate pathways to down-convert the RF signal from a
   large area. A time-to-digital converter (TDC) in an FPGA converted the
   PWM pulses into digitized samples. In order to further increase the
   wireless coverage area and eliminate blind spots within a large
   experimental arena, two receivers were synchronized. The WINeR system
   was used to record epileptic activities from a rat that was injected
   with tetanus toxin (TT) in the dorsal hippocampus. In a different in
   vivo experiment, place-specific firing fields of place cells, which are
   parts of the hippocampal-dependent memory, were mapped from a series of
   behavioral experiments from a rat running in a circular track. Results
   from the same animal were compared against a commercial hard-wired
   recording system to evaluate the quality of the wireless recordings.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer through inductive coupling is used in many
   applications such as high performance implantable microelectronic
   devices (IMDs). Power transfer efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to
   the load (PDL) are two conventional inductive link design merits that
   determine the energy source and driver specifications, heat dissipation,
   power transmission range, and risk of interference with other devices.
   Unfortunately designing the inductive link to achieve a high PTE will
   drastically reduce the PDL and vice versa. Therefore, we are proposing a
   new figure-of-merit (FoM), which includes both PTE and PDL with proper
   weights, to help designers of inductive power transfer links to strike a
   balance between high PTE and PDL at the same time. Three design examples
   based on the PTE, PDL, and the new FoM have been presented for IMDs to
   demonstrate the usage and efficacy of the FoM. Our measurement results
   show that the inductive link optimized based on the FoM can achieved
   1.65 times higher PTE than the one optimized for the PDL (72.5\% vs.
   44\%) and at the same time provide 20.8 times larger PDL compared to the
   one optimized for the PTE (177 mW vs. 8.5 mW for 1 V driving voltage).
   The inductive links optimized for the PTE and PDL provide 24\% higher
   PTE and PDL compared to the one optimized based on the FoM,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic localization has been used in a variety of applications,
   including the medical field. Small magnetic tracers are often modeled as
   dipoles and localization has been achieved by solving well-defined
   dipole equations. However, in practice, the precise calculation of the
   tracer location not only depends on solving the highly nonlinear dipole
   equations through numerical algorithms but also on the precision of the
   magnetic sensor, accuracy of the tracer magnetization, and the earth
   magnetic field (EMF) measurements. We have developed and implemented a
   comprehensive calibration method that addresses all of the
   aforementioned factors. We evaluated this method in a bench-top setting
   by moving the tracer along controlled trajectories. We also conducted
   several experiments to track the tongue movement in a human subject.}},

Abstract = {{Sickle cell disease, the most common hemoglobin disorder, affects major
   organ systems with symptoms of pain, anemia and a multitude of chronic
   conditions. For adolescents, the disease adversely affects school
   attendance, academic progress and social activity. To effectively study
   the relationship among school attendance and other factors like
   demographics and academic performance, studies have relied on
   self-reporting and school records, all of which have some bias. In this
   study we design and prototype a system, called SickleSAM (Sickle cell
   School attendance and Activity Monitoring system), for automatically
   monitoring school attendance and daily activity of adolescents with
   sickle cell disease. SickleSAM intends to remove human bias and
   inaccuracies. The system uses built-in GPS to collect data which will be
   recorded into a cloud database using Short Messaging Service technology.
   SickleSAM is developed by Georgia Institute of Technology in conjunction
   with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA). System effectiveness is
   being evaluated using a trial of 10 adolescents with the disease.}},

Abstract = {{An intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter that can provide forward
   viewing volumetric ultrasound images would be an invaluable clinical
   tool for guiding interventions. Single chip integration of front-end
   electronics with capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs)
   is highly desirable to reduce the interconnection complexity and enable
   miniaturization in IVUS catheters. For this purpose we use the
   monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS integration where CMUTs are fabricated directly
   on top of pre-processed CMOS wafers. This minimizes parasitic
   capacitances associated with connection lines. We have recently
   implemented a system design including all the required electronics using
   0.35-mu m CMOS process integrated with a 1.4-mm diameter CMUT array. In
   this study, we present the experimental volumetric imaging results from
   an ex-vivo chicken heart phantom. The imaging results demonstrate that
   the single-chip forward looking IVUS (FL-IVUS) system with
   monolithically integrated electronics has potential to visualize the
   front view of coronary arteries.}},

   touch on the iPhone screen with index finger, a computer mouse on
   iPhone, and TDS-iPhone Bluetooth mouse interface with tongue motion.
   Preliminary results show that the average completion times of a scenario

Abstract = {{A semi-automated method for analyzing cardiac quiescence of anatomical
   cardiac features from two-dimensional echocardiographic cine data is
   presented. The method utilizes both active contour and optical flow
   techniques for feature identification and tracking. A curvature-based
   potential surface was used in the active contour calculations to attract
   the contour to regions of inflection on the image surface rather than
   the standard gradient-based surface that attracts the contour to strong
   edges. After identifying the feature in each frame, the frame-to-frame
   correlation matrix of the feature was calculated with correlation values
   corresponding to how well the feature matched between frames. Therefore
   prolonged regions of high correlation correspond to periods of cardiac
   quiescence. The location and duration of these periods were
   automatically identified from the correlation matrix by finding the
   largest region around each time index with a mean correlation above a
   specified threshold. In parallel, the position of the feature was
   calculated for each frame by finding the centroid of the pixel locations
   inside the contour. From this trajectory, the magnitude of the
   two-dimensional velocity was calculated. These methods were used to
   analyze the quiescence of the interventricular septum from an apical
   four-chamber echocardiogram performed on a human subject.
   Correlation-derived quiescent phases were observed to coincide with
   periods of the cardiac cycle with minimal velocity magnitude.}},

   Results indicate that the normalization model closely fits empirical
   values for two renal tumor datasets. We study the effect of scale
   normalization on classification of renal tumor images. Scale
   normalization improves classification performance in most cases.
   However, performance decreases in a few cases. In order to understand
   this, we propose two methods to filter extracted image features that are

Abstract = {{Modern imaging technology permits obtaining images at varying depths
   along the thickness, or the Z-axis of the sample being imaged. A stack
   of multiple such images is called a Z-stack image. The focus capability
   offered by Z-stack images is critical for many digital pathology
   applications. A single Z-stack image may result in several hundred
   gigabytes of data, and needs to be compressed for archival and
   distribution purposes. Currently, the existing methods for compression
   of Z-stack images such as JPEG and JPEG 2000 compress each focal plane
   independently, and do not take advantage of the Z-signal redundancy. It
   is possible to achieve additional compression efficiency over the
   existing methods, by exploiting the high Z-signal correlation during
   image compression. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for
   compression of Z-stack images, which we term as ZPEG. ZPEG extends the
   popular discrete-cosine transform (DCT) based image encoder to compress
   Z-stack images. This is achieved by decorrelating the neighboring layers
   of the Z-stack image using differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM).
   PSNR measurements, as well as subjective evaluations by experts indicate
   that ZPEG can encode Z-stack images at a higher quality as compared to
   JPEG, JPEG 2000 and JP3D at compression ratios below 50:1.}},

Abstract = {{An increased level of harmonics due to the proliferation of single-phase
   non-linear loads is raising serious concerns among utilities.
   Historically, passive filters have been proposed to reduce harmonics in
   MV utility applications. However, due to their limitations utilities are
   turning their attention to alternative solutions. At the same time,
   active filters are prohibitively expensive and are unlikely to become a
   realistic solution in the near future. In this paper a practical
   directional third harmonic hybrid active filter is proposed. A novel
   feature that adjusts the level of compensation provided by the filter
   based on the loading conditions of its passive components is introduced.
   Simulation and experimental results are presented. Issues related to
   utilizing existing VAr support capacitors for retrofit applications
   thereby achieving cost reduction and fail normal feature for increased
   reliability are addressed. Cost vs. performance curves are developed
   using factual utility harmonic data. Finally, the impact of a
   distributed filtering solution based on the proposed filter is shown
   using a simplified MV distribution system.}},

   1/4 cycle response to compete with existing power quality products by

   challenge of force commutating the static switch. Seamless islanding
   adds significant cost to microgrids, and to avoid adding unnecessary
   cost, the main value propositions for microgrids are analyzed.
   Requirements and characteristics are described for microgrids designed
   for each of the three value propositions: reliability, energy arbitrage,
   and power quality. Sample designs are compared for an example case,
   along with a discussion on the role of energy storage in microgrids.}},

Abstract = {{When inverters in voltage control mode are paired with synchronous
   generators they exhibit poor transient load sharing in islanded
   operation. The inverter initially picks up the majority of every load
   step, and the generator's output slowly increases until they reach their
   steady state load sharing given by droop settings. This excessive
   transient power output from the inverter constrains its rating compared
   to the largest anticipated load step, and could negatively impact
   battery life in battery energy storage inverters. This paper examines
   the transient load sharing characteristics between synchronous
   generators and inverters in voltage control, i.e.
   grid-supporting-grid-forming control, and investigates methods to
   improve it. An equivalent circuit is proposed to describe the initial
   power sharing ratio, and the effects of increased inverter droop slope
   and increased governor integral gain are investigated. An inverter
   control strategy of emulating a synchronous generator is shown to
   provide good transient load sharing. Validation is provided by
   simulation and experimental results for real and reactive loads.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the derivation and verification of a
   sinusoidal-steady-state equivalent-circuit model for microfabricated
   inductors developed for use in integrated power electronics. These
   inductors have a low profile, a toroidal air core, and a single-layer
   winding fabricated via high-aspect-ratio molding and electroplating.
   Such inductors inevitably have a significant gap between winding turns.
   This makes the equivalent resistance more difficult to model. The low
   profile increases the significance of energy stored in the winding
   which, together with the winding gap, makes the equivalent inductance
   more difficult to model as well. The models presented here account for
   these effects. Finally, the models are verified against results from 2D
   FEA, 3D FEA, direct measurement, and in-circuit experimentation. In all
   cases, the equivalent-circuit model is observed to be accurate to within
   several percent.}},

Abstract = {{Direct AC/AC topologies for AC-to-AC power conversion benefit from the
   absence of DC-link capacitors and therefore high reliability as compared
   to traditional VSI-based topologies. Moreover, it is shown in this paper
   that the direct AC/AC converters also promise to provide higher
   efficiency than their voltage source inverter (VSI) based back-to-back
   (BTB) counterparts due to a dramatic reduction in switching losses.
   These factors allow the direct AC/AC converter to switch faster, and
   maintain much smaller size and lower cost relative to their competition.
   This paper compares the performance of three different device types
   (SiC, hybrid Si/SiC and Si) for use in a direct AC/AC converter. It is
   conjectured that traditional datasheets lack the level of detail needed
   for designing highly efficient direct AC/AC converters. Therefore,
   comprehensive loss models for all the devices are formed through a
   rigorous device characterization under varying (V, I, T) operating
   conditions. Finally, a loss comparison is performed to identify the most
   suitable device (among those characterized) for a specific 13 kV / 1 MW
   highly efficient direct AC/AC power flow controller.}},

Abstract = {{Although direct ac/ac converters such as the Matrix converter have been
   in existence for a long time, scaling of these converters to higher
   voltage levels has not been addressed widely in the literature.
   Tremendous challenges in terms of device voltage sharing, safe
   commutation, and fault protection inhibit the application of these
   converters to high voltage applications such as dynamic grid control.
   The novel active snubber concept remedies this problem by placing a
   half-wave rectified envelope around every device, absorbing excess
   energy and ensuring proper voltage sharing. This paper examines a high
   frequency active snubber design for direct ac/ac converters. The
   performance of the snubber is analyzed at 13 kV / 1 MVA via simulations,
   and a proof-of-concept is implemented in a 10 kVA lab prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Control channel jamming is a severe security problem in wireless
   networks. This results from the fact that the attackers can effectively
   launch the denial of service attacks by jamming the control channels.
   Traditional approaches to combating this problem such as channel hopping
   sequences may not be the secure solution against intelligent attackers
   because the reliability of control channels in cognitive radio ad hoc
   networks cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we introduce a
   jamming-resilient control channel (JRCC) game to model the interactions
   among cognitive radio users and the attacker under the impact of primary
   user activity. We propose the JRCC algorithm that enables user
   cooperation to facilitate control channel allocations and adapts to
   primary user activity with variable learning rates using the
   Win-or-Learn-Fast principle for jamming-resilience in hostile
   environments. It is shown that the optimal strategies converge to a Nash
   equilibrium or the expected rewards of the strategies converge to that
   of a Nash equilibrium. The results also show that the JRCC algorithm
   effectively combats jamming under the impact of primary user activity
   and sensing errors. Moreover, the control channel allocation policy can
   be improved by enhancing transmission and sensing capabilities. The
   proposed algorithm is scalable and can be applied to multiple users.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular Communication (MC) is a bio-inspired paradigm where
   information is exchanged by the release, the propagation and the
   reception of molecules. The objective of this paper is to analyze the
   effects of interference in the most general type of MC system, i.e., the
   diffusion of molecules in a fluidic medium. The study of the InterSymbol
   Interference (ISI) and Co-Channel Interference (CCI) is conducted
   through the analysis of the propagation of signals in a diffusion-based
   channel. An in-depth analysis of the attenuation and the dispersion of
   signals due to molecule diffusion allows to derive simple closed-form
   formulas for both ISI and CCI. In this paper, two different modulation
   schemes, namely, the baseband modulation and the diffusion wave
   modulation are considered for the release of molecules in the
   diffusion-based MC and are compared in terms of interference. It is
   determined that the diffusion wave modulation scheme shows lower
   interference values than the baseband modulation scheme. Moreover, it is
   revealed that the higher is the frequency of the modulating diffusion
   wave, the lower are the effects of the ISI and the CCI on the
   communication channel. The obtained analytical results are compared and
   validated by numerical simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is enabling the development of integrated nano-devices
   which are able to perform only very simple tasks. Nanonetworks, i.e.,
   networks of nano-devices, will enable advanced applications of
   nanotechnology in the biomedical, environmental and military fields. One
   of the major bottlenecks in nanonetworks is posed by the very limited
   energy that can be stored in a nano-battery in contrast to the energy
   that is required by a nano-device to operate and, specially, to
   communicate. Recently, novel energy harvesting mechanisms have been
   proposed to replenish the energy stored in the nano-batteries. With
   these mechanisms, nanonetworks can overcome their energy bottleneck and
   even have infinite lifetime. In this paper, an energy model for
   self-powered nano-devices is developed that successfully captures the
   correlation between the energy harvesting and the energy consumption
   processes. The energy harvesting process is realized by means of a
   piezoelectric nano-generator, for which a new circuital model is
   developed which can accurately reproduce existing experimental data. The
   energy consumption process is due to the communication among
   nano-devices in the Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz). A mathematical
   framework is developed to obtain the probability distribution of the
   nano-device energy and to investigate the end-to-end successful packet
   delivery probability, the end-to-end packet delay, and the throughput in
   nanonetworks. Integrated nano-devices have not been built yet and, thus,
   the development of an analytical energy model is a fundamental step
   towards the design of architectures and protocols for nanonetworks.}},

Abstract = {{We tackle the problem of determining the beamforming and combining
   weights in a network of interfering multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) links. We classify any strategy for computing these weights as
   either unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral strategy is one for which
   the responsibility of cancelling interference from one node to another
   is preassigned to lie solely with only one of the two nodes, so that the
   other node is free to ignore the interference. Many existing strategies
   for managing interference in a network of MIMO nodes adopt the
   unilateral approach. In contrast, a bilateral strategy is one for which
   the responsibility of cancelling interference from one node to another
   is not preassigned, but is instead shared by both sides as the weights
   are computed. We present numerical examples to illustrate that bilateral
   strategies can significantly outperform unilateral strategies,
   especially for large networks and high interference. In one example, a
   bilateral approach delivers an aggregate capacity that is 227\% higher
   than that of the best unilateral approach. We conclude that, although
   unilateral strategies are useful for determining whether or not the
   streams allocated in a network of MIMO links can coexist, the weight
   computation should be done bilaterally to prevent throughput loss.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-enabled wireless communications set the Terahertz Band as the
   frequency band of operation of future nanodevices (0.1-10 THz). Amongst
   others, femtosecond-long pulse-based modulation schemes have been
   recently proposed to enable the communication among nanodevices. Within
   this context, a receiver architecture suitable for nanodevices must be
   ultra compact, must have high sensitivity and must be ultra-low power.
   Unfortunately, common receiver architectures used in other communication
   schemes, such as IR-UWB, show a strong compromise between low complexity
   and performance. In this paper, a novel receiver architecture for
   pulse-based communication based on a Continuous-time Moving Average
   (CTMA) symbol detection scheme is presented. This scheme bases its
   symbol decision on the received signal power maximum peak after the
   CTMA, which is implemented with a single low-pass filter. Moreover, an
   analytical model for the symbol detection is provided and it is
   quantitatively shown that the proposed CTMA scheme outperforms previous
   symbol detection schemes for pulse-based modulations in terms of Symbol
   Error Rate (SER). The low complexity and relaxed synchronization needed
   for this symbol detector makes this structure specially suited for the
   development of future transceivers for nano-devices.}},

Abstract = {{Recent accomplishments in physical-layer security research have shown
   that channel coding for secrecy can be effectively combined with
   security at other layers, such as cryptography at the application layer,
   in order to provide a significant security enhancement to communication
   systems. The goal of this previous work was to inhibit the passive
   eavesdropper in the wiretap channel model by encoding the ciphertext
   using nonsystematic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes prior to
   transmission and by exploiting the advantage of feedback for legitimate
   parties. The net result was propagation of a single packet erasure to
   the detriment of the entire message. The security enhancement was
   characterized assuming statistically independent packet erasure channels
   (PECs) for the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. In this paper,
   we go beyond these results by addressing correlated erasure events
   across the two channels in a wiretap feedback framework. The intuitive
   notion that high correlation across channels reduces secrecy is shown
   through the complete characterization of the correlated channel
   scenario. Furthermore, it is shown that security improvements are still
   achievable in the face of positive correlation by means of judicious
   physical-layer design, even when the eavesdropper has a better channel
   than the legitimate receiver.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of estimating throughput and average latency in
   wireless erasure networks with nodes having finite buffers. In these
   networks, packets are either lost due to link erasures or dropped
   because of full buffers. Further, a finite-buffer adaptation of
   backpressure routing policy is used. The exact Markov chain modeling of
   such networks for the sake of performance analysis turns out to be an
   extremely difficult problem in general due to the large number of states
   and their complicated transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel
   iterative method that estimates the performance parameters of such
   networks with much less complexity comparing to the exact analysis. The
   proposed framework leads to an accurate estimate of the steady-state
   probability distribution of buffer occupancies using which analytical
   expressions are obtained for throughput and average packet delay in the
   network. Finally, these analytical results are validated via

   rest of the network has to the Sink. One way to lengthen the
   time-to-partition or increase access to the Sink is to exploit some of
   the would-be-trapped energy to do cooperative transmission (CT) range
   extension to hop over the bottleneck node and communicate directly with
   the next-hop node (e. g., the Sink). To do this, approximate range
   doubling is necessary. In this paper, we investigate the potential for
   range doubling over Rayleigh faded channels of four CT schemes that are
   compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. We consider the effects of
   path loss disparities and how many cooperators are necessary for each CT
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative transmission in wireless networks provides diversity gain in
   multipath fading environments. Among all the proposed cooperative
   transmission schemes, delay diversity has the advantage of needing less
   coordination and higher spectrum efficiency. However, in a distributed
   network, the asynchrony comes from both carrier frequency and symbol
   timing between the cooperating relays. In this paper, a minimum mean
   square error fractionally spaced decision feedback equalizer
   (MMSE-FS-DFE) is developed to extract the diversity with large multiple
   carrier frequency offsets, its performance approaches the case without
   multiple carrier frequency offsets. The front end design for the
   receiver in this scenario is discussed, and a practical frame structure
   is designed for carrier frequency offsets and channel estimation. A
   subblock-wise decision-directed adaptive least squares (LS) estimation
   method is developed to solve the problem caused by error in frequency
   offset estimation. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical
   design for cooperative transmission (CT) with the delay diversity
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Advertising keywords recommendation is an indispensable component for
   online advertising with the keywords selected from the target Web pages
   used for contextual advertising or sponsored search. Several
   ranking-based algorithms have been proposed for recommending advertising
   keywords. However, for most of them performance is still lacking,
   especially when dealing with short-text target Web pages, that is, those
   containing insufficient textual information for ranking. In some cases,
   short-text Web pages may not even contain enough keywords for selection.
   A natural alternative is then to recommend relevant keywords not present
   in the target Web pages. In this article, we propose a novel algorithm
   for advertising keywords recommendation for short-text Web pages by
   leveraging the contents of Wikipedia, a user-contributed online
   encyclopedia. Wikipedia contains numerous entities with related entities
   on a topic linked to each other. Given a target Web page, we propose to
   use a content-biased PageRank on the Wikipedia graph to rank the related
   entities. Furthermore, in order to recommend high-quality advertising
   keywords, we also add an advertisement-biased factor into our model.
   With these two biases, advertising keywords that are both relevant to a
   target Web page and valuable for advertising are recommended. In our
   experiments, several state-of-the-art approaches for keyword
   recommendation are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that
   our proposed approach produces substantial improvement in the precision
   of the top 20 recommended keywords on short-text Web pages over existing
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In virtualized systems, several Virtual Machines (VM) running on a
   single hardware platform share and compete for the hardware resources
   such as memory, disk and network IO to meet a certain Quality of Service
   (QoS) requirements. It is critical to characterize and understand how
   the different workloads running in the VMs interact and share such
   resources to be able to map them efficiently onto processor cores and
   server hosts for optimal performance. This is especially important for
   resources such as memory controllers or the on-chip or inter-socket
   networks for which there is currently no software control.
   In this paper, we present a measurement-based performance analysis of
   server virtualization workloads from a real system using virtual
   machines that are part of the popular industry standard VMmark
   benchmark, a server consolidation benchmark. First, we characterize the
   relative resource contention and interference impact of VMs when
   multiple virtual workloads are run together. Second, we study the
   effects of co-locating different types of VMs under various VM to core
   placement schemes and discover the best placement for performance. We
   observe performance variations from 25-65\% for Database servers and
   from 7-40\% for File servers when compared to standalone VM depending on
   the placement of these VMs onto cores and the degree of sharing of
   resources. Finally, we propose an interference metric and regression
   model for the worst set of co-located VMs in our study. Based on
   different VM placement schemes we show that the overall server
   consolidation performance in a virtualized host can be improved by 8\%
   when the VMs are placed effectively.}},

Abstract = {{In a series of synthetic experiments we test the hypothesis that data
   assimilation algorithms can be employed to improve soil moisture
   estimation at spatial scales of hillslopes (e.g. 10(0)-10(2) m). We use
   the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to update an ensemble of
   hillslope-scale soil moisture fields simulated by a physically-based
   ecohydrology model with synthetic SMAP radar observations. For sparse
   vegetation, assimilation of the synthetic observations substantially
   reduces estimation error in near-surface soil moisture (e.g. top 5 cm),
   relative to the synthetic true soil moisture conditions. Key components
   of our data assimilation system are: (1) explicit representation of the
   impact of hillslope-scale topography on microwave observation, and (2) a
   Latin Hypercube-based soil parameter generator that preserves the

Abstract = {{Two-tier femtocell-based networks have been proposed as an economic
   solution to improve coverage and capacity in wireless cellular systems.
   Although widely studied in the literature, interference management in
   these networks remains as a technical challenge in need of effective
   solutions. In particular, the interference estimation is a relevant
   portion of the problem that enables correct operation of interference
   management schemes relying on this information. In this paper, a novel
   downlink cross-tier interference estimation approach is proposed based
   on spatio-temporal correlation techniques. An ordinary Kriging
   interpolator using Semivariogram Analysis is applied to the interfering
   signal followed by an autorregressive model. The signal estimation at
   the interfered users' location is exploited at the radio resource
   manager of the femtocell or macrocell base station by formulating a
   resource allocation problem that is solved by means of a heuristic
   algorithm. A practical procedure implementing this scheme in the network
   is also proposed. Numerical results show how performance of cross-tier
   interference management approaches can be optimized by implementing this
   idea.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for determining the power available
   to a passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, the Power
   Conversion Gain (PCG). The power conversion gain of a tag combines the
   tag's antenna pattern with its charge pump efficiency to give the system
   designer the tag's output power as a function of angle and maximum
   received input power. This metric is more useful for system designers
   because it helps to determine the tag's sensitivity to orientation which
   is exaggerated by the non-linearity of the charge pump. This paper
   demonstrates the use of PCG using measured results from a 4-stage
   Dickson charge pump operating at 5.8 GHz and a directional antenna as a
   worst case scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Hidden nodes cause unexpected collisions and interferences in mobile
   ad-hoc networks (MANETs). However, little attention has been given to
   the behavior of hidden nodes, especially when channels are under random
   bit errors. Exchanging RTS/CTS can avoid hidden node problems. However,
   undesirable overheads in every packet cause performance degradation, and
   this motivates many researchers to design new algorithms with
   modification of the IEEE 802.11 standard. In this paper, the impact of
   hidden nodes is thoroughly modeled using Markov chains. This model
   incorporates critical network parameters (random bit errors, packet
   lengths, number of users) in noisy MANETs channels. Through rigorous
   analysis, the study suggests the optimal packet lengths to be used in
   various channel conditions with the existence of hidden nodes. These
   optimal fragments effectively reduce the number of retransmissions
   caused by collisions from hidden nodes and corrupted packets due to
   random bit errors, which significantly improves throughput in noisy
   MANETs channels without modification of the standards.}},

Abstract = {{In IPTV networks, channel change latency represents a major obstacle in
   achieving broadcast-level quality video delivery. Since the content for
   channels, other than the one currently viewed, is not readily available
   at the client side, to receive the content corresponding to these
   channels, each request needs to go through the network, leading to
   significant, and oftentimes unacceptable, delays. To minimize this
   latency, various approaches have been proposed. These approaches
   typically require the use of dedicated servers near the access network
   to speed up the delivery of channel change packets. In this paper, we
   use such server-driven framework to develop a joint unicast- and
   multicast-based channel change protocol that relies on the use of (z)
   session-dependent multicast channel change streams to deliver the
   key-frame content to the zapping clients, and (ii) a dedicated unicast
   streaming server, which is referred to as the Channel Switch Coordinator
   (CSC), to deliver the channel change packets corresponding to the
   non-key-frames. In our framework, CSC server is also responsible for
   coordinating the received channel change requests and optimally
   allocating system resources for each received request.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on the tracking technology in use, a 6D motion gesture can be
   tracked and represented explicitly by the position and orientation or
   implicitly by the acceleration and angular speed. In this work, we first
   present the reasoning for the definition and recognition of motion
   gestures. Five basic feature vectors are then derived from the 6D motion
   data. Our main contribution is to investigate the relative effectiveness
   of various feature dimensions for motion gesture recognition in both
   user dependent and user independent cases. We also propose a feature
   normalization procedure and prove its effectiveness in achieving
   ``scale{''} invariance especially in the user independent case. Our
   study gives an insight into the attainable recognition rate with
   different tracking devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a general algorithmic framework based on WFSTs
   for implementing a variety of discriminative training methods, such as
   MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE. In contrast to the ordinary word lattices, the
   transducer-based lattices are more amenable to representing and
   manipulating the underlying hypothesis space and have a finer
   granularity at the HMM-state level. The transducers are processed into a
   two-layer hierarchy: at a high level, it is analogous to a word lattice,
   and each word transition embodies an HMM-state subgraph for that word at
   a lower level. This hierarchy combined with the appropriate
   customization of the transducers leads to a flexible implementation for
   all of the training criteria being discussed. The effectiveness of the
   framework is verified on two speech recognition tasks: Resource
   Management, and AT\&T SCANMail, an internal voicemail-to-text task.}},

Abstract = {{Gaussian mixture (GMM)-HMMs, though being the predominant modeling
   technique for speech recognition, are often criticized as being
   inaccurate to model heterogeneous data sources. In this work, we propose
   the stranded Gaussian mixture (SGMM)-HMM, an extension of the GMM-HMM,
   to explicitly model the dependence among the mixture components, i.e.,
   each mixture component is assumed to depend on the previous mixture
   component in addition to the state that generates it. In the evaluation
   over the Aurora 2 database, the proposed 20-mixture SGMM system obtains
   WER of 8.07\%, 10\% relative improvement over the baseline GMM system.
   The experiments demonstrate the discriminating power that would be

Abstract = {{Large-scale field programmable analog array (FPAA) ICs have made analog
   and analog-digital signal processing techniques accessible to a much
   wider community. Given this opportunity, we present in this paper a
   framework for considering analog signal processing techniques for
   low-power, portable systems. These techniques have become more important
   given the recent recognition of the power-efficiency wall for commercial
   digital ICs. The discussion focuses on the framework technique required
   to enable analog-digital signal processing techniques. A framework is
   needed to enable system designers to directly develop applications into
   these approaches that includes considering power consumed, system
   complexity/area, as well as other commercial metrics. A key part of this
   discussion is evolving existing Simulink FPAA design tools to work with
   this framework such that users have a similar experience one expects
   with digital system design, as well as model closely experimental data
   at a high-level framework. The result of these techniques is pulling
   analog computation towards the system level development as seen in
   digital system design over the last 30 years.}},
