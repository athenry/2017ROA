Abstract = {{Isoindigo and derivatives thereof were synthesized and characterized by
   means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and UV-vis absorption and
   fluorescence spectroscopies. The experimental results were compared with
   the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide
   structure property relationships on the basis of the type of substituent
   and attachment position (5,5' vs 6,6') on isoindigo. The integration of
   if-electron donors mainly affects the ionization potential (IP) as the
   isoindigo unit dictates the electron affinity (EA). The incorporation of
   electron withdrawing groups affects the EA through contributions of and
   if-effects that depend on the electron deficiency of the substituent.
   Perspectives on the photostability of isoindigo and its derivatives are
   presented along with a discussion about the relation between
   substitution pattern and the strength of the optical transitions.
   Functionalization of the 5(5') carbon in isoindigo leads to a smaller
   transition dipole moment when compared to substitution on carbon 6(6'),
   while having a small effect on the frontier orbital energies. These
   observations enhance our understanding of the electronic structure and
   optical properties of isoindigo and permit important advances in the
   establishment of unambiguous design parameters for the next generation
   of isoindigo-based oligomers and polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The experimentally measured elastic moduli and yield strengths of
   nanowires and nanofilaments vary widely in the literature and are often
   beyond the theoretical limits of the particular material. In this work,
   Si nanowires with very low defect densities were loaded in uniaxial
   tension to establish the origins of their apparently nonlinear
   constitutive behavior. The diameters of the nanowires ranged from 230 to
   460 nm and the growth directions were primarily {[}112] with the
   exception of a {[}111] oriented nanowire. The resulting fracture
   strengths of the nanowires ranged from 3.88 to 10.1 GPa. The nonlinear
   constitutive behavior was accompanied by fracture surfaces with features
   that were not commonly observed in Si. A nonlinear continuum elasticity
   model and electron microscopy established that reports of unusual
   deformation behavior and fracture surface morphologies are a direct
   byproduct of the electron and ion beam deposited adhesives (Pt-based in
   this work) used to affix specimens in place for testing. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a powerful approach toward new
   energy technology, especially for portable electronics. A theoretical
   model for the sliding-mode TENG is presented in this work. The finite
   element method was utilized to characterize the distributions of
   electric potential, electric field, and charges on the metal electrodes
   of the TENG. Based on the FEM calculation, the semi-analytical results
   from the interpolation method and the analytical V-Q-x relationship are
   built to study the sliding-mode TENG. The analytical V-Q-x equation is
   validated through comparison with the semi-analytical results.
   Furthermore, based on the analytical V-Q-x equation, dynamic output
   performance of sliding-mode TENG is calculated with arbitrary load
   resistance, and good agreement with experimental data is achieved. The
   theory presented here is a milestone work for in-depth understanding of
   the working mechanism of the sliding-mode TENG, and provides a
   theoretical basis for further enhancement of the sliding-mode TENG for
   both energy scavenging and self-powered sensor applications.}},

Abstract = {{The water retention curve plays a central role in numerical algorithms

   simulation to investigate the water retention curve for hydrate-bearing

   higher capillary pressures and the air entry pressure increases as a
   power function of hydrate saturation; (2) the air entry pressure is
   lower in sediments with patchy rather than distributed hydrate, with
   higher pore size variation and pore connectivity or with lower specimen
   slenderness along the flow direction; and (3) smaller specimens render
   higher variance in computed water retention curves, especially at high
   water saturation S-w>0.7. Results are relevant to other sediment pore
   processes such as bioclogging and mineral precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, mercury sorbents are disposed of in landfills, which may
   lead to contamination of soil and groundwater. In this work, the
   regeneration of activated carbon (AC) as a mercury sorbent was
   investigated. The decomposition of HgCl2 on the surface of pure AC was
   studied, as well as sorbent which has been treated with FeCl3 or NaCl.
   In all cases, the sorbent is found to be structurally stable through a
   single regeneration, which is verified through BET, XRD, and XPS
   analysis. The desorption of mercury from the sorbent is found to follow
   Henry's law. Additionally, a kinetic analysis suggests that although the
   presence of activated carbon lowers the energy requirement for the
   desorption of mercury, it significantly decreases the rate by decreasing
   the concentration of the HgCl2. FeCl3 and NaCl both promoted the
   decomposition of HgCl2, but FeCl3 did so more significantly, increasing
   the rate constants by a factor of 10 and decreasing the activation
   energy for the decomposition of HgCl2 by 14\% to 40\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Steady-state freshwater-seawater mixing zone in stratified coastal
   aquifers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{505}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The mixing zone between freshwater and intruding seawater, which
   controls regional groundwater flow dynamics and reactive transport
   processes, is the most important component in coastal aquifers.
   Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to
   investigate the effects of aquifer stratification on the thickness of a
   steady-state freshwater-seawater mixing zone. A series of experiments
   were implemented in a laboratory tank packed with three layers of
   coastal sands and manipulated by two flow cells for maintaining
   constant-head boundary conditions. Packed aquifers included a homogenous
   aquifer, a high hydraulic conductivity (K)-low K-high K stratified
   aquifer, and a low K-high K-low K stratified aquifer. Both tank-scale
   and field-scale density-dependent models were developed to simulate the
   laboratory experiments and to systematically investigate aquifer
   stratification effects on the thickness of a steady mixing zone with
   varying layer configurations. Results showed that when an aquifer layer
   with a low K overlies a layer with a relatively high K, slanting upward
   flow of diluted saltwater and re-circulated seawater flow are refracted
   at the interface between the two layers, resulting in streamline
   separation and a broad mixing zone in the low-K layer. By contrast, the
   mixing zone in a high-K layer is slightly narrowed when it overlies a
   layer with a relatively low K because flow refraction squeezes the
   streamlines within the mixing zone. The mixing-zone profile in
   head-controlled systems is a function of K contrast, but independent of
   the magnitude of K. Our results demonstrated the significant impact of
   aquifer stratification on controlling groundwater flow and solute
   transport in coastal subsurface environments and would have significant
   implications for studying physical, chemical and biological processes in
   coastal subsurface environments, as aquifer stratification is naturally
   prevalent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the digital backward propagation (DBP)
   nonlinear compensation (NLC) based on the modified logarithmic step size
   distribution. Different from regular constant step size, we use the
   logarithmic non-constant step size distribution in DBP. The compensation
   performance is investigated with Nyquist wavelength division
   multiplexing (NWDM) system. The modified logarithmic step size
   distribution is proposed and studied by introducing an attenuation
   adjusting factor k. As a proof of the concept, the optimal k factor is
   studied by simulation results with the noise figure, the input power,
   the transmission distance, the fiber attenuation, the span length, the
   step number per span, the dispersion value, the baud rate, the
   calculated subchannels, the pulse shape and the modulation formats.
   Reduced complexity and improved performance is observed by using the
   modified logarithmic step size distribution. Compared with constant step
   nonlinear compensation, the improved bit-error-ratio (BER) performance
   and Q-value for our scheme is demonstrated by 3x50-Gb/sNWDMpolarization
   division multiplexing quadrature phase shift keying (PDM-QPSK) signal
   with 1120-km single-mode fiber-28 (SMF-28) transmission and Erbium-doped

Abstract = {{Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are promising new materials which

   Despite the importance of mass transport in these materials there have

   gradient (PFG) NMR technique employing high magnetic field and large
   magnetic field gradients enabled the measurement of microscopic
   self-diffusion of ethane and ethylene in selected CMS membranes. For the
   studied Matrimid CMS membranes, the results of PFG NMR diffusion studies
   are compared with corresponding data obtained from macroscopic
   permeation measurements reported in the literature. It was found that
   although the ratios of ethane and ethylene diffusivities measured by
   these two techniques were the same within the experimental uncertainty,
   the diffusivities obtained by PFG NMR were several times larger than
   those obtained from permeation. The reasons for such difference are

Abstract = {{Computational methods able to identify elpasolite halides that
   crystallize with cubic symmetry are desirable since the isotropic
   properties of these materials have attractive manufacturing and optical
   properties. We compare the performance of three levels of theory for
   four elpasolite halides, Cs2NaGdBr6, Cs2NaLaBr6, Cs2LiLaI6, and
   Cs2LiScI6, in order to determine the minimum level of theory required to
   accurately predict the equilibrium crystal structures at finite
   temperatures. We evaluate ground state, simple harmonic, and
   quasiharmonic free energies for each material in the common cubic,
   tetragonal, and trigonal symmetries using Density Functional Theory
   (DFT) and phonon calculations. The highest level of theory based on a
   quasiharmonic model accounting for thermal expansion reproduces
   available experimental phase information for the studied materials and
   outperforms the simple harmonic model. As expected, ground state
   energies alone do not provide unambiguous information regarding expected
   finite temperature crystal structures and fail to identify interesting
   materials that crystallize with cubic symmetry. The methods we
   demonstrate will be useful for considering the large number of
   elpasolite halides that exist to identify desirable crystal structures.

   CNF concentrations (e.g. at 30 wt\% CNF), CNF-rich and PAN-rich regions
   were observed in the fiber cross-section along with large elongated
   voids along the fiber axis. These factors negatively affect the tensile
   properties. All composite fibers exhibited an increased glass transition
   temperature (T-g) by more than 15 degrees C along with a significant

   units were used in a molecular design of azo-chromophore monomers with
   enhanced second order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties:
   octafluorobiphenyl (OFB) and tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) ones.
   Polymerization of the monomers was performed to obtain polyurethanes
   with azo-chromophores in the main chain. Comparison of physical and
   optical properties of these polymers reveals that the main factor
   influencing the observed NLO activity of the latter is the inherent
   isomery of the macromolecular chains rather than a variation of the
   structure of electron-accepting groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocystals (CNCs) are reinforcing fillers of emerging
   interest for polymers due to their high modulus and potential for
   sustainable production. In this study, CNC-based composites with a
   waterborne epoxy resin matrix were prepared and characterized to
   determine morphology, water content, and thermal and mechanical
   properties. While some CNC aggregation was observed, the glass
   transition temperature (T-g) and modulus for the composites increased
   with increasing CNC content. Relative to neat epoxy, at 15 wt\% CNC the
   storage modulus increased by 100\%, the T-g increased from 66.5 degrees
   C to 75.5 degrees C, and tensile strength increased from 40 MPa to 60
   MPa, suggesting good adhesion between epoxy and CNC surfaces exposed to
   the matrix. Additionally, no additional water content resulting from CNC
   addition were observed. These results provide evidence that CNCs can
   improve thermomechanical performance of waterborne epoxy polymers and
   that they are promising as reinforcing fillers in structural materials
   and coatings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cermet membranes composited of Ni and doped barium cerate have been
   widely studied for hydrogen separation; however, their practical
   application is limited primarily by the relatively low permeation rate
   and instability of doped barium cerate in H2O and CO2 containing gases.
   Here we report our findings on the development of a thin-film cermet
   membrane consisting of Ni and BaZr0.1Ge0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb),
   supported on a porous Ni-BZCYYb substrate. High fluxes of 1.12 and 0.49
   ml min(-1) cm(-2) have been demonstrated at 900 degrees C and 700
   degrees C, respectively, when hydrogen was used as the feed gas on one
   side and N-2 as the sweep gas on the other side. Most importantly, the
   high-performance membrane can be easily fabricated by a cost-effective
   particle-suspension coating/co-firing process, offering great promise
   for large scale hydrogen separation applications. Copyright (C) 2013,

Abstract = {{The performance of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is
   directly associated to the flow channels design embedded in the bipolar
   plates. The flow field within a fuel cell must provide efficient mass
   transport with a reduced pressure drop through the flow channels in
   order to obtain a uniform current distribution and a high power density.
   In this investigation, three-dimensional fuel cell models are analyzed
   using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The proposed flow fields are
   radially designed tree-shaped geometries that connect the center flow
   inlet to the perimeter of the fuel cell plate. Three flow geometries
   having different levels of bifurcation were investigated as flow
   channels for PEM fuel cells. The performance of the fuel cells is
   reported in polarization and power curves, and compared with that of
   fuel cells using conventional flow patterns such as serpentine and
   parallel channels. Results from the flow analysis indicate that
   tree-shaped flow patterns can provide a relatively low pressure drop as
   well as a uniform flow distribution. It was found that as the number of
   bifurcation levels increases, a larger active area can be utilized in
   order to generate higher power and current densities from the fuel cell
   with a negligible increase in pumping power. Copyright (C) 2013,

   rate capability of the electrodes are significantly reduced, most likely
   due to the lower conductivity of Co3O4 than that of NiCo2O4. The 3D
   hybrid composite Ni(OH)(2)/ NiCo2O4/CFP electrodes demonstrate a high
   areal capacitance of 5.2 F/cm(2) at a cycling current density of 2
   rnA/cm(2), with a capacitance retention of 79\% as the cycling current

Abstract = {{A set of 98 nanoporous framework material (NFM) structures was
   investigated by classical Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for
   low-pressure O-2 adsorption properties (Henry's constant and isosteric

   high O-2 uptake experimentally as well as a subset of more than 2000
   structures previously screened for noble-gas uptake. While use of the
   general force field UFF is fruitful for noble-gas adsorption studies,
   its use is shown to be limited for the case of O-2 adsorptionone
   distinct limitation is a lack of sufficient O-2-metal interactions to be
   able to describe O-2 interaction with open metal sites. Nonetheless,
   those structures without open metal sites that have very small pores
   (<2.5 angstrom) show increased O-2/N-2 selectivity. Additionally,
   O-2/N-2 mixture simulations show that in some cases, H2O or N-2 can
   hinder O-2 uptake for NFMs with small pores due to competitive

Abstract = {{Binding of platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) to von Willebrand factor
   (VWF) initiates platelet adhesion to disrupted vascular surface under
   arterial blood flow. Flow exerts forces on the platelet that are
   transmitted to VWF-GPIb bonds, which regulate their dissociation.
   Mutations in VWF and/or GPIb may alter the mechanical regulation of
   platelet adhesion to cause hemostatic defects as found in patients with
   von Willebrand disease (VWD). Using a biomembrane force probe, we
   observed biphasic force-decelerated (catch) and force-accelerated (slip)
   dissociation of GPIb from VWF. The VWF A1 domain that contains the
   N-terminal flanking sequence Gln(1238)-Glu(1260) (1238-A1) formed
   triphasic slip-catch-slip bonds with GPIb. By comparison, using a short
   form of A1 that deletes this sequence (1261-A1) abolished the catch
   bond, destabilizing its binding to GPIb at high forces. Importantly,
   shear-dependent platelet rolling velocities on these VWF ligands in a
   flow chamber system mirrored the force-dependent single-bond lifetimes.
   Adding the Gln(1238)-Glu(1260) peptide, which interacted with GPIb and
   1261-A1 but not 1238-A1, to whole blood decreased platelet attachment
   under shear stress. Soluble Gln(1238)-Glu(1260) reduced the lifetimes of
   GPIb bonds with VWF and 1238-A1 but rescued the catch bond of GPIb with
   1261-A1. A type 2B VWD 1238-A1 mutation eliminated the catch bond by
   prolonging lifetimes at low forces, a type 2M VWD 1238-A1 mutation
   shifted the respective slip-catch and catch-slip transition points to
   higher forces, whereas a platelet type VWD GPIb mutation enhanced the
   bond lifetime in the entire force regime. These data reveal the
   structural determinants of VWF activation by hemodynamic force of the
   circulation.}},

Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{We present a Brownian dynamics investigation of 3-D Rouse and Zimm
   polymer translocation through solid-state nanopores. We obtain different
   scaling exponents alpha for both polymers using two initial
   configurations: minimum energy, and ` steady-state'. For forced
   translocation, Rouse polymers (no hydrodynamic interactions), shows a
   large dependence of a on initial configuration and voltage. Higher
   voltages result in crowding at the nanopore exit and reduced alpha. When
   the radius of gyration is in equilibrium at the beginning and end of
   translocation, alpha = 1 + upsilon where upsilon is the Flory exponent.
   For Zimm polymers (including hydrodynamic interactions), crowding is
   reduced and alpha = 2 upsilon. Increased pore diameter does not affect
   alpha at moderate voltages that reduce diffusion effects. For unforced
   translocation using narrow pores, both polymers give alpha = 1 + 2
   upsilon. Due to increased polymer-pore interactions in the narrow pore,
   hydrodynamic drag effects are reduced, resulting in identical scaling.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on efficient and accurate treatment of the
   intermolecular dispersion interaction using the CCD+ST(CCD) dispersion
   approach formulated by Williams et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 103, 4586
   (1995)]. We apply natural orbital truncation techniques to the solution
   of the monomer coupled-cluster double (CCD) equations, yielding
   substantial accelerations in this computationally demanding portion of
   the SAPT2+(CCD), SAPT2+(3)(CCD), and SAPT2+ 3(CCD) analyses. It is shown
   that the wholly rate-limiting dimer-basis particle-particle ladder term
   can be computed in a reduced natural virtual space which is essentially
   the same size as the monomer-basis virtual space, with an error on the
   order of a few thousandths of 1 kcal mol(-1). Coupled with our existing
   natural orbital techniques for the perturbative triple excitation
   contributions {[}E. G. Hohenstein and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys.
   133, 104107 (2010)], this technique provides speedups of greater than an
   order of magnitude for the evaluation of the complete SAPT2+ 3(CCD)
   decomposition, with a total error of a few hundredths of 1 kcal mol(-1).
   The combined approach yields tractability gains of almost 2x in the
   system size, allowing for SAPT2+3(CCD)/aug-cc-pVTZ analysis to be
   performed for systems such as adenine-thymine for the first time.
   Natural orbital based SAPT2+3(CCD)/aug-cc-pVTZ results are presented for
   stacked and hydrogen-bonded configurations of uracil dimer and the

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The framework hydrophobicity and flexibility of ZIF-8 are investigated
   by a detailed adsorption and diffusion study of a series of probe
   molecules including ethanol, 1-butanol, water, hexane isomers, xylene
   isomers, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. The prospects for using ZIF-8 in
   biofuel recovery and hydrocarbon separations are discussed in terms of
   adsorption or kinetic selectivities. ZIF-8 shows extremely low water
   vapor uptakes and is especially suitable for vapor phase butanol-based
   biofuel recovery. The extraordinary framework flexibility of ZIF-8 is
   demonstrated by the adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules that are much
   larger than its nominal pore size, such as m-xylene, o-xylene and
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. The calculation of corrected diffusion
   coefficients reveals an interesting spectrum of promising kinetic
   hydrocarbon separations by ZIF-8. These findings confirm that a
   molecular sieving effect tends to occur in the sorbate molecular size
   range of 4-6 angstrom rather than around the nominal ZIF-8 pore size of
   3.4 angstrom, due to its surprising framework flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{An automatic segmentation framework is proposed to segment the right
   ventricle (RV) in echocardiographic images. The method can automatically
   segment both epicardial and endocardial boundaries from a continuous
   echocardiography series by combining sparse matrix transform, a training
   model, and a localized region-based level set. First, the sparse matrix
   transform extracts main motion regions of the myocardium as eigen-images
   by analyzing the statistical information of the images. Second, an RV
   training model is registered to the eigen-images in order to locate the
   position of the RV. Third, the training model is adjusted and then
   serves as an optimized initialization for the segmentation of each
   image. Finally, based on the initializations, a localized, region-based
   level set algorithm is applied to segment both epicardial and
   endocardial boundaries in each echocardiograph. Three evaluation methods
   were used to validate the performance of the segmentation framework. The
   Dice coefficient measures the overall agreement between the manual and
   automatic segmentation. The absolute distance and the Hausdorff distance
   between the boundaries from manual and automatic segmentation were used
   to measure the accuracy of the segmentation. Ultrasound images of human
   subjects were used for validation. For the epicardial and endocardial
   boundaries, the Dice coefficients were 90.8 +/- 1.7\% and 87.3 +/-
   1.9\%, the absolute distances were 2.0 +/- 0.42 mm and 1.79 +/- 0.45 mm,
   and the Hausdorff distances were 6.86 +/- 1.71 mm and 7.02 +/- 1.17 mm,
   respectively. The automatic segmentation method based on a sparse matrix
   transform and level set can provide a useful tool for quantitative
   cardiac imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Blue fluorescent proteins (BFPs) offer visualization of protein location
   and behavior, but often suffer from high autofluorescent background and
   poor signal discrimination. Through dual-laser excitation of bright and
   photoinduced dark states, mutations to the residues surrounding the BFP
   chromophore enable long-wavelength optical modulation of BFP emission.
   Such dark state engineering enables violet-excited blue emission to be
   increased upon lower energy, green coillumination. Turning this green
   coillumination on and off at a specific frequency dynamically modulates
   collected blue fluorescence without generating additional background.
   Interpreted as transient photoconversion between neutral cis and anionic
   trans chromophoric forms, mutations tune photoisomerization and ground
   state tautomerizations to enable long-wavelength depopulation of the
   millisecond-lived, spectrally shifted dark states. Single mutations to
   the tyrosine-based blue fluorescent protein T203V/S205V exhibit enhanced
   modulation depth and varied frequency. Importantly, analogous single
   point mutations in the nonmodulatable BFP, mKalama1, creates a
   modulatable variant. Building modulatable BFPs offers opportunities for
   improved BFP signal discrimination vs background, greatly enhancing
   their utility.}},

Title = {{Confining the Nucleation and Overgrowth of Rh to the \{111\} Facets of
   Pd Nanocrystal Seeds: The Roles of Capping Agent and Surface Diffusion}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a systematic study of the spatially confined
   growth of Rh atoms on Pd nanocrystal seeds, with a focus on the blocking
   effect of a surface capping agent and the surface diffusion of adatoms.
   We initially used Pd cuboctahedrons as the seeds to illustrate the
   concept and to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach. Because the
   Pd\{100\} facets were selectively capped by a layer of chemisorbed Br-
   or I- ions, we were able to confine the nucleation and deposition of Rh
   atoms solely on the \{111\} facets of a Pd seed. When the synthesis was
   conducted at a relatively low temperature, the deposition of Rh atoms
   followed an island growth mode because of the high Rh-Rh interatomic
   binding energy. We also facilitated the surface diffusion of deposited
   Rh atoms by increasing the reaction temperature and decreasing the
   injection rate for the Rh precursor. Under these conditions, the
   deposition of Rh on the Pd\{111\} facets was switched to a layered
   growth mode. We further successfully extended this approach to a variety
   of other types of Pd polyhedral seeds that contained Pd\{111\} and
   Pd\{100\} facets in different proportions on the surface. As expected, a
   series of Pd-Rh bimetallic nanocrystals with distinctive elemental
   distributions were obtained. We could remove the Pd cores through
   selective chemical etching to generate Rh hollow nanoframes with
   different types and degrees of porosity. This study clearly demonstrates
   the importance of facet capping, surface diffusion, and reaction
   kinetics in controlling the morphologies of bimetallic nanocrystals
   during a seed-mediated process. It also provides a new direction for the
   rational design and synthesis of nanocrystals with spatially controlled
   distributions of elements for a variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional thermal management systems for lithium-ion batteries remove
   heat from the exterior surface of the battery, causing undesirable
   temperature increase and thermal gradients inside the battery.
   Internally cooling batteries can reduce both of these effects, improving
   safety and durability. In the present study, a novel internal cooling
   system that utilizes passive, liquid-vapor phase change processes is
   investigated using representative geometry and a surrogate heat source.
   Frictional and heat transfer characteristics of the representative
   cooling system with buoyancy driven flow are reported over a range of
   net heat inputs (94-6230 W L-1) and saturation temperatures (24 degrees
   C-33 degrees C). The results show that the mass flow rate increased to a
   maximum near a heat input of 1350 W L-1, and there was a slight
   influence of saturation temperature on the performance of the system. In
   addition, the calculated two-phase frictional pressure drops in the
   microchannel evaporator (3.175 mm x 160 mu m channels) are compared to
   the representative correlation database (D-h < 1 mm) and used to develop
   a new frictional pressure drop model with improved accuracy over the
   tested mass flux range (45 < G < 112 kg m(-2) s(-1)). The results
   presented here are utilized in a subsequent investigation to determine
   the performance improvement in large lithium-ion battery packs intended
   for electric and hybrid electric vehicular applications through internal
   cooling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces are a key
   component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older
   people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies
   to promote utilization of- and socialization in-shared spaces might
   improve independence and quality of life among older adults. The purpose
   of this paper is to describe the design, development, and technology
   studies conducted for understanding the social interactions of older
   adults in retirement communities. To understand current use of shared
   spaces, observational studies were conducted in a retirement community.
   Moreover, interventions were implemented to evaluate the impact of
   designed technologies in shared spaces. The results motivate the need
   for an automated behavioral mapping surveillance system to quantify
   social interactions among older adults and technology interventions in
   retirement communities' shared common areas. This paper describes the
   development of a video-based analysis system for understanding social
   interactions among older adults in retirement communities. Specific
   emphasis is given to describing the automated behavioral mapping
   surveillance system designed to monitor the number, length, and type of
   interactions of older adults in retirement communities. We hypothesize
   that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using
   video cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment,
   and discuss the development of a surveillance system specifically for
   quantifying social interaction. This study is relevant for the field of
   social robotics as an example of a realistic application domain.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We hypothesized that human cardiovascular responses to
   standing in reduced gravity environments, as on the Moon or Mars, could
   be modeled using a lower body positive pressure (LBPP) chamber. Methods:
   Heart rate, blood pressure, body segment fluid shifts, ECG, indexes of
   sympathetic, parasympathetic balance, and baroreflex control of the
   heart and periphery plus echocardiographic measures of cardiac function
   were recorded from seven men and seven women supine and standing at
   100\% (Earth), 40\% (similar to Mars), and 20\% (similar to Moon)
   bodyweights (BW). Results: The fluid shifted from the chest was greater
   when standing at 100\% BW than at 20\% and 40\% BW, while fluid pooled
   in the abdomen was similar at all BWs. Compared to moving from supine to
   standing at 100\% BW, moving to 20\% and 40\% BW resulted in smaller
   decreases in stroke volume and pulse pressure, smaller increases in
   heart rate and smaller decreases in parasympathetic control of heart
   rate, baroreflex slope, numbers of blood pressure ramps, and much
   reduced indexes of sympathetic drive to the heart and periphery.
   However, peripheral vascular resistance, systolic pressure, and
   baroreflex effectiveness were elevated during 20\% and 40\% BW, compared
   to supine and standing at 100\% BW. Discussion: Standing at reduced
   bodyweight suppressed indexes of sympathetic control of heart rate and
   peripheral vasomotion. Regulatory responses indicated a combination of
   arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex control: mean heart rate,
   vasomotion, and baroreflex sensitivity appeared to be more under
   cardiopulmonary control while baroreflex effectiveness appeared to be
   driven more by the arterial baroreflex.}},

Abstract = {{A novel attitude tracking control scheme is proposed for rigid
   spacecraft to simultaneously compensate for reaction wheel faults and
   reject external disturbances. The reconstruction of the reaction wheel
   faults and disturbances is treated as a problem of observing the state
   of a linear system with unknown inputs. A terminal sliding mode observer
   is proposed to reconstruct the reaction wheel faults and disturbances. A
   Lyapunov-based analysis shows that the observer asymptotically converges
   to the actual faults and disturbances with a finite time convergence.
   Then, with the reconstructed faults and disturbance information, a
   compensation control law is developed to guarantee that the desired
   attitude trajectories are followed in finite time. The key feature of
   the proposed control strategy is that it globally asymptotically
   stabilizes the system, even in the presence of reaction wheel faults and
   external disturbances. The attitude tracking performance using the
   proposed compensation control is evaluated through a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of generating a smooth reference path, given a finite family
   of discrete, locally optimal paths, is investigated. A finite
   discretization of the environment results in a sequence of obstacle-free
   square cells. The generated path must lie inside the channel generated
   by these obstacle-free cells, while minimizing certain performance
   criteria. Two constrained optimization problems are formulated and
   solved subject to the given geometric (linear) constraints and boundary
   conditions in order to generate a library of B-spline path templates
   offline. These templates are recalled during implementation and are
   merged together on the fly in order to construct a smooth and feasible
   reference path to be followed by a closed-loop tracking controller.
   Combined with a discrete path planner, the proposed algorithm provides a
   complete solution to the obstacle-free path-generation problem for an
   unmanned aerial vehicle in a computationally efficient manner, which is

Abstract = {{The fire-control solution is an important element of any modern weapon
   system, providing precise aiming of the gun to enable highly accurate
   projectile impact. To be practical, the fire-control solution must be
   computed rapidly and reliably while simultaneously including all
   pertinent physical effects that can alter the trajectory and impact
   point. Current fire-control solutions account for the effect of
   atmospheric wind in a rudimentary manner, typically assuming a constant
   crosswind that is estimated in the field or measured at the firing site.
   With the advent of advanced wind-measurement systems (light detection
   and ranging, for example), it is now possible to accurately measure
   three-dimensional wind velocities at numerous points approximately along
   the path of a direct-fire projectile. This article first shows the
   importance of wind knowledge along the line of fire for accuracy,
   particularly for long-range direct-fire shots. Then, a method to compute
   the fire-control solution of a projectile is defined, including the
   effect of exactly known spatially varying winds. By using a modified
   form of projectile linear theory that incorporates three-dimensional
   linearly varying atmospheric winds, a closed-form fire-control solution
   is obtained. Moreover, the solution can be rapidly computed. The key to
   the algorithm is partitioning the projectile linear-theory
   state-transition matrix in an input-output form that enables the aiming
   solution to be computed in terms of a desired impact point and measured
   atmospheric winds. The application of this algorithm is restricted to
   flat-fire trajectories where the angle of attack of the projectile
   remains low throughout because this is the key limitation of the
   projectile linear theory that must be maintained. The proposed algorithm
   is exercised on an example fire-control problem for such flat-fire
   trajectories with excellent results.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of engine placement and sweep on the flutter characteristics
   of an aft-swept flying wing resembling the Horten IV are investigated
   using the Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim and Stability of HALE Aircraft. The
   analysis was validated against the published results for divergence and
   flutter of swept wings and found to be in excellent agreement. Moreover,
   the modal frequencies and damping obtained for the Goland wing were
   found in excellent agreement with published results based on a new
   continuum-based unsteady aerodynamic formulation. This aircraft exhibits
   a nonoscillatory yawing instability, expected in aircraft with neither a
   vertical tail nor yaw control. More important, however, is the presence
   of a low-frequency ``body-freedom flutter{''} mode. The aircraft center
   of gravity was held fixed during the study, which allowed the aircraft
   controls to trim similarly for each engine location and minimized
   flutter speed variations along the inboard span. The maximum flutter
   speed occurred for engine placement just outboard of 60\% span with
   engine center of gravity forward of the elastic axis. The body-freedom
   flutter mode was largely unaffected by the engine placement except for
   cases in which the engine is placed at the wing tip and near the elastic
   axis. In the absence of engines, aerodynamics, and gravity, a region of
   minimum kinetic energy density for the first symmetric free-free bending
   mode is also near the 60\% span. A possible relationship between the
   favorable flutter characteristics obtained by placing the engines at
   that point, and the region of minimum kinetic energy is briefly
   explored.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an analysis of the response of swirling premixed
   flames to helical disturbances, i.e., where the flow fluctuations have
   an azimuthal dependence of the form (u) over cap (')(i)infinity exp(im
   theta) and m denotes the helical mode number. Results elaborate the
   nature of local flame wrinkling and heat release fluctuations.
   Significantly, these results show that these different induced
   fluctuations exhibit very different sensitivities to helical mode number
   m, swirl strength, and dimensionless frequency. In addition, the degree
   of axisymmetry of the time averaged flame plays a crucial role in these
   interactions, particularly in how flow disturbances (u) over cap (')(i)
   translate into heat release oscillations. Thus, the helical modem, with
   the dominant contribution to local flame wrinkling and heat release, m =
   m(0), and spatially integrated heat release fluctuations, m = m(1), is
   generally different. For example, helical mode m, leading to the largest
   amplitude of local flame wrinkling and heat release in a solid body
   swirl flowfield, is given by m(0)sigma = U-t,U-f/U-c - 1, where sigma is
   the ratio of swirl angular rotation rate to forcing frequency,U-t,U-f is
   the component of mean tangential velocity resolved along the axial
   forcing direction, and U-c is the phase speed of the convecting vortex.
   In contrast, only the axisymmetric mode, m(1) = 0, leads to global
   surface area fluctuations in axisymmetric flames, which are also
   completely insensitive to swirl number. Because the maximum amplitude of
   local flame wrinkling is, in general, excited by helical modes with m
   not equal 0, care must be taken in interpreting the significance of
   large scale helical flame flapping, as often is captured from planar
   experimental data or visualized in computations.}},

Abstract = {{A linear acoustic analysis has been conducted to study the combustion
   instability characteristics of three-dimensional baffled combustion
   chambers. The theoretical formulation is based on a generalized wave
   equation. Normal mode expansion and spatial averaging techniques are

   specific effects of radial and circumferential baffles, and the
   mechanisms by which baffles eliminate combustion instabilities, are
   presented. Longitudinalization of transverse waves inside baffle
   compartments, restriction of velocity fluctuations near the injector
   face, and reduction in oscillation frequency are studied systematically.
   The effects of mean flow, temperature nonuniformities, and combustion
   response on the baffle design and stability behaviors are investigated.
   Potential destabilizing influences of baffles are found to be the
   concentration of acoustic pressure at the injector face and of acoustic

Abstract = {{Supersonic retropropulsion is an entry, descent, and landing technology

   for the supersonic retropropulsion flowfield to assist in evaluating the

   flight-relevant conditions and scales. This model was used to explore
   the impact of operating conditions, required propulsion system
   performance, propulsion system composition, and vehicle configuration on
   the integrated aerodynamic drag characteristics of full-scale vehicles
   for Mars entry, descent, and landing. The forebody aerodynamic drag and
   axial force characteristics of vehicles at two different mission scales

Abstract = {{The Mars Pathfinder probe entered the Martian atmosphere in 1997 and

   objective of this paper is to reconstruct the Pathfinder entry vehicle's
   aerothermal heating and heat shield material response using updated
   modeling tools and approaches in both direct and inverse manners. The
   direct approach consists of performing updated computational fluid
   dynamics calculations on a newly reconstructed entry trajectory to
   characterize the vehicle's heating environment. From the calculated
   heating boundary conditions, the heat shield in-depth temperature
   response is computed using an updated thermal response and ablation
   model for the SLA material. These predictions are compared directly to
   the flight data. In addition to the direct comparison approach, inverse
   methods are used to estimate boundary conditions that result in a closer
   match between the flight data and subsurface temperature predictions.
   The unblown surface heat transfer coefficient is reconstructed as a
   function of time using whole-time domain least-squares methods in
   conjunction with regularization techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Flight data from an entry, descent, and landing sequence can be used to
   reconstruct the vehicle's trajectory, aerodynamic coefficients, and the
   atmospheric profile experienced by the vehicle. Past Mars missions have
   not contained instrumentation that would allow for the separation of
   uncertainties in the atmosphere and the aerodynamic database. The 2012
   Mars Science Laboratory took measurements of the pressure distribution
   on the aeroshell forebody during entry and allows freestream atmospheric
   conditions to be partially observable. Methods to estimate the flight
   performance statistically using onboard measurements are demonstrated
   here through the use of simulated Mars data. A range of statistical
   estimators, specifically the extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman
   filter, are used to demonstrate which estimator best quantifies the
   states and the uncertainties in the flight parameters. The techniques
   demonstrated herein are planned for application to the Mars Science
   Laboratory flight dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects nearly 1.4
   million Americans. The etiology of Crohn's disease is not completely
   understood, however, research has suggested a genetic link. There is
   currently no known cure for Crohn's disease and, as a result, most
   government-funded research is being conducted to increase the quality of
   life of afflicted patients (i.e. reducing chronic inflammation and
   alleviating growth impairment in pediatric patients). A number of
   treatment options are available including an alpha-4 integrin inhibitor
   and several TNF-alpha inhibitors. Furthermore, research is being
   conducted on several alternative treatment options to help understand
   exactly which cellular mechanisms (i.e. inducing apoptosis in
   leukocytes) are required for clinical efficacy. This review seeks to
   chronicle the current available treatment options for patients affected
   by Crohn's disease to aid in understanding potential cellular
   mechanistic requirements for an efficacious drug, and shed light on
   potential options for future treatment. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{555-566}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effectiveness of FRP wire to confine
   concrete. For this purpose, axial compressive tests are conducted with
   three parameters, peak strength of concrete, confining amount of FRP
   wire, and epoxy application. The behavior of the FRP-wire confined
   concrete is examined in the axial and circumferential directions as well
   as in terms of volumetric strain. Each behavior is discussed according
   to the stiffness ratio of the confining FRP wire to concrete. Moreover,
   the confinement effectiveness of the FRP wire is estimated using the
   actual rupture strain of the FRP wire as well as the ultimate tensile
   strain. Both cases show slightly larger effectiveness than that of FRP
   sheet confined concrete. The external jacket of the FRP wire increases
   the peak strength satisfactory and restrains volumetric expansion when
   the stiffness ratio of the jacket is sufficiently large. The failure of
   the FRP wire confined concrete occurs at the mid-height of the cylinder.
   Furthermore, this study investigates the behavior of partially confined
   concrete exhibiting smaller peak strength compared to the corresponding
   fully confined specimen, as it appears to have a smaller stiffness
   ratio. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The influence of design parameters on the response of bridges

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{585-599}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the emerging tools for protecting bridges from the damaging
   effects of earthquakes is the use of seismic isolation systems. The
   Friction Pendulum System (FPS) is a sliding-based seismic isolator that
   can be applied to a wide range of bridge types. While the individual
   response of the FPS is well understood, the global effectiveness of
   seismic isolation as a function of varying bridge design parameters has
   not been adequately quantified. A detailed three-dimensional analytical
   model of an FPS-isolated multi-span continuous steel girder bridge was
   analyzed with the nonlinear time-history method for a range of six
   design parameters. The results illustrate that seismic isolation with
   the FPS is less effective for bridges that have flexible sub-structure
   characteristics, compared with those that are stiffer. Bridges with
   large superstructure flexibility tend to be affected less from the
   vertical components of the ground motions. Bridges with larger
   superstructure mass acquire smaller isolator displacements but place
   larger demands on the load carrying elements in the sub-structure.
   Unlike non-isolated bridges, the seismic response characteristics of
   bridges seismically isolated with the FPS were minimally affected by
   skew. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lightning strokes are known to cause direct heating and ionization of
   the D region, some of which are detected via scattering of VLF
   transmitter signals and are known as Early VLF events. The disturbed
   ionosphere typically recovers in many tens of seconds. New experimental
   evidence is presented demonstrating that the scattering pattern and
   onset amplitude of Early VLF events are strongly related to both the
   magnitude and polarity of causative lightning peak current. Observations
   of Early VLF events at nine Stanford VLF receiver sites across the
   continental United States are combined with lightning geolocation data
   from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). During January and
   March 2011, NLDN recorded 7769 intense lightning discharges with high
   peak currents (>100 kA) generating 1250 detected Early VLF events. We
   show that the size of the scattered field due to the ionospheric
   disturbance increases with the peak current intensity of the causative
   lightning discharge. The most intense peak currents of >+200 and <-250
   kA disturb VLF transmitter signals as far as approximate to 400 km away
   from the lightning stroke. Early VLF event detection probability also
   increases rapidly with peak current intensity. On the other hand, the
   observed VLF amplitude change is not significantly dependent on the peak
   current intensity. Stroke polarity is also important, with positive
   strokes being approximate to 5 times more likely to generate Early VLF
   disturbances than negative strokes of the same intensity. Intense
   positive cloud-to-ground lightning discharges, especially when occurring
   over the sea, are also more likely to produce Early VLF events with long
   recovery (many minutes).}},

Abstract = {{The response times of pressure-sensitive particles to passing shockwaves
   were measured to investigate their ability to accurately determine

   acetylacetonate. For this work, porous silicon dioxide
   pressure-sensitive beads (PSBeads) were used. Two synthetic procedures
   were used to fabricate the particles. In the first, a one-step method
   loaded dyes during the synthesis of microbeads, in the second a two-step
   method synthesized the microbeads first, then loaded the dyes. The shock
   tube facility was used to measure the response times of microbeads to
   fast pressure jumps. The study involved testing multiple luminophors
   loaded in microbeads with various size distributions. Response times for
   the silica-based microbeads ranged between 26 mu s and 462 mu s (at 90\%

Title = {{Actuation of atomic force microscopy microcantilevers using contact
   acoustic nonlinearities}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A new method of actuating atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers is
   proposed in which a high frequency (>5 MHz) wave modulated by a lower
   frequency (similar to 300 kHz) wave passes through a contact acoustic
   nonlinearity at the contact interface between the actuator and the
   cantilever chip. The nonlinearity converts the high frequency, modulated
   signal to a low frequency drive signal suitable for actuation of
   tapping-mode AFM probes. The higher harmonic content of this signal is
   filtered out mechanically by the cantilever transfer function, providing
   for clean output. A custom probe holder was designed and constructed
   using rapid prototyping technologies and off-the-shelf components and
   was interfaced with an Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM, which was then used
   to evaluate the performance characteristics with respect to standard
   hardware and linear actuation techniques. Using a carrier frequency of
   14.19 MHz, it was observed that the cantilever output was cleaner with
   this actuation technique and added no significant noise to the system.
   This setup, without any optimization, was determined to have an
   actuation bandwidth on the order of 10 MHz, suitable for high speed
   imaging applications. Using this method, an image was taken that
   demonstrates the viability of the technique and is compared favorably to
   images taken with a standard AFM setup. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is investigated in a dilute
   gas-particle mixture using three-dimensional numerical simulations. This
   work extends an earlier two-dimensional study {[}S. Ukai, K.
   Balakrishnan, and S. Menon, ``On Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in dilute
   gas-particle mixtures,{''} Phys. Fluids 22, 104103 (2010)] to a larger
   parameter space consisting of variations in the mass loading and the
   particle size as well as considering both single-mode and multi-mode
   interface initializations. In addition, the effect of the presence of
   particles on re-shock RMI is also investigated. Single-phase numerical
   predictions of the mixing layer growth-rate are shown to compare well to
   both experimental and theoretical results. In a dilute gas-particle
   mixture, the initial growth-rate of RMI shows similar trends compared to
   previous work; however, the current numerical predictions show that
   there is an observable increase, not previously predicted, in the growth
   of the mixing layer at higher mass loadings. For the range of cases
   considered, an increase as much as 56\% is observed. This increase is
   attributed to additional vorticity production in the mixing layer
   resulting from inter-phase momentum coupling. Moreover, the presence of
   particles introduces a continuous drag on the gas-phase resulting in a
   delay in the time at which re-shock occurs. This delay, which is
   observed to be as much as 6\%, is largest for higher initial mass
   loadings and smaller particle radii and has a corresponding effect on
   both the growth-rate of the mixing-layer after re-shock and the final
   width of the mixing layer. A new semi-analytical correlation is
   developed and verified against the numerical data to predict the
   re-shocked RMI growth-rate in dilute gas-particle flows. The correlation
   shows that the re-shock RMI growth-rate is linearly proportional to the
   velocity jump at re-shock, the molecular mixing fraction, and the
   multi-phase Atwood number. Depending on the initial mass loading and
   particle radii, the re-shock RMI growth-rates were observed to be
   reduced by as much as 48\% in some cases with variations of around 26\%
   in the width of the mixing layer after re-shock. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Worldwide occupational safety statistics show that the construction

   Falls remain a major concern as they contribute to very serious injuries

   internationally operating companies are in need of tools that allow
   ubiquitous understanding and planning of safety regardless in which
   country they operate. The presented approach is based on statistical
   processing of the accident rates to determine whether the accident black
   spots are comparable in the United States and Germany. The next step was
   the analysis of the guidelines and measures to prevent falls at

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) has been proposed as a
   promising material for electrical interconnection and heat dissipation,
   because of its high electrical and thermal conductivity. Defects and
   impurities in synthesized VACNT, however, lead to unsatisfactory
   performance in these applications. To improve the quality of VACNT, we
   systematically studied the effects of various growth parameters on the
   quality of VACNT, including growth temperature, the amount of water
   vapor, carbon source, and hydrogen gas. By tailoring these parameters,
   we successfully synthesized high-quality VACNTs that were confirmed by
   Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. These findings might
   be helpful for the applications of VACNT in many fields. VACNT-based
   thermal interface material was successfully made and a low thermal
   resistance of similar to 9.0 mm(2)KW(-1) suggests VACNTs' promising
   potentials in current demanding thermal management.}},

Abstract = {{Cooling is a significant challenge for high-performance and high-power
   3-D ICs. In this paper, tier-specific microfluidic cooling technology is
   proposed and experimentally evaluated in a 3-D stack. Different stacking
   scenarios are experimentally evaluated including: 1) a
   memory-on-processor stack; 2) a processor-on-processor stack with equal
   power dissipation; 3) a processor-on-processor stack with different
   power dissipations; and 4) a two-tier 3-D stack with each tier
   containing four cores along the flow direction. Compared with
   conventional microfluidic cooling, the tier-specific cooling is shown to
   reduce the pumping power by 37.5\% by preventing overcooling when an
   operating temperature is specified. The results are benchmarked with an
   air-cooled heat sink. The impact of the lateral thermal gradient along
   the flow direction on the electrical performances, including leakage
   power and clock frequency, is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic cooling is proposed as a solution to reject heat from a 3-D
   IC stack of high power chips. However, the integration of interlayer
   microfluidic cooling in 3-D ICs inevitably increases wafer thickness and
   thus presents possible challenges for through-silicon via (TSV)
   integration. This paper discusses the thermal and electrical co-design
   of a microfluidic heat sink compatible with TSV technology. A
   TSV-compatible micropinfin heat sink (MPFHS) with a height of 200 mu m,
   a micropin-fin diameter of 150 mu m, and a pitch of 225 mu m is
   fabricated. The fabricated MPFHS is experimentally shown to maintain the
   chip junction temperature <50 degrees C at a power density >100 W/cm(2)
   for a flow rate of 70 mL/min. The thermal results are benchmarked with
   an air-cooled heat sink and a chip junction temperature reduction of
   >33\% is observed. A 3 x 3 array of TSVs, each with a diameter of 10 mu
   m and a height of 178 mu m (18: 1 aspect ratio), is integrated into each
   micropin-fin. This results in a TSV density of 17424 cm(-2) in the
   microfluidic heat sinks. Using four-point probing, the measured
   resistance of TSVs is 36.5 +/- 1.5 m Omega.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in 3-D integrated circuit (3-DIC) technology have allowed for
   advantages in integration, system speed, and power consumption for
   digital systems. In systems operating at very high data rates with large
   data width, the effect of simultaneous switching noise (SSN) can,
   however, drastically affect system performance. Therefore, the effect of
   SSN in the power delivery network (PDN) design of a through silicon via
   (TSV)-based 3-D stack has been investigated in this paper, and eye
   diagrams have been simulated in each level of the stack to analyze power
   supply noise and transition jitter. Using a novel PDN design concept
   based on constant voltage power transmission lines, it is shown that
   this new PDN design can significantly improve signal quality in a 3-DIC
   application. The 3-D system considered here consists of a PCB, an
   interposer, and three IC dies. Each IC contains a TSV layer, PDN, and

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{60-69}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A savanna system is a natural ecosystem in which the competition between
   grass and woody vegetation in a semi-arid rangeland should be maintained
   for its sustainable development. Finding an optimal management plan for
   obtaining maximum economic profit from raising cattle without loss of
   sustainability of the savanna system during a planning period is a great
   challenge for rangeland managers. In this study, we formulate the
   sustainable development planning of the savanna system as an optimal
   control model, in which maximization of the stocking rate of cattle
   during the planning period is chosen as the objective while sustainable
   development requirements are achieved through the constraints
   represented by the desired final state of the system. Using Pontryagin's
   maximum principle, the model is transformed into a two-point
   boundary-value problem with nonlinear differential equations that is
   then solved using an iterative approach. An example with a specified
   desired final state in a savanna system without fire is used to
   demonstrate the performance of the model and the algorithm. Numerical
   experiments show that the planning strategy obtained from the optimal
   control model achieves maximum economic profit from raising cattle
   during the planning period and simultaneously improves the resilience of
   the system and maintains sustainable development of the rangeland. The
   outcomes demonstrate that resilience, sustainable development and
   economic profit are consistent concepts in optimal management strategy
   for rangeland management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experimental and analytical research has shown that higher
   in-fluid quality factors (Q) are achieved by actuating microcantilevers
   in the lateral flexural mode, especially for microcantilevers having
   larger width-to-length ratios. However, experimental results show that
   for these geometries the resonant characteristics predicted by the
   existing analytical models differ from the measurements. A recently
   developed analytical model to more accurately predict the resonant
   behaviour of these devices in viscous fluids is described. The model
   incorporates viscous fluid effects via a Stokes-type fluid resistance
   assumption and Timoshenko beam' effects (shear deformation and rotatory
   inertia). Unlike predictions based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the
   new theoretical results for both resonant frequency and Q exhibit the
   same trends as seen in the experimental data for in-water measurements
   as the beam slenderness decreases. An analytical formula for Q is also
   presented to explicitly illustrate how Q depends on beam geometry and on
   beam and fluid properties. Beam thickness effects are also examined and
   indicate that the analytical results yields good numerical estimates of
   Q for the thinner (5 m) specimens tested, but overestimate Q for the
   thicker (20 m) specimens, thus suggesting that a more accurate fluid
   resistance model should be introduced in the future for the latter case.}},

Abstract = {{The HKUST-1 metal-organic framework (MOF) was selected because of the
   large internal surface area, excellent stability and known properties.
   Mechanical strain is generated upon the adsorption of analytes into the
   MOF; it is proportional to concentration and is a function of adsorbed
   species. Piezoresistive microcantilevers serve as a transduction
   mechanism to convert surface strain into electrical signals. N-doped
   piezoresistive cantilever arrays were fabricated with ten structures per
   die. Thin films of HKUST-1 were grown at room temperature using
   layer-by-layer techniques. Dry nitrogen was used as a carrier gas to
   expose devices to varying concentrations of 12 different volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs). Results show that stress-induced
   piezoresistive microcantilever array sensors with MOF coatings can
   provide a highly sensitive and reversible sensing mechanism for water
   vapour and methanol. Characteristic response features allow
   discrimination based on shape, response time constants and magnitude of
   response for other VOCs. Devices provided reliable data and proved
   durable over 18 months of testing. The key advantages of this type of
   sensor are higher sensitivity with a microporous MOFs, reversible
   response, single chip sensing system and low power operation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to study the performance of an
   inexpensive high-surface-area nanoporous titanium oxide (TiO2) on the
   CO2/H-2 separation and resulting pre-combustion CO2 capture. The
   experiments were carried out at different temperatures (25, 50, 75, 100,
   and 125 degrees C) and pressures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 bar)
   using a fixed-bed adsorber. The data obtained for the pure component
   isotherms and binary gas mixtures were correlated using Sips and
   Langmuir-Freundlich binary-component-expanded isotherm adsorption (LFBE)
   models, respectively. Also, the deactivation model was used to simulate
   the observed CO2 sorption breakthrough curves. Experimental results show
   that the capture capacities of the sorbent for both H-2 and CO2 were
   improved with the increase in the pressure and decrease in the
   temperature. The maximum sorption capacities for pure CO2 and H-2 were
   found to be 14.4 and 5.2 mmol/g of TiO2 at 35 bar and 25 degrees C,
   respectively. The increase in the temperature and decrease in the
   pressure improve the sorption selectivity of TiO2 for CO2. The
   selectivity value of TiO2 reached 9.87 at 125 degrees C and 5 bar for a
   CO2/H-2 molar ratio of 50:50. TiO2 also shows great stability and
   regenerability. This study indicates that nanoporous TiO2 is potentially
   a cost-effective and robust CO2/H-2 separation agent and provides the
   knowledge needed for further demonstration of the nanoporous TiO2-based
   pre-combustion CO2 separation technology.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare the motor performance of
   tongue, using Tongue Drive System, to hand operation for relatively
   complex tasks under different levels of background physical exertion.
   Thirteen young able-bodied adults performed tasks that tested the
   accuracy and variability in tracking a sinusoidal waveform, and the
   performance in playing two video games that require accurate and rapid
   movements with cognitive processing using tongue and hand under two
   levels of background physical exertion. Results show additional
   background physical activity did not influence rapid and accurate
   displacement motor performance, but compromised the slow waveform
   tracking and shooting performances in both hand and tongue. Slow
   waveform tracking performance by the tongue was compromised with an
   additional motor or cognitive task, but with an additional motor task
   only for the hand. Practitioner Summary: We investigated the influence
   of task complexity and background physical exertion on the motor
   performance of tongue and hand. Results indicate the task performance
   degrades with an additional concurrent task or physical exertion due to
   the limited attentional resources available for handling both the motor
   task and background exertion.}},

Abstract = {{The Opportunistic Large Array (OLA) is a simple form of cooperative
   transmission, in which a group of single-antenna nodes decode the same
   packet, then a short time later relay the packet simultaneously in
   orthogonal or space-time coded channels. The authors have previously
   shown that OLA transmissions can be adequately synchronized so they
   appear to a receiver as having come from a conventional array with
   co-located antennas doing transmit diversity. OLAs have been considered
   as a basis for rapid single-packet broadcasting in multi-hop networks,
   however, there are few studies that consider OLA broadcasting of
   multiple co-channel packets. Using the continuum assumption
   (approximated by high density networks), we focus on broadcast
   throughput optimization, as determined by the packet insertion rate at
   the source. We consider spatial pipelining, which means broadcasting a
   packet before the previous co-channel packet has cleared the network. We
   show theoretically that for infinitely large networks the feasibility of
   spatial pipelining depends on the path loss exponent. For finite
   networks, we study the propagation behavior of spatially pipelined
   packets using numerical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Gait dysfunction and postural instability are two debilitating symptoms
   in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Tai Chi exercise has recently
   gained attention as an attractive intervention for persons with PD
   because of its known potential to reduce falls and improve postural
   control, walking abilities, and safety at a low cost. The purpose of
   this report is to investigate the effect of Tai Chi exercise on dynamic
   postural control during gait initiation and gait performance in persons
   with idiopathic PD, and to determine whether these benefits could be
   replicated in two different environments, as complementary projects. In
   these two separate projects, a total of 45 participants with PD were
   randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi group or a control group. The Tai
   Chi groups in both projects completed a 16-week Tai Chi exercise
   session, while the control groups consisted of either a placebo (i.e.,
   Qi-Gong) or non-exercise group. Tai Chi did not significantly improve
   Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III score, selected gait
   initiation parameters or gait performance in either project. Combined
   results from both projects suggest that 16 weeks of class-based Tai Chi
   were ineffective in improving either gait initiation, gait performance,
   or reducing parkinsonian disability in this subset of persons with PD.
   Thus the use of short-term Tai Chi exercise should require further study
   before being considered a valuable therapeutic intervention for these
   domains in PD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A surge block treatment method (i.e. inserting a solid rod plunger with
   a flat seal that closely fits the casing interior into a well and
   stocking it up and down) was performed for the rehabilitation of wells
   clogged with biomass and for the collection of time series sediment
   samples during in situ bioremediation tests for U(VI) immobilization at
   a the U.S. Department of Energy site in Oak Ridge, TN. The clogging
   caused by biomass growth had been controlled by using routine surge
   block treatment for18 times over a nearly four year test period. The
   treatment frequency was dependent of the dosage of electron donor
   injection and microbial community developed in the subsurface. Hydraulic
   tests showed that the apparent aquifer transmissivity at a clogged well
   with an inner diameter (ID) of 10.16 cm was increased by 8-13 times
   after the rehabilitation, indicating the effectiveness of the
   rehabilitation. Simultaneously with the rehabilitation, the surge block
   method was successfully used for collecting time series sediment samples
   composed of fine particles (clay and silt) from wells with ID 1.9-10.16
   cm for the analysis of mineralogical and geochemical composition and
   microbial community during the same period. Our results demonstrated
   that the surge block method provided a cost-effective approach for both
   well rehabilitation and frequent solid sampling at the same location.

Abstract = {{The inhibitory effect of two widely used quaternary ammonium compounds
   (QACs) - alkyl benzyl dimethyl (AB) and hexadecyl trimethyl (HD)
   ammonium chloride - on fermentation, methanogenesis and
   pentachloroaniline (PCA) dechlorination was assessed using a mixed,
   methanogenic, PCA-dechlorinating culture amended with AB or HD at a
   concentration range from 5 to 70 mu M. PCA dechlorination was inhibited
   at 5 mu M AB and was completely inhibited at 25 or 5 mu M by AB or HD,
   respectively. However, the PCA dechlorination pathway was the same in
   both the QACs-free and QACs-amended culture series. Fermentation
   (acidogenesis) and methanogenesis were inhibited by both AB and HD at
   and above 25 mu M but to a lesser degree than PCA dechlorination.
   Overall, HD resulted in a more severe inhibition of the mixed culture
   than AB. Adsorption of both QACs to the mixed culture biomass followed
   the Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption affinity of HD for the
   mixed culture biomass was significantly higher than that of AB, which
   may be related to the observed higher inhibitory effects of HD compared
   to AB. Both AB and HD were not degraded in the mixed, dechlorinating
   culture used in this study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Triboelectric Nanogenerators as New Energy Technology for Self-Powered
   Systems and as Active Mechanical and Chemical Sensors}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectrification is an effect that is known to each and every one
   probably since ancient Greek time, but it is usually taken as a negative
   effect and is avoided in many technologies. We have recently invented a
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that is used to convert mechanical
   energy into electricity by a conjunction of triboelectrification and
   electrostatic induction. As for this power generation unit, in the inner
   circuit, a potential is created by the triboelectric effect due to the
   charge transfer between two thin organic/inorganic films that exhibit
   opposite tribo-polarity; in the outer circuit, electrons are driven to
   flow between two electrodes attached on the back sides of the films in
   order to balance the potential. Since the most useful materials for TENG
   are organic, it is also named organic nanogenerator, which is the first
   using organic materials for harvesting mechanical energy. In this paper,
   we review the fundamentals of the TENG in the three basic operation
   modes: vertical contact-separation mode, in-plane sliding mode, and
   single-electrode mode. Ever since the first report of the TENG in
   January 2012, the output power density of TENG has been improved 5
   orders of magnitude within 12 months. The area power density reaches 313
   W/m(2), volume density reaches 490 kW/m(3), and a conversion efficiency
   of similar to 60\% has been demonstrated. The TENG can be applied to
   harvest all kinds of mechanical energy that is available but wasted in
   our daily life, such as human motion, walking, vibration, mechanical
   triggering, rotating tire, wind, flowing water, and more. Alternatively,
   TENG can also be used as a self-powered sensor for actively detecting
   the static and dynamic processes arising from mechanical agitation using
   the voltage and current output signals of the TENG, respectively, with
   potential applications for touch pad and smart skin technologies. To
   enhance the performance of the TENG, besides the vast choices of
   materials in the triboelectric series, from polymer to metal and to
   fabric, the morphologies of their surfaces can be modified by physical
   techniques with the creation of pyramid-, square-, or hemisphere-based
   micro- or nanopatterns, which are effective for enhancing the contact
   area and possibly the triboelectrification. The surfaces of the
   materials can be functionalized chemically using various molecules,
   nanotubes, nanowires, or nanoparticles, in order to enhance the
   triboelectric effect. The contact materials can be composites, such as
   embedding nanoparticles in a polymer matrix, which may change not only
   the surface electrification but also the permittivity of the materials
   so that they can be effective for electrostatic induction. Therefore,
   there are numerous ways to enhance the performance of the TENG from the
   materials point of view. This gives an excellent opportunity for
   chemists and materials scientists to do extensive study both in the
   basic science and in practical applications. We anticipate that a better
   enhancement of the output power density will be achieved in the next few
   years. The TENG is possible not only for self-powered portable
   electronics but also as a new energy technology with potential to
   contribute to the world energy in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive models are beneficial tools for researchers to use in
   prioritizing nanoparticles (NPs) for toxicological tests, but
   experimental evaluation can be time-consuming and expensive, and thus,
   priority should be given to tests that identify the NPs most likely to
   be harmful. For characterization of NPs, the physical binding of NPs to
   DNA molecules is important to measure, as interference with DNA function
   may be one cause of toxicity. Here, we determined the interaction energy
   between 12 types of NPs and DNA based on the
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) model and then predicted the
   affinity of the NPs for DNA. Using the single-molecule imaging technique
   known as atomic force microscopy (AFM), we experimentally determined the
   binding affinity of those NPs for DNA. Theoretical predictions and
   experimental observations of the binding affinity agreed well.
   Furthermore, the effect of NPs on DNA replication in vitro was
   investigated with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The
   results showed that NPs with a high affinity for DNA strongly inhibited
   DNA replication, whereas NPs with low affinity had no or minimal effects
   on DNA replication. The methodology here is expected to benefit the
   genotoxicological testing of NPs as well as the design of safe NPs.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-based magnetic materials and structures of mesoscopic dimensions
   may offer unique opportunities for future
   nanomagnetoelectronic/spintronic devices. To achieve their potential,
   carbon nanosystems must have controllable magnetic properties. We
   demonstrate that nitrophenyl functionalized graphene can act as a
   room-temperature 2D magnet. We report a comprehensive study of
   low-temperature magnetotransport, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM),
   and superconducting quantum interference (SQUID) measurements before and
   after radical functionalization. Following nitrophenyl (NP)
   functionalization, epitaxially grown graphene systems can become organic
   molecular magnets with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering that
   persists at temperatures above 400 K. The field-dependent, surface
   magnetoelectric properties were studied using scanning probe microscopy
   (SPM) techniques. The results indicate that the NP-functionalization
   orientation and degree of coverage directly affect the magnetic
   properties of the graphene surface. In addition, graphene-based organic
   magnetic nanostructures were found to demonstrate a pronounced
   magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). The results were consistent across
   different characterization techniques and indicate room-temperature
   magnetic ordering along preferred graphene orientations in the
   NP-functionalized samples. Chemically isolated graphene nanoribbons
   (CINs) were observed along the preferred functionality directions. These
   results pave the way for future magnetoelectronic/spintronic
   applications based on promising concepts such as current-induced
   magnetization switching, magnetoelectricity, half-metallicity, and
   quantum tunneling of magnetization.}},

Abstract = {{An unstable mechanical structure that can self-balance when perturbed is
   a superior choice for vibration energy harvesting and vibration
   detection. In this work, a suspended 3D spiral structure is integrated

   TENG has a wide working bandwidth of 30 Hz in low-frequency range with a
   maximum output power density of 2.76 W/m(2) on a load of 6 M ohm. The
   position of an in-plane vibration source was identified by placing TENGs
   at multiple positions as multichannel, self-powered active sensors, and
   the location of the vibration source was determined with an error less
   than 6\%. The magnitude of the vibration is also measured by the output
   voltage and current signal of the TENG. By integrating the TENG inside a
   buoy ball, wave energy harvesting at water surface has been demonstrated
   and used for lighting illumination light, which shows great potential

   discuss a number of important concepts involved in galvanic replacement,
   including the facet selectivity involved in the dissolution and
   deposition of metals, the impacts of alloying and dealloying on the
   structure and morphology of the final products, and methods for
   promoting or preventing a galvanic replacement reaction. We also
   illustrate how the capability of galvanic replacement can be enhanced to
   fabricate nanomaterials with complex structures and/or compositions by
   coupling with other processes such as co-reduction and the Kirkendall
   effect. Finally, we highlight the use of such novel metal nanostructures
   fabricated via galvanic replacement for applications ranging from
   catalysis to plasmonics and biomedical research, and conclude with
   remarks on prospective future directions.}},

Abstract = {{An increased level of harmonics due to the proliferation of single-phase
   nonlinear loads is raising serious concerns among utilities.
   Historically, passive filters have been proposed to reduce harmonics in
   medium-voltage (MV) utility applications. However, due to their
   limitations, utilities are turning their attention to alternative
   solutions. At the same time, active filters are prohibitively expensive
   and are unlikely to become a realistic solution in the near future. In
   this paper, a practical directional third harmonic hybrid active filter
   is proposed. A novel feature that adjusts the level of compensation
   provided by the filter based on the loading conditions of its passive
   components is introduced. Simulation and experimental results are
   presented. Issues related to utilizing existing VAr support capacitors
   for retrofit applications thereby achieving cost reduction and fail
   normal feature for increased reliability are addressed. Cost versus
   performance curves are developed using factual utility harmonic data.
   Finally, the impact of a distributed filtering solution based on the
   proposed filter is shown using a simplified MV distribution system.}},

Abstract = {{A large-signal, transient model has been developed to predict the output
   characteristics of a CMUT array operated in the non-collapse mode. The
   model is based on separation of the nonlinear electrostatic
   voltage-to-force relation and the linear acoustic array response. For
   modeling of linear acoustic radiation and crosstalk effects, the
   boundary element method is used. The stiffness matrix in the
   vibroacoustics calculations is obtained using static finite element
   analysis of a single membrane which can have arbitrary geometry and
   boundary conditions. A lumped modeling approach is used to reduce the
   order of the system for modeling the transient nonlinear electrostatic
   actuation. To accurately capture the dynamics of the non-uniform
   electrostatic force distribution over the CMUT electrode during large
   deflections, the membrane electrode is divided into patches shaped to
   match higher order membrane modes, each introducing a variable to the
   system model. This reduced order nonlinear lumped model is solved in the
   time domain using commercial software. The model has two linear blocks
   to calculate the displacement profile of the electrode patches and the
   output pressure for a given force distribution over the array. The
   force-to-array-displacement block uses the linear acoustic model, and
   the Rayleigh integral is evaluated to calculate the pressure at any
   field point. Using the model, the time-domain transmitted pressure can
   be simulated for different large drive signal configurations. The
   acoustic model is verified by comparison to harmonic FEA in vacuum and
   fluid for high-and low-aspect-ratio membranes as well as mass-loaded
   membranes. The overall software model is verified by comparison to
   transient 3-D finite element analysis and experimental results for
   different large drive signals, and an example for a phased array
   simulation is given.}},

Abstract = {{Since aging is an inevitable phenomenon during storage of a radial lip

   to predict the equivalent material properties at any storage
   temperature. The material property parameters of aged rubber samples are
   measured in a uniaxial compression experiment. The pumping rate and
   friction torque of the seal are calculated through numerical simulation
   by using a mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) model. A bench
   test is used to verify the aging life prediction model and the
   simulation results of the EHL model. Finally, the verified EHL model is
   used to study how aging during storage affects the lip seal performance,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and
   titanium-aluminum-vanadium (titanium alloy) are used frequently in
   lumbar spine interbody fusion. Osteoblasts cultured on microstructured
   titanium generate an environment characterized by increased angiogenic
   factors and factors that inhibit osteoclast activity mediated by
   integrin alpha(2)beta(1) signaling. It is not known if this is also true
   of osteoblasts on titanium alloy or PEEK.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if osteoblasts
   generate an environment that supports angiogenesis and reduces
   osteoclastic activity when grown on smooth titanium alloy, rough
   titanium alloy, or PEEK.
   STUDY DESIGN: This in vitro study compared angiogenic factor production
   and integrin gene expression of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells
   cultured on PEEK or titanium-aluminum-vanadium (titanium alloy).
   METHODS: MG63 cells were grown on PEEK, smooth titanium alloy, or
   through titanium alloy. Osteogenic microenvironment was characterized by
   secretion of osteoprotegerin and transforming growth factor beta-1
   (TGF-beta 1), which inhibit osteoclast activity and angiogenic factors
   including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), fibroblast
   growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1). Expression of
   integrins, transmembrane extracellular matrix recognition proteins, was
   measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   RESULTS: Culture on titanium alloy stimulated osteoprotegerin, TGF-beta
   1, VEGF-A, FGF-2, and angiopoietin-1 production, and levels were greater
   on rough titanium alloy than on smooth titanium alloy. All factors
   measured were significantly lower on PEEK than on smooth or rough
   titanium alloy. Culture on titanium alloy stimulated expression of
   messenger RNA for integrins that recognize Type I collagen in comparison
   with PEEK.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rough titanium alloy stimulated cells to create an
   osteogenic-angiogenic microenvironment. The osteogenic-angiogenic
   responses to titanium alloy were greater than PEEK and greater on rough
   titanium alloy than on smooth titanium alloy. Surface features regulated
   expression of integrins important in collagen recognition. These factors
   may increase bone formation, enhance integration, and improve implant
   stability in interbody spinal fusions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The Fontan surgical procedure used for treating patients with single
   ventricle congenital heart disorders results in a total cavopulmonary
   connection (TCPC) of the vena cavae to the pulmonary arteries (PAs).
   Sluggish TCPC flow and elevated hepatic venous pressures are commonly
   observed in this altered physiology, which in turn can lead to long-term
   complications including liver congestion and cirrhosis. The hypothesis
   of this study is that placement of a unidirectional valve within the
   inferior vena cava (IVC) will improve hemodynamics of the Fontan
   circulation by preventing retrograde flow and lowering hepatic venous
   pressure. An in vitro experimental setup consisting of an idealized TCPC
   model with flexible walls was used for investigation, and a bovine
   venous valve was inserted in the IVC below the TCPC. Pressure
   fluctuations were introduced in the flow through the model to simulate
   venous pulsatility. Hemodynamics of baseline and valve-implanted
   conditions were compared across total caval flows ranging from 1.0 to
   2.5 l/min with varying caval flow distributions. The results indicated
   that valve closure occurred for 15-20\% of the total cycle, with
   consequent reduction in the upstream hepatic venous pressure by 5 to 10
   mmHg. Energy loss (EL) through the TCPC was lowered with valve
   implantation to 20-50\% of baseline, occurring across all flow
   conditions considered with mean caval and PA pressures greater than 10
   mmHg. The results of this in vitro modeling suggest that IVC valve
   placement has the potential to improve hemodynamics in the Fontan
   circulation by decreasing hepatic venous hypertension and EL.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have studied the impact of epilayer strain on the deposition
   of InAs/GaAs on (100) and (111)B with 2 degrees offset toward < 2-1-1 >
   surfaces. Consequences of a 7\% lattice mismatch between these
   orientations in the form of three-dimensional growth are less apparent
   for (111) B with 2 degrees offset toward < 2-1-1 > surfaces compared to
   (100). By exploring a range of molecular beam epitaxy process parameters
   for InAs/GaAs growth and utilizing scanning electron microscopy, atomic
   force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the quality of
   these strained layers, the authors develop empirical models that
   describe the influence of the process conditions in regards to surface
   roughness with >92\% accuracy. The smoothest InAs/GaAs samples
   demonstrated average surface roughness of 0.08 nm for 10 mu m(2) areas,
   albeit at very low deposition rates. The authors have found the most
   important process conditions to be substrate temperature and deposition
   rate, leading us to believe that controlling diffusion length may be the
   key to reducing defects in severely strained structures. InGaAs/AlGaAs
   quantum cascade laser structures were also produced on (111)B with 2
   degrees offset toward < 2-1-1 > to take advantage of the piezoelectric
   effect, and the modified laser transitions due to these effects were
   observed. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Multibeam interference lithography (MBIL) represents a versatile,
   wafer-scale, rapid, and cost-effective fabrication technique for
   periodic-based microstructures. However, integrating arbitrary and
   nonperiodic functional elements within an MBIL-defined lattice typically
   requires an additional time-consuming step. To address this issue, the
   authors recently introduced pattern-integrated interference lithography
   (PIIL) that couples MBIL and imaging lithography simultaneously. In this
   work, the authors present a comprehensive multibeam
   high-numerical-aperture (NA) vector volume interference/image model for
   PIIL. This model accounts for the vector nature of light in a high-NA
   PIIL implementation, the beam propagation within a photoresist film, and
   the influence of the beam amplitudes and polarizations on the
   interference pattern. Using this model, PIIL capabilities are
   illustrated through examples of pattern-integrated one-, two-, and

   5 nm of the bottom surface of the BCP film. Also, pitch subdivision

   roughness more easily than pitch replicating patterns where a guiding

Abstract = {{A comprehensive investigation was carried out on n-type ZnO nanowires
   for studying the temperature dependence of the piezotronic effect from
   77 to 300 K. In general, lowering the temperature results in a largely
   enhanced piezotronic effect. The experimental results show that the
   behaviors can be divided into three groups depending on the carrier
   doping level or conductivity of the ZnO nanowires. For nanowires with a
   low carrier density (<10(17)/cm(3) at 77 K), the pieozotronic effect is
   dominant at low temperature for dictating the transport properties of
   the nanowires; an opposite change of Schottky barrier heights at the two
   contacts as a function of temperature at a fixed strain was observed for
   the first time. At a moderate doping (between 10(17)/cm(3) and
   10(18)/cm(3) at 77 K), the piezotronic effect is only dominant at one
   contact, because the screening effect of the carriers to the positive
   piezoelectric polarization charges at the other end (for n-type
   semiconductors). For nanowires with a high density of carriers
   (>10(18)/cm(3) at 77 K), the piezotronic effect almost vanishes. This
   study not only proves the proposed fundamental mechanism of piezotronic
   effect, but also provides guidance for fabricating piezotronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The low-energy quasiparticles in graphene can be described by a
   Dirac-Weyl Hamiltonian for massless fermions, hence graphene has been
   proposed to be an effective medium to study exotic phenomena originally

   Zitterbewegung. In this work, we show that another important
   particle-physics phenomenon, the neutrino oscillation, can be studied
   and observed in a particular graphene system, namely, twisted bilayer
   graphene. It has been found that graphene layers grown epitaxially on
   SiC or by the chemical vapor deposition method on metal substrates
   display a stacking pattern with adjacent layers rotated by an angle with
   respect to each other. The quasiparticle states in two distinct graphene
   layers act as neutrinos with two flavors, and the interlayer interaction
   between them induces an appreciable coupling between these two
   ``flavors{''} of massless fermions, leading to neutrino-like
   oscillations. In addition, our calculation shows that anisotropic
   transport properties manifest in a specific energy window, which is
   accessible experimentally in twisted bilayer graphene. Combining two
   graphene layers enables us to probe the rich physics involving multiple
   interacting Dirac fermions.}},

Abstract = {{The irreversible chemomechanical degradation is a critical issue in the
   development of high-capacity electrode materials for the next-generation
   lithium (Li)-ion batteries. Here we report the self-healing behavior of
   gallium nanodroplets (GaNDs) under electrochemical cycling at room
   temperature, observed with in situ transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). During lithiation, the GaNDs underwent a liquid-to-solid phase
   transition, forming a crystalline phase (LixGa) with similar to 160\%
   volume expansion. Owing to the uneven Li flow during lithiation, the
   fully lithiated GaNDs exhibited highly distorted morphologies. Upon
   delithiation, the reverse phase transition occurred, accompanied with
   the nucleation and growth of a nanosized void. After the GaNDs were
   fully delithiated, the nanovoid gradually annihilated. Our analysis,
   along with phase field modeling and experimental measurements of the
   void growth and annihilation, provides mechanistic insights into the
   void formation and annihilation mechanism. The GaNDs may function as an
   effective healing agent in durable composite electrodes for
   high-performance Li-ion batteries, wherein active components, such as
   Si, are susceptible to fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) antennas are ideal for handheld sensing
   applications, such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for landmine
   detection, because of their small size, efficiency, and directivity.
   Increased detection performance has been shown when a GPR is combined
   with a metal detector, but a typical EBG antenna would preclude the
   sensors from being colocated because of the large amount of metal in the
   EBG structure. An EBG composed of very thin metal is proposed in this
   letter for application as a GPR colocated with a metal detector, without
   causing a significant self-response in the metal detector. Manufacturing
   methods are discussed, and GPR measurements are shown from the
   thin-metal EBG antennas. The metal detector response from a thin metal
   sheet is discussed, and measurements of the EBG ground planes are shown
   using a laboratory wideband electromagnetic induction system. The
   response from the thin metal is shown to be as low as three orders of
   magnitude less than from a copper sheet at typical metal detector
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{We are presenting a new wireless and wearable human computer interface
   called the dual-mode Tongue Drive System (dTDS), which is designed to

   using a magnetic tracer and an array of magnetic sensors embedded in a
   compact and ergonomic wireless headset. It also captures the users'
   voice wirelessly using a small microphone embedded in the same headset.
   Preliminary evaluation results based on 14 able-bodied subjects and
   three individuals with high level spinal cord injuries at level C3-C5
   indicated that the dTDS headset, combined with a commercially available
   speech recognition (SR) software, can provide end users with

   that classifying cell-edge users and cell-center users is critical.
   Thus, we develop low-complexity decentralized SFR scheduling algorithms
   that include optimal user classification and balance throughput and
   fairness among multiusers. We also propose suboptimal methods to reduce
   computational complexity. Computer simulation demonstrates that gains of
   the proposed SFR algorithm can improve the fifth percentile user

Abstract = {{The ability to precisely modify endogenous genes can significantly
   facilitate biological studies and disease treatment, and the clustered
   regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems have
   the potential to be powerful tools for genome engineering. However, the
   target specificity of CRISPR systems is largely unknown. Here we
   demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 systems targeting the human hemoglobin beta
   and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 genes have substantial off-target
   cleavage, especially within the hemoglobin delta and C-C chemokine
   receptor type 2 genes, respectively, causing gross chromosomal
   deletions. The guide strands of the CRISPR/Cas9 systems were designed to
   have a range of mismatches with the sequences of potential off-target
   sites. Off-target analysis was performed using the T7 endonuclease I
   mutation detection assay and Sanger sequencing. We found that the repair
   of the on-and off-target cleavage resulted in a wide variety of
   insertions, deletions and point mutations. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9
   systems need to be carefully designed to avoid potential off-target
   cleavage sites, including those with mismatches to the 12-bases proximal
   to the guide strand protospacer-adjacent motif.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless NanoSensor Networks (WNSNs), i.e., networks of nanoscale
   devices with unprecedented sensing capabilities, are the enabling
   technology of long-awaited applications such as advanced health
   monitoring systems or surveillance networks for chemical and biological

   extreme energy limitations of nanosensors, which require the use of
   nanoscale energy harvesting systems, introduce major challenges in the

   fair, throughput and lifetime optimal channel access by jointly
   optimizing the energy harvesting and consumption processes in
   nanosensors. Towards this end, the critical packet transmission ratio
   (CTR) is derived, which is the maximum allowable ratio between the
   transmission time and the energy harvesting time, below which a
   nanosensor can harvest more energy than the consumed one, thus achieving
   perpetual data transmission. Based on the CTR, first, a novel
   symbol-compression scheduling algorithm, built on a recently proposed
   pulse-based physical layer technique, is introduced. The
   symbol-compression solution utilizes the unique elasticity of the
   inter-symbol spacing of the pulse-based physical layer to allow a large
   number of nanosensors to transmit their packets in parallel without
   inducing collisions. In addition, a packet-level timeline scheduling
   algorithm, built on a theoretical bandwidth-adaptive capacity-optimal
   physical layer, is proposed with an objective to achieve balanced
   single-user throughput with infinite network lifetime. The simulation
   results show that the proposed simple scheduling algorithms can enable
   nanosensors to transmit with extremely high speed perpetually without
   replacing the batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the composition and fermentability of hydrolysate prepared from AFEX
   (TM) (Ammonia Fiber Expansion - a trademark of MBI, Lansing, MI)
   pretreated corn stover were investigated. Precipitates formed during
   hydrolysate storage increased with increasing storage pH and time. The
   precipitate amount was the least when hydrolysate was stored at 4
   degrees C and pH 4.8, accounting for only 0.02\% of the total
   hydrolysate weight after 3-month storage. No significant changes of NMR
   (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra and concentrations of sugars,
   minerals and heavy metals were observed after storage under this
   condition. When pH was adjusted higher before fermentation, precipitates
   also formed, consisting of mostly struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O)
   and brushite (CaHPO4 center dot 2H(2)O). Escherichia coli and
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation studies and yeast cell growth
   assays showed no significant difference in fermentability between fresh

Abstract = {{A three-chambered membrane bio-chemical reactor (TC-MBCR) was developed.
   The stainless steel membrane modules were used as cathodes and iron
   plates in the middle chamber served as the anode. The TC-MBCR was able
   to reduce fouling, remove triclosan (TCS) from a synthetic wastewater
   treatment and enhance electricity generation by similar to 60\% compared
   with the cell voltage before TCS addition. The TC-MBCR system generated
   a relatively stable power output (cell voltage similar to 0.2 V) and the
   corrosion of iron plates contributed to electricity generation together
   with microbes on iron anode. The permeation flow from anode to cathode
   chamber was considered important in electricity generation. In addition,
   the negatively charged cathode membrane and Fe2+/Fe3+ released by iron
   plates mitigated membrane fouling by approximately 30\%, as compared
   with the control. The removal of COD and total phosphorus was
   approximately 99\% and 90\%. The highest triclosan removal rate reached
   97.9\%. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable efforts have been directed at identifying prognostic
   markers for rapidly progressing coronary atherosclerotic lesions that
   may advance into a high-risk (vulnerable) state. Intravascular
   ultrasound (IVUS) has become a valuable clinical tool to study the
   natural history of coronary artery disease (CAD). While prospectively
   IVUS studies have provided tremendous insight on CAD progression, and
   its association with independent markers (e. g., wall shear stress),
   they are limited by the inability to examine the focal association
   between spatially heterogeneous variables (in both circumferential and
   axial directions). Herein, we present a framework to automatically
   co-register longitudinal (in-time) virtual histology-intravascular
   ultrasound (VH-IVUS) imaging data in the circumferential direction
   (i.e., rotate follow-up image so circumferential basis coincides with
   corresponding baseline image). Multivariate normalized cross correlation
   was performed on paired images (n = 636) from five patients using three
   independent VH-IVUS defined parameters: artery thickness, VH-IVUS
   defined plaque constituents, and VH-IVUS perivascular imaging data.
   Results exhibited high correlation between co-registration rotation
   angles determined automatically versus manually by an expert reader
   (r(2) = 0.90). Furthermore, no significant difference between automatic
   and manual co-registration angles was observed (91.31 +/- 1.04 degrees
   and 91.07 +/- 1.04 degrees, respectively;) p = 0.48 and Bland-Altman
   analysis yielded excellent agreement (bias = 0.24 degrees, 95\% CI +/ -
   16.33 degrees). In conclusion, we have developed, verified, and
   validated an algorithm that automatically co-registers VH-IVUS imaging
   data that will allow for the focal examination of CAD progression.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of injured or unusual anatomic structures in medical
   imagery is a problem that has continued to elude fully automated
   solutions. In this paper, the goal of easy-to-use and consistent
   interactive segmentation is transformed into a control synthesis
   problem. A nominal level set partial differential equation (PDE) is
   assumed to be given; this open-loop system achieves correct segmentation
   under ideal conditions, but does not agree with a human expert's ideal
   boundary for real image data. Perturbing the state and dynamics of a
   level set PDE via the accumulated user input and an observer-like system
   leads to desirable closed-loop behavior. The input structure is designed
   such that a user can stabilize the boundary in some desired state
   without needing to understand any mathematical parameters. Effectiveness
   of the technique is illustrated with applications to the challenging
   segmentations of a patellar tendon in magnetic resonance and a shattered
   femur in computed tomography.}},

   3 and 5 wt\% GNP compared with the neat polymer Morphological
   observation of the graphite-coated PA powder showed fairly homogeneous
   dispersion. The SLS processed parts were nearly fully dense and the
   highest density (99.5\%) was found at 3 wt\% GNP The bulk electrical

Abstract = {{We present a postprocessing algorithm for 5-axis machines, which can be
   applied to types with two rotary axes (2R-3L) and three rotary axes
   (3R-2L). Five-axis machining requires a postprocessor for converting
   cutter-location (CL) data to numerical-control (NC) data. The existing
   methods for postprocessing use inverse kinematics equations from the
   forward kinematics. However, for 5-axis machines with three rotary axes,
   the inverse kinematics equations cannot be induced directly, because the
   forward kinematics equations are coupled To derive the joint values from
   the forward kinematics equations, previous algorithms use iterative
   numerical methods for the postprocessing; this requires a search
   algorithm with much computation time and may fail to obtain a solution.
   Our algorithm has three advantages first, the forward kinematics
   equations are not required; second, the method is reliable and
   eliminates the need for numerical methods for the inverse kinematics,
   which results in exact solutions; and finally, the proposed algorithm is
   generic for 5-axis machines, which can also be applied to 2R-3L 5-axis
   machines.}},

Title = {{A geometric approach to joint inversion with applications to contaminant
   source zone characterization}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new joint inversion approach to shape-based
   inverse problems. Given two sets of data from distinct physical models,
   the main objective is to obtain a unified characterization of inclusions
   within the spatial domain of the physical properties to be
   reconstructed. Although our proposed method generally applies to many
   types of inverse problems, the main motivation here is to characterize
   subsurface contaminant source zones by processing down-gradient
   hydrological data and cross-gradient electrical resistance tomography
   observations. Inspired by Newton's method for multiobjective
   optimization, we present an iterative inversion scheme in which descent
   steps are chosen to simultaneously reduce both data-model misfit terms.
   Such an approach, however, requires solving a non-smooth convex problem
   at every iteration, which is computationally expensive for a pixel-based
   inversion over the whole domain. Instead, we employ a parametric level
   set technique that substantially reduces the number of underlying
   parameters, making the inversion computationally tractable. The
   performance of the technique is examined and discussed through the
   reconstruction of source zone architectures that are representative of
   dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminant release in a
   statistically homogenous sandy aquifer. In these examples, the geometric
   configuration of the DNAPL mass is considered along with additional
   information about its spatial variability within the contaminated zone,
   such as the identification of low and high saturation regions.
   Comparison of the reconstructions with the true DNAPL architectures
   highlights the superior performance of the model-based technique and
   joint inversion scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We report microfabricated toroidal inductors with nanolaminated
   ferromagnetic metallic cores for chip-scale, high-power switching
   converters. The fabrication process of the toroidal inductor is based on
   individual manufacturing of partial windings (i.e. bottom and vertical
   conductors) and nanolaminated magnetic core, and integrating them by
   means of a drop-in approach. The nanolaminated ferromagnetic metallic
   cores presented in this paper consist of many multilayers of
   electrodeposited CoNiFe films, each layer with sub-micron thickness,
   with a total core thickness exceeding tens of microns. The beneficial
   magnetic properties (i.e. high saturation flux density and low
   coercivity) of CoNiFe alloys are well suited for chip-scale inductors as
   they achieve both large energy storage capacity as well as minimized
   volumetric core losses at high operating frequencies due to their
   nanolaminated structure. A drop-in integration approach, introduced to
   combine the microfabricated toroidal inductor windings with the magnetic
   cores, allows ease of integration. An advantage of this hybrid approach
   over monolithic fabrication in this application is the potential use of
   a wide variety of core materials, both microfabricated and
   bulk-fabricated, and which may or may not ultimately be CMOS-compatible.
   Exploiting this drop-in approach, 30-turn- and 50-turn-toroidal
   inductors integrated with nanolaminated CoNiFe cores, having 10 mm outer
   diameter and 1 mm thickness, have been successfully developed. Both
   types of inductors exhibit inductances higher than 1 mu H at frequencies
   up to tens of MHz, showing ten times the inductance of an air core
   device with the same nominal geometry. The peak quality factor of the
   30-turn-toroidal inductor reaches 18 at 1 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{The percolation threshold in a composite depends on the processing
   conditions used to fabricate it along with the size and shape of the
   filler and the matrix. In this study, borosilicate glass microspheres
   were used as the matrix material, and nanosized antimony tin oxide (ATO)
   particles were used as the filler. The glass microsphere/ATO composites
   were fabricated by hot pressing at temperatures in the range between the
   glass transition temperature and the softening temperature of the glass
   to control the viscosity. The pressure and temperature applied allowed
   the ATO to be confined to the spaces between certain glass particles,
   forming percolating networks at low volume fractions of the ATO. The
   viscous flow of the glass allowed for the composite to have near full
   densities, while allowing for the nanoparticle segregation to occur.
   Even though apparently similar microstructures were made using different
   heating schedules, the percolation behavior and electrical conductivity
   showed noticeable differences. The percolation threshold ranged from 0.1
   to 2.5phr (parts per hundred glass) and the change in electrical
   conductivity was around seven to nine orders of magnitude. The
   differences were attributed to the interaction of the segregated ATO
   particles with one another. The electrical properties were examined
   using ac impedance spectroscopy along with current atomic force
   microscopy (C-AFM), which allowed for valuable insights in the
   structure-property-processing relationships in these materials.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{542-559}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Deterministic air traffic flow management (TFM) decisions the state of
   the art in terms of implementation often result in unused airspace
   capacity. This is because the inherent uncertainties in weather
   predictions make it difficult to determine the number of aircraft that
   can be safely accommodated in a region of airspace during a given
   period. On the other hand, stochastic TFM algorithms are not amenable to
   implementation in practice due to the lack of valid stochastic mappings
   between weather forecasts and airspace capacity to serve as inputs to
   these algorithms. To fill this gap, we develop a fast simulation-based
   methodology to determine the stochastic capacity of a region of airspace
   using integrated weather-traffic models. The developed methodology
   consists of combining ensemble weather forecast information with an air
   traffic control algorithm to generate capacity maps over time. We
   demonstrate the overall methodology through a novel conflict resolution
   procedure and a simple weather scenario generation tool, and also
   discuss the potential use of ensemble weather forecasts. An operational
   study based on comparisons of the generated capacity distributions with
   observed impacts of weather events on air traffic is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Gram-positive bacteria are widely used to produce recombinant proteins,
   amino acids, organic acids, higher alcohols, and polymers. Many proteins
   have been expressed in Gram-positive hosts such as Corynebacterium,
   Brevibacterium, and Streptomyces. The favorable and advantageous
   characteristics (e.g., high secretion capacity and efficient production
   of metabolic products) of these species have increased the
   biotechnological applications of bacteria. However, owing to
   multiplicity from genes encoding the proteins and expression hosts, the
   expression of recombinant proteins is limited in Gram-positive bacteria.
   Because there is a very recent review about protein expression in
   Bacillus subtilis, here we summarize recent strategies for efficient
   expression of recombinant proteins in the other three typical
   Gram-positive bacteria (Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, and
   Streptomyces) and discuss future prospects. We hope that this review
   will contribute to the development of recombinant protein expression in
   Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, and Streptomyces.}},

Title = {{Multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty in building performance
   assessment}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Building performance assessment is complex, as it has to respond to
   multiple criteria. Objectives originating from the demands that are put
   on energy consumption, acoustical performance, thermal occupant comfort,
   indoor air quality and many other issues must all be reconciled. An
   assessment requires the use of predictive models that involve numerous
   design and physical parameters as their inputs. Since these input
   parameters, as well as the models that operate on them, are not
   precisely known, it is imprudent to assume deterministic values for
   them. A more realistic approach is to introduce ranges of uncertainty in
   the parameters themselves, or in their derivation, from underlying
   approximations. In so doing, it is recognized that the outcome of a
   performance assessment is influenced by many sources of uncertainty. As
   a consequence of this approach the design process is informed by
   assessment outcomes that produce probability distributions of a target
   measure instead of its deterministic value. In practice this may lead to
   a ``well informed{''} analysis but not necessarily to a straightforward,
   cost effective and efficient design process.
   This paper discusses how design decision making can be based on
   uncertainty assessments. A case study is described focussing on a
   discrete decision that involves a choice between two HVAC system
   designs. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) including uncertainty
   information is used to arrive at a rational decision. In this approach,
   key performance indicators such as energy efficiency, thermal comfort
   and others are ranked according to their importance and preferences.
   This process enables a clear group consensus based choice of one of the
   two options. The research presents a viable means of collaboratively
   ranking complex design options based on stakeholder's preferences and
   considering the uncertainty involved in the designs. In so doing it
   provides important feedback to the design team. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The islanding detection is one of the most important issues for
   grid-connection of the distributed generation (DG) systems. Several
   recent researches have developed two types of islanding detection
   methods (IDMs) with high-performance. One is the power and voltage (P-V)
   characteristic of load based IDM, and the other is the inverter's
   switching frequency based IDM. Although the above IDMs have no
   non-detection zone (NDZ) theoretically, their usefulness mainly depends
   on the control performance of the inverter in practice. In other words,
   the inverter must achieve the decoupled real and reactive control and
   successful operation of phase-locked loop (PLL). To deal with these
   problems, this paper describes the design of inverter controller to
   improve both system stability and islanding detection performance with
   the NDZ. The proposed controller uses the magnitude and phase of
   measured voltage directly instead of using the direct and quadrature
   axes voltages and currents. Additionally, it does not need an instant
   phase of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage, which is required in
   the conventional controller, and therefore makes it possible for the PLL
   independent control. Several case studies are carried out to verify that
   the proposed controller has better performance than the conventional
   controller.}},

   that frequency synchronization corresponds to convergence to an
   equilibrium of these models. We derive a necessary condition for
   existence of such equilibria, and determine a simple test for their
   local stability. Finally, we introduce a sufficient condition for
   frequency synchronization of such networks, and show that it consists of
   a set of local criteria which can each be determined from local

Abstract = {{The paper presents a distributed algorithm that regulates the power
   outputs of multiple dispersed energy storage systems (DESS), which can
   be used to provide desirable services for power systems, such as
   renewable generation output smoothing and secondary control. The
   algorithm is based on the cooperative control principle of network
   control theory and it satisfies both the power balance requirement of
   power systems and the fair utilization among the DESS. The most distinct
   feature of the algorithm is that each DESS only requires the information
   from its neighbors through some local communication networks (CN),
   utilizing a virtual leader embedded in one or several DESS to receive a
   power command signal. In addition, to improve the robustness of the CN
   among DESS, two optimization models are formulated to design the
   so-called ``N - 1{''} redundant network, while considering both economic
   issues and convergence rate. These features enable the DESS under the
   algorithm to have both self-organizing and adaptive coordination
   properties under some adverse conditions. Simulation on the IEEE 123-bus
   distribution system validates the effectiveness of the proposed

Pages = {{23-30}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics and conjugate heat transfer in porous media subject to
   unidirectional-steady state as well as steady-periodic flow conditions
   were numerically studied. Two-dimensional flows in porous media composed
   of periodically configured arrays of square cylinders were simulated
   using a computational fluid dynamics tool, with sinusoidal time
   variation of inlet and exit boundaries and conjugate heat transfer
   between the solid and fluid domains. The simulated domain contained
   seven unit cells, with each unit cell representing a square cylinder.
   Simulations showed that the end effects did not persist more than two
   unit cells. Simulations were conducted for flow oscillation frequencies
   of 0-60 Hz, and low and high velocity amplitudes (representing tidal
   fluid penetration amplitudes of 8 and 2 times the hydraulic diameter,
   respectively, at inlet) for a 75\% porous domain. Using the simulation
   results, pore-scale volume-average Darcy permeability, Forchheimer
   coefficient, and Nusselt number associated with the standard
   volume-average porous media momentum and thermal energy equations were
   calculated. These parameters were calculated in instantaneous as well as
   cycle-averaged forms. The Forchheimer coefficient and Nusselt number
   were significantly different in unidirectional-steady and oscillatory
   flow conditions. These parameters strongly depend on the flow
   oscillation frequency and amplitude. Furthermore, significant phase lag
   occurs among velocity, pressure, temperature and heat transfer
   processes. The results confirm that unidirectional-steady flow models
   and correlations are not suitable for applications involving flow
   oscillations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, electrical-thermal modeling of through-silicon via (TSV)

   temperature estimation for a 3D system, cascadic multigrid method is
   employed using an initial guess obtained by simulation using equivalent
   thermal conductivity to represent critical regions. By considering the
   thermal effect on electrical conductivities of TSV conductor and silicon
   substrate, the electrical-thermal modeling of TSV array in the
   interposer is carried out using cylindrical modal basis functions. The
   temperature effect on TSV insertion loss, crosstalk, and RLCG parameters
   are discussed with examples along with correlation with measurements.

Title = {{Blast Response of a Sandwich Beam/Wide Plate Based on the Extended

Abstract = {{This paper presents a one-dimensional analysis for the blast response of
   a sandwich beam/wide plate with a compressible core. The dynamic version
   of the recently developed extended high-order sandwich panel theory
   (EHSAPT) is first formulated. Material, geometric, and loading
   parameters are taken from blast experiments reported in literature. The
   novelty of EHSAPT is that it includes axial rigidity of the core and
   allows for three generalized coordinates in the core (the axial and
   transverse displacements at the centroid of the core and the rotation at
   the centroid of the core) instead of just one (shear stress in the core)
   of the earlier high-order sandwich panel theory (HSAPT). The solution
   procedure to determine the dynamic response to a general load applied on
   the top face sheet of a general asymmetric simply supported
   configuration is outlined. Although the dynamic EHSAPT is formulated in
   its full nonlinear version, the solution is for the linear problem so
   the accuracy of EHSAPT, along with the other theories, can be assessed
   by comparison to an available dynamic elasticity solution. Results show
   that the EHSAPT is very accurate and can capture the complex dynamic
   phenomena observed during the initial, transient phase of blast loading.}},

Title = {{Rotordynamic Crack Diagnosis: Distinguishing Crack Depth and Location}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to establish simple condition monitoring
   principles for diagnosing the depth and location of transverse fatigue
   cracks in a rotordynamic system. The success of an on-line crack
   diagnosis regimen hinges on the accuracy of the crack model, which
   should account for the crack's depth and location. Two gaping crack
   models are presented; the first emulates a finite-width notch typically
   manufactured for experimental purposes, while the second models a gaping
   fatigue crack. The rotordynamic model used herein is based upon an
   available overhung rotordynamic test rig that was originally constructed
   to monitor the dynamics of a mechanical face seal. Four
   degree-of-freedom, linear equations of motion for both crack models are
   presented and discussed. Free and forced response analyses are
   presented, emphasizing results applicable to condition monitoring and,
   particularly, to diagnosing the crack parameters. The results
   demonstrate that two identifiers are required to diagnose the crack
   parameters: the 2X resonance shaft speed and the magnitude of the
   angular 2X subharmonic resonance. First, a contour plot of the 2X
   resonance shaft speed versus crack depth and location is generated. The
   magnitude of the 2X resonance along the desired 2X frequency contour is
   then obtained, narrowing the possible pairs of crack location and depth
   to either one or two possibilities. Practical aspects of the suggested
   diagnostic procedure are discussed, as well as qualitative observations
   concerning crack detection.}},

Title = {{Cyclic flame propagation in premixed combustion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{735}},
Pages = {{176-202}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In experiments of hot surface ignition and subsequent flame propagation,
   a puffing flame instability is observed in mixtures that are stagnant
   and premixed prior to ignition. By varying the size of the hot surface,
   power input, and combustion vessel volume, it was determined that the
   instability is a function of the interaction of the flame, with the
   fluid flow induced by the combustion products rather than the initial
   plume established by the hot surface. Pressure ranges from 25 to 100 kPa
   and mixtures of n-hexane/air with equivalence ratios between phi = 0.58
   and 3.0 at room temperature were investigated. Equivalence ratios
   between phi = 2.15 and 2.5 exhibited multiple flame and equivalence
   ratios above phi = 2.5 resulted in puffing flames at atmospheric
   pressure. The phenomenon is accurately reproduced in numerical
   simulations and a detailed flow field analysis revealed competition
   between the inflow velocity at the base of the flame and the flame
   propagation speed. The increasing inflow velocity, which exceeds the
   flame propagation speed, is ultimately responsible for creating a puff.
   The puff is then accelerated upward, allowing for the creation of the
   subsequent instabilities. The frequency of the puff is proportional to
   the gravitational acceleration and inversely proportional to the flame
   speed. A scaling relationship describes the dependence of the frequency
   on gravitational acceleration, hot surface diameter, and flame speed.
   This relation shows good agreement for rich n-hexane/air and lean
   hydrogen/air flames, as well as lean hexane/hydrogen/air mixtures.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Modelling and simulation environments that are stochastic in nature
   present a multitude of problems in the creation of meta-models, notably
   the reduction of the quality of fit due to statistical error. This
   report addresses this issue by first determining the minimum number of
   repetitions required for interval estimates to hold true regardless of
   interval width. These intervals are then used for meta-model
   regressions. Four measures were examined. Sample mean and variance
   interval coverage accuracy was studied by varying skewness, kurtosis,
   desired coverage, and sample size within the Pearson family of
   distributions. Binomial proportion and quantile interval coverage
   accuracy was studied with the standard normal with varying sample size,
   desired coverage, and quantile level. Finally, heuristic measures to
   determine how repetitions are related to the quality of the meta-model
   fit were developed based on the experimentation with a canonical
   problem. The ratio of confidence interval width to the range of sample
   measures was found to be an indicator of the impact of statistical error
   on the quality of model fit. Regression methods of weighted least
   squares (WLS), ordinary least squares for constant sample sizes, and
   constant interval widths were compared. The WLS method is suggested for
   stochastic regressions of simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A key issue of the spectrum sensing functionality in Cognitive Radio
   (CR) networks is the ability of tuning the sensing time parameters,
   i.e., the sensing time and the transmission time, according to the
   Primary User (PU) network dynamics. In fact, these parameters influence
   both the spectrum sensing efficiency and the PU interference avoidance.
   This issue becomes even more challenging in presence of PU mobility. In
   this paper, an optimal spectrum sensing design for mobile PU scenarios
   is proposed with the aim to achieve the following important features: i)
   to determine the optimal mobility-aware transmission time, i. e., the
   transmission time value that jointly maximizes the spectrum sensing
   efficiency and satisfies the PU interference constraint; ii) to
   determine the optimal mobility-aware sensing time threshold, i. e., the
   maximum sensing time value assuring efficient spectrum sensing. First,
   closed-form expressions of both the optimal transmission time and the
   optimal sensing time threshold are analytically derived for a general PU
   mobility model. Then, the derived expressions are specialized for two
   widely adopted mobility models, i. e., the Random Walk mobility Model
   with reflection and the Random Way-Point mobility Model. Practical rules
   for the sensing parameter tuning are provided with reference to the
   considered mobility models. The analytical results are finally validated
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, compact models of spin-relaxation lengths (SRLs) in
   copper and aluminum interconnects by incorporating contributions to spin
   relaxation from phonon-induced and defect-induced scatterings are
   developed. The proposed models have been exhaustively calibrated with
   experimental data from mesoscopic lateral spin valves. The compact
   models are used to predict the SRL in ultrascaled copper and aluminum
   interconnects with cross-sectional dimensions of only few hundreds of
   nm(2). Even though the SRL in bulk copper can be as large as 400 nm, it
   is predicted that SRL can become sub-100 nm for a 7.5-nm-wide channel in
   the presence of nominal size effects. It is found that the SRL in
   aluminum is more than that in copper for the same size effects and
   interconnect cross-sectional dimensions. The degradation in SRL in
   aluminum with size effects is slower than that in copper. Using the
   compact models for SRL in conjunction with spin-diffusion theory, spin
   injection and transport efficiency (SITE) for metallic interconnects in
   a conventional spin-valve configuration is quantified in the presence of

Abstract = {{Measurements from central site (CS) monitors are often used as estimates
   of exposure in air pollution epidemiological studies. As these
   measurements are typically limited in their spatiotemporal resolution,
   true exposure variability within a population is often obscured, leading
   to potential measurement errors. To fully examine this limitation, we
   developed a set of alternative daily exposure metrics for each of the
   169 ZIP codes in the Atlanta, GA, metropolitan area, from 1999 to 2002,
   for PM2.5 and its components (elemental carbon (EC), SO4), O-3, carbon
   monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Metrics were applied in a
   study investigating the respiratory health effects of these pollutants.
   The metrics included: (i) CS measurements (one CS per pollutant); (ii)
   air quality model results for regional background pollution; (iii)
   local-scale AERMOD air quality model results; (iv) hybrid air quality
   model estimates (a combination of (ii) and (iii)); and (iv) population
   exposure model predictions (SHEDS and APEX). Differences in estimated
   spatial and temporal variability were compared by exposure metric and
   pollutant. Comparisons showed that: (i) both hybrid and exposure model
   estimates exhibited high spatial variability for traffic-related
   pollutants (CO, NOx, and EC), but little spatial variability among ZIP
   code centroids for regional pollutants (PM2.5, SO4, and O-3); (ii) for
   all pollutants except NOx, temporal variability was consistent across
   metrics; (iii) daily hybrid-to-exposure model correlations were strong
   (r>0.82) for all pollutants, suggesting that when temporal variability
   of pollutant concentrations is of main interest in an epidemiological
   application, the use of estimates from either model may yield similar
   results; (iv) exposure models incorporating infiltration parameters,
   time-location-activity budgets, and other exposure factors affect the
   magnitude and spatiotemporal distribution of exposure, especially for
   local pollutants. The results of this analysis can inform the
   development of more appropriate exposure metrics for future
   epidemiological studies of the short-term effects of particulate and
   gaseous ambient pollutant exposure in a community.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies frequently use central site concentrations as
   surrogates of exposure to air pollutants. Variability in air pollutant
   infiltration due to differential air exchange rates (AERs) is
   potentially a major factor affecting the relationship between central
   site concentrations and actual exposure, and may thus influence observed
   health risk estimates. In this analysis, we examined AER as an effect
   modifier of associations between several urban air pollutants and
   corresponding emergency department (ED) visits for asthma and wheeze
   during a 4-year study period (January 1999-December 2002) for a 186 ZIP
   code area in metro Atlanta. We found positive associations for the
   interaction between AER and pollution on asthma ED visits for both
   carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), indicating significant
   or near-significant effect modification by AER on the pollutant
   risk-ratio estimates. In contrast, the interaction term between
   particulate matter (PM)(2.5) and AER on asthma ED visits was negative
   and significant. However, alternative distributional tertile analyses
   showed PM2.5 and AER epidemiological model results to be similar to
   those found for NOx and CO (namely, increasing risk ratios (RRs) with
   increasing AERs when ambient PM2.5 concentrations were below the highest
   tertile of their distribution). Despite the fact that ozone (O-3) was a
   strong independent predictor of asthma ED visits in our main analysis,
   we found no O-3-AER effect modification. To our knowledge, our findings
   for CO, NOx, and PM2.5 are the first to provide an indication of
   short-term (i.e., daily) effect modification of multiple air
   pollution-related risk associations with daily changes in AER. Although
   limited to one outcome category in a single large urban locale, the
   findings suggest that the use of relatively simple and easy-to-derive
   AER surrogates may reflect intraurban differences in short-term
   exposures to pollutants of ambient origin.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this effort is to pursue artificial microscale surface
   roughness features in the form of dimples, on the walls of an air-cooled
   heat sink channel, as a passive option to energy-efficiently augment
   heat transfer in forced convection flows. High fidelity numerical
   simulations were employed for realizing an optimized dimple
   configuration and to comprehend the behavior of microsized dimples under
   high velocity (similar to 17m/s) transitional flow conditions. Fully
   developed flow simulations were performed, and design of experiments
   with response surface methodology was employed for the numerical
   optimization. The results showed similar to 30\% heat transfer
   improvement and similar to 15\% pressure drop increase in the fully
   developed region compared to a smooth-walled channel. Practicability of
   manufacturing 200 mu m deep dimples on a 600 mu m thin aluminum fin was
   demonstrated. Experiments were also carried out to assess the
   performance of the aforementioned optimized configuration in a custom
   built setup in the laboratory, which showed up to 10.5\% heat transfer
   improvement and similar to 12\% pressure drop increase over a
   corresponding smooth-walled channel. The above results indicate that the
   performance of dimples is allied with the flow development
   characteristics. In addition, experiments performed at Reynolds numbers
   other than one at which the dimples were optimized showed inferior
   performance showing that application-specific optimization of dimples is
   crucial. With further exploration of shape and design parameters,
   dimples might have the potential to improve thermal performance
   passively and form an attractive candidate to realize high-performance
   air-cooled heat sinks in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Most construction worker education and training environments apply
   traditional teaching methods to educate workers about hazards and
   productivity in the workplace. Many rely on using conventional
   teacher-student classroom settings, but there are few effective
   interactive methods applied which can objectively engage trainer and
   trainees and assess their performance during and after training
   sessions. Presented is a novel approach towards integrating real-time
   location tracking and three-dimensional immersive data visualization
   technologies in existing construction worker education and training
   environments. The scope is limited to steel-erection tasks performed by
   union ironworkers in an indoor training center. Results to analysis and
   visualization of the gathered data from training session are shown. The
   potential for assessing and improving the trainers' and apprentices'
   safety and productivity performance is explained. Since such
   technologies have hardly been used as part of existing construction
   education and training techniques, the opportunities including return on
   investment and user feedback were studied. The results show that unsafe
   practices in worker training environments can be detected and visualized
   and furthermore their training effectiveness can be indirectly measured.

Abstract = {{A robust physical design of 3-D IC requires investigation on
   through-silicon via (TSV). The large temperatures and stress gradients
   can severely affect TSV delay with large variation. The traditional
   physical model treats TSV as a resistor with linear electrical-thermal
   dependence, which ignores the fundamental device physics. In this paper,
   a physics-based electrical-thermal-mechanical delay model is developed
   for signal TSVs in 3-D IC. With consideration of liner material and also
   stress, a nonlinear model is established between electrical delay with
   temperature and stress. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed to
   relate the reduction of temperature and stress gradients with respect to
   dummy TSVs insertion. Taking the design of 3-D clock tree as a case
   study, we have formulated a nonlinear optimization problem for
   clock-skew reduction. By allocating dummy TSVs to reduce the temperature
   and stress gradients, the clock skew introduced by signal TSVs and
   drivers can be minimized. A number of 3-D clock-tree benchmarks are
   utilized in experiments. We have observed that with the use of dummy TSV
   insertion, clock skew can be reduced by 61.3\% on average when the
   accurate nonlinear electrical-thermal-mechanical delay model is applied.}},

Abstract = {{Computer hardware is moving from uniprocessor to multicore
   architectures. One problem arising in this evolution is that only
   parallel software can exploit the full performance potential of
   multicore architectures, and parallel software is far harder to write
   than conventional serial software. One important class of failures
   arising in parallel software is circular-wait deadlock in multithreaded
   programs. In our ongoing Gadara project, we use a special class of Petri
   nets, called Gadara nets, to systematically model multithreaded programs
   with lock allocation and release operations. In this paper, we propose
   an efficient optimal control synthesis methodology for ordinary Gadara
   nets that exploits the structural properties of Gadara nets via siphon
   analysis. Optimality in this context refers to the elimination of
   deadlocks in the program with minimally restrictive control logic. We
   formally establish a set of important properties of the proposed control
   synthesis methodology, and show that our algorithms never synthesize
   redundant control logic. We conduct experiments to evaluate the
   efficiency and scalability of the proposed methodology, and discuss the
   application of our results to real-world concurrent software.}},

Abstract = {{The digital world has given rise to massive quantities of data that
   include rich semantic and complex networks. A social graph, for example,
   containing hundreds of millions of actors and tens of billions of
   relationships is not uncommon. Analyzing these large data sets, even to
   answer simple analytic queries, often pushes the limits of algorithms
   and machine architectures. We present GraphCT, a scalable framework for
   graph analysis using parallel and multithreaded algorithms on shared
   memory platforms. Utilizing the unique characteristics of the Cray XMT,
   GraphCT enables fast network analysis at unprecedented scales on a
   variety of input data sets. On a synthetic power law graph with 2
   billion vertices and 17 billion edges, we can find the connected
   components in 2 minutes. We can estimate the betweenness centrality of a
   similar graph with 537 million vertices and over 8 billion edges in
   under 1 hour. GraphCT is built for portability and performance.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Udwadia-Kalaba approach for parallel manipulator dynamics
   analysis is presented. The approach segments a parallel manipulator
   system into several leg-subsystems and the platform subsystem, which are
   connected by kinematic constraints. The Udwadia-Kalaba equation is then
   used to calculate the constraint forces due to the constraints. Based on
   this, the equation of motion, which is an explicit (i.e., closed) form,
   can be formulated. The method allows a systematic procedure to generate
   the dynamic model for both direct dynamics and inverse dynamics without
   invoking additional variables (such as multipliers or quasi-variables),
   nor does it require projection. A classical parallel Stewart-Gough
   platform is chosen to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Pump controlled hydraulic actuators offer higher energy efficiency than
   valve controlled actuators. However, there exists mode switching in pump
   controlled systems and instability may arise when a single rod cylinder
   is implemented. This paper examines the problem of system stability in a
   pump controlled system with single rod cylinders. It is shown that the
   system dynamics have a stable tendency or an instable tendency
   corresponding to different cylinder movements. The paper shows system
   instability can be avoided by controlling fluid leakage, and two
   applicable methods are presented: physical leakage compensation and
   virtual leakage compensation, which can be applied depending on
   applications. Experiments and numerical simulations are presented.
   Results show that the proposed solutions can maintain circuit stability:
   physical leakage compensation can be a general approach while virtual
   leakage compensation offers higher energy efficiency and lower cost, but
   its applications are limited by some factors.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective Combined magnetic resonance/positron emission
   tomography (MR/PET) is a relatively new, hybrid imaging modality.
   MR-based attenuation correction often requires segmentation of the bone
   on MR images. In this study, we present an automatic segmentation method
   for the skull on MR images for attenuation correction in brain MR/PET
   applications.
   Materials and methods Our method transforms T1-weighted MR images to the
   Radon domain and then detects the features of the skull image. In the
   Radon domain we use a bilateral filter to construct a multiscale image
   series. For the repeated convolution we increase the spatial smoothing
   in each scale and make the width of the spatial and range Gaussian
   function doubled in each scale. Two filters with different kernels along
   the vertical direction are applied along the scales from the coarse to
   fine levels. The results from a coarse scale give a mask for the next
   fine scale and supervise the segmentation in the next fine scale. The
   use of the multiscale bilateral filtering schemeis to improve the
   robustness of the method for noise MR images. After combining the two
   filtered sinograms, the reciprocal binary sinogram of the skull is
   obtained for the reconstruction of the skull image.
   Results This method has been tested with brain phantom data, simulated
   brain data, and real MRI data. For real MRI data the Dice overlap ratios
   are 92.2\%1.9\% between our segmentation and manual segmentation.
   Conclusions The multiscale segmentation method is robust and accurate
   and can be used for MRI-based attenuation correction in combined MR/PET.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives With the objective of bringing clinical decision support
   systems to reality, this article reviews histopathological whole-slide
   imaging informatics methods, associated challenges, and future research
   opportunities.
   Target audience This review targets pathologists and informaticians who
   have a limited understanding of the key aspects of whole-slide image
   (WSI) analysis and/or a limited knowledge of state-of-the-art
   technologies and analysis methods.
   Scope First, we discuss the importance of imaging informatics in
   pathology and highlight the challenges posed by histopathological WSI.
   Next, we provide a thorough review of current methods for: quality
   control of histopathological images; feature extraction that captures
   image properties at the pixel, object, and semantic levels; predictive
   modeling that utilizes image features for diagnostic or prognostic
   applications; and data and information visualization that explores WSI
   for de novo discovery. In addition, we highlight future research
   directions and discuss the impact of large public repositories of
   histopathological data, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, on the field of
   pathology informatics. Following the review, we present a case study to
   illustrate a clinical decision support system that begins with quality
   control and ends with predictive modeling for several cancer endpoints.
   Currently, state-of-the-art software tools only provide limited image
   processing capabilities instead of complete data analysis for clinical
   decision-making. We aim to inspire researchers to conduct more research
   in pathology imaging informatics so that clinical decision support can
   become a reality.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on early age and
   long-term properties of cement-based materials is examined
   experimentally through isothermal calorimetry, chemical shrinkage,
   setting time, compressive strength and surface microhardness, where part
   of the cement is replaced with TiO2: Early age hydration is accelerated
   by TiO2 nanoparticles which also increase degrees of hydration of
   Portland cement, as evidenced by isothermal calorimetry and chemical
   shrinkage results. With increasing amounts of TiO2, setting time is
   reduced, despite decreasing cement content, due to TiO2 replacement,
   again showing accelerated hydration. Comparing TiO2-cement composites
   from two different TiO2 manufacturers, results suggest that size of
   nanoparticles and dispersability are critical in the rate of hydration,
   with smaller size agglomerates, but not necessarily smaller size
   particles, producing a greater effect. Compressive strength increases
   with higher TiO2 nanoparticle replacement at lower water-to-solids ratio
   (w/s = 0.40) and strength is not compromised by up to 10\% TiO2
   replacement at higher w/s 0.60. However, microhardness of the composite
   decreases with higher TiO2 amount. Broadly, these results indicate that
   mineral addition as cement replacement can be optimised in terms of
   dosage and dispersability to achieve lower cement fractions without
   compromising strength, but that the potential for reductions in hardness
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for estimating directional energy spectra of surface water waves
   from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data are presented in
   cases of (1) waves on arbitrary, horizontal mean flows and (2) waves on
   a two-layer, density stratified fluid with finite water depth. An
   existing perturbation expansion method is employed up to second order to
   compensate for the effect of arbitrary mean velocity profiles. Equations
   describing characteristics of random waves on a two-layer fluid are
   utilized to allow determination of directional surface and interfacial
   wave spectra. Wave-induced velocities based on model wave spectra were
   synthesized for simulating ADCP measurement schemes to verify the new
   method, and to investigate misestimation when the two-layer condition
   was neglected. Errors are typically smaller than other measurement
   uncertainties but depend greatly on the relationship among wave
   characteristics, interface depth, relative densities, and measurement
   locations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid lattice-Boltzmann numerical simulation method is undertaken to
   study the rheology of non-colloidal, rigid fibres in sheared, semidilute
   Newtonian suspension. The viscosity and the first normal stress
   difference are calculated with the combined use of numerical fibre
   orientation information and a corrected form of the slender body theory
   of Batchelor (J Fluid Mech Digit Arch 46(4):813-829, 1971). The
   corrections make the theory applicable in semidilute suspension flow
   (Shaqfeh and Fredrickson, Phys Fluids A: Fluid Dyn 2(1):7-24, 1990) with
   fibres of finite aspect ratio. The corrected theory within its
   framework, based on spacing among fibres in semidilute suspension, only
   considers hydrodynamic interactions among fibres and inferences that the
   effect of actual fibre-fibre mechanical contacts on rheological
   properties of such suspension systems remains inconsequential. To
   investigate this issue, the rheological properties of semidilute
   suspension were calculated directly from the numerical simulation. This
   approach accounted for both hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions
   among fibres. This direct measurement proved that the mechanical
   interactions increase both the relative shear viscosity and the first
   normal stress difference in the semidilute suspension to values which
   are larger than permissible within the framework of Batchelor's theory.}},

Abstract = {{Successful tissue-engineering strategies for cartilage repair must
   maximize the efficacy of chondrocytes within their limited life span. To
   that end, the combination of exogenous growth factors with mechanical
   stimuli holds promise for development of clinically relevant cartilage
   tissue substitutes. The current study aimed to determine whether
   incorporation of transient exposure to growth factors into a
   hydrodynamic bioreactor system can improve the functional maturation of
   tissue-engineered cartilage. Chondrocyte-seeded polyglycolic acid
   scaffolds were cultivated within a wavy-walled bioreactor that imparts
   fluid flow-induced shear stress for 4 weeks. Constructs were nourished
   with 100ng/mL insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or 10ng/mL
   transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) either for the first 15 days of the
   culture (transient) or throughout the entire cultivation (continuous).
   Transiently treated constructs were found to exhibit better functional
   properties than continuously nourished constructs. The limited
   development of engineered tissues continuously stimulated by IGF-1 or
   TGF-1 was related to massive growth factor leftovers in the environments
   that downregulated the expression of the associated receptors. Treatment
   with TGF-1 eliminated the formation of a fibrous capsule at the
   construct periphery possibly through suppression of Smad3
   phosphorylation, yielding constructs with greater homogeneity.
   Furthermore, TGF-1 reversely regulated Smad2 and Smad3 pathways in
   articular chondrocytes under hydrodynamic stimuli partially via Smad7.
   Collectively, transient exposure to growth factors is likely to maintain
   chondrocyte homeostasis, and thus promotes their anabolic activities
   under hydrodynamic stimuli. The present work suggests that robust
   hydrodynamically engineered neocartilage with a reduced fibrotic
   response and enhanced tissue homogeneity can be achieved through
   optimization of growth factor supplementation protocols and potentially
   through manipulation of intracellular signals such as Smad.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic induction systems have proven to be very effective in
   detecting subsurface metallic and magnetic objects. Such systems often
   employ separate transmit and receive coils, and thus it is desirable for
   the transmit and receive coils in these systems to have minimal mutual
   coupling. It is also desirable for the product of the fields generated
   by the transmit and receive coils to be as large as possible to maximize
   the detection depth. We demonstrate that a pair of spiral coils can be
   optimized to achieve these desired properties. A mathematical
   representation is chosen for the coils, which allows the coil pair to be
   optimized using an iterative convex method, which, due to its convexity,
   is very fast. We then present results showing a pair of nonuniformly
   wound spiral coils created with this optimization.}},

Abstract = {{T cells are key players of the mammalian adaptive immune system. They
   experience different mechanical microenvironments during their life
   cycle, from the thymus, secondary lymph organs, and peripheral tissues
   that are free of externally applied force, but display variable
   substrate rigidities to the blood and lymphatic circulation systems,
   where complicated hydrodynamic forces are present. Regardless of whether
   T cells are subject to external forces or generate their own internal
   forces, they respond and adapt to different biomechanical cues to
   modulate their adhesion, migration, trafficking, and triggering of
   immune functions through mechanical regulation of various molecules that
   bear force. These include adhesive receptors, immunoreceptors, motor
   proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and their associated molecules. Here,
   we discuss the forces acting on various surface and cytoplasmic proteins
   of a T cell in different mechanical milieus. We review existing data on
   how force regulates protein conformational changes and interactions with
   counter molecules, including integrins, actin, and the T-cell receptor,
   and how each relates to T-cell functions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a hybrid method for rapidly measuring thermal data
   and three-dimensional (3D) geometries of buildings, allowing virtual
   representations of the energy and environmental performance of existing
   buildings. The 3D thermal models can be further used for many
   applications by building occupants, owners, and outside consultants to
   make retrofit decisions. Existing buildings represent the greatest
   opportunity to improve building energy efficiency and reduce
   environmental impacts. This research aims to help decision makers
   improve their buildings by providing reliable, visual information about
   their buildings' energy performance using the developed hybrid light
   detection and ranging (LIDAR) system. The 3D thermal model described
   consists of point clouds of building geometry with thermal data on each
   point, including temperature values (degrees C) and thermal color
   generated on the basis of the temperature value. Window detection
   algorithms were developed in this study to create virtual thermal points
   on window glasses because a LIDAR system is unable to collect geometric
   data from transparent objects. The system's technical feasibility has
   been successfully demonstrated through intensive lab and field
   experiments on residential and small commercial buildings. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Low-operating voltage, high mobility, and stable organic field-effect
   transistors (OFETs) using polymeric dielectrics such as pristine
   poly(4-vinyl phenol) (PVP) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
   dissolved in solvents of high dipole moment, have been achieved. High
   dipole moment solvents such as propylene carbonate and dimethyl
   sulfoxide used for dissolving the polymer dielectric enhance the charge
   carrier mobilities by three orders of magnitude in pentacene OFETs
   compared with low dipole moment solvents. Fast switching circuits with
   patterned gate PVP-based pentacene OFETs demonstrated a switching
   frequency of 75 kHz at input voltages of |5 V|. The frequency response
   of the OFETs is attributed to a high degree of dipolar-order in
   dielectric films obtained from high-polarity solvents and the resulting
   energetically ordered landscape for transport. Remarkably, these
   pentacene-based OFETs exhibited high stability under bias stress and in
   air with negligible shifts in the threshold voltage. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{We report on the photovoltaic properties of polymer solar cells that use
   NiO-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) as the hole-collecting electrode. The
   NiO films were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on top of ITO
   with thicknesses varying from 6 to 25 nm. The NiO films increase the
   work function (WF) of the ITO, allowing NiO-coated ITO to act as an
   efficient hole-collecting electrode. Devices made with pristine NiO
   showed poor current-voltage characteristics. However, subsequent
   O-2-plasma treatment further increased the WF of NiO, tuning NiO-coated
   ITO into an efficient hole-collecting electrode for polymer solar cells
   based on the donor poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT). The polymer
   solar cells with the O-2-plasma treated NiO-coated ITO hole-collecting
   electrodes yield a power conversion efficiency of 4.1 +/- 0.2\% under
   simulated air mass 1.5 G 100 mW/cm(2) illumination, which is comparable
   to reference devices with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):

Abstract = {{A micromechanically based formulation of the cooperative model is
   incorporated into the viscoplasticity theory based on overstress (VBO)
   model. The plastic shear strain rate given by the cooperative model is
   used as a flow function which is responsible for rate and temperature
   dependence in the VBO model. In this way, thermomechanical analysis can
   be performed under different loading rates and temperatures of amorphous
   polymers. Introducing strain softening, the temperature- and
   strain-rate-dependent elasticity moduli are two other modifications of
   the VBO formulation. The validity of the newly proposed cooperative VBO
   model is demonstrated by modeling the uniaxial compression behavior of
   poly(methyl methacrylate) under different temperatures and strain rates.

Pages = {{460-470}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study, effects of point vacancy, Stone-Wales and bivacancy
   defects on thermal conductivity and tensile response of single-layer
   graphene sheets are studied using classical molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) method, we
   found that thermal conductivity of graphene is considerably sensitive to
   existence of defects. It was observed that only 0.25\% concentration of
   defects in graphene lead to significant reduction of graphene thermal
   conductivity by around 50\%. By applying uniaxial tensile loading, we
   studied the deformation process of graphene. We found that elastic
   modulus, tensile strength and strain at failure of graphene decrease by
   increase of defects concentrations. Obtained results suggest that
   thermal conduction in graphene is much more vulnerable to defects in
   comparison with mechanical properties. Reported results by this work
   provide an overall viewpoint concerning the intensity of defects'
   effects on the graphene thermal and mechanical response. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We developed a facile method to transfer vertically aligned carbon
   nanotubes (VACNT) onto a carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate using

   this work that the VACNT-CFP can be used as a supercapacitor electrode
   with excellent rate performance and cycling stability, which could be
   attributed to the vertically alignment and chemical stability of CNTs in
   the hybrid structure. Further, we found that VACNT-CFP showed good
   resistance to the impact of flowing water when tested as a capacitive
   deionizer electrode, owing to superior mechanical robustness of the

   corrosion rates of UNS44660 were much lower than the other grades of
   stainless steel in the presence of the sodium sulfide. Potentiodynamic
   polarization and linear polarization resistance measurements showed that
   the electrochemical behavior was altered by the adhesion of sulfur
   species, which reduced the polarization resistances and increased the
   anodic current densities. SEM and XPS results imply that the surface
   films that formed in caustic solution containing sodium sulfide were

Abstract = {{Intracortical electrodes record neural signals directly from local
   populations of neurons in the brain, and conduct them to external
   electronics that control prosthetics. However, the relationship between
   electrode design, defined by shape, size and tethering; and long-term
   (chronic) stability of the neuron-electrode interface is poorly
   understood. Here, we studied the effects of various commercially
   available intracortical electrode designs that vary in shape
   (cylindrical, planar), size (15 mu m, 50 mu m and 75 mu m), and
   tethering {[}electrode connections to connector with (tethered) and
   without tethering cable (untethered)] using histological,
   transcriptomic, and electrophysiological analyses over acute (3 day) and
   chronic (12 week) timepoints. Quantitative analysis of histological
   sections indicated that Michigan 50 mu m (M50) and Michigan tethered
   (MT) electrodes induced significantly (p < 0.01) higher glial scarring,
   and lesser survival of neurons in regions of blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   breach when compared to microwire (MW) and Michigan 15 mu m (M15)
   electrodes acutely and chronically. Gene expression analysis of the
   neurotoxic cytokines interleukin (Il)1 (Il1 alpha, Il1 beta), Il6, Il17
   (Il17a, Il17b, Il17f), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf) indicated
   that MW electrodes induced significantly (p < 0.05) reduced expression
   of these transcripts when compared to M15, M50 and FMAA electrodes
   chronically. Finally, electrophysiological assessment of electrode
   function indicated that MW electrodes performed significantly (p < 0.05)
   better than all other electrodes over a period of 12 weeks. These
   studies reveal that intracortical electrodes with smaller size,
   cylindrical shape, and without tethering cables produce significantly
   diminished inflammatory responses when compared to large, planar and
   tethered electrodes. These studies provide a platform for the rational
   design and assessment of chronically functional intracortical electrode
   implants in the future. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-based therapies have potential for tissue regeneration but poor
   delivery methods lead to low viability or dispersal of cells from target
   sites, limiting clinical utility. Here, we developed a degradable and
   injectable hydrogel to deliver stem cells for bone regeneration.
   Alginate microbeads <200 mu m are injectable, persist at implantation
   sites and contain viable cells, but do not readily degrade in-vivo. We
   hypothesized that controlled release of rat adipose-derived stem cells
   (ASCs) from alginate microbeads can be achieved by incorporating
   alginate-lyase in the hydrogel. Microbeads were formed using high
   electrostatic potential. Controlled degradation was achieved through
   direct combination of alginate-lyase and alginate at 4 degrees C.
   Results showed that microbead degradation and cell release depended on
   the alginate-lyase to alginate ratio. Viability of released cells ranged
   from 87\% on day 2 to 71\% on day 12. Monolayer cultures of released
   ASCs grown in osteogenic medium produced higher levels of osteocalcin
   and similar levels of other soluble factors as ASCs that were neither
   previously encapsulated nor exposed to alginate-lyase. Bmp2, Fgf2, and
   Vegfa mRNA in released cells were also increased. Thus, this delivery
   system allows for controlled release of viable cells and can modulate
   their downstream osteogenic factor production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to determine the effect of the processing
   method on the mechanical, thermo-mechanical and electrical properties of
   graphite rianoplatelets (GNP) reinforced polyamide 12 (PA12) composites.
   The two processing methods studied are injection molding (IM) and
   selective laser sintering (SLS). The composites made by SLS exhibited
   higher, tensile modulus, comparable or better flexural properties and
   lower impact strength than those made by IM. This enhancement is
   supported by the higher degree of crystallinity and more effective
   interfacial interactions observed in the SLS composites compared to
   those made by IM. At higher GNP content the property enhancement is
   compromised due to the presence of GNP agglomerates. Furthermore, it was
   found that the SLS composites filled with 5 wt\% of GNP exhibited four
   orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity compared to their
   counterpart made by IM which exhibited electrical properties similar to
   the neat PA12. The understanding of the processing-structure-property
   relationship investigated here can lead to composites engineered for
   targeted applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is to understand the reinforcing efficiency of
   carbon nanotubes (CNT) in polymers through finite element modeling. The
   novelty of our work is that the probability distribution functions of
   CNT diameter, orientation, dispersion and waviness, determined through
   image analysis, are incorporated in the finite element model allowing
   thus for fundamental understanding of how the CNT characteristics affect
   the tensile modulus of CNT reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. The
   presence of interphase, confirmed by atomic force microscopy, is also
   accounted for in our model. The image analysis approach utilizes
   scanning electron microscopy images of the CNT/PP composites made by
   melt mixing and injection molding. Model predictions are compared with
   the data obtained experimentally according to ASTM D638. A good
   agreement between the model predictions and experimental data is

Abstract = {{An image processing observational technique for the stereoscopic

   technique incorporates the enforcement of any given statistical wave law
   modeling the quasi-Gaussianity of oceanic waves observed in nature. The
   problem is posed in a variational optimization framework, where the
   desired waveform is obtained as the minimizer of a cost functional that
   combines image observations, smoothness priors and a weak statistical
   constraint. The minimizer is obtained by combining gradient descent and
   multigrid methods on the necessary optimality equations of the cost
   functional. Robust photometric error criteria and a spatial intensity
   compensation model are also developed to improve the performance of the
   presented image matching strategy. The weak statistical constraint is
   thoroughly evaluated in combination with other elements presented to
   reconstruct and enforce constraints on experimental stereo data,
   demonstrating the improvement in the estimation of the observed ocean
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a robust regression method called regression with outlier
   shrinkage (ROS) for the traditional n > p cases. It improves over the
   other robust regression methods such as least trimmed squares (LTS) in
   the sense that it can achieve maximum breakdown value and full
   asymptotic efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, its computational
   complexity is no more than that of LTS. We also propose a sparse
   estimator, called sparse regression with outlier shrinkage (SROS), for
   robust variable selection and estimation. It is proven that SROS can not
   only give consistent selection but also estimate the nonzero
   coefficients with full asymptotic efficiency under the normal model. In
   addition, we introduce a concept of nearly regression equivariant
   estimator for understanding the breakdown properties of sparse
   estimators, and prove that SROS achieves the maximum breakdown value of
   nearly regression equivariant estimators. Numerical examples are
   presented to illustrate our methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Matrimid (R) hollow fiber membranes with silicone rubber (PDMS) calked
   fused nodular selective layers display much higher CO2/N-2 selectivity
   as well as higher CO2 permeance than those with isotropic dense
   selective layers at 253.15 K. Two kinds of asymmetric hollow fiber
   membranes were successfully spun: fibers with fused nodular skins and
   fibers with truly dense skins. The skin morphologies were confirmed with
   SEM images. CO2/N-2 mixed gas permeation characterization was carried
   out within the temperature range of 253.15 K to 308.15 K. Permeation
   results showed that, at 253.15 K, the nodular skinned fibers displayed
   CO2/N-2 selectivity of 90.5, and CO2 permeance of 63.3 GPU after
   standard PDMS calking; while the dense skinned fibers displayed CO2/N-2
   selectivity of 52.5, and CO2 permeance of 16.6 GPU. The PDMS calking had
   negligible effect on the dense skinned fibers, but it was necessary for
   the fused nodular skinned fibers. A hypothesis regarding the
   introduction of Langmuir sorption sites and a local orientation of
   polymer chain segments is proposed to explain the better performance of
   the calked nodular skinned fibers. This work provides a promising method
   for improved hollow fiber membranes for the removal of CO2 from flue

Abstract = {{Thermal rectification has recently attracted great attention because it
   could allow heat to flow in a preferred direction and may have promising
   applications in thermal management and energy systems. In addition to
   phonon engineering, photon transport at the near-field regime has been
   recently proposed to realize thermal rectification between planar
   structures. In the present study, the thermal rectification effect
   enabled by near-field thermal radiation between intrinsic silicon and
   other materials was investigated at various temperatures and vacuum gap
   distances. Strong thermal rectification between intrinsic Si and doped
   Si (rectification R=2.7) and between intrinsic Si and SiO2 (R=9.9) can
   be achieved with a 5 nm vacuum gap at temperatures of 1000 and 300 K.
   Rectification larger than one can be obtained in sub-10 nm vacuum gaps
   for the former configuration and sub-20 nm gaps for the latter
   configuration. A thermal rectifier made of gold and intrinsic Si is
   shown to have a rectification factor around 0.85 with temperatures of
   600 and 300 K at a wide range of vacuum gaps from 100 to 500 nm. The
   physical mechanisms of the rectification effect in the three
   configurations are elucidated, and each of the proposed thermal
   rectifiers may have its own advantage for applications dealing with
   different temperatures and vacuum distances.}},

Title = {{Universal failure model for multi-unit systems with shared functionality}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{141-149}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A Universal Failure Model (UFM) is proposed for complex systems that
   rely on a large number of entities for performing a common function.
   Economy of scale or other considerations may dictate the need to pool
   resources for common purpose, but the resulting strong coupling
   precludes the grouping of those components into modules. Existing
   system-level failure models rely on modularity for reducing modeling
   complexity, so the UFM will fill an important gap in constructing
   efficient system-level models. Conceptually, the UFM resembles cellular
   automata (CA) infused with realistic failure mechanisms. Components'
   behavior is determined based on the balance between their strength
   (capacity) and their load (demand) share. If the load exceeds the
   components' capacity, the component fails and its load share is
   distributed among its neighbors (possibly with a time delay and load
   losses). The strength of components can degrade with time if the load
   exceeds an elastic threshold. The global load (demand) carried by the
   system can vary over time, with the peak values providing shocks to the
   system (e.g., wind loads in civil structures, electricity demand,
   stressful activities to human bodies, or drought in an ecosystem).
   Unlike the models traditionally studied by CA, the focus of the
   presented model is on the system reliability, and specifically on the
   study of time-to-failure distributions, rather than steady-state
   patterns and average time-to-failure characteristics. In this context,
   the relationships between the types of failure distributions and the
   parameters of the failure model are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The development of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells that

   report a novel PEM based on 1H-1,2,4-triazole grafted polysiloxane doped
   with phosphoric acid and reinforced with porous
   expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) film. Both bulk resistances and
   interfacial polarization resistances of the fuel cells based on this
   membrane were determined using impedance spectroscopy. Results indicate
   that the proton conductivities of the PEM have little dependence on
   operation temperature while the PEM fuel cells demonstrated good
   performance under very low humidity in a wide temperature range (from
   room temperature to more than 100 degrees C). The triazole-based new PEM
   may dramatically simplify the fuel-cell systems, offering great
   potential for mobile applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In modern manufacturing systems, online sensing is being increasingly
   used for process monitoring and fault diagnosis. In many practical
   situations, the output of the sensing system is represented by
   time-ordered data known as profiles or waveform signals. Most of the
   work reported in the literature has dealt with cases in which the
   production process is characterized by single profiles. In some
   industrial practices, however, the online sensing system is designed so
   that it records more than one profile at each operation cycle. For
   example, in multi-operation forging processes with transfer or
   progressive dies, four sensors are used to measure the tonnage force
   exerted on dies. To effectively analyze multichannel profiles, it is
   crucial to develop a method that considers the interrelationships
   between different profile channels. A method for analyzing multichannel
   profiles based on uncorrelated multilinear principal component analysis
   is proposed in this article for the purpose of characterizing process
   variations, fault detection, and fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of
   the proposed method is demonstrated by using simulations and a case
   study on a multi-operation forging process.}},

Abstract = {{Power transfer efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to the load (PDL)
   are two key inductive link design parameters that relate to the power
   source and driver specs, power loss, transmission range, robustness
   against misalignment, variations in loading, and interference with other
   devices. Designers need to strike a delicate balance between these two
   because designing the link to achieve high PTE will degrade the PDL and
   vice versa. We are proposing a new figure-of-merit (FoM), which can help
   designers to find out whether a two-, three-, or four-coil link is
   appropriate for their particular application and guide them through an
   iterative design procedure to reach optimal coil geometries based on how
   they weigh the PTE versus PDL for that application. Three design
   examples at three different power levels have been presented based on
   the proposed FoM for implantable microelectronic devices, handheld
   mobile devices, and electric vehicles. The new FoM suggests that the
   two-coil links are suitable when the coils are strongly coupled, and a
   large PDL is needed. Three-coil links are the best when the coils are
   loosely coupled, the coupling distance varies considerably, and large
   PDL is necessary. Finally, four-coil links are optimal when the PTE is
   paramount, the coils are loosely coupled, and their relative distance
   and alignment are stable. Measurement results support the accuracy of
   the theoretical design procedure and conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes supercapacitor energy loss and investigates its
   impact on power management in environmentally powered wireless sensor
   nodes that use supercapacitor-based energy storage systems. While
   supercapacitor self-discharge is usually taken into account for system
   design and power management in wireless sensor nodes, supercapacitor
   charge redistribution and the associated energy loss have not been
   considered. In an environmentally powered wireless sensor node,
   supercapacitor charge redistribution may have more significant impact on
   power management than self-discharge. This paper analyzes supercapacitor
   energy loss during charge redistribution based on the variable leakage
   resistance (VLR) model. It is concluded that supercapacitor energy loss
   is dependent on charge redistribution time and supercapacitor initial
   state, which is defined as the initial voltages across the capacitors in
   the VLR model. The impact of supercapacitor energy loss on power
   management is studied by considering the task scheduling problem. A set
   of simulation cases that covers various supercapacitor initial state and
   energy harvesting capability is designed to investigate the impact of
   supercapacitor energy loss on task scheduling policy. It is demonstrated
   that greedy or lazy scheduling policy is preferred depending on
   supercapacitor initial state and energy harvesting capability in terms
   of two performance evaluation metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Restructuring of metals by chiral molecules represents an important
   route to inducing and controlling enantioselective surface chemistry.
   Tartaric acid adsorption on Cu(110) has served as a useful system for
   understanding many aspects of chiral molecule adsorption and ordering on
   a metal surface, and a number of chiral and achiral unit cells have been
   reported. Herein, we show that given the appropriate annealing
   treatment, singly deprotonated tartaric acid monolayers can restructure
   the Cu metal itself, and that the resulting structure is both highly
   ordered and chiral. Molecular resolution scanning tunneling microscopy
   reveals that singly deprotonated tartaric acid extracts Cu atoms from
   the Cu(110) surface layer and incorporates them into highly ordered,
   chiral adatom arrays capped by a continuous molecular layer. Further
   evidence for surface restructuring comes from images of atom-deep
   trenches formed in the Cu(110) surface during the process. These
   trenches also run in low symmetry directions and are themselves chiral.
   Simulated scanning tunneling microscopy images are consistent with the
   appearance of the added atom rows and etched trenches. The chiral
   imprinting results in a long-range, highly ordered ((2)(6) (-1)(7)) unit
   cell covering the whole surface as confirmed by low energy electron
   diffraction. Details of the restructuring mechanism were further
   investigated via time-lapse imaging at elevated temperature. This work
   reveals the stages of nanoscale surface restructuring and offers an
   interesting method for chiral modification of an achiral metal surface.}},

Abstract = {{The photodesorption of water molecules from amorphous solid water (ASW)
   by 157-nm irradiation has been examined using resonance-enhanced
   multiphoton ionization. The rotational temperature has been determined,
   by comparison with simulations, to be 425 +/- 75 K. The time-of-flight
   spectrum of H2O (v = 0) has been fit with a Maxwell-Boltzmann
   distribution with a translational temperature of 700 +/- 200 K (0.12 +/-
   0.03 eV). H+ and OH+ fragment ions have been detected with non-resonant
   multiphoton ionization, indicating vibrationally excited parent water
   molecules with translational energies of 0.24 +/- 0.08 eV. The cross
   section for water removal from ASW by 7.9-eV photons near 100 K is (6.9
   +/- 1.8) x 10(-20) cm(2) for > 10 L H2O exposure. Electronic structure
   computations have also probed the excited states of water and the
   mechanisms of desorption. Calculated electron attachment and detachment
   densities show that exciton delocalization leads to a dipole reversal
   state in the first singlet excited state of a model system of hexagonal
   water ice. Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations show possible
   desorption of a photo-excited water molecule from this cluster, though
   the non-hydrogen bonded OH bond is stretched significantly before
   desorption. Potential energy curves of this OH stretch in the electronic
   excited state show a barrier to dissociation, lending credence to the
   dipole reversal mechanism. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Large classes of stochastic systems of interest to acoustics and
   vibrations have time delays. The presence of these time delays hinders
   efforts to provide physical insight into the system behavior, because of
   the difficulty of finding exact solutions. This paper addresses this
   issue by presenting exact steady-state solutions for the probability
   density functions (pdf's) for linear time delayed oscillators subjected
   to Gaussian excitation of arbitrary correlation. A key parameter
   influencing these pdf's is shown to be the ratio of mean generalized
   kinetic energy to the mean generalized potential energy. In a single
   damped harmonic oscillator this ratio is unity which implies art
   equi-partition of generalized energy. Time delays cause deviations in
   the equi-partition of generalized energy which creates regions of
   preferential total phase and causes the amplitude pdf to shift from a
   Rayleigh distribution to a Hoyt distribution. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{{[}1] The impact of future land use and land cover changes (LULCC) on
   regional and global climate is one of the most challenging aspects of
   understanding anthropogenic climate change. We study the impacts of
   LULCC on regional climate in the southeastern U.S. by downscaling the
   NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model E to the
   regional scale using a spectral nudging technique with the Weather
   Research and Forecasting Model. Climate-relevant meteorological fields
   are compared for two southeastern U.S. LULCC scenarios to the current
   land use/cover for four seasons of the year 2050. In this work it is
   shown that reforestation of cropland in the southeastern U.S. tends to
   warm surface air by up to 0.5 K, while replacing forested land with
   cropland tends to cool the surface air by 0.5 K. Processes leading to
   this response are investigated and sensitivity analyses conducted. The
   sensitivity analysis shows that results are most sensitive to changes in
   albedo and the stomatal resistance. Evaporative cooling of croplands
   also plays an important role in regional climate. Implications of LULCC
   on air quality are discussed. Summertime warming associated with
   reforestation of croplands could increase the production of some
   secondary pollutants, while a higher boundary layer will decrease
   pollutant concentrations; wintertime warming may decrease emissions from
   biomass burning from wood stoves.}},

Abstract = {{Droplet-based microreactors are used for the continuous production of Pd
   nanocrystals. Specifically, commercially available
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube and silica capillaries are utilized
   to fabricate a fluidic device capable of generating water-in-oil
   droplets. In addition to the feasibility of using such droplets as
   microreactors for conducting a synthesis, the ability to control the
   composition and concentration of reagents by adjusting the flow rates is
   demonstrated; reagents are mixed by periodically pinching the PTFE tube,
   and nanocrystals are produced with uniform size distribution in a
   continuous fashion. The capability to tailor the size and shape of the
   resultant nanocrystals is further demonstrated by introducing the
   reducing agent and capping agent at different flow rates to control the
   nucleation and growth processes. The ability to transform a bulk
   synthesis into a droplet-based system holds great potential for the
   development of a new route to the high-volume production of
   nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the shape and thus facets of metal nanocrystals is an
   effective way to enhance their performance in catalytic reactions. While
   Pd nanocrystals with a myriad of shapes have been successfully prepared
   with good uniformity and in high yield, Pd right bipyramids (RBPs) that
   have a singly twinned structure have been elusive. We report a facile
   route based on polyol reduction for the synthesis of Pd RBPs with purity
   >90\% and sizes controlled in the range 5-15 nm. The success of our
   synthesis relies on the use of iodide ions to manipulate the strength of
   an oxidative etchant and selectively cap the Pd\{100\} facets. The
   as-prepared RBPs could serve as seeds to generate a set of Pd
   nanocrystals with novel shapes and structures. The RBPs also exhibited
   enhanced catalytic activity toward formic acid oxidation, with a current
   density 2.5 and 7.1 times higher than those of the single-crystal Pd
   nanocubes (which were also mainly covered by \{100\} facets) and
   commercial Pd black, respectively.}},

   correlate}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Neuromodulators alter network output and have the potential to
   destabilize a circuit. The mechanisms maintaining stability in the face
   of neuromodulation are not well described. Using the pyloric network in
   the crustaceans tomato gastric nervous system, we show that dopamine
   (DA) does not simply alter circuit output, but activates a closed loop
   in which DA induced alterations in circuit output consequently drive a
   change in anionic conductance to preserve a conductance ratio and its
   activity correlate. DA acted at low affinity type 1 receptors (D1Rs) to
   induce an immediate modulatory decrease in the transient potassium
   current (I-A) of a pyloric neuron. This, in turn, advanced the activity
   phase of that component neuron, which disrupted its network function and
   thereby destabilized the circuit. DA simultaneously acted at high
   affinity D1Rs on the same neuron to confer activity dependence upon the
   hyperpolarization activated current (I-h) such that the DA-induced
   changes in activity subsequently reduced I-h. This DA-enabled,
   activity-dependent, intrinsic plasticity exactly compensated for the
   modulatory decrease in I-A to restore the I-A: I-h ratio and neuronal
   activity phase, thereby closing an open loop created by the modulator.
   Activation of closed loop stop reserve conductance ratios may represent
   a fundamental operating principle neuromodulatory systems use to ensure
   stability in their target networks.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although methods for generating cardiomyocytes from
   pluripotent stem cells have been reported, current methods produce
   heterogeneous mixtures of cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocyte cells.
   Here, we report an entirely novel system in which pluripotent stem
   cell-derived cardiomyocytes are purified by cardiomyocyte-specific
   molecular beacons (MBs). MBs are nanoscale probes that emit a
   fluorescence signal when hybridized to target mRNAs.
   Method and Results Five MBs targeting mRNAs of either cardiac troponin T
   or myosin heavy chain 6/7 were generated. Among 5 MBs, an MB that
   targeted myosin heavy chain 6/7 mRNA (MHC1-MB) identified up to 99\% of
   HL-1 cardiomyocytes, a mouse cardiomyocyte cell line, but <3\% of 4
   noncardiomyocyte cell types in flow cytometry analysis, which indicates
   that MHC1-MB is specific for identifying cardiomyocytes. We delivered
   MHC1-MB into cardiomyogenically differentiated pluripotent stem cells
   through nucleofection. The detection rate of cardiomyocytes was similar
   to the percentages of cardiac troponin T- or cardiac troponin I-positive
   cardiomyocytes, which supports the specificity of MBs. Finally,
   MHC1-MB-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter
   from mouse and human pluripotent stem cell differentiating cultures, and
   approximate to 97\% cells expressed cardiac troponin T or cardiac
   troponin I as determined by flow cytometry. These MB-based sorted cells
   maintained their cardiomyocyte characteristics, which was verified by
   spontaneous beating, electrophysiological studies, and expression of
   cardiac proteins. When transplanted in a myocardial infarction model,
   MB-based purified cardiomyocytes improved cardiac function and
   demonstrated significant engraftment for 4 weeks without forming tumors.
   Conclusions We developed a novel cardiomyocyte selection system that
   allows production of highly purified cardiomyocytes. These purified
   cardiomyocytes and this system can be valuable for cell therapy and drug
   discovery.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly variable, indicating
   that differences between slow and rapid progression forms could provide
   valuable information for improved early detection and management.
   Unfortunately, this represents a complex problem due to the
   heterogeneous nature of humans in regards to demographic
   characteristics, genetics, diet, environmental exposures and health
   behaviors. In this pilot study, we employed high resolution mass
   spectrometry-based metabolic profiling to investigate the metabolic
   signatures of slow versus rapidly progressing PD present in human serum.
   Archival serum samples from PD patients obtained within 3 years of
   disease onset were analyzed via dual chromatography-high resolution mass
   spectrometry, with data extraction by xMSanalyzer and used to predict
   rapid or slow motor progression of these patients during follow-up.
   Statistical analyses, such as false discovery rate analysis and partial
   least squares discriminant analysis, yielded a list of statistically
   significant metabolic features and further investigation revealed
   potential biomarkers. In particular, N8-acetyl spermidine was found to
   be significantly elevated in the rapid progressors compared to both
   control subjects and slow progressors. Our exploratory data indicate
   that a fast motor progression disease phenotype can be distinguished
   early in disease using high resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolic
   profiling and that altered polyamine metabolism may be a predictive
   marker of rapidly progressing PD.}},

   reactive compounds are needed to lower the cost of materials in a manner
   that is fundamentally more eco-friendly. Additionally, synthetic
   approaches for pi-conjugated materials with more functional group
   tolerance are desirable to expand the range of properties that can be
   realized in such materials. Developing new synthetic routes to materials
   can both broaden the scope of science that can be explored and increase
   the probability that interesting materials can be developed in an
   economically viable manner for inclusion in consumer products. One such
   synthetic strategy that can impact all of these issues is
   carbon-hydrogen bond activation and subsequent carbon-carbon bond
   formation (C-H functionalization). While the C-H functionalizations
   represented by direct arylation-based methods are not as developed as
   the widely used Stille and Suzuki methods at this stage, they allow for
   the use of readily accessible halogenated aromatic substances and can
   negate the need for toxic organotin reagents. They also hold promise of
   allowing for the synthesis of previously inaccessible materials. In this
   Perspective, our goal is to provide an overview of the current status in
   this challenging field by highlighting (1) the history of preparing
   pi-conjugated small molecules and macromolecules via cross-coupling
   reactions, (2) advances in preparation of versatile pi-conjugated small
   molecules and macromolecules via transition-metal-catalyzed direct
   arylation, and (3) the scope, limitations, and challenges for materials
   science.}},

Abstract = {{Size, surface charge, and material compositions are known to influence
   cell uptake of nanoparticles. However, the effect of particle geometry,
   i.e., the interplay between nanoscale shape and size, is less
   understood. Here we show that when shape is decoupled from volume,
   charge, and material composition, under typical in vitro conditions,
   mammalian epithelial and immune cells preferentially internalize
   disc-shaped, negatively charged hydrophilic nanoparticles of high aspect
   ratios compared with nanorods and lower aspect-ratio nanodiscs.
   Endothelial cells also prefer nanodiscs, however those of intermediate
   aspect ratio. Interestingly, unlike nanospheres, larger-sized hydrogel
   nanodiscs and nanorods are internalized more efficiently than their
   smallest counterparts. Kinetics, efficiency, and mechanisms of uptake
   are all shape-dependent and cell type-specific. Although
   macropinocytosis is used by both epithelial and endothelial cells,
   epithelial cells uniquely internalize these nanoparticles using the
   caveolae-mediated pathway. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, on
   the other hand, use clathrin-mediated uptake for all shapes and show
   significantly higher uptake efficiency compared with epithelial cells.
   Using results from both upright and inverted cultures, we propose that
   nanoparticle internalization is a complex manifestation of three
   shape-and size-dependent parameters: particle surface-to-cell membrane
   contact area, i.e., particle-cell adhesion, strain energy for membrane
   deformation, and sedimentation or local particle concentration at the
   cell membrane. These studies provide a fundamental understanding on how
   nanoparticle uptake in different mammalian cells is influenced by the
   nanoscale geometry and is critical for designing improved nanocarriers
   and predicting nanomaterial toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Ordered, fibrous, self-seeding aggregates of misfolded proteins known as
   amyloids are associated with important diseases in mammals and control
   phenotypic traits in fungi. A given protein may adopt multiple amyloid
   conformations, known as variants or strains, each of which leads to a
   distinct disease pattern or phenotype. Here, we study the effect of
   Hofmeister ions on amyloid nucleation and strain generation by the prion
   domain-containing fragment (Sup35NM) of a yeast protein Sup35p. Strongly
   hydrated anions (kosmotropes) initiate nucleation quickly and cause
   rapid fiber elongation, whereas poorly hydrated anions (chaotropes)
   delay nucleation and mildly affect the elongation rate. For the first
   time, we demonstrate that kosmotropes favor formation of amyloid strains
   that are characterized by lower thermostability and higher frangibility
   in vitro and stronger phenotypic and proliferation patterns effectively
   in vivo as compared with amyloids formed in chaotropes. These phenomena
   point to inherent differences in the biochemistry of Hofmeister ions.
   Our work shows that the ionic composition of a solution not only
   influences the kinetics of amyloid nucleation but also determines the
   amyloid strain that is preferentially formed.}},

Abstract = {{When platelets are strongly stimulated, a procoagulant platelet
   subpopulation is formed that is characterized by phosphatidylserine (PS)
   exposure and epitope modulation of integrin (IIb3) or a loss of binding
   of activation-dependent antibodies. Mitochondrial permeability
   transition pore (mPTP) formation, which is essential for the formation
   of procoagulant platelets, is impaired in the absence of cyclophilin D
   (CypD). Here we investigate the mechanisms responsible for these
   procoagulant platelet-associated changes in integrin (IIb3) and the
   physiologic role of procoagulant platelet formation in the regulation of
   platelet aggregation. Among strongly stimulated adherent platelets,
   integrin (IIb3) epitope changes, mPTP formation, PS exposure, and
   platelet rounding were closely associated. Furthermore, platelet mPTP
   formation resulted in a decreased ability to recruit additional
   platelets. In the absence of CypD, integrin (IIb3) function was
   accentuated in both static and flow conditions, and, in vivo, a
   prothrombotic phenotype occurred in mice with a platelet-specific
   deficiency of CypD. CypD-dependent proteolytic events, including
   cleavage of the integrin (3) cytoplasmic domain, coincided closely with
   integrin (IIb3) inactivation. Calpain inhibition blocked integrin (3)
   cleavage and inactivation but not mPTP formation or PS exposure,
   indicating that integrin inactivation and PS exposure are mediated by
   distinct pathways subsequent to mPTP formation. mPTP-dependent
   alkalinization occurred in procoagulant platelets, suggesting a possible
   alternative mechanism for enhancement of calpain activity in
   procoagulant platelets. Together, these results indicate that, in
   strongly stimulated platelets, mPTP formation initiates the
   calpain-dependent cleavage of integrin (3) and associated regulatory
   proteins, resulting in integrin (IIb3) inactivation, and demonstrate a
   novel CypD-dependent negative feedback mechanism that limits platelet
   aggregation and thrombotic occlusion.}},

Abstract = {{Uncrimping of collagen fibers in the arterial wall is an integral
   process in regulating the macro-level mechanical response of arteries.
   Uncrimping of collagen fibers leads to a gradual, but significant
   strain-stiffening response of the artery at physiological pressures and
   prevents overdistention at elevated pressures. In this study, we imaged
   adventitial collagen fibers from fresh primate arteries using two-photon
   excitation microscopy while subjecting the arteries to physiological
   inflation pressures and axial stretches. The imaging focal plane was
   fixed at a constant radial location in the adventitial wall by adjusting
   the focal distance as the arteries inflated, allowing for the
   continuously monitoring of the uncrimping process of a single region of
   collagen fibers. Digital image correlation was then applied to the
   sequential images to assess and correlate the local displacements to
   manual traces of selected reference fibers and their engagements. We
   found that the collagen fibers of interest became fully engaged at a
   luminal pressure of 20 mmHg, this was then followed by rotation of these
   fibers as the bulk artery continued to dilate. This technique helps to
   further the understanding of the uncrimping process of collagen fibers
   under physiological loads, which can aid in the development of more
   accurate microstructural constitutive models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work reports the gas separation performance of several 6FDA-based
   polyimides with different chemical structures, to correlate chemical
   structure with gas transport properties with a special focus on CO2 and
   CH4 transport and plasticization stability of the polyimides membranes
   relevant to natural gas purification. The consideration of the other
   gases (He, O-2 and N-2) provided additional insights regarding effects
   of backbone structure on detailed penetrant properties. The polyimides
   studied include 6FDA-DAM, 6FDA-mPDA, 6FDA-DABA, 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2),
   6FDA-DAM:mPDA (3:2) and 6FDA-mPDA:DABA (3:2). Both pure and binary gas
   permeation were investigated. The packing density, which is tunable by
   adjusting monomer type and composition of the various samples,
   correlated with transport permeability and selectivity. The separation
   performance of the polyimides for various gas pairs were also plotted
   for comparison to the upper bound curves, and it was found that this
   family of materials shows attractive performance. The CO2 plasticization
   responses for the un-cross-linked polyimides showed good plasticization
   resistance to CO2/CH4 mixed gas with 10\% CO2; however, only the
   cross-linked polyimides showed good plasticization resistance under
   aggressive gas feed conditions (CO2/CH4 mixed gas with 50\% CO2 or pure
   CO2). For future work, asymmetric hollow fibers and carbon molecular
   sieve membranes based on the most attractive members of the family will
   be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Detection and quantification of ionophore antibiotics in runoff, soil
   and poultry litter}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1312}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Ionophore antibiotics (IPAs) are widely used as coccidiostats in poultry
   and other livestock industries to promote growth and prevent infections.
   Because most of the ingested IPAs are excreted in poultry litter, which
   is primarily applied as grassland fertilizer, a significant amount of
   IPAs can be released into the litter-soil-water environment. A robust
   analytical method has been developed to quantify IPAs (monensin (MON),
   salinomycin (SAL) and narasin (NAR)) in complex environmental
   compartments including surface runoff, soil and poultry litter, with
   success to minimize matrix interference. The method for water samples
   involves solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid-liquid
   extraction (LLE) post-clean up steps. The method for solid samples
   involves bi-solvent LLE. IPAs were detected by HPLC-MS, with optimized
   parameters to achieve the highest sensitivity. Nigericin (NIG), an IPA
   not used in livestock industry, is successfully applied and validated as
   a surrogate standard. The method recoveries were at 92-95\% and 81-85\%
   in runoff samples from unfertilized and litter-fertilized fields,
   respectively. For solids, the method recoveries were at 93-99\% in
   soils, and 79-83\% in poultry litter samples. SAL was detected at up to
   22 mg/kg and MON and NAR at up to 4 mg/kg in broiler litter from
   different farms. Up to 183 1.1 mu g/kg of MON was detected in
   litter-fertilized soils. All three IPAs were detected in the rainfall
   runoff from litter-fertilized lands at concentrations up to 9 mu g/L.

Pages = {{1950-1958}},

Abstract = {{Formation control for a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)
   is challenging due to the complex systems dynamics and time delay in the
   cooperative feedback loops. This paper introduces a decoupled design
   procedure, so that formation controllers designed for particle dynamics
   can be generalised to formation controllers for fully actuated AUVs with
   six-degree-of-freedom dynamic models for motions in three-dimensional
   space. The orientation control and the translation control are first
   decoupled following a standard inner-outer loop approach. Then, a
   geometric approach is followed to separate the translation dynamics into
   formation shape dynamics and formation centre dynamics. Coupling terms
   between the two portions of the dynamics are treated as perturbations
   and are tolerated by a robust formation-keeping controller. The
   controller is also robust to constant bounded time delays. This
   decoupling procedure simplified the entire design process comparing with
   other existing approaches with similar goals. Both rigorous theoretical
   analysis and simulation results are presented to justify the
   effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{The surface species formed by glycerol on gamma-Al2O3, TiO2 anatase,
   ZrO2, MgO, and CeO2 both in the presence and in the absence of bulk
   water are investigated with infrared spectroscopy. The acid-base
   properties of the metal oxides are characterized by pyridine and CO2
   adsorption/temperature-programmed desorption. The metal oxides studied
   provide a distribution of strengths of Lewis acid sites as well as
   strengths and types of basic sites which afford insight into the role of
   these various sites in polyol/metal oxide surface interactions. Even in
   the presence of bulk water, glycerol forms a bridging alkoxy bond
   through a primary alcohol group to two coordinatively unsaturated metal
   atoms and participates in a Lewis acid/base interaction between the
   oxygen atom of the other primary alcohol and a coordinatively
   unsaturated metal atom that is also involved in the alkoxy bond. These
   interactions only occur with metal oxides which contain strong Lewis
   acid sites. A quantitative correlation between the C-O stretching
   frequencies of the chemisorbed groups and the electronegativity of the
   metal atoms is established. Glycerol experiences an additional surface
   interaction via a hydrogen-bonding interaction between its secondary
   alcohol group and a relatively weak basic surface oxygen atom. Stronger
   base sites are blocked by adsorbed water or CO2. In the absence of
   strong Lewis acid sites, in the case of MgO, hydrogen-bonding
   interactions between glycerol and surface hydroxyls are the dominant
   means of interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormal cell mechanical stiffness can point to the development of
   various diseases including cancers and infections. We report a new
   microfluidic technique for continuous cell separation utilizing
   variation in cell stiffness. We use a microfluidic channel decorated by
   periodic diagonal ridges that compress the flowing cells in rapid
   succession. The compression in combination with secondary flows in the
   ridged microfluidic channel translates each cell perpendicular to the
   channel axis in proportion to its stiffness. We demonstrate the physical
   principle of the cell sorting mechanism and show that our microfluidic
   approach can be effectively used to separate a variety of cell types
   which are similar in size but of different stiffnesses, spanning a range
   from 210 Pa to 23 kPa. Atomic force microscopy is used to directly
   measure the stiffness of the separated cells and we found that the
   trajectories in the microchannel correlated to stiffness. We have
   demonstrated that the current processing throughput is 250 cells per
   second. This microfluidic separation technique opens new ways for
   conducting rapid and low-cost cell analysis and disease diagnostics

Abstract = {{The development of a direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry
   (DART-MS) method and first prototype vaporizer for the detection of low
   molecular weight (similar to 30-100 Da) contaminants representative of
   those detected in water samples from the International Space Station is
   reported. A temperature-programmable, electro-thermal vaporizer (ETV)
   was designed, constructed, and evaluated as a sampling interface for
   DART-MS. The ETV facilitates analysis of water samples with minimum user
   intervention while maximizing analytical sensitivity and sample
   throughput. The integrated DART-ETV-MS methodology was evaluated in both
   positive and negative ion modes to (1) determine experimental conditions
   suitable for coupling DART with ETV as a sample inlet and ionization
   platform for time-of-flight MS, (2) to identify analyte response ions,
   (3) to determine the detection limit and dynamic range for target
   analyte measurement, and (4) to determine the reproducibility of
   measurements made with the method when using manual sample introduction
   into the vaporizer. Nitrogen was used as the DART working gas, and the
   target analytes chosen for the study were ethyl acetate, acetone,
   acetaldehyde, ethanol, ethylene glycol, dimethylsilanediol,
   formaldehyde, isopropanol, methanol, methylethyl ketone, methylsulfone,
   propylene glycol, and trimethylsilanol.}},

Abstract = {{Shigellosis, a diarrheal disease, is endemic worldwide and is
   responsible for approximately 15,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in the
   United States every year. However, patients with shigellosis often do
   not seek medical care. To estimate the burden of shigellosis, we
   extended time-series susceptible-infected-recovered models to infer
   epidemiologic parameters from underreported case data. We applied the
   time-series susceptible-infected-recoveredbased inference schemes to
   analyze the largest surveillance data set of Shigella sonnei in the
   United States from 1967 to 2007 with county-level resolution. The
   dynamics of shigellosis transmission show strong annual and multiyear
   cycles, as well as seasonality. By using the schemes, we inferred
   individual-level parameters of shigellosis infection, including seasonal
   transmissibilities and basic reproductive number (R-0). In addition,
   this study provides quantitative estimates of the reporting rate,
   suggesting that the shigellosis burden in the United States may be more
   than 10 times the number of laboratory-confirmed cases. Although the
   estimated reporting rate is generally under 20, and R-0 is generally
   under 1.5, there is a strong negative correlation between estimates of
   the reporting rate and R-0. Such negative correlations are likely to
   pose identifiability problems in underreported diseases. We discuss
   complementary approaches that might further disentangle the true
   reporting rate and R-0.}},

Abstract = {{Patterned MWCNT/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposite strain sensors
   were achieved by a microelectromechanical system assisted
   electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. With the combined effect of
   superior intrinsic piezoresistivity of the individual MWCNT and the
   tunneling effect of the MWCNT network, the stretchable composite
   demonstrates high sensitivity to the tensile strain. The gauge factor
   shows a strong dependence on both the initial resistance of the CNT/PDMS
   composite and the applied strain level. The mechanism is elucidated by
   analyzing the structure-property-function of patterned CNT networks.
   When the entanglement of a MWCNT network allows effective load transfer,
   the sensitivity is primarily dominated by the intrinsic piezoresistivity
   of individual MWCNTs. Conversely, when the MWCNTs interpenetrate
   loosely, the tunneling effect prevails. The sensitivity of the device
   can be tailored by the proposed technique since MWCNT film
   thickness/density can be readily controlled by means of the patterning
   parameters of the EPD process. The work provides useful guidance for
   design and development of strain/stress sensors with targeted
   sensitivity for flexible electronics applications. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{We propose a joint digital preequalization scheme for a Nyquist

   implemented before the reference-based preequalization scheme to enhance

   experiment illustrates eight-channel digital-analog-converter generation
   of the polarization division multiplexing quadrature phase shift keying
   system at 112 Gb/s per channel on a 25-GHz grid, adopting the
   reference-based digital preequalization considering narrow-band optical
   filtering effect at the transmitter. The experimental results show that
   the proposed preequalization scheme allows for an ultradense channel
   spacing of 0.89 times of the baud rate in the super N-WDM system with a

Abstract = {{This article describes a shooting method for computing three-dimensional
   equilibria of pre-curved non-linear beams with axial and shear
   flexibility using the intrinsic beam formulation. For distributed and
   concentrated follower loads acting on a cantilevered beam, the method
   amounts to a direct solution approach requiring only a single shot (zero
   iterations) to compute the equilibria. This is possible since the system
   equations are defined in a local coordinate system that rotates and
   translates with the beam, akin to the follower loads themselves. A
   general procedure employing nonconservative follower loads, which
   invokes the Picard-Lindelof theorem on uniqueness and existence of
   solutions, is also introduced for finding all solutions for
   three-dimensional pre-curved beam problems with conservative loading.
   This is particularly useful in beam buckling problems where multiple
   stable and unstable solutions exist. Three-dimensional equilibrium
   solutions are generated for many loading cases and boundary conditions,
   including three-dimensional helical beams, and are compared to similar
   solutions where available in the literature. Excellent agreement is
   documented in all comparison cases. For buckling examples, the stability
   of the computed solutions is assessed using a dynamic finite element
   code based on the same intrinsic beam equations. Due to the ability to
   avoid iteration, the presented approach may find application in
   model-based control for practical three-dimensional problems such as the
   control of manipulators utilized in endoscopic surgeries and the control
   of spacecraft with robotic arms and long cables. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{The brain must dynamically integrate, coordinate, and respond to
   internal and external stimuli across multiple time scales. Non-invasive
   measurements of brain activity with fMRI have greatly advanced our
   understanding of the large-scale functional organization supporting
   these fundamental features of brain function. Conclusions from previous
   resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of
   functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to
   capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal
   features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic
   FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns
   underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though
   limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here, we
   review recent findings, methodological considerations, neural and

Abstract = {{Mapping anatomical brain networks with graph-theoretic analysis of
   diffusion tractography has recently gained popularity, because of its
   presumed value in understanding brain function. However, this approach
   has seldom been used to compare brain connectomes across species, which
   may provide insights into brain evolution. Here, we employed a
   data-driven approach to compare interregional brain connections across
   three primate species: 1) the intensively studied rhesus macaque, 2) our
   closest living primate relative, the chimpanzee, and 3) humans.
   Specifically, we first used random parcellations and surface-based
   probabilistic diffusion tractography to derive the brain networks of the
   three species under various network densities and resolutions. We then
   compared the characteristics of the networks using graph-theoretic
   measures. In rhesus macaques, our tractography-defined hubs showed
   reasonable overlap with hubs previously identified using anterograde and
   retrograde tracer data. Across all three species, hubs were largely
   symmetric in the two hemispheres and were consistently identified in
   medial parietal, insular, retrosplenial cingulate and ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortices, suggesting a conserved structural architecture
   within these regions. However, species differences were observed in the
   inferior parietal cortex, polar and medial prefrontal cortices. The
   potential significance of these interspecies differences is discussed.

Abstract = {{A new class of positive tone, permanent materials has been demonstrated,
   which are chemically amplified (CA), aqueousdevelopable, and
   cross-linkable. The intended purpose is a patterning and cross-linking
   method to create high sensitivity permanent dielectrics for
   microelectronic devices and packages. The photochemistry is based on
   traditional CA, acid-catalyzed deprotection of a protected organic
   functionality to yield an aqueous base soluble group such as a
   carboxylic acid or alcohol. This CA chemistry produces high contrast and
   high photo-speed patterning, which is especially valuable for thick-film
   applications where high UV exposure doses are required for non-CA
   materials. The photospeed is about an order of magnitude faster than
   commercial materials at a similar thickness. Subsequent to patterning,
   the remaining films or features can be cross-linked by a variety of
   chemical mechanisms. The working photo-patterning and cross-linking
   mechanisms are demonstrated on a random copolymer of tert-butyl
   methacrylate (TBMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). The optical
   contrast (at 248 nm) was found to be 12.7 and the sensitivity, D-100,
   was calculated to be 50.2 mJ/cm(2) in a 9.07-lm-thick film. Undeveloped
   regions were cross-linked after patterning. The esterification reaction
   is much slower than the TBMA deprotection, so that the cross-linking
   reaction does not interfere with the photopatterning. Cross-linking was
   also evident by the change in thin film stress 6.2 to 17.9 MPa during a
   thermal cure. Other polymers for Fischer esterification are discussed
   with their advantages and disadvantages along with other cross-linking
   chemistries. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The high field properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) network thin film
   transistors (CN-TFTs) are important for their practical operation, and
   for understanding their reliability. Using a combination of experimental
   and computational techniques we show how the channel geometry (length
   L-C and width W-C) and network morphology (average CNT length L-t and
   alignment angle distribution theta) affect heat dissipation and high
   field breakdown in such devices. The results suggest that when W-C >=
   L-t, the breakdown voltage remains independent of W-C but varies
   linearly with L-C. The breakdown power varies almost linearly with both
   W-C and L-C when W-C >> L-t. We also find that the breakdown power is
   more susceptible to the variability in the network morphology compared
   to the breakdown voltage. The analysis offers new insight into the
   tunable heat dissipation and thermal reliability of CN-TFTs, which can
   be significantly improved through optimization of the network morphology
   and device geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that govern the thermodynamic stability of
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical to the development of these
   materials. In this work we present the first theoretical investigation
   of the stability of MOF polymorphs under solvothermal conditions. We
   combine thermodynamic integration (TI) and osmotic framework adsorbed
   solution theory (OFAST) calculations to reliably predict the free energy
   of immersion, Delta G(imm), of MOFs. We also demonstrate that the
   configurational free energy can be estimated in the harmonic
   approximation from the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of the
   framework. This approach is applied to a set of hypothetical Zn(mIm)(2)
   polymorphs under ambient conditions using methanol as the solvent to
   mimic the actual solvothermal synthesis conditions for ZIF-8. Our
   simulations predict that the relative contribution of Delta G(imm) to
   the framework stability is minor compared to the configurational free
   energy relative to the most stable structure for all polymorphs.
   However, we also find that solvation affects the energetic ordering of
   metastable polymorphs. We observe good agreement between predictions of
   Delta G(imm) using the OFAST method and those using the more rigorous TI
   calculations. The methods developed in this work can be applied to study
   the effect of the interplay between structural topology, solvent, and
   temperature on the thermodynamic stability of the framework for a wide
   range of nanoporous materials.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the experimental characterizations, including thermochemical

   associates are assumed to exist, respectively. The binary
   intermetallics, i.e. Na3Sb, NaSb, K3Sb, K5Sb4, KSb and KSb2 are modeled
   as stoichiometric phases. Such models allow the peculiarities of related
   thermochemical properties and phase diagrams to be well reproduced,
   especially for the V-shaped enthalpies/entropies of mixing, abrupt
   changes in activity plots and sharp liquidus around Na3Sb, KSb and K3Sb
   intermetallics. Although the experimental data are scattered to some
   extent, the thermodynamic descriptions provided in this work can
   satisfactorily represent a great majority of such measured quantities.

Abstract = {{The discovery of air-stable n-dopants for organic semiconductor
   materials has been hindered by the necessity of high-energy HOMOs and
   the air sensitivity of compounds that satisfy this requirement. One
   strategy for circumventing this problem is to utilize stable precursor
   molecules that form the active doping complex in situ during the doping
   process or in a postdeposition thermal- or photo-activation step. Some
   of us have reported on the use of 1H-benzimidazole (DMBI) and
   benzimidazolium (DMBI-I) salts as solution- and vacuum-processable
   n-type dopant precursors, respectively. It was initially suggested that
   DMBI dopants function as single-electron radical donors wherein the
   active doping species, the imidazoline radical, is generated in a
   postdeposition thermal annealing step. Herein we report the results of
   extensive mechanistic studies on DMBI-doped fullerenes, the results of
   which suggest a more complicated doping mechanism is operative.
   Specifically, a reaction between the dopant and host that begins with
   either hydride or hydrogen atom transfer and which ultimately leads to
   the formation of host radical anions is responsible for the doping
   effect. The results of this research will be useful for identifying
   applications of current organic n-doping technology and will drive the
   design of next-generation n-type dopants that are air stable and capable
   of doping low-electron-affinity host materials in organic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The widely used dynamic mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) suffers
   severe sensitivity degradation and noise increase when operated in
   liquid. The large hydrodynamic drag between the oscillating AFM
   cantilever and the surrounding liquid overwhelms the dissipative
   tip-sample interaction forces that are employed for nanomechanical
   imaging. In this article, we show that the recently developed
   Trolling-Mode AFM based on a nanoneedle probe can resolve nanomechanical
   properties on soft samples in liquid, enabled by the significantly
   reduced hydrodynamic drag between the cantilever and the liquid. The
   performance of the method was demonstrated by mapping mechanical
   properties of the membrane of living HeLa cells. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Measurement of optic nerve head (ONH) deformations could be useful in
   the clinical management of glaucoma. Here, we propose a novel
   three-dimensional tissue-tracking algorithm designed to be used in vivo.
   We carry out preliminary verification of the algorithm by testing its
   accuracy and its robustness. An algorithm based on digital volume
   correlation was developed to extract ONH tissue displacements from two
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes of the ONH (undeformed and
   deformed). The algorithm was tested by applying artificial deformations
   to a baseline OCT scan while manipulating speckle noise, illumination
   and contrast enhancement. Tissue deformations determined by our
   algorithm were compared with the known (imposed) values. Errors in
   displacement magnitude, orientation and strain decreased with signal
   averaging and were 0.15 mu m, 0.15 degrees and 0.0019, respectively (for
   optimized algorithm parameters). Previous computational work suggests
   that these errors are acceptable to provide in vivo characterization of
   ONH biomechanics. Our algorithm is robust to OCT speckle noise as well
   as to changes in illumination conditions, and increasing signal
   averaging can produce better results. This algorithm has potential be
   used to quantify ONH three-dimensional strains in vivo, of benefit in
   the diagnosis and identification of risk factors in glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of the performance of absorption systems during such
   transient operations as start-up and shut-down to minimize lifetime
   costs is particularly important for small-capacity chillers and heat
   pumps. Dynamic models in the literature have been used to study
   responses to step changes in single parameters, but more complex
   transient processes, such as system start-up, have not been studied in
   detail. A robust system-level model for simulating the transient
   behavior of an absorption chiller was developed here. Individual heat
   and mass exchangers were modeled using detailed segmental models. System
   parameters used in the model were representative of a 1-RT (3.5-kW
   cooling) absorption chiller currently under development. Representative
   simulations were performed for the full cold start-up process and for
   system responses to step changes in the desorber coupling-fluid
   temperature and valve settings. Results from this analysis can be used
   to optimize start-up and steady-state performances.}},

Abstract = {{A wearable cooling system was developed for use in elevated temperature
   environments by military, fire-fighting, chemical-response, and other
   hazardous duty personnel. The cooling system consists of an
   engine-driven R134a vapor compression system assembled in a backpack
   configuration, coupled with a cooling garment containing refrigerant
   lines. A 2.0 L fuel tank powers a small-scale engine that runs a
   compressor fabricated in house. The overall cooling system, including
   the wearable evaporator, had a mass of 5.31 kg and measured 0.318 x
   0.273 x 0.152 m. Controlled environment tests determined system
   performance over a range of ambient temperatures (37.7-47.5 degrees C),
   evaporator refrigerant temperatures (22.2-26.1 degrees C), and engine
   speeds (10,500-13,300 RPM). Heat removal rates of up to 300 W, which is
   the cooling rate for maintaining comfort at an activity level comparable
   to calisthenics or moderate exercise, were demonstrated at an ambient
   temperature of 43.3 degrees C. The system consumed 1750 W at a fuel flow
   rate of 0.316 kg h(-1) to provide a 178 W of cooling for 5.7 h. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{New helicopter rotor designs are desired that offer increased
   efficiency, reduced vibration, and reduced noise. Multidisciplinary
   optimization of rotors has been advanced by the development of
   ``comprehensive{''} rotorcraft analysis tools; however, these tools lack
   built-in high-fidelity aerodynamic models. Accurate airload predictions
   utilize computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled to the computational
   structural dynamics (CSD) of a comprehensive code. These methods are too
   computationally intensive for numerous function calls as in
   optimization. Thus, an approach is needed where high-fidelity
   simulations can be routinely used in optimization. The process presented
   in this paper combines the results of a simplified aerodynamic
   low-fidelity simulation with a selected number of high-fidelity CFD/CSD
   simulations. The process is demonstrated for a four-bladed hingeless
   rotor. Design variables include tip geometry and spanwise twist.
   Approximation models are built for high-fidelity metrics for rotor
   efficiency and vibration. Optimization using these approximation models
   found a design having maximum rotor efficiency while constraining
   vibration.}},

Abstract = {{Pd icosahedra with sizes controlled in the range of 5-35 nm were
   synthesized in high purity through a combination of polyol reduction and
   seed-mediated growth. The Pd icosahedra were obtained with purity >94\%
   and uniform sizes controlled in the range of 5-17 nm by using ethylene
   glycol as both the reductant and solvent. The studies indicate that the
   formation of Pd nanocrystals with an icosahedral shape was very
   sensitive to the reaction kinetics. The success of this synthesis relies
   on the use of HCl to manipulate the reaction kinetics and thus control
   the twin structure and shape of the resultant nanocrystals. The size of
   the Pd icosahedra could be further increased up to 35 nm by
   seed-mediated growth, with 17 nm Pd icosahedra serving as seeds. The
   multiply twinned Pd icosahedra could grow into larger sizes, and their
   shape and multiply twinned structure were preserved. Thanks to the
   presence of twin defects, the Pd icosahedra showed a catalytic current
   density towards formic-acid oxidation that was 1.9 and 11.6 times higher
   than that of single-crystal Pd octahedra, which were also fully covered
   by \{111\} facets, and commercial Pd/C, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Extremely low frequency/very low frequency (ELF/VLF) radio waves are
   difficult to generate with conventional antennas. Ionospheric high
   frequency (HF) heating facilities generate ELF/VLF waves via modulated
   heating of the lower ionosphere. HF heating of the ionosphere changes
   the lower ionospheric conductivity, which in the presence of natural
   currents such as the auroral electrojet creates an antenna in the sky
   when heating is modulated at ELF/VLF frequencies. We present a summary
   of nearly 100days of ELF/VLF wave generation experiments at the 3.6MW
   High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility near
   Gakona, Alaska, at a variety of ELF/VLF frequencies, seasons, and times
   of day. We present comprehensive statistics of generated ELF/VLF
   magnetic fields observed at a nearby site, in the 500-3500 Hz band.
   Transmissions with a specific HF beam configuration (3.25 MHz, vertical
   beam, amplitude modulation) are isolated so the data comparison is
   self-consistent, across nearly 5 million individual measurements of
   either a tone or a piece of a frequency-time ramp. There is a minimum in
   the average generation close to local midnight. It is found that
   generation during local nighttime is on average weaker but more highly
   variable, with a small number of very strong generation periods. Signal
   amplitudes from day to day may vary by as much as 20-30dB. Generation
   strengthens by approximate to 5dB during the first approximate to 30min
   of transmission, which may be a signature of slow electron density
   changes from sustained HF heating. Theoretical calculations are made to
   relate the amplitude observed to the power injected into the waveguide
   and reaching 250 km. The median power generated by HAARP and injected
   into the waveguide is approximate to 0.05-0.1 W in this baseline
   configuration (vertical beam, 3.25 MHz, amplitude modulation) but may
   have generated hundreds of watts for brief durations. Several efficiency
   improvements have improved the ELF/VLF wave generation efficiency
   further.}},

Abstract = {{Low-impact development (LID) is an innovative stormwater management
   strategy that restores the predevelopment hydrology to prevent increased
   stormwater runoff from land development. Integrating LID into
   residential subdivisions and increasing population density by building
   more compact living spaces (e.g., apartment homes) can result in a more
   sustainable city by reducing stormwater runoff, saving infrastructural
   cost, increasing the number of affordable homes, and supporting public
   transportation. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) that describes the
   interactions between several decision-makers (i.e., local government, a
   developer, and homebuyers) and fiscal drivers (e.g., property taxes,
   impact fees). The model simulates the development of nine square miles
   of greenfield land. A more sustainable development (MSD) scenario
   introduces an impact fee that developers must pay if they choose not to
   use LID to build houses or apartment homes. Model simulations show
   homeowners selecting apartment homes 60\% or 35\% of the time after 30
   years of development in MSD or business as usual (BAU) scenarios,
   respectively. The increased adoption of apartment homes results from the
   lower cost of using LID and improved quality of life for apartment homes
   relative to single-family homes. The MSD scenario generates more tax
   revenue and water savings than does BAU. A time-dependent global
   sensitivity analysis quantifies the importance of socioeconomic
   variables on the adoption rate of apartment homes. The top influential
   factors are the annual pay rates (or capital recovery factor) for
   single-family houses and apartment homes. The ABM can be used by city
   managers and policymakers for scenario exploration in accordance with
   local conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of impact fees and other
   policies in promoting LID and compact growth.}},

Abstract = {{Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) strains are keystone bacteria for
   reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes to nontoxic ethene in
   contaminated aquifers. Enumeration of Dhc biomarker genes using
   quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in groundwater is a key component of
   site assessment and bioremediation monitoring. Unfortunately,
   standardized qPCR procedures that recognize impaired measurements due to
   PCR inhibition, low template DNA concentrations, or analytical error are
   not available, thus limiting confidence in qPCR data. To improve
   contemporary approaches for enumerating Dhc in environmental samples,
   multiplex qPCR assays were designed to quantify the Dhc 16S rRNA gene
   and one of two different internal amplification controls (IACs): a
   modified Dhc 16S rRNA gene fragment (Dhc{*}) and the firefly luciferase
   gene luc. The Dhc{*} IAC exhibited competitive inhibition in qPCR with
   the Dhc 16S rRNA gene template when the ratio of either target was
   100-fold greater than the other target. A multiplex qPCR assay with the
   luc IAC avoided competitive inhibition and accurately quantified Dhc
   abundances ranging from similar to 10 to 10(7) 16S rRNA gene copies per
   reaction. The addition of similar to 10(6) E. coli luc IAC to simulated
   groundwater amended with the Dhc-containing consortium KB-1 yielded
   reproducible luc counts after DNA extraction and multiplex qPCR
   enumeration. The application of the luc IAC assay improved Dhc biomarker
   gene quantification from simulated groundwater samples and is a valuable
   approach for ``ground truthing{''} qPCR data obtained in different
   laboratories, thus reducing ambiguity associated with qPCR enumeration
   and reproducibility.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic embryogenesis (SE) represents a useful experimental system for
   studying the regulatory mechanisms of embryo development. In this study,
   the effect of carbohydrates and osmoticum on storage reserve
   accumulation and germination of Norway spruce {[}Picea abies (L.) Karst]
   somatic embryos were investigated. Using time lapse photography, we
   monitored development from proliferation of proembryogenic masses (PEMs)
   to maturation of somatic embryos in two P. abies cell lines cultured on
   two maturation treatments. A combination of sugar assays, metabolic and
   proteomic analyses were used to quantify storage reserves in the mature
   somatic embryos. The maturation treatment containing a nonpermeating
   osmoticum, polyethylene glycol (PEG, 7.5\%) and maltose (3\%) as the
   carbohydrate gave significantly high maturation and low germination
   frequencies of somatic embryos compared to the treatment with only 3\%
   sucrose. Somatic embryos treated with 3\% sucrose contained high levels
   of sucrose, raffinose and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins.
   These compounds are known to be involved in the acquisition of
   desiccation tolerance during seed development and maturation. In
   addition the sucrose treatment significantly increased the content of
   starch in the somatic embryos while the maltose and PEG treatment
   resulted in somatic embryos with a high content of storage proteins. The
   high levels of sucrose, raffinose and LEA proteins in the embryos
   treated with 3\% sucrose suggest that sucrose may improve the
   germination of somatic embryos by promoting the acquisition of
   desiccation tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{A novel algorithm is developed for feature selection and parameter
   tuning in quality monitoring of manufacturing processes using
   cross-validation. Due to the recent development in sensing technology,
   many on-line signals are collected for manufacturing process monitoring
   and feature extraction is then performed to extract critical features
   related to product/process quality. However, lack of precise process
   knowledge may result in many irrelevant or redundant features.
   Therefore, a systematic procedure is needed to select a parsimonious set
   of features which provide sufficient information for process monitoring.
   In this study, a new method for selecting features and tuning SPC limits
   is proposed by applying k-fold cross-validation to simultaneously select
   important features and set the monitoring limits using Type I and Type
   II errors obtained from cross-validation. The monitoring performance for
   production data collected from ultrasonic metal welding of batteries
   demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is able to select the most
   efficient features and control limits and thus leading to satisfactory
   monitoring performance. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Abstract = {{(111)-oriented epitaxial thin films of nickel ferrite (NFO) are grown on
   c-plane sapphire {[}-Al2O3(0001)] substrates using a chemical solution
   deposition technique. The processing conditions, including pyrolysis and

   texture and epitaxy. It is shown that increasing the pyrolysis
   temperature to 400 degrees C and decreasing the annealing temperature to
   750 degrees C for 10min result in the highest degree of texture in the
   films. Lower film thickness also leads to a higher degree of texture.

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging problems in the development of
   lithium-sulfur batteries is polysulfide dissolution, which leads to cell
   overcharge and low columbic efficiency. Here, we propose the formation
   of a thin conformal Li-ion permeable oxide layer on the sulfur-carbon
   composite electrode surface by rapid plasma enhanced atomic layer
   deposition (PEALD) in order to prevent this dissolution, while
   preserving electrical connectivity within the individual electrode
   particles. PEALD synthesis offers a fast deposition rate combined with a
   low operating temperature, which allows sulfur evaporation during
   deposition to be avoided. After PEALD of a thin layer of aluminium oxide
   on the surface of electrode composed of large (ca. 10 mu m in diameter)
   S-infiltrated activated carbon fibers (S-ACF), significantly enhanced
   cycle life is observed, with a capacity in excess of 600 mAhg(-1) after
   300 charge-discharge cycles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows a
   significant amount of redeposited lithium sulfides on the external
   surface of regular S-ACF electrodes. However, the PEALD alumina-coated
   electrodes show no lithium sulfide deposits on the fiber surface. Energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) studies of the electrodes' chemical
   composition further confirms that PEALD alumina coatings dramatically
   reduce S dissolution from the cathodes by confining the polysulfides
   inside the alumina barrier.}},

Title = {{A videogrammetric as-built data collection method for digital

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{A roofing contractor typically needs to acquire as-built dimensions of a
   roof structure several times over the course of its build because a
   structure is never built to the exact drawing dimensions. In the
   construction phase and in order to digitally fabricate sheet metal roof
   panels, the contractor has to measure end-to-end dimensions of
   boundaries of every roof plane with a certain level of accuracy (i.e.,
   errors less than +/-2 cm). This is necessary to be able to cut sheet
   metal coil such that different pieces perfectly fit together. Obtaining
   these measurements using the exiting roof surveying methods could be
   costly in terms of equipment, labor, and/or worker exposure to safety
   hazards. This paper presents a video-based surveying framework as an
   alternative method which is simple to use, automated, less expensive,
   and safe. When using this framework, the contractor collects video
   streams with a calibrated stereo camera set. The captured data is
   processed to automatically generate a 3D wire-diagram of the target
   roof. Measurements from the wire-diagram are saved in a digital file
   (XML format) which could be loaded into an on-site sheet metal folding
   and cutting machine. Experimental analyses demonstrate applicability of
   the proposed framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inactivation of selected neurons in vivo can define their contribution
   to specific developmental outcomes, circuit functions, and behaviors.
   Here, we show that the optogenetic tool KillerRed selectively, rapidly,
   and permanently inactivates different classes of neurons in C. elegans
   in response to a single light stimulus, through the generation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ablation scales from individual neurons
   in single animals to multiple neurons in populations and can be applied
   to freely behaving animals. Using spatially restricted illumination, we
   demonstrate that localized KillerRed activation in either the cell body
   or the axon triggers neuronal degeneration and death of the targeted
   cell. Finally, targeting KillerRed to mitochondria results in organelle
   fragmentation without killing the cell, in contrast to the cell death
   observed when KillerRed is targeted to the plasma membrane. We expect
   this genetic tool to have wide-ranging applications in studies of
   circuit function and subcellular responses to ROS.}},

Abstract = {{Overset computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are the most
   sophisticated methods currently available to predict the unsteady motion
   of wind turbine blades without the need for additional simplifications
   or restrictions on the turbine operational conditions. An unstructured
   implementation of the governing equations of motion permits rapid
   modeling of the salient components, such as nacelles, towers and other
   localized obstructions of interest. A time-accurate incompressible
   formulation accelerates the convergence of the solution, in addition to
   eliminating the need for low-Mach number preconditioning, which can be
   problematic and computationally expensive for time-accurate simulations.
   The use of a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes/large eddy
   simulation (RANS/LES) turbulence method is observed to improve the
   prediction and extent of separation, as well as integrated performance
   variables for stalled rotors under fully turbulent conditions. Copyright

Abstract = {{In this paper, a frequency-domain cross-layer collision-tolerant (CT)
   media access control (MAC) scheme is proposed for the up-links of
   broadband wireless networks with asynchronous users. The collision
   tolerance is achieved with a frequency-domain on-off accumulative
   transmission (FD-OOAT) scheme, where the spectrum is divided into a
   large number of orthogonal sub-channels, and each symbol is transmitted
   over a small subset of the sub-channels to reduce collisions. Such a
   radio resource management scheme renders a special signal structure that
   enables multi-user detection (MUD) in the physical layer to resolve the
   collisions at the MAC layer. Most existing MUDs require precise symbol
   level synchronization among users. The proposed scheme, however, can
   operate with asynchronous users. A new theoretical framework is provided
   to study the impacts of time-domain user delays on system performance.
   Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   FD-OOAT structure with time-domain oversampling is robust to user delays
   and the timing phase offset caused by the sampling clock difference
   between the transmitter and the receiver. It is shown that the proposed
   scheme can achieve significant performance gains, in terms of both the
   number of users supported and the normalized throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Current heterogeneous chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) integrate a GPU
   architecture on a die. However, the heterogeneity of this architecture
   inevitably exerts different pressures on shared resource management due
   to differing characteristics of CPU and GPU cores. We consider how to
   efficiently share on-chip resources between cores within the
   heterogeneous system, in particular the on-chip network. Heterogeneous
   architectures use an on-chip interconnection network to access shared
   resources such as last-level cache tiles and memory controllers, and
   this type of on-chip network will have a significant impact on
   performance.
   In this article, we propose a feedback-directed virtual channel
   partitioning (VCP) mechanism for on-chip routers to effectively share
   network bandwidth between CPU and GPU cores in a heterogeneous
   architecture. VCP dedicates a few virtual channels to CPU and GPU
   applications with separate injection queues. The proposed mechanism
   balances on-chip network bandwidth for applications running on CPU and
   GPU cores by adaptively choosing the best partitioning configuration. As
   a result, our mechanism improves system throughput by 15\% over the
   baseline across 39 heterogeneous workloads.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their unique ability to amplify photon energies, upconversion
   (UC) materials are being studied for numerous potential applications to
   light-utilizing technologies. Many such uses of UC demand adequate
   conversion efficiency under low-power, broad spectrum irradiation;
   however, spectroscopic studies of UC phosphors have been most commonly
   conducted using monochromatic laser excitation that is resonant with the
   desired electronic transitions. In this study, we sought to elucidate
   the behavior of UC materials under polychromatic excitation by
   initiating visible-to-UV UC in a Pr3+-doped phosphor under multiple
   combined two-color excitation beams. Several wavelengths of light, which
   were not capable of producing UC emission when used alone, were found to
   contribute to UC when combined with other colors, indicating that
   polychromatic UC mechanisms warrant consideration in applications
   involving broad band excitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nonlinear mechanical systems promise broadband resonance and
   instantaneous hysteretic switching that can be used for high sensitivity
   sensing. However, to introduce nonlinear resonances in widely used
   microcantilever systems, such as MM probes, requires driving the
   cantilever to an amplitude that is too large for any practical
   applications. We introduce a novel design for a microcantilever with a
   strong nonlinearity at small cantilever oscillation amplitude arising
   from the geometrical integration of a single BN nanotube. The dynamics
   of the system was modeled theoretically and confirmed experimentally.
   The system, besides providing a practical design of a nonlinear
   microcantilever-based probe, demonstrates also an effective method of
   studying the nonlinear damping properties of the attached nanotube.
   Beyond the typical linear mechanical damping, the nonlinear damping
   contribution from the attached nanotube was found to be essential for
   understanding the dynamical behavior of the designed system.
   Experimental results obtained through laser microvibrometry validated
   the developed model incorporating the nonlinear damping contribution.}},

Abstract = {{We report human skin based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) that can
   either harvest biomechanical energy or be utilized as a self-powered
   tactile sensor system for touch pad technology. We constructed a TENG
   utilizing the contact/separation between an area of human skin and a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with a surface of micropyramid
   structures, which was attached to an ITO electrode that was grounded
   across a loading resistor. The fabricated TENG delivers an open-circuit
   voltage up to -1000 V, a short-circuit current density of 8 mA/m(2), and
   a power density of 500 mW/m(2) on a load of 100 M Omega, which can be
   used to directly drive tens of green light-emitting diodes. The working
   mechanism of the TENG is based on the charge transfer between the ITO
   electrode and ground via modulating the separation distance between the
   tribo-charged skin patch and PDMS film. Furthermore, the TENG has been
   used in designing an independently addressed matrix for tracking the
   location and pressure of human touch. The fabricated matrix has
   demonstrated its self-powered and high-resolution tactile sensing
   capabilities by recording the output voltage signals as a mapping
   figure, where the detection sensitivity of the pressure is about 0.29
   +/- 0.02 V/kPa and each pixel can have a size of 3 mm x 3 mm. The TENGs
   may have potential applications in human-machine interfacing,
   micro/nano-electromechanical systems, and touch pad technology.}},

Abstract = {{We report a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that plays dual roles as
   a sustainable power source by harvesting wind energy and as a
   self-powered wind vector sensor system for wind speed and direction
   detection. By utilizing the wind-induced resonance vibration of a
   fluorinated ethylene propylene film between two aluminum foils, the
   integrated TENGs with dimensions of 2.5 cm x 2.5 an x 22 cm deliver an
   output voltage up to 100 V, an output current of 1.6 mu A, and a
   corresponding output power of 0.16 mW under an external load of 100 M
   Omega, which can be used to directly light up tens of commercial
   light-emitting diodes. Furthermore, a self-powered wind vector sensor
   system has been developed based on the rationally designed TENGs, which
   is capable of detecting the wind direction and speed with a sensitivity
   of 0.09 mu A/(m/s). This work greatly expands the applicability of TENGs
   as power sources for self-sustained electronics and also self-powered
   sensor systems for ambient wind detection.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, speech scientists have been motivated by the great, success of
   building margin-based classifiers, and have thus proposed novel methods
   to estimate continuous-density hidden Markov model (HMM) for automatic
   speech recognition (ASR) according to the notion that the decision
   boundaries determined by the estimated HMMs attain the maximum
   classification margin as in learning support vector machines. Although a
   good performance has been observed, the margin used in the ASR community
   is often specified as a parameter that has no explicit relationship with
   the HMM parameters. The issues of how the margin is related to the HMM
   parameters and how it directly characterises the generalisation
   capability of HMM-based classifiers have not been addressed so far in
   the community. In this study, the authors attempt to formulate the
   margin used in the soft margin estimation framework as a function of the
   HMM parameters. The key idea is to relate the standard distance-based
   margin with the concept of divergence among competing HMM state Gaussian
   mixture model densities. Experimental results show that the proposed
   model-based margin function is a good indication about the quality of
   HMMs on a given ASR task without the conventional needs of running
   experiments extensively using a separate set of test samples.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical characteristics of a Ti/Al metal contact on Mg-doped
   AlInN/GaN heterostructures were investigated using a transmission line
   model. The as-deposited Ti/Al contact exhibited near Ohmic contact with
   a specific contact resistance of 1.78 x 10(-2) Omega cm(2), while the
   thermal annealing performed at 600 degrees C led to better Ohmic contact
   with a contact resistance of 9.38 x 10(-4) Omega cm(2). This could be
   attributed to the formation of a direct Ohmic path connecting the
   contact and the two-dimensional electron gas beneath an AlInN:Mg barrier
   upon thermal annealing, namely, a spike contact through the indiffusion
   of Al as verified from secondary ion mass spectroscopy.
   Current-voltage-temperature measurements showed an insignificant
   temperature dependence in both the sheet resistance and the contact
   resistance, which seemed to be associated with the distinctive feature
   of the spike contact. (C) 2013 The Japan Society of Applied Physics}},

Abstract = {{The effect of baffle spacing on the hydrodynamics and transport
   characteristics in a scaled variable-baffle-spacing contact tank is
   investigated by employing large-eddy simulation. Simulated solute
   transport is quantitatively validated by comparing simulated and
   measured residence time distribution curves, for which good agreement is
   found. The flow in serpentine disinfection tanks is dominated by a path
   of high streamwise velocities, a so-called short-circuiting path, which
   is almost constant in width regardless of the baffle spacing. In
   addition, large-scale turbulent vortices are shed from baffle edges and
   their size and dynamics depend on the spacing between subsequent
   baffles. The transport in serpentine-flow contact tanks is advection
   dominated and transport occurs mainly along the short-circuiting path.
   Wider compartments feature large recirculation zones with instantaneous
   vortices entraining solutes into these zones and thereby increasing
   residence times. Contact tanks with wide compartments suffer from severe
   short-circuiting and internal recirculation. This is directly reflected
   in hydraulic efficiency indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Stem cells for cardiac repair have shown promise in
   preclinical trials, but lower than expected retention, viability, and
   efficacy. Encapsulation is one potential strategy to increase viable
   cell retention while facilitating paracrine effects.
   Methods and Results-Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) were
   encapsulated in alginate and attached to the heart with a hydrogel patch
   in a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model. Cells were tracked using
   bioluminescence (BLI) and cardiac function measured by transthoracic
   echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).
   Microvasculature was quantified using von Willebrand factor staining and
   scar measured by Masson's Trichrome. Post-MI ejection fraction by CMR
   was greatly improved in encapsulated hMSC-treated animals (MI: 34 +/-
   3\%, MI+Gel: 35 +/- 3\%, MI+Gel+hMSC: 39 +/- 2\%, MI+Gel+encapsulated
   hMSC: 56 +/- 1\%; n=4 per group; P<0.01). Data represent mean +/- SEM.
   By TTE, encapsulated hMSC-treated animals had improved fractional
   shortening. Longitudinal BLI showed greatest hMSC retention when the
   cells were encapsulated (P<0.05). Scar size at 28 days was significantly
   reduced in encapsulated hMSC-treated animals (MI: 12 +/- 1\%, n=8;
   MI+Gel: 14 +/- 2\%, n=7; MI+Gel+hMSC: 14 +/- 1\%, n=7;
   MI+Gel+encapsulated hMSC: 7 +/- 1\%, n=6; P<0.05). There was a large
   increase in microvascular density in the peri-infarct area (MI: 121 +/-
   10, n=7; MI+Gel: 153 +/- 26, n=5; MI+Gel+hMSC: 198 +/- 18, n=7;
   MI+Gel+encapsulated hMSC: 828 +/- 56 vessels/mm(2), n=6; P<0.01).
   Conclusions-Alginate encapsulation improved retention of hMSCs and
   facilitated paracrine effects such as increased peri-infarct
   microvasculature and decreased scar. Encapsulation of MSCs improved
   cardiac function post-MI and represents a new, translatable strategy for
   optimization of regenerative therapies for cardiovascular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{All carbon electronics based on graphene have been an elusive goal. For
   more than a decade, the inability to produce significant band-gaps in
   this material has prevented the development of graphene electronics. We
   demonstrate a new approach to produce semiconducting graphene that uses
   a submonolayer concentration of nitrogen on SiC sufficient to pin
   epitaxial graphene to the SiC interface as it grows. The resulting
   buckled graphene opens a band gap greater than 0.7 eV in the otherwise
   continuous metallic graphene sheet.}},

   supported on TiO2 and isolated from each other by SiO2 to achieve both
   significantly improved sinter resistance up to 700 degrees C and
   outstanding activity after high-temperature calcination. This work not
   only demonstrates the feasibility of using a new triphasic system with

Abstract = {{Engineered nucleases, which incise the genome at predetermined sites,
   have a number of laboratory and clinical applications. There is,
   however, a need for better methods for controlled intracellular delivery
   of nucleases. Here, we demonstrate a method for ligand-mediated delivery
   of zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) proteins using transferrin
   receptor-mediated endocytosis. Uptake is rapid and efficient in
   established mammalian cell lines and in primary cells, including mouse
   and human hematopoietic stem-progenitor cell populations. In contrast to
   cDNA expression, ZFN protein levels decline rapidly following
   internalization, affording better temporal control of nuclease activity.
   We show that transferrin-mediated ZFN uptake leads to site-specific in
   situ cleavage of the target locus. Additionally, despite the much
   shorter duration of ZFN activity, the efficiency of gene correction
   approaches that seen with cDNA-mediated expression. The approach is
   flexible and general, with the potential for extension to other
   targeting ligands and nuclease architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cell differentiation recapitulates aspects of embryonic
   development, including the regulation of morphogenesis and cell
   specification via precise spatiotemporal signaling. The assembly and
   reorganization of cadherins within multicellular aggregates may
   similarly influence -catenin signaling dynamics and the associated
   cardiomyogenic differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells
   (ESCs). In this study, dynamic changes in -catenin expression and
   transcriptional activity were analyzed in response to altered cell
   adhesion kinetics during embryoid body (EB) formation and
   differentiation. Modulation of intercellular adhesion kinetics by rotary
   orbital mixing conditions led to temporal modulation of T-cell
   factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor activity, as well as changes in
   the spatial localization and phosphorylation state of -catenin
   expression. Slower rotary speeds, which promoted accelerated ESC
   aggregation, resulted in the early accumulation of nuclear
   dephosphorylated -catenin, which was followed by a decrease in -catenin
   transcriptional activity and an increase in the gene expression of Wnt
   inhibitors such as Dkk-1. In addition, EBs that exhibited increased
   -catenin transcriptional activity at early stages of differentiation
   subsequently demonstrated increased expression of genes related to
   cardiomyogenic phenotypes, and inhibition of the Wnt pathway during the
   initial 4 days of differentiation significantly decreased cardiomyogenic
   gene expression. Together, the results of this study indicate that the
   expression and transcriptional activity of -catenin are temporally
   regulated by multicellular aggregation kinetics of pluripotent ESCs and
   influence mesoderm and cardiomyocyte differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The biotransformation potential of a commercial naphthenic acid (NA)
   mixture (NA sodium salt; TCI Chemicals) under aerobic conditions was
   investigated using mixed aerobic cultures developed under various levels
   and duration of NA exposure. A culture enriched using the commercial NA
   mixture as the sole carbon source degraded NAs in a range of NA
   concentrations, regardless of culture age and the presence of a
   co-substrate; however, only 28.5\% of the NA-carbon was detected as CO2
   while 44\% was utilized for biomass growth. A fraction of the NA mixture
   (15-26\%) was persistent under all conditions studied. In contrast, a
   culture fed with a degradable synthetic wastewater only (NA un-amended
   culture) and another culture fed with the same wastewater and 50 mg NAIL
   (NA-amended culture), over time lost their ability to degrade NAs.
   Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene based clone library revealed that 80\% of
   the NA-enriched culture belonged to the gamma-Proteobacteria class and
   was largely dominated by phylotypes most closely related to known NA and
   hydrocarbon degraders such as Pseudomonas and Microbulbifer. The results
   of this study indicate that although significant NA degradation is
   possible, only a small fraction of the NA mixture is completely
   mineralized to CO2. Further investigation into the biotransformation
   products and conditions affecting NA biodegradation under realistic
   refinery and environmental conditions will help to design effective
   treatment and bioremediation processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cell-based therapies represent promising strategies for tissue repair,
   particularly in cases in which host cells, due to disease, age, or
   excessive trauma, are unable to repair the defect or deficiency alone,
   even with additional delivered therapeutics. Current cell therapies fail
   to address long-term engraftment or delivery timing and location and
   result in modest improvements with long term engraftment rates of less
   than 1\%. In many cell therapy applications, an appropriate carrier must
   be used to deliver transplanted cells and promote cell engraftment and
   function for a successful outcome by providing the appropriate
   microenvironment for the interactions between transplanted and host
   cells. This review highlights important considerations for engineering
   the microenvironment for cell delivery and engraftment in tissue repair.}},

Abstract = {{A new geometry-based channel model is proposed for wide-band polarized
   body-area-network channels consisting of four propagation modes, i.e.,
   cylindrical surface scattering (CSS) for above-ground off-body
   scattering (BS), BS for body diffracted and on-BS, ground scattering
   (GS), and line-of-sight. A conservation-of-polarization plane
   methodology is used for the CSS and GS propagation modes. For the BS
   propagation mode, a geometrical theory of diffraction is used and
   related to CSS. The channel cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and
   time-frequency correlation function (TF-CF) are derived from the model.
   Comparisons of the XPD and the TF-CF that are obtained from the model
   (with appropriate physical parameters) and those obtained from wide-band
   measurements at 13-GHz are in good agreement. We observed the GS
   propagation mode to be the dominant mode in our experiments. The azimuth
   angle of arrival (AAoA) of a ground reflected wave is shown in theory to
   have a significant effect on the XPD.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoscale lattice structures are a type of cellular structure with
   support element lengths on the order of magnitude of centimetres. These
   types of structures are engineered for high performance and are used
   particularly in industries where low weight and high strength are
   desired. However, designing these structures can be difficult because
   they can contain thousands of individual elements. To design mesoscale
   lattice structures, current synthesis methods generally require some
   form of rigorous, multi-variable optimisation that can slow or halt the
   design process. In this article, we present an alternative method for
   the design of mesoscale lattice structures: the size matching and
   scaling method. This method eliminates the need for time-consuming
   optimisation by using a combination of a solid-body finite element
   analysis and a library of pre-defined lattice configurations to generate
   a structure's lattice topology. In addition, we explore several methods
   for determining the best lattice diameter values for the lattice
   topology. Various 2D and 3D examples will be used to test and validate
   the method.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) represent widely used cationic
   biocides that persist in natural environments. Although microbial
   degradation, sensitivity and resistance to QACs have been extensively
   documented, a quantitative understanding of how whole communities adapt
   to QAC exposure remain elusive. To gain insights into these issues, we
   exposed a microbial community from a contaminated river sediment to
   varied levels of benzalkonium chlorides (BACs, a family of QACs) for 3
   years. Comparative metagenomic analysis showed that the BAC-fed
   communities were dramatically decreased in phylogenetic diversity
   compared with the control (no BAC exposure), resulting presumably from
   BAC toxicity, and dominated by Pseudomonas species (>50\% of the total).
   Time-course metagenomics revealed that community adaptation occurred
   primarily via selective enrichment of BAC-degrading Pseudomonas
   populations, particularly P.nitroreducens, and secondarily via amino
   acid substitutions and horizontal transfer of a few selected genes in
   the Pseudomonas populations, including a gene encoding a PAS/PAC sensor
   protein and ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes. P.nitroreducens
   isolates were reproducibly recoverable from communities after prolonged
   periods of no-BAC exposure, suggesting that they are robust
   BAC-degraders. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms and
   tempo of microbial community adaptation to QAC exposure and has
   implications for treating QACs in biological engineered systems.}},

Abstract = {{A power-efficient wireless capacitor charging system for inductively

   directly charged from an ac source by generating a current through a
   series charge injection capacitor and a capacitor charger circuit. The
   fixed charging current reduces energy loss in switches, while maximizing
   the charging efficiency. An adaptive capacitor tuner compensates for the
   resonant capacitance variations during charging to keep the amplitude of
   the ac input voltage at its peak. We have fabricated the capacitor
   charging system prototype in a 0.35-mu m 4-metal 2-poly standard CMOS
   process in 2.1 mm(2) of chip area. It can charge four pairs of
   capacitors sequentially. While receiving 2.7-V peak ac input through a
   2-MHz inductive link, the capacitor charging system can charge each pair
   of 1 mu F capacitors up to +/- 2 V in 420 mu s, achieving a high
   measured charging efficiency of 82\%.}},

Abstract = {{Methylmercury (MeHg), a neurotoxic substance that accumulates in aquatic
   food chains and poses a risk to human health, is synthesized by
   anaerobic microorganisms in the environment. To date, mercury (Hg)
   methylation has been attributed to sulfate- and iron-reducing bacteria
   (SRB and IRB, respectively). Here we report that a methanogen,
   Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1, methylated Hg in a sulfide-free medium
   at comparable rates, but with higher yields, than those observed for
   some SRB and IRB. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the concatenated
   orthologs of the Hg methylation proteins HgcA and HgcB from M. hungatei
   are closely related to those from known SRB and IRB methylators and that
   they cluster together with proteins from eight other methanogens,
   suggesting that these methanogens may also methylate Hg. Because all
   nine methanogens with HgcA and HgcB orthologs belong to the class
   Methanomicrobia, constituting the late-evolving methanogenic lineage,
   methanogenic Hg methylation could not be considered an ancient metabolic
   trait. Our results identify methanogens as a new guild of Hg-methylating
   microbes with a potentially important role in mineral-poor (sulfate-and
   iron-limited) anoxic freshwater environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we integrated terminal truncation and N-terminal
   oligopeptide fusion as a novel protein engineering strategy to improve
   specific activity and catalytic efficiency of alkaline alpha-amylase
   (AmyK) from Alkalimonas amylolytica. First, the C terminus or N terminus
   of AmyK was partially truncated, yielding 12 truncated mutants, and then
   an oligopeptide (AEAEAKAKAEAE AKAK) was fused at the N terminus of the
   truncated AmyK, yielding another 12 truncation-fusion mutants. The
   specific activities of the truncation-fusion mutants AmyK Delta
   C500-587::OP and AmyK Delta C492-587::OP were 25.5- and 18.5-fold that
   of AmyK, respectively. The k(cat)/K-m was increased from 1.0 x 10(5)
   liters.mol(-1).s(-1) for AmyK to 30.6 x and 23.2 x 10(5)
   liters.mol(-1).s(-1) for AmyK Delta C500-587::OP and AmyK Delta
   C492-587::OP, respectively. Comparative analysis of structure models
   indicated that the higher flexibility around the active site may be the
   main reason for the improved catalytic efficiency. The proposed terminal
   truncation and oligopeptide fusion strategy may be effective to engineer
   other enzymes to improve specific activity and catalytic efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A membrane-less microbial fuel cell (ML-MFC) was developed to
   investigate the simultaneous carbon removal and denitrification. The
   removal rates of 0.64 kg COD m(-3) of liquid cathode volume (LCV) d(-1)
   and 0.186 g NO3--N m(-3) of LCV d(-1) were achieved, which resulted in
   the maximal COD and nitrate removal rates of 100\% and 36.7\%,
   respectively. The ML-MFC also achieved a maximal power output of 0.0712
   W m(-3) of LCV and 0.844 A m(-3) of LCV in approximately 24 h. The
   maximal coulombic efficiency of anode (CEAn) and cathode (CECa) was
   5.1\% and 475\%, respectively. The anodic gas phase was consisted of
   77.2 +/- 4.0\% CH4, 3.9 +/- 0.5\% CO2, and 3.9 +/- 1.5\% N-2, which
   indicated that the low anode coulombic efficiency was due to anodic
   methane production. The results of this study demonstrated the potential
   application of ML-MFC in simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal and
   energy (electricity) production. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A wafer-level batch fabricated mechanically flexible interconnect (MFI)
   technology with 65-mu m vertical elastic range of motion is

   strength and enhanced geometrical design is adopted to enable elastic
   deformation over the entire vertical range of motion. The enhanced
   geometrical design of the MFIs ensures that the stress is distributed
   uniformly during deformation, and simultaneously maintains an inner
   stress that is lower than the yield strength of NiW during vertical
   deformation. In addition, the MFIs are passivated with gold, which is
   experimentally verified to not only lower the electrical resistance, but
   also significantly extends the lifetime of the MFIs as it eliminates
   oxidation of NiW. For 10-mu m-thick Au-NiW MFIs, the contact force is up
   to 10 mN at 50-mu m elastic vertical deformation (i.e., compliance of 5
   mm/N).}},

Abstract = {{Using successive stages, or nesting compliant amplification mechanisms,
   soft actuators with performance suitable for robotic applications can be
   constructed with piezoelectric ceramic as the active material. This
   paper presents a mathematical framework that describes the interactions
   among the various amplification mechanisms in a hierarchical nested
   structure. A formal treatment of nested amplification mechanisms results
   in two theorems that describe the stiffness properties of the whole
   actuator in terms of the properties of each mechanism in the hierarchy.
   These theorems show that the stiffness properties of the actuator can be
   computed by considering only the outermost few layers in the nested
   configuration. By virtue of this hierarchical structure, the actuator
   also assumes a cellular structure; it functions by summing the effects
   of on-off inputs coupled by a flexible connective medium. This requires
   a paradigm shift when selecting control strategies. A multilayer strain
   amplification mechanism is designed to meet the required range of travel
   for a biologically inspired camera positioning mechanism, and a
   switching control method for the actuator's 16 on-off inputs is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Flat glass is approximately a \$20 billion/year industry worldwide, with
   almost all flat glass products being manufactured on float glass lines.
   New technologies are allowing float glass manufacturers to increase the
   level of automation in their plants, but the question of how to
   effectively use the automation has given rise to a new and difficult
   class of optimization problems. These optimization problems combine
   aspects of traditional cutting problems and traditional scheduling and
   sequencing problems. In this paper we consider a float line with a fully
   automated offloading process using robots to pick up glass plates from
   the float line. The continuous nature of the process causes some glass
   to be wasted if it is cut but cannot be picked up in time. Such wasted
   glass is called cycle time scrap. Even if any glass cut could easily be
   offloaded, the laying out of the customers' orders on to the ribbon can
   incur waste known as layout scrap. We define and model a problem of
   optimizing the cutting sequence and the layout of the glass being cut so
   that the total amount lost to cycle time scrap and layout scrap is
   small. We develop heuristic solution methods using construction and
   local search algorithms for this problem. We validate the proposed
   approach using real data from a major float glass manufacturer and show
   that it produces manufacturing yields greater than 99\%. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{To investigate the wall heat transfer characteristics in a combustion
   chamber over a broad range of pressure conditions, a method of taking a
   series of wall temperature measurements in a heat sink combustion
   chamber, and calculating the wall temperature and heat flux from the
   temperature data, was introduced. The temperature and heat flux at the
   inner wall of the combustion chamber can be obtained using this method.
   The key parameters of the test article are presented, and the technique
   requirements for thermocouples are described. A two-dimensional (2D)
   axisymmetric numerical calculation method was developed to obtain the
   wall temperature and heat flux from the measured temperatures. The
   method was applied to a firing test of a single-element gaseous
   hydrogen/gaseous oxygen shear-coaxial injector chamber to demonstrate
   the details of the method. Furthermore, the heat transfer
   characteristics of a single-element combustion chamber at chamber
   pressures of 0.92 MPa to 6.1 MPa were investigated using this method.
   The results indicate that the wall heat flux of this gas-gas injector
   combustor has, qualitatively, the same distribution at different
   pressures and correlates quantitatively with the chamber pressure as
   pc0.8.}},

Title = {{Financial Valuation of Investments in International Construction
   Markets: Real-Options Approach for Market-Entry Decisions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{355-368}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The body of knowledge in decision making about international
   construction market entry has been primarily focused on identifying risk
   factors, quantifying risks, and developing risk management strategies
   for construction firms to be more likely to succeed in international
   markets (e.g.,risk registrars, industry checklists, entry procedures,
   and quantitative/qualitative risk assessment models). Going
   international can also be considered as a large-scale investment for a
   firm because it has all three major characteristics of an investment
   decision: (1)entering an international market requires a substantial
   level of initial outlays; (2)this initial capital is not completely
   recoverable if the firm decides to exit the market; and (3)the success
   of an international construction business venture is subject to great
   market uncertainty, which is exogenous to the firm. Traditionally,
   financial valuation of international construction markets is conducted
   by net present value (NPV) analysis approach. Although simple, NPV
   analysis is subject to two major limitations: (1)it does not
   systematically capture and treat volatility of revenue streams in
   characterizing the firm's financial risk profile; and (2)it does not
   explicitly address the firm's flexibility in market entry or exit time
   and its impact on the firm's investment value. This paper presents a
   financial valuation model based on the real-options methodology to
   overcome these limitations. The real-options theory from
   finance/decision science is applied to evaluate investments in
   international construction markets and determine the firm's optimal time
   to enter or exit a market. The real-options model presented in this
   paper is used to price two kinds of options typically embedded in the
   international construction market context: deferring investment and
   exiting the market. This model can be useful to international
   contractors because without a proper options pricing model, the
   significant impact of these flexible options may be overlooked; hence,
   the value of an investment opportunity may be erroneously computed. (C)

   z-axis rotation. Aluminum nitride thin films have been used to provide
   highly efficient electromechanical transduction for drive and sense
   modes without requiring any dc polarization voltage for operation. A

Abstract = {{Drug delivery through micromachined needles is an attractive alternative
   to intramuscular and subdermal injection by hypodermic needles, due to
   the potential for reduced pain caused by the micro-sized needles. In
   this paper, a polymer-based fabrication process using UV lithography
   into micromolds is developed, allowing the fabrication of microneedle
   (MN) shafts, tips, lumens, and substrate baseplate using lithography.
   Using UV lithography into micromolds allows complex three-dimensional
   structures to be defined, since both mask patterns and mold topography
   are available to define the structures. A hollow MN array and baseplate,
   in which the needle lumens extend through the thickness of the
   baseplate, are demonstrated. Fabricated SU-8 MNs are 825 mu m in height
   and 400 mu m in width, with a pyramidal tip; the needle lumen, 120 mu m
   in diameter, intersects with one of the faces of the pyramidal tip.
   Mechanical characterization of the fabricated MNs shows that the
   fracture force of a single needle against a rigid surface is 12.0 N. The
   insertion force of a single needle into porcine skin is empirically
   determined to be 2.4 N. The fracture force of the needle against porcine
   skin is observed to be in excess of 90 N. {[}2012-0359]}},

Title = {{Power spectrum analysis of the x-ray scatter signal in mammography and
   breast tomosynthesis projections}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To analyze the frequency domain characteristics of the signal
   in mammography images and breast tomosynthesis projections with patient
   tissue texture due to detected scattered x-rays.
   Methods: Acquisitions of x-ray projection images of 19 different patient
   breasts were simulated using previously acquired volumetric patient
   images. Acquisition of these images was performed with a dedicated
   breast CT prototype system, and the images were classified into voxels
   representing skin, adipose, and glandular tissue with a previously
   validated automated algorithm. The classified three dimensional images
   then underwent simulated mechanical compression representing that which
   is performed during acquisition of mammography and breast tomosynthesis
   images. The acquisition of projection images of each patient breast was
   simulated using Monte Carlo methods with each simulation resulting in
   two images: one of the primary (non-scattered) signal and one of the
   scatter signal. To analyze the scatter signal for both mammography and
   breast tomosynthesis, two projections images of each patient breast were
   simulated, one with the x-ray source positioned at 0 degrees
   (mammography and central tomosynthesis projection) and at 30 degrees
   (wide tomosynthesis projection). The noise power spectra (NPS) for both
   the scatter signal alone and the total signal (primary + scatter) for
   all images were obtained and the combined results of all patients
   analyzed. The total NPS was fit to the expected power-law relationship
   NPS(f) = k/f boolean AND beta and the results were compared with those
   previously published on the power spectrum characteristics of
   mammographic texture. The scatter signal alone was analyzed
   qualitatively and a power-law fit was also performed.
   Results: The mammography and tomosynthesis projections of three patient
   breasts were too small to analyze, so a total of 16 patient breasts were
   analyzed. The values of beta for the total signal of the 0 degrees
   projections agreed well with previously published results. As expected,
   the scatter power spectrum reflected a fast drop-off with increasing
   spatial frequency, with a reduction of four orders of magnitude by 0.1
   lp/mm. The beta values for the scatter signal were 6.14 and 6.39 for the
   0 degrees and 30 degrees projections, respectively.
   Conclusions: Although the low-frequency characteristics of scatter in
   mammography and breast tomosynthesis were known, a quantitative analysis
   of the frequency domain characteristics of this signal was needed in
   order to optimize previously proposed software-based x-ray scatter
   reduction algorithms for these imaging modalities. (c) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Silicon is a high-capacity anode material for lithium-ion batteries.
   Electrochemical cycling of Si electrodes usually produces amorphous
   LixSi (a-LixSi) alloys at room temperature. Despite intensive
   investigation of the electrochemical behaviors of a-LixSi alloys, their
   mechanical properties and underlying atomistic mechanisms remain largely
   unexplored. Here we perform molecular dynamics simulations to
   characterize the mechanical properties of a-LixSi with a newly developed
   reactive force field (ReaxFF). We compute the yield and fracture
   strengths of a-LixSi alloys under a variety of chemomechanical loading
   conditions, including the constrained thin-film lithiation, biaxial
   compression, uniaxial tension and compression. Effects of loading
   sequence and stress state are investigated to correlate the mechanical
   responses with the dominant atomic bonding, featuring a transition from
   the covalent to the metallic glass characteristics with increasing Li
   concentration. The results provide mechanistic insights for interpreting
   experiments, understanding properties and designing new experiments on
   a-LixSi alloys, which are essential to the development of durable Si
   electrodes for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{GaN ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) have attracted tremendous
   attention due to their chemical stability in harsh environments.
   Although Schottky-contacted GaN-based UV PDs have been implemented with
   better performance than that of ohmic contacts, it remains unknown how
   the barrier height at local Schottky contacts controls the sensors'
   performance. In this work, the piezotronic effect was employed to tune
   the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at local contacts and hence enhance
   the performances of Schottky-contacted metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)
   structured GaN nanobelt (NB)-based PDs. In general, the response level
   of the PDs was obviously enhanced by the piezotronic effect when
   applying a strain on devices. The responsivity of the PD was increased
   by 18\%, and the sensitivity was enhanced by from 22\% to 31\%, when
   illuminated by a 325 nm laser with light intensity ranging from 12 to 2
   W/cm(2). Carefully studying the mechanism using band structure diagrams
   reveals that the observed enhancement of the PD performance resulted
   from the change in SBH caused by external strain as well as light
   intensity. Using piezotronic effects thus provides a practical way to
   enhance the performance of PDs made not only of GaN, but also other
   wurtzite and zinc blende family materials.}},

Abstract = {{50/50 NR/NBR blends with various MWCNT loadings were prepared by mixing
   with MWCNT/NR masterbatches on a two-roll mill and sheeted off at the
   smallest nip gap. Then, the effect of milling direction, machine
   direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD), on the mechanical and
   electrical properties of the blends was elucidated. Dichroic ratio and
   SEM results confirmed that most of the MWCNTs were aligned along MD when
   MWCNT was less than 4 phr, and the number of agglomerates increased when
   MWCNT was more than 4 phr. Additionally, anisotropic properties were
   clearly observed when 4 phr MWCNT was loaded. At 4 phr MWCNT, 100\%
   modulus and tensile strength in the MD were about 1.5 and 1.3 times
   higher than those in the TD, respectively. Moreover, electrical
   conductivity in the MD was superior to that in the TD by about 3 orders
   of magnitude. Results from dynamic mechanical tests also showed that the
   maximum tan delta in the MD sample was lower than that in the
   corresponding TD sample. In addition, the storage modulus at 30 degrees
   C for the MD sample containing 4 phr MWCNT was 1.15 higher than that of
   the corresponding TD sample. This stronger reinforcement efficiency
   resulted from the combination of the greater alignment and dispersion of
   most MWCNTs in the MD sample. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective Elevated levels of oxidative stress have been reported in
   abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), but which reactive oxygen species
   promotes the development of AAA remains unclear. Here, we investigate
   the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-degrading enzyme catalase on the
   formation of AAA.
   Approach and Results AAA were induced with the application of calcium
   chloride (CaCl2) on mouse infrarenal aortas. The administration of
   PEG-catalase, but not saline, attenuated the loss of tunica media and
   protected against AAA formation (0.910.1 versus 0.76 +/- 0.09 mm).
   Similarly, in a transgenic mouse model, catalase overexpression in the
   vascular smooth muscle cells preserved the thickness of tunica media and
   inhibited aortic dilatation by 50\% (0.85 +/- 0.14 versus 0.57 +/- 0.08
   mm). Further studies showed that injury with CaCl2 decreased catalase
   expression and activity in the aortic wall. Pharmacological
   administration or genetic overexpression of catalase restored catalase
   activity and subsequently decreased matrix metalloproteinase activity.
   In addition, a profound reduction in inflammatory markers and vascular
   smooth muscle cell apoptosis was evident in aortas of
   catalase-overexpressing mice. Interestingly, as opposed to infusion of
   PEG-catalase, chronic overexpression of catalase in vascular smooth
   muscle cells did not alter the total aortic H2O2 levels.
   Conclusions The data suggest that a reduction in aortic wall catalase
   activity can predispose to AAA formation. Restoration of catalase
   activity in the vascular wall enhances aortic vascular smooth muscle
   cell survival and prevents AAA formation primarily through modulation of
   matrix metalloproteinase activity.}},

Abstract = {{Human amnion/chorion tissue derived from the placenta is rich in
   cytokines and growth factors known to promote wound healing; however,
   preservation of the biological activities of therapeutic allografts
   during processing remains a challenge. In this study, PURION (R)
   (MiMedx, Marietta, GA) processed dehydrated human amnion/chorion tissue
   allografts (dHACM, EpiFix (R), MiMedx) were evaluated for the presence
   of growth factors, interleukins (ILs) and tissue inhibitors of
   metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
   were performed on samples of dHACM and showed quantifiable levels of the
   following growth factors: platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA),
   PDGF-BB, transforming growth factor (TGF), TGF1, basic fibroblast growth
   factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), placental growth factor
   (PLGF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). The ELISA
   assays also confirmed the presence of IL-4, 6, 8 and 10, and TIMP 1, 2
   and 4. Moreover, the relative elution of growth factors into saline from
   the allograft ranged from 4\% to 62\%, indicating that there are bound
   and unbound fractions of these compounds within the allograft. dHACM
   retained biological activities that cause human dermal fibroblast
   proliferation and migration of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in
   vitro. An in vivo mouse model showed that dHACM when tested in a skin
   flap model caused mesenchymal progenitor cell recruitment to the site of
   implantation. The results from both the in vitro and in vivo experiments
   clearly established that dHACM contains one or more soluble factors
   capable of stimulating MSC migration and recruitment. In summary, PURION
   (R) processed dHACM retains its biological activities related to wound
   healing, including the potential to positively affect four distinct and
   pivotal physiological processes intimately involved in wound healing:
   cell proliferation, inflammation, metalloproteinase activity and
   recruitment of progenitor cells. This suggests a paracrine mechanism of
   action for dHACM when used for wound healing applications.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
   tropical storm (TS) activity over the western North Pacific Ocean is
   examined for the period from 1981 to 2010. In El Nino years, TS genesis
   locations are generally shifted to the southeast relative to normal
   years and the passages of TSs tend to recurve to the northeast. TSs of
   greater duration and more intensity during an El Nino summer induce an
   increase of the accumulated tropical cyclone kinetic energy (ACE). Based
   on the strong relationship between the TS properties and ENSO, a
   probabilistic prediction for seasonal ACE is investigated using a hybrid
   dynamical-statistical model. A statistical relationship is developed
   between the observed ACE and large-scale variables taken from the ECMWF
   seasonal forecast system 4 hindcasts. The ACE correlates positively with
   the SST anomaly over the central to eastern Pacific and negatively with
   the vertical wind shear near the date line. The vertical wind shear
   anomalies over the central and western Pacific are selected as
   predictors based on sensitivity tests of ACE predictive skill. The
   hybrid model performs quite well in forecasting seasonal ACE with a
   correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted ACE at 0.80
   over the 30-yr period. A relative operating characteristic analysis also
   indicates that the ensembles have significant probabilistic skill for
   both the above-normal and below-normal categories. By comparing the ACE
   prediction over the period from 2003 to 2011, the hybrid model appears
   more skillful than the forecast from the Tropical Storm Risk consortium.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In most of the numerical approaches proposed for modeling high-intensity
   plasma-arcs, the effects of turbulence on the arc structure are often
   excluded because of the intricate physics originating from the
   interaction of turbulent scales, high-temperature gas dynamics,
   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and chemical kinetics. The goal of this study
   is threefold: to develop a generic turbulent MHD model to simulate
   free-burning arc discharges, to validate the code with available
   experimental data, and to investigate the effect of an external field
   and turbulent cross flow on the free-burning arc configuration. The
   governing equations are solved in conservative form using a hybrid
   scheme that combines a high-order monotonic upwind scheme with a
   second-order central scheme. The fluid and MHD turbulence are resolved
   using a large eddy simulation (LES) approach with a recently developed
   sub-grid closure model. An implicit scheme is used to compute the
   magnetic diffusion term appearing in the magnetic induction equation to
   alleviate the severe time-step constraint. The comparison of the model
   prediction with experimental data for Argon arcs at different current
   intensities shows generally good agreement. When an external field is
   applied, the overall shape of the free-burning arc drastically changes.
   The straightening of the arc indicates the potential for stabilization
   of a free-burning arc by magnetic forces. Even though the turbulence is
   significantly attenuated as a result of the thermal expansion near the
   cathode, it adds an unsteady characteristic to the arc and, in general,
   has a negative impact on the stabilization of the electrical discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Helicon plasma sources are capable of efficiently ionizing propellants
   and have been considered for application in electric propulsion.
   However, studies that estimate the ion production cost of the helicon
   plasma source are limited and rely on estimates of the extracted ion
   current. The ion production cost of a helicon plasma source is
   determined using a gridded ion thruster configuration that allows
   accurate measurement of the ion beam current. These measurements are
   used in conjunction with previous characterization of the helicon plasma
   to create a model of the discharge plasma within the gridded thruster.
   The device is tested across a range of operating conditions: 343-600W
   radio frequency power at 13.56 MHz, 50-250G and 1.5 mg s(-1) of argon at
   a pressure of 1.6 x 10(-5) Torr-Ar. The ion production cost is 132-212

Abstract = {{Detecting increases of incidence rate of an adverse health event is
   critical to health surveillance. Motivated by successful applications in
   industry quality control and productivity improvement, various
   cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedures have been developed to monitor rate
   changes of health events when population size changes over time. Average
   run length, which is commonly used in quality control, may be
   inappropriate in some situations when comparing control chart
   performance in health surveillance applications. This paper provides a
   thorough statistical comparison of CUSUM-type procedures in the health
   care context based on different evaluation metrics. We show that
   different measures may favor different surveillance methods depending on
   the corresponding design criteria. We thus recommend a probabilistic
   measure as the criterion for design and evaluation of CUSUM control
   charts in health care surveillance. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Dynamic properties of fine-grained soils engineered with a controlled
   organic phase}},
Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{176-186}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Soils with high organic content are frequently encountered beneath
   earthquake sensitive infrastructure, such as bridges or levees.
   Historically, the dynamic properties of these organically rich soils
   have been difficult to predict due to the heterogeneity of the natural
   organic matter that is found in natural soils, even though their
   response to dynamic loading remains critical to assessing the ongoing
   stability of the infrastructure. In this study, an experimental
   investigation was performed on a montmorillonite soil that was modified
   with a controlled organic phase. Quaternary ammonium cations were
   exchanged onto the soil particle surfaces through cation exchange with
   the clay's naturally occurring cations (e.g., Na+, Ca2+). Quaternary
   ammonium cations with a variable structure were chosen, which allowed
   control on the cation's size and length of alkyl chain, as well as a
   control on the density of organic loading on the clay surface. The
   dynamic properties of organoclays were then quantified experimentally
   using resonant column and bender element tests. This study demonstrated
   that the increase in the total organic carbon content of the soil
   increased the shear wave velocity and stiffness of the soil (G(max)) due
   to a reduction in the void ratio of the organically rich soil. Cation
   structure did have a measureable impact on the soil stiffness, with
   organic cations with carbon concentrated primarily in a single tail
   demonstrating higher stiffness than those soils engineered with a
   branched cation structure. When compared to inorganic soils, the
   presence of the organic cations in the soil increased the range of
   linear elastic behavior of that soil, with the organoclays having a
   threshold strain of 0.024\% or higher. The soil samples with the largest
   percentage of total organic carbon and the lowest void ratio
   demonstrated the largest damping ratio (ratio between dissipated and
   stored energy) during cyclic loading at small strain. Regression
   analysis of the dynamic test results demonstrated that the total organic
   content and the void ratio were the most dominant factors in determining
   G(max) for the high organic content clays. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The grid method is a full-field optical technique for computing surface

   Here, the grid method is extended to three dimensions by using a crossed
   grid pattern and a diffraction grating which enables acquiring images
   from multiple viewing angles on a single camera. In-plane displacements
   and strains are computed using the conventional grid method, and the
   corresponding three-dimensional (3D) displacementsincluding out-of-plane
   displacements or shapesare computed by analyzing the images collected at
   different viewing angles. The technique is demonstrated by measuring 3D
   rigid body motion, the 3D displacements of a membrane in a

Abstract = {{In this paper, first, we propose Star-NC, a new network coding (NC)
   scheme for multiple unicast sessions in an n-input n-output star
   structure. Then, we evaluate the network throughput of this coding
   scheme in wireless mesh network over the traditional non-NC
   transmission. Our scheme benefits from the proximity of all the nodes
   around the relay node and employs a more general form of overhearing
   different from other schemes such as COPE. We found that the gain of our
   NC scheme depends on both the star size and the routing pattern of the
   unicast transmissions. Based on this, we identify both the situations
   which the maximum gain is achievable and a lower bound for the expected
   value of the gain in the case of random routing pattern. Next, we
   propose an analytical framework for studying throughput gain of our
   Star-NC scheme in general wireless network topologies. Our theoretical
   formulation via linear programming provides a method for finding
   source-destination routes and utilizing the best choices of our NC
   scheme to maximize the throughput. Finally, we evaluate our model for
   various networks, traffic models and routing strategies over
   coding-oblivious routing. We also compare the throughput gain of our
   scheme with COPE-type NC scheme. We show that Star-NC exploits new
   coding opportunities different from COPE-type NC and thus can be used
   with or without this scheme. The results show that Star-NC has often
   better performance than COPE for a directional traffic model which is a
   typical model in wireless mesh networks. Moreover, we found that, joint
   Star and COPE-type NC has better throughput performance than each of
   Star or COPE alone.}},

Abstract = {{We prove several results about the rate of convergence to stationarity,
   that is, the spectral gap, for the M/M/n queue in the Halfin-Whitt
   regime. We identify the limiting rate of convergence to steady-state,
   and discover an asymptotic phase transition that occurs w.r.t. this
   rate. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a constant B{*}
   approximate to 1.85772 s.t. when a certain excess parameter B is an
   element of (0, B{*}], the error in the steady-state approximation
   converges exponentially fast to zero at rate B-2/4. or B > B{*}, the
   error in the steady-state approximation converges exponentially fast to
   zero at a different rate, which is the solution to an explicit equation
   given in terms of special functions. This result may be interpreted as
   an asymptotic version of a phase transition proven to occur for any
   fixed n by van Doom {[}Stochastic Monotonicity and Queueing Applications

   We also prove explicit bounds on the distance to stationarity for the

   that such approximations can be inaccurate when m is too close to n,

   criterion on m that describes the needed amount of regularization to
   ensure that the least squares method is stable and that its accuracy,
   measured in L (2)(X,rho (X) ), is comparable to the best approximation
   error of f by elements from V (m) . We illustrate this criterion for
   various approximation schemes, such as trigonometric polynomials, with
   rho (X) being the uniform measure, and algebraic polynomials, with rho
   (X) being either the uniform or Chebyshev measure. For such examples we

Abstract = {{Prognosis and diagnosis of cardiac diseases frequently require
   quantitative evaluation of the ventricle volume, mass, and ejection
   fraction. The delineation of themyocardial wall is involved in all of
   these evaluations, which is a challenging task due to large variations
   in myocardial shapes and image quality. In this paper, we present an
   automatic method for extracting the myocardial wall of the left and
   right ventricles from cardiac CT images. In the method, the left and
   right ventricles are located sequentially, in which each ventricle is
   detected by first identifying the endocardium and then segmenting the
   epicardium. To this end, the endocardium is localized by utilizing its
   geometric features obtained on-line from a CT image. After that, a
   variational region-growing model is employed to extract the epicardium
   of the ventricles. In particular, the location of the endocardium of the
   left ventricle is determined via using an active contour model on the
   blood-pool surface. To localize the right ventricle, the active contour
   model is applied on a heart surface extracted based on the left

Abstract = {{A real-time and accurate object detection framework, C-4, is proposed in
   this paper. C-4 achieves 20 fps speed and the state-of-the-art detection
   accuracy, using only one processing thread without resorting to special
   hardware such as GPU. The real-time accurate object detection is made
   possible by two contributions. First, we conjecture (with supporting
   experiments) that contour is what we should capture and signs of
   comparisons among neighboring pixels are the key information to capture
   contour cues. Second, we show that the CENTRIST visual descriptor is
   suitable for contour based object detection, because it encodes the sign
   information and can implicitly represent the global contour. When
   CENTRIST and linear classifier are used, we propose a computational
   method that does not need to explicitly generate feature vectors. It
   involves no image preprocessing or feature vector normalization, and
   only requires O(1) steps to test an image patch. C-4 is also friendly to
   further hardware acceleration. It has been applied to detect objects
   such as pedestrians, faces, and cars on benchmark data sets. It has
   comparable detection accuracy with state-of-the-art methods, and has a
   clear advantage in detection speed.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged as a powerful framework
   for acquiring sparse signals. The bulk of the CS literature has focused
   on the case where the acquired signal has a sparse or compressible
   representation in an orthonormal basis. In practice, however, there are
   many signals that cannot be sparsely represented or approximated using
   an orthonormal basis, but that do have sparse representations in a
   redundant dictionary. Standard results in CS can sometimes be extended
   to handle this case provided that the dictionary is sufficiently
   incoherent or well conditioned, but these approaches fail to address the
   case of a truly redundant or overcomplete dictionary. In this paper, we
   describe a variant of the iterative recovery algorithm CoSaMP for this
   more challenging setting. We utilize the D-RIP, a condition on the
   sensing matrix analogous to the well-known restricted isometry property.
   In contrast to prior work, the method and analysis are
   ``signal-focused{''}; that is, they are oriented around recovering the
   signal rather than its dictionary coefficients. Under the assumption
   that we have a near-optimal scheme for projecting vectors in signal
   space onto the model family of candidate sparse signals, we provide
   provable recovery guarantees. Developing a practical algorithm that can
   provably compute the required near-optimal projections remains a
   significant open problem, but we include simulation results using
   various heuristics that empirically exhibit superior performance to
   traditional recovery algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-induced Molecular Communication (FMC), where molecular transport is
   performed via flow, is utilized in microfluidic channels to enhance
   diffusion-based molecular communication. The incorporation of the
   microfluidic channel and the transport of molecules by flow, i.e.,
   convection, require a rigorous analysis to develop an end-to-end
   concentration propagation model and a design for microfluidic channels.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze
   concentration propagation in microfluidic channels from FMC perspective
   and devise them specifically to enhance the FMC. In this paper, a
   system-theoretic analysis of molecular transport is presented first. The
   system-theoretic model incorporates the solution of flow velocity in
   microfluidic channels and yields an end-to-end transfer function for
   concentration propagation based on building blocks of microfluidic
   channels. Then, the design of microfluidic channels is performed based
   on the least-squares Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering to achieve
   the desired end-to-end transfer function in FMC. According to the
   desired pass and stop bands, the required length and aspect-ratio
   parameters of the microfluidic channels are obtained for FIR filtering.
   The transfer functions for FMC is elaborated via numerical results.
   Furthermore, two example designs of microfluidic channels are presented
   for least-squares FIR band-pass and band-stop filtering in FMC.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Congenital heart valve disease is one of the most common
   abnormalities in children. There are limited technological solutions
   available for treating children with congenital heart valve diseases.
   The aim of this study is to provide the details of the consensus reached
   in terms of pediatric definitions, design approach, in vitro testing,
   and clinical trials, which may be used as guidance for developing
   prosthetic heart valves for the pediatric indication.
   Methods: In stark contrast to the various designs of adult-sized
   replacement valves available in the market, there are no Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA)-approved prosthetic heart valves available for use
   in the pediatric population. There is a pressing need for FDA-approved
   pediatric valve devices in the United States. The pediatric patient
   population has been typically excluded from replacement heart valve
   trials for several reasons. In January 2010, heart valve manufacturers
   and pediatric clinicians collaborated with academicians and FDA staff in
   a workshop to suggest ways to successfully evaluate pediatric prosthetic
   valves and conduct pediatric clinical trials to provide acceptable heart
   valve replacement options for this patient population.
   Results: Recommendations, derived from ISO 5840:2005 and the 2010 FDA
   Draft Replacement Heart Valve Guidance, are provided for hydrodynamic,
   durability, and fatigue testing.
   Conclusions: The article specifically addresses in vitro and premarket
   and postmarket approval clinical studies that should be considered by a
   heart valve manufacturer for obtaining regulatory approval of pediatric
   sizes of prosthetic heart valve designs that are already approved for
   adult clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{The capability to predict elastohydrodynamic film-thickness and friction
   from primary measurements of transport properties of liquid has been an
   elusive goal for tribologists for 50 years. Most comparisons between
   predictions and experiments involve some amount of tuning of the model
   in order to match the experimental results. In true prediction, this
   cannot be done since there are normally no experimental results to
   compare to. Primary measurements of lubricant transport properties of
   Squalane were performed, and used in a numerical friction prediction
   model. Afterwards, friction was measured in a ball-on-disc tribotester.
   No tuning of the lubricant properties, model or test setup were applied.
   The current work on EHL-friction is therefore a true representation of
   the current level of EHL-friction prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to decrease the number of inputs needed to
   control a system comprised of a large set of subsystems. The method
   couples the inputs of the subsystems using a row-column structure, thus
   reducing the number of inputs from inn to m + n. The resulting
   underactuated system is shown to maintain complete controllability if
   the subsystems are decoupled. Feedback for the entire system is
   performed by reducing the dimension of the subspace of the control
   inputs from a high dimension to one dimension using singular value
   decomposition. A stability condition for this feedback loop is presented
   based on the small gain theorem. In addition, the effect of the
   dimension reduction is explained using a simulation example. (C) 2013

   and its biological functions followed by outlining current efforts to
   engineer ECMs with both natural and synthetic polymers. We then focus on
   colloidal particles as potential artificial ECM components that could
   increase the complexity as modular building blocks. Drawing from
   examples from the literature we present the broad utility of colloids

Abstract = {{This special issue of Forest Policy and Economics is based on the papers
   presented and discussions held at the International Conference on the
   New Frontiers of Forest Economics, June 26-30, 2012 held at ETH, Zurich,
   Switzerland. This paper discusses the need of new frontiers of forest
   economics, provides an overview of the special issue, and presents
   thoughts about new frontiers. The paper suggests that all knowledge of
   forest economists is conjectural, and without the competition of
   contradictorily theories forest economics sinks into intellectual
   poverty. The progress of forest economics will need a never ending
   fabrication on new and venturous theories for solving problems and
   strong attempts to refute, to critically assess and discuss, and to test
   empirically the new theories. The paper discusses three areas for new
   frontiers of forest economics - integration of sciences using
   multidisciplinary and transdisciplinaty approaches, incorporation and
   integration of various streams of economics, and answering the
   unanswered questions by developing new models and methods. Crown

Title = {{The Non-Gaussian Nature of Prostate Motion Based on Real-Time
   Intrafraction Tracking}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this work is to test the validity of the
   Gaussian approximation for prostate motion through characterization of
   its spatial distribution.
   Methods and Materials: Real-time intrafraction prostate motion was
   observed using Calypso 4-dimensional (4D) nonradioactive electromagnetic
   tracking system. We report the results from a total of 1024 fractions
   from 31 prostate cancer patients. First, the correlation of prostate
   motion in right/left (RL), anteroposterior (AP), and superoinferior (SI)
   direction were determined using Pearson's correlation of coefficient.
   Then the spatial distribution of prostate motion was analyzed for
   individual fraction, individual patient including all fractions, and all
   patients including all fractions. The displacement in RL, AP, SI,
   oblique, or total direction is fitted into a Gaussian distribution, and
   a Lilliefors test was used to evaluate the validity of the hypothesis
   that the displacement is normally distributed.
   Results: There is high correlation in AP/SI direction (61\% of fractions
   with medium or strong correlation). This is consistent with the
   longitudinal oblique motion of the prostate, and likely the effect from
   respiration on an organ confined within the genitourinary diaphragm with
   the rectum sitting posteriorly and bladder sitting superiorly. In all
   directions, the non-Gaussian distribution is more common for individual
   fraction, individual patient including all fractions, and all patients
   including all fractions. The spatial distribution of prostate motion
   shows an elongated shape in oblique direction, indicating a higher range
   of motion in the AP and SI directions.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that the prostate motion is highly
   correlated in AP and SI direction, indicating an oblique motion
   preference. In addition, the spatial distribution of prostate motion is
   elongated in an oblique direction, indicating that the organ motion
   dosimetric modeling using Gaussian kernel may need to be modified to
   account for the particular organ motion character of prostate. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Leveraging product differentiation and mass production efficiency in
   mass customization basically entails a configure-to-order paradigm. In
   the engineer-to-order (ETO) business, however, companies build unique
   products in response to `foreseeable' customer specifications. The key
   challenge of ETO mass customization lies in the complexity of
   accommodating future design changes when customers are involved in
   customizing design specifications. This paper proposes a two-stage,
   bi-level stochastic programming framework to tackle ETO mass
   customization. At the first stage, product platform configuration is
   integrated with production reconfiguration, which is formulated as a
   shortest path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC) to optimize
   production delays within the capabilities of the process platform.
   Benders' decomposition algorithm is applied to solve this optimal
   configuration problem owing to its high computational efficiency. The
   second stage scrutinizes the optimal configuration resulting from the
   first stage for scaling optimization of design parameters (DPs) for each
   module. All DPs are differentiated by standard or customizable DPs. A
   bi-level stochastic program is implemented to leverage conflicting goals
   between the producer (leader) and consumer (follower) surpluses. As a
   result, ETO customization design is anchored with optimal values of
   standard DPs and optimal value ranges of customizable DPs. A case study
   of ship engine and power generator ETO design is presented,
   demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the ETO mass
   customization framework.}},

Abstract = {{The prevailing practice of design for mass customization manifests
   itself through a configure-to-order paradigm, which means to satisfy
   explicit customer needs (CNs) and built upon legacy design. With
   pervasive connectivity and interactivity of the Internet and sensor
   networks, personalization has been witnessed in a number of industry
   sectors as a promising strategy that makes the market of one a reality.
   Mass personalization entails a strategy of producing goods and services
   to satisfy individual customer's latent needs with values outperforming
   costs for both customers and producers. This review paper envisions an
   affective and cognitive design perspective to mass personalization. By
   exploiting implicit market demand information and revealing latent CNs,
   mass personalization aspires to assist customers in making better
   informed decisions, and to the largest extent, to anticipate customer
   satisfaction and adapt to customer delight. The key dimensions of mass
   personalization are identified and discussed. By capitalizing on user
   experience, affective and cognitive design for mass personalization is
   expected to address individual customer's latent CNs. The decisions of
   affective and cognitive design, involving affective and cognitive needs
   elicitation, affective and cognitive analysis, and affective and
   cognitive fulfillment, are reviewed with a wide range of interests,
   including engineering design, human factors and ergonomics, engineering
   psychology, marketing, and human-computer interaction. Recent trends and
   future research directions are also speculated to inspire more
   meaningful research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study properties of general closed convex sets that
   determine the closedness and polyhedrality of the convex hull of integer
   points contained in it. We first present necessary and sufficient
   conditions for the convex hull of integer points contained in a general
   convex set to be closed. This leads to useful results for special
   classes of convex sets such as pointed cones, strictly convex sets, and
   sets containing integer points in their interior. We then present a
   sufficient condition for the convex hull of integer points in general
   convex sets to be a polyhedron. This result generalizes the well-known
   result due to Meyer (Math Program 7:223-225, 1974). Under a simple
   technical assumption, we show that these sufficient conditions are also
   necessary for the convex hull of integer points contained in general
   convex sets to be a polyhedron.}},

Abstract = {{Different forms of biomaterials, including microspheres, sponges,
   hydrogels, and nanofibers, have been broadly used in cartilage
   regeneration; however, effects of internal structures of the
   biomaterials on cells and chondrogenesis remain largely unexplored. We
   hypothesized that different internal structures of sponges and hydrogels
   led to phenotypic disparity of the cells and may lead to disparate
   chondrogenesis. In the current study, the chondrocytes in sponges and
   hydrogels of chitosan were compared with regard to cell distribution,
   morphology, gene expression, and production of extracellular matrix. The
   chondrocytes clustered or attached to the materials with spindle
   morphologies in the sponges, while they distributed evenly with
   spherical morphologies in the hydrogels. The chondrocytes proliferated
   faster with elevated gene expression of collagen type I and
   down-regulated gene expression of aggracan in sponges, when compared
   with those in the hydrogels. However, there was no significant
   difference of the expression of collagen type II between these two
   scaffolds. Excretion of both glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen type
   II increased with time in vitro, but there was no significant difference
   between the sponges and the hydrogels. There was no significant
   difference in secretion of GAG and collagen type II in the two
   scaffolds, while the levels of collagen type I and collagen type X were
   much higher in sponges compared with those in hydrogels during an in
   vivo study. Though the chondrocytes displayed different phenotypes in
   the sponges and hydrogels, they led to comparable chondrogenesis. An
   optimized design of the biomaterials could further improve
   chondrogenesis through enhancing functionalities of the chondrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) current provides an
   important modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission, which undergoes
   plastic regulation via multiple mechanisms. We examined whether
   inhibitory input processing is also dependent on SK current in the
   cerebellar nuclei (CN) where inhibition provides the only route of
   information transfer from the cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells. We
   employed dynamic clamping in conjunction with computer simulations to
   address this question. We found that SK current plays a critical role in
   the inhibitory synaptic control of spiking output. Specifically,
   regulation of SK current density resulted in a gain control of spiking
   output, such that low SK current promoted large output signaling for
   large inhibitory cell input fluctuations due to Purkinje cell
   synchronization. In contrast, smaller nonsynchronized Purkinje cell
   input fluctuations were not amplified. Regulation of SK density in the
   CN therefore would likely lead to important consequences for the
   transmission of synchronized Purkinje cell activity to the motor system.}},

Abstract = {{A novel and improved atomistic simulation based cohesive zone law
   characterizing interfacial debonding is developed which explicitly
   accounts for the non-planarity of the crack propagation. Group of atoms
   in the simulation constituting cohesive zones which are used to obtain
   local stress and crack opening displacement data are determined
   dynamically during the non-planar crack growth as they cannot be
   determined apriori. The methodology is used to study the debonding of
   Sigma 5 (2 1 0)/{[}001] symmetric tilt grain boundary interface in a Cu
   bicrystal under several mixed mode loading conditions. Simulations show
   that such bicrystalline specimen exhibits three types of energy
   dissipative mechanisms - shear coupled GB migration (SCM) away from the
   crack-tips, change in spacial orientation of GB structural units
   rendering highly disordered grain boundary near the crack tips and
   brittle intergranular fracture. Which combination of these three
   deformation mechanism will be active influencing the degree of
   non-planarity of the crack propagation at various stages of loading
   depends on the loading mode-mixity. As the ratio of shear component of
   the loading parallel to the GB plane and normal to the tilt axis with
   respect to the normal loading increases (thereby increasing the
   mode-mixity), overall strain-to-failure also increases and SCM tends to
   become the dominant deformation mechanism. Through this framework,
   analytical functional forms and parameters describing cohesive laws for
   both normal and shear traction as a function of the mode-mixity of the
   loading and crack opening displacement are predicted. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A reverse electrodialysis (RED) system utilizes the transport of cations
   and anions from controlled mixing of saline water (e.g., seawater) and
   freshwater (e.g., river water) through selective ion exchange membranes
   for power generation. Sodium chloride alone has been widely used to
   create power via salinity gradients in lab-scale RED systems. In an
   effort to simulate realistic salinity conditions in the natural water
   environment, in this study a new RED model was developed to quantify the
   power generation with coexisting monovalent and multivalent salt ions.
   The effects of different flow rate ratios (saline water flow, empty
   set(S), over freshwater flow, empty set(F)) and intermembrane distance
   ratios on power density (amount of power per unit membrane area) were
   investigated. Our results indicated that magnesium sulfate, sodium
   sulfate, and magnesium chloride in the feed solutions of the RED system
   led to a 9-20\% lower power density than when sodium chloride was the
   single ion source, largely because of the higher internal stack
   resistance of the multivalent ions. Higher power densities could be
   achieved with higher flow rates in the saline water compartment and
   shorter intermembrane distances in the freshwater compartment. For
   example, the power density increased by approximately 11\% when the flow
   rate ratio was 5 compared with 1; similarly, an intermembrane distance
   ratio of 8 yielded an approximately 85\% increase in power density
   compared with a ratio of 1. The goal of the present work is to advance
   our understanding of RED systems working in realistic salinity
   environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   photothermal therapy by loading indocyanine green (ICG) molecules into
   1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-{[}methoxy

   (SPIO) nanoparticles (NPs). It was proved that the obtained
   SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs with an average diameter around 27.4 nm could
   serve as an efficient probe to simultaneously enhance fluorescence
   imaging and magnetic resonance imaging greatly in vivo. After tail vein
   injection, the SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs were found selectively accumulate
   at the tumor site. Encapsulation of ICG into the lipid coating of SPIO
   NPs results in higher photostability than free ICG due to the protection
   from degradation. SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs exhibited significant
   photothermal cytotoxicity. Cancer cells could be killed in vitro and
   tumors could be ablated in vivo efficiently through photothermal effects
   of SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs under laser irradiation. In summary,
   SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs integrate multiple capabilities for effective
   tumor imaging and therapy. This is very helpful for accurately
   interpreting the obtained images, identifying the size and location of
   the tumor, as well as guiding and monitoring the photothermal therapy

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) is the most common cause of heart failure
   (HF), the leading cause of death in the developed world. Oxidative
   stress due to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   plays a key role in the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling leading to
   HF. NADPH oxidase with Nox2 as the catalytic subunit is a major source
   for cardiac ROS production. Nox2-NADPH expression is significantly
   increased in the infarcted myocardium, primarily in neutrophils,
   macrophages and myocytes. Moreover, mice lacking the Nox2 gene are
   protected from ischemic injury, implicating Nox2 as a potential
   therapeutic target. RNAi-mediated gene silencing holds great promise as
   a therapeutic owing to its high specificity and potency. However, in
   vivo delivery hurdles have limited its effective clinical use. Here, we
   demonstrate acid-degradable polyketal particles as delivery vehicles for
   Nox2-siRNA to the post-MI heart. In vitro, Nox2-5iRNA particles are
   effectively taken up by macrophages and significantly knockdown Nox2
   expression and activity. Following in vivo intramyocardial injection in
   experimental mice models of MI, Nox2-siRNA particles prevent
   upregulation of Nox2 and significantly recovered cardiac function. This
   study highlights the potential of polyketals as siRNA delivery vehicles
   to the MI heart and represents a viable therapeutic approach for
   targeting oxidative stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   polycaprolactone diol, 4,4-methylen bis (cyclohexyl isocyanate) (HMDI),
   and either L-glutathione or its constituent amino acids (L-glutamic
   acid, L-cysteine and glycine) as chain extenders. Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed the feasibility of obtaining
   polyurethanes through the presence of NH (Amide II), C-N, C-O, and C=O
   bands and the absence of NCO band. Differential scanning calorimetry and
   X-ray diffraction revealed that a semicrystalline polymer (T-m=42-52
   degrees C; 2=21.3 degrees and 23 degrees) was obtained in all cases,
   while dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed an amorphous phase
   (T-g=-30 to -36(o)C). These properties, in addition to their high
   molecular weight, led to high moduli and higher extensibilities when
   glycine and glutamic acid were used as chain extenders. Clotting times
   (Lee-White test) and activated partial thromboplastin time determined on
   these polyurethanes were longer than with glass. In addition, all
   synthesized SPU exhibited platelet activation indexes below the collagen
   type I positive control. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   viability was higher in SPUs containing either glycine or cysteine. The
   obtained results indicate that SPUs that use cysteine as chain extender
   are promising candidates for cardiovascular applications.}},

Title = {{Space-time measurements of oceanic sea states}},
Journal = {{OCEAN MODELLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{103-115}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Stereo video techniques are effective for estimating the space-time wave
   dynamics over an area of the ocean. Indeed, a stereo camera view allows
   retrieval of both spatial and temporal data whose statistical content is
   richer than that of time series data retrieved from point wave probes.
   We present an application of the Wave Acquisition Stereo System (WASS)
   for the analysis of offshore video measurements of gravity waves in the
   Northern Adriatic Sea and near the southern seashore of the Crimean
   peninsula, in the Black Sea. We use classical epipolar techniques to
   reconstruct the sea surface from the stereo pairs sequentially in time,
   viz. a sequence of spatial snapshots. We also present a variational
   approach that exploits the entire data image set providing a global
   space-time imaging of the sea surface, viz. simultaneous reconstruction
   of several spatial snapshots of the surface in order to guarantee
   continuity of the sea surface both in space and time. Analysis of the
   WASS measurements show that the sea surface can be accurately estimated
   in space and time together, yielding associated directional spectra and
   wave statistics at a point in time that agrees well with probabilistic
   models. In particular, WASS stereo imaging is able to capture typical
   features of the wave surface, especially the crest-to-trough asymmetry
   due to second order nonlinearities, and the observed shape of large
   waves are fairly described by theoretical models based on the theory of
   quasi-determinism (Boccotti, 2000). Further, we investigate space-time
   extremes of the observed stationary sea states, viz. the largest surface
   wave heights expected over a given area during the sea state duration.
   The WASS analysis provides the first experimental proof that a
   space-time extreme is generally larger than that observed in time via
   point measurements, in agreement with the predictions based on
   stochastic theories for global maxima of Gaussian fields. (C) 2013

   academic researcher examining InfoVis and VAST conference papers and a
   consumer exploring car reviews while pondering a purchase decision.
   Finally, we provide lessons learned toward the design and implementation

Abstract = {{Stem cell fate and specification is largely controlled by extrinsic cues
   that comprise the 3D microenvironment Biomaterials can serve to control
   the spatial and temporal presentation of morphogenic molecules in order
   to direct stem cell fate decisions. Here we describe a microparticle
   (MP)-based approach to deliver growth factors within multicellular
   aggregates to direct pluripotent stem cell differentiation. Compared to
   conventional soluble delivery methods, gelatin MPs laden with BMP4 or
   noggin induced efficient gene expression of mesoderm and ectoderm
   lineages, respectively, despite using nearly 12-fold less total growth
   factor. BMP4-laden MPs increased the percentage of cells expressing GFP
   under the control of the Brachyury-T promoter as visualized by
   whole-mount confocal imaging and quantified by flow cytometry.
   Furthermore, the ability to localize MPs laden with different morphogens
   within a particular hemisphere of stem cell aggregates allowed for
   spatial control of differentiation within 3D cultures. Overall,
   localized delivery of growth factors within multicellular aggregates
   from microparticle delivery vehicles is an important step towards
   scalable differentiation technologies and the study of morphogen
   gradients in pluripotent stem cell differentiation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The combustion wave propagation of nanoaluminum-water mixtures is
   studied theoretically and experimentally for particles in the size range
   of 38-130 nm and over a pressure range of 1-10 MPa. A multi-zone
   framework is established to predict the burning properties and flame
   structure by solving the conservation equations in each zone and
   enforcing the mass and energy continuities at the interfacial
   boundaries. The flame properties are measured by burning
   nanoaluminum-water strands in a constant-volume vessel. The present
   study deals with the downward propagating flame. Emphasis is placed on
   the effects of particle size and pressure. An analytical expression for
   the burning rate is derived, and physicochemical parameters that dictate
   the flame behavior are identified. For conditions present in the study,
   the burning rate shows pressure and particle size dependencies of the
   form r(b) {[}cm/s] = 98.8 x (p {[}MPa])(0.32)(d(p) {[}nm])(-10). The
   flame thickness increases with increasing particle size and decreasing
   pressure. Results support the hypothesis that the combustion of
   aluminum-water mixtures is controlled by mass diffusion across the oxide
   layers of the particles. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a discriminative dynamic Gaussian mixture
   selection (DGMS) strategy to generate reliable accent-specific units
   (ASUs) for multi-accent speech recognition. Time-aligned phone
   recognition is used to generate the ASUs that model accent variations
   explicitly and accurately. DGMS reconstructs and adjusts a pre-trained
   set of hidden Markov model (HMM) state densities to build dynamic
   observation densities for each input speech frame. A discriminative
   minimum classification error criterion is adopted to optimize the sizes
   of the HMM state observation densities with a genetic algorithm (GA). To
   the author's knowledge, the discriminative optimization for DGMS
   accomplishes discriminative training of discrete variables that is first
   proposed. We found the proposed framework is able to cover more
   multi-accent changes, thus reduce some performance loss in pruned beam
   search, without increasing the model size of the original acoustic model
   set. Evaluation on three typical Chinese accents, Chuan, Yue and Wu,
   shows that our approach outperforms traditional acoustic model
   reconstruction techniques with a syllable error rate reduction of 8.0\%,
   5.5\% and 5.0\%, respectively, while maintaining a good performance on
   standard Putonghua speech.}},

Abstract = {{Model adaptation techniques are an efficient way to reduce the mismatch
   that typically occurs between the training and test condition of any
   automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. This work addresses the
   problem of increased degradation in performance when moving from
   speaker-dependent (SD) to speaker-independent (SI) conditions for
   connectionist (or hybrid) hidden Markov model/artificial neural network
   (HMM/ANN) systems in the context of large vocabulary continuous speech
   recognition (LVCSR). Adapting hybrid HMM/ANN systems on a small amount
   of adaptation data has been proven to be a difficult task, and has been
   a limiting factor in the widespread deployment of hybrid techniques in
   operational ASR systems. Addressing the crucial issue of speaker
   adaptation (SA) for hybrid HMM/ANN system can thereby have a great
   impact on the connectionist paradigm, which will play a major role in
   the design of next-generation LVCSR considering the great success
   reported by deep neural networks-ANNs with many hidden layers that
   adopts the pre-training technique-on many speech tasks. Current
   adaptation techniques for ANNs based on injecting an adaptable linear
   transformation network connected to either the input, or the output
   layer are not effective especially with a small amount of adaptation
   data, e. g., a single adaptation utterance. In this paper, a novel
   solution is proposed to overcome those limits and make it robust to
   scarce adaptation resources. The key idea is to adapt the hidden
   activation functions rather than the network weights. The adoption of
   Hermitian activation functions makes this possible. Experimental results
   on an LVCSR task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Among primates, humans are uniquely vulnerable to many age-related
   neurodegenerative disorders. We used structural and diffusion magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the brains of chimpanzees and rhesus
   monkeys across each species' adult lifespan, and compared these results
   with published findings in humans. As in humans, gray matter volume
   decreased with age in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Also like humans,
   chimpanzees showed a trend for decreased white matter volume with age,
   but this decrease occurred proportionally later in the chimpanzee
   lifespan than in humans. Diffusion MRI revealed widespread age-related
   decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in radial diffusivity
   in chimpanzees and macaques. However, both the fractional anisotropy
   decline and the radial diffusivity increase started at a proportionally
   earlier age in humans than in chimpanzees. Thus, even though overall
   patterns of gray and white matter aging are similar in humans and
   chimpanzees, the longer lifespan of humans provides more time for white
   matter to deteriorate before death, with the result that some
   neurological effects of aging may be exacerbated in our species. (C)

   show that the ultimate mechanical strength deteriorates exponentially as

Abstract = {{The objective of the current study is to analyze the slot die coating
   process of highly viscous (1-20 Pa s), shear-thinning solutions. The
   upper and lower coating boundaries are determined with respect to
   various non-dimensional parameters. Polyphosphoric acid doped
   polybenzamidazole (PPA/PBI) solutions are used as the test solutions.
   Simulations are performed using 2D, volume-of-fluid (VOF) model
   available in FLUENT 6.3.26 to predict the coating windows. The
   numerically predicted coating window compared within +/- 4\% of the
   experimental data. Design of Experiments (DOE) is performed to
   understand the impact of operational and processing conditions on the
   coating windows. It is observed that the air engulfment could be delayed
   by using smaller coating gaps and higher processing temperatures, which
   would facilitate faster processing of thin films, an important attribute
   during industrial scale processing. One major contribution from the
   study is the development of a semi-empirical model, in which operational
   and processing parameters are supplied as inputs to predict the air
   engulfment velocity within +/- 10\% accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Dynamic simulation of concentrated macromolecular solutions with

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic interactions exert a critical effect on the dynamics of
   macromolecules. As the concentration of macromolecules increases, by
   analogy to the behavior of semidilute polymer solutions or the flow in
   porous media, one might expect hydrodynamic screening to occur.
   Hydrodynamic screening would have implications both for the
   understanding of macromolecular dynamics as well as practical
   implications for the simulation of concentrated macromolecular
   solutions, e. g., in cells. Stokesian dynamics (SD) is one of the most
   accurate methods for simulating the motions of N particles suspended in
   a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number, in that it considers both
   far-field and near-field hydrodynamic interactions. This algorithm
   traditionally involves an O(N-3) operation to compute Brownian forces at
   each time step, although asymptotically faster but more complex SD
   methods are now available. Motivated by the idea of hydrodynamic
   screening, the far-field part of the hydrodynamic matrix in SD may be
   approximated by a diagonal matrix, which is equivalent to assuming that
   long range hydrodynamic interactions are completely screened. This
   approximation allows sparse matrix methods to be used, which can reduce
   the apparent computational scaling to O(N). Previously there were
   several simulation studies using this approximation for monodisperse
   suspensions. Here, we employ newly designed preconditioned iterative
   methods for both the computation of Brownian forces and the solution of
   linear systems, and consider the validity of this approximation in
   polydisperse suspensions. We evaluate the accuracy of the diagonal
   approximation method using an intracellular-like suspension. The
   diffusivities of particles obtained with this approximation are close to
   those with the original method. However, this approximation
   underestimates intermolecular correlated motions, which is a trade-off
   between accuracy and computing efficiency. The new method makes it
   possible to perform large-scale and long-time simulation with an
   approximate accounting of hydrodynamic interactions. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Mitral annuloplasty has been a keystone to the success of mitral valve
   repair in functional mitral regurgitation. Understanding the complex
   interplay between annular-ring stresses and left ventricular function
   has significant implications for patient-ring selection, repair failure,
   and patient safety. A step towards assessing these challenges is
   developing a transducer that can be implanted in the exact method as
   commercially available rings and can quantify multidirectional ring
   loading. An annuloplasty ring transducer was developed to measure
   stresses at eight locations on both the in-plane and out-of-plane
   surfaces of an annuloplasty rings titanium core. The transducer was
   implanted in an ovine subject using 10 sutures at near symmetric
   locations. At implantation, the ring was observed to undersize the
   mitral annulus. The flaccid annulus exerted both compressive (-) and
   tensile stresses (+) on the ring ranging from -3.17 to 534 MPa. At
   baseline hemodynamics, stresses cyclically changed and peaked near
   mid-systole. Mean changes in cyclic stress from ventricular diastole to
   mid-systole ranged from -0.61 to 0.46 MPa (in-plane direction) and from
   -0.49 to 1.13 MPa (out-of-plane direction). Results demonstrate the
   variability in ring stresses that can be introduced during implantation
   and the cyclic contraction of the mitral annulus. Ring stresses at
   implantation were approximately 4 magnitudes larger than the cyclic
   changes in stress throughout the cardiac cycle. These methods will be
   extended to ring transducers of differing size and geometry. Upon
   additional investigation, these data will contribute to improved
   knowledge of annulus-ring stresses, LV function, and the safer
   development of mitral repair techniques. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We describe a technique for the fabrication of dense and patterned
   arrays of aligned silicon oxide nanowires for applications in surface
   modification, optoelectronic, and electromechanical based devices.
   Conventional techniques for the fabrication of silicon oxide nanowires
   based on the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   processes involve the use of high temperatures and catalysts. We
   demonstrate a technique that extends the use of a plasma thermal
   reactive ion etching for the fabrication of aligned silicon oxide
   nanowires with aspect ratios extending up to 20 and lengths exceeding 1
   mu m. The process incorporates phase separated PS-b-P4VP block copolymer
   loaded with an iron salt. The iron salt preferentially segregates into
   the P4VP layer and during an O-2 etch is not removed but forms a
   hexagonally packed array on the silicon oxide substrate. Further etching
   with CHF3/O-2 gas mixture over time can generate nanodots, to
   nanopillars, and then nanowires of silicon oxide. The photoluminescence
   property of the as-fabricated nanowire arrays as well as the parasitic
   ferromagnetic effect from the iron oxide-tipped section of the wires
   resulting in coalescence under an scanning electron microscope (SEM) are
   demonstrated. This technique is simpler compared to existing VLS
   fabrication approaches and can be used for the direct fabrication of
   patterned arrays of nanowires when a laser interference ablation step is
   incorporated into the fabrication procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically inspired materials and structures with tailored biological,

   actively modulate and protect cell function in hostile and synthetic

   microgels, and ultrathin capsules derived from inorganic, polymeric,
   biomolecular, or nanoparticle materials applicable to various protective
   and interaction mediating applications. These biomimetic cell coatings
   can dramatically increase cell viability and stability in a hostile

   biotechnology, and bioelectronics applications. Some of the most recent
   studies of traditional inorganic and organic gels, polymeric and

   polymers and proteins are also discussed. Proper selection of chemical
   composition and assembly conditions has potential to dramatically
   enhance viability of encapsulated cells by increasing their mechanical
   stability, masking the cell surface from immunological agents,
   increasing mechanical stability, and providing chemical resistance to

Abstract = {{Hierarchically-porous, rigid inorganic structures have attracted
   appreciable interest in a wide range of applications, including
   catalysis, filtration, sensing, and energy storage/harvesting.
   Naturally-occurring, hierarchically-porous, rigid assemblies with a wide
   range of three-dimensional (3D) structures are generated by diatoms
   (photosynthetic aquatic microorganisms); that is, each of the tens of
   thousands of diatom species forms a macro-to-mesoporous, silica-bearing
   cell wall (frustule) with a particular, highly-reproducible 3D
   morphology. We have recently demonstrated that such intricate biosilica
   structures can be converted, without loss of 3D morphology, into high
   surface area (>1300 m(2)/g) macro-to-microporous carbon. Here we
   demonstrate, for the first time, how the chemical tailoring of such
   hierarchically-porous, carbon-converted, 3D biogenic structures can
   result in a high degree of enzyme loading for rapid flow-through
   catalysis. Two approaches have been developed for enriching such
   structures with carboxylic acid groups: i) dendritic amplification of
   partially-oxidized C replicas, and ii) electrochemical Au deposition
   followed by self-assembly of a carboxylic acid-bearing surface layer.
   The terminal carboxylic acid groups were then used for electrostatic
   attachment of a protamine (PA) modified derivative of the model enzyme,
   glucose oxidase (GOx-PA). In a flow-through system, the GOx-PA-loaded,
   diatom-derived microscale structures displayed a glucose consumption
   rate more than 80\% faster than for GOx-PA-loaded C black and Au
   nanoparticles. The rapid flow-through catalysis of the carbon and
   gold-bearing frustule replicas was enabled by the open 3D morphology of
   the starting diatom silica templates, along with the enhanced surface
   area and high enzyme loading resulting from the chemical conversion and
   surface functionalization processes.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal and hydrodynamic performance of liquid active cooling
   devices was investigated for possible applications in the thermal
   management of high-power LED arrays fabricated on InGaN/sapphire chips.
   A microjet solution and a series of minichannel cold plates were
   investigated using full 3-D numerical simulations. An optimization based
   on entropy generation minimization was performed with goal of reducing
   the frictional pressure losses in the various minichannel geometries
   evaluated. The effective thermal resistance, pressure drop and pumping
   power requirements were calculated for all the cold plates investigated.
   The results of the entropy generation minimization process indicated
   that the minichannel cold plate had a lower flow resistance than the
   base design reported in previous investigations. Due to the different
   length scales presented in this problem, a small-scale model was
   developed using a simple thermal resistance formulation for the chips,
   in order to calculate the chip Junction temperature at different
   operating conditions. Overall, it was found that the minichannel cold
   plate design is a better thermal management option than microjets for
   the cooling of high-power LEDs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The role of Bone Tissue Engineering in the field of Regenerative
   Medicine has been the topic of substantial research over the past two
   decades. Technological advances have improved orthopaedic implants and
   surgical techniques for bone reconstruction. However, improvements in
   surgical techniques to reconstruct bone have been limited by the paucity
   of autologous materials available and donor site morbidity. Recent
   advances in the development of biomaterials have provided attractive
   alternatives to bone grafting expanding the surgical options for
   restoring the form and function of injured bone. Specifically, novel
   bioactive (second generation) biomaterials have been developed that are
   characterised by controlled action and reaction to the host tissue
   environment, whilst exhibiting controlled chemical breakdown and
   resorption with an ultimate replacement by regenerating tissue. Future
   generations of biomaterials (third generation) are designed to be not
   only osteo-conductive but also osteoinductive, i.e. to stimulate
   regeneration of host tissues by combining tissue engineering and in situ
   tissue regeneration methods with a focus on novel applications. These
   techniques will lead to novel possibilities for tissue regeneration and
   repair. At present, tissue engineered constructs that may find future
   use as bone grafts for complex skeletal defects, whether from
   post-traumatic, degenerative, neoplastic or congenital/developmental
   ``origin{''} require osseous reconstruction to ensure structural and
   functional integrity. Engineering functional bone using combinations of
   cells, scaffolds and bioactive factors is a promising strategy and a
   particular feature for future development in the area of hybrid
   materials which are able to exhibit suitable biomimetic and mechanical
   properties. This review will discuss the state of the art in this field
   and what we can expect from future generations of bone regeneration
   concepts.}},

Abstract = {{A facile, robust approach to the synthesis of Au cubic nanoframes is
   described. The synthesis involves three major steps: 1) preparation of
   Au-Ag alloyed nanocages using a galvanic replacement reaction between Ag
   nanocubes and HAuCl4; 2) deposition of thin layers of pure Au onto the
   surfaces of the nanocages by reducing HAuCl4 with ascorbic acid, and; 3)
   formation of Au cubic nanoframes through a dealloying process with
   HAuCl4. The key to the formation of Au cubic nanoframes is to coat the
   surfaces of the Au-Ag nanocages with sufficiently thick layers of Au
   before they are dealloyed. The Au layer could prevent the skeleton of a
   nanocage from being fragmented during the dealloying step. The
   as-prepared Au cubic nanoframes exhibit tunable localized surface
   plasmon resonance peaks in the near-infrared region, but with much lower
   Ag content as compared with the initial Au-Ag nanocages.}},

Abstract = {{Natural protein (silk fibroin) nanoshells are assembled on the surface
   of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells without compromising their
   viability. The nanoshells facilitate initial protection of the cells and
   allow them to function in encapsulated state for some time period,
   afterwards being completely biodegraded and consumed by the cells. In
   contrast to a traditional methanol treatment, the gentle ionic treatment
   suggested here stabilizes the shell silk fibroin structure but does not
   compromise the viability of the cells, as indicated by the fast response
   of the encapsulated cells, with an immediate activation by the inducer
   molecules. Extremely high viability rates (up to 97\%) and preserved
   activity of encapsulated cells are facilitated by cytocompatibility of
   the natural proteins and the formation of highly porous shells in
   contrast to traditional polyelectrolyte-based materials. Moreover, in a
   high contrast to traditional synthetic shells, the silk proteins are
   biodegradable and can be consumed by cells at a later stage of growth,
   thus releasing the cells from their temporary protective capsules. These
   on-demand encapsulated cells can be considered a valuable platform for
   biocompatible and biodegradable cell encapsulation, controlled cell
   protection in a synthetic environment, transfer to a device environment,
   and cell implantation followed by biodegradation and consumption of

Abstract = {{We have studied the properties of thick InxGa1-xN films, with indium
   content ranging from x similar to 0.22 to 0.67, grown by metal-modulated
   epitaxy. While the low indium-content films exhibit high density of
   stacking faults and dislocations, a significant improvement in the
   crystalline quality and optical properties has been observed starting at
   x similar to 0.6. Surprisingly, the InxGa1-xN film with x similar to
   0.67 exhibits high luminescence intensity, low defect density, and
   uniform full lattice-mismatch strain relaxation. The efficient strain
   relaxation is shown to be due to a critical thickness close to the
   monolayer range. These films were grown at low temperatures (similar to
   400 degrees C) to facilitate indium incorporation and with precursor
   modulation to enhance surface morphology and metal adlayer diffusion.
   These findings should contribute to the development of growth techniques
   for nitride semiconductors under high lattice misfit conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{In general, there are two major factors affecting bandgaps in
   nanostructures: (i) the enhanced electron-electron interactions due to
   confinement and (ii) the modified self-energy of electrons due to the
   dielectric screening. While recent theoretical studies on graphene
   nanoribbons (GNRs) report on the first effect, the effect of dielectric
   screening from the surrounding materials such as substrates has not been
   thoroughly investigated. Using large-scale electronic structure
   calculations based on the GW approach, we show that when GNRs are
   deposited on substrates, bandgaps get strongly suppressed (by as much as
   1 eV) even though the GNR-substrate interaction is weak. (C) 2013 AIP

   Insights from density functional theory and X-ray diffraction}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{The electronic properties of Ta-W-O system have been studied using
   density functional theory with PBE0 hybrid functional. The bandgap
   calculations showed a large and composition-dependent bowing parameter.
   While the large bowing parameter at low W content (<25\%) is related to
   the charge exchange between the localized W 5d state and the extended
   states in the conduction band, the volume change is considered the main
   reason for the large bowing parameter at high W content (>25\%). The
   electron excitation from the Ta2O5 valence band to WO3 conduction band
   at high W content may contribute to the pronounced decrease in the
   conduction band energy. The staggered bandgap type between Ta2O5 and
   WO3, as revealed from the energy band diagram, resulted in efficient
   charge carriers' separation. The minimum hole effective mass occurs
   along the y-direction and decreases monotonically with increasing W
   content. Combining the wide tunability of bandgap with the small
   effective mass, it is suggested that Ta-W-O alloys can replace the
   various III-V materials for high efficiency solar cells as well as other
   optoelectronic devices. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have systematically investigated the
   polarization-insensitive and broad-angle self-collimation behavior in a
   square-lattice two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) with rectangular
   air holes. By analyzing the band structures and the corresponding
   equi-frequency contours (EFCs), it is found that such PhC can show
   special dispersion properties when the half-length L and half-width W of
   rectangular air holes are appropriately changed. First, compared with
   conventional square-lattice PhCs with circular or square air holes, such
   PhC is easier to support polarization-insensitive self-collimation
   (PISC) based on the EFCs for the second band. Meanwhile, the PISC
   behavior such as working frequency range and effective incident angle
   can be more flexibly adjusted by changing the structural parameters of
   rectangular air holes. Second, such PhC can show long flat EFCs for the
   TM-3 band. This is quite helpful for supporting broad-angle
   self-collimation. In particular, when L=0.5a and W/L=0.8, this PhC will
   degenerate to a one-dimensional grating PhC. It can show good all-angle
   self-collimation behavior with an improved relative bandwidth (about
   19.98\%) compared with previous works. It also presents advantages in
   practical applications due to a relatively convenient fabrication
   process.(C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we attempted to synthesize homoeriodictyol by transferring
   one methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to eriodictyol using
   flavone 3'-O-methyltransferase ROMT-9, which was produced by recombinant
   Yarrowia lipolytica. Specifically, the ROMT-9 gene from rice was
   synthesized and cloned into the multi-copy integrative vector pINA1297,
   and was further expressed in Y. lipolytica with a growth phase-dependent
   constitutive promoter hp4d. The highest ROMT-9 activity reached 5.53 U/L
   after 4 days of culture in shake flask. The optimal pH and temperature
   of the purified ROMT-9 were 8.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The
   purified enzyme was stable up to 40 degrees C, and retained more than
   80\% of its maximal activity between pH 6.5 and 9.0. The recombinant
   ROMT-9 did not require Mg2+ for catalysis, while was completely
   inhibited in the presence of 5 mM Zn2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Al3+, or Ni2+. The
   purified ROMT-9 was used to synthesize homoeriodictyol, and the maximal
   transformation ratio reached 52.4\% at 16 h under the following
   conditions: eriodictyol 0.2 g/L, ROMT-9 0.16 g/L, SAM 0.2 g/L, CH3OH 6\%
   (v/v), temperature 37 degrees C, and pH 8.0. This work provides an
   alternative strategy for efficient synthesis of homoeriodictyol and
   compared to the traditional plant extraction or chemical synthesis, the
   biotransformation approach generates less environmental pollution and
   has a great potential for the sustainable production of homoeriodictyol.

Abstract = {{Five samples of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were isolated from
   Barataria Bay, Louisiana using the coupled reverse
   osmosis/electrodialysis method. Two of the samples (BU) were isolated
   from relatively pristine waters and three samples (BC) were isolated
   from waters that were strongly impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil
   spill in April-July, 2010. The acid-base properties of these five
   samples were investigated by potentiometric titration. Carboxyl contents
   were estimated using an empirical pH-based method, and carboxyl
   contents, average pK(a)'s, and the range of plc in each sample were
   determined by fitting two numerical models (the Gaussian distribution
   model and the modified Henderson-Hasselbalch model) to the titration
   data. The carboxyl contents of the titrated samples range from 6.0 to
   6.9 meg gC(-1) and the average pK(a)'s for carboxyl groups range from
   4.0 to 4.6. The distribution of pK(a) values is somewhat broader for the
   BU samples than for the BC samples, but all other acid-base properties
   of the five samples were comparable. Phenolic hydroxyl groups could not
   be detected in any of the samples. These samples of coastal DOM are much
   less acidic than fulvic acids from soils and fresh waters. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{To improve cell performance, the effects of heat treatment time on the
   electrochemical properties and electrode structure of PTFE-bonded
   membrane electrode assemblies for PBI-based high-temperature proton
   exchange membrane fuel cells are investigated. The cell performance is
   observed to decrease in the high-current-density region rather than in
   the low-current-density region with increasing heat treatment time at
   350 degrees C from 1 to 30 min. Microscopic studies reveal remarkable
   differences in the electrode structure by the agglomeration of dispersed
   PTFE and adjacent catalyst particles, depending on the heat treatment
   time. As the heat treatment time increases, only the large pore
   (secondary pore) volume in the electrode decreases, resulting in
   increase in mass transport resistance and concentration overpotential in
   the high-current-density region. Cell performance is not measured
   without heat treatment because the electrodes are not formed. When the
   electrodes are heat treated for 1 min at 350 degrees C, the best cell
   performance is obtained, 0.67 V at 200 mA cm(-2). Copyright (C) 2013,

   system. The R134/{[}bmim]{[}PF6] pair was compared to previous studies
   using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a) and the same IL. The
   R134/{[}bmim] {[}PF6] fluid pair had up to 923\% greater
   cooling-to-total-energy efficiency than the R134a/{[}bmini]{[}PF6] fluid
   pair even though R134 and R134a are isomers and have nearly identical

Abstract = {{Dissolution, aggregation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
   are three major processes that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) undergo in
   aqueous environments. In this study, the effects of AgNP surface
   coatings on these three processes were systematically evaluated under
   three irradiation conditions (UV-365, UV-254, and xenon lamp) to advance
   knowledge on the environmental fate and photochemical kinetics of AgNPs.
   The AgNPs used were (a) bare-AgNPs, (b) electrostatically stabilized
   citrate-AgNPs, and (c) sterically stabilized polyvinylpyrrolidone-AgNPs
   (PVP-AgNPs), and the light exposures greatly promoted the three
   processes. Both the 5-h released Ag+ concentrations and the 2.5-h
   aggregation rate followed the order UV-365 > xenon lamp > UV-254 for all
   three types of AgNPs. For all irradiation conditions, the 5-h released
   Ag+ concentration was highest for bare-AgNPs, followed by PVP-AgNPs and
   citrate-AgNPs; the 2.5-h aggregation rate was highest for bare-AgNPs,
   followed by citrate-AgNPs and PVP-AgNPs, which indicated that surface
   coating significantly determines the process kinetics of AgNPs. Under
   UV-365 irradiation, the bare-AgNPs generated superoxide and hydroxyl
   radicals, but the citrate-AgNPs yielded only superoxide radical, and the
   PVP-AgNPs did not generate any ROS. This study highlights the different
   fates and kinetic behaviors of AgNPs during photochemical interactions,
   providing important insight into the environmental implications of AgNP
   release.}},

Abstract = {{Adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) would affect the costs and sources
   of electricity and the United States efficiency requirements for
   conventional vehicles (CVs). We model EV adoption scenarios in each of
   six regions of the Eastern Interconnection, containing 70\% of the
   United States population. We develop electricity system optimization
   models at the multidecade, day-ahead, and hour-ahead time scales,
   incorporating spatial wind energy modeling, endogenous modeling of CV
   efficiencies, projections for EV efficiencies, and projected CV and EV
   costs. We find two means to reduce total consumer expenditure (TCE): (i)
   controlling charge timing and (ii) unlinking the fuel economy
   regulations for CVs from EVs. Although EVs provide minimal direct GHG
   reductions, controlled charging provides load flexibility, lowering the
   cost of renewable electricity. Without EVs, a 33\% renewable electricity
   standard (RES) would cost \$193/vehicle-year more than the reference
   case (10\% RES). Combining a 33\% RES, EVs with controlled charging and
   unlinking would reduce combined electric- and vehicle-sector CO2
   emissions by 27\% and reduce gasoline consumption by 59\% for
   \$40/vehicle-year more than the reference case. Coordinating EV adoption
   with adoption of controlled charging, unlinked fuel economy regulations,
   and renewable electricity standards would provide low-cost reductions in
   emissions and fuel usage.}},

   pressed samples. Small-scale breakthrough testing was conducted with
   CuBTC against ammonia, which probes the reactive sites, and UiO-66
   against octane, which probes physical adsorption capacity. Even with the
   decrease in surface area, the CuBTC materials had consistent ammonia
   removal capacities, while the UiO-66 pressed materials showed a slight
   decrease in octane loadings. Data indicate that pressing these MOFs into
   pellets without a binder is a viable approach to engineering particles
   in support of filtration and other applications. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper reviews results of our recent studies of diffusion of gaseous
   sorbates in nanotube systems. C-13 pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR at
   17.6 T was used to probe diffusion of tetrafluoromethane in
   aluminosilicate nanotubes at several sorbate loadings. The results of
   PFG NMR measurements were compared with the corresponding data obtained
   by molecular dynamics simulations. The diffusion in this system was
   found to follow the laws of normal (i.e. Fickian) transport. At the same
   time, experimental data pointing at single-file diffusion were recorded
   for xenon gas confined inside dipeptide L-alanyl L-valine (AV)
   nanotubes. These data were obtained by means of high field Xe-129 PFG
   NMR. The PFG NMR data are compared with recently reported hyperpolarized
   tracer exchange Xe-129 NMR in the same material. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Inspired by biomineralization, biomimetic approaches utilize
   biomolecules and synthetic analogs to produce materials of controlled
   chemistry, morphology, and function under relatively benign conditions.
   A common characteristic of biological and biomimetic mineral-forming
   processes is the generation of mineral/biomolecule nanocomposites. In
   this work, it is demonstrated that a facile chemical reaction may be
   utilized to halogenate the nitrogen-containing moieties of the organics
   entrapped within bio-inorganic composites to yield halamine compounds.
   This process provides rapid and potent bactericidal activity to
   biomimetically and biologically produced materials that otherwise lack
   such functionality. Additionally, bio-inorganic composites containing
   the chlorinated peptide protamine are effective in rapidly neutralizing
   Bacillus spores (99.97\% reduction in colony forming units within 10
   min). The straightforward nature of the described process, and the
   efficacy of halamine compounds in neutralizing biological and chemical
   agents, provide new applicability to biogenic and biomimetic materials.}},

Organization = {{IEEE}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genome annotation is a crucial component of RNA-seq data
   analysis. Much effort has been devoted to producing an accurate and
   rational annotation of the human genome. An annotated genome provides a
   comprehensive catalogue of genomic functional elements. Currently, at
   least six human genome annotations are publicly available, including
   AceView Genes, Ensembl Genes, H-InvDB Genes, RefSeq Genes, UCSC Known
   Genes, and Vega Genes. Characteristics of these annotations differ
   because of variations in annotation strategies and information sources.
   When performing RNA-seq data analysis, researchers need to choose a
   genome annotation. However, the effect of genome annotation choice on
   downstream RNA-seq expression estimates is still unclear. This study (1)
   investigates the effect of different genome annotations on RNA-seq
   quantification and (2) provides guidelines for choosing a genome
   annotation based on research focus.
   Results: We define the complexity of human genome annotations in terms
   of the number of genes, isoforms, and exons. This definition facilitates
   an investigation of potential relationships between complexity and
   variations in RNA-seq quantification. We apply several evaluation
   metrics to demonstrate the impact of genome annotation choice on RNA-seq
   expression estimates. In the mapping stage, the least complex genome
   annotation, RefSeq Genes, appears to have the highest percentage of
   uniquely mapped short sequence reads. In the quantification stage,
   RefSeq Genes results in the most stable expression estimates in terms of
   the average coefficient of variation over all genes. Stable expression
   estimates in the quantification stage translate to accurate statistics
   for detecting differentially expressed genes. We observe that RefSeq
   Genes produces the most accurate fold-change measures with respect to a
   ground truth of RT-qPCR gene expression estimates.
   Conclusions: Based on the observed variations in the mapping,
   quantification, and differential expression calling stages, we
   demonstrate that the selection of human genome annotation results in
   different gene expression estimates. When conducting research that
   emphasizes reproducible and robust gene expression estimates, a less
   complex genome annotation may be preferred. However, simpler genome
   annotations may limit opportunities for identifying or characterizing
   novel transcriptional or regulatory mechanisms. When conducting research
   that aims to be more exploratory, a more complex genome annotation may
   be preferred.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{101-113}},

Abstract = {{Partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) serve as powerful
   tools to model stochastic systems with partial state information. Since
   the exact solution methods for POMDPs are limited to problems with very
   small sizes of state, action and observation spaces, approximate
   point-based solution methods like PERSEUS have gained popularity. In
   this work, a mixed integer linear program (MILP) is developed for
   calculation of exact value updates (in PERSEUS and similar algorithms),
   when the POMDP has very large or continuous action space. Since the
   solution time of the MILP is very sensitive to the size of the
   observation space, the concept of post-decision belief space is
   introduced to generate a more efficient and flexible model. An example
   involving a flow network is presented to illustrate the concepts and
   compare the results with those of the existing techniques. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{One-dimensional core-shell nanostructured electrodes made of aligned
   TiO2 nanotubes (NTs)/ZnO were fabricated via the thermal sputtering of
   ZnO layers on anodically fabricated titania NTs. Increasing the ZnO
   sputtering time resulted in the increase in the shell thickness, which
   in turn showed different morphological, structural, and optical
   characteristics. The crystallinity of the core nanotubes was found to be
   a determinant factor in the formation of the NTs/ZnO heterojunctions as
   revealed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, glancing angle
   X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman analyses.
   Used as a photoanode to photoelectrochemically split water, the TiO2/ZnO
   heterojunction sputtered for 53 min showed an almost 80\% increase in
   the photoconversion efficiency (7.3\%) compared to that of pure TiO2 NTs
   (4.1\%) under light illumination (320-400 nm, 100 mW/cm(2), 0.5 M
   Na2SO4). This was confirmed via the incident photon conversion
   efficiency (IPCE) measurements, which showed an enhancement in the
   charge carriers' collection efficiency in the heterojunction electrodes
   compared to pure titania nanotube films. The decrease in the band gap
   (3.06 eV), the high surface area, and the difference in the band
   positions between ZnO and TiO2 are thought to be the main reasons for
   the observed enhancement in the photoactivity.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to extract cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)
   from dry softwood pulp through a simple and environmentally friendly
   physical method of refining pretreatment coupled with high shear
   homogenization. An optical microscopy (OM) clearly showed the
   morphological development from the cellulose fibers to CNFs under
   repeated shear forces. The morphology, structure and properties of the
   obtained CNFs were comprehensively investigated using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier
   transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results indicated that the CNFs had
   diameters mainly ranged from 16 to 28 nm. Compared with the pulp fibers,
   the CNFs exhibited a slightly higher crystallinity and a lower thermal
   stability. Moreover, a novel nanopaper with high optical transparency
   was prepared from the obtained CNFs, and a possible mechanism for the
   high optical transparency was discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An abiotic formation of meso- and DL-tartrates in 80\% yield via the
   cyanide-catalyzed dimerization of glyoxylate under alkaline conditions
   is demonstrated. A detailed mechanism for this conversion is proposed,
   supported by NMR evidence and C-13-labeled reactions. Simple dehydration
   of tartrates to oxaloacetate and an ensuing decarboxylation to form
   pyruvate are known processes that provide a ready feedstock for entry
   into the citric acid cycle. While glyoxylate and high hydroxide
   concentration are atypical in the prebiotic literature, there is
   evidence for natural, abiotic availability of each. It is proposed that
   this availability, coupled with the remarkable efficiency of tartrate
   production from glyoxylate, merits consideration of an alternative
   prebiotic pathway for providing constituents of the citric acid cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Capturing CO2 from flue gas streams under near ambient conditions-e.g.
   coal-fired power plants-has traditionally involved the use of aqueous
   alkanol amine solutions. Aqueous solvent-based processes are energy
   intensive, as solvent regeneration can be costly. With growing concern
   over climate change, alternative CO2 capture technologies that are
   energy and cost efficient are required. We have established that
   nonaqueous silylamines can be used to efficiently and reversibly capture
   and release CO2 via the formation of reversible ionic liquids. We now
   report their unique, enhanced CO2 uptake at room temperature under 1 atm
   of CO2, as silylamines exhibit CO2 capture capacities greater than that
   expected from the conventional stoichiometry of a 2:1 amine to CO2 mole
   ratio. Experimental evidence is presented supporting the formation of a
   carbamic acid species in equilibrium with an ionic liquid network of
   ammonium-carbamate ion pairs to give a 3:2 amine to CO2 mole ratio. This
   is the first report of the stabilization of carbamic acid by reversible
   ionic liquids. Stabilization of carbamic acid leads to a significant
   increase in CO2 capacity (30\% on average) over conventional amine
   solutions for CO2 capture.}},

Title = {{Characterization of mRNA-Cytoskeleton Interactions In Situ Using FMTRIP
   and Proximity Ligation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Many studies have demonstrated an association between the cytoskeleton
   and mRNA, as well as the asymmetric distribution of mRNA granules within
   the cell in response to various signaling events. It is likely that the
   extensive cytoskeletal network directs mRNA transport and localization,
   with different cytoskeletal elements having their own specific roles. In
   order to understand the spatiotemporal changes in the interactions
   between the mRNA and the cytoskeleton as a response to a stimulus, a
   technique that can visualize and quantify these changes across a
   population of cells while capturing cell-to-cell variations is required.
   Here, we demonstrate a method for imaging and quantifying
   mRNA-cytoskeleton interactions on a per cell basis with
   single-interaction sensitivity. Using a proximity ligation assay with
   flag-tagged multiply-labeled tetravalent RNA imaging probes (FMTRIP), we
   quantified interactions between mRNAs and beta-tubulin, vimentin, or
   filamentous actin (F-actin) for two different mRNAs, poly(A) + and
   beta-actin mRNA, in two different cell types, A549 cells and human
   dermal fibroblasts (HDF). We found that the mRNAs interacted
   predominantly with F-actin (>50\% in HDF, >20\% in A549 cells), compared
   to beta-tubulin (< 5\%) and vimentin (11-13\%). This likely reflects
   differences in mRNA management by the two cell types. We then quantified
   changes in these interactions in response to two perturbations, F-actin
   depolymerization and arsenite-induced oxidative stress, both of which
   alter either the cytoskeleton itself and mRNA localization. Both
   perturbations led to a decrease in poly(A) + mRNA interactions with
   F-actin and an increase in the interactions with microtubules, in a time
   dependent manner.}},

Abstract = {{A series of cross-linkable membrane materials based on the 6FDA-DAM:DABA
   (3:2) polyimide backbone were synthesized for improved sour gas
   separation performance, in terms of both membrane stability and
   permselectivity. Short-chain poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules were
   used as cross-linking agents in an esterification-based cross-linking
   reaction. Pure and mixed gas permeation and pure gas sorption
   experiments were performed on dense films of these materials. Compared
   to unmodified 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2), higher sour gas permselectivity, and
   membrane stability were achieved under aggressive feed conditions.
   H2S-induced plasticization was not evident until pure H2S feed pressures
   greater than approximately 6-8 bar. Pure CO2-induced plasticization only
   occurred at feed pressures greater than about 25 bar. Under mixed gas
   feed conditions with 20\% H2S, 20\% CO2, and 60\% CH4 at 35 degrees C,
   attractive selectivities above 22 and 27 for H2S/CH4 and CO2/CH4,

Abstract = {{Much progress has been made in the development of novel visible light
   photocatalysts that split water into hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2). In
   this study, we examine the impact of initial solution pH on H-2

   visible light irradiation. In addition, the reaction mechanism was
   analyzed by examining the oxidation products of the electron donor (I-)
   at different solution pH values. The results show that the initial pH
   significantly influenced the rate of H-2 production and quantum yield
   (QY). In particular, the photocatalyst yielded the highest apparent QY
   (similar to 12.8\%) at 420 +/- 5 nm and highest H-2 production rate
   (similar to 525 mu mol h(-1)) at pH 2; with increasing pH, the H-2
   production and QY decreased significantly. The oxidation product of I-
   at pH <6 was mainly I-3(-), whereas at pH >6 water splitting did not
   occur at all, so no IO3- or I-2 were observed. Copyright (C) 2013,

Abstract = {{An assembly strategy is reported such that segmented nanorods fabricated
   through template-assisted methods can be robustly transferred and
   tethered to a pre-functionalized substrate with excellent uniformity
   over large surface areas. After embedding the rods, sacrificial nickel
   segments were selectively etched leaving behind strongly coupled
   segmented gold nanorods with gaps between rods below 40 nm and as small
   as 2 nm. Hyper-spectral imaging is utilized to measure Rayleigh
   scattering spectra from individual and coupled nanorod elements in
   contrast to common bulk measurements. This approach discerns the effects
   of not only changing segment and gap size but also the presence of
   characteristic defects on the plasmonic coupling between closely spaced
   nanorods. Polarized hyper-spectral measurements are conducted to provide
   direct observation of the anisotropic plasmonic resonance modes in
   individual and coupled nanorods, which are close to those predicted by
   computer simulations for nanorods with ideal shapes. Some common
   deviations from ideal shape such as non-flat facets and asymmetric tails
   are demonstrated to result in the appearance of characteristic plasmon
   resonances, which have not been considered before. The large-scale
   assembly of coupled noble nanostructures with fine control over geometry
   and high uniformity provides means to strongly tune the scattering,
   absorption, and near-field plasmonic properties through the geometric
   arrangement of precisely controlled nanorod segments.}},

Volume = {{247}},

Abstract = {{A growing interest in sensory system plasticity in the natural context
   of motherhood has created the need to investigate how intrinsic
   physiological state (e.g., hormonal, motivational, etc.) interacts with
   sensory experience to drive adaptive cortical plasticity for
   behaviorally relevant stimuli. Using a maternal mouse model of auditory
   cortical inhibitory plasticity for ultrasonic pup calls, we examined the
   role of pup care versus maternal physiological state in the long-term
   retention of this plasticity. Very recent experience caring for pups by
   Early Cocarers, which are virgins, produced stronger call-evoked
   lateral-band inhibition in auditory cortex. However, this plasticity was
   absent when measured post-weaning in Cocarers, even though it was
   present at the same time point in Mothers, whose pup experience occurred
   under a maternal physiological state. A two-alternative choice
   phonotaxis task revealed that the same animal groups (Early Cocarers and
   Mothers) demonstrating stronger lateral-band inhibition also preferred
   pup calls over a neutral sound, a correlation consistent with the
   hypothesis that this inhibitory mechanism may play a mnemonic role and
   is engaged to process sounds that are particularly salient. Our
   electrophysiological data hint at a possible mechanism through which the
   maternal physiological state may act to preserve the cortical
   plasticity: selectively suppressing detrimental spontaneous activity in
   neurons that are responsive to calls, an effect observed only in
   Mothers. Taken together, the maternal physiological state during the
   care of pups may help maintain the memory trace of behaviorally salient
   infant cues within core auditory cortex, potentially ensuring a more
   rapid induction of future maternal behavior. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by

Abstract = {{The kinin-B2 receptor (B2BKR) activated by its endogenous ligand
   bradykinin participates in various metabolic processes including the
   control of arterial pressure and inflammation. Recently, functions for
   this receptor in brain development and protection against
   glutamate-provoked excitotoxicity have been proposed. Here, we report
   neuroprotective properties for bradykinin against organophosphate
   poisoning using acute hippocampal slices as an in vitro model. Following
   slice perfusion for 10 min with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to
   initiate the noxious stimulus, responses of pyramidal neurons upon an
   electric impulse were reduced to less than 30\% of control amplitudes.
   Effects on synaptic-elicited population spikes were reverted when
   preparations had been exposed to bradykinin 30 min after challenging
   with DFP. Accordingly, bradykinin-induced population spike recovery was
   abolished by HOE-140, a B2BKR antagonist. However, the kinin-B1 receptor
   (B1BKR) agonist Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, inducing the phosphorylation
   of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK) and cell death, abolished
   bradykinin-mediated neuroprotection, an effect, which was reverted by
   the ERK inhibitor PD98059. In agreement with pivotal B1BKR functions in
   this process, antagonism of endogenous B1BKR activity alone was enough
   for restoring population spike activity. On the other hand pralidoxime,
   an oxime, reactivating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) after organophosphate
   poisoning, induced population spike recovery after DFP exposure in the
   presence of bradykinin and Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin.
   Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin did not revert protection exerted by
   pralidoxime, however when instead bradykinin and
   Ly-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin were superfused together, recovery of
   population spikes diminished. These findings again confirm the
   neuroprotective feature of bradykinin, which is, diminished by its
   endogenous metabolites, stimulating the B1BKR, providing a novel
   understanding of the physiological roles of these receptors. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Megakaryocytes generate platelets through extensive reorganization of
   the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. Cdc42 interacting protein 4 (CIP4)
   is an F-BAR protein that localizes to membrane phospholipids through its
   BAR domain and interacts with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP)
   via its SRC homology 3 domain. F-BAR proteins promote actin
   polymerization and membrane tubulation. To study its function, we
   generated CIP4-null mice that displayed thrombocytopenia similar to that
   of WAS(-) mice. The number of megakaryocytes and their progenitors was
   not affected. However, the number of proplatelet protrusions was reduced
   in CIP4-null, but not WAS(-), megakaryocytes. Electron micrographs of
   CIP4-null megakaryocytes showed an altered demarcation membrane system.
   Silencing of CIP4, not WASP, expression resulted in fewer
   proplatelet-like extensions. Fluorescence anisotropy studies showed that
   loss of CIP4 resulted in a more rigid membrane. Micropipette aspiration
   demonstrated decreased cortical actin tension in megakaryocytic cells
   with reduced CIP4 or WASP protein. These studies support a new
   biophysical mechanism for platelet biogenesis whereby CIP4 enhances the
   complex, dynamic reorganization of the plasma membrane (WASP
   independent) and actin cortex network (as known for WASP and cortical
   actin) to reduce the work required for generating proplatelets. CIP4 is
   a new component in the highly coordinated system of megakaryocytic
   membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling affecting platelet production.}},

Abstract = {{Optically cured polymers play a crucial role in many commercial
   applications, ranging from UV-cured inks, coatings, and dental fillings
   to the optical fabrication of three-dimensional prototypes by means of
   stereolithography. However, our understanding of the detailed processes
   that occur in the curing of these materials is often limited by the
   practical difficulty of observing the cure process in real time, under
   real-world conditions. This article reports the simple implementation of
   a free-space Mach-Zehnder interferometer that can be constructed
   inexpensively from readily available components, and demonstrates its
   utility in monitoring the UV curing of a typical acrylate photopolymer
   system in real time. In particular, it is shown that this system can
   sensitively track the induction period, the light-induced
   photopolymerization reaction, and the subsequent dark reaction that
   continues after the irradiation has been halted. This Interferometric
   Cure Monitor, or ICM, thus provides a valuable addition to other
   analytical methods, both for improving the quality control of existing
   commercial processes and for aiding the development of improved
   photopolymer formulations. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Abstract = {{The effect of benzalkonium chlorides (BACs), a widely used class of
   quaternary ammonium disinfectants, on microbial community structure and
   antimicrobial resistance was investigated using three aerobic microbial
   communities: BACs-unexposed (DP, fed a mixture of dextrin/peptone),
   BACs-exposed (DPB, fed a mixture of dextrin/peptone and BACs), and
   BACs-enriched (B, fed only BACs). Long-term exposure to BACs reduced
   community diversity and resulted in the enrichment of BAC-resistant
   species, predominantly Pseudomonas species. Exposure of the two
   microbial communities to BACs significantly decreased their
   susceptibility to BACs as well as three clinically relevant antibiotics
   (penicillin G, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin). Increased resistance to
   BACs and penicillin G of the two BACs-exposed communities is
   predominantly attributed to degradation or transformation of these
   compounds, whereas resistance to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin is
   largely due to the activity of efflux pumps. Quantification of several
   key multidrug resistance genes showed a much higher number of copies of
   these genes in the DPB and B microbial communities compared to the DP
   community. Collectively, our findings indicate that exposure of a
   microbial community to BACs results in increased antibiotic resistance,
   which has important implications for both human and environmental
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Source apportionment of particulate matter has been commonly performed
   using receptor models, but studies suggest that the assumptions in
   receptor models limit the accuracy of results. An alternative approach
   is the use of three-dimensional source-oriented air quality models.
   Here, a comparison is conducted between the PM2.5 apportioned from the
   Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) receptor model using organic tracers as
   molecular markers with those from the source-based Community Multiscale
   Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Source apportionment was conducted at sites in
   the southeastern United States for July 2001 and January 2002. PM2.5
   source apportionment results had moderate discrepancies, which originate
   from different spatial scales, fundamental limitations, and
   uncertainties of the two models. Results from CMB fluctuated temporally
   more than real variation due to measurement and source profile errors
   and uncertainties, whereas those from CMAQ could not capture daily
   variation well. In addition, results from CMB are mass contributions for
   the monitoring location, whereas those from CMAQ represent the average
   mass contributions of the model's grid. It is difficult to assess which
   approach is better. Indeed, both models have strengths and limitations,
   and each model's strengths can be utilized to help overcome the other
   model's limitations.}},

Abstract = {{In today's atmosphere of constrained defense spending and reduced
   research budgets, determining how to allocate resources for research and
   design has become a critical and challenging task. In the area of
   aircraft design, there are many promising technologies to be explored,
   yet limited funds with which to explore them. In addition, issues
   concerning the uncertainty in technology readiness, as well as the
   quantification of the impact of a technology (or combinations of
   technologies), are of key importance during the design process. This
   paper presents a methodology that details a comprehensive and structured
   process in which to quantitatively explore the effects of technology for
   a given baseline aircraft. This process, called technology impact
   forecasting, involves the creation of an assessment environment for use
   in conjunction with defined technology scenarios, and it will have a
   significant impact on the resource allocation strategies for defense
   acquisition. The advantages and limitations of the method are discussed.
   In addition, an example of a technology impact forecasting application,
   an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle, is presented and serves to
   illustrate the applicability of this methodology to a military system.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of glide slope control to guided airdrop systems has the
   potential to provide dramatic improvements in landing accuracy. Dynamic
   rigging incidence control has been demonstrated in flight tests and
   shown to provide effective glide slope control. The current work
   presents flight-test results exploring the range of glide slope control
   that can be achieved with high-performance parafoil canopies of two
   different aspect ratios. The low- and medium-aspect-ratio canopies have
   peak glide ratios of 4.4 and 4.9, respectively. By varying the incidence
   angle in flight, the glide slope can be reduced from these peak values
   to a glide slope near two for both canopies. Flight tests investigating
   the relationship between symmetric brake and incidence control
   demonstrate that symmetric braking produces effective airspeed control
   with little effect on glide slope, the incidence angle produces
   significant effects on both glide slope and airspeed, the rapid
   variation of the incidence angle in flight can lead to significant long
   period oscillations in both glide slope and airspeed, and the coupled
   effect of the control mechanisms of incidence angle and symmetric brake
   can produce dramatic changes in glide slope in any wind condition.}},

   Framework}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1564-1575}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new framework for performing early technology tradeoff
   and design studies, the relational-oriented systems engineering and
   technology tradeoff analysis framework, is developed and applied to an
   initial case study to conduct a trade between two candidate technologies
   for potential application on a commercial jet. Relational-oriented
   systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis leverages the
   relational-oriented systems engineering methodology coupled with the
   exploitation of transformations used in modeling and simulation to
   create a direct association between the quality function deployment
   methodology and standard quantitative conceptual design space
   exploration techniques leveraged in technology forecasting and trade
   studies. This association brings precision to quality function
   deployment that is model driven and mathematically founded. The approach
   highlights key deficiencies in quality function deployment when applied
   to early phase design and technology tradeoff studies for the
   development of systems. Relational-oriented systems engineering and
   technology tradeoff analysis proposes a more rigorous and generalized
   mathematical framework for conducting generic
   quality-function-deployment-type exercises to support decision-making in
   early systems engineering and design, and the advantages of the
   relational-oriented systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis
   framework are demonstrated through the application of
   relational-oriented systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis
   to a small-scale aerospace technology tradeoff. Relational-oriented
   systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis provides a means to
   begin to formalize and strengthen the relationship between quality
   function deployment, modeling and simulation, and theoretical
   mathematics, and it allows translation between these three approaches to
   engineering problems.}},

Abstract = {{Supersonic retropropulsion, or the initiation of a retropropulsion phase
   at supersonic freestream conditions, is an enabling decelerator
   technology for high-mass planetary entries at Mars. Supersonic
   retropropulsion relies on retrothrust to decelerate the vehicle. A
   thrust-driven interaction of underexpanded jet flow with the shock layer
   of a blunt body alters the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle.
   Little literature exists on analytical and computational modeling
   approaches for supersonic aerodynamic-propulsive interactions at
   moderate thrust levels and flight-relevant conditions. This
   investigation is an exploratory application of a steady, turbulent
   computational approach to supersonic retropropulsion flowfields using
   modern and historical test cases. The results obtained from this
   approach agree reasonably well with experimental data for the locations
   of the bow shock, stagnation point, and Mach disk for a retropropulsion
   configuration with a single nozzle at the nose. The surface pressure
   distributions agree less favorably, showing a pressure rise toward the
   shoulder that was not observed in the original experiment. The flowfield
   structures for a peripheral retropropulsion configuration agree
   qualitatively with the expected structures, but proper inboard jet flow
   expansion and interactions between individual jet flows are likely not
   being captured; accordingly, pressure is preserved inboard of the
   nozzles to higher thrust than was observed experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Systems analysis efforts have identified supersonic retropropulsion as a
   candidate decelerator technology for human exploration at Mars. These
   efforts are presently challenged by a lack of available models,
   including computational fluid dynamics analyses for databases
   representing the aerodynamic-propulsive interactions inherent to
   supersonic retropropulsion. This work presents an unsteady
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes approach to predict the flowfield
   structure, surface pressure distributions, and integrated aerodynamic
   force coefficients for four configurations recently tested in the NASA
   Langley Research Center Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel. These configurations
   have zero, one, three, and four nozzles on the forebody. Comparisons
   were made with experimental data for pressure distributions on the
   forebody and aftbody, and computational schlieren images illustrating
   the resulting flowfields were also generated. The results of this work
   illustrate the applicability of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
   equations to this problem through comparison with data from a test
   series designed explicitly for the validation of computational fluid
   dynamics tools in simulating supersonic retropropulsion flowfields. The
   approach performed well in predicting the surface pressure distribution
   and flowfield structure for supersonic retropropulsion configurations
   with different numbers of nozzles at angles of attack of 0 and 8 deg and

Abstract = {{Current Mars entry, descent, and landing technology is near its
   performance limit and may be unable to land payloads on the surface that
   exceed 1 metric ton. One option for increasing landed payload mass
   capability is decreasing the entry vehicle's hypersonic ballistic
   coefficient. A lower ballistic coefficient vehicle decelerates higher in
   the atmosphere, providing the additional timeline and altitude margin
   necessary to land more massive payloads. This study analyzed the guided
   entry performance of several low ballistic coefficient vehicle concepts
   on Mars. A terminal point controller guidance algorithm, based on the
   Apollo Final Phase algorithm, was used to provide precision targeting
   capability. Terminal accuracy, peak deceleration, peak heat rate, and
   integrated heat load were assessed and compared with a traditional Mars
   entry vehicle concept to determine the effects of lowering the vehicle
   ballistic coefficient on entry performance. Results indicate that, while
   terminal accuracy degrades slightly with decreasing ballistic
   coefficient, terminal accuracy rivals the performance of current entry
   systems for ballistic coefficients as low as 1 kg/m(2). These results
   demonstrate that guided entry vehicles with low ballistic coefficients
   (large diameters) may be feasible on Mars. Additionally, the flight
   performance determined by this investigation may be improved through the
   use of new guidance schemes designed specifically for low ballistic
   coefficient vehicles, as well as novel terminal descent systems designed
   around low ballistic coefficient trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Small-strain elastic wave propagation is a constant-fabric phenomenon
   ideally suited to monitor processes in soils. However, the determination
   of very small changes in travel time limits our ability to resolve
   changes in soil stiffness caused by internal processes or changes in
   boundary conditions. The first-arrival reflects the fastest path between
   the source and receiver of the propagating wave field; later arrivals in
   the coda correspond to longer paths after multiple boundary reflections
   and internal scattering. Therefore, time shifts between the codas of two
   consecutive signals are longer and easier to detect than between the
   signals' first arrivals. Slight changes in coda waves can be determined
   by cross-correlating time windows, time-stretched signals, or
   frequency-stretched spectra. Basic coda analysis assumes a homogeneous
   velocity change throughout the medium, propagation modes (P, S) that are
   equally affected by the process and the preservation of V-P/V-S ratio
   during the process. The resolving power of coda wave interferometry is
   explored in an experimental study conducted with quartzitic sand
   subjected to loading, creep, and unloading stages. The results reveal
   that coda wave analysis can be used to detect changes in wave velocity
   on the order of Delta V/V < 0.1\% (this corresponds to a stress change
   smaller than Delta sigma'/sigma' approximate to 1\% in uncemented
   soils). Such a high velocity resolution permits the study of creep,
   aging, and diagenetic processes even in relatively short duration tests.

Abstract = {{We report an innovative, large-area, and self-powered pressure mapping
   approach based on the triboelectric effect, which converts the
   mechanical stimuli into electrical output signals. The working mechanism
   of the triboelectric active sensor (TEAS) was theoretically studied by
   both analytical method and numerical calculation to gain an intuitive
   understanding of the relationship between the applied pressure and the
   responsive signals. Relying on the unique pressure response
   characteristics of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current,
   we realize both static and dynamic pressure sensing on a single device
   for the first time. A series of comprehensive investigations were
   carried out to characterize the performance of the TEAS, and high
   sensitivity (0.31 kPa(-1)), ultrafast response time (<5 ms), long-term
   stability (30 000 cycles), as well as low detection limit (21 Pa) were
   achieved. The pressure measurement range of the TEAS was adjustable,
   which means both gentle pressure detection and large-scale pressure
   sensing were enabled. Through integrating multiple TEAS units into a
   sensor array, the as-fabricated TEAS matrix was capable of monitoring
   and mapping the local pressure distribution applied on the device with
   distinguishable spatial profiles. This work presents a technique for
   tactile imaging and progress toward practical applications of
   nanogenerators, providing potential solutions for accomplishment of
   artificial skin, human-electronic interfacing, and self-powered systems.}},

Abstract = {{There is an unresolved debate in the scientific community about the
   shape of the quasistatic displacement pulse produced by nonlinear
   acoustic wave propagation in an elastic solid with quadratic
   nonlinearity. Early analytical and experimental studies suggested that
   the quasistatic pulse exhibits a right-triangular shape with the peak
   displacement of the leading edge being proportional to the length of the
   tone burst. In contrast, more recent theoretical, analytical, numerical,
   and experimental studies suggested that the quasistatic displacement
   pulse has a flat-top shape where the peak displacement is proportional
   to the propagation distance. This study presents rigorous mathematical
   analyses and numerical simulations of the quasistatic displacement
   pulse. In the case of semi-infinite solids, it is confirmed that the
   time-domain shape of the quasistatic pulse generated by a longitudinal
   plane wave is not a right-angle triangle. In the case of finite-size
   solids, the finite axial dimension of the specimen cannot simply be
   modeled with a linear reflection coefficient that neglects the nonlinear
   interaction between the combined incident and reflected fields. More
   profoundly, the quasistatic pulse generated by a transducer of finite
   aperture suffers more severe divergence than both the fundamental and
   second order harmonic pulses generated by the same transducer. (C) 2013

   comparing the results with those obtained using a direct numerical
   simulation. The first-order statistics do not show any significant
   differences for different blending functions, but the second-order
   statistics show some minor differences. The dynamic evaluation of the
   hybrid region and the blending function is necessary for non-equilibrium
   and complex flows where use of a static blending function can lead to
   inaccurate results. We propose two criteria for the dynamic evaluation;
   first evaluates extent of the hybrid region based on the subgrid
   turbulent kinetic energy and the second estimates the blending function
   based on a characteristic length scale. The computational efficiency of
   the method is enhanced by incorporating a hybrid programming paradigm
   where a standard domain decomposition by the message-passing-interface
   library is combined with the open multi-processing based
   parallelisation. A further enhancement of the method is achieved by
   incorporating a closure model for the unclosed hybrid terms in the
   governing equations, which appear due to hybridisation of two-level- and
   large-eddy-simulation methods. The model is based on an order of
   magnitude approximation and a preliminary assessment of the model shows
   improvement of turbulence statistics when used to simulate turbulent
   flow in a periodic channel. The assessment and improvements to the
   multi-scale method make it more suitable for simulation of practical
   wall-bounded turbulent flows at higher Reynolds number than a
   conventional large-eddy simulation. This is demonstrated by simulating
   two representative cases; turbulent flow at high Reynolds number in a
   periodic channel and flow over a bump placed on the lower surface of a
   channel, where a relatively coarser computational grid is found to be
   sufficient for reasonably accurate results.}},

Abstract = {{Sintering is an important step in densification of materials. Surfaces
   play a critical role in sintering, which are magnified for nano-systems
   (nanowire or nanoparticle). This work focuses on the investigation of
   the initial stages of nanoparticle sintering by atomistic simulation
   methods. We have characterized two different distinct systems, Argon
   clusters and mixed oxide systems, for analysis. Due to better
   particulate mixing, a combination of nanowire and nanoparticle was
   easier to sinter than a combination of nanoparticle and nanoparticle for
   Argon clusters. For a mixed oxide system (rutile-TiO2 and MgO), our
   results indicate that size, dimensions and structural stability of oxide
   nano-structures play an important role during sintering. For TiO2
   nanowire and MgO nanoparticle system, Ti atoms diffuse faster than Mg
   atoms, while for TiO2 nanosphere and MgO nanoparticle combination, Mg
   atoms diffuse faster than Ti atoms during sintering. This diffusion is
   guided by the relative size and cohesive energies of the nano-systems.

Abstract = {{Nanogenerator (MG) plays an important role in harvesting energy from the
   ambient environment. Here, we have developed a two dimensional woven
   nanogenerator (WNG), which imitates the textile's woven structure and is
   composed of two kinds of fibers crossing with each other, one kind of
   fibers grown with ZnO nanowires (NWs) and the other kind of fibers
   covered with the ZnO NWs coated with palladium (Pd) on their surface.
   Depending on the coupled piezoelectric and semiconducting properties of
   ZnO, it can generate electricity driven by the external tiny mechanical
   force such as tiny wind, sounds. The open-circuit voltage and
   short-circuit current of the WNG were 3 mV and 17 pA, respectively.
   Furthermore, the WNG was successfully used to power a microfiber/ZnO NWs
   hybrid UV sensor to form a wearable self-powered system, which can
   quantitatively detect the intensity of UV light. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We report a simple fabrication, great performance and cost-effective
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which is based on the cycled
   contact-separation between a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film and a
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, for effectively harvesting
   footfall energy. The elastic sponge is first used as the spacer in the
   TENG, where the size and the thickness of the spacers have a significant
   effect on the output performance of the TENG. By using the optimized
   device, a TENG-based shoe insole is used to harvest human walking
   energy, where the maximum output voltage and current density reached up
   to 220 V and 40 mu A, respectively. We also demonstrate that the
   fabricated shoe insole using a single layer of TENG can be directly used
   to light up 30 white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in serial connection.
   By taking the merits of this simple fabrication, outstanding
   performance, robust characteristic and low-cost technology, we believe
   that TENG can open up great opportunities not only for powering small
   electronics, but also can contribute to large-scale energy harvesting

Abstract = {{We present the results of new laboratory experiments that provide
   constraints on inter bubble film thinning and bubble coalescence as a
   consequence of liquid expulsion by gravitational and capillary forces.
   To ensure dynamic similarity to magmatic systems, the experiments are at
   small Reynolds numbers (Re<<1) and cover a wide range of Bond numbers
   (10(-3)Bo10(2)). Results indicate that at Bo<0.25 film drainage is due
   to capillary forces, whereas at Bo>0.25 gravitational forces result in
   film thinning. The film drainage time scale is given by t approximate to
   C ln () and is orders of magnitude faster than often assumed for
   magmatic systems. Here, C approximate to 10 is an empirical constant and
   is the ratio of initial film thickness to film thickness at the time of
   rupture and is the characteristic capillary or buoyancy time scale at
   values of Bo<0.25 and Bo>0.25, respectively.}},

Title = {{Heat Transfer in Microchannels-2012 Status and Research Needs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer and fluid flow in microchannels have been topics of
   intense research in the past decade. A critical review of the current
   state of research is presented with a focus on the future research
   needs. After providing a brief introduction, the paper addresses six
   topics related to transport phenomena in microchannels: single-phase gas
   flow, enhancement in single-phase liquid flow and flow boiling, flow
   boiling instability, condensation, electronics cooling, and microscale
   heat exchangers. After reviewing the current status, future research
   directions are suggested. Concerning gas phase convective heat transfer
   in microchannels, the antagonist role played by the slip velocity and
   the temperature jump that appear at the wall are now clearly understood
   and quantified. It has also been demonstrated that the shear work due to
   the slipping fluid increases the effect of viscous heating on heat
   transfer. On the other hand, very few experiments support the
   theoretical models and a significant effort should be made in this
   direction, especially for measurement of temperature fields within the
   gas in microchannels, implementing promising recent techniques such as
   molecular tagging thermometry (MTT). The single-phase liquid flow in
   microchannels has been established to behave similar to the macroscale
   flows. The current need is in the area of further enhancing the
   performance. Progress on implementation of flow boiling in microchannels
   is facing challenges due to its lower heat transfer coefficients and
   critical heat flux (CHF) limits. An immediate need for breakthrough
   research related to these two areas is identified. Discussion about
   passive and active methods to suppress flow boiling instabilities is
   presented. Future research focus on instability research is suggested on
   developing active closed loop feedback control methods, extending
   current models to better predict and enable superior control of flow
   instabilities. Innovative high-speed visualization and measurement
   techniques have led to microchannel condensation now being studied as a
   unique process with its own governing influences. Further work is
   required to develop widely applicable flow regime maps that can address
   many fluid types and geometries. With this, condensation heat transfer
   models can progress from primarily annular flow based models with some
   adjustments using dimensionless parameters to those that can directly
   account for transport in intermittent and other flows, and the varying
   influences of tube shape, surface tension and fluid property differences
   over much larger ranges than currently possible. Electronics cooling
   continues to be the main driver for improving thermal transport
   processes in microchannels, while efforts are warranted to develop high
   performance heat exchangers with microscale passages. Specific areas
   related to enhancement, novel configurations, nanostructures and
   practical implementation are expected to be the research focus in the
   coming years.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral and directional control of thermal emission is critically
   important for applications such as space cooling and energy harvesting.
   The effect of magnetic polaritons (MPs) on spectral modulation has been
   analyzed in metallic grating structures with a dielectric spacer on a
   metallic film. It has been predicted that the spectral emission peaks
   exhibit omnidirectional characteristics when MPs are excited. The
   present work provides an experimental demonstration of coherent thermal
   emission from several microfabricated grating structures in the infrared
   region from room temperature to elevated temperatures. The emittance at
   elevated temperatures is directly measured using an emissometer, while
   the room-temperature emittance is indirectly obtained from the
   reflectance measurement. The rigorous coupled-wave analysis and an
   LC-circuit model are employed to elucidate the mechanisms of various
   resonant modes and their coupling effect, taking into consideration the
   temperature-dependent electron scattering rate of the metals.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Turbidity (T) is the most ubiquitous of surrogate technologies used to
   estimate suspended-sediment concentration (SSC). The effects of sediment
   size on turbidity are well documented; however, effects from changes in
   particle size distributions (PSD) are rarely evaluated. Hysteresis in
   relations of SSC-to-turbidity (SSC approximate to T) for single
   stormflow events was observed and quantified for a dataset of 195
   concurrent measurements of SSC, turbidity, discharge, velocity, and
   volumetric PSD collected during five stormflows in 2009-2010 on Yellow
   River at Gees Mill Road in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. Regressions of
   SSC-normalized turbidity (T/SSC) on concurrently measured PSD
   percentiles show an inverse, exponential influence of particle size on
   turbidity that is not constant across the size range of the PSD. The
   majority of the influence of PSD on T/SSC is from particles of fine silt
   and smaller sizes (finer than 16 mu m). This study shows that small
   changes in the often assumed stability of the PSD are significant to SSC
   approximate to T relations. Changes of only 5 mu m in the fine silt and
   smaller size fractions of suspended sediment PSD can produce hysteresis
   in the SSC approximate to T rating that can increase error and produce
   bias. Observed SSC approximate to T hysteresis may be an indicator of
   changes in sediment properties during stormflows and of potential
   changes in sediment sources. Trends in the PSD time series indicate that
   sediment transport is capacity limited for sand-sized sediment in the
   channel and supply limited for fine silt and smaller sediment from the
   hillslope.}},

   (nc-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been fabricated using low

   commonly observed in biological neurons such as millisecond spike
   duration, nonlinear frequency-current relationship, and spike frequency
   adaptation. The maximum drive capacity of a simple soma circuit was
   estimated to be approximately 9200 synapses. The effect of bias
   stress-induced threshold voltage degradation of component nc-Si TFTs on
   the spike frequency of soma circuits is explored. The measured power
   consumption of the circuit when spiking at 100 Hz was approximately 12
   nW. Finally, the power consumption of the soma circuits at different

Title = {{In Vitro Comparison of Doppler and Catheter-Measured Pressure Gradients
   in 3D Models of Mitral Valve Calcification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Mitral annular calcification (MAC) involves calcium deposition in the
   fibrous annulus supporting the mitral valve (MV). When calcification
   extends onto the leaflets, valve opening can be restricted. The
   influence of MAC MV geometry on Doppler gradients is unknown. This study
   describes a novel methodology to rapid-prototype subject-specific MAC
   MVs. Replicated valves were used to assess the effects of distorted
   annular-leaflet geometry on Doppler-derived, transmitral gradients in
   comparison to direct pressure measurements and to determine if
   transmitral gradients vary according to measurement location.
   Three-dimensional echocardiography data sets were selected for two MAC
   MVs and one healthy MV. These MVs were segmented and rapid prototyped in
   their middiastolic configuration for in vitro testing. The effects of MV
   geometry, measurement modality, and measurement location on transmitral
   pressure gradient were assessed by Doppler and catheter at three
   locations along the MV's intercommissural axis. When comparing
   dimensions of the rapid-prototyped valves to the subject
   echocardiography data sets, mean relative errors ranged from 6.2\% to
   35\%. For the evaluated MVs, Doppler pressure gradients exhibited good
   agreement with catheter-measured gradients at a variety of flow rates,
   though with slight systematic overestimation in the recreated MAC
   valves. For all of the tested MVs, measuring the transmitral pressure
   gradient at differing valve orifice positions had minimal impact on
   observed gradients. Upon the testing of additional normal and calcific
   MVs, these data may contribute to an improved clinical understanding of
   MAC-related mitral stenosis. Moreover, they provide the ability to
   statistically evaluate between measurement locations, flow rates, and
   valve geometries for Doppler-derived pressure gradients. Determining
   these end points will contribute to greater clinical understanding for
   the diagnosis MAC patients and understanding the use and application of
   Doppler echocardiography to estimate transmitral pressure gradients.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Programming-Informed Equivalent Cost Minimization Control
   Strategies for Hybrid-Electric Vehicles}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a direct mathematical approach for determining the
   state of charge (SOC)-dependent equivalent cost factor in
   hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) supervisory control problems using
   globally optimal dynamic programming (DP). It therefore provides a
   rational basis for designing equivalent cost minimization strategies
   (ECMS) which achieve near optimal fuel economy (FE). The suggested
   approach makes use of the Pareto optimality criterion that exists in
   both ECMS and DP, and as such predicts the optimal equivalence factor
   for a drive cycle using DP marginal cost. The equivalence factor is then
   further modified with corrections based on battery SOC, with the aim of
   making the equivalence factor robust to drive cycle variations. Adaptive
   logic is also implemented to ensure battery charge sustaining operation
   at the desired SOC. Simulations performed on parallel and power-split
   HEV architectures demonstrate the cross-platform applicability of the
   DP-informed ECMS approach. Fuel economy data resulting from the
   simulations demonstrate that the robust controller consistently achieves
   FE within 1\% of the global optimum prescribed by DP. Additionally, even
   when the equivalence factor deviates substantially from the optimal
   value for a drive cycle, the robust controller can still produce FE
   within 1-2\% of the global optimum. This compares favorably with a
   traditional ECMS controller based on a constant equivalence factor,
   which can produce FE 20-30\% less than the global optimum under the same
   conditions. As such, the controller approach detailed should result in
   ECMS supervisory controllers that can achieve near optimal FE
   performance, even if component parameters vary from assumed values (e.
   g., due to manufacturing variation, environmental effects or aging), or
   actual driving conditions deviate largely from standard drive cycles.}},

Title = {{Rack Level Modeling of Air Flow Through Perforated Tile in a Data Center}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Effective air flow distribution through perforated tiles is required to
   efficiently cool servers in a raised floor data center. We present
   detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of air flow through
   a perforated tile and its entrance to the adjacent server rack. The
   realistic geometrical details of the perforated tile, as well as of the
   rack are included in the model. Generally, models for air flow through
   perforated tiles specify a step pressure loss across the tile surface,
   or porous jump model based on the tile porosity. An improvement to this
   includes a momentum source specification above the tile to simulate the
   acceleration of the air flow through the pores, or body force model. In
   both of these models, geometrical details of tile such as pore locations
   and shapes are not included. More details increase the grid size as well
   as the computational time. However, the grid refinement can be
   controlled to achieve balance between the accuracy and computational
   time. We compared the results from CFD using geometrical resolution with
   the porous jump and body force model solution as well as with the
   measured flow field using particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments.
   We observe that including tile geometrical details gives better results
   as compared to elimination of tile geometrical details and specifying
   physical models across and above the tile surface. A modification to the
   body force model is also suggested and improved results were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Hotspots on a microelectronic package can severely hurt the performance
   and long-term reliability of the chip. Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) can
   provide site-specific and on-demand cooling of hot spots in
   microprocessors. We develop a 3D compact model for fast and accurate
   modeling of a TEC device integrated inside an electronic package. A 1D
   compact model of a TEC is first built in SPICE and validated for
   steady-state and transient behavior against a finite-volume model. The
   1D compact model of the TEC is then incorporated into a 3D compact model
   of a prototype electronic package. The results from the compact model
   for the packaged TEC are in good agreement with a finite-volume based
   model, which confirms the compact model's ability to accurately model
   the TEC's interaction with the package. Analysis of packaged TECs using
   this 3D compact model shows that (i) moving TECs closer to the chip
   results in faster response time and an increase in maximum cooling, (ii)
   high thermal contact resistance within the thermoelectric cooler
   significantly degrades performance of the device, and (iii) higher
   convective heat transfer coefficients (HTC) at the heat spreader surface
   increase steady-state cooling but decrease maximum transient cooling.}},

Abstract = {{Locomotor balance control mechanisms and impairments have been well
   described in the literature. In contrast, the role of evidence-based
   motor learning strategies in the recovery or restoration of locomotor
   balance control has received much less attention. Little is known about
   the efficacy of motor learning strategies to improve locomotor tasks and
   their unique requirements, such as lateral balance control. This study
   examined whether gradual versus sudden training influenced lateral
   balance control among unimpaired adults (n = 16) during training and
   24-h transfer performance of a novel locomotor task. This was
   accomplished by examining the variability of whole-body frontal plane
   kinematics throughout training and 24-h transfer performance of
   asymmetric split-belt treadmill walking. Compared to sudden training,
   gradual training significantly reduced the challenge to lateral balance
   control (exhibited by a reduction in frontal plane kinematic
   variability) during training and during subsequent transfer task
   performance. These results indicate that gradual training could play an
   important role in restoring locomotor balance control during physical
   rehabilitation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity consumption for plugged-in electric loads (PELs) accounts
   for more use than any other single end-use service in residential and
   commercial buildings. PELs possess potentials to be efficiently managed
   for many purposes. However, few existing load identification methods are
   designed for PELs to handle challenges such as the diversity within each
   type of PELs and similarity between different types of PELs with similar
   front-end power supply units. Existing methods provide only absolute
   decisions which are not reliable when handling these challenges. This
   paper presents a simple yet efficient and practical hybrid supervised
   self-organizing map (SSOM)/Bayesian identifier for PELs. The proposed
   identifier can classify PELs into clusters by inherent similarities due
   to similar front-end power supply topologies, extract and utilize
   statistical information, and provide the probability of the unknown load
   belonging to a specific type of load. Tests based on real-world data
   validate that the proposed methods are accurate, robust, and applicable.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of ocean temperature measurement systems is presented with
   a focus on the development and accuracy of two critical devices in use
   today (expendable bathythermographs and conductivity-temperature-depth
   instruments used on Argo floats). A detailed discussion of the accuracy
   of these devices and a projection of the future of ocean temperature
   measurements are provided. The accuracy of ocean temperature
   measurements is discussed in detail in the context of ocean heat
   content, Earth's energy imbalance, and thermosteric sea level rise.
   Up-to-date estimates are provided for these three important quantities.
   The total energy imbalance at the top of atmosphere is best assessed by
   taking an inventory of changes in energy storage. The main storage is in
   the ocean, the latest values of which are presented. Furthermore,
   despite differences in measurement methods and analysis techniques,
   multiple studies show that there has been a multidecadal increase in the
   heat content of both the upper and deep ocean regions, which reflects
   the impact of anthropogenic warming. With respect to sea level rise,
   mutually reinforcing information from tide gauges and radar altimetry
   shows that presently, sea level is rising at approximately 3mmyr(-1)
   with contributions from both thermal expansion and mass accumulation
   from ice melt. The latest data for thermal expansion sea level rise are
   included here and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic Induction (MI) techniques enable efficient wireless
   communications in dense media with high material absorptions, such as
   underground soil medium and oil reservoirs. A wide range of novel and
   important applications in such RF-challenged environments can be
   realized based on the MI communication mechanism. Despite the potential
   advantages, the major bottleneck of the MI communication is the limited
   channel capacity due to the low MI bandwidth. In this paper, the Spread
   Resonance (RS) strategy is developed for the MI communication in
   RF-challenged environments which greatly increases the MI channel
   capacity. Specifically, instead of using the same resonant frequency for
   all the MI coils, the spread resonance strategy allocates different
   resonant frequencies for different MI relay and transceiver coils. An
   optimization solution for the resonant frequency allocation is
   formulated to maximize the MI channel capacity which captures multiple
   unique MI effects, including the parasitic capacitor in each MI coil,
   the Eddy currents in various transmission media with limited
   conductivities, and the random direction of each coil. Numerical
   evaluations are provided to validate the significant channel capacity
   improvements by the proposed SR strategy for MI communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Cell seeding throughout the thickness of a nanofiber
   construct allows for patient-specific implant alternatives with
   long-lasting effects, earlier integration, and reduced inflammation when
   compared with traditional implants. Cell seeding may improve implant
   integration with host tissue; however, the effect of cell seeding on
   thick nanofiber constructs has not been studied.
   OBJECTIVE To use a novel cell-preseeded nanofiber tissue engineering
   technique to create a 3-dimensional biocompatible implant alternative to
   decellularized extracellular matrix.
   DESIGN Animal study with mammalian cell culture to study tissue
   engineered scaffolds.
   SETTING Academic research laboratory.
   PARTICIPANTS Thirty-six Sprague-Dawley rats.
   INTERVENTIONS The rats each received 4 implant types. The grafts
   included rat primary (enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive
   {[}eGFP+]) fibroblast-seeded polycaprolactone (PCL)/collagen nanofiber
   scaffold, PCL/collagen cell-free nanofiber scaffold, acellular human
   cadaveric dermis (AlloDerm), and acellular porcine dermis (ENDURAGen).
   Rats were monitored postoperatively and received enrofloxacin in the
   drinking water for 4 days prophylactically and buprenorphine (0.2-0.5
   mg/kg administered subcutaneously twice a day postoperatively for pain
   for 48 hours).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The viability of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts cultured
   on PCL electrospun nanofibers was evaluated using fluorescence
   microscopy. Soft-tissue remodeling was examined histologically and with
   novel ex vivo volume determinations of implants using micro-computed
   tomography of cell-seeded implants relative to nanofibers without cells
   and commonly used dermal grafts of porcine and human origin (ENDURAGen
   and AlloDerm, respectively). The fate and distribution of eGFP+ seeded
   donor fibroblasts were assessed using immunohistochemistry.
   RESULTS Fibroblasts migrated across nanofiber layers within 12 hours and
   remained viable on a single layer for up to 14 days. Scanning electron
   microscopy confirmed a nanoscale structure with a mean (SD) diameter of
   158 (72) nm. Low extrusion rates demonstrated the excellent
   biocompatibility in vivo. Histological examination of the scaffolds
   demonstrated minimal inflammation. Cell seeding encouraged rapid
   vascularization of the nanofiber implants. Cells of donor origin (eGFP+)
   declined with the duration of implantation. Implant volume was not
   significantly affected for up to 8 weeks by the preseeding of cells (P >
   .05).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Polymer nanofiber-based scaffolds mimic
   natural extracellular matrix. Preseeding the nanofiber construct with
   cells improved vascularization without notable effects on volume. An
   effect of cell preseeding on scaffold vascularization was evident beyond
   the presence of preseeded cells. This 3-dimensional, multilayer method
   of cell seeding throughout a 1-mm-thick construct is simple and feasible
   for clinical application. Further development of this technique may
   affect the clinical practice of facial plastic and reconstructive

Abstract = {{Surface wave methods exploit the dispersive properties of Rayleigh and
   Love waves to estimate the shear wave velocity profiles in vertically
   heterogeneous subsurfaces. Typically, they rely on a simplified
   one-dimensional (1D) analytical forward model where the lateral
   variation of the layer thickness is neglected and so is the fraction of
   the incident energy of the fundamental mode that is reflected or
   converted to higher modes. A theoretical study is presented that
   attempts to define an analytical model that overcomes the limitations of
   1D forward models. In particular, we revisit properties of
   semianalytical approaches that aim at solving the dynamics of Love waves
   in laterally heterogeneous media made of a soft upper layer of varying
   thickness lying over an infinitely deep hard layer. The novel analytical
   model stems from a local-mode expansion of waves with laterally varying
   amplitudes, which allows for both reflections of the incident modes and
   coupling to higher modes. The best wave approximation stems from an
   action principle that leads to a coupled system of second-order ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs) for the wave amplitudes. Last, an
   application of this model and its validity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Packet-based networks-on-chip (NoC) are considered among the most viable
   candidates for the on-chip interconnection network of many-core chips.
   Unrelenting increases in the number of processing elements on a single
   chip die necessitate a scalable and efficient communication fabric. The
   resulting enlargement of the on-chip network size has been accompanied
   by an equivalent widening of the physical inter-router channels.
   However, the growing link bandwidth is not fully utilized, because the
   packet size is not always a multiple of the channel width. While slicing
   of the physical channel enhances link utilization, it incurs additional
   delay, because the number of flit per packet also increases. This paper
   proposes a novel router micro-architecture that employs fine-grained
   bandwidth ``sharding{''} (i.e., partitioning) and stealing in order to
   mitigate the elevation in the zero-load latency caused by slicing.
   Consequently, the zero-load latency of the Sharded Router becomes
   identical with that of a conventional router, whereas its throughput is
   markedly improved by fully utilizing all available bandwidth. Detailed
   experiments using a full-system simulation framework indicate that the
   proposed router reduces the average network latency by up to 19\% and
   the execution time of real multi-threaded workloads by up to 43\%.
   Finally, hardware synthesis analysis verifies the modest area overhead
   of the Sharded Router over a conventional design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A fundamental aspect of designing systems with dedicated servers is
   identifying and improving the system bottlenecks. We extend the concept
   of a bottleneck to networks with heterogeneous, flexible servers. In
   contrast with a network with dedicated servers, the bottlenecks are not
   a priori obvious, but can be determined by solving a number of linear
   programming problems. Unlike the dedicated server case, we find that a
   bottleneck may span several nodes in the network. We then identify some
   characteristics of desirable flexibility structures. In particular, the
   chosen flexibility structure should not only achieve the maximal
   possible capacity (corresponding to full server flexibility), but should
   also have the feature that the entire network is the (unique) system
   bottleneck. The reason is that it is then possible to shift capacity
   between arbitrary nodes in the network, allowing the network to cope
   with demand fluctuations. Finally, we specify when certain flexibility
   structures (in particular chaining, targeted flexibility, and the N and
   W structures from the call center literature) possess these desirable
   characteristics.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{5966-5978}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure evolution during isothermal static annealing of
   magnesium alloy AZ31 was investigated to critically evaluate the
   contribution of extension and contraction twins to the recrystallized
   microstructure after room temperature deformation, and to establish the
   potential of these twins to alter the recrystallized texture.
   Contraction twins were observed to be potent sites for recrystallized
   nuclei having many favorable new orientations, while extension twins
   were not effective nucleation sites for recrystallization. Although
   recrystallization nucleated preferentially inside the contraction twins,
   producing a distribution of new orientations (far from the undesirable
   starting c-axis fiber texture), these new grains did not significantly
   influence the final texture. This was attributed to four factors: (1)
   unusually extensive recovery before the onset of recrystallization after
   c-axis compression in most grains; (2) incomplete recrystallization
   within grains most closely aligned with the starting fiber texture; (3)
   sluggish growth of grains nucleated in the compression twins; (4) grain
   boundaries becoming an active site for recrystallized nuclei with a
   majority containing orientations from the starting texture. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{To further investigate the effect of dilute acid pretreatment (DAP) and
   steam explosion pretreatment (SE) on the change in cellulose
   accessibility, several techniques were applied including a Simons' stain
   (SS) technique along with several NMR methods (i.e., NMR cryoporometry,
   H-1 spin-lattice (T-1) and H-1 spin-spin (T-2) relaxometry, and
   diffusometry). These methods were utilized to probe biomass porosity and
   thus assess cellulose accessibility on untreated and pretreated Populus.
   In general, these techniques indicate that pretreated Populus has larger
   pore size distributions and specific surface area (SSA) when compared to
   an untreated sample. The SS method revealed that DAP is more effective
   than SE in terms of the SSA increase, and that DAP increases SSA as a
   function of pretreatment severity. Relaxometry and diffusion
   measurements also suggest pore expansion occurs primarily in the first
   10 min of DAP. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter
   (SCCWM) is an experimental therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD).
   The specific axonal pathways that mediate the antidepressant effects of
   DBS remain unknown. Patient-specific tractography-activation models
   (TAMs) are a new tool to help identify pathways modulated by DBS. TAMs
   consist of four basic components: 1) anatomical and diffusion-weighted
   imaging data acquired on the patient; 2) probabilistic tractography from
   the brain region surrounding the implanted DBS electrode; 3) finite
   element models of the electric field generated by the patient-specific
   DBS parameter settings; and 4) application of the DBS electric field to
   multi-compartment cable models of axons, with trajectories defined by
   the tractography, to predict action potential generation in specific
   pathways. This study presents TAM predictions from DBS of the SCCWM in
   one MDD patient. Our findings suggest that small differences in
   electrode location can generate substantial differences in the directly
   activated pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of placement and size for multiple distributed generators
   based on renewable energies becomes an important issue in operating
   modern power systems safely and reliably. This paper extends the
   previous study in our earlier paper by treating the problems for their
   optimal locations and sizes in more realistic way based on the power
   loss sensitivities and Kalman filter algorithm, respectively. In
   particular, the proposed method is implemented by the simulation on a
   part of practical distribution network of 60 MVA scale, which is located
   at the Do-gok area in Seoul, Korea. The new factor, called as the
   optimal locator index, is developed to determine the optimal locations
   in a systematic and effective manner by the power loss sensitivities.
   Also, the Kalman filter algorithm is applied to determine the optimal
   sizes by choosing the step size of 10 KW, which is a much smaller
   increment than the 10-MW step used in our earlier paper, without
   requiring high computational efforts. This selected step size of 10 KW
   is realistic and suitable to apply in practical test systems.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 years, there have been a variety of experiments that
   have revealed a large increase in the low-frequency capacitance of
   devices constructed from metal-insulator nanocomposite materials. These
   capacitive increases are typically reported as dramatic increases in the
   effective relative dielectric constants of the nanocomposite materials.
   A class of these materials that operate at room temperature and have
   metal particle concentrations near the percolation threshold have been
   shown to have dramatic increases in the effective dielectric constant on
   the order of 10(4) - 10(10). The simulations in this paper reveal that
   electrical contact to large metal clusters inside the composite material
   near the percolation threshold form fractal-like electrodes that deeply
   penetrate into the host dielectric material, which result in an
   effective dielectric constant that is 10(4) - 10(5) times greater than
   the host dielectric. Furthermore, insulating the planar electrodes so
   that no electrical contact is made to the metallic clusters inside a
   near-percolation-threshold composite material reveals a much smaller
   increase (40x) in the effective dielectric constant. Finally, a new
   physical scaling model and a simple geometric model for capacitance
   estimation in metal-insulator composites are developed and used to
   enhance understanding of the physical effects behind the results of
   these numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulation of spin information in semiconductors has been the topic of
   both experimental and theoretical studies. In this paper, the
   theoretical compact models for the spin-relaxation length (SRL) in
   nondegenerately doped silicon and gallium arsenide are presented. These
   models account for the impact of impurity doping and phonons on
   mediating spin relaxation. In addition, the models are exhaustively
   calibrated with the published experimental data. It is shown that the
   SRL at room temperature in Si drops from 5 to 1 mu m as the doping
   increases from 10(14) to 10(19) cm(-3). However, the SRL in GaAs is
   independent of doping for nondegenerate doping levels. While the rolloff
   of the SRL with temperature in Si depends upon the doping concentration,
   the rolloff of the SRL for nondegenerately doped GaAs is doping
   independent and proceeds as T-1, where T is the operating temperature.
   The models of the SRL in conjunction with spin drift-diffusion equation
   are used to study the steady-state spin transport in both the
   conventional and nonlocal semiconducting spin-valve geometries. The
   presence of an electric field leads to a clear enhancement of spin
   injection and transport efficiency in the conventional spin-valve
   geometry. The degradation in the spin injection and transport efficiency
   with the channel length is much steeper in nonlocal spin valves as
   compared to that in the conventional spin valves.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1278-1290}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In both the upper and lower limbs, evidence suggests that short-latency
   electromyographic (EMG) responses to mechanical perturbations are
   modulated based on muscle stretch or joint motion, whereas long-latency
   responses are modulated based on attainment of task-level goals, e. g.,
   desired direction of limb movement. We hypothesized that long-latency
   responses are modulated continuously by task-level error feedback.
   Previously, we identified an error-based sensorimotor feedback
   transformation that describes the time course of EMG responses to
   ramp-and-hold perturbations during standing balance (Safavynia and Ting
   2013; Welch and Ting 2008, 2009). Here, our goals were 1) to test the
   robustness of the sensorimotor transformation over a richer set of
   perturbation conditions and postural states; and 2) to explicitly test
   whether the sensorimotor transformation is based on task-level vs.
   joint-level error. We developed novel perturbation trains of
   acceleration pulses such that perturbations were applied when the body
   deviated from the desired, upright state while recovering from preceding
   perturbations. The entire time course of EMG responses (similar to 4 s)
   in an antagonistic muscle pair was reconstructed using a weighted sum of
   center of mass (CoM) kinematics preceding EMGs at long-latency delays
   (similar to 100 ms). Furthermore, CoM and joint kinematic trajectories
   became decorrelated during perturbation trains, allowing us to
   explicitly compare task-level vs. joint feedback in the same
   experimental condition. Reconstruction of EMGs was poorer using joint
   kinematics compared with CoM kinematics and required un-physiologically
   short (similar to 10 ms) delays. Thus continuous, long-latency feedback
   of task-level variables may be a common mechanism regulating
   long-latency responses in the upper and lower limbs.}},

Abstract = {{Although cats that have been spinalized can also be trained to stand and
   step with full weight support, directionally appropriate long-latency
   responses to perturbations are impaired, suggesting that these behaviors
   are mediated by distinct neural mechanisms. However, it remains unclear
   whether these responses reflect an attenuated postural response using
   the appropriate muscular coordination patterns for balance or are due to
   fundamentally different neural mechanisms such as increased muscular
   cocontraction or short-latency stretch responses. Here we used muscle
   synergy analysis on previously collected data to identify whether there
   are changes in the spatial organization of muscle activity for balance
   within an animal after spinalization. We hypothesized that the modular
   organization of muscle activity for balance control is disrupted by
   spinal cord transection. In each of four animals, muscle synergies were
   extracted from postural muscle activity both before and after
   spinalization with nonnegative matrix factorization. Muscle synergy
   number was reduced after spinalization in three animals and increased in
   one animal. However, muscle synergy structure was greatly altered after
   spinalization with reduced direction tuning, suggesting little
   consistent organization of muscle activity. Furthermore, muscle synergy
   recruitment was correlated to subsequent force production in the intact
   but not spinalized condition. Our results demonstrate that the modular
   structure of sensorimotor feedback responses for balance control is
   severely disrupted after spinalization, suggesting that the muscle
   synergies for balance control are not accessible by spinal circuits
   alone. Moreover, we demonstrate that spinal mechanisms underlying weight
   support are distinct from brain stem mechanisms underlying directional
   balance control.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted for falling U-chain, but explicit
   analytic form of the general equations of motion was not presented.
   Several modeling methods were developed for fish robots, however they
   just focused on the whole fish's locomotion which does little favor to
   understand the detailed swimming behavior of fish. Udwadia-Kalaba theory
   is used to model these two multi-body systems and obtain explicit
   analytic equations of motion. For falling U-chain, the mass matrix is
   non-singular. Second-order constraints are used to get the constraint
   force and equations of motion and the numerical simulation is conducted.
   Simulation results show that the chain tip falls faster than the freely
   falling body. For fish robot, two-joint Carangiform fish robot is
   focused on. Quasi-steady wing theory is used to approximately calculate
   fluid lift force acting on the caudal fin. Based on the obtained
   explicit analytic equations of motion (the mass matrix is singular),
   propulsive characteristics of each part of the fish robot are obtained.
   Through these two cases of U chain and fish robot, how to use
   Udwadia-Kalaba equation to obtain the dynamical model is shown and the
   modeling methodology for multi-body systems is presented. It is also
   shown that Udwadia-Kalaba theory is applicable to systems whether or not

Abstract = {{Motivated by the need to study traffic incident management, we consider
   a Markovian infinite server queue that is subjected to randomly
   occurring shocks. These shocks affect the service of all servers to
   deteriorate, i.e., increase the service time of all servers, and might
   also cause other shocks, thus causing further service deterioration.
   There are a finite number of service levels, zero corresponding to the
   normal service with the highest service rate and the last level
   corresponding to the slowest service rate which could even be equal to
   zero, implying the complete service breakdown. The repair process is
   performed only at the last level. These types of queues also represent
   an approximation of multi-server call-centers with deteriorating
   service. We derive the mean and variance of the stationary number in the
   system, and show that the mean is convex with respect to the repair
   rate. Furthermore, we study the optimal repair rate that minimizes the
   expected long-run average cost incurred due to delay and repairs. We
   show that the expected total cost per unit time as a function of repair
   rate is unimodal. We derive conditions under which the cost function is
   in one of three simple forms, so that the optimum repair rate can easily
   be obtained. Furthermore, we prove that applying the maximum repair rate
   may not always be optimum. Numerical examples are also provided. (C)

Abstract = {{A scalable, low-cost process for fabricating copper-based microwave

   inkjet printer is used to deposit a catalyst-bearing solution (tailored
   for such printing) in a desired pattern on commercially-available,
   recyclable, non-toxic (TeslinA (R)) paper. The catalystbearing paper is
   then immersed in an aqueous copper-bearing solution to allow for
   electroless deposition of a compact and conformal layer of copper in the
   inkjet-derived pattern. Meander monopole antennas comprised of such
   electroless-deposited copper patterns on paper exhibited comparable
   performance as for antennas synthesized via inkjet printing of a
   commercially-available silver nanoparticle ink. However, the
   solution-based patterning and electroless copper deposition process
   avoids nozzle-clogging problems and costs associated with noble metal
   particle-based inks. This process yields compact conductive copper
   layers without appreciable oxidation and without the need for an
   elevated temperature, post-deposition thermal treatment commonly
   required for noble metal particle-based ink processes. This low-cost

Abstract = {{We present a cloud-based approach for the design of interoperable
   electronic health record (EHR) systems. Cloud computing environments
   provide several benefits to all the stakeholders in the healthcare
   ecosystem (patients, providers, payers, etc.). Lack of data

   the exchange of healthcare data between different stakeholders. We
   propose an EHR system-cloud health information systems technology
   architecture (CHISTAR) that achieves semantic interoperability through
   the use of a generic design methodology which uses a reference model
   that defines a general purpose set of data structures and an archetype
   model that defines the clinical data attributes. CHISTAR application
   components are designed using the cloud component model approach that
   comprises of loosely coupled components that communicate asynchronously.
   In this paper, we describe the high-level design of CHISTAR and the
   approaches for semantic interoperability, data integration, and

Abstract = {{One of the crucial factors for the thermomechanical reliability of
   electronic packages is warpage that occurs during the printed wiring
   board (PWB) fabrication, solder masking and solder reflow processes. As
   the quality and reliability requirements of electronic components
   (packages) become higher, warpage control becomes a more crucial process
   during the PWB fabrication (manufacturing) and package assembly
   processes. The warpage of PWBs, PWB assemblies and electronic packages
   are measured by various techniques. Each technique has both its
   advantages and disadvantages; therefore the choice of a particular
   technique depends on whether one wants to measure the warpage of a PWB,
   PWB assembly or chip package. This paper reviews the pros and cons, such
   as resolution, speed, costs, accuracy, in-line capability, flexibility,
   and robustness, of different techniques used for measuring the warpage

Abstract = {{Quantitative modeling and analysis of structural and functional brain
   networks based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data have received extensive interest recently.
   However, the regularity of these structural and functional brain

   different individuals is largely unknown. This paper presents a novel
   approach to inferring group-wise consistent brain subnetworks from
   multimodal DTI/resting-state fMRI datasets via multi-view spectral
   clustering of cortical networks, which were constructed upon our
   recently developed and validated large-scale cortical landmarks-DIC-CCOL
   (dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks).
   We applied the algorithms on DTI data of 100 healthy young females and
   50 healthy young males, obtained consistent multimodal brain networks
   within and across multiple groups, and further examined the functional
   roles of these networks. Our experimental results demonstrated that the
   derived brain networks have substantially improved inter-modality and
   inter-subject consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Robust motor behaviors emerge from neuromechanical interactions that are
   nonlinear, have delays, and contain redundant neural and biomechanical
   components. For example, in standing balance a subject's muscle activity
   (neural control) decreases as stance width (biomechanics) increases when
   responding to a lateral perturbation, yet the center-of-mass motion
   (behavior) is nearly identical regardless of stance width. We present
   stability radius, a technique from robust control theory, to overcome
   the limitations of classical stability analysis tools, such as gain
   margin, which are insufficient for predicting how concurrent changes in
   both biomechanics (plant) and neural control (controller) affect system
   behavior. We first present the theory and then an application to a
   neuromechanical model of frontal-plane standing balance with delayed
   feedback. We show that stability radius can quantify differences in the
   sensitivity of system behavior to parameter changes, and predict that
   narrowing stance width increases system robustness. We further
   demonstrate that selecting combinations of stance width (biomechanics)
   and feedback gains (neural control) that have the same stability radius
   produce similar center-of-mass behavior in simulation. Therefore,
   stability radius may provide a useful tool for understanding
   neuromechanical interactions in movement and could aid in the design of
   devices and therapies for improving motor function.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, a framework is presented for making decisions with
   respect to model development. In particular, the proposed framework is
   applicable whenever a decision-maker (DM) must first choose between
   information sources, and then choose among structurally different
   models. Models serve as representations of reality that help DMs
   understand input-output relationships, answer what-if' questions, and
   find optimal design solutions. Model development seeks to improve the
   accuracy of models, with an ultimate goal of making better design
   decisions. Unfortunately, the desire to develop the most accurate model
   competes with the desire to reduce costs, and the DM is ultimately
   required to make trade-offs when making model development decisions. In
   the proposed framework, conjoint analysis is implemented in order to
   solicit DM preferences for competing attributes, and imprecision in
   attributes are systematically assigned and propagated through the
   framework. Using only preliminary experimentation results from a
   packaging design example, the framework is demonstrated to support model
   development decision-making under uncertainty. The primary contribution
   to model development is the capability of the framework to
   simultaneously evaluate multiple information sources and structurally
   different models.}},

Abstract = {{The cognitive demand required for a range of locomotor tasks has been
   described for a variety of populations. However, the effect of different
   training strategies on the cognitive demand required while learning
   novel locomotor tasks is not well understood and may inform physical
   rehabilitation. The authors examined whether two training strategies,
   gradual and sudden training, influenced the cognitive demand required
   while practicing a novel locomotor task, asymmetric split-belt treadmill
   walking. Simple reaction times and whole-body kinematics were recorded
   throughout practice. Gradual training resulted in significantly lower
   reaction times during much of training, suggesting that gradual training
   is less cognitively demanding than sudden training, possibly due to a
   reduction in error feedback or movement planning demands.}},

Abstract = {{Glucosamine (GlcN) and its acetylated derivative, N-acetylglucosamine
   (GlcNAc), are widely used in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical
   industries. Currently, GlcN and GlcNAc are mainly produced by hydrolysis
   from crab and shrimp shells, which can cause severe environmental
   pollution and carries the potential risk of allergic reactions. In this
   study, we attempted to achieve microbial production of GlcNAc by pathway
   engineering of Bacillus subtilis 168. Specifically, glmS (encoding
   GlcN-6-phosphate synthase) from B. subtilis 168 and GNA1 (encoding
   GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   S288C were firstly co-overexpressed in B. subtilis; the level of GlcNAc
   reached 240 mg/L in shake flask culture. Next, nagP, encoding the
   GlcNAc-specific enzyme of phosphotransferase system, was deleted to
   block the importation of extracellular GlcNAC, thus improving GlcNAc
   production to 615 mg/L in shake flask culture. Then, nagA (encoding
   GlcNAc-6-phosphate deacetylase), gamA (encoding GlcN-6-phosphate
   deaminase), and nagB (encoding GlcN-6-phosphate deaminase) were deleted
   to block the catabolism of intracellular GlcNAc, thereby further
   increasing the GlcNAc titer to 1.85 g/L in shake flask culture. Finally,
   microbial production of GlcNAc by the engineered B. subtilis 168 was
   conducted in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor, and the GlcNAc titer reached
   5.19 g/L, which was 2.8-fold of that in shake flask culture. This is the
   first report regarding the pathway engineering of B. subtilis for
   microbial production of GlcNAc, and provides a good starting point for
   further metabolic engineering to achieve the industrial production of
   GlcNAc by a generally regarded as safe strain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease can be efficiently
   targeted to genomic loci by means of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to
   enable genome editing(1-10). Here, we characterize SpCas9 targeting
   specificity in human cells to inform the selection of target sites and
   avoid off-target effects. Our study evaluates >700 guide RNA variants
   and SpCas9-induced indel mutation levels at >100 predicted genomic
   off-target loci in 293T and 293FT cells. We find that SpCas9 tolerates
   mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA at different positions in a
   sequence-dependent manner, sensitive to the number, position and
   distribution of mismatches. We also show that SpCas9-mediated cleavage
   is unaffected by DNA methylation and that the dosage of SpCas9 and sgRNA
   can be titrated to minimize off-target modification. To facilitate
   mammalian genome engineering applications, we provide a web-based
   software tool to guide the selection and validation of target sequences
   as well as off-target analyses.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sparse approximation is an important optimization problem in signal and
   image processing applications. A Hopfield-Network-like system of
   integrate and fire (IF) neurons is proposed as a solution, using the
   Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to solve an overcomplete L1 sparse
   approximation problem. A scalable system architecture is described,
   including IF neurons with a nonlinear firing function, and current-based
   synapses to provide linear computation. A network of 18 neurons with 12
   inputs is implemented on the RASP 2.9v chip, a Field Programmable Analog
   Array (FPAA) with directly programmable floating gate elements. Said
   system uses over 1400 floating gates, the largest system programmed on a
   FPAA to date. The circuit successfully reproduced the outputs of a
   digital optimization program, converging to within 4.8\% RMS, and an
   objective cost only 1.7\% higher on average. The active circuit consumed
   559 mu A of current at 2.4 V and converges on solutions in 25 mu s, with
   measurement of the converged spike rate taking an additional 1 ms.
   Extrapolating the scaling trends to a N = 1000 node system, the spiking
   LCA compares favorably with state-of-the-art digital solutions, and
   analog solutions using a non-spiking approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{NUCLEAR FUSION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Joint experiment/theory/modelling research has led to increased
   confidence in predictions of the pedestal height in ITER. This work was
   performed as part of a US Department of Energy Joint Research Target in
   FY11 to identify physics processes that control the H-mode pedestal
   structure. The study included experiments on C-Mod, DIII-D and NSTX as
   well as interpretation of experimental data with theory-based modelling
   codes. This work provides increased confidence in the ability of models
   for peeling-ballooning stability, bootstrap current, pedestal width and
   pedestal height scaling to make correct predictions, with some areas
   needing further work also being identified. A model for pedestal
   pressure height has made good predictions in existing machines for a
   range in pressure of a factor of 20. This provides a solid basis for
   predicting the maximum pedestal pressure height in ITER, which is found
   to be an extrapolation of a factor of 3 beyond the existing data set.
   Models were studied for a number of processes that are proposed to play
   a role in the pedestal n(e) and T-e profiles. These processes include
   neoclassical transport, paleoclassical transport, electron temperature
   gradient turbulence and neutral fuelling. All of these processes may be
   important, with the importance being dependent on the plasma regime.
   Studies with several electromagnetic gyrokinetic codes show that the
   gradients in and on top of the pedestal can drive a number of
   instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In clinical intensive care unit practice, sedative/analgesic agents are
   titrated to achieve a specific level of sedation. The level of sedation
   is currently based on clinical scoring systems. Examples include the
   motor activity assessment scale, the Richmond agitation-sedation scale,
   and the modified Ramsay sedation scale. In general, the goal of the
   clinician is to find the drug dose that maintains the patient at a
   sedation score corresponding to a moderately sedated state. This is
   typically done empirically, administering a drug dose that usually is in
   the effective range for most patients, observing the patient's response,
   and then adjusting the dose accordingly. However, the response of
   patients to any drug dose is a reflection of the pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic properties of the drug and the specific patient. In this
   paper, we use pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling to find an
   optimal drug dosing control policy to drive the patient to a desired
   modified Ramsay sedation scale score. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Water disinfection tanks such as chlorine and ozone contactors typically
   consist of multiple compartments featuring a serpentine flow pattern.
   Due to the complex hydrodynamics, the design and optimization of these
   tanks are often carried out by employing computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations. The present study demonstrates the influence of
   certain modeling aspects when the widely used Reynolds-Averaged Navier
   Stokes (RANS) based CFD approach to predict hydrodynamics and
   disinfection performance is employed. Three different contact tank
   geometries are examined numerically using RANS. The time-averaged
   velocity predictions are reasonably accurate when compared to validation
   data. However, in baffled contact tanks, the time-averaged flow differs
   quite significantly from the instantaneous flow, with the consequence
   that RANS-based models require careful calibration of the turbulent
   mixing parameter, i.e., the turbulent Schmidt number, when computing
   transport of solutes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic engineering has been successful in generating highly efficient
   Escherichia coli catalysts for production of biofuels and other useful
   products. However, most of these engineered biocatalysts are only
   effective when glucose is used as the starting substrate. Strategies to
   overcome this limitation in the past almost exclusively relied on
   extracellular secretion or surface display of a beta-glucosidase. We
   show here, for the first time, a periplasmic expression of a
   Sacchrophagus degradans cellodextrinase (Ced3A) as a successful strategy
   to enable E. coli to use cellodextrin. The engineered strain was able to
   grow with cellodextrin as sole carbon source. Additionally, we show that
   penetration of cellodextrin into periplasmic space was enhanced by using
   a mutant with leaky outer membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
   catalyst can efficiently ferment cellodextrin to lactic acid with about
   80 \% yield. The ability of a biocatalyst to use cellodextrin should
   make it useful in consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the ARIES study, the Georgia Tech group has experimentally
   studied the thermal performance of a helium-cooled `finger-type'
   tungsten divertor design that uses jet impingement and a fin array to
   cool the plasma-facing surface. These studies were performed using air
   at Reynolds numbers Re, spanning those for prototypical operating
   conditions. A brass test section heated with an oxy-acetylene torch at
   incident heat fluxes up to 2 MW/m(2) was used. Recently, data obtained
   with room-temperature helium suggests that dynamic similarity between
   the air and helium experiments cannot be achieved by only matching Re
   because of the difference in the relative contributions of convection
   and conduction through the annular side walls of the divertor. Numerical
   simulations suggest that achieving dynamic similarity requires matching
   the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the divertor module material to
   that of the coolant under operating conditions, as well as Re.
   Studies were performed to verify that experiments at the prototypical Re
   and thermal conductivity ratio using helium at room temperature give
   Nusselt numbers Nu that are dynamically similar to those at prototypical
   operating conditions. Given that the thermal conductivity of helium
   decreases as temperature decreases, matching of the thermal conductivity
   ratio required a carbon steel test section with a thermal conductivity
   much lower than that of the brass alloy previously used. The resulting
   ratio of the test section to coolant thermal conductivities is similar
   to that of the tungsten alloy and helium at prototypical conditions. The
   data were used to verify generalized correlations for Nu, as a function
   of Re and the thermal conductivity ratio. The correlations can be used
   to determine the maximum heat flux that can be accommodated by the
   divertor at prototypical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A power-efficient wireless stimulating system for a head-mounted deep
   brain stimulator (DBS) is presented. A new adaptive rectifier generates
   a variable DC supply voltage from a constant AC power carrier utilizing
   phase control feedback, while achieving high AC-DC power conversion
   efficiency (PCE) through active synchronous switching. A
   current-controlled stimulator adopts closed-loop supply control to
   automatically adjust the stimulation compliance voltage by detecting
   stimulation site potentials through a voltage readout channel, and
   improve the stimulation efficiency. The stimulator also utilizes
   closed-loop active charge balancing to maintain the residual charge at
   each site within a safe limit, while receiving the stimulation
   parameters wirelessly from the amplitude-shift-keyed power carrier. A
   4-ch wireless stimulating system prototype was fabricated in a 0.5-mu m
   3M2P standard CMOS process, occupying 2.25 mm(2). With 5 V peak AC input
   at 2 MHz, the adaptive rectifier provides an adjustable DC output
   between 2.5 V and 4.6 V at 2.8 mA loading, resulting in measured PCE of
   72 similar to 87\%. The adaptive supply control increases the
   stimulation efficiency up to 30\% higher than a fixed supply voltage to
   58 similar to 68\%. The prototype wireless stimulating system was

Abstract = {{In IPTV networks, channel change latency represents a major concern in
   achieving broadcast-level service quality. Bandwidth limitations at the
   user side prevents the clients from receiving all the channels at once.
   As a result, most of the requests have to go through the network leading
   to significant delays during the channel change process. In this paper,
   we address this latency problem in IPTV networks by proposing a novel
   channel reordering technique that exploits the differing key-frame
   delivery times for the adjacent sessions to dynamically arrange the
   switching order during the surfing periods. The simulation results show
   that, compared to static channel ordering techniques, the proposed
   framework can achieve more than 50\% improvement in channel change
   latency without introducing any significant overhead in the network. The
   proposed dynamic reordering technique is also shown to be robust against
   variations observed in channel listings and/or session time-shifts.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{37-49}},

Abstract = {{While abrasive impregnated brushes have been used extensively for
   deburring of machined parts, understanding of the associated mechanics
   of material removal is lacking. This paper investigates the dependence
   of brush deburring rate, surface roughness and change in foil thickness
   on spindle speed and brush nominal penetration during brush deburring of
   25 mu m thick Nitinol (NiTi) foils. Analysis of the surface after
   brushing shows that both ploughing and chip formation occur in the
   process. It is also seen that at bristle tip velocities of about 7 m/s
   the penetration of abrasives into the foil is dominated by initial
   contact forces while at about 2 m/s it is dominated by bristle
   stiffness. Long, slender burrs are removed by fatigue fracture under
   cyclic loading of the bristles. Burr roots are removed in small chunks
   as cracks formed by abrasive indentation propagate under cyclic loading
   of the bristles. A model based on Hertzian contact mechanics is proposed
   to predict the rate of indentation during brushing and is validated
   using experiments. The surface roughness initially reduces but
   subsequently increases with further brushing. Change in foil thickness
   in all cases is <= 1 mu m. A fracture mechanics model for predicting the
   deburring rate is also proposed and validated. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A MEMS lamination technology based on sequential multilayer
   electrodeposition is presented. The process comprises three main steps:
   (1) automated sequential electrodeposition of permalloy (Ni80Fe20)
   structural and copper sacrificial layers to form multilayer structures
   of significant total thickness; (2) fabrication of polymeric anchor
   structures through the thickness of the multilayer structures and (3)
   selective removal of copper. The resulting structure is a set of
   air-insulated permalloy laminations, the separation of which is
   sustained by insulating polymeric anchor structures. Individual
   laminations have precisely controllable thicknesses ranging from 500 nm
   to 5 mu m, and each lamination layer is electrically isolated from
   adjacent layers by narrow air gaps of similar scale. In addition to air,
   interlamination insulators based on polymers are investigated.
   Interlamination air gaps with very high aspect ratio (>1:100) can be
   filled with polyvinylalcohol and polydimethylsiloxane. The laminated
   structures are characterized using scanning electron microscopy and
   atomic force microscopy to directly examine properties such as the
   roughness and the thickness uniformity of the layers. In addition, the
   quality of the electrical insulation between the laminations is
   evaluated by quantifying the eddy current within the sample as a
   function of frequency. Fabricated laminations are comprised of uniform,
   smooth (surface roughness < 100 nm) layers with effective electrical
   insulation for all layer thicknesses and insulator approaches studied.
   Such highly laminated structures have potential uses ranging from energy
   conversion to applications where composite materials with highly
   anisotropic mechanical or thermal properties are required.}},

Title = {{A Local Incident Flux Response Expansion Transport Method for Coupling

Abstract = {{A local incident flux response expansion transport method is developed
   to generate transport solutions for coupling to diffusion theory codes
   regardless of their solution method (e.g., fine mesh, nodal, response
   based, finite element, etc.) for reactor core calculations in both
   two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) cylindrical
   geometries. In this approach, a Monte Carlo method is first used to
   precompute the local transport solution (i.e., response function
   library) for each unique transport coarse node, in which diffusion
   theory is not valid due to strong transport effects. The response
   function library is then used to iteratively determine the albedo
   coefficients on the diffusion-transport interfaces, which are then used
   as the coupling parameters within the diffusion code. This interface
   coupling technique allows a seamless integration of the transport and
   diffusion methods. The new method retains the detailed heterogeneity of
   the transport nodes and naturally constructs any local solution within
   them by a simple superposition of local responses to all incoming fluxes
   from the contiguous coarse nodes. A new technique is also developed for
   coupling to fine-mesh diffusion methods/codes. The local transport
   method/module is tested in 2-D and 3-D pebble-bed reactor benchmark
   problems consisting of an inner reflector, an annular fuel region, and a
   controlled outer reflector. It is found that the results predicted by
   the transport module agree very well with the reference fluxes
   calculated directly by MCNP in both benchmark problems.}},

Abstract = {{On 12 January 2010, a magnitude M (w) 7.0 earthquake occurred 25 km
   west-southwest of Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince causing an estimated
   316,000 fatalities, thereby exceeding any previous loss of life from a
   similar size earthquake. In addition, tsunami waves triggered by the
   earthquake caused at least three fatalities at Petit Paradis due to a
   complete lack of tsunami awareness. The International Tsunami Survey
   Team (ITST) was deployed within weeks of the event and covered the
   greater Bay of Port-au-Prince and more than 100 km of Hispaniola's
   southern coastline. The collected survey data include more than 21

Abstract = {{Regional air quality model simulations with Community Multiscale Air
   Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) were evaluated using multiple platforms
   for a 2-month summer period. In this context, inter-comparisons of the
   model with available satellite-based observations of NO2, ground-and
   aircraft-based observations of NO, NO2, NOx, NOy, and O-3 were
   performed. NO2 comparisons found low biases in CMAQ results when using
   both ground-and satellite-based observations. Aircraft-based
   observations, on the other hand, indicated a higher positive bias and
   error, but the overall NO2 vertical profile was captured well by
   themodel. The highest correlation was observed with satellite-based NO2
   observations indicating that the model and satellite found similar
   spatial gradients. NO concentrations were underestimated in comparison
   with both ground- and aircraft-based observations, especially near the
   surface, indicating the limitations of the model to simulate primary
   pollutant concentrations at point observations when there are sources
   nearby. NOy comparisons found positive biases in the model when using
   both ground-and aircraft-based observations. The main reason for this
   overestimation was the consistent overestimation of peroxyacyl nitrates
   (PANs) in CMAQ results. Modeled O-3 concentrations compared well with
   lowest biases and errors when compared to aircraft-and ground-based
   observations. The O-3 vertical profile indicated a small positive bias
   in the model results near the surface similar to the comparison with
   ground-based observations. However, a negative bias in the model was
   observed above 2 km. Comparison with aircraft-based observations
   revealed significant overestimations in PAN and OH concentrations.
   Overestimation of the modeled OH concentrations is particularly
   important considering the effect of OH in atmospheric reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a central role in cell behavior on
   biomaterial surfaces and influences various cell functions.
   Photoactivatable RGD adhesive peptides were used to investigate the
   effect of the density and time point of bioadhesive ligand presentation
   on cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. PEGylated
   self-assembled monolayers were functionalized with RGD and caged RGD
   ligands and seeded with C2C12 myoblasts. The cultures were irradiated at
   various time points between 1 and 48 h after cell seeding in order to
   increase RGD surface concentration at defined time points. Attachment,
   spreading and myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts strongly
   varied with the density of RGD at the surface. Proliferation and
   myogenesis were further regulated by the time point at which RGD was
   presented to the cell, reaching highest levels when RGD exposure
   occurred <= 6 h after cell seeding. These results provide fundamental
   insights in cell-biomaterial interactions of C2C12 myoblasts in terms of
   temporal integrin-mediated cell responses. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered vascular grafts require long fabrication times, in
   part due to the requirement of cells from a variety of cell sources to
   produce a robust, load-bearing extracellular matrix. Herein, we propose
   a design strategy for the fabrication of tubular conduits comprising
   collagen fiber networks and elastin-like protein polymers to mimic
   native tissue structure and function. Dense fibrillar collagen networks
   exhibited an ultimate tensile strength CUTS) of 0.71 +/- 0.06 MPa,
   strain to failure of 37.1 +/- 2.2\% and Young's modulus of 2.09 +/- 0.42
   MPa, comparing favorably to a UTS and a Young's modulus for native blood
   vessels of 1.4-11.1 MPa and 1.5 +/- 0.3 MPa, respectively. Resilience, a
   measure of recovered energy during unloading of matrices, demonstrated
   that 58.9 +/- 4.4\% of the energy was recovered during loading-unloading
   cycles. Rapid fabrication of multilayer tubular conduits with
   maintenance of native collagen ultrastructure was achieved with internal
   diameters ranging between 1 and 4 mm. Compliance and burst pressures
   exceeded 2.7 +/- 0.3\%/100 mmHg and 830 +/- 131 mmHg, respectively, with
   a significant reduction in observed platelet adherence as compared to
   expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE; 6.8 +/- 0.05 x 10(5) vs. 62 +/-
   0.05 x 10(5) platelets mm(-2), p < 0.01). Using a rat aortic
   interposition model, early in vivo responses were evaluated at 2 weeks
   via Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography with immunohistochemistry
   confirming a limited early inflammatory response (n = 8). Engineered
   collagen-elastin composites represent a promising strategy for
   fabricating synthetic tissues with defined extracellular matrix content,

Abstract = {{Skin vaccination with influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) using
   microneedles has been shown to induce protection similar to or better
   than that induced by intramuscular immunization. In this study, we
   examined the long-term protective efficacy of influenza (H1N1 A/PR/8/34)
   VLPs after skin vaccination using microneedle patches coated with the
   vaccine. Microneedle vaccination of mice in the skin induced 100\%
   protection against lethal challenge infection with influenza A/PR/8/34
   virus 14 months after a single vaccine dose. Influenza virus-specific
   total IgG response and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were
   maintained at high levels for over 1 year after microneedle vaccination.
   Microneedle vaccination also induced substantial levels of lung IgG and
   IgA antibody responses, and antibody-secreting plasma cells from spleen
   and bone marrow, as well as conferring effective control of lung viral
   loads, resulting in complete protection 14 months after vaccination.
   These strong and long-lasting immune responses were enabled in part by
   stabilization of the vaccine by formulation with trehalose during
   microneedle patch fabrication. Administration of the stabilized vaccine
   using microneedles was especially effective at enabling strong recall
   responses measured 4 days after lethal virus challenge, including
   increased HAI and antibody-secreting cells in the spleen and reduced
   viral titer and inflammatory response in the lung. The results in this
   study indicate that skin vaccination with VLP vaccine using a
   microneedle patch provides long-term protection against influenza in
   mice.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the effect of partial channel state
   information on the achievable secure communication rates and secret-key
   generation rates over ergodic fading channels. In particular, we
   establish the strong secret-key capacity as well as lower bounds for the
   strong secrecy capacity of ergodic and block-ergodic fading channels
   with partial Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). Our
   analysis sheds light on the usefulness of CSIT to harness the benefits
   of fading for secrecy and allows us to quantify the penalty incurred by
   the lack of full CSIT. In particular, we numerically illustrate
   situations in which little CSIT is required to recover most of the
   benefits of fading and in which the legitimate terminals have an
   incentive to precisely characterize their channel.}},

Abstract = {{An important problem of neuroimaging data analysis for traumatic brain
   injury (TBI) is the task of coregistering MR volumes acquired using
   distinct sequences in the presence of widely variable pixel movements
   which are due to the presence and evolution of pathology. We are
   motivated by this problem to design a numerically stable registration
   algorithm which handles large deformations. To this end, we propose a
   new measure of probability distributions based on the Bhattacharyya
   distance, which is more stable than the widely used mutual information
   due to better behavior of the square root function than the logarithm at
   zero. Robustness is illustrated on two TBI patient datasets, each
   containing 12 MR modalities. We implement our method on graphics
   processing units (GPU) so as to meet the clinical requirement of
   time-efficient processing of TBI data. We find that 6 sare required to
   register a pair of volumes with matrix sizes of 256 x 256 x 60 on the
   GPU. In addition to exceptional time efficiency via its GPU
   implementation, this methodology provides a clinically informative
   method for the mapping and evaluation of anatomical changes in TBI.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated magnetic resonance imaging techniques reduce signal
   acquisition time by undersampling k-space. A fundamental problem in
   accelerated magnetic resonance imaging is the recovery of quality images
   from undersampled k-space data. Current state-of-the-art recovery
   algorithms exploit the spatial and temporal structures in underlying
   images to improve the reconstruction quality. In recent years,
   compressed sensing theory has helped formulate mathematical principles
   and conditions that ensure recovery of (structured) sparse signals from
   undersampled, incoherent measurements. In this article, a new recovery
   algorithm, motion-adaptive spatio-temporal regularization, is presented
   that uses spatial and temporal structured sparsity of MR images in the
   compressed sensing framework to recover dynamic MR images from highly
   undersampled k-space data. In contrast to existing algorithms, our
   proposed algorithm models temporal sparsity using motion-adaptive linear
   transformations between neighboring images. The efficiency of
   motion-adaptive spatio-temporal regularization is demonstrated with
   experiments on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for a range of
   reduction factors. Results are also compared with k-t FOCUSS with motion
   estimation and compensationanother recently proposed recovery algorithm
   for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging. Magn Reson Med 70:800-812, 2013.

Abstract = {{Emulation of the sensation of touch through high-resolution electronic

   light-emitting diode-based pressure sensor array can map two-dimensional
   distributions of strain with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 2.7
   mu m, corresponding to a pixel density of 6,350 dpi. Each pixel is
   composed of a single n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN light-emitting diode, the
   emission intensity of which depends on the local strain owing to the
   piezo-phototronic effect. A pressure map can be created by reading out,
   in parallel, the electroluminescent signal from all of the pixels with a
   time resolution of 90 ms. The device may represent a major step towards
   the digital imaging of mechanical signals by optical means, with

Abstract = {{In the traditional Markov chain model (MCM), aleatory uncertainty
   because of inherent randomness and epistemic uncertainty due to the lack

   provides a concise representation for the two kinds of uncertainties

   based on the generalized interval probability theory, is proposed to
   improve the reliability of prediction. In the GMCM, aleatory uncertainty
   is represented as probability; interval is used to capture epistemic
   uncertainty. A case study for predicting the average dynamic compliance
   in machining processes is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   proposed GMCM. The results show that the proposed GMCM has a better

Abstract = {{This paper develops and estimates a multiple discrete continuous extreme
   value model of household activity generation that jointly predicts the
   activity participation decisions of all individuals in a household by
   activity purpose and the precise combination of individuals
   participating. The model is estimated on a sample obtained from the post
   census regional household travel survey conducted by the South
   California Association of Governments in the year 2000. A host of
   household, individual, and residential neighborhood accessibility
   measures are used as explanatory variables. The results reveal that, in
   addition to household and individual demographics, the built environment
   of the home zone also impacts the activity participation levels and
   durations of households. A validation exercise is undertaken to evaluate
   the ability of the proposed model to predict participation levels and
   durations. In addition to providing richness in behavioral detail, the
   model can be easily embedded in an activity-based microsimulation
   framework and is computationally efficient as it obviates the need for
   several hierarchical sub-models typically used in extant activity-based
   systems to generate activity patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene/ethane separation via cryogenic distillation is extremely
   energy-intensive, and membrane separation may provide an attractive

   theoretical prediction of the ethylene/ethane upper bound is also
   presented, and shows good agreement with the experimental upper bound.
   Further, two ways to overcome the ethylene/ethane upper bound, based on
   increasing the sorption or diffusion selectivity, is also discussed, and
   a review on advanced membrane types such as facilitated transport
   membranes, zeolite and metal organic framework based membranes, and
   carbon molecular sieve membranes is presented. Of these, carbon
   membranes have shown the potential to surpass the polymeric
   ethylene/ethane upper bound performance. Furthermore, a convenient,
   potentially scalable method for tailoring the performance of carbon
   membranes for ethylene/ethane separation based on tuning the pyrolysis
   conditions has also been demonstrated. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Objective-On the basis of previous evidence that polymerase delta
   interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) increases reduced nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (Nox4) activity in vascular
   smooth muscle cells, we hypothesized that in vivo knockdown of Poldip2
   would inhibit reactive oxygen species production and alter vascular
   function.
   Approach and Results-Because homozygous Poldip2 deletion is lethal,
   Poldip2(+/-) mice were used. Poldip2 mRNA and protein levels were
   reduced by approximate to 50\% in Poldip2(+/-) aorta, with no change in
   p22phox, Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 mRNAs. NADPH oxidase activity was also
   inhibited in Poldip2(+/-) tissue. Isolated aortas from Poldip2(+/-) mice
   demonstrated impaired phenylephrine and potassium chloride-induced
   contractions, increased stiffness, and reduced compliance associated
   with disruption of elastic lamellae and excessive extracellular matrix
   deposition. Collagen I secretion was elevated in cultured vascular
   smooth muscle cells from Poldip2(+/-) mice and restored by H2O2
   supplementation, suggesting that this novel function of Poldip2 is
   mediated by reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, Poldip2(+/-) mice were
   protected against aortic dilatation in a model of experimental aneurysm,
   an effect consistent with increased collagen secretion.
   Conclusions-Poldip2 knockdown reduces H2O2 production in vivo, leading
   to increases in extracellular matrix, greater vascular stiffness, and
   impaired agonist-mediated contraction. Thus, unaltered expression of
   Poldip2 is necessary for vascular integrity and function.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{1213-1222}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a methodology has been developed to accurately predict
   the elastic properties of multi-constituent particulate composites by
   accounting for irreversible effects, such as energy loss that arises due
   to internal friction. The complex dependence on loading density and
   particle properties (i.e., size, shape, morphology, etc.) is
   investigated in terms of their effects on the effective elastic modulus
   of the composite. Confirmed by experimental data from the compression
   loading of individual Ni and Al particles dispersed in an epoxy matrix,
   it is believed that this approach captures the effects of internal
   friction, consequently providing a more accurate and comprehensive
   representation for predicting and understanding the material behavior of
   multi-constituent particulate reinforced composites. The present
   methodology provides a model to directly compare the elastic modulus
   from an uncomplicated test, such as dual-cantilever beam loading in
   dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), to the modulus obtained by other more
   complex experimental methods such as quasi-static compression. The model
   illustrates an efficient method to incorporate input data from DMA to
   represent realistic elastic moduli, hence promising for the
   characterization and design of particulate composites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the convergence rate of a continuous-time dynamical
   system for l(1)-minimization, known as the Locally Competitive Algorithm
   (LCA). Solving l(1)-minimization problems efficiently and rapidly is of
   great interest to the signal processing community, as these programs
   have been shown to recover sparse solutions to underdetermined systems
   of linear equations and come with strong performance guarantees. The LCA
   under study differs from the typical l(1)-solver in that it operates in
   continuous time: instead of being specified by discrete iterations, it
   evolves according to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations. The LCA is constructed from simple components, giving it the
   potential to be implemented as a large-scale analog circuit. The goal of
   this paper is to give guarantees on the convergence time of the LCA
   system. To do so, we analyze how the LCA evolves as it is recovering a
   sparse signal from underdetermined measurements. We show that under
   appropriate conditions on the measurement matrix and the problem
   parameters, the path the LCA follows can be described as a sequence of
   linear differential equations, each with a small number of active
   variables. This allows us to relate the convergence time of the system
   to the restricted isometry constant of the matrix. Interesting parallels
   to sparse-recovery digital solvers emerge from this study. Our analysis
   covers both the noisy and noiseless settings and is supported by
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a cooperative control architecture for
   high-order multivehicle systems having non-identical nonlinear uncertain
   dynamics. The proposed methodology consists of a local cooperative
   controller and a vehicle-level controller for each vehicle. The former
   controller receives the relative output measurements of the neighbouring
   vehicles in order to solve a containment problem formulated on a
   leader-follower framework. Specifically, the leaders generate
   trajectories in which the vehicles (followers) converge to the convex
   hull formed by those of the leaders. For a special case with one leader,
   this controller synchronises the output of the vehicles with the output
   of the leader. The latter controller receives the internal-state
   measurements for suppressing the nonlinear uncertain dynamics of the
   vehicle by using a decentralised adaptive control approach. The
   interaction topology between vehicles is described by undirected graphs
   and extensions to directed graphs are further discussed. The stability
   and convergence properties of the proposed cooperative control
   architecture are analysed by using the results from linear algebra and
   the Lyapunov theory. Several numerical examples are provided to
   demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cooperative control

Abstract = {{A disc microreactor with constructal tree-shaped flow architecture is
   introduced for methanol steam reforming. For this design, a
   three-dimensional model is developed and analyzed numerically to predict
   the resulting hydrogen production. The methanol conversion ratio, yield
   of hydrogen production in the product of the tree-shaped microreactor,
   are all evaluated and compared with the corresponding microreactor using
   a parallel flow pattern. In addition, the effect of branching level,
   steam to methanol ratio (SMR), and inlet velocity on the reaction
   performance of the microreactor with a constructal tree-shaped network
   are also investigated and discussed. The results indicate that the
   methanol conversion in the disc tree-shaped microreactor is more than
   10\% better than that of a parallel microreactor. Furthermore, the yield
   of hydrogen at the outlet of the disc tree-shaped microreator is greater
   than the parallel flow configuration. The CO concentration in the
   products of the disc tree-shaped microreactor is higher than that of
   parallel microreactor. In addition, the disc tree-shaped microreactor
   with a larger branch level behaves enhanced performance on the methanol
   conversion and hydrogen production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   be easily hydrolyzed to free 3-NPA by bacterial enzymes in the gut of
   animals. In addition to providing a defense mechanism, the nitro
   compound is an intermediate in the nitrification process of leguminous
   plants. The synthesis of 3-NPA in these plants and fungi is poorly
   understood. P3N, which readily forms from 3-NPA at physiological pH, is
   a potent inhibitor of the key enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in the
   Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. Inhibition of succinate
   dehydrogenase in humans and livestock causes neurotoxicity and in some
   cases death. Several enzymes catalyze the oxidation of 3-NPA or P3N; all
   contain a noncovalently bound flavin cofactor and are found in the
   organisms that produce 3-NPA. With k(cat)/K-m values of >10(6) M-1
   s(-1), nitronate monooxygenases can quickly and efficiently oxidize P3N
   to malonic semialdehyde as a means of protecting the organism from
   killing itself. Although it was discovered almost a century ago, the
   biochemistry and physiological role of 3-NPA/P3N are just emerging. (c)

Abstract = {{Test-suite augmentation techniques enhance test suites for software
   changes. In previous work, we introduced an augmentation technique that
   enumerates the conditions for the propagation of the effects of changes.
   Empirical studies showed that this technique can test changes
   effectively but, because of the high complexity of the technique, the
   experiments were small and the propagation distances from each change
   were limited. In this paper, we present a new, demand-driven approach
   for performing this propagation-based testing of changes that achieves
   much greater distances and that enables larger and more significant
   studies. We implemented this new approach and studied it on a set of
   changes in Java programs by comparing, to a larger extent than possible
   before, propagation-based strategies with other change testing
   techniques. Our results confirm, with statistical significance, the
   superiority of propagation-based strategies over other techniques, and
   show that these strategies are especially effective for those changes
   that are the most difficult to test.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&
